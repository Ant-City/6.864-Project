_the background represents the front of the castle of_ pentheus, _king
    of thebes. at one side is visible the sacred tomb of semelê, a
    little enclosure overgrown with wild vines, with a cleft in the
    rocky floor of it from which there issues at times steam or smoke.
    the god_ dionysus _is discovered alone_.

                  dionysus.

behold, god's son is come unto this land
of thebes, even i, dionysus, whom the brand
of heaven's hot splendour lit to life, when she
who bore me, cadmus' daughter semelê,
died here. so, changed in

bes, hath this my magic goaded out.
and there, with the old king's daughters, in a rout
confused, they make their dwelling-place between
the roofless rocks and shadowy pine trees green.
thus shall this thebes, how sore soe'er it smart,
learn and forget not, till she crave her part
in mine adoring; thus must i speak clear
to save my mother's fame, and crown me here
as true god, born by semelê to zeus.

  now cadmus yieldeth up his throne and use
of royal honour to his daughter's son
pentheus; who on my body hath begun
a war with god. he thrusteth me away
from due drink-offering, and, when men pray,
my name entreats not. therefore on his own
head and his people's shall my power be shown.
then to another land, when all things here
are well, must i fare onward, making clear
my godhead's might. but should this theban town
essay with wrath and battle to drag down
my maids, lo, in their path myself shall be,
and maniac armies battled after me!
for this i veil my godhead with t

their dances up kithaeron's pine-clad side.

    eastern women, the light of the sunrise streaming upon their long
    white robes and ivy-bound hair. they wear fawn-skins over the robes,
    and carry some of them timbrels, some pipes and other instruments.
    many bear the thyrsus, or sacred wand, made of reed ringed with ivy.

  aye, men will rail that i forget my years,

to mark what man shall dance, or young or old;

oh, make thine habitation here with us,
not lonely, against men's uses. hazardous
is this quick bird-like beating of thy thought
where no thought dwells.--grant that this god be naught,
yet let that naught be somewhat in thy mouth;
lie boldly, and say he is! so north and south
shall marvel, how there sprang a thing divine
from semelê's flesh, and honour all our line.
                              [_drawing nearer to_ pentheus.
  is there not blood before thine eyes even now?
our lost actaeon's blood, whom long ago
his own red hounds through yonder forest dim
tore unto death, because he vaunted him
against most holy artemis? oh, beware,
and let me wreathe thy temples. make thy prayer
with us, and walk thee humbly in god's sight.

ye damsels of the morning hills, why lie ye thus dismayed?
ye marked him, then, our master, and the mighty hand he laid
on tower and rock, shaking the house of pentheus?--but arise,
and cast the trembling from your flesh, and lift untroubled eyes.

o light in darkness, is it thou? o priest, is this thy face?
my heart leaps out to greet thee from the deep of loneliness.

for when he led me down, behold, before the stall there stood
a bull of offering. and this king, he bit his lips, and straight
fell on and bound it, hoof and limb, with gasping wrath and sweat.
and i sat watching!--then a voice; and lo, our lord was come,
and the house shook, and a great flame stood o'er his mother's tomb.
and pentheus hied this way and that, and called his thralls amain
for water, lest his roof-tree burn; and all toiled, all in vain.
then deemed a-sudden i was gone; and left his fire, and sped
back to the prison portals, and his lifted sword shone red.
but there, methinks, the god had wrought--i speak but as i guess--
some dream-shape in mine image; for he smote at emptiness,
stabbed in the air, and strove in wrath, as though 'twere me he slew.
then 'mid his dreams god smote him yet again! he overthre

then first in a green dell we stopped, and lay,
lips dumb and feet unmoving, warily
watching, to be unseen and yet to see.
  a narrow glen it was, by crags o'ertowered,
torn through by tossing waters, and there lowered
a shadow of great pines over it. and there
the maenad maidens sate; in toil they were,
busily glad. some with an ivy chain
tracked a worn wand to toss its locks again;
some, wild in joyance, like young

so in those hands that tough and mountain stem
bowed slow--oh, strength not mortal dwelt in them!--
to the very earth. and there he set the king,
and slowly, lest it cast him in its spring,
let back the young and straining tree, till high
it towered again amid the towering sky;
and pentheus in the branches! well, i ween,
he saw the maenads then, and well was seen!
for scarce was he aloft, when suddenly
there was no stranger any more with me,
but out of heaven a voice--oh, what voice else?--
'twas he that called! "behold, o damosels,
i bring ye him who turneth to despite

of the green pine-top, with a shrieking cry
fell, as his mind grew clear, and there hard by
was horror visible. 'twas his mother stood
o'er him, first priestess of those rites of blood.
he tore the coif, and from his head away
flung it, that she might know him, and not slay
to her own misery. he touched the wild
cheek, crying: "mother, it is i, thy child,
thy pentheus, born thee in echîon's hall!
have mercy, mother! let it not befall
through sin of mine, that thou shouldst slay thy son!"
  but she, with lips a-foam and eyes that run

stays not nor hears. round his left arm she put

 god is probably a true god; but even if he is
false, there is no great harm done, and the worship will bring renown to
thebes and the royal family. it is noteworthy how full of pity cadmus
is--the sympathetic kindliness of the sons of this world as contrasted
with the pitilessness of gods and their devotees. see especially the
last scenes of the play. even his final outburst of despair at not dying
like other men (p. 152), shows the same sympathetic humanity.

pp. 89 ff., ll. 215-262.--pentheus, though his case against the new
worship is so good, and he might so easily have been made into a fine
martyr, like hippolytus, is left harsh and unpleasant, and very close in
type to the ordinary "tyrant" of greek tragedy (cf. p. 118). it is also
noteworthy, i think, that he is, as it were, out of tone with the other
characters. he belongs to a different atmosphere, like, to take a recent
instance, golaud in _pelléas et mélisande_.

ordinary material of which phantoms or apparitions were made.

pp. 93-95, ll. 330-369.--these three speeches are very clearly
contrasted. cadmus, thoroughly human, thinking of sympathy and
expediency, and vividly remembering the fate of his other grandson,
actaeon; pentheus, angry and "tyrannical"; teiresias speaking like a
christian priest of the middle ages, almost like tennyson's becket.

p. 95, l. 370.--the goddess [greek: hosia], "purity," seems to be one of
the many abstractions which were half personified by philosophy and by
orphism. it is possible that the word is really adjectival, "immaculate
one," and originally an epithet of some more definite goddess, _e.g._ as
miss harrison suggests, of nemesis.

mysteries, or special forms of worship, certain relics or sacred
implements, without which the rites could not be performed. cf. hdt.
vii. 153, where telines of gela stole the sacred implements or emblems
of the nether gods, so that no worship could be performed, and the town
was, as it were, excommunicated.

p. 103, ll. 493 ff., _the soldiers cut off the tress._]--the stage
directions here are difficult. it is conceivable that none of pentheus'
threats are carried out at all; that the god mysteriously paralyses the
hand that is lifted to take his rod without pentheus himself knowing it.
but i think it more likely that the humiliation of dionysus is made, as
far as externals go, complete, and that it is not till later that he
begins to show his superhuman powers.

by the poet, and written in by his son. but it may be that i have not
understood it.

p. 118, ll. 781 ff., call all who spur the charger, &c.]--the typical
'ercles vein' of the tragic tyrant.

pp. 120-124, ll. 810 ff.--this scene of the 'hypnotising'--if one may
use the word--of pentheus probably depends much on the action, which,
however, i have not ventured to prescribe. pentheus seems to struggle
against the process all through, to be amazed at himself for consenting,
while constantly finding fresh reasons for doing so.

p. 121, l. 822, am i a woman, then?]--the robe and coif were, in the
original legend, marks of the thracian dress worn by the thracian
followers of dionysus, and notably by orpheus. the tradition became
fixed that pentheus wore such a robe and coif;

a hand uplifted over the head of hate." if i am wrong,
the refrain is probably a mere cry for revenge, in the tone of the
refrain, "hither for doom and deed," on p. 132. it is one of the many
passages where there is a sharp antagonism between the two spirits of
the chorus, first, as furious bacchanals, and, secondly, as exponents of
the idealised bacchic religion of euripides, which is so strongly
expressed in the rest of this wonderful lyric.

p. 127, l. 920, is it a wild bull, this?]--pentheus, in his bacchic
possession, sees fitfully the mystic shapes of the god beneath the human
disguise. this second-sight, the exaltation of spirit, and the feeling
of supernatural strength come to pentheus as they came to the two old
men. but to them the change came peacefully and for good; to pentheus it
comes by force, stormily and for evil, because his will was against the
god.

p. 141, _after_ l. 1183, _the leader tries to speak_, &c.]--it is also
possible that by some error of a scribe two lines have been omitted in
