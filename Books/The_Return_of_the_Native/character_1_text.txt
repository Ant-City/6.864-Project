“she’s not there.”
“how do you know?”
“because she’s here. she’s in my van,” he added slowly.
“what new trouble has come?” murmured mrs. yeobright, putting her hand over her eyes.
“i can’t explain much, ma’am. all i know is that, as i was going along the road this morning, about a mile out of anglebury, i heard something trotting after me like a doe, and looking round there she was, white as death itself. ‘oh, diggory venn!’ she said, ‘i thought ‘twas you—will you help me? i am in trouble.’”
“how did she know your christian name?” said mrs. yeobright doubtingly.
“i had met her as a lad before i went away in this trade. she asked then if she might ride, and then down she fell in a faint. i picked her up and put her in, and there she has been ever since. she has cried a good deal, but she has hardly spoke; all she has told me being that she was to have been married this morning. i tried to get her

ee if he has returned. of course i shall get to the bottom of this story at once. mr. wildeve must not suppose he can play tricks upon me, or any belonging to me.”
“it was not that. the license was wrong, and he couldn’t get another the same day. he will tell you in a moment how it was, if he comes.”
“why didn’t he bring you back?”
“that was me!” again sobbed thomasin. “when i found we could not be married i didn’t like to come back with him, and i was very ill. then i saw diggory venn, and was glad to get him to take me home. i cannot explain it any better, and you must be angry with me if you will.”
“i shall see about that,” said mrs. yeobright; and they turned towards the inn, known in the neighbourhood as the quiet woman, the sign of which represented the figure of a matron carrying her head under her arm, beneath which gruesome design was written the couplet so well known to frequenters of the inn:—

he only seat in the van, and, examining his packet by the light of a candle, took thence an old letter and spread it open. the writing had originally been traced on white paper, but the letter had now assumed a pale red tinge from the accident of its situation; and the black strokes of writing thereon looked like the twigs of a winter hedge against a vermilion sunset. the letter bore a date some two years previous to that time, and was signed “thomasin yeobright.” it ran as follows:—
dear diggory venn,—the question you put when you overtook me coming home from pond-close gave me such a surprise that i am afraid i did not make you exactly understand what i meant. of course, if my aunt had not met me i could have explained all then at once, but as it was there was no chance. i have been quite uneasy since, as you know i do not wish to pain you, yet i fear i shall be doing so now in contradicting what i seemed to say then. i cannot, diggory, marry you, or think of letting you call me your swe

enn. “if she is willing to see me, will she please send out word, and i’ll come in.”
the reddleman left the house and loitered on the hill adjoining. a considerable time elapsed, and no request for his presence was brought. he was beginning to think that his scheme had failed, when he beheld the form of eustacia herself coming leisurely towards him. a sense of novelty in giving audience to that singular figure had been sufficient to draw her forth.
she seemed to feel, after a bare look at diggory venn, that the man had come on a strange errand, and that he was not so mean as she had thought him; for her close approach did not cause him to writhe uneasily, or shift his feet, or show any of those little signs which escape an ingenuous rustic at the advent of the uncommon in womankind. on his inquiring if he might have a conversation with her she replied, “yes, walk beside me,” and continued to move on.
before they had gone far it occurred to the perspicacious reddleman that he would have a

which might have carried weaker country lasses along with it had merely repelled eustacia. as a rule, the word budmouth meant fascination on egdon. that royal port and watering place, if truly mirrored in the minds of the heathfolk, must have combined, in a charming and indescribable manner a carthaginian bustle of building with tarentine luxuriousness and baian health and beauty. eustacia felt little less extravagantly about the place; but she would not sink her independence to get there.
when diggory venn had gone quite away, eustacia walked to the bank and looked down the wild and picturesque vale towards the sun, which was also in the direction of wildeve’s. the mist had now so far collapsed that the tips of the trees and bushes around his house could just be discerned, as if boring upwards through a vast white cobweb which cloaked them from the day. there was no doubt that her mind was inclined thitherward; indefinitely, fancifully—twining and untwining about him as the single object with

 good works, would be a result not dear at the price. but her thoughts soon strayed far from her own personality; and, full of a passionate and indescribable solicitude for one to whom she was not even a name, she went forth into the amplitude of tanned wild around her, restless as ahasuerus the jew. she was about half a mile from her residence when she beheld a sinister redness arising from a ravine a little way in advance—dull and lurid like a flame in sunlight and she guessed it to signify diggory venn.
when the farmers who had wished to buy in a new stock of reddle during the last month had inquired where venn was to be found, people replied, “on egdon heath.” day after day the answer was the same. now, since egdon was populated with heath-croppers and furze-cutters rather than with sheep and shepherds, and the downs where most of the latter were to be found lay some to the north, some to the west of egdon, his reason for camping about there like israel in zin was not apparent. the posit

letter was not the result of some momentary pique, to infer that she really gave him up to thomasin, would have required previous knowledge of her transfiguration by that man’s influence. who was to know that she had grown generous in the greediness of a new passion, that in coveting one cousin she was dealing liberally with another, that in her eagerness to appropriate she gave way?
full of this resolve to marry in haste, and wring the heart of the proud girl, wildeve went his way.
meanwhile diggory venn had returned to his van, where he stood looking thoughtfully into the stove. a new vista was opened up to him. but, however promising mrs. yeobright’s views of him might be as a candidate for her niece’s hand, one condition was indispensable to the favour of thomasin herself, and that was a renunciation of his present wild mode of life. in this he saw little difficulty.
he could not afford to wait till the next day before seeing thomasin and detailing his plan. he speedily plunged himself i

“well, he has beaten us,” her aunt said. “it really seems as if he had been playing with you in this way in revenge for my humbling him as i did by standing up against him at first.”
“o no, aunt,” murmured thomasin.
they said no more on the subject then. diggory venn’s knock came soon after; and mrs. yeobright, on returning from her interview with him in the porch, carelessly observed, “another lover has come to ask for you.”
“no?”
“yes, that queer young man venn.”
“asks to pay his addresses to me?”
“yes; and i told him he was too late.”
thomasin looked silently into the candle-flame. “poor diggory!” she said, and then aroused herself to other things.
the next day was passed in mere mechanical deeds of preparation, both the women b

“then i shall be soon enough to see them come out. i don’t quite like your keeping me in ignorance, mother, after all. really, i half hope he has failed to meet her!”
“and ruined her character?”
“nonsense—that wouldn’t ruin thomasin.”
he took up his hat and hastily left the house. mrs. yeobright looked rather unhappy, and sat still, deep in thought. but she was not long left alone. a few minutes later clym came back again, and in his company came diggory venn.
“i find there isn’t time for me to get there,” said clym.
“is she married?” mrs. yeobright inquired, turning to the reddleman a face in which a strange strife of wishes, for and against, was apparent.
venn bowed. “she is, ma’am.”
“how strange it sounds,” murmured clym.
“and he didn’t disappoint her this time?” said mrs. yeobright.
“he did not. and there is now no slight on her name. i was hastening ath’art to tell you at once, as i saw you were not there.”

pectful distance.
they performed the journey for the most part in silence, and drew near to throope corner, a few hundred yards from which a short path branched away to eustacia’s house. by degrees they discerned coming towards them a pair of human figures, apparently of the male sex.
when they came a little nearer eustacia broke the silence by saying, “one of those men is my husband. he promised to come to meet me.”
“and the other is my greatest enemy,” said wildeve.
“it looks like diggory venn.”
“that is the man.”
“it is an awkward meeting,” said she; “but such is my fortune. he knows too much about me, unless he could know more, and so prove to himself that what he now knows counts for nothing. well, let it be—you must deliver me up to them.”
“you will think twice before you direct me to do that. here is a man who has not forgotten an item in our meetings at rainbarrow—he is in company with your husband. which of them, seeing us together here, will believe that o

a beauty, with a white face and a mane as black as night.”
“ah!” said wildeve, fixing his eyes upon her; “who told you that?”
“venn the reddleman.”
the expression of wildeve’s face became curiously condensed. “that is a mistake—it must have been someone else,” he said slowly and testily, for he perceived that venn’s countermoves had begun again.




4—rough coercion is employed

those words of thomasin, which seemed so little, but meant so much, remained in the ears of diggory venn: “help me to keep him home in the evenings.”
on this occasion venn had arrived on egdon heath only to cross to the other side—he had no further connection with the interests of the yeobright family, and he had a business of his own to attend to. yet he suddenly began to feel himself drifting into the old track of manoeuvring on thomasin’s account.
he sat in his van and considered. from thomasin’s words and manner he had plainly gathered that wildeve neglected her. for whom could he ne

ss task of finding such a mere thread, she went straight on, trusting for guidance to her general knowledge of the contours, which was scarcely surpassed by clym’s or by that of the heath-croppers themselves.
at length thomasin reached a hollow and began to discern through the rain a faint blotted radiance, which presently assumed the oblong form of an open door. she knew that no house stood hereabouts, and was soon aware of the nature of the door by its height above the ground.
“why, it is diggory venn’s van, surely!” she said.
a certain secluded spot near rainbarrow was, she knew, often venn’s chosen centre when staying in this neighbourhood; and she guessed at once that she had stumbled upon this mysterious retreat. the question arose in her mind whether or not she should ask him to guide her into the path. in her anxiety to reach home she decided that she would appeal to him, notwithstanding the strangeness of appearing before his eyes at this place and season. but when, in pursuance

parlour window, which was as usual open. he was looking at the pot-flowers on the sill; they had been revived and restored by thomasin to the state in which his mother had left them. he heard a slight scream from thomasin, who was sitting inside the room.
“o, how you frightened me!” she said to someone who had entered. “i thought you were the ghost of yourself.”
clym was curious enough to advance a little further and look in at the window. to his astonishment there stood within the room diggory venn, no longer a reddleman, but exhibiting the strangely altered hues of an ordinary christian countenance, white shirt-front, light flowered waistcoat, blue-spotted neckerchief, and bottle-green coat. nothing in this appearance was at all singular but the fact of its great difference from what he had formerly been. red, and all approach to red, was carefully excluded from every article of clothes upon him; for what is there that persons just out of harness dread so much as reminders of the trade w

2—thomasin walks in a green place by the roman road

clym saw little of thomasin for several days after this; and when they met she was more silent than usual. at length he asked her what she was thinking of so intently.
“i am thoroughly perplexed,” she said candidly. “i cannot for my life think who it is that diggory venn is so much in love with. none of the girls at the maypole were good enough for him, and yet she must have been there.”
clym tried to imagine venn’s choice for a moment; but ceasing to be interested in the question he went on again with his gardening.
no clearing up of the mystery was granted her for some time. but one afternoon thomasin was upstairs getting ready for a walk, when she had occasion to come to the landing and call “rachel.” rachel was a girl about thirteen, who carried the

ucceeding days he saw her at different times from the window of his room moping disconsolately about the garden. he was half angry with her for choosing venn; then he was grieved at having put himself in the way of venn’s happiness, who was, after all, as honest and persevering a young fellow as any on egdon, since he had turned over a new leaf. in short, clym did not know what to do.
when next they met she said abruptly, “he is much more respectable now than he was then!”
“who? o yes—diggory venn.”
“aunt only objected because he was a reddleman.”
“well, thomasin, perhaps i don’t know all the particulars of my mother’s wish. so you had better use your own discretion.”
“you will always feel that i slighted your mother’s memory.”
“no, i will not. i shall think you are convinced that, had she seen diggory in his present position, she would have considered him a fitting husband for you. now, that’s my real feeling. don’t consult me any more, but do as you like, thom
