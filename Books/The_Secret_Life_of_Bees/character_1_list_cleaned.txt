and loving lady, skinnier than rosaleen but still larger-than-life
to lily. as a young woman, august attended school and worked as
a teacher, then she became a housekeeper in the home of deborah,
lily's mother, when deborah was a child. august created an alternate
religion for herself and her friends based around a statue of a
black mary that has been passed through generations of her family.
she teaches lily about this religion and spirituality in general,
as well as about beekeeping and love.
