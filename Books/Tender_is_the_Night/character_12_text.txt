made her hard—by not sparing her own labor and devotion
she had cultivated an idealism in rosemary, which at present
was directed toward herself and saw the world through
her eyes. so that while rosemary was a ‘simple’ child she
was protected by a double sheath of her mother’s armor and
her own—she had a mature distrust of the trivial, the facile
and the vulgar. however, with rosemary’s sudden success
in pictures mrs. speers felt that it was time she were spiritually
weaned; it would please rather than pain her if this
somewhat bouncing, breathless and exigent idealism would
focus on something except herself.
‘then you like it here?’ she asked.
‘it might be fun if we knew those people. there were some
other people, but they weren’t nice. they recognized me—
no matter where we go everybody’s seen ‘daddy’s girl.’’
mrs. speers waited for the glow of egotism to subside;
then she said in a matter-of-

there. but she did not want to see brady in the mood she
sensed he would be in after he had finished and she left the
lot with a spell still upon her. the mediterranean world was
less silent now that she knew the studio was there. she liked
the people on the streets and bought herself a pair of espadrilles
on the way to the train.
her mother was pleased that she had done so accurately
what she was told to do, but she still wanted to launch her
out and away. mrs. speers was fresh in appearance but she
was tired; death beds make people tired indeed and she had
watched beside a couple.

feeling good from the rosy wine at lunch, nicole diver
folded her arms high enough for the artificial camellia on
her shoulder to touch her cheek, and went out into her lovely
grassless garden. the garden was bounded on one side by
the house, from which it flowed and into which it ran, on
two sides by the old village, and on the last by the cliff falling

selves plain in an unaccustomed change of expression,
so the intensely calculated perfection of villa diana transpired
all at once through such minute failures as the chance
apparition of a maid in the background or the perversity of
a cork. while the first guests arrived bringing with them
the excitement of the night, the domestic activity of the day
receded past them gently, symbolized by the diver children
and their governess still at supper on the terrace.
‘what a beautiful garden!’ mrs. speers exclaimed.
‘nicole’s garden,’ said dick. ‘she won’t let it alone—she
nags it all the time, worries about its diseases. any day now
i expect to have her come down with powdery mildew or fly

rosemary, saying with a lightness seeming to conceal a paternal
interest, ‘i’m going to save your reason—i’m going to
give you a hat to wear on the beach.’
he turned them from the garden

ture quickly, with all the eventualities
that might lead up to a kiss, but with the kiss itself as
blurred as a kiss in pictures. she changed position in bed
deliberately, the first sign of insomnia she had ever had, and
tried to think with her mother’s mind about the question.
in this process she was often acute beyond her experience,
with remembered things from old conversations that had
gone into her half-heard.

rosemary had been brought up with the idea of work.
mrs. speers had spent the slim leavings of the men who
had widowed her on her daughter’s education, and when
she blossomed out at sixteen with that extraordinary hair,
rushed her to aix-les-bains and marched her unannounced
into the suite of an american producer who was recuperating
there. when the producer went to new york they went
too. thus rosemary had passed her entrance examinations.
with the ensuing success and the promise of comparative
stability that followed, mrs. speers had felt free to tacitl

 he demanded, with the air of having
seats. ‘i’ve hired the hotel car.’
‘i don’t want to go.’
‘why not? i imagine it’ll take years off my life but i
wouldn’t miss it for worlds. we could watch it from quite
far away.’
‘why don’t you get mr. dumphry to go with you?’
his monocle fell out, with no whiskers to hide in—he
drew himself up.
‘i never want to see him again.’
‘well, i’m afraid i can’t go. mother wouldn’t like it.’
as rosemary entered her room mrs. speers stirred sleepily
and called to her:
‘where’ve you been?’
‘i just couldn’t sleep. you go back to sleep, mother.’
‘come in my room.’ hearing her sit up in bed, rosemary
went in and told her what had happened.
‘why don’t you go and see it?’ mrs. speers suggested.
‘you needn’t go up close and you might be able to help af-

rosemary did not like the picture of herself looking on
and she demurred, but mrs. speer’s consciousness was still

nicole was a force—not necessarily well disposed or predictable
like her mother—an incalculable force. rosemary
was somewhat afraid of her.
at eleven she sat with dick and the norths at a houseboat
café just opened on the seine. the river shimmered
with lights from the bridges and cradled many cold moons.
on sundays sometimes when rosemary and her mother
had lived in paris they had taken the little steamer up to
suresnes and talked about plans for the future. they had little
money but mrs. speers was so sure of rosemary’s beauty
and had implanted in her so much ambition, that she was
willing to gamble the money on ‘advantages”; rosemary in
turn was to repay her mother when she got her start... .
since reaching paris abe north had had a thin vinous
fur over him; his eyes were bloodshot from sun and wine.
rosemary realized for the first time that he was always stopping
in places to get a drink, and she wondered how mary
north liked it. mary was quiet, so quiet save for her frequent

doctor richard diver and mrs. elsie speers sat in the
café des alliées in august, under cool and dusty trees. the
sparkle of the mica was dulled by the baked ground, and a
few gusts of mistral from down the coast seeped through the
esterel and rocked the fishing boats in the harbor, pointing
the masts here and there at a featureless sky.
‘i had a letter this morning,’ said mrs. speers. ‘what a
terrible time you all must have had with those negroes! but
rosemary said you were perfectly wonderful to her.’
‘rosemary ought to ha

another gust of wind strained around the porphyry hills
of la napoule. there was a hint in the air that the earth was
hurrying on toward other weather; the lush midsummer
moment outside of time was already over.
‘rosemary’s had crushes but sooner or later she always
turned the man over to me—‘ mrs. speers laughed, ‘—for
dissection.’
‘so i was spared.’
‘there was nothing i could have done. she was in love
with you before i ever saw you. i told her to go ahead.’
he saw that no provision had been made for him, or for
nicole, in mrs. speers’ plans—and he saw that her amorality

she had not even allowed for the possibility of rosemary’s
being damaged—or was she certain that she couldn’t be?

crossed the garden; and now the orchestra launching into
the nice carnival song, an echo of last year’s vanished gaieties,
started the little dance that went on all about her. in
a hundred hours she had come to possess all the world’s
dark magic; the blinding belladonna, the caffein converting
physical into nervous energy, the mandragora that imposes
harmony.
with an effort he once more accepted the fiction that he
shared mrs. speers’ detachment.
‘you and rosemary aren’t really alike,’ he said. ‘the wisdom
she got from you is all molded up into her persona,
into the mask she faces the world with. she doesn’t think;

her real depths are irish and romantic and illogical.’
mrs. speers knew too that rosemary, for all her delicate
surface, was a young mustang, perceptibly by captain doctor

saying good-by, dick was aware of elsie speers’ full
charm, aware that she meant rather more to him than merely
a last unwillingly relinquished fragment of rosemary. he
could possibly have made up rosemary—he could never
have made up her mother. if the cloak, spurs and brilliants
in which rosemary had walked off were things with which
he had endowed her, it was nice in contrast to watch her
mother’s grace knowing it was surely something he had not
evoked. she had an air of seeming to wait, as if for a man

he found nicole in the garden with her arms folded high
on her shoulders. she looked at him with straight gray eyes,
with a child’s searching wonder.
‘i went to cannes,’ he said. ‘i ran into mrs. speers. she’s
leaving to-morrow. she wanted to come up and say good-by
to you, but i slew the idea.’
‘i’m sorry. i’d like to have seen her. i like her.’
