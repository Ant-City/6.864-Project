[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER] is the only source of stability in the compson
household. she is the only character detached enough from the compsons'
downfall to witness both the beginning and the end of this final
chapter of the family history. interestingly, [CHARACTER] lives her life
based on the same set of fundamental values--family, faith, personal
honor, and so on--upon which the compsons' original greatness was
built. however, [CHARACTER] does not allow self-absorption to corrupt
her values or spirit. she is very patient and selfless--she cooks,
cleans, and takes care of the compson children in mrs. compson's
absence, while raising her own children and grandchildren at the
same time. [CHARACTER] seems to be the only person in the household truly
concerned for the compson children's welfare and character, and
she treats all of the children with love and fairness, even benjy.
the last chapter's focus on [CHARACTER] implies a hope for renewal after
the tragedies that have occurred. we sense that [CHARACTER] is the new
torchbearer of the compson legacy, and represents the only hope
for resurrecting the values of the old south in a pure and uncorrupted
form.
