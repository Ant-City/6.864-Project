     third scholar. no marvel though the angry greeks pursu'd
     with ten years' war the rape of such a queen,
     whose heavenly beauty passeth all compare.

     first scholar. since we have seen the pride of nature's works,
     and only paragon of excellence,
     let us depart; and for this glorious deed
     happy and blest be faustus evermore!

     faustus. gentlemen, farewell:  the same i wish to you.

     old man. ah, doctor faustus, that i might prevail
     to guide thy steps unto the way of life,
     by which sweet path thou mayst attain the goal
     that shall conduct thee to celestial rest!
     break heart, drop blood, and mingle it with tears,
     tears falling from repentant heaviness
     of thy most vile[155] and loathsome filthiness,
     the stench whereof corrupts the inward soul
     with such flagitious crimes of heinous sin[156]
     as no commiseration

     whose blood alone must wash away thy guilt.

     faustus. where art thou, faustus? wretch, what hast thou done?
     damn'd art thou, faustus, damn'd; despair and die!
     hell calls for right, and with a roaring voice
     says, "faustus, come; thine hour is almost[157] come;"
     and faustus now[158] will come to do thee right.
          [mephistophilis gives him a dagger.]

     old man. ah, stay, good faustus, stay thy desperate steps!
     i see an angel hovers o'er thy head,
     and, with a vial full of precious grace,
     offers to pour the same into thy soul:
     then call for mercy, and avoid despair.

     faustus. ah, my sweet friend, i feel
     thy words to comfort my distressed soul!
     leave me a while to ponder on my sins.

     old man. i go, sweet faustus; but with heavy cheer,
     fearing the ruin of thy hopeless soul.

us,
     and wear thy colours on my plumed crest;
     yea, i will wound achilles in the heel,
     and then return to helen for a kiss.
     o, thou art fairer than the evening air
     clad in the beauty of a thousand stars;
     brighter art thou than flaming jupiter
     when he appear'd to hapless semele;
     more lovely than the monarch of the sky
     in wanton arethusa's azur'd arms;

     that from thy soul exclud'st the grace of heaven,
     and fly'st the throne of his tribunal-seat!

          enter devils.

     satan begins to sift me with his pride:
     as in this furnace god shall try my faith,
     my faith, vile hell, shall triumph over thee.
     ambitious fiends, see how the heavens smile
     at your repulse, and laugh your state to scorn!
     hence, hell! for hence i fly unto my god.

     first scholar. what ails faustus?

     faustus. ah, my sweet chamber-fellow, had i lived with thee,
     then had i lived still! but now i die eternally.  look, comes
