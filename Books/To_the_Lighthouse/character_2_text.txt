glad to find; and that did not matter. but the sight of the girl standing
on the edge of the lawn painting reminded her; she was supposed to be
keeping her head as much in the same position as possible for lily's
picture. lily's picture! mrs. ramsay smiled. with her little chinese
eyes and her puckered-up face, she would never marry; one could not take
her painting very seriously; she was an independent little creature, and
mrs. ramsay liked her for it; so, remembering her promise, she

indeed, he almost knocked her easel over, coming down upon her with his
hands waving shouting out, "boldly we rode and well," but, mercifully, he
turned sharp, and rode off, to die gloriously she supposed upon the
heights of balaclava. never was anybody at once so ridiculous and so
alarming. but so long as he kept like that, waving, shouting, she was
safe; he would not stand still and look at her picture. and that was what
lily briscoe could not have endured. even while she looked at the mass,
at the line, at the colour, at mrs. ramsay sitting in the window with
james, she kept a feeler on her surroundings lest some one should creep
up, and suddenly she should find her picture looked at. but now, with all
her senses quickened as they were, looking, straining, till the colour of
the wall and the jacmanna beyond burnt into her eyes, she was aware of
someone coming out of the house, coming towards her; but somehow divined,

ction for ramsay had in no way diminished; but there, like
the body of a young man laid up in peat for a century, with the red fresh
on his lips, was his friendship, in its acuteness and reality, laid up
across the bay among the sandhills.

he was anxious for the sake of this friendship and perhaps too in order to
clear himself in his own mind from the imputation of having dried and
shrunk--for ramsay lived in a welter of children, whereas bankes was
childless and a widower--he was anxious that lily briscoe should not
disparage ramsay (a great man in his own way) yet should understand how
things stood between them. begun long years ago, their friendship had
petered out on a westmorland road, where the hen spread her wings before
her chicks; after which ramsay had married, and their paths lying
different ways, there had been, certainly for no one's fault, some
tendency, when they met, to repeat.

in what order they came, that was beyond him. he called them privately
after the kings and queens of england; cam the wicked, james the ruthless,
andrew the just, prue the fair--for prue would have beauty, he thought,
how could she help it?--and andrew brains. while he walked up the drive
and lily briscoe said yes and no and capped his comments (for she was in
love with them all, in love with this world) he weighed ramsay's case,
commiserated him, envied him, as if he had seen him divest himself of all
those glories of isolation and austerity which crowned him in youth to
cumber himself definitely with fluttering wings and clucking
domesticities. they gave him something--william bankes acknowledged that;

this lily briscoe think? could one help noticing that habits grew on him?
eccentricities, weaknesses perhaps? it was astonishing that a man of his
intellect could stoop so low as he did--but that was too harsh a
phrase--could depend so much as he did upon people's praise.

"oh, but," said lily, "think of his work!"

whenever she "thought of his work" she always saw clearly before her a

a moment what he knew to be inevitable, as if he impressed upon them his
own child-like resentment of interruption, yet even in the moment of
discovery was not to be routed utterly, but was determined to hold fast to
something of this delicious emotion, this impure rhapsody of which he was
ashamed, but in which he revelled--he turned abruptly, slammed his private
door on them; and, lily briscoe and mr. bankes, looking uneasily up into
the sky, observed that the flock of starlings which jasper had routed with
his gun had settled on the tops of the elm trees.

reached him from swansea, cardiff, exeter, southampton, kidderminster,

"talking nonsense," because, in effect, he had not done the thing he might

his own feelings, who could not say, this is what i like--this is what i
am; and rather pitiable and distasteful to william bankes and lily briscoe,
who wondered why such concealments should be necessary; why he needed
always praise; why so brave a man in thought should be so timid in life;
how strangely he was venerable and laughable at one and the same time.

yes, mr. bankes said, watching him go. it was a thousand pities. (lily
had said something about his frightening her--he changed from one mood to
another so suddenly.) yes, said mr. bankes, it was a thousand pities that
ramsay could not behave a little more like other people. (for he liked
lily briscoe; he could discuss ramsay with her quite openly.) it was for
that reason, he said, that the young don't read carlyle. a crusty old
grumbler who lost his temper if the porridge was cold, why should he
preach to us? was what mr. bankes understood that young people said
nowadays. it was a thousand pities if you thought, as he did, that
carlyle was one of the great teachers of mankind. lily was ashamed to say
that she had not read carlyle since she was at school. but in her opinion

was his narrowness, his blindness, she said, looking after him.

"a bit of a hypocrite?" mr. bankes suggested, looking too at mr. ramsay's
back, for was he not thinking of his friendship, and of cam refusing to
give him a flower, and of all those boys and girls, and his own house,
full of comfort, but, since his wife's death, quiet rather? of course,
he had his work... all the same, he rather wished lily to agree that
ramsay was, as he said, "a bit of a hypocrite."

lily briscoe went on putting away her brushes, looking up, looking down.
looking up, there he was--mr. ramsay--advancing towards them, swinging,
careless, oblivious, remote. a bit of a hypocrite? she repeated. oh,
no--the most sincere of men, the truest (here he was), the best; but,
looking down, she thought, he is absorbed in himself, he is tyrannical,
he is unjust; and kept looking down, purposely, for only so could she keep
steady, staying with the ramsays. directly one looked up and saw them,

certainty (and she was childlike now) that her dear lily, her little
brisk, was a fool. then, she remembered, she had laid her head on mrs.
ramsay's lap and laughed and laughed and laughed, laughed almost
hysterically at the thought of mrs. ramsay presiding with immutable calm
over destinies which she completely failed to understand. there she sat,
simple, serious. she had recovered her sense of her now--this was the
glove's twisted finger. but into what sanctuary had one penetrated?
lily briscoe had looked up at last, and there was mrs. ramsay, unwitting
entirely what had caused her laughter, still presiding, but now with every
trace of wilfulness abolished, and in its stead, something clear as the
space which the clouds at last uncover--the little space of sky which
sleeps beside the moon.

nick seemed to surround in a circle forever the paint-box, the lawn,
mr. bankes, and that wild villain, cam, dashing past.

his own, held out his hand; she would not stop for her father, whom she
grazed also by an inch; nor for her mother, who called "cam! i want

arrow, impelled by what desire, shot by whom, at what directed, who
could say? what, what? mrs. ramsay pondered, watching her. it might

her husband look at it; for the sight gave her such keen pleasure. but
she stopped herself. he never looked at things. if he did, all he
would say would be, poor little world, with one of his sighs.

at that moment, he said, "very fine," to please her, and pretended to
admire the flowers. but she knew quite well that he did not admire
them, or even realise that they were there. it was only to please
her. ah, but was that not lily briscoe strolling along with william

in bad health for many years, so that their sight-seeing had been on a
modest scale.

she had been to brussels; she had been to paris but only for a flying
visit to see an aunt who was ill. she had been to dresden; there were
masses of pictures she had not seen; however, lily briscoe reflected,
perhaps it was better not to see pictures: they only made one
hopelessly discontented with one's own work. mr. bankes thought one
could carry that point of view too far. we can't all be titians and we
can't all be darwins, he said; at the same time he doubted whether you
could have your darwin and your titian if it weren't for humble people
like ourselves. lily would have liked to pay him a compliment; you're

lodgings except for tonight; and in pity for him, life being now strong
enough to bear her on again, she began all this business, as a sailor
not without weariness sees the wind fill his sail and yet hardly wants
to be off again and thinks how, had the ship sunk, he would have
whirled round and round and found rest on the floor of the sea.

"did you find your letters? i told them to put them in the hall for
you," she said to william bankes.

lily briscoe watched her drifting into that strange no-man's land where
to follow people is impossible and yet their going inflicts such a
chill on those who watch them that they always try at least to follow
them with their eyes as one follows a fading ship until the sails have
sunk beneath the horizon.

how old she looks, how worn she looks, lily thought, and how remote.

had turned and the sun had struck its sails again, and lily thoug

nothing but talk, talk, talk, eat, eat, eat. it was the women's fault.
women made civilisation impossible with all their "charm," all their
silliness.

"no going to the lighthouse tomorrow, mrs. ramsay," he said, asserting
himself. he liked her; he admired her; he still thought of the man in
the drain-pipe looking up at her; but he felt it necessary to assert
himself.

he was really, lily briscoe thought, in spite of his eyes, but then
look at his nose, look at his hands, the most uncharming human being
she had ever met. then why did she mind what he said? women can't
write, women can't paint--what did that matter coming from him, since
clearly it was not true to him but for some reason helpful to him, and
that was why he said it? why did her whole being bow, like corn under
a wind, and erect itself again from this abasement only with a great
and rather painful effort? she must make it

it was all in scraps and fragments. he felt extremely, even
physically, uncomfortable. he wanted somebody to give him a chance of
asserting himself. he wanted it so urgently that he fidgeted in his
chair, looked at this person, then at that person, tried to break into
their talk, opened his mouth and shut it again. they were talking
about the fishing industry. why did no one ask him his opinion? what
did they know about the fishing industry?

lily briscoe knew all that. sitting opposite him, could she not see,
as in an x-ray photograph, the ribs and thigh bones of the young man's
desire to impress himself, lying dark in the mist of his flesh--that
thin mist which convention had laid over his burning desire to break
into the conversation? but, she thought, screwing up her chinese
eyes, and remembering how he sneered at women, "can't paint, can't
write," why should i help him to relieve himself?

the glance in her eyes said it, of course for the hundred and fiftieth
time lily briscoe had to renounce the experiment--what happens if one
is not nice to that young man there--and be nice.

judging the turn in her mood correctly--that she was friendly to him
now--he was relieved of his egotism, and told her how he had been
thrown out of a boat when he was a baby; how his father used to fish
him out with a boat-hook; that was how he had learnt to swim. one of
his uncles kept the light on some rock or other off the scottish coast,
he said. he had been there with him in a storm. thi

herself), ah, she thought, but what haven't i paid to get it for you?
she had not been sincere.

she had done the usual trick--been nice. she would never know him. he

knew that by the way mr. ramsay told her not to be a fool. she sat
beside him, smiling.

it must have happened then, thought mrs. ramsay; they are engaged. and
for a moment she felt what she had never expected to feel again--
jealousy. for he, her husband, felt it too--minta's glow; he liked
these girls, these golden-reddish girls, with something flying,
something a little wild and harum-scarum about them, who didn't
"scrape their hair off," weren't, as he said about poor lily briscoe,
"skimpy". there was some quality which she herself had not, some
lustre, some richness, which attracted him, amused him, led him to make
favourites of girls like minta. they might cut his hair from him,
plait him watch-chains, or interrupt him at his work, hailing him (she
heard them), "come along, mr. ramsay; it's our turn to beat them now,"
and out he came to play tennis.

but indeed she was not jealous, only, now and then, when she made
herself look in her glass, a little resentful that she

the wind settled; loosely the world shook itself down to sleep, darkly
here without a light to it, save what came green suffused through
leaves, or pale on the white flowers in the bed by the window.

then indeed peace had come. messages of peace breathed from the sea to
the shore. never to break its sleep any more, to lull it rather more
deeply to rest, and whatever the dreamers dreamt holily, dreamt wisely,

the night wrapped them; nothing broke their sleep, until, the birds

her to go to the kitchen to fetch another cup of coffee or wait here.

talk of her marrying william bankes once, but nothing had come of it.
his wife had been fond of her. he had been a little out of temper too
at breakfast. and then, and then--this was one of those moments when
an enormous need urged him, without being conscious what it was, to
approach any woman, to force them, he did not care how, his need was so
great, to give him what he wanted: sympathy.

was anybody looking after her? he said. had she everything she
wanted?

"oh, thanks, everything," said lily briscoe nervously. no; she could
not do it. she ought to have floated off instantly upon some wave of
sympathetic expansion: the pressure on her was tremendous. but she
remained stuck. there was an awful pause. they both looked at the
sea. why, thought mr. ramsay, should she look at the sea when i am
here? she hoped it would be calm enough for them to land at the
lighthouse, she said. the lighthouse! the lighthouse! what's that
got to do with it? he thought impatiently. instantly, with the force

raised bitter storms, so that even now she woke in the night trembling
with rage and remembered some command of his; some insolence: "do
this," "do that," his dominance: his "submit to me."

so she said nothing, but looked doggedly and sadly at the shore,
wrapped in its mantle of peace; as if the people there had fallen
asleep, she thought; were free like smoke, were free to come and go
like ghosts. they have no suffering there, she thought.

yes, that is their boat, lily briscoe decided, standing on the edge of
the lawn. it was the boat with greyish-brown sails, which she saw now
flatten itself upon the water and shoot off across the bay. there he
sits, she thought, and the children are quite silent still. and she
could not reach him either. the sympathy she had not given him weighed
her down. it made it difficult for her to paint.

she had always found him difficult. she never had been able to praise
him to his face, she remembered. and that reduced their relationship

him the annihilation of womanhood, and dirt and disorder, and servants

she collected her impressions of the rayleys. their lives appeared to
her in a series of scenes; one, on the staircase at dawn. paul had
come in and gone to bed early; minta was late. there was minta,
wreathed, tinted, garish on the stairs about three o'clock in the
morning. paul came out in his pyjamas carrying a poker in case of
burglars. minta was eating a sandwich, standing half-way up by a

woke and shot through the waves. the relief was extraordinary. they
all seemed to fall away from each other again and to be at their
ease, and the fishing-lines slanted taut across the side of the
boat. but his father did not rouse himself. he only raised his right
hand mysteriously high in the air, and let it fall upon his knee again
as if he were conducting some secret symphony.

in it, she felt, they were gone for ever, they had become part of the
nature of things. it was so calm; it was so quiet. the steamer itself
had vanished, but the great scroll of smoke still hung in the air and
drooped like a flag mournfully in valediction.]

she gazed back over the sea, at the island. but the leaf was losing
its sharpness. it was very small; it was very distant. the sea was
more important now than the shore. waves were all round them, tossing
and sinking, with a log wallowing down one wave; a gull riding on
another. about here, she thought, dabbling her fingers in the water, a
ship had sunk, and she murmured, dreamily half asleep, how we perished,
each alone.

had scarcely a stain on it, which was so soft that the sails and the
clouds seemed set in its blue, so much depends, she thought, upon
distance: whether people are near us or far from us; for her feeling
for mr. ramsay changed as he sailed further and further across the bay.
it seemed to be elongated, stretched out; he seemed to become more and
more remote. he and his children seemed to be swallowed up in that
blue, that distance; but here, on the lawn, close at hand,

ng those parcels," he said, nodding his head at the things nancy
had done up for them to take to the lighthouse. "the parcels for the
lighthouse men," he said. he rose and stood in the bow of the boat,
very straight and tall, for all the world, james thought, as if he were
saying, "there is no god," and cam thought, as if he were leaping into
space, and they both rose to follow him as he sprang, lightly like a
young man, holding his parcel, on to the rock.

"he must have reached it," said lily briscoe aloud, feeling suddenly
completely tired out. for the lighthouse had become almost invisible,
had melted away into a blue haze, and the effort of looking at it and
the effort of thinking of him landing there, which both seemed to be
one and the same effort, had stretched her body and mind to the utmost.
ah, but she was relieved. whatever she had wanted to give him, when he
left her that morning, she had given him at last.

"he has landed," she said aloud. "it is finished." then, surging up,
