tone. ‘nobody seems to like her, down here, and i’m sure she’s the best
cat in the world! oh, my dear dinah! i wonder if i shall ever see you
any more!’ and here poor alice began to cry again, for she felt very
lonely and low-spirited. in a little while, however, she again heard
a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
eagerly, half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind, and was coming
back to finish his story.




chapter iv. the rabbit sends in a little bill

it was the white rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
it muttering to itself ‘the duchess! the duchess! oh my dear paws! oh
my fur and whiskers! she’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets! where can i have dropped them, i wonder?’ alice guessed in a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,
and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were

e sounds of broken glass. ‘what a number of
cucumber-frames there must be!’ thought alice. ‘i wonder what they’ll do
next! as for pulling me out of the window, i only wish they could! i’m
sure i don’t want to stay in here any longer!’

she waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices
all talking together: she made out the words: ‘where’s the other
ladder?--why, i hadn’t to bring but one; bill’s got the other--bill!
fetch it here, lad!--here, put ‘em up at this corner--no, tie ‘em
together first--they don’t reach half high enough yet--oh! they’ll
do well enough; don’t be particular--here, bill! catch hold of this
rope--will the roof bear?--mind that loose slate--oh, it’s coming
down! heads below!’ (a loud crash)--‘now, who did that?--it was bill, i
fancy--who’s to go down the chimney?--nay, i shan’t! you do it!--that i
won’t, then!--bill’s to go down--here,

bill! the master says you’re to
go down the chimney!’

‘oh! so bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?’ said alice to
herself. ‘shy, they seem to put everything upon bill! i wouldn’t be in
bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
i think i can kick a little!’

she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited
till she heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
saying to herself ‘this is bill,’ she gave one sharp kick, and waited to
see what would happen next.

the first thing she heard was a general chorus of ‘there goes bill!’

e rabbit’s voice along--‘catch him, you by the hedge!’ then
silence, and then another confusion of voices--‘hold up his head--brandy
now--don’t choke him--how was it, old fellow? what happened to you? tell
us all about it!’

last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, [‘that’s bill,’ thought
alice,) ‘well, i hardly know--no more, thank ye; i’m better now--but i’m
a deal too flustered to tell you--all i know is, something comes at me
like a jack-in-the-box, and up i goes like a sky-rocket!’

‘so you did, old fellow!’ said the others.

‘we must burn the house down!’ said the rabbit’s voice; and alice called
out as loud as she could, ‘if you do. i’ll set dinah at you!’

there was a dead silence instantly, and alice thought to herself, ‘i

 the floor, and a bright idea came into her
head. ‘if i eat one of these cakes,’ she thought, ‘it’s sure to make
some change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it must
make me smaller, i suppose.’

so she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly. as soon as she was small enough to get through
the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little
animals and birds waiting outside. the poor little lizard, bill, was
in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
something out of a bottle. they all made a rush at alice the moment she
appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
safe in a thick wood.

‘the first thing i’ve got to do,’ said alice to herself, as she wandered
about in the wood, ‘is to grow to my right size again; and the second
thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. i think that will be
the best plan.’

ations--in fact, we went to school every day--’

‘i’ve been to a day-school, too,’ said alice; ‘you needn’t be so proud
as all that.’

‘with extras?’ asked the mock turtle a little anxiously.

‘yes,’ said alice, ‘we learned french and music.’

‘and washing?’ said the mock turtle.

‘certainly not!’ said alice indignantly.

‘ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,’ said the mock turtle in
a tone of great relief. ‘now at ours they had at the end of the bill,
“french, music, and washing--extra.”’

‘you couldn’t have wanted it much,’ said alice; ‘living at the bottom of
the sea.’

‘i couldn’t afford to learn it.’ said the mock turtle with a sigh. ‘i
only took the regular course.’

‘what was that?’ inquired alice.

‘reeling and writhing, of course, to begin with,’ the mock turtle
replied; ‘and then the different branches of arithmetic--ambition,
distraction, uglification, and derision.’

‘i never heard of “ug

pid things!’ on their slates,
and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell
‘stupid,’ and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. ‘a nice
muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!’ thought alice.

one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. this of course, alice
could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. she did it so quickly
that the poor little juror (it was bill, the lizard) could not make out
at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was
obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was
of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.

‘herald, read the accusation!’ said the king.

on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--

   ‘the queen of hearts, she made some tarts,

e him two--” why, that must be what he
did with the tarts, you know--’

‘but, it goes on “they all returned from him to you,”’ said alice.

‘why, there they are!’ said the king triumphantly, pointing to the tarts
on the table. ‘nothing can be clearer than that. then again--“before she
had this fit--” you never had fits, my dear, i think?’ he said to the
queen.

‘never!’ said the queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the lizard
as she spoke. (the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his
slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as
it lasted.)

‘then the words don’t fit you,’ said the king, looking round the court
with a smile. there was a dead silence.

‘it’s a pun!’ the king added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,
‘let the jury consider their verdict,’ the king said, for about the
twentieth time that day.

‘no, no!’ said
