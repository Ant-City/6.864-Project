 that this old man had a hat not a hood. still i do not doubt that you guess right, and that we are in peril here, by night or day. yet in the meantime there is nothing that we can do but rest, while we may. i will watch for a while now, gimli. i have more need of thought than of sleep.'
the night passed slowly. legolas followed aragorn, and gimli followed legolas, and their watches wore away. but nothing happened. the old man did not appear again, and the horses did not return.

chapter 3

the uruk-hai

pippin lay in a dark and troubled dream: it seemed that he could hear his own small voice echoing in black tunnels, calling frodo, frodo! but instead of frodo hundreds of hideous orc-faces grinned at him out of the shadows, hundreds of hideous arms grasped at him from every side. where was merry?
he woke. cold air blew on his face. he was lying on his back. evening was coming and the sky above was growing dim. he turned and found that the dream was little worse than the waking. his wrists, leg

 evil voice. 'a winged nazgûl awaits us northward on the east-bank.'
'maybe, maybe! then you'll fly off with our prisoners, and get all the pay and praise in lugbúrz, and leave us to foot it as best we can through the horse-country. no, we must stick together. these lands are dangerous: full of foul rebels and brigands.'
'aye, we must stick together,' growled uglúk. 'i don't trust you little swine. you've no guts outside your own sties. but for us you'd all have run away. we are the fighting uruk-hai! we slew the great warrior. we took the prisoners. we are the servants of saruman the wise, the white hand: the hand that gives us man's-flesh to eat. we came out of isengard, and led you here, and we shall lead you back by the way we choose. i am uglúk. i have spoken.'
'you have spoken more than enough, uglúk,' sneered the evil voice. 'i wonder how they would like it in lugbúrz. they might think that uglúk's shoulders needed relieving of a swollen head. they might ask where his strange ide

ys of the sun. a dark smudge of forest lay on the lower slopes before them.
there was much shouting and debating among the orcs; a quarrel seemed on the point of breaking out again between the northerners and the isengarders. some were pointing back away south, and some were pointing eastward.
'very well,' said uglúk. 'leave them to me then! no killing, as i've told you before; but if you want to throw away what we've come all the way to get, throw it away! i'll look after it. let the fighting uruk-hai do the work, as usual. if you're afraid of the whiteskins, run! run! there's the forest,' he shouted, pointing ahead. 'get to it! it's your best hope. off you go! and quick, before i knock a few more heads off, to put some sense into the others.'
there was some cursing and scuffling, and then most of the northerners broke away and dashed off, over a hundred of them, running wildly along the river towards the mountains. the hobbits were left with the isengarders: a grim dark band, four score at

úk,' he said. 'nazgûl! ah! all that they make out! one day you'll wish that you had not said that. ape!' he snarled fiercely. 'you ought to know that they're the apple of the great eye. but the winged nazgûl: not yet, not yet. he won't let them show themselves across the great river yet, not too soon. they're for the war-and other purposes.'
'you seem to know a lot,' said uglúk. 'more than is good for you, i guess. perhaps those in lugbúrz might wonder how, and why. but in the meantime the uruk-hai of isengard can do the dirty work, as usual. don't stand slavering there! get your rabble together! the other swine are legging it to the forest. you'd better follow. you wouldn't get back to the great river alive. right off the mark! now! i'll be on your heels.'
the isengarders seized merry and pippin again and slung them on their backs. then the troop started off. hour after hour they ran, pausing now and again only to sling the hobbits to fresh carriers. either because they were quicker and

ones. grappling-hooks were hurled, and ladders raised. again and again the orcs gained the summit of the outer wall, and again the defenders cast them down.
at last aragorn stood above the great gates, heedless of the darts of the enemy. as he looked forth he saw the eastern sky grow pale. then he raised his empty hand, palm outward in token of parley.
the orcs yelled and jeered. 'come down! come down!' they cried. 'if you wish to speak to us, come down! bring out your king! we are the fighting uruk-hai. we will fetch him from his hole, if he does not come. bring out your skulking king!'
'the king stays or comes at his own will,' said aragorn.
'then what are you doing here?' they answered. 'why do you look out? do you wish to see the greatness of our army? we are the fighting uruk-hai.'
'i looked out to see the dawn,' said aragorn.
'what of the dawn?' they jeered. 'we are the uruk-hai: we do not stop the fight for night or day, for fair weather or for storm. we come to kill, by sun or moon. wh
