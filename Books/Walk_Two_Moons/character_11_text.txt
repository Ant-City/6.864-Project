   when we left, phoebe whispered, 'i wish you hadn't done that. i wish you
hadn't told her i lived next door.

   'why not? you don't seem to know mrs. cadaver and mrs. partridge very
well--'

   'they haven't lived there very long. only a month or so.'

   'don't you think it's remarkable that she guessed your age like that?'

   'i don't see what is so remarkable about it,' phoebe said. before i could
explain, she started telling me about the time that she and her mother, father
and sister prudence, had gone to the state fair. they went to a booth where
a crowd was gathered around a tall, thin man.

   'so, what was he doing?' i asked.


   'that's what i'm telling you,' phoebe said. phoebe had a way of sounding
like a grown-up sometimes. when she said, 'that's what i'm telling you,' she
sounded like a grown-up talking to a child. 'all around, people were saying,
"oh!" and "amazing!" and "how does he do that?" what he was doing was
guessing people's ages he had to guess your correct age

   'what was the diabolic thing that happened to mr. cadaver?' gramps
asked. 'you didn't tell us that yet.'

   i explained that just as phoebe was going to divulge the purely awful thing
that had happened to mr. cadaver, her father came home from work and we
all sat down to dinner: me, phoebe, mr. and mrs. winterbottom, and
phoebe's sister, prudence.

   phoebe's parents reminded me a lot of my other grandparents - the
pickfords like the pickfords, mr. and mrs. winterbottom spoke quietly, in
short sentences, and sat straight up as they ate their food. they were
extremely polite to each other, saying 'yes, norma,' and 'yes, george,' and
'would you please pass the potatoes, phoebe?' and 'wouldn't your guest like
another helping?'

   they were picky about their food, too. everything they ate was what my
father would call 'side dishes': potat

pies she had been busy making, she gave a soft sigh and looked down at her
plate.

   a little later, she said, 'i couldn't find exactly that brand of muesli you like
so much, george, but i bought something similar.

   'oh?' mr. winterbottom said.

   'i'm sure it's quite similar to what you wanted.'

   mr. winterbottom kept eating and again, in that silence, mrs.
winterbottom gave a soft sigh and examined her plate.

   i was sort of happy for her when she announced that since phoebe and
prudence were back in school, she thought she would return to work.
apparently, during the school terms she worked part-time at rocky's rubber
as a receptionist. i thought this might be a nice change for her, to be out of
the house, but when she mentioned going back to work and no one said any-
thing about it, she sighed again and pushed her potatoes to one side of her
plate.

   a few times, mrs. winterbottom called her husband, 'sweetie pie' and
'honey bun'. she said, 'would you like more courgettes,

interbottom was playing the
role of a father, with a capital 'f'. he sat at the head of the table with his

white shirt cuffs rolled back neatly. he still wore his red and blue striped tie.
he kept his face very serious throughout the entire meal. his voice was
deep, and his words were clear. 'yes, norma,' he said, deeply and clearly.
'no, norma.' he looked more like fifty-two than thirty- eight, but this was
not something i would ever call to his - or phoebe's - attention.

   phoebe's sister prudence was quite a bit like her mother. prudence was
seventeen years old, but she acted like she was almost a mother herself. she
ate primly, she nodded politely, she smiled a small, polite smile after
everything she said.

   it all seemed peculiar. they acted so thumpingly tidy and respectable.

   at the end of the dinner, mrs. winterbottom brought in the blackberry pie.
i ate it, even though the black- berries did not have as much flavour as they
did in bybanks, kentucky. mr. winterbottom asked ph

he acted and how phoebe acted, on and on. at last, mrs. winterbottom said,
'i think we had better not mention this to your father.' she reached forward
as if to hug phoebe, but phoebe pulled away.

   later, phoebe said, 'that's odd. usually my mother tells my father
absolutely everything, and i mean every- thing, including what the man at
the grocery store said and how much bread costs and where you can buy a
cheaper loaf of bread and what sort of silver polish is better than another and
what prudence said and what i said and all that.'


   'maybe she thinks your father would be angry about your talking with a
stranger,' i said. 'maybe she's just trying to save you from getting into
trouble.'

   'i still don't like keeping it secret from him,' phoebe said.

   we walked out onto her porch and there, lying on the top step, was a white
envelope. there was no name or anything on the outside. i thought it was
one of those advertisements for painting your house or cleaning your
carpets. phoebe

 picked it up and opened it. 'gosh,' she said. inside was a
small piece of blue paper and on it was printed this message: don't judge a
man until you've walked two moons in his moccasins.

   'what an odd thing,' phoebe said.

   i looked at the paper. at first, i had the funny sensation that it was from
my father, because he is always saying things like this he is a regular book
of proverbs. but the handwriting was not at all like my father's.

   phoebe showed the message to her sister prudence and her mother. mrs.
winterbottom clutched at her collar. 'who could it be for?' she asked.

   mr. winterbottom came in the back door, carrying his golf clubs. mrs.
winterbottom showed him the message. 'who could it be for?' mrs.
winterbottom repeated.

   'i couldn't say, really,' mr. winterbottom said.

   'but, george, why would someone send us that message?'

   'i couldn't say, norma. maybe it isn't for us.' mr. winterbottom set his golf
clubs down beside the refrigerator. he did not seem

message.

   prudence said, 'it's not for me.'

   'but, how do you know that?' mrs. winterbottom said.

   'i just know it,' prudence said.

   'phoebe?' mrs. winterbottom asked. 'is it for you?'

   'for me?' phoebe said, 'i don't think so,

   'well. who is it for?' mrs. winterbottom said.

   prudence looked at her father who looked phoebe, who looked at me and i

   mrs. winterbottom looked extensively worried. i believe she thought it

believed that one day we might build a raft and float away down a river
together. but when she went to lewiston, idaho, she went alone.

   ben touched phoebe's arm. she flinched. 'ha,' he said. 'gotcha. you're
jumpy, too, free bee.'

   and that surprised me. i had already noticed how tense phoebe's whole
family seemed, how tidy, how respectable, and how thumpingly stiff. was i
becoming like that? why were they like that? a couple of times i had seen
phoebe's mother try to touch phoebe or prudence or mr. winterbottom, but
they all drew back from her. it was as if they had outgrown her.

   had i been drawing away from my own mother? did she have empty
spaces left over? was that why she left?


   when we reached phoebe's driveway. ben said, 'i guess you're safe now. i
guess i'll go.

   'go ahead.' phoebe said.

   we stood there. he stood there. mrs. cadaver came screeching up to the
kerb in her yellow volkswagen, with her wild red witch hair flying all over
the place. she waved at us

n't want to notice. maybe
it was too frightening a thing. i started wondering if this was how it had been
with my mother. were there things i didn't notice?

   phoebe sat quite straight in her chair and said, 'sal. i can assure you that
my mother would not be afraid to say if something is bothering her. what on
earth would she have to be afraid of? we are not exactly a family of lunatics,
you know.'

   later that afternoon, when phoebe and i went downstairs, mrs.
winterbottom was talking with prudence. 'do you think i lead a tiny life?'
she was asking.


   'how do you mean?' prudence asked, as she filed her nails. 'do we have
any nail polish remover?'

   phoebe's mother retrieved a bottle of nail polish remover from the
bathroom. 'what i was wondering,' phoebe's mother said, 'was if you think--'
she stopped talking when she saw me and phoebe.

   'oh!' prudence said to her mother. 'before i forget - do you think you
could sew up the hem on my brown skirt so i could wear it tomorrow? oh,

lease?' prudence tilted her head to the side and tugged at her hair in exactly
the same way phoebe does. prudence smooshed up her mouth into a little
pout.

   in the kitchen, i said to phoebe, 'doesn't prudence know how to sew?'

   'of course, she does' phoebe said. 'why do you ask?'

   'i was just wondering why she doesn't sew her own skirt.'

   'sal,' phoebe said, 'if you don't mind my saying so, i think you're becoming
ever so critical.'

   before i left phoebe's that day, mrs. winterbottom handed prudence her
brown skirt with the newly sewn hem, and all the way home i wondered
about mrs. winterbottom and what she meant about living a tiny life. if she
didn't like all that baking and cleaning a

ast day home. several times
that day, my mother asked me if i wanted to walk up in the fields with her. it
was drizzling outside, and i was cleaning out my desk, and i just did not feel
like going. 'maybe later,' i kept saying. when she asked me for about the
tenth time, i said, 'no! i don't want to go. why do you keep asking me?' i
don't know why i did that. i didn't mean anything by it, but that was one of
the last memories she had of me, and i wished i could take it back.

   phoebe's sister prudence breezed into the house, slamming the door behind
her. 'i just blew it, i know it!' she wailed.

   'oh, sweetie,' her mother said.

   'i did!' prudence said. 'i did, i did, i did.'

   'prudence, your father does not like you to use that phrase "blew it".

   'why not?' prudence asked.

   mrs. winterbottom looked tired and sad. 'oh, i don't know,' she said. 'i
suppose he thinks it doesn't sound - very respectable.' mrs. winterbottom
half-heartedly chipped away at the burned brownies and asked

 prudence if
she would have another chance at cheerleading try-outs.

   'yes, tomorrow. but i know i'm going to blow--'

   her mother said, 'maybe i'll come along and watch.' i could tell that mrs.
winterbottom was trying to rise above some awful sadness she was feeling,
but prudence couldn't see that. prudence had her own agenda, just as i had
had my own agenda that day my mother wanted me to walk with her. i
couldn't see my own mother's sadness.

   'what?' prudence said. 'come along and watch?'

   'yes, wouldn't that be nice?'

   'no!' prudence said. 'no. no, no. you can't. it would be awful.'


   'awful?' mrs. winterbottom said.

   'awful, awful, awful.'

   as i was wondering why she didn't tell prudence to jump in the lake, mrs.
winterbottom burst into tears and left the table. prudence glowered at me
and stomped out of the kitchen. i sat there looking around at the walls. i
heard the front door open and shut and i heard phoebe call my name. she

she said.

   mrs. winterbottom reappeared and took the envelope. 'have you opened
it?' she asked phoebe.

   'not yet.'

   'i'll open it,' her mother said. she turned the envelope over and over before
she slowly unsealed it and slipped out the message. she held it close to her
so that we couldn't see.

   'well?' phoebe demanded.

   'oh,' mrs. winterbottom said. 'who is doing this?' she held out the piece
of paper. on it was written:

   in the course of a lifetime, what does it matter? prudence joined us 'what
the heck does that mean?' she asked.

   her mother said. 'where are these coming from?'

   'i honestly couldn't say,' phoebe said.

   prudence flopped down on the sofa. 'well, i have more important things to
worry about, i can assure you. i know i'm going to blow those cheerleading
try- outs i just know it.'

   on and on she went, until phoebe said, 'gripes, prudence, in the course of
a lifetime, what does it matter?'


   at that moment, it was as if a click went off in mr

she put her hand to her mouth and stared out the window. she was invisible
to prudence and phoebe, though. they did not notice.

   prudence said, 'what is that supposed to mean?'

   phoebe said, 'i was just thinking. are these try-outs such a big deal? will
you even remember them in five years?'

   'yes!' prudence said. 'yes, i most certainly will.'

   'how about ten years? will you remember them in ten?'

   'yes!' prudence said.

   as i walked home, i thought about the message. in the course of a lifetime,
what does it matter? i said it over and over. it seemed odd that phoebe found
a way to use that saying right after it arrived. i wondered about the
mysterious messenger, and i wondered about all the things in the course of a
lifetime that would not matter. i did not think cheerleading try-outs would
matter, nor shoes that were too tight. i wondered if yelling at your mother
would matter. i was not sure about t

kissed my ear. i was not sure this was what he intended. in fact, i was not
sure it happened at all because, before i knew it, he had hopped down the
steps and was walking away.

   the door inched open and there was phoebe's round face, as white and
frightened as ever you could imagine. 'quick,' she said. 'come in.' she led
me into the kitchen. on the kitchen table was an apple pie, and beside it
were three envelopes: one for phoebe, one for prudence, and one for their
father.

   'i opened my note,' phoebe said, showing it to me. it said, keep all the
doors locked and call your father if you need anything.  i love you, phoebe.
it was signed, mom.

   i didn't think too much of it. 'phoebe--' i said.

   'i know, i know. it doesn't sound terrible or anything. in fact, my first
thought was. 'well good. she knows i am old enough to be here by myself."
i figured she was out shopping or maybe she even decided to return to work,
even though she

   phoebe showed me the note left for prudence. it said, please hear up the
spaghetti sauce and boil the spaghetti. i love you, prudence. it was signed,
mom.

   i still, didn't think too much of it. 'she's probably just working late,' i said.

   'i don't know,' phoebe said. 'i don't like it. i don't like it one bit.'

   prudence heated up the spaghetti sauce and boiled the spaghetti, while i
helped phoebe set the table. phoebe and i even made a salad. 'i do feel sort
of independent,' phoebe said.

   phoebe's father came home. 'where's norma?' he said. phoebe showed him
his note. he opened it and sat down, staring at the piece of paper. phoebe
looked over his shoulder and read his note aloud: i had to go away. i can't
explain. i'll call you in a few days. it was signed, norma.

   i had a sinking, sinking feeling.

prudence started asking a million questions. 'what does she mean? go

   'the police? what for?' mr. winterbottom said.

   'phoebe, if she was kidnapped, would the lunatic - as you say - allow he; to
sit down and write these notes? mm?'

   'he might--

   'phoebe! that's enough.' he sat there staring at the note. then he stood up,
removed his coat, took off his tie and said, 'let's eat.' it was only then that he
seemed to notice i was there. 'oh,' he said. he looked quite embarrassed. 'i'm

   'phoebe, i know you're worried, but there's nothing we can do. we have to
get on with things we can't malinger.

   'we can't what?' phoebe said.

   'malinger. here. look it up.' he tossed her the dictionary from her desk
and tore down the hall.

   'my mother is missing, and my father hands me: a dictionary.' phoebe said.
she looked up 'malinger and read the definition: 'to pretend to be ill in order
to escape duty or work.' she slammed the book shut. 'i am not malingering.'


   prudence was running around in a frenzy. 'where is my white blouse?
phoebe, have you seen...? i could have sworn...!· she was pulling things out
of her closet and flinging them on the bed.

   phoebe reluctantly got dressed, pulling a wrinkled blouse and skirt from
the closet. downstairs, the kitchen table was bare. 'no bowls of muesli,'
phoebe said. 'no glasses of orange juice or whole wheat toast.' she touched
a white sweater hanging on the back of a chair. 'my mother's favourite white
cardigan,' she

ing who she really was, or thinking she was someone else. my
father would say, 'she does not have cancer, sal. she does not have amnesia.
'those are fishes in the air.' but i didn't believe him. maybe he was trying to
protect her - or me.

   phoebe prowled through the house, examining the walls and carpet,
searching for blood stains she found several suspicious spots and
unidentifiable hair strands phoebe marked the spots with pieces of adhesive
tape and collected the hairs in an envelope.

   prudence was in a lather when she came home. 'i made it!' she said. 'i
made it!' she was jumping all about. 'i made cheerleading!' when phoebe
reminded her that their mother had been kidnapped. prudence said,  'oh,
phoebe.  mom wasn't kidnapped.'  she stopped jumping and looked around
the kitchen. 'so, what are we supposed to have for dinner?'

   phoebe rummaged around in the cupboards. prudence opened the freezer
compartment and said, 'look at this.' for a terrible moment, i thought

perhaps she had

found some chopped-up body parts in there. maybe, just
maybe. phoebe was right. maybe a lunatic had done away with her mother. i
couldn't look. i could hear prudence moving things about in the freezer. at
least she wasn't screaming.

   there were no body parts in the freezer. instead, stacked neatly, were
plastic containers each with a little note attached. 'broc-len gas, 350, 1 hr,'
prudence read, and 'veg spa& 325, 30 min.' and 'mac che, 325, 45 min,' on
and on and on.

   'what's broc-len cas?' 1 said.

   phoebe pried open the lid. inside was a green and yellow hardened mass.
'broccoli and lentil casserole,' she said.

   when their father came home, he seemed surprised to see dinner on the
table. prudence showed him the freezer contents. 'hm,' he said. at dinner,
we all ate rather quietly.

   'i  don't suppose you've  heard  anything - from mom?' prudence asked her
father.

 'not yet,' he said.

   'i think we should call the police,' phoebe said. 'phoebe.

   'i'm serious. i found some suspicious spots.' phoebe pointed toward two
adhesive-taped areas beneath the dining-room table.

   'what's that tape doing down there?' he asked.

   phoebe explained about the potential blood spots

   'blood?' prudence said. she stopped eating.

   phoebe pulled out the envelope and emptied the hair strands on the table
.'strange hairs' phoebe explained.

   prudence said. 'uck.'


   mr. winterbottom tapped his fork against his knife. then he stood up, took
phoebe's arm, and said, 'follow me.' he went to the refrigerator, opened the
freezer compartment, and indicated the plastic containers 'if your mother had
been kidnapped by a lunatic, would she have had time to prepare all these
meals? would she have been able to say, "excuse me, mr. lunatic, while i
prepare ten or twenty meals for my family to eat while i am kidnapped"?'

   when he returned from visiting mrs. cadaver, he said that she was unable
to give him any more information about phoebe's mother's call. all mrs.
winterbottom had said was. 'tell george i am fine and that i will phone him
soon. tell him i would phone him now if i could, but i can't.'

   'that's all?' phoebe asked.

   'your mother also asked mrs. cadaver how you and prudence were. mrs.
cadaver told her that, as far as she knew, you and prudence were fine.'

   'well, i am not fine,' phoebe said, 'and what does mrs. cadaver know
anyway, and besides, mrs. cadaver is making the whole thing up. you
should let the police talk to her. you should ask her about the rhododendron
bush. you should find out who this lunatic is mrs. cadaver probably hired

   'i'll tell you about mr. birkway's visit. then i'll stop for tonight.'


   i went over to phoebe's after dinner, on the day mr. birkway had read
from my journal about the black- berry kisses and from phoebe's about mrs.
cadaver and the body. phoebe, prudence and her father were still at the
dinner table. prudence was rattling on and on about cheerleading. she was
clapping her hands and reciting a new cheer: 'two-four-six-eight, who do we
appreciate?'

   'phoebe, aren't you going to eat anything?' her father asked.

   'two-four-six... prudence punched the air.

   'let's go upstairs,' phoebe said.

   across the library, beth ann called. 'sal, there's a spider - oh, sal, kill it!'

   when the final bell rang, phoebe and i were out of school like a shot. at
phoebe's house, we examined the telephone directory. 'we've got to hurry,'
phoebe said, 'before prudence or my father come home.' there were six
pickles listed in the directory. we took turns calling. each time, we asked
for sergeant pickle. the first two people said we must have the wrong
number. the third number we dialed was busy. the fourth number, no
answer. the fifth number was answered by a crotchety woman who said, 'i
don't know any sergeants!'


   the sixth number was answered by an elderly man who must have been
quite lonely because he talked on and on about once knowing a sergeant

what had become of sergeant freeman, and now that he thought about it, he
also knew a sergeant bones and a sergeant dowdy or maybe it was
dowper, he couldn't quite remember, but, no, he did not think that he knew a
sergeant pickle, although it would be nice to know a sergeant with the same
last name as his own.

   'what are we going to do?' phoebe wailed. 'prudence will be home any
minute, and we still don't know which is the right pickle.'

   'let's try the busy number and the unanswered one again,' i said.

   the busy number was still busy. the previously unanswered one rang and
rang, and just as phoebe was about to hang up, she heard a voice. 'hello?'
she said. 'may i speak with sergeant pickle, please?' there was a pause as
she listened. 'he's still at work?' phoebe was jumping up and down. 'thank
you,' she said, trying to make her voice serious 'it

   'yes!' she said when she hung up. 'yes, yes, yes!' she was hugging me half

copied the pickles' address from the phone book and left a note for prudence
and her father saying that she and i had gone to the library.

   the bickles lived three miles from phoebe's. we took a bus and then
walked the last half-mile, stopping for directions about thirty times. i
thought we would never find it, but, at last, we did. the pickles lived in a
brick ranch house in a new development. we walked up and down the street.
there was a light on in the ~ living room, but no car in the driveway.

   'why would they do that?'

   'who knows? i'm sick of it. my mother can stay there for all i care. she
doesn't need me. she doesn't need any of us.'

   phoebe was like that all the way home on the bus. she was in an
extensively black mood. i did not tell her about ben. we got back to
phoebe's house just as her father pulled in the driveway. prudence rushed
out of the house saying, 'she called, she called, she called!'

   'who called?' mr. winterbottom said.

   prudence was beside herself. 'mom, of course. just ten minutes ago. she's
coming home.'

   'terrific,' phoebe muttered.

   'what was that, phoebe?' her father said.

   'nothing.'

   'she's coming tomorrow,' prudence said. 'but--'

most, most, important! she said that she was bringing some- one with her.

   'oh, that's just grand,' phoebe said. 'just grand.'

   'phoebe-?' her father said. 'prudence - did she say who she is bringing?'

   'i honestly could not say.'

   'prudence, are you exactly sure that is all she said? did she refer to this
person at all? did she mention a name?' he was getting agitated.

   'why, no,' prudence said. 'she didn't mention a name. she just said that she
was bringing him with her.

   'him?'

   phoebe looked at me. 'cripes,' she said, and she went into the house,
slamming the door behind her.

   i couldn't believe it. wasn't she going to tell her father what she had seen?
i was bursting at the seams to tell my own father, but when i got home, he
and margaret were sitting on the porch.

   'oh, sal,' margaret said. 'my brother told me you're in his english class.
what a surprise.' she mu

because he
didn't look too surprised. 'he's a terrific teacher. do you like him?'

   'i suppose.' i didn't want to talk about it. i wanted margaret to vanish.


   i had to wait until she went home to tell my father about phoebe's mother,
and when i did tell him, all he said was, 'so, mrs. winterbottom is coming
home. that's good. then he went over to the window and stared out of it for
the longest time, and i knew he was thinking about my mother.

   all that night i thought about phoebe and prudence and mr. winterbottom.
it seemed like their whole world was going to fall apart the next day when
mrs. winterbottom walked in all cuddly with the lunatic.


40. homecoming


   the next morning, phoebe phoned, begging me to come over. 'i can't stand
it,' she said. 'i want a witness'

   'for what?'

   'i just want a witness'

   'did you tell your father? about your mother and--' 'are you kidding?'
phoebe said. 'you should see him. he and prudence spent all last night and
this morning cleaning

y and ironing, and they
vacuumed. 'then, they took a good look around. my father said, "maybe it
looks too good. your mother will think we can function without her." so
they messed things up a little. he is very put out with me that i wouldn't
help.'

   i tried to think of a good reason why i could not go to phoebe's i did not
want to be a witness to anything, but, in the end, i felt guilty for running
away the day before, and so i agreed.. when i got to her house, phoebe, mr.
winterbottom and prudence were sitting there staring at each other.

   'didn't she say what time she was coming?' mr. winterbottom asked.

   prudence said, 'no, she did not, and i wish you would quit acting as if it is
my fault that she did not say more than she did.'

   mr. winterbottom was a wreck. he jumped up to straighten a pillow, sat
back down, and then he leaped up to mess up the pillow again. he went out
in the yard and walked around in circles. he changed his shirt twice.


   'i hope you don't mind that i

 am here,' i said.

   'why would i mind?' mr. winterbottom said.

   just as i thought they would ah go stark raving mad, a taxi pulled up
outside. 'i can't look,' mr. winterbottom said, escaping to the kitchen.

   'i can't look either,' phoebe said. she followed her father, and i followed
phoebe.

   'well, gosh,' prudence said. 'i don't know what has gotten into everybody.
aren't you excited to see her?'

   from the kitchen, we heard prudence open the front door. we heard mrs.
winterbottom say, 'oh, sweetie-- mr. winterbottom wiped the kitchen
counter. we heard prudence gasp and her mother say, 'i'd like you to meet
mike.'

   'mike?' mr. winterbottom said. he was quite red in the face. i was glad
there was no axe in the house or i am fairly certain he would have picked it
up and headed straight for mike.

   phoebe said, 'now, dad, don't do anything too rash--'

   'mike?' he repeated.

   mrs. winterbottom called, 'george? phoebe?

' we heard her say to
prudence, 'where are they? didn't you tell them we were coming?'

   mr. winterbottom took a deep breath. he said, 'phoebe, i'm not sure you
or sal should be around for this'

   'are you kidding?' phoebe said. he took another deep breath. 'ok,' he said.
'ok. here we go.' he stood up straight and tall and walked through to the
living room. phoebe and i followed.

   honest and truly, i think phoebe nearly fainted dead away on the carpet.
there were two reasons for this the first one was that mrs. winter

of mike. she seemed
afraid of her husband.

   'dad,' phoebe whispered, 'that's the lunatic.'

   'oh, phoebe,' her mother said, pressing her fingers to her cheek, and when
she made that familiar gesture, phoebe looked as if her heart was splitting
into a thou- sand pieces. mrs. winterbottom hugged phoebe, but phoebe did
not hug her back.

   mr. winterbotttom said, 'norma, i hope you are going to explain exactly
what is going on here.' he was trying to make his voice firm, but it trembled.

   prudence stood there, staring at mike. she seemed to find him quite
handsome and was flirting with him. she fluffed her hair away from her
neck.

   mrs. winterbottom went up to mr. winterbottom and tried to put her arms
around him, but he pulled away. 'i think we deserve an explanation,' he said.
he was staring at mike.

   so was i. i was quite confused. was she in love with mike? and, if she
was in love with him, he seemed awfully, awfully young. he didn't seem
much older than prudence.

ry, very hard all these years to be
perfect, but that she had to admit she was quite imperfect. she said there was
something that she had never told her husband, and she feared he would not
forgive her for it.

   mr. winterbottom's hands were trembling. he did not say anything. mrs.
winterbottom motioned for mike to join her on the sofa. mr. winterbottom
cleared his throat several times, but still he said nothing.

   mrs. winterbottom said, 'this is my son.'

   i think that mr. winterbottom, prudence, phoebe and i all said at exactly
the same time, 'your son?'

   mrs. winterbottom stared at her husband. 'george,' she said, 'i know you
will think i am not - or was not - respectable, but it was before i met you,
and i had to give him up for adoption and i could hardly bear to think of it
and--'

   mr. winterbottom said. 'respectable? respectable? the hell with
respectable!' mr. winterbottom did not normally swear.

   mrs. winterbottom stood up. 'mike found me, and at first i was frightened

concerned that you couldn't - or wouldn't - tell me about any of this.'

   mike stood up. 'i knew it wouldn't work,' he said.

   mr. winterbottom said, 'i have nothing against you, mike - i just don't
know you.' he looked at his wife. 'i don't think i know you, either.

   i was wishing i was invisible. i stared out the window at the leaves falling
to the ground, and i was infinitely sad, sad down to my bones. i was sad for
phoebe and her parents and prudence and mike, i was sad for the leaves that
were dying, and i was sad for myself, for something i had lost.

   i saw mrs. partridge out front, standing on phoebe's front walk.

   mr. winterbottom said, 'i think we all need to sit down and talk. maybe
we can sort something out. then he did what i think was a noble thing. he
went over to mike and shook his hand and said, 'i did always think a son
would be a nice addition to this family.

   mrs. winterbottom looked extensively relieved. prudence sm
