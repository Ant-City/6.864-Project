[CHARACTER] - 
                 
the king of camelot. in sir gawain and the green knight,
arthur is young and beardless, and his court is in its golden age.
arthur's refusal to eat until he hears a fantastic tale shows the
petulance of youth, as does arthur's initial stunned response to
the green knight's challenge. however, like a good king, arthur
soon steps forward to take on the challenge. at the story's end,
arthur joins his nephew in wearing a green girdle on his arm, showing
that gawain's trial has taught him about his own fallibility.
