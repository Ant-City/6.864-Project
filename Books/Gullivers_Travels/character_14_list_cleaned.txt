[CHARACTER] - 
                gulliver's wife, whose perfunctory mention in the
first paragraphs of gulliver's travels demonstrates
how unsentimental and unemotional gulliver is. he makes no reference
to any affection for his wife, either here or later in his travels
when he is far away from her, and his detachment is so cool as to
raise questions about his ability to form human attachments. when
he returns to england, she is merely one part of his former existence,
and he records no emotion even as she hugs him wildly. the most
important facts about her in gulliver's mind are her social origin
and the income she generates.
