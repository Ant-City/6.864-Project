ath a low roof quite as
gracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possible
he could have done in any lofty hall.

and perhaps it was the pleasure the good spirit had in
showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind,
generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor
men, that led him straight to scrooge's clerk's; for there he
went, and took scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and
on the threshold of the door the spirit smiled, and stopped
to bless bob cratchit's dwelling with the sprinkling of his
torch. think of that! bob had but fifteen "bob" a-week
himself; he pocketed on saturdays but fifteen copies of his
christian name; and yet the ghost of christmas present
blessed his four-roomed house!

then up rose mrs. cratchit, cratchit's wife, dressed out
but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons,
which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and
she laid the cloth, assisted by belinda cratchit, second of
her daughters, als

o brave in ribbons; while master peter
cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and
getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (bob's private
property, conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the
day) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly
attired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable parks.
and now two smaller cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing
in, screaming that outside the baker's they had smelt the
goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious
thoughts of sage and onion, these young cratchits danced
about the table, and exalted master peter cratchit to the
skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked
him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up,
knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and
peeled.

"what has ever got your precious father then?

" said mrs.
cratchit. "and your brother, tiny tim! and martha
warn't as late last christmas day by half-an-hour?"

"here's martha, mother!" said a girl, appearing as she
spoke.

"here's martha, mother!" cried the two young cratchits.
"hurrah! there's such a goose, martha!"

"why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!"
said mrs. cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off
her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal.

"we'd a deal of work to finish up last night," replied the
girl, "and had to clear away this morning, mother!"

"well! never mind so long as you are come," said mrs.
cratchit. "sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have
a warm, lord bless ye!"

"no, no! there's father coming," cried the two young
cratchits, who were everywhere at once. "hide, martha,
hide!"

so martha hid herself, and

 in came little bob, the father,
with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe,
hanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes darned
up and brushed, to look seasonable; and tiny tim upon his
shoulder. alas for tiny tim, he bore a little crutch, and
had his limbs supported by an iron frame!

"why, where's our martha?" cried bob cratchit, looking
round.

"not coming," said mrs. cratchit.

"not coming!" said bob, with a sudden declension in his
high spirits; for he had been tim's blood horse all the way
from church, and had come home rampant. "not coming
upon christmas day!"

martha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only
in joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet
door, and ran into his arms, while the two young cratchits
hustled tiny tim, and bore him off into the wash-house,
that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper.

"and

 how did little tim behave?" asked mrs. cratchit,
when she had rallied bob on his credulity, and bob had
hugged his daughter to his heart's content.

"as good as gold," said bob, "and better. somehow he
gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the
strangest things you ever heard. he told me, coming home,
that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he
was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember
upon christmas day, who made lame beggars walk, and blind
men see."

bob's voice was tremulous w

e said that tiny tim was growing
strong and hearty.

his active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back
came tiny tim before another word was spoken, escorted by
his brother and sister to his stool before the fire; and while
bob, turning up his cuffs--as if, poor fellow, they were
capable of being made more shabby--compounded some hot
mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round
and round and put it on the hob to simmer; master peter,
and the two ubiquitous young cratchits went to fetch the
goose, with which they soon returned in high procession.

such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose
the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a
black swan was a matter of course--and in truth it was
something very like it in that house. mrs. cratchit made
the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot;
master peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour;
miss belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; martha dusted

t plates; bob took tiny tim beside him in a tiny
corner at the table; the two young cratchits set chairs for
everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard
upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest
they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be
helped. at last the dishes were set on, and grace was
said. it was succeeded by a breathless pause, as mrs.
cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared
to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the
long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of
delight arose

 all round the board, and even tiny tim,
excited by the two young cratchits, beat on the table with
the handle of his knife, and feebly cried hurrah!

there never was such a goose. bob said he didn't believe
there ever was such a goose cooked. its tenderness and
flavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal
admiration. eked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes,
it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as
mrs. cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small
atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at
last! yet every one had had enough, and the youngest
cratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to
the eyebrows! but now, the plates being changed by miss
belinda, mrs. cratchit left the room alone--too nervous to
bear witnesses--to take the pudding up and bring it in.

suppose it should not be done enough! suppose it should
break in turning out! suppose somebody should ha

ve got
over the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they
were merry with the goose--a supposition at which the two
young cratchits became livid! all sorts of horrors were
supposed.

hallo! a great deal of steam! the pudding was out of
the copper. a smell like a washing-day! that was the
cloth. a smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook's next
door to each other, with a laundress's next door to that!
that was the pudding! in half a minute mrs. cratchit
entered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding,
like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half
of half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with
christmas holly stuck into the top.

oh, a wonderful pudding! bob cratchit said, and calmly
too, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by
mrs. cratchit since their marriage. mrs. cratchit said that
now the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had
had her doubts about the quantity of flour

. everybody had
something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it
was at all a small pudding for a large family. it would have
been flat heresy to do so. any cratchit would have blushed
to hint at such a thing.

at last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the
hearth swept, and the fire made up. the compound in the
jug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and oranges
were put upon the table, and a shovel-full of chestnuts on the
fire. then all the cratchit family drew round the hearth, in
what bob cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and
at bob cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.
two tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.

these held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as
golden goblets would have done; and bob served it out with
beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and
cracked noisily. then bob proposed:

"a merry christmas to us all, my dears. god bless us!"

which all the

sight of heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live
than millions like this poor man's child. oh god! to hear
the insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life
among his hungry brothers in the dust!"

scrooge bent before the ghost's rebuke, and trembling cast
his eyes upon the ground. but he raised them speedily, on
hearing his own name.

"mr. scrooge!" said bob; "i'll give you mr. scrooge, the
founder of the feast!"

"the founder of the feast indeed!" cried mrs. cratchit,
reddening. "i wish i had him here. i'd give him a piece
of my mind to feast upon, and i hope he'd have a good
appetite for it."

"my dear," said bob, "the children! christmas day."

"it should be christmas day, i am sure," said she, "on
which one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy, hard,
unfeeling man as mr. scrooge. you know he is, robert!
nobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow!"

"my dear," was bob's mild answer, "christmas day."

mrs. cratchit, "not for his. long life to him! a merry

the children drank the toast after her. it was the first of
their proceedings which had no heartiness. tiny tim drank
it last of all, but he didn't care twopence for it. scrooge
was the ogre of the family. the mention of his name cast
a dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full
five minutes.

rier than
before, from the mere relief of scrooge the baleful being done
with. bob cratchit told them how he had a situation in his
eye for master peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full
five-and-sixpence weekly. the two young cratchits laughed
tremendously at the idea of peter's being a man of business;
and peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from
between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular
investments he should favour when he came into the receipt
of that bewildering income. martha, who was a poor
apprentice at a milliner's, then told them what kind of work
she had to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch,
and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a
good long rest; t

nd it was a happier
house for this man's death! the only emotion that the
ghost could show him, caused by the event, was one of
pleasure.

"let me see some tenderness connected with a death," said
scrooge; "or that dark chamber, spirit, which we left just
now, will be for ever present to me."

the ghost conducted him through several streets familiar
to his feet; and as they went along, scrooge looked here and
there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen. they
entered poor bob cratchit's house; the dwelling he had
visited before; and found the mother and the children seated
round the fire.

quiet. very quiet. the noisy little cratchits were as
still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at peter,
who had a book before him. the mother and her daughters
were engaged in sewing. but surely they were very quiet!

"'and he took a child, and set him in the midst of
them.'"

where had scrooge heard those words? he had not
dreamed them. the boy must have read them

out, as he
and the spirit crossed the threshold. why did he not
go on?

the mother laid her work upon the table, and put her
hand up to her face.

"the colour hurts my eyes," she said.

the colour? ah, poor tiny tim!

"they're better now again," said cratchit's wife. "it
makes them weak by candle-light; and i wouldn't show weak
eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world. it
must be near his time."

"past it rather," peter answered, shutting up his book.
"but i think he has walked a little slower than he used,
these few last evenings, mother."

they were very quiet again. at last she said, and in a
steady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once:

"i have known him walk with--i have known him walk
with tiny tim upon his should

t indeed."

"and so have i," cried peter. "often."

"and so have i," exclaimed another. so had all.

"but he was very light to carry," she resumed, intent upon
her work, "and his father loved him so, that it was no
trouble: no trouble. and there is your father at the door!"

she hurried out to meet him; and little bob in his comforter
--he had need of it, poor fellow--came in. his tea
was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should
help him to it most. then the two young cratchits got
upon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against
his face, as if they said, "don't mind it, father. don't be
grieved!"

bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to
all the family. he looked at the work upon the table, and
praised the industry and speed of mrs. cratchit and the girls.
they would be done long before sunday, he said.

"sunday! you went to-day, then, robert?" said his
wife.

"yes, my dear," returned bob. "i wish you could have
gone. it wou

t!" said peter.

"very well observed, my boy!" cried bob. "i hope they
do. 'heartily sorry,' he said, 'for your good wife. if i
can be of service to you in any way,' he said, giving me
his card, 'that's where i live. pray come to me.' now, it
wasn't," cried bob, "for the sake of anything he might be
able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was
quite delightful. it really seemed as if he had known our
tiny tim, and felt with us."

"i'm sure he's a good soul!" said mrs. cratchit.

"you would be surer of it, my dear," returned bob, "if
you saw and spoke to him. i shouldn't be at all surprised--
mark what i say!--if he got peter a better situation."

"only hear that, peter," said mrs. cratchit.

"and then," cried one of the girls, "peter will be keeping
company with some one, and setting up for himself."

"get along with you!" retorted peter, grinning.

"it's just as likely as not," said bob, "one of these days;
though there's plenty of time for that, my de

shall none of us forget poor tiny tim--shall we--or this
first parting that there was among us?"

"never, father!" cried they all.

"and i know," said bob, "i know, my dears, that when
we recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he
was a little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among
ourselves, and forget poor tiny tim in doing it."

"no, never, father!" they all cried again.

"i am very happy," said little bob, "i am very happy!"

mrs. cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the
two young cratchits kissed him, and peter and himself shook
hands. spirit of tiny tim, thy childish essence was from
god!

"spectre," said scrooge, "something informs me that our
parting moment is at hand. i know it, but i know not
how. tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead?"

the ghost of christmas yet to come conveyed him, as
before--though at a different time, he thought: indeed, there
seemed no order in these latter visions, sa

"is it?" said scrooge. "go and buy it."

"walk-er!" exclaimed the boy.

"no, no," said scrooge, "i am in earnest. go and buy
it, and tell 'em to bring it here, that i may give them the
direction where to take it. come back with the man, and
i'll give you a shilling. come back with him in less than
five minutes and i'll give you half-a-crown!"

the boy was off like a shot. he must have had a steady
hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast.

"i'll send it to bob cratchit's!" whispered scrooge,
rubbing his hands, and splitting with a laugh. "he sha'n't
know who sends it. it's twice the size of tiny tim. joe
miller never made such a joke as sending it to bob's
will be!"

the hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady
one, but write it he did, somehow, and went down-stairs to
open the street door, ready for the coming of the poulterer's
man. as he stood there, waiting his arrival, the knocker
caught his eye.

"i shall love it, as long as i liv

and a strait-waistcoat.

"a merry christmas, bob!" said scrooge, with an earnestness
that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the
back. "a merrier christmas, bob, my good fellow, than i
have given you, for many a year! i'll raise your salary, and
endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss
your affairs this very afternoon, over a christmas bowl of
smoking bishop, bob! make up the fires, and buy another
coal-scuttle before you dot another i, bob cratchit!"


scrooge was better than his word. he did it all, and
infinitely more; and to tiny tim, who did not die, he was
a second father. he became as good a friend, as good a
master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or
any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old
world. some people laughed to see the alteration in him,
but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was
wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this
globe, for good, at which some p
