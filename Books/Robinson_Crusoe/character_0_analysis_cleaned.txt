[CHARACTER] 
while he is no flashy hero or grand epic adventurer, robinson
crusoe displays character traits that have won him the approval
of generations of readers. his perseverance in spending months making
a canoe, and in practicing pottery making until he gets it right,
is praiseworthy. additionally, his resourcefulness in building a
home, dairy, grape arbor, country house, and goat stable from practically nothing
is clearly remarkable. the swiss philosopher jean-jacques rousseau
applauded crusoe's do-it-yourself independence, and in his book
on education, emile, he recommends that children
be taught to imitate crusoe's hands-on approach to life. crusoe's
business instincts are just as considerable as his survival instincts:
he manages to make a fortune in brazil despite a twenty-eight-year absence
and even leaves his island with a nice collection of gold. moreover,
crusoe is never interested in portraying himself as a hero in his
own narration. he does not boast of his courage in quelling the
mutiny, and he is always ready to admit unheroic feelings of fear or
panic, as when he finds the footprint on the beach. crusoe prefers to
depict himself as an ordinary sensible man, never as an exceptional
hero.

	but crusoe's admirable qualities must be weighed against
the flaws in his character. crusoe seems incapable of deep feelings,
as shown by his cold account of leaving his family--he worries about the
religious consequences of disobeying his father, but never displays
any emotion about leaving. though he is generous toward people,
as when he gives gifts to his sisters and the captain, crusoe reveals
very little tender or sincere affection in his dealings with them.
when crusoe tells us that he has gotten married and that his wife
has died all within the same sentence, his indifference to her seems
almost cruel. moreover, as an individual personality, crusoe is
rather dull. his precise and deadpan style of narration works well for
recounting the process of canoe building, but it tends to drain
the excitement from events that should be thrilling. action-packed scenes
like the conquest of the cannibals become quite humdrum when crusoe
narrates them, giving us a detailed inventory of the cannibals in
list form, for example. his insistence on dating events makes sense
to a point, but it ultimately ends up seeming obsessive and irrelevant
when he tells us the date on which he grinds his tools but neglects
to tell us the date of a very important event like meeting friday.
perhaps his impulse to record facts carefully is not a survival skill,
but an irritating sign of his neurosis.
	finally, while not boasting of heroism, crusoe is nonetheless very
interested in possessions, power, and prestige. when he first calls
himself king of the island it seems jocund, but when he describes
the spaniard as his subject we must take his royal delusion seriously,
since it seems he really does consider himself king. his teaching
friday to call him "master," even before teaching him the words
for "yes" or "no," seems obnoxious even under the racist standards
of the day, as if crusoe needs to hear the ego-boosting word spoken
as soon as possible. overall, crusoe's virtues tend to be private:
his industry, resourcefulness, and solitary courage make him an
exemplary individual. but his vices are social, and his urge to subjugate
others is highly objectionable. in bringing both sides together
into one complex character, defoe gives us a fascinating glimpse
into the successes, failures, and contradictions of modern man.
