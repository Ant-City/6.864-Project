[CHARACTER] - 
                caesar's
adopted son and appointed successor. [CHARACTER], who had been traveling
abroad, returns after caesar's death; he then joins with antony
and sets off to fight cassius and brutus. antony tries to control [CHARACTER]'s
movements, but [CHARACTER] follows his adopted father's example and
emerges as the authoritative figure, paving the way for his eventual seizure
of the reins of roman government.
