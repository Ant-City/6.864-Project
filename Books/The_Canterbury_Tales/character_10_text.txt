o "dan geffrey," to vindicate for
himself a place very close to his great predecessor in the literary
history of england. if chaucer is the "well of english
undefiled," spenser is the broad and stately river that yet holds
the tenure of its very life from the fountain far away in other
and ruder scenes.

the canterbury tales, so far as they are in verse, have been
printed without any abridgement or designed change in the
sense.  but the two tales in prose -- chaucer's tale of
meliboeus, and the parson's long sermon on penitence -- have
been contracted, so as to exclude thirty pages of unattractive
prose, and to admit the same amount of interesting and
characteristic poetry.  the gaps thus made in the prose tales,
however, are supplied by careful outlines of the omitted matter,
so that the reader need be at no loss to comprehend the whole
scope and sequence of the original.  with the faerie queen a
bolder course has been pursued. the great obstacle to the
popularity of spencer's splendid work

canterbury tales are presented in this edition with as near
an approach to completeness as regard for the popular character
of the volume permitted. the 17,385 verses, of which the
poetical tales consist, have been given without abridgement or
purgation -- save in a single couplet; but, the main purpose of
the volume being to make the general reader acquainted with
the "poems" of chaucer and spenser, the editor has ventured to
contract the two prose tales -- chaucer's tale of meliboeus,
and the parson's sermon or treatise on penitence -- so as to
save about thirty pages for the introduction of chaucer's minor
pieces. at the same time, by giving prose outlines of the omitted
parts, it has been sought to guard the reader against the fear
that he was losing anything essential, or even valuable. it is
almost needless to describe the plot, or point out the literary
place, of the canterbury tales. perhaps in the entire range of
ancient and modern literature there is no work that so clearly

notes to the prologue to the shipman's tale


1. the prologue here given was transferred by tyrwhitt from
the place, preceding the squire's tale, which it had formerly
occupied; the shipman's tale having no prologue in the best
manuscripts.

2. lollard: a contemptuous name for the followers of
wyckliffe; presumably derived from the latin, "lolium," tares,
as if they were the tares among the lord's wheat; so, a few lines
below, the shipman intimates his fear lest the parson should
"spring cockle in our clean corn."

3. cockle: a weed, the "agrostemma githago" of linnaeus;
perhaps named from the anglo-saxon, "ceocan," because it
chokes the corn.
(transcriber's note: it is also possible chaucer had in mind
matthew 13:25, where in some translations, an enemy sowed
"cockle" amongst the wheat. (other translations have "tares"
and "darnel".))

10. bratt:  coarse cloak; anglo-saxon, "bratt." the word is
still used in lincolnshire, and some parts of the north, to
signify a coarse kind of apron.

11. long on: in consequence of; the modern vulgar phrase "all
along of," or "all along on," best conveys the force of the
words in the text.

12. annualere: a priest employed in singing "annuals" or
anniversary masses for the dead, without any cure of souls;
the office was such as, in the prologue to the tales, chaucer
praises the parson for not seeking: nor "ran unto london,
unto saint poul's, to seeke him a chantery for souls."

13. mortify:  a chemical phrase, signifying the dissolution of
quicksilver in acid.

14. blin: cease; from anglo-saxon, "blinnan," to desist.

15. name: took; from anglo-saxon, "niman," to take.
compare german, "nehmen," "nahm."

16. los: praise, reputataion. see note 5 to chaucer's tale of
meliboeus.

17. grame: sorrow; anglo-saxon, "gram;" german, "gram."

notes to the prologue to the parson's tale


1. rom, ram, ruf: a contemptuous reference to the alliterative
poetry which was at that time very popular, in preference even,
it would seem, to rhyme, in the northern parts of the country,
where the language was much more barbarous and unpolished
than in the south.

2. perfect glorious pilgrimage:  the word is used here to signify
the shrine, or destination, to which pilgrimage is made.

nd the horrible pains of hell; 4. the sorrowful
remembrance of the good deeds that  man hath omitted to do
here on earth, and also the good that he hath lost, ought to
make him have contrition; 5. so also ought the remembrance of
the passion that our lord jesus christ suffered for our sins; 6.
and so ought the hope of three things, that is to say,
forgiveness of sin, the gift of grace to do well, and the glory of
heaven with which god shall reward man for his good deeds. --
all these points the parson illustrates and enforces at length;
waxing especially eloquent under the third head, and plainly
setting forth the sternly realistic notions regarding future
punishments that were entertained in the time of chaucer:-] <3>

certes, all the sorrow that a man might make from the
beginning of the world, is but a little thing, at retard of [in
comparison with] the sorrow of hell. the cause why that job
calleth hell the land of darkness; <4> understand, that he calleth

dread shall ever dwell in the hearts of them that be damned.
and therefore have they lost all their hope for seven causes.
first, for god that is their judge shall be without mercy to them;
nor they may not please him; nor none of his hallows [saints];
nor they may give nothing for their ransom; nor they have no
voice to speak to him; nor they may not flee from pain; nor they
have no goodness in them that they may shew to deliver them
from pain.

[under the fourth head, of good works, the parson says: --]

the courteous lord jesus christ will that no good work be lost,
for in somewhat it shall avail. but forasmuch as the good works
that men do while they be in good life be all amortised [killed,
deadened] by sin following, and also since all the good works
that men do while they be in deadly sin be utterly dead, as for to
have the life perdurable [everlasting], well may that man that no
good works doth, sing that new french song, j'ai tout perdu --
mon temps et mon labour <5>. for cert

to god, as long as he hath lived, and
also as long as he shall live, that no goodness hath to pay with
his debt to god, to whom he oweth all his life: for trust well he
shall give account, as saith saint bernard, of all the goods that
have been given him in his present life, and how he hath them
dispended, insomuch that there shall not perish an hair of his
head, nor a moment of an hour shall not perish of his time, that
he shall not give thereof a reckoning.

[having treated of the causes, the parson comes to the manner,
of contrition -- which should be universal and total, not merely
of outward deeds of sin, but also of wicked delights and
thoughts and words; "for certes almighty god is all good, and
therefore either he forgiveth all, or else right naught." further,
contrition should be "wonder sorrowful and anguishous," and
also continual, with steadfast purpose of confession and
amendment. lastly, of what contrition availeth, the parson says,
that sometimes it delivereth man from sin; th

mpany of the devil, and

spiritual, and to the company and communion of holy church."
he who should set his intent to these things, would no longer be
inclined to sin, but would give his heart and body to the service
of jesus christ, and thereof do him homage. "for, certes, our
lord jesus christ hath spared us so benignly in our follies, that
if he had not pity on man's soul, a sorry song might we all sing."

the second part of the parson's tale or treatise opens with an
explanation of what is confession -- which is termed "the
second part of penitence, that is, sign of contrition;" whether it
ought needs be done or not; and what things be convenable to
true confession. confession is true shewing of sins to the priest,
without excusing, hiding, or forwrapping [disguising] of
anything, and without vaunting of good works. "also, it is
necessary to understand whence that sins spring, and how they
increase, and which they be." from 
 
 ___________________________
 
adam we took original sin;
"from him fleshly descended be we all, and engendered of vile
and corrupt matter;" and the penalty of adam's transgression
dwelleth with us as to temptation, which penalty is called
concupiscence. "this concupiscence, when it is wrongfully
disposed or ordained in a man, it maketh him covet, by covetise
of flesh, fleshly sin by sight of his eyes, as to earthly things, and
also covetise of highness by pride of heart." the parson
proceeds to shew how man is tempted in his flesh to sin; how,
after his natural concupiscence, comes suggestion of the devil,
that is to say the devil's bellows, with which he bloweth in man
the fire of con cupiscence; and how man then bethinketh him
whether he will do or no the thing to which he is tempted. if he
flame up into pleasure at the thought, and give way, then is he
all dead in soul; "and thus is sin accomplished, by temptation, by
delight, and by consenting; and then is the sin actu

same harm do sometimes the small drops, of water that enter
through a little crevice in the thurrok [hold, bilge], and in the
bottom of the ship, if men be so negligent that they discharge
them not betimes. and therefore, although there be difference
betwixt these two causes of drenching, algates [in any case] the
ship is dreint [sunk]. right so fareth it sometimes of deadly sin,"
and of venial sins when they multiply in a man so greatly as to
make him love worldly things more than god. the parson then
enumerates specially a number of sins which many a man
peradventure deems no sins, and confesses them not, and yet
nevertheless they are truly sins: -- ]

this is to say, at every time that a man eateth and drinketh more
than sufficeth to the sustenance of his body, in certain he doth
sin; eke when he speaketh more than it needeth, he doth sin; eke
when he heareth not benignly the complaint of the poor; eke
when he is in health of body, and will not fast when other folk
fast, without cause

s; yet may he refrain
him, by the burning love that he hath to our lord jesus christ,
and by prayer and confession, and other good works, so that it
shall but little grieve. "furthermore, men may also refrain and
put away venial sin, by receiving worthily the precious body of
jesus christ; by receiving eke of holy water; by alms-deed; by
general confession of confiteor at mass, and at prime, and at
compline [evening service]; and by blessing of bishops and
priests, and by other good works." the parson then proceeds to
weightier matters:-- ]

now it is behovely [profitable, necessary] to tell which be
deadly sins, that is to say, chieftains of sins; forasmuch as all
they run in one leash, but in diverse manners. now be they
called chieftains, forasmuch as they be chief, and of them spring
all other sins. the root of these sins, then, is pride, the general
root of all harms. for of this root spring certain branches: as ire,
envy, accidie <6> or sloth, avarice or covetousness (to common
underst

his heart the less upon our lord jesus christ, certain
it is a sin; and certainly the delights might be so great in this
case, that a man might lightly [easily] fall by them into deadly
sin.

[the sins that arise of pride advisedly and habitually are deadly;
those that arise by frailty unadvised suddenly, and suddenly
withdraw again, though grievous, are not deadly. pride itself
springs sometimes of the goods of nature, sometimes of the
goods of fortune, sometimes of the goods of grace; but the
parson, enumerating and examining all these in turn, points out
how little security they possess and how little ground for pride
they furnish, and goes on to enforce the remedy against pride --
which is humility or meekness, a virtue through which a man
hath true knowledge of himself, and holdeth no high esteem of
himself in regard of his deserts, considering ever his frailty.]

now be there three manners [kinds] of humility; as humility in
heart, and another in the mouth, and the third in works. the

 
 ___________________________
 
 he is
such as he thinketh that he is in his heart; another is, when he
praiseth the bounte [goodness] of another man and nothing
thereof diminisheth. humility eke in works is in four manners:
the first is, when he putteth other men before him; the second is,
to choose the lowest place of all; the third is, gladly to assent to
good counsel; the fourth is, to stand gladly by the award
[judgment] of his sovereign, or of him that is higher in degree:
certain this is a great work of humility.

[the parson proceeds to treat of the other cardinal sins, and
their remedies: (2.) envy, with its remedy, the love of god
principally and of our neighbours as ourselves: (3.) anger, with
all its fruits in revenge, rancour, hate, discord, manslaughter,
blasphemy, swearing, falsehood, flattery, chiding and reproving,
scorning, treachery, sowing of strife, doubleness of tongue,
betraying of counsel to a man's disgrace, menacing, idle words,
jangling, japery or buffoonery, &c. -- and its remedy in the
virtues

re idolaters, oppressors and enslavers
of men, deceivers of their equals in business, simoniacs,
gamblers, liars, thieves, false swearers, blasphemers, murderers,
and sacrilegious. its remedy lies in compassion and pity largely
exercised, and in reasonable liberality -- for those who spend on
"fool-largesse," or ostentation of worldly estate and luxury,
shall receive the malison [condemnation] that christ shall give
at the day of doom to them that shall be damned: (6.) gluttony;
-- of which the parson treats so briefly that the chapter may be
given in full: -- ]

after avarice cometh gluttony, which is express against the
commandment of god. gluttony is unmeasurable appetite to eat
or to drink; or else to do in aught to the unmeasurable appetite
and disordered covetousness [craving] to eat or drink. this sin
corrupted all this world, as is well shewed in the sin of adam
and of eve. look also what saith saint paul of gluttony:
"many," saith he, "go, of which i have oft said to you, and now

appetite of eating; soberness also, that restraineth the outrage of
drink; sparing also, that restraineth the delicate ease to sit long
at meat, wherefore some folk stand of their own will to eat,
because they will eat at less leisure.

[at great length the parson then points out the many varieties of
the sin of (7.) lechery, and its remedy in chastity and
continence, alike in marriage and in widowhood; also in the
abstaining from all such indulgences of eating, drinking, and

notes to the parson's tale


1. the parson's tale is believed to be a translation, more or less
free, from some treatise on penitence that was in favour about
chaucer's time. tyrwhitt says: "i cannot recommend it as a very
entertaining or edifying performance at this day; but the reader
will please to remember, in excuse both of chaucer and of his
editor, that, considering the canterbury tales as a great picture
of life and manners, the piece would not have been complete if
it had not included the religion of the

time." the editor of the
present volume has followed the same plan adopted with regard
to chaucer's tale of meliboeus, and mainly for the same
reasons. (see note 1 to that tale). an outline of the parson's
ponderous sermon -- for such it is -- has been drawn; while
those passages have been given in full which more directly
illustrate the social and the religious life of the time -- such as
the picture of hell, the vehement and rather coarse, but, in an
antiquarian sense, most curious and valuable attack on the
fashionable garb of the day, the catalogue of venial sins, the
description of gluttony and its remedy, &c. the brief third or
concluding part, which contains the application of the whole,

and the "retractation" or "prayer" that closes the tale and the
entire "magnum opus" of chaucer, have been given in full.

2. jeremiah vi. 16.

3. see note 3 to the sompnour's tale.

4. just before, the parson had cited the words of job to god
(job x. 20-22), "suffer, lord, that i may a while bewail and
weep, ere i go without returning to the dark land, covered with
the darkness of death; to the land of misease and of darkness,
where as is the shadow of death; where as is no order nor
ordinance, but grisly dread that ever shall last."

5. "i have lost everything - my time and my work."

6. accidie: neglectfulness or indifference; from the greek,
akedeia.

o much to expose their abuses
and ignorance, and to weaken their hold on popular credulity:
on the other hand, chaucer himself at the close of his life, is
said to have greatly lamented the ribaldry and the attacks on the
clergy which marked especially "the canterbury tales," and to
have drawn up a formal retractation of which the "prayer" is
either a copy or an abridgment. the beginning and end of the
"prayer," as tyrwhitt points out, are in tone and terms quite
appropriate in the mouth of the parson, while they carry on the
subject of which he has been treating; and, despite the fact that
mr wright holds the contrary opinion, tyrwhitt seems to be
justified in setting down the "retractation" as interpolated into
the close of the parson's tale. of the circumstances under
which the interpolation was made, or the causes by which it was
dictated, little or nothing can now be confidently affirmed; but
the agreement of the manuscripts and the early editions in
giving it, render it impossible to d

 the court of love.

12. in the prologue to the "legend of good women," chaucer
says that behind the god of love, upon the green, he "saw
coming in ladies nineteen;" but the stories of only nine good
women are there told. in the prologue to the man of law's
tale, sixteen ladies are named as having their stories written in
the "saints' legend of cupid" -- now known as the "legend of
good women" -- (see note 5 to the prologue to the man of
law's tale); and in the "retractation," at the end of the parson's
tale, the "book of the twenty-five ladies" is enumerated
among the works of which the poet repents -- but there "xxv" is
supposed to have been by some copyist written for "xix."

13. fele: many; german, "viele."

14. arras: tapestry of silk, made at arras, in france.

15. danger, in the provencal courts of love, was the
allegorical personification of the husband; and disdain suitably
represents the lover's corresponding difficulty from the side of
the lady.
