  with golden flow'rs and winding foliage wrought,
  her mother leda's present, when she came
  to ruin troy and set the world on flame;
  the scepter priam's eldest daughter bore,
  her orient necklace, and the crown she wore
  of double texture, glorious to behold,
  one order set with gems, and one with gold.
  instructed thus, the wise achates goes,
