[CHARACTER] - 
                    the
fearsome demon who guards the cedar forest forbidden to mortals.
[CHARACTER]'s seven garments produce an aura that paralyzes with fear
anyone who would withstand him. he is the personification of awesome
natural power and menace. his mouth is fire, he roars like a flood,
and he breathes death, much like an erupting volcano. in his very
last moments he acquires personality and pathos, when he pleads cunningly
for his life.
