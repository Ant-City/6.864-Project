reserved with much hesitation, solely for the purpose of enabling us to
endure the tasks they lay upon our shoulders. the finest and the fattest
is for their board; the loveliest is for their couch; the best and
bravest supply their foreign masters with soldiers, and whiten distant
lands with their bones, leaving few here who have either will or the
power to protect the unfortunate saxon. god’s blessing on our master
cedric, he hath done the work of a man in standing in the gap; but
reginald front-de-boeuf is coming down to this country in person, and we
shall soon see how little cedric’s trouble will avail him.--here, here,”
 he exclaimed again, raising his voice, “so ho! so ho! well done, fangs!
thou hast them all before thee now, and bring’st them on bravely, lad.”

“gurth,” said the jester, “i know thou thinkest me a fool, or thou

“ay, but,” answered prior aymer, “every land has its own manners and
fashions; and, besides that beating this fellow could procure us no
information respecting the road to cedric’s house, it would have been
sure to have established a quarrel betwixt you and him had we found our
way thither. remember what i told you: this wealthy franklin is proud,
fierce, jealous, and irritable, a withstander of the nobility, and even
of his neighbors, reginald front-de-boeuf and philip malvoisin, who are
no babies to strive with. he stands up sternly for the privileges of
his race, and is so proud of his uninterrupted descend from hereward, a
renowned champion of the heptarchy, that he is universally called cedric
the saxon; and makes a boast of his belonging to a people from whom
many others endeaver to hide their descent, lest they should encounter a
share of the ‘vae victis,’ or severities imposed upon the vanquished.”

upon a topic so harsh to saxon ears.

“the foul fiend,” exclaimed cedric, “take the curfew-bell, and the
tyrannical bastard by whom it was devised, and the heartless slave who
names it with a saxon tongue to a saxon ear! the curfew!” he added,
pausing, “ay, the curfew; which compels true men to extinguish their
lights, that thieves and robbers may work their deeds in darkness!--ay,
the curfew;--reginald front-de-boeuf and philip de malvoisin know the
use of the curfew as well as william the bastard himself, or e’er a
norman adventurer that fought at hastings. i shall hear, i guess,
that my property has been swept off to save from starving the hungry
banditti, whom they cannot support but by theft and robbery. my faithful
slave is murdered, and my goods are taken for a prey--and wamba--where

oswald replied in the affirmative.

the central pavilion, as the place of honour, had been assigned to brian
be bois-guilbert, whose renown in all games of chivalry, no less than
his connexions with the knights who had undertaken this passage of
arms, had occasioned him to be eagerly received into the company of the
challengers, and even adopted as their chief and leader, though he had
so recently joined them. on one side of his tent were pitched those of
reginald front-de-boeuf and richard de malvoisin, and on the other was
the pavilion of hugh de grantmesnil, a noble baron in the vicinity,
whose ancestor had been lord high steward of england in the time of the
conqueror, and his son william rufus. ralph de vipont, a knight of st
john of jerusalem, who had some ancient possessions at a place called
heather, near ashby-de-la-zouche, occupied the fifth pavilion. from the

“what! is it front-de-boeuf,” said the black knight, “who has stopt on
the king’s highway the king’s liege subjects?--is he turned thief and
oppressor?”

“oppressor he ever was,” said locksley.

“and for thief,” said the priest, “i doubt if ever he were even half so
honest a man as many a thief of my acquaintance.”

should do to that of a literal robber. let him name the ransom at which
he rates our liberty, and it shall be paid, providing the exaction is
suited to our means.” the sewer made no answer, but bowed his head.

“and tell sir reginald front-de-boeuf,” said athelstane, “that i send
him my mortal defiance, and challenge him to combat with me, on foot or
horseback, at any secure place, within eight days after our liberation;
which, if he be a true knight, he will not, under these circumstances,
venture to refuse or to delay.”

“i shall deliver to the knight your defiance,” answered the sewer;
“meanwhile i leave you to your food.”

the challenge of athelstane was delivered with no good grace; for a
large mouthful, which required

from the wet pavement, isaac sat in a
corner of his dungeon, where his folded hands, his dishevelled hair and
beard, his furred cloak and high cap, seen by the wiry and broken light,
would have afforded a study for rembrandt, had that celebrated painter
existed at the period. the jew remained, without altering his position,
for nearly three hours, at the expiry of which steps were heard on the
dungeon stair. the bolts screamed as they were withdrawn--the hinges
creaked as the wicket opened, and reginald front-de-boeuf, followed by
the two saracen slaves of the templar, entered the prison.

front-de-boeuf, a tall and strong man, whose life had been spent in
public war or in private feuds and broils, and who had hesitated at no
means of extending his feudal power, had features corresponding to his
character, and which strongly expressed the fiercer and more malignant
passions of the mind. the scars with which his visage was seamed,
would, on features of a different cast, have excited the sympathy and

in spite of the feeble struggles of the old man, the saracens had
already torn from him his upper garment, and were proceeding totally to
disrobe him, when the sound of a bugle, twice winded without the castle,
penetrated even to the recesses of the dungeon, and immediately
after loud voices were heard calling for sir reginald front-de-boeuf.
unwilling to be found engaged in his hellish occupation, the savage
baron gave the slaves a signal to restore isaac’s garment, and, quitting
the dungeon with his attendants, he left the jew to thank god for
his own deliverance, or to lament over his daughter’s captivity,
and probable fate, as his personal or parental feelings might prove
strongest.

“thou dost not fear,” said the templar, “that they can assemble in force
sufficient to attempt the castle?”

“not so, sir brian,” answered front-de-boeuf. “these outlaws have indeed
a daring captain; but without machines, scaling ladders, and experienced
leaders, my castle may defy them.”

“send to thy neighbours,” said the templar, “let them assemble their
people, and come to the rescue of three knights, besieged by a jester
and a swineherd in the baronial castle of reginald front-de-boeuf!”

“you jest, sir knight,” answered the baron; “but to whom should i
send?--malvoisin is by this time at york with his retainers, and so
are my other allies; and so should i have been, but for this infernal
enterprise.”

“then send to york, and recall our people,” said de bracy. “if they
abide the shaking of my standard, or the sight of my free companions,
i will give them credit for the boldest outlaws ever bent bow in
green-wood.”

“go, search them out, engelred,” said front-de-boeuf; “and then, sir
templar, thou shalt return an answer to this bold challenge.”

“i would rather do it at the sword’s point than at that of the pen,”
 said bois-guilbert; “but be it as you will.”

he sat down accordingly, and indited, in the french language, an epistle
of the following tenor:--“sir reginald front-de-boeuf, with his noble
and knightly allies and confederates, receive no defiances at the hands
of slaves, bondsmen, or fugitives. if the person calling himself the
black knight have indeed a claim to the honours of chivalry, he ought
to know that he stands degraded by his present association, and has no
right to ask reckoning at the hands of good men of noble blood. touching

gate and demanded instant admission. with no small wonder he received
his master’s commands to admit the holy man immediately; and, having
previously manned the entrance to guard against surprise, he obeyed,
without further scruple, the commands which he had received. the
harebrained self-conceit which had emboldened wamba to undertake this
dangerous office, was scarce sufficient to support him when he found
himself in the presence of a man so dreadful, and so much dreaded, as
reginald front-de-boeuf, and he brought out his “pax vobiscum”, to which
he, in a good measure, trusted for supporting his character, with
more anxiety and hesitation than had hitherto accompanied it. but
front-de-boeuf was accustomed to see men of all ranks tremble in his
presence, so that the timidity of the supposed father did not give him
any cause of suspicion.

“who and whence art thou, priest?” said he.

“‘pax vobiscum’,” reiterated the jester, “i am a poor servant of st

the saxon prisoners were accordingly removed, just as they introduced
the monk ambrose, who appeared to be in great perturbation.

“this is the real ‘deus vobiscum’,” said wamba, as he passed the
reverend brother; “the others were but counterfeits.”

“holy mother,” said the monk, as he addressed the assembled knights, “i
am at last safe and in christian keeping!”

“safe thou art,” replied de bracy; “and for christianity, here is the
stout baron reginald front-de-boeuf, whose utter abomination is a jew;
and the good knight templar, brian de bois-guilbert, whose trade is to
slay saracens--if these are not good marks of christianity, i know no
other which they bear about them.”

“ye are friends and allies of our reverend father in god, aymer, prior
of jorvaulx,” said the monk, without noticing the tone of de bracy’s
reply; “ye owe him aid both by knightly faith and holy charity; for what
saith the blessed saint augustin, in his treatise ‘de civitate

castle.”

“to the battlements!” cried de bracy, “and let us mark what these knaves
do without;” and so saying, he opened a latticed window which led to
a sort of bartisan or projecting balcony, and immediately called from
thence to those in the apartment--“saint dennis, but the old monk hath
brought true tidings!--they bring forward mantelets and pavisses, [32]
and the archers muster on the skirts of the wood like a dark cloud
before a hailstorm.”

reginald front-de-boeuf also looked out upon the field, and immediately
snatched his bugle; and, after winding a long and loud blast, commanded
his men to their posts on the walls.

“de bracy, look to the eastern side, where the walls are lowest--noble
bois-guilbert, thy trade hath well taught thee how to attack and defend,
look thou to the western side--i myself will take post at the barbican.
yet, do not confine your exertions to any one spot, noble friends!--we

his bedside, “to say there is that which he dares not!”

the evil conscience and the shaken nerves of front-de-boeuf heard, in
this strange interruption to his soliloquy, the voice of one of those
demons, who, as the superstition of the times believed, beset the
beds of dying men to distract their thoughts, and turn them from the
meditations which concerned their eternal welfare. he shuddered and drew
himself together; but, instantly summoning up
