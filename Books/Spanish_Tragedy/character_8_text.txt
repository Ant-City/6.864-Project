f my bliss,
    forcing divorce betwixt my love and me;
    for in the late conflict with portingal
    my valour drew me into danger's mouth
    till life to death made passage through my wounds.
    when i was slain, my soul descended straight
    to pass the flowing stream of acheron;
    but churlish charon, only boatman there,
    said that, my rites of burial not perform'd,
    i might not sit amongst his passengers.
    ere sol had slept three nights in thetis' lap,
    and slak'd his smoking chariot in her flood,
    by don horatio, our knight-marshall's son,
    my funerals and obsequies were done.
    then was the ferryman of hell content
    to pass me over to the slimy strand
    that leads to fell avernus' ugly waves.
    there, pleasing cerberus with honeyed speech,
    i passed the perils of the foremost porch.
    not far from hence, amidst ten thousand souls,
    sat minos, eacus and rhadamant;
    to whom no sooner 'gan i make approach,
    to crave a passport for my wand

    "no, no!" said rhadamant, "it were not well
    with loving souls to place a martialist.
    he died in war, and must to martial fields,
    where wounded hector lives in lasting pain,
    and achilles' myrmidons do scour the plain."
    then minos, mildest censor of the three,
    made this device, to end the difference:
    "send him," quoth he, "to our infernal king,
    to doom him as best seems his majesty."
    to this effect my passport straight was drawn.
    in keeping on my way to pluto's court
    through dreadful shades of ever-glooming night,
    i saw more sights than thousand tongues can tell
    or pens can write or mortal hearts can think.
    three ways there were: that on the right hand side

    where thou shalt see the author of thy death,
    don balthazar, the prince of portingal,
    depriv'd of life by bel-imperia:
    here sit we down to see the mystery,
    and serve for chorus in this tragedy.



[act i. scene 1.]
                [the spanish court]

                enter spanish king, general, castille, hieronimo.

  king.  now say, lord general: how fares our camp?

  gen.  all well, my sovereign liege, except some few
    that are deceas'd by fortune of the war.

  king.  but what portends thy cheerful countenance
    and posting to our presence thus in haste?
    speak, man:  hath fortune given us victory?

  gen.  victory, my liege, and that with little loss.

  king.  our portugals will pay us tribute then?

  gen.  tribute, and wonted homage therewithal.

  king.  the

  king.  thanks to my loving brother of castille.
    but, general, unfold in brief discourse
    your form of battle and your war's success,
    that, adding all the pleasure of thy news
    unto the height of former happiness,
    with deeper wage and gentle dignity
    we may reward thy blissful chivalry.

  gen.  where spain and portingal do jointly knit
    their frontiers, leaning on each other's bound,
    there met our armies in the proud array:
    both furnish'd well, both full of hope and f

    friendship and hardy valour join'd in one
    prick'd forth horatio, our knight-marshall's son,
    to challenge forth that prince in single fight.
    not long between these twain the fight endur'd,
    but straight the prince was beaten from his horse
    and forc'd to yield him prisoner to his foe.
    when he was taken, all the rest fled,
    and our carbines pursu'd them to death,
    till, phoebus waning to the western deep,
    our trumpeters were charg'd to sound retreat.

  king.  thanks, good lord general, for these good news!
    and, for some argument of more to come,
    take this and wear it for thy sovereign's sake.

                  give him his chain.

    but tell me now:  hast thou confirm'd a peace?

  gen.  no peace, my liege, but peace conditional,
    that, if with homage tribute be well paid,
    the fury of your forces will be stay'd.
    and to this peace their viceroy hath subscrib'd,

                  give the king a paper.

  king.  these words, these deeds become thy person well.
    but now, knight-marshall, frolic with thy king,
    for 'tis thy son that wins this battle's prize.

  hiero.  long may he live to serve my sovereign liege!
    and soon decay unless he serve my liege!

                  a trumpet afar off.

  king.  nor thou nor he shall die without reward.
    what means this warning of this trumpet's sound?

  gen.  this tells me that your grace's men of war,
    such as war's fortune hath reserv'd from death,
    come marching on towards your royal seat,
    to show themselves before your majesty;
    for so gave i in charge at my depart.
    whereby by demonstration shall appear
    that all, except three hundred or few more,
    are safe return'd and by their foes enrich'd.

                  they enter and pass by.

    was that the warlike prince of portingal
    that by our nephew was in triumph led?

  gen.  it was, my liege, the prince of portingal.

  king.  but what was he that on the other side
    held him by th' arm as partner of the prize?

  hiero.  that was my son, my gracious sovereign;
    of whom though from his tender infancy
    my loving thoughts did never hope but well,
    he never pleasd his father's eyes till now,
    nor fill'd my heart with overcloying joys.

  king.  go, let them march once more about these walls,
    that staying them we may confer and talk
    with our brave prisoner and his double guard.

    hieoronimo, it greatly pleaseth us
    that in our victory thou have a share
    by virtue of thy worthy son's exploit.

                  enter again.

    bring hither the young prince of portingal!
    the rest march on, but, ere they be dismiss'd,
    we will bestow on every soldier
    two ducats, and on every leader ten,
    that they may know our largesse welcomes them.

                  exeunt all [the army] but bal[thazar],
                  lor[enzo], and hor[atio].

  king.  welcome, don balthazar!  welcome nephew!
    and thou, horatio, thou art welcome too!
    young prince, although thy father's hard misdeeds
    in keeping back the tribute that he owes
    deserve but evil measure at our hands,
    yet shalt thou know that spain is honourable.

  balt.  the trespass that my father made in peace
    is now controll'd by fortune of the wars;
    and cards once dealt, it boots not ask why so.
    his men are slain,--a weakening to his realm;
    his colours seiz

'd,--a blot unto his name;
    his son distress'd,--a corsive to his heart;
    these punishments may clear his late offence.

  king.  aye, balthazar, if he observe this truce,
    our peace will grow the stronger for these wars.
    meanwhile live thou, though not in liberty,
    yet free from bearing any servile yoke;
    for in our hearing thy deserts were great.
    and in our sight thyself art gracious.

  balt.  and i shall study to deserve this grace.

  king.  but tell me,--for their holding makes me doubt:
    to which of these twain art thou prisoner?

  lor.  to me, my liege.

  hor.                   to me, my sovereign.

  lor.  this hand first took his courser by the reins.

  hor.  but first my lance did put him from his horse.

  lor.  i seiz'd the weapon and enjoy'd it first.

  hor.  but first i forc'd him lay his weapons down.

  king. let go his arm, upon my privilege!

                  let him go.

    say, worthy prince:  to whether

r gave me strokes;
    he promis'd life, this other threaten'd death;
    he won my love, this other conquer'd me;
    and, truth to say, i yield myself to both.

  hiero.  but that i know your grace is just and wise,
    and might seem partial in this difference,
    enforc'd by nature and by law of arms,
    my tongue should plead for young horatio's right.
    he hunted well that was a lion's death,
    not he that in a garment wore his skin;
    so hares may pull dead lions by the beard.

  king.  content thee, marshall; thou shalt have no wrong,
    and for thy sake thy son shall want to right.
    will both abide the censure of my doom?

  lor.  i crave no better than your grace awards.

  hor.  nor i, although i sit beside my right.

  king.  then by judgment thus your strife shall end:
    you both deserve and both shall have reward.
    nephew, thou took'st his weapons and his horse:
    his weapons and his horse are thy reward.
    horatio, thou did'st force him first to yield:

e sum as you shall both agree.
    but, nephew, thou shalt have the prince in guard,
    for thine estate best fitteth such a guest;
    horatio's house were small for all his train.
    yet, in regard thy substance passeth his,
    and that just guerdon may befall desert,
    to him we yield the armour of the prince.
    how likes don balthazar of this device?

  balt.  right well, my liege, if this proviso were:
    that don horatio bear us company,
    whom i admire and love for chivalry.

  king.  horatio, leave him not that loves thee so.
    now let us hence, to see our soldiers paid,
    and feast our prisoner as our friendly guest.

                  exeunt.

    but i'll now wear it till thy blood be spilt.

  alex.  vouchsafe, dread sovereign, to hear me speak!

  vice.  away with him!  his sight is second hell!
    keep him till we determine his death.
    if balthazar be dead, he shall not live.

                 [they take him out.]

    villuppo, follow us for thy reward.

                 exit vice[roy].

  villup.  thus have i with an envious forged tale
    deceiv'd the king, betray'd mine enemy,
    and hope for guerdon of my villainy.



[act i.  scene 3.]

                [spain: the palace]

                enter horatio and bel-imperia.

  bel.  signior horatio, this is the place and hour
    wherein i must entreat thee to relate
    the circumstance of don andrea's death,
    who living was my garland's sweetest flower,
    and in his death hath buried my delights.

  hor.  for love of him and service to yourself,
    i'll not refuse this heavy doleful charge
 
 ___________________________
 
    their hearts were great, their clamours menacing,
    their strength alike, their strokes both dangerous;
    but wrathful nemesis, that wicked power,
    envying at andrea's praise and worth,
    cut short his life to end his praise and worth.
    she, she herself, disguis'd in armour's mask,
    as pallas was before proud pergamus,
    brought in a fresh supply of halberdiers,
    which punch'd his horse and ding'd him to the ground.
    then young don balthazar, with ruthless rage,
    taking advantage of his foe's distress,
    did finish what his halberdiers begun;
    and left not till andrea's life was done.
    then, though too late, incens'd with just remorse,
    i with my band set forth against the prince,
    and brought him prisoner from his halberdiers.

  bel.  would thou hadst slain him that so slew my love!
    but then was don andrea's carcass lost?

  hor.  no; that was it for which i chiefly strove,
    nor stepp'd i back till i recover'd him.
    i took him up, and

 still!
    for, had he liv'd, he would have kept it still,
    and worn it for his bel-imperia's sake;
    for 'twas my favour at his last depart.
    but now wear thou it both for him and me;
    for, after him, thou hast deserv'd it best.
    but, for thy kindness in his life and death,
    be sure, while bel-imperia's life endures,
    she will be don horatio's thankful friend.

  hor.  and, madame, don horatio will not slack
    humbly to serve fair bel-imperia.
    but now, if your good liking stand thereto,
    i'll crave your pardon to go seek the prince;
    for so the duke, your father, gave me charge.

                exit.

  bel.  aye, go, horatio; leave me here alone,
    for solitude best fits my cheerless mood.--
    yet what avails to wail andreas death,
    from whence horatio proves my second love?
    had he not lov'd andrea as he did,
    he could not sit in bel-imperia's thoughts.
    but how can love find harbour in my breast,
    till i revenge the death of my belov

  bel.  thanks, good horatio; take it for thy pains.

                [bel-imperia exits.]

  bal.  signior horatio stoop'd in happy time!

  hor.  i reap'd more grace that i deserv'd or hop'd.

  lor.  my lord, be not dismay'd for what is past;
    you know that women oft are humorous:
    these clouds will overblow with little wind;
    let me alone, i'll scatter them myself.
    meanwhile let us devise to spend the time
    in some delightful sports and revelling.

  hor.  the king, my lords, is coming hither straight
    to feast the portingal ambassador;
    things were in readiness before i came.

  bal.  then here it fits us to attend the king,
    to welcome hither our ambassador,
    and learn my father and my country's health.

                enter the banquet, trumpets, the king,
                and ambassador.

  king.  see, lord ambassador, how spain entreats
    their prisoner balthazar, thy viceroy's son:
    we pleasure more in kindness than in wars.

  bal. [aside]  so am i, slain by beauty's tyranny!--
    you see, my lord, how balthazar is slain:
    i frolic with the duke of castille's son,
    wrapp'd every hour in pleasures of the court,
    and grac'd with favours of his majesty.

  king.  put off your greetings till our feast be done;
    now come and sit with us, and taste our cheer.

                sit to the banquet.

    sit down, young prince, you are our second guest;
    brother, sit down; and nephew, take your place.
    signior horatio, wait thou upon our cup,
    for well thou hast deserved to be honour'd.
    now, lordings, fall too: spain is portugal,
    and portugal is spain; we both are friends;
    tribute is paid, and we enjoy our right.

hieronimo, our marshall?
    he promis'd us, in honour of our guest,
    to grace our banquet with some pompous jest.

                enter hieronimo with a drum, three knights,
                each with scutcheon; then he fetches three
                kings; they take their crowns and them
                captive.

    hieronimo, this makes content mine eye,
    although i sound not well the mystery.

  hiero.  the first arm'd knight that hung his scutcheon up

                he takes the scutcheon and gives it to
                the king.

    was english robert, earle of gloucester,
    who, when king stephen bore sway in albion,
    arriv'd with five and twenty thousand men
    in portingal, and, by success of war,
    enforc'd the king, then

    to bear the yoke of the english monarchy.

  king.  my lord of portingal, by this you see
    that which may comfort both your king and you,
    and make your late discomfort seem the less.
    but say, hieronimo:  what was the next?

  hiero.  the second knight that hung his scutcheon up

                he doth as he did before.

    was edmond, earle of kent in albion.
    when english richard wore the diadem,
    he came likewise and razed lisbon walls,
    and took the king of portingal in fight,--
    for which, and other such service done,
    he after was created duke of york.

  king.  this is another special argument
    that portingal may deign to bear our yoke,
    when it by little england hath been yok'd.
    but now, hieronimo, what were the last?

  hiero.  the third and last, not least in our account,

                doing as before.

    was, as the rest, a valiant englishman,
    brave john of gaunt, the duke of lancaster,
    as by his scutcheon pl

ainly may appear:
    he with a puissant army came to spain
    and took our king of castille prisoner.

  ambass.  this is an argument for our viceroy
    that spain may not insult for her success,
    since english warriors likewise conquer'd spain
    and made them bow their knees to albion.

  king.  hieronimo, i drink to thee for this device,
    which hath pleas'd both the ambassador and me:
    pledge me, hieronimo, if thou love the king!

                takes the cup of horatio.

    my lord, i fear we sit but over-long,
    unless our dainties were more delicate,--
    but welcome are you to the best we have.
    now let us in, that you may be dispatch'd;
    i think our council is already set.

                exeunt omnes.

                [chorus.]

    return we now into your father's sight;
    dang'rous suspicion waits on our delight.

    shall send thy soul into eternal night!

  king.  brother of castille, to the prince's love
    what says your daughter bel-imperia?

  cip.  although she coy it, as becomes her kind,
    and yet dissemble that she loves the prince,
    i doubt not, aye, but she will stoop in time;
    and, were she froward,--which she will not be,--
    yet herein shall she follow my advice,
    which is to love him or forgo my love.

    in celebration of the nuptial day,--
    and let himself determine of the time.

  king.  commend me to the king; and so, farewell!
    but where's prince balthazar, to take his leave?

  ambass.  that is perform'd already, my good lord.

  king.  amongst the rest of what you have in charge,
    the prince's ransom must not be forgot:
    that's none of mine, but his that took him prisoner,--
    and well his forwardness deserves reward:
    it was horatio, our knight-marshall's son.

  king.  now, brother, you must make some little pains
    to win fair bel-imperia from her will;
    young virgins must be ruled by their friends.
    the prince is amiable, and loves her well;
    if she neglect him and forgo his love,
    she both will wrong her own estate and ours.
    therefore, whiles i do entertain the prince
    with greatest pleasure that our court affords,
    endeavor you to win your daughter's thought.
    if she give back, all this will come to naught.

                [the portuguese court.]

                enter viceroy of portingal, nobles, alexandro, villuppo.

  viceroy.  infortunate condition of kings,
    seated amidst so many helpless doubts!
    first, we are plac'd upon extremest height,
    and oft supplanted with exceeding hate,
    but ever subject to the wheel of chance;

  lor.  i do, my lord, and joy to see the same.

  cas.  and know'st thou why this meeting is?

  lor.  for her, my lord, whom balthazar doth love,
    and to confirm their promis'd marriage.

  cas.  she is thy sister.

  lor.                  who?  bel-imperia?
    aye, my gracious lord, and this is the day

  cas.  i tell thee, son, myself have heard it said,

    then i'll be gone; i thank you for't!

  cas.  nay, stay, hieronimo; go call him, son.

  lor.  hieronimo, my father craves a word with you.

  hiero.  with me, sir?  why, my lord, i thought you
    had done.

  lor.  [aside]  no; would he had!

  cas.                  hieronimo, i hear
    you find yourself aggrieved at my son,
    because you have not access unto the king,
    and say 'tis he that intercepts your suits.

  hiero.  why, is not this a miserable thing, my lord?

  cas.  hieronimo, i hope you have no cause,
    and would be loath that one of your deserts
    should once have reason to suspect my son,
    considering how i think of you myself.

  hiero.  your son lorenzo?  whom, my noble lord?

    she hath my heart, but you, my lord, have hers.

  lor.  but now, hieronimo, or never
    we are to entreat your help.

  hie.           my help?
   why, my good lords, assure yourselves of me;
    for you have giv'n me cause,--
    aye, by my faith, have you!

  bal.                         it pleased you

    to entertain my father with the like,
    or any such like pleasing motion,
    assure yourself it would content them well.

    it was my chance to write a tragedy,--

    which, long forgot, i found this other day.
    nor would your lordships favour me so much
    as but to grace me with your acting it,
    i mean each one of you to play a part.
    assure you it will prove most passing strange
    and wondrous plausible to that assembly.

  bal.  what, would you have us play a tragedy?

  hiero.  why, nero thought it no disparagement,
    and kings and emperors have ta'en delight
    to make experience of their wit in plays!

  lor.  nay, be not angry, good hieronimo;
    the prince but ask'd a question.

  bal.  in faith, hieronimo, and you be in earnest,
    i'll make one.

  lor.          and i another.

  hiero.  now, my good lord, could you entreat,
    your sister, bel-imperia, to make one,--
    for what's a play without a woman in it?

    and as for me, my lords, i'll look to one,
    and with the ransom that the viceroy sent
    so furnish and perform this tragedy
    as all the world shall say hieronimo
    was liberal in gracing of it so.

  bal. hieronimo, methinks a comedy were better.

  hiero.  a comedy?  fie!  comedies are fit for common wits;
    but to present a kingly troupe withal,
    give me a stately-written tragedy,--
    tragedia cothurnata, fitting kings,
    containing matter, and not common things!
    my lords, all this our sport must be perform'd,
    as fitting for the first night's revelling.
    the italian tragedians were so sharp
    of wit that in one hour's meditation
    they would perform any-thing in action.

  lor.  and well it may, for i have seen the like
    in paris, 'mongst the french tragedians.
