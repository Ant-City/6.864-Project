rnment money, you ain’t got no
kick coming, eh, perrault?”

perrault grinned. considering that the price of dogs had been boomed
skyward by the unwonted demand, it was not an unfair sum for so fine
an animal. the canadian government would be no loser, nor would its
despatches travel the slower. perrault knew dogs, and when he looked at
buck he knew that he was one in a thousand--“one in ten t’ousand,” he
commented mentally.

buck saw money pass between them, and was not surprised when curly, a
good-natured newfoundland, and he were led away by the little weazened
man. that was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater, and as
curly and he looked at receding seattle from the deck of the narwhal, it
was the last he saw of the warm southland. curly and he were taken below
by perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant called francois.
perrault was a french-canadian, and swarthy; but francois was a
french-canadian half-breed, and twice as swarthy. they were a new kind
of men t

o buck (of which he was destined to see many more), and while
he developed no affection for them, he none the less grew honestly to
respect them. he speedily learned that perrault and francois were fair
men, calm and impartial in administering justice, and too wise in the
way of dogs to be fooled by dogs.

in the ‘tween-decks of the narwhal, buck and curly joined two other
dogs. one of them was a big, snow-white fellow from spitzbergen who had
been brought away by a whaling captain, and who had later accompanied
a geological survey into the barrens. he was friendly, in a treacherous
sort of way, smiling into one’s face the while he meditated some
underhand trick, as, for instance, when he stole from buck’s food at the
first meal. as buck sprang to punish him, the lash of francois’s whip
sang through the air, reaching the culprit first; and

nothing remained
to buck but to recover the bone. that was fair of francois, he decided,
and the half-breed began his rise in buck’s estimation.

the other dog made no advances, nor received any; also, he did not
attempt to steal from the newcomers. he was a gloomy, morose fellow, and
he showed curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone, and
further, that there would be trouble if he were not left alone. “dave”
 he was called, and he ate and slept, or yawned between times, and took
interest in nothing, not even when the narwhal crossed queen charlotte
sound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing possessed. when
buck and curly grew excited, half wild with fear, he raised his head as
though annoyed, favored them with an incurious glance, yawned, and went
to sleep again

rest, nor a moment’s safety. all
was confusion and action, and every moment life and limb were in peril.
there was imperative need to be constantly alert; for these dogs and men
were not town dogs and men. they were savages, all of them, who knew no
law but the law of club and fang.

he had never seen dogs fight as these wolfish creatures fought, and his
first experience taught him an unforgetable lesson. it is true, it was
a vicarious experience, else he would not have lived to profit by it.
curly was the victim. they were camped near the log store, where she, in
her friendly way, made advances to a husky dog the size of a full-grown
wolf, though not half so large as she. there was no warning, only a leap
in like a flash, a metallic clip of teeth, a leap out equally swift, and
curly’s face was ripped open from eye to jaw.

it was the wolf manner of fighting, to strike and leap away; but there
was more to it than this. thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and
surrounded the combatant

s in an intent and silent circle. buck did not
comprehend that silent intentness, nor the eager way with which they
were licking their chops. curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again
and leaped aside. he met her next rush with his chest, in a peculiar
fashion that tumbled her off her feet. she never regained them, this
was what the onlooking huskies had waited for. they closed in upon her,
snarling and yelping, and she was buried, screaming with agony, beneath
the bristling mass of bodies.

so sudden was it, and so unexpected, that buck was taken aback. he saw
spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing; and he saw

ancois, swinging an axe, spring into the mess of dogs. three men
with clubs were helping him to scatter them. it did not take long. two
minutes from the time curly went down, the last of her assailants were
clubbed off. but she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody, trampled
snow, almost literally torn to pieces, the swart half-breed standing
over her and cursing horribly. the scene often came back to buck to
trouble him in his sleep. so that was the way. no fair play. once down,
that was the end of you. well, he would see to it that he never went
down. spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again, and from that moment
buck hated him with a bitter and d

eathless hatred.

before he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing
of curly, he received another shock. francois fastened upon him an
arrangement of straps and buckles. it was a harness, such as he had seen
the grooms put on the horses at home. and as he had seen horses work,
so he was set to work, hauling francois on a sled to the forest that
fringed the valley, and returning with a load of firewood. though his
dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal, he was too
wise to rebel. he buckled down with a will and did his best, though
it was all new and

ry, so that when he bristled and showed his teeth they got
out of his way.

best of all, perhaps, he loved to lie near the fire, hind legs crouched
under him, fore legs stretched out in front, head raised, and eyes
blinking dreamily at the flames. sometimes he thought of judge miller’s
big house in the sun-kissed santa clara valley, and of the cement
swimming-tank, and ysabel, the mexican hairless, and toots, the japanese
pug; but oftener he remembered the man in the red sweater, the death of
curly, the great fight with spitz, and the good things he had eaten or
would like to eat. he was not homesick. the sunland was very dim and
distant, and such memories had no power over him. far more potent were
the memories of his heredity that gave things he had never seen before
a seeming familiarity; the instincts (which were but the memories of
his ancestors become habits) which had lapsed in later days, and still
later, in him, quickened and become alive again.

sometimes as he crouched there, b
