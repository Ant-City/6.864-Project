no sense.
 'what was your outfit?' said the colonel. he coughed and coughed. every time he
inhaled his lungs rattled like greasy paper bags.
 billy couldn't remember the outfit he was from.
 'you from the four-fifty-first?'
 'four-fifty-first what?' said billy.
 there was a silence. 'infantry regiment,' said the colonel at last.
 'oh,' said billy pilgrim.
 there was another long silence, with the colonel dying and dying, drowning where he
stood. and then he cried out wetly, 'it's me, boys! it's wild bob!' that is what he had
always wanted his troops to call him: 'wild bob.'
 none of the people who could hear him were actually from his regiment, except for
roland weary, and weary wasn't listening. all weary could think of was the agony in
his own feet.
 but the colonel imagined that he was addressing his beloved troops for the last time,
and he told them that they had nothing to be ashamed of, that there were dead germans
all over the battlefield who wished to god that they had never heard of t

he four-fiftyfirst.
he said that after the war he was going to have a regimental reunion in his home
town, which was cody, wyoming. he was going to barbecue whole steers.
 he said all this while staring into billy's eyes. he made the inside of poor bill's skull
echo with balderdash. 'god be with you, boys!' he said, and that echoed and echoed. and
then he said. 'if you're ever in cody, wyoming, just ask for wild bob!' i was there. so
was my old war buddy, bernard v. o'hare.
 billy pilgrim was packed into a boxcar with many other privates. he and roland
weary were separated. weary was packed into another car in the same train.
 there were narrow ventilators at the comers of the car, under the eaves. billy stood by
one of these, and, as the crowd pressed against him, he climbed part way up a diagonal
corner brace to make more room. he placed his eyes on a level with the ventilator, so he
could see another tr

 register of the german language. one of them saw billy's face at the ventilator. he
wagged a finger at him in affectionate warning, telling him to be a good boy.
 the americans across the way told the guards again about the dead man on their car.
the guards got a stretcher out of their own cozy car, opened the dead man's car and went
inside. the dead man's car wasn't crowded at all. there were just six live colonels in
there-and one dead one.
 the germans carried the corpse out. the corpse was wild bob. so it goes.
 during the night, some of the locomotives began to tootle to one another, and then to
move. the locomotive and the last car of each train were marked with a striped banner of
orange and black, indicating that the train was not fair game for airplanes that it was
carrying prisoners of war.
 the war was nearly over. the locomotives began to move east in late december. the
war would end in may. german prisons everywhere were absolutely full, and there was
no longer any food for the p

le and decent. they would do well to read this book and
ponder the fate of dresden, where 135,000 people died as the result of an air attack with
conventional weapons. on the night of march 9th, 1945, an air attack on tokyo by
american heavy bombers, using incendiary and high explosive bombs, caused the death
of 83,793 people. the atom bomb dropped on hiroshima killed 71,379 people.
 so it goes.
 'if you're ever in cody, wyoming,' said billy pilgrim behind his white linen screens,
'just ask for wild bob.'
 lily rumfoord shuddered, went on pretending to read the harry truman thing.
 billy's daughter barbara came in later that day. she was all doped up, had the same
glassy-eyed look that poor old edgar derby wore just before he was shot in dresden.
doctors had given her pills so she could continue to function, even though her father was
broken and her mother was dead.
 so it goes.
 she was accompanied by a doctor and a nurse. her brother robert was flying home
from a battlefield in vietnam. 'dad

r, and there were other people up there, waiting to go in. they were literary critics,
and they thought billy was one, too. they were going to discuss whether the novel was
dead or not. so it goes.
 billy took his seat with the others around a golden oak table, with a microphone all his
own. the master of ceremonies asked him his name and what paper he was from. billy
said he was from the ilium gazette.
 he was nervous and happy. 'if you're ever in cody, wyoming,' he told himself, 'just
ask for wild bob.'
 billy put his hand up at the very first part of the program but he wasn't called on right
away. others got in ahead of him. one of them said that it would be a nice time to bury
the novel, now that a virginian, one hundred years after appomattox, had written uncle
tom's cabin. another one said that people couldn't read well enough anymore to turn
print into exciting situations in their skulls, so that authors had to do what norman mailer
did, which was to perform in public what he had writte

went into the cockpit for a tool, came back with a beer-can opener. he used it to
pry out the tray.
 there were only six other passengers. they spoke many languages. they were having
nice times, too. east germany was down below, and the lights were on. i imagined
dropping bombs on those lights, those villages and cities and towns.
 o'hare and i had never expected to make any money-and here we were now,
extremely well-to-do.
 'if you're ever in cody, wyoming,' i said to him lazily, 'just ask for wild bob.'
 o'hare had a little notebook with him, and printed in the back of it were postal rates
and airline distances and the altitudes of famous mountains and other key facts about the
world. he was looking up the population of dresden, which wasn't in the notebook, when
he came across this, which he gave me to read:
 on an average, 324,000 new babies are born into the world every day. during that
same day, 10,000 persons, in an average, will have starved to death or died from
malnutrition. so it go
