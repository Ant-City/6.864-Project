ended from his waist, and moistening them in water, applied them
to the inflamed part, stooping over it at the same time, and either
whispering a spell, or having a little confidential chat with some
imaginary demon located in the calf of my leg. my limb was now swathed
in leafy bandages, and grateful to providence for the cessation of
hostilities, i was suffered to rest.

mehevi shortly after rose to depart; but before he went he spoke
authoritatively to one of the natives whom he addressed as kory-kory;
and from the little i could understand of what took place, pointed
him out to me as a man whose peculiar business thenceforth would be to
attend upon my person. i am not certain that i comprehended as much as
this at the time, but the subsequent conduct of my trusty body-servant
fully assured me that such must have been the case.

i could not but be amused at the manner in which the chief addressed me
upon this occasion, talking to me for at least fifteen or twenty minutes
as calmly as if i co

thus much for the house, and its appurtenances; and it will be readily
acknowledged that a more commodious and appropriate dwelling for the
climate and the people could not possibly be devised. it was cool, free
to admit the air, scrupulously clean, and elevated above the dampness
and impurities of the ground.

but now to sketch the inmates; and here i claim for my tried servitor
and faithful valet kory-kory the precedence of a first description. as
his character will be gradually unfolded in the course of my narrative,
i shall for the present content myself with delineating his personal
appearance. kory-kory, though the most devoted and best natured
serving-man in the world, was, alas! a hideous object to look upon. he
was some twenty-five years of age, and about six feet in height, robust
and well made, and of the most extraordinary aspect. his head was
carefully shaven with the exception of two

circular spots, about the
size of a dollar, near the top of the cranium, where the hair, permitted
to grow of an amazing length, was twisted up in two prominent knots,
that gave him the appearance of being decorated with a pair of horns.
his beard, plucked out by the root from every other part of his face,
was suffered to droop in hairy pendants, two of which garnished his
under lip, and an equal number hung from the extremity of his chin.

kory-kory, with a view of improving the handiwork of nature, and
perhaps prompted by a desire to add to the engaging expression of
his countenance, had seen fit to embellish his face with three broad
longitudinal stripes of tattooing, which, like those country roads that
go straight forward in defiance of all obstacles, crossed his nasal
organ, descended into the hollow of his eyes, and even skirted the
borders of his mouth. each completely spanned his physiognomy; one
extending in a line with his eyes,

timentally from behind the grated bars of a
prison window; whilst the entire body of my savage valet, covered all
over with representations of birds and fishes, and a variety of most
unaccountable-looking creatures, suggested to me the idea of a pictorial
museum of natural history, or an illustrated copy of ‘goldsmith’s
animated nature.’

but it seems really heartless in me to write thus of the poor islander,
when i owe perhaps to his unremitting attentions the very existence i
now enjoy. kory-kory, i mean thee no harm in what i say in regard to
thy outward adornings; but they were a little curious to my unaccustomed
sight, and therefore i dilate upon them. but to underrate or forget thy
faithful services is something i could never be guilty of, even in the
giddiest moment of my life.

the father of my attached follower was a native of gigantic frame, and
had once possessed prodigious physical powers; but the lofty form was
now yielding to the inroads of time, though the hand of disease s

neighbouring groves, as if about to give a hostile meeting to some
cannibal knight. but he would soon return again, and hiding his weapon
under the projecting eaves of the house, and rolling his clumsy trinkets
carefully in a piece of tappa, would resume his more pacific operations
as quietly as if he had never interrupted them.

but despite his eccentricities, marheyo was a most paternal and
warm-hearted old fellow, and in this particular not a little resembled
his son kory-kory. the mother of the latter was the mistress of the
family, and a notable housewife, and a most industrious old lady she
was. if she did not understand the art of making jellies, jams, custard,
tea-cakes, and such like trashy affairs, she was profoundly skilled in
the mysteries of preparing ‘amar’, ‘poee-poee’, and ‘kokoo’, with other
substantial matters.

she was a genuine busy-body; bustling about the house like a country
landlady at an unexpected arrival; for ever giving the young

 among the calabashes. sometimes she might have been
seen squatting upon her haunches in front of a huge wooden basin, and
kneading poee-poee with terrific vehemence, dashing the stone pestle
about as if she would shiver the vessel into fragments; on other
occasions, galloping about the valley in search of a particular kind
of leaf, used in some of her recondite operations, and returning home,
toiling and sweating, with a bundle of it, under which most women would
have sunk.

to tell the truth, kory-kory’s mother was the only industrious person
in all the valley of typee; and she could not have employed herself more
actively had she been left an exceedingly muscular and destitute widow,
with an inordinate ate supply of young children, in the bleakest part
of the civilized world. there was not the slightest necessity for the
greater portion of the labour performed by the old lady: but she seemed
to work from some irresistible impulse; her limbs continually swaying to
and fro, as if there were

passionately fond of flowers, and never
wearied of decorating their persons with them; a lovely trait in their
character, and one that ere long will be more fully alluded to.

though in my eyes, at least, fayaway was indisputably the loveliest
female i saw in typee, yet the description i have given of her will in
some measure apply to nearly all the youthful portion of her sex in the
valley. judge ye then, reader, what beautiful creatures they must have
been.

me lie down, covered me with a large robe of tappa, at the same time
looking approvingly upon me, and exclaiming ‘ki-ki, nuee nuee, ah! moee

this sentiment i did not pretend to question; for deprived of sleep for
several preceding nights, and the pain of my limb having much abated, i
now felt inclined to avail myself of the opportunity afforded me.

the next morning, on waking, i found kory-kory stretched out on one side
of me, while my companion lay upon the other. i felt sensibly refreshed
after a night of sound repose, and immediately agreed to the proposition
of my valet that i should repair to the water and wash, although
dreading the suffering that the exertion might produce. from this
apprehension, however, i was quickly relieved; for kory-kory, leaping
from the pi-pi, and then backing himself up against it, like a porter
in readiness to shoulder a trunk, with loud vociferations

ersing with one
another in the most animated manner. they reminded one of a group of
idlers gathered about the door of a village tavern when the equipage
of some distinguished traveller is brought round previously to his
departure. as soon as i clasped my arms about the neck of the devoted
fellow, and he jogged off with me, the crowd--composed chiefly of young
girls and boys--followed after, shouting and capering with infinite
glee, and accompanied us to the banks of the stream.

on gaining it, kory-kory, wading up to his hips in the water, carried me
half way across, and deposited me on a smooth black stone which rose a
few inches above the surface. the amphibious rabble at our heels plunged
in after us, and climbing to the summit of the grass-grown rocks with
which the bed of the brook was here and there broken, waited curiously
to witness our morning ablutions.

somewhat embarrassed by the presence of the female portion of the
company, and feeling my cheeks burning with bashful timidity, i f

a primitive basin by joining my hands together, and cooled my blushes
in the water it contained; then removing my frock, bent over and washed
myself down to my waist in the stream. as soon as kory-kory comprehended
from my motions that this was to be the extent of my performance, he
appeared perfectly aghast with astonishment, and rushing towards me,
poured out a torrent of words in eager deprecation of so limited an
operation, enjoining me by unmistakable signs to immerse my whole body.
to this i was forced to consent; and the honest fellow regarding me as a
froward, inexperienced child, whom it was his duty to serve at the risk
of offending, lifted me from the rocks, and tenderly bathed my

forth at every frolicsome incident. on the afternoon of the day that i
took my first bath in the valley, we received another visit from mehevi.
the noble savage seemed to be in the same pleasant mood, and was quite
as cordial in his manner as before. after remaining about an hour, he
rose from the mats, and motioning to leave the house, invited toby and
myself to accompany him. i pointed to my leg; but mehevi in his turn
pointed to kory-kory, and removed that objection; so, mounting upon the
faithful fellow’s shoulders again--like the old man of the sea astride
of sindbad--i followed after the chief.

the nature of the route we now pursued struck me more forcibly than
anything i had yet seen, as illustrating the indolent disposition of
the islanders. the path was obviously the most beaten one in the
valley, several others leading from each side into it, and perhaps for
successive generations it had formed the principal avenue of

bstacles with a wide circuit, the path wound along;--one moment
climbing over a sudden eminence smooth with continued wear, then
descending on the other side into a steep glen, and crossing the flinty
channel of a brook. here it pursued the depths of a glade, occasionally
obliging you to stoop beneath vast horizontal branches; and now you
stepped over huge trunks and boughs that lay rotting across the track.

such was the grand thoroughfare of typee. after proceeding a little
distance along it--kory-kory panting and blowing with the weight of
his burden--i dismounted from his back, and grasping the long spear of
mehevi in my hand, assisted my steps over the numerous obstacles of
the road; preferring this mode of advance to one which, from the
difficulties of the way, was equally painful to myself and my wearied
servitor.

our journey was soon at an end; for, scaling a sudden height, we came
abruptly upon the place of our destination. i wish that it were possible
to sketch in words this spot as

these repulsive-looking creatures appeared to have lost the use of their
lower limbs altogether; sitting upon the floor cross-legged in a state
of torpor. they never heeded us in the least, scarcely looking conscious
of our presence, while mehevi seated us upon the mats, and kory-kory
gave utterance to some unintelligible gibberish.

in a few moments a boy entered with a wooden trencher of poee-poee; and
in regaling myself with its contents i was obliged again to submit to
the officious intervention of my indefatigable servitor. various other
dishes followed, the chief manifesting the most hospitable importunity
in pressing us to partake, and to remove all bashfulness on our part,
set us no despicable example in his own person.

the repast concluded, a pipe was lighted, whic

mouth, and yielding to its soporific influence, the quiet of the place,
and the deepening shadows of approaching night, my companion and i sank
into a kind of drowsy repose, while the chief and kory-kory seemed to be
slumbering beside us.

i awoke from an uneasy nap, about midnight, as i supposed; and, raising
myself partly from the mat, became sensible that we were enveloped
in utter darkness. toby lay still asleep, but our late companions had
disappeared. the only sound that interrupted the silence of the place
was the asthmatic breathing of the old men i have mentioned, who reposed
at a little distance from us. besides them, as well as i could judge,
there was no one else in the house.

sure, what else would the cannibals be
kicking up such a row about if it were not for that?’

‘oh, toby! have done with your jokes; this is no time for them;
something is about to happen, i feel confident.’

‘jokes, indeed?’ exclaimed toby indignantly. ‘did you ever hear me joke?
why, for what do you suppose the devils have been feeding us up in this
kind of style during the last three days, unless it were for something
that you are too much frightened at to talk about? look at that
kory-kory there!--has he not been stuffing you with his confounded
mushes, just in the way they treat swine before they kill them? depend
upon it, we will be eaten this blessed night, and there is the fire we
shall be roasted by.’

this view of the matter was not at all calculated to allay my
apprehensions, and i shuddered when i reflected that we were indeed at
the mercy of a tribe of cannibals, and that the dreadful contingency
to which toby had alluded was by no means removed beyond the bounds of

if they serve me up, they are welcome! but i say, tommo, you are not
going to eat any of that mess there, in the dark, are you? why, how can
you tell what it is?’

‘by tasting it, to be sure,’ said i, masticating a morsel that kory-kory
had just put in my mouth, ‘and excellently good it is, too, very much
like veal.’

‘a baked baby, by the soul of captain cook!’ burst forth toby, with
amazing vehemence; ‘veal? why there never was a calf on the island
till you landed. i tell you you are bolting down mouthfuls from a dead
happar’s carcass, as sure as you live, and no mistake!’

emetics and lukewarm water! what a sensation in the abdominal region!
sure enough, where could the fiends incarnate have obtained meat? but

resolved to satisfy myself at all hazards; and turning to mehevi, i soon
made the ready chief understand that i wished a light to be brought.
when the taper came, i gazed eagerly into the vessel, and recognized the
mutilated remains of a juvenile porker! ‘puarkee!’ exclaimed kory-kory,
looking complacently at the dish; and from that day to this i have never
forgotten that such is the designation of a pig in the typee lingo.

the next morning, after being again abundantly feasted by the hospitable
mehevi, toby and myself arose to depart. but the chief requested us to
postpone our intention. ‘abo, abo’ (wait, wait), he said and accordingly
we resumed our seats, while, assisted by the zealous kory-kory, he
appeared to be engaged in giving directions to a number of the nativ

astonished as i was at this exhibition, i could not avoid smiling at
its grotesque appearance, and the associations it naturally called
up. mehevi, it seemed, was bent on replenishing old marheyo’s larder,
fearful perhaps that without this precaution his guests might not fare
as well as they could desire.

as soon as i descended from the pi-pi, the procession formed anew,
enclosing us in its centre; where i remained part of the time, carried
by kory-kory, and occasionally relieving him from his burden by limping
along with spear. when we moved off in this order, the natives struck
up a musical recitative, which with various alternations, they continued
until we arrived at the place of our destination.

as we proceeded on our way, bands of young girls, darting from the
surrounding groves, hung upon our skirts, and accompanied us with shouts
of merriment and delight, which almost drowned the deep notes of the
recitative. on approaching old marhey

attempt to procure relief from nukuheva--perilous adventure of toby in
the happar mountains--eloquence of kory-kory

amidst these novel scenes a week passed away almost imperceptibly. the
natives, actuated by some mysterious impulse, day after day redoubled
their attentions to us. their manner towards us was unaccountable.
surely, thought i, they would not act thus if they meant us any harm.
but why this excess of deferential kindness, or what equivalent can they
imagine us capable of rendering them for it?

we were fairly puzzled. but despite the apprehensions i could not
dispel, the horrible character impu

swerable; but still i clung to the
belief that he might succeed in accomplishing the other part of my plan;
and at last i overcame his scruples, and he agreed to make the attempt.

as soon as we succeeded in making the natives understand our intention,
they broke out into the most vehement opposition to the measure, and
for a while i almost despaired of obtaining their consent. at the bare
thought of one of us leaving them, they manifested the most lively
concern. the grief and consternation of kory-kory, in particular, was
unbounded; he threw himself into a perfect paroxysm of gestures which
were intended to convey to us not only his abhorrence of nukuheva
and its uncivilized inhabitants, but also his astonishment that after
becoming acquainted with the enlightened typees, we should evince the
least desire to withdraw, even for a time, from their agreeable society.

however, i overbore his objections by appealing to my lameness; from
which i assured the natives i should speedily recover if tob

to pass in sleep, that i lay in the house, surrounded by its slumbering
inmates, and painfully affected by the strange silence which prevailed.
all at once i thought i heard a faint shout, as if proceeding from
some persons in the depth of the grove which extended in front of our
habitation.

the sounds grew louder and nearer, and gradually the whole valley rang
with wild outcries. the sleepers around me started to their feet in
alarm, and hurried outside to discover the cause of the commotion.
kory-kory, who had been the first to spring up, soon returned almost
breathless, and nearly frantic with the excitement under which he seemed
to be labouring. all that i could understand from him was that some
accident had happened to toby. apprehensive of some dreadful calamity,
i rushed out of the house, and caught sight of a tumultuous crowd, who,
with shrieks and lamentations, were just emerging from the grove
bearing in their arms some object, the sight of which produced all this
transport of sorrow

certained that the heart still beat. overjoyed at this, i
seized a calabash of water, and dashed its contents upon his face, then
wiping away the blood, anxiously examined the wound. it was about three
inches long, and on removing the clotted hair from about it, showed the
skull laid completely bare. immediately with my knife i cut away the
heavy locks, and bathed the part repeatedly in water.

in a few moments toby revived, and opening his eyes for a second--closed
them again without speaking. kory-kory, who had been kneeling beside me,
now chafed his limbs gently with the palms of his hands, while a young
girl at his head kept fanning him, and i still continued to moisten his
lips and brow. soon my poor comrade showed signs of animation, and i
succeeded in making him swallow from a cocoanut shell a few mouthfuls of
water.

old tinor now appeared, holding in her hand some simples she had
gathered, the juice of which she by signs besought me to squeeze into
the wound. having done so, i thought

their neighbours. they likewise dwelt upon the cannibal propensities of
the happars, a subject which they were perfectly aware could not fail
to alarm us; while at the same time they earnestly disclaimed all
participation in so horrid a custom. nor did they omit to call upon
us to admire the natural loveliness of their own abode, and the lavish
abundance with which it produced all manner of luxuriant fruits;
exalting it in this particular above any of the surrounding valleys.

kory-kory seemed to experience so heartfelt a desire to infuse into our
minds proper views on these subjects, that, assisted in his endeavours
by the little knowledge of the language we had acquired, he actually
made us comprehend a considerable part of what he said. to facilitate
our correct apprehension of his meaning, he at first condensed his ideas
into the smallest possible compass.

‘happar keekeeno nuee,’ he exclaimed, ‘nuee, nuee, ki ki
kannaka!--ah! owle motarkee!’ which signifies, ‘te
 
 ___________________________
 
ee wai--nuee, nuee poee-poee--nuee, nuee kokoo--ah!
nuee, nuee kiki--ah! nuee, nuee, nuee!’ which literally interpreted
as before, would imply, ‘ah, typee! isn’t it a fine place though!--no
danger of starving here, i tell you!--plenty of bread-fruit--plenty of
water--plenty of pudding--ah! plenty of everything! ah! heaps, heaps
heaps!’ all this was accompanied by a running commentary of signs and
gestures which it was impossible not to comprehend.

as he continued his harangue, however, kory-kory, in emulation of our
more polished orators, began to launch out rather diffusely into other
branches of his subject, enlarging probably upon the moral reflections
it suggested; and proceeded in such a strain of unintelligible and
stunning gibberish, that he actually gave me the headache for the rest
of the day.

in the course of a few days toby had recovered from the effects of
his adventure with the happar warriors; the wound on his head rapidly
healing under the vegetable treatment of the good tinor. less fortunate
than my companion however, i still continued to languish under a
complaint, the origin and nature of which were still a mystery. cut off
as i was from all intercourse with the civilized world, and feeling the

e me; knowing,
too, that so long as i remained in my present condition, it would
be impossible for me to leave the valley, whatever opportunity might
present itself; and apprehensive that ere long we might be exposed to
some caprice on the part of the islanders, i now gave up all hopes
of recovery, and became a prey to the most gloomy thoughts. a deep
dejection fell upon me, which neither the friendly remonstrances of
my companion, the devoted attentions of kory-kory nor all the soothing
influences of fayaway could remove.

one morning as i lay on the mats in the house, plunged in melancholy
reverie, and regardless of everything around me, toby, who had left me
about an hour, returned in haste, and with great glee told me to cheer
up and be of good heart; for he believed, from what was going on among
the natives, that there were boats approaching the bay.

these tidings operated upon me like magic. the hour of our deliverance
was at hand, and starting up, i

that
it was only at long intervals any such events occur.

when i thought of the length of time that might intervene before a
similar chance of escape would be presented, i bitterly lamented that
i had not the power of availing myself effectually of the present
opportunity.

from all that we could gather, it appeared that the natives were fearful
of arriving too late upon the beach, unless they made extraordinary
exertions. sick and lame as i was, i would have started with toby at
once, had not kory-kory not only refused to carry me, but manifested
the most invincible repugnance to our leaving the neighbourhood of the
house. the rest of the savages were equally opposed to our wishes, and
seemed grieved and astonished at the earnestness of my solicitations.
i clearly perceived that while my attendant avoided all appearance of
constraining my movements, he was nevertheless determined to thwart my
wishes. he seemed to me on this particular occasion, as well as often
afterwards, to be executing the

another, perspiring with his exertions, and bearing before him a
quantity of cocoanuts, who, fearful of being too late, heeded not the
fruit that dropped from his basket, and appeared solely intent upon
reaching his destination, careless how many of his cocoanuts kept
company with him.

in a short time the last straggler was seen hurrying on his way, and the
faint shouts of those in advance died insensibly upon the ear. our
part of the valley now appeared nearly deserted by its inhabitants,
kory-kory, his aged father, and a few decrepit old people, being all
that were left.

towards sunset the islanders in small parties began to return from
the beach, and among them, as they drew near to the house, i sought to
descry the form of my companion. but one after another they passed the
dwelling, and i caught no glimpse of him. supposing, however, that he
would soon appear with some of the members of the household, i quieted
my apprehensions, and waited patiently to see him advancing in company

d if at any time they were forced
to make some reply to my frequent inquiries on the subject, they would
uniformly denounce him as an ungrateful runaway, who had deserted
his friend, and taken himself off to that vile and detestable place
nukuheva.

but whatever might have been his fate, now that he was gone the natives
multiplied their acts of kindness and attention towards myself, treating
me with a degree of deference which could hardly have been surpassed had
i been some celestial visitant. kory-kory never for one moment left my
side, unless it were to execute my wishes. the faithful fellow, twice
every day, in the cool of the morning and in the evening, insisted upon
carrying me to the stream, and bathing me in its refreshing water.

frequently in the afternoon he would carry me to a particular part of
the stream, where the beauty of the scene produced a soothing influence
upon my mind. at this place the waters flowed between grassy banks,
planted with enormous bread-fruit trees, whose vas

med a leafy canopy; near the stream were several smooth
black rocks. one of these, projecting several feet above the surface
of the water, had upon its summit a shallow cavity, which, filled with
freshly-gathered leaves, formed a delightful couch.

here i often lay for hours, covered with a gauze-like veil of tappa,
while fayaway, seated beside me, and holding in her hand a fan woven
from the leaflets of a young cocoanut bough, brushed aside the insects
that occasionally lighted on my face, and kory-kory, with a view of
chasing away my melancholy, performed a thousand antics in the water
before us.

as my eye wandered along this romantic stream, it would fall upon the
half-immersed figure of a beautiful girl, standing in the transparent
water, and catching in a little net a species of diminutive shell-fish,
of which these people are extraordinarily fond. sometimes a chattering
group would be seated upon the edge of a low rock in the midst of the
brook, busily engaged in thinning and polishing t

he shells of cocoanuts,
by rubbing them briskly with a small stone in the water, an operation
which soon converts them into a light and elegant drinking vessel,
somewhat resembling goblets made of tortoise shell.

but the tranquillizing influence of beautiful scenery, and the
exhibition of human life under so novel and charming an aspect were not
my only sources of consolation.

every evening the girls of the house gathered about me on the mats, and
after chasing away kory-kory from my side--who nevertheless, retired
only to a little distance and watched their proceedings with the most
jealous attention--would anoint my whole body with a fragrant oil,
squeezed from a yellow root, previously pounded between a couple of
stones, and which in their language is denominated ‘aka’. and most
refreshing and agreeable are the juices of the ‘aka’, when applied to
ones, limbs by the soft palms of sweet nymphs, whose bright eyes are

with one end elevated at an angle of forty-five degrees, mounts astride
of it like an urchin about to gallop off upon a cane, and then grasping
the smaller one firmly in both hands, he rubs its pointed end slowly
up and down the extent of a few inches on the principal stick, until at
last he makes a narrow groove in the wood, with an abrupt termination
at the point furthest from him, where all the dusty particles which the
friction creates are accumulated in a little heap.

at first kory-kory goes to work quite leisurely, but gradually quickens
his pace, and waxing warm in the employment, drives the stick furiously
along the smoking channel, plying his hands to and fro with amazing
rapidity, the perspiration starting from every pore. as he approaches
the climax of his effort, he pants and gasps for breath, and his eyes
almost start from their sockets with the violence of his exertions. this
is the critical stage of the operation; all his previous labours
are vain if he cannot sustai

reluctant spark is produced. suddenly he stops, becoming perfectly
motionless. his hands still retain their hold of the smaller stick,
which is pressed convulsively against the further end of the channel
among the fine powder there accumulated, as if he had just pierced
through and through some little viper that was wriggling and struggling
to escape from his clutches. the next moment a delicate wreath of smoke
curls spirally into the air, the heap of dusty particles glows with
fire, and kory-kory, almost breathless, dismounts from his steed.

this operation appeared to me to be the most laborious species of work
performed in typee; and had i possessed a sufficient intimacy with the
language to have conveyed my ideas upon the subject, i should certainly
have suggested to the most influential of the natives the expediency of
establishing a college of vestals to be centrally located in the valley,
for the purpose of keeping alive the indispensable article of fire; so

delicious liquid soon bubbles round the fruit, and leaves it at last
just peeping above its surface.

this preparation is called ‘kokoo’, and a most luscious preparation it
is. the hobby-horse and the pestle and mortar were in great requisition
during the time i remained in the house of marheyo, and kory-kory had
frequent occasion to show his skill in their use.

but the great staple articles of food into which the bread-fruit is
converted by these natives are known respectively by the names of amar
and poee-poee.

at a certain season of the year, when the fruit of the hundred groves
of the valley has reached its maturity, and hangs in golden spheres from
every branch, the islanders assemble in harvest groups, and garner in
the abundance which surrounds them.

power i felt myself to be entirely placed, especially when it was
combined with the knowledge that these very men, kind and respectful
as they were to me, were, after all, nothing better than a set of
cannibals.

but my chief source of anxiety, and that which poisoned every temporary
enjoyment, was the mysterious disease in my leg, which still remained
unabated. all the herbal applications of tinor, united with the severer
discipline of the old leech, and the affectionate nursing of kory-kory,
had failed to relieve me. i was almost a cripple, and the pain i endured
at intervals was agonizing. the unaccountable malady showed no signs
of amendment: on the contrary, its violence increased day by day, and
threatened the most fatal results, unless some powerful means were
employed to counteract it. it seemed as if i were destined to sink
under this grievous affliction, or at least that it would hinder me from
availing myself of any opportunity of escaping from the valley.

some reason or other, would interpose every possible obstacle to my
leaving them.

one morning there was no little excitement evinced by the people near
my abode, and which i soon discovered proceeded from a vague report
that boats, had been seen at a great distance approaching the bay.
immediately all was bustle and animation. it so happened that day that
the pain i suffered having somewhat abated, and feeling in much better
spirits than usual, i had complied with kory-kory’s invitation to visit
the chief mehevi at the place called the ‘ti’, which i have before
described as being situated within the precincts of the taboo groves.
these sacred recesses were at no great distance from marheyo’s
habitation, and lay between it and the sea; the path that conducted to
the beach passing directly in front of the ti, and thence skirting along
the border of the groves.

i was reposing upon the mats, within the sacred building, in company
with mehevi and several other

the ti, he laid his hand upon my shoulder, and said gravely, ‘abo, abo’
(wait, wait). solely intent upon the one thought that occupied my mind,
and heedless of his request, i was brushing past him, when suddenly he
assumed a tone of authority, and told me to ‘moee’ (sit down). though
struck by the alteration in his demeanour, the excitement under which i
laboured was too strong to permit me to obey the unexpected command,
and i was still limping towards the edge of the pi-pi with kory-kory
clinging to one arm in his efforts to restrain me, when the natives
around started to their feet, ranged themselves along the open front of
the building, while mehevi looked at me scowlingly, and reiterated his
commands still more sternly.

it was at this moment, when fifty savage countenances were glaring upon
me, that i first truly experienced i was indeed a captive in the
valley. the conviction rushed upon me with staggering force, and i was
overwhelmed by this confirmation of my worst fears

ceived the natives one after the other hurrying past the ti and
pursuing the route that conducted to the sea. these savages, thought
i, will soon be holding communication with some of my own countrymen
perhaps, who with ease could restore me to liberty did they know of the
situation i was in. no language can describe the wretchedness which i
felt; and in the bitterness of my soul i imprecated a thousand curses on
the perfidious toby, who had thus abandoned me to destruction. it was in
vain that kory-kory tempted me with food, or lighted my pipe, or sought
to attract my attention by performing the uncouth antics that
had sometimes diverted me. i was fairly knocked down by this last
misfortune, which, much as i had feared it, i had never before had the
courage calmly to contemplate.

regardless of everything but my own sorrow, i remained in the ti for
several hours, until shouts proceeding at intervals from the groves
beyond the house proclaimed the return of the natives from the beach.

nted me.

as soon as i was enabled to ramble about the valley in company with the
natives, troops of whom followed me whenever i sallied out of the house,
i began to experience an elasticity of mind which placed me beyond the
reach of those dismal forebodings to which i had so lately been a prey.
received wherever i went with the most deferential kindness; regaled
perpetually with the most delightful fruits; ministered to by dark-eyed
nymphs, and enjoying besides all the services of the devoted kory-kory,
i thought that, for a sojourn among cannibals, no man could have well
made a more agreeable one.

to be sure there were limits set to my wanderings. toward the sea my
progress was barred by an express prohibition of the savages; and after
having made two or three ineffectual attempts to reach it, as much to
gratify my curiosity as anything else, i gave up the idea. it was in
vain to think of reaching it by stealth, since the natives escorted me
in numbers wherever i went, and not for one singl

 i began to think the contending armies
had agreed upon a suspension of hostilities; when pop went a third gun,
followed as before with a yell. after this, for nearly two hours
nothing occurred worthy of comment, save some straggling shouts from the
hillside, sounding like the halloos of a parcel of truant boys who had
lost themselves in the woods.

during this interval i had remained standing on the piazza of the ‘ti,’
which directly fronted the happar mountain, and with no one near me
but kory-kory and the old superannuated savages i have described. these
latter never stirred from their mats, and seemed altogether unconscious
that anything unusual was going on.

as for kory-kory, he appeared to think that we were in the midst of
great events, and sought most zealously to impress me with a due sense
of their importance. every sound that reached us conveyed some momentous
item of intelligence to him. at such times, as if he were gifted with
second sight, he would go through a variety of pan

taking an hour or two to load and train. at last, no sound whatever
proceeding from the mountains, i concluded that the contest had been
determined one way or the other. such appeared, indeed, to be the case,
for in a little while a courier arrived at the ‘ti’, almost breathless
with his exertions, and communicated the news of a great victory having
been achieved by his countrymen: ‘happar poo arva!--happar poo arva!’
(the cowards had fled). kory-kory was in ecstasies, and commenced a
vehement harangue, which, so far as i understood it, implied that the
result exactly agreed with his expectations, and which, moreover,
was intended to convince me that it would be a perfectly useless
undertaking, even for an army of fire-eaters, to offer battle to the
irresistible heroes of our valley. in all this i of course acquiesced,
and looked forward with no little interest to the return of the
conquerors, whose victory i feared might not have been purch

i was in the land of the spirits. i stood indeed as little chance among
them as a cumbrous whale attacked on all sides by a legion of swordfish.
when at length they relinquished their hold of me, they swam away in
every direction, laughing at my clumsy endeavours to reach them.

there was no boat on the lake; but at my solicitation and for my special
use, some of the young men attached to marheyo’s household, under
the direction of the indefatigable kory-kory, brought up a light and
tastefully carved canoe from the sea. it was launched upon the sheet
of water, and floated there as gracefully as a swan. but, melancholy to
relate, it produced an effect i had not anticipated. the sweet nymphs,
who had sported with me before on the lake, now all fled its vicinity.
the prohibited craft, guarded by the edicts of the ‘taboo,’ extended the
prohibition to the waters in which it lay.

for a few days, kory-kory, with one or two other youths, accompanied

nymphs. the honest fellow looked at me bewildered for a moment, and
then shook his head solemnly, and murmured ‘taboo! taboo!’ giving me to
understand that unless the canoe was removed i could not expect to have
the young ladies back again. but to this procedure i was averse; i not
only wanted the canoe to stay where it was, but i wanted the beauteous
fayaway to get into it, and paddle with me about the lake. this latter
proposition completely horrified kory-kory’s notions of propriety. he
inveighed against it, as something too monstrous to be thought of. it
not only shocked their established notions of propriety, but was at
variance with all their religious ordinances.

however, although the ‘taboo’ was a ticklish thing to meddle with, i
determined to test its capabilities of resisting an attack. i consulted
the chief mehevi, who endeavoured to dissuade me from my object; but
i was not to be repulsed; and accordingly increased the warmth of my

the islanders should be taught a little gallantry, and i trust that the
example i set them may produce beneficial effects. ridiculous, indeed,
that the lovely creatures should be obliged to paddle about in the
water, like so many ducks, while a parcel of great strapping fellows
skimmed over its surface in their canoes.

the first day after fayaway’s emancipation, i had a delightful little
party on the lake--the damsels’ kory-kory, and myself. my zealous
body-servant brought from the house a calabash of poee-poee, half a
dozen young cocoanuts--stripped of their husks--three pipes, as many
yams, and me on his back a part of the way. something of a load; but
kory-kory was a very strong man for his size, and by no means brittle in
the spine. we had a very pleasant day; my trusty valet plied the paddle
and swept us gently along the margin of the water, beneath the shades
of the overhanging thickets. fayaway and i reclined in

reed of her pipe, with its quaintly carved bowl, and every few moments
languishingly giving forth light wreaths of vapour from her mouth and

we floated about thus for several hours, when i looked up to the warm,
glowing, tropical sky, and then down into the transparent depths below;
and when my eye, wandering from the bewitching scenery around, fell upon
the grotesquely-tattooed form of kory-kory, and finally, encountered the
pensive gaze of fayaway, i thought i had been transported to some fairy
region, so unreal did everything appear.

this lovely piece of water was the coolest spot in all the valley, and i
now made it a place of continual resort during the hottest period of
the day. one side of it lay near the termination of a long gradually
expanding gorge, which mounted to the heights that environed the vale.

 eddied about their summits, and was sometimes driven down the
steep ravine and swept across the valley, ruffling in its passage the
otherwise tranquil surface of the lake.

one day, after we had been paddling about for some time, i disembarked
kory-kory, and paddled the canoe to the windward side of the lake. as
i turned the canoe, fayaway, who was with me, seemed all at once to be
struck with some happy idea. with a wild exclamation of delight, she
disengaged from her person the ample robe of tappa which was knotted
over her shoulder (for the purpose of shielding her from the sun), and
spreading it out like a sail, stood erect with upraised arms in the head
of the canoe. we american sailors pride ourselves upon our straight,
clean spars, but

a prettier little mast than fayaway made was never
shipped aboard of any craft.

in a moment the tappa was distended by the breeze--the long brown
tresses of fayaway streamed in the air--and the canoe glided rapidly
through the water, and shot towards the shore. seated in the stern, i
directed its course with my paddle until it dashed up the soft sloping
bank, and fayaway, with a light spring alighted on the ground; whilst
kory-kory, who had watched our manoeuvres with admiration, now
clapped his hands in transport, and shouted like a madman. many a time
afterwards was this feat repeated.

if the reader has not observed ere this that i was the declared admirer
of miss fayaway, all i can say is that he is little conversant with
affairs of the heart, and i certainly shall not trouble myself to
enlighten him any farther. out of the calico i had brought from the ship
i made a dress for this lovely girl. in it she looked, i mus

how strongly rooted, then, must be the determination of the typees
with regard to me, and how suddenly could they display the strangest
passions! the mere suggestion of my departure had estranged from me,
for the time at least, mehevi, who was the most influential of all
the chiefs, and who had previously exhibited so many instances of his
friendly sentiments. the rest of the natives had likewise evinced their
strong repugnance to my wishes, and even kory-kory himself seemed to
share in the general disapprobation bestowed upon me.

in vain i racked my invention to find out some motive for them, but i
could discover none.

but however this might be, the scene which had just occurred admonished
me of the danger of trifling with the wayward and passionate spirits
against whom it was vain to struggle, and might even be fatal to do go.
my only hope was to induce the natives to believe that i was reconciled
to my detention in the valley, and by assuming a

untouched, where i had first happened to throw them. i remembered,
however, that after awhile i had missed them from their accustomed
place; but the matter gave me no concern, supposing that tinor--like any
other tidy housewife, having come across them in some of her domestic
occupations--had pitched the useless things out of the house. but i was
soon undeceived.

one day i observed old marheyo bustling about me with unusual activity,
and to such a degree as almost to supersede kory-kory in the functions
of his office. one moment he volunteered to trot off with me on his back
to the stream; and when i refused, noways daunted by the repulse, he
continued to frisk about me like a superannuated house-dog. i could not
for the life of me conjecture what possessed the old gentleman, until
all at once, availing himself of the temporary absence of the household,
he went through a variety of of uncouth gestures, pointing eagerly down
to my feet, then up to a little bundle, which swung f

succession; and with these unsophisicated savages the history of a
day is the history of a life. i will, therefore, as briefly as i can,
describe one of our days in the valley.

to begin with the morning. we were not very early risers--the sun would
be shooting his golden spikes above the happar mountain, ere i threw
aside my tappa robe, and girding my long tunic about my waist, sallied
out with fayaway and kory-kory, and the rest of the household, and bent
my steps towards the stream. here we found congregated all those who
dwelt in our section of the valley; and here we bathed with them. the
fresh morning air and the cool flowing waters put both soul and body in
a glow, and after a half-hour employed in this recreation, we sauntered
back to the house--tinor and marheyo gathering dry sticks by the way
for fire-wood; some of the young men laying the cocoanut trees under
contribution as they passed beneath t

hem; while kory-kory played his
outlandish pranks for my particular diversion, and fayaway and i, not
arm in arm to be sure, but sometimes hand in hand, strolled along, with
feelings of perfect charity for all the world, and especial good-will
towards each other.

our morning meal was soon prepared. the islanders are somewhat
abstemious at this repast; reserving the more powerful efforts of
their appetite to a later period of the day. for my own part, with the
assistance of my valet, who, as i have before stated, a

by friction with a smooth stone in the water. in truth these innocent
people seemed to be at no loss for something to occupy their time; and
it would be no light task to enumerate all their employments, or rather
pleasures.

my own mornings i spent in a variety of ways. sometimes i rambled about
from house to house, sure of receiving a cordial welcome wherever i
went; or from grove to grove, and from one shady place to another, in
company with kory-kory and fayaway, and a rabble rout of merry young
idlers. sometimes i was too indolent for exercise, and accepting one of
the many invitations i was continually receiving, stretched myself out
on the mats of some hospitable dwelling, and occupied myself pleasantly
either in watching the proceedings of those around me or taking part
in them myself. whenever i chose to do the latter, the delight of the
islanders was boundless; and there was always a throng of competitors

g the greater part of them, and climbing from one to another,
is a wilderness of vines, in whose sinewy embrace many of the stones
lie half-hidden, while in some places a thick growth of bushes entirely
covers them. there is a wild pathway which obliquely crosses two of
these terraces; and so profound is the shade, so dense the vegetation,
that a stranger to the place might pass along it without being aware of
their existence.

these structures bear every indication of a very high antiquity and
kory-kory, who was my authority in all matters of scientific research,
gave me to understand that they were coeval with the creation of the
world; that the great gods themselves were the builders; and that they
would endure until time shall be no more.

kory-kory’s prompt explanation and his attributing the work to a
divine origin, at once convinced me that neither he nor the rest of his
country-men knew anything about them.

their rude implements have chiselled and hammered them into shape?

all of these larger pi-pis--like that of the hoolah hoolah ground in the
typee valley--bore incontestible marks of great age; and i am disposed
to believe that their erection may be ascribed to the same race of men
who were the builders of the still more ancient remains i have just
described.

according to kory-kory’s account, the pi-pi upon which stands the hoolah
hoolah ground was built a great many moons ago, under the direction of
monoo, a great chief and warrior, and, as it would appear, master-mason
among the typees. it was erected for the express purpose to which it is
at present devoted, in the incredibly short period of one sun; and was
dedicated to the immortal wooden idols by a grand festival, which lasted
ten days and nights.

preparations for a grand festival in the valley--strange doings in
the taboo groves--monument of calabashes--gala costume of the typee
damsels--departure for the festival

from the time that my lameness had decreased i had made a daily practice
of visiting mehevi at the ti, who invariably gave me a most cordial
reception. i was always accompanied in these excursions by fayaway
and the ever-present kory-kory. the former, as soon as we reached the
vicinity of the ti--which was rigorously tabooed to the whole female
sex--withdrew to a neighbouring hut, as if her feminine delicacy
‘restricted’ her from approaching a habitation which might be regarded
as a sort of bachelor’s hall.

and in good truth it might well have been so considered. although it
was the permanent residence of several distinguished chiefs, and of
the noble mehevi in particular, it was still at certain seasons the
favourite hau

f spirits and gave me to understand that
on the morrow there would be grand doings in the groves generally, and
at the ti in particular; and urged me by no means to absent myself. in
commemoration of what event, however, or in honour of what
distinguished personage, the feast was to be given, altogether passed my
comprehension. mehevi sought to enlighten my ignorance, but he failed as
signally as when he had endeavoured to initiate me into the perplexing
arcana of the taboo.

on leaving the ti, kory-kory, who had as a matter of course accompanied
me, observing that my curiosity remained unabated, resolved to make
everything plain and satisfactory. with this intent, he escorted
me through the taboo groves, pointing out to my notice a variety of
objects, and endeavoured to explain them in such an indescribable jargon
of words, that it almost put me in bodily pain to listen to him. in
particular, he led me to a remarkable pyramidical structure some three
yards square at the base, and perhaps ten f

unk into utter insignificance beside the
exquisite simplicity of attire adopted by the nymphs of the vale on this
festive occasion. i should like to have seen a gallery of coronation
beauties, at westminster abbey, confronted for a moment by this band of
island girls; their stiffness, formality, and affectation, contrasted
with the artless vivacity and unconcealed natural graces of these savage
maidens. it would be the venus de’ medici placed beside a milliner’s
doll. it was not long before kory-kory and myself were left alone in the
house, the rest of its inmates having departed for the taboo groves.
my valet was all impatience to follow them; and was as fidgety about my
dilatory movements as a diner out waiting hat in hand at the bottom
of the stairs for some lagging companion. at last, yielding to his
importunities, i set out for the ti. as we passed the houses peeping out
from the groves through which our route lay, i noticed that they were
entirely deserted by their inhabitants.

when 
 
 ___________________________
 
we reached the rock that abruptly terminated the path, and
concealed from us the festive scene, wild shouts and a confused blending
of voices assured me that the occasion, whatever it might be, had
drawn together a great multitude. kory-kory, previous to mounting the
elevation, paused for a moment, like a dandy at a ball-room door, to put
a hasty finish to his toilet. during this short interval, the thought
struck me that i ought myself perhaps to be taking some little pains
with my appearance.

but as i had no holiday raiment, i was not a little puzzled to devise
some means of decorating myself. however, as i felt desirous to create a
sensation, i determined to do all that lay in my power; and knowing that
i could not delight the

the tobacco used among the typees was of a very mild and pleasing
flavour, and as i always saw it in leaves, and the natives appeared
pretty well supplied with it, i was led to believe that it must have
been the growth of the valley. indeed kory-kory gave me to understand
that this was the case; but i never saw a single plant growing on the
island. at nukuheva, and, i believe, in all the other valleys, the weed
is very scarce, being only obtained in small quantities from foreigners,
and smoking is consequently with the inhabitants of these places a very
great luxury. how it was that the typees were so well furnished with
it i cannot divine. i should think them too indolent to devote any
attention to its culture; and, indeed, as far as my ob

mehevi, who was greatly delighted with the change in my costume, gave
me a cordial welcome. he had reserved for me a most delectable mess
of ‘cokoo’, well knowing my partiality for that dish; and had likewise
selected three or four young cocoanuts, several roasted bread-fruit,
and a magnificent bunch of bananas, for my especial comfort and
gratification. these various matters were at once placed before me; but
kory-kory deemed the banquet entirely insufficient for my wants until
he had supplied me with one of the leafy packages of pork, which,
notwithstanding the somewhat hasty manner in which it had been prepared,
possessed a most excellent flavour, and was surprisingly sweet and
tender.

pork is not a staple article of food among the people of the marquesas;
consequently they pay little attention to the breeding of the swine. the
hogs are permitted to roam at large on the groves, where they obtain
no small p

 like so many sticks bobbing to the surface, after being pressed

countenance, and continued their extraordinary movements without
a single moment’s cessation. they did not appear to attract the
observation of the crowd around them, but i must candidly confess that
for my own part, i stared at them most pertinaciously.

desirous of being enlightened in regard to the meaning of this peculiar
diversion, i turned, inquiringly to kory-kory; that learned typee
immediately proceeded to explain the whole matter thoroughly. but all
that i could comprehend from what he said was, that the leaping figures
before me were bereaved widows, whose partners had been slain in battle
many moons previously; and who, at every festival, gave public evidence
in this manner of their calamities. it was evident that kory-kory
considered this an all-sufficient reason for so indecorous a custom; but
i must say that it did not satisfy me as to its propri

ontinual motion.

but no attention whatever seemed to be paid to the drummers or to the
old priests; the individuals who composed the vast crowd present being
entirely taken up in chanting and laughing with one another, smoking,
drinking ‘arva’, and eating. for all the observation it attracted,
or the good it achieved, the whole savage orchestra might with great
advantage to its own members and the company in general, have ceased the
prodigious uproar they were making.

in vain i questioned kory-kory and others of the natives, as to the
meaning of the strange things that were going on; all their explanations
were conveyed in such a mass of outlandish gibberish and gesticulation
that i gave up the attempt in despair. all that day the drums resounded,
the priests chanted, and the multitude feasted and roared till sunset,
when the throng dispersed, and the taboo groves were again abandoned to
quiet and repose. the next day the same scene was repeated until night,

ideas suggested by the feast of calabashes--inaccuracy of certain
published accounts of the islands--a reason--neglected state of
heathenism in the valley--effigy of a dead warrior--a singular
superstition--the priest kolory and the god moa artua--amazing religious
observance--a dilapidated shrine--kory-kory and the idol--an inference

although i had been baffled in my attempts to learn the origin of
the feast of calabashes, yet it seemed very plain to me that it was
principally, if not wholly, of a religious character. as a religious
solemnity, however, it had not at all corresponded with the horrible
descriptions of polynesian worship which we have received in some
published narratives, and especially in those accounts of the
evangelized islands with which the missionaries have favoured us. did

ong leaves of the palmetto drooped over the eaves, and through them you
saw the warrior holding his paddle with both hands in the act of rowing,
leaning forward and inclining his head, as if eager to hurry on his
voyage. glaring at him forever, and face to face, was a polished human
skull, which crowned the prow of the canoe. the spectral figurehead,
reversed in its position, glancing backwards, seemed to mock the
impatient attitude of the warrior.

when i first visited this singular place with kory-kory, he told me--or
at least i so understood him--that the chief was paddling his way to
the realms of bliss, and bread-fruit--the polynesian heaven--where
every moment the bread-fruit trees dropped their ripened spheres to the
ground, and where there was no end to the cocoanuts and bananas: there
they reposed through the livelong eternity upon mats much finer than
those of typee; and every day bathed their glowing limbs in rivers
of cocoanut oil. in that happy land there were plenty of plumes and

feathers, and boars’-tusks and sperm-whale teeth, far preferable to all
the shining trinkets and gay tappa of the white men; and, best of all,
women far lovelier than the daughters of earth were there in abundance.
‘a very pleasant place,’ kory-kory said it was; ‘but after all, not much
pleasanter, he thought, than typee.’ ‘did he not then,’ i asked him,
‘wish to accompany the warrior?’ ‘oh no: he was very happy where he was;
but supposed that some time or other he would go in his own canoe.’

thus far, i think, i clearly comprehended kory-kory. but there was a
singular expression he made use of at the time, enforced by as singular
a gesture, the meaning of which i would have given much to penetrate.
i am inclined to believ

e it must have been a proverb he uttered; for i
afterwards heard him repeat the same words several times, and in what
appeared to me to be a somewhat: similar sense. indeed, kory-kory had
a great variety of short, smart-sounding sentences, with which he
frequently enlivened his discourse; and he introduced them with an air
which plainly intimated, that in his opinion, they settled the matter in
question, whatever it might be.

could it have been then, that when i asked him whether he desired to go
to this heaven of bread-fruit, cocoanuts, and young ladies, which he had
been describing, he answered by saying something equivalent to our
old adage--‘a bird in the hand is wort

kory-kory was a discreet and sensible fellow, and i cannot sufficiently
admire his shrewdness.

whenever, in the course of my rambles through the valley i happened to
be near the chief’s mausoleum, i always turned aside to visit it. the
place had a peculiar charm for me; i hardly know why, but so it was. as
i leaned over the railing and gazed upon the strange effigy and watched
the play of the feathery head-dress, stirred by the same breeze which in
low tones breathed amidst the lofty palm-trees, i lov

and dignified personages of the taboo groves, i cannot divine. and yet
mehevi, and other chiefs of unquestionable veracity--to say nothing of
the primate himself--assured me over and over again that moa artua was
the tutelary deity of typee, and was more to be held in honour than a
whole battalion of the clumsy idols in the hoolah hoolah grounds.

kory-kory--who seemed to have devoted considerable attention to the
study of theology, as he knew the names of all the graven images in the
valley, and often repeated them over to me--likewise entertained some
rather enlarged ideas with regard to the character and pretensions of
moa artua. he once gave me to understand, with a gesture there was no
misconceiving, that if he (moa artua) were so minded he could cause a
cocoanut tree to sprout out of his (kory-kory’s) head; and that it
would be the easiest

worshippers were such a precious set of fickle-minded and irreverent
heathens, that there was no telling when they might topple one of them
over, break it to pieces, and making a fire with it on the very altar
itself, fall to roasting the offerings of bread-fruit, and at them in
spite of its teeth.

in how little reverence these unfortunate deities were held by the
natives was on one occasion most convincingly proved to me.--walking
with kory-kory through the deepest recesses of the groves, i perceived
a curious looking image, about six feet in height which originally had
been placed upright against a low pi-pi, surmounted by a ruinous bamboo
temple, but having become fatigued and weak in the knees, was now
carelessly leaning against it. the idol was partly concealed by the
foliage of a tree which stood near, and whose leafy boughs drooped over
the pile of stones, as if to protect the rude fane from the decay to

the nose had taken its departure, and from the general appearance of the
head it might have, been supposed that the wooden divinity, in despair
at the neglect of its worshippers, had been trying to beat its own
brains out against the surrounding trees.

i drew near to inspect more closely this strange object of idolatry, but
halted reverently at the distance of two or three paces, out of regard
to the religious prejudices of my valet. as soon, however, as kory-kory
perceived that i was in one of my inquiring, scientific moods, to my
astonishment, he sprang to the side of the idol, and pushing it away
from the stones against which it rested, endeavoured to make it stand
upon its legs. but the divinity had lost the use of them altogether; and
while kory-kory was trying to prop it up, placing a stick between it
and the pi-pi, the monster fell clumsily to the ground, and would have

w in such a rage before. he leaped furiously
to his feet, and seizing the stick, began beating the poor image: every
moment, or two pausing and talking to it in the most violent manner, as
if upbraiding it for the accident. when his indignation had subsided
a little he whirled the idol about most profanely, so as to give me an
opportunity of examining it on all sides. i am quite sure i never should
have presumed to have taken such liberties with the god myself, and i
was not a little shocked at kory-kory’s impiety.

this anecdote speaks for itself. when one of the inferior order of
natives could show such contempt for a venerable and decrepit god of the
groves, what the state of religion must be among the people in general
is easy to be imagined. in truth, i regard the typees as a back-slidden
generation. they are sunk in religious sloth, and require a spiritual
revival. a long prosperity of bread-fruit and cocoanuts has rendered
them remiss in the performance of their higher obligations. the

s not the only person upon whom the
damsel moonoony smiled--the young fellow of fifteen, who permanently
resided in the home with her, was decidedly in her good graces. i
sometimes beheld both him and the chief making love at the same time. is
it possible, thought i, that the valiant warrior can consent to give
up a corner in the thing he loves? this too was a mystery which, with
others of the same kind, was afterwards satisfactorily explained.

during the second day of the feast of calabashes, kory-kory--being
determined that i should have some understanding on these matters--had,
in the course of his explanations, directed my attention to
a peculiarity i had frequently remarked among many of the
females;--principally those of a mature age and rather matronly
appearance. this consisted in having the right hand and the left foot
most elaborately tattooed; whilst the rest of the body was wholly free
from the operation of the art, with the exception of the minutely dotted
lips and slight marks on

 the shoulders, to which i have previously
referred as comprising the sole tattooing exhibited by fayaway, in
common with other young girls of her age. the hand and foot thus
embellished were, according to kory-kory, the distinguishing badge of
wedlock, so far as that social and highly commendable institution is
known among those people. it answers, indeed, the same purpose as the
plain gold ring worn by our fairer spouses.

after kory-kory’s explanation of the subject, i was for some time
studiously respectful in the presence of all females thus distinguished,
and never ventured to indulge in the slightest approach to flirtation
with any of their number. married women, to be sure!--i knew better than
to offend them.

a further insight, however, into the peculiar domestic customs of the
inmates of the valley did away in a measure with the severity of my
scruples, and convinced me that i was deceived in some at least of my

parchments and title-deeds there were none on the island; and i am half
inclined to believe that its inhabitants hold their broad valleys in fee

and water runs; or until their french visitors, by a summary mode of
conveyancing, shall appropriate them to their own benefit and behoof.

yesterday i saw kory-kory hie him away, armed with a long pole, with
which, standing on the ground, he knocked down the fruit from the
topmost boughs of the trees, and brought them home in his basket of
cocoanut leaves. today i see an islander, whom i know to reside in a
distant part of the valley, doing the self-same thing. on the sloping
bank of the stream are a number of banana-trees i have often seen a

whatever. they all thought and acted alike. i do not conceive that they
could support a debating society for a single night: there would be
nothing to dispute about; and were they to call a convention to take
into consideration the state of the tribe, its session would be a
remarkably short one. they showed this spirit of unanimity in every
action of life; everything was done in concert and good fellowship. i
will give an instance of this fraternal feeling.

one day, in returning with kory-kory from my accustomed visit to the
ti, we passed by a little opening in the grove; on one side of which,
my attendant informed me, was that afternoon to be built a dwelling of
bamboo. at least a hundred of the natives were bringing materials to the
ground, some carrying in their hands one or two of the canes which were
to form the sides, others slender rods of the habiscus, strung with
palmetto leaves, for the roof. every one contributed something to the
work; and by the united, but easy, and even

wild glare of these enormous flambeaux, lighting up with a startling
brilliancy the innermost recesses of the vale, and seen moving rapidly
along beneath the canopy of leaves, the savage shout of the excited
messengers sounding the news of their approach, which was answered
on all sides, and the strange appearance of their naked bodies, seen
against the gloomy background, produced altogether an effect upon my
mind that i shall long remember.

it was on this same occasion that kory-kory awakened me at the dead
hour of night, and in a sort of transport communicated the intelligence
contained in the words ‘pehee perni’ (fish come). as i happened to have
been in a remarkably sound and refreshing slumber, i could not imagine
why the information had not been deferred until morning, indeed, i felt
very much inclined to fly into a passion and box my valet’s ears; but on
second thoughts i got quietly up, and on going outside the house was not

dumb beauty they hovered by me whilst i was walking, or looked down upon
me with steady curious eyes from out the foliage, i was almost inclined
to fancy that they knew they were gazing upon a stranger, and that they
commiserated his fate.



chapter thirty

a professor of the fine arts--his persecutions--something about
tattooing and tabooing--two anecdotes in illustration of the latter--a
few thoughts on the typee dialect

in one of my strolls with kory-kory, in passing along the border of a
thick growth of bushes, my attention was arrested by a singular noise.
on entering the thicket i witnessed for the first time the operation of
tattooing as performed by these islanders.

i beheld a man extended flat upon his back on the ground, and, despite
the forced composure of his countenance, it was evident that he was
suffering agony. his tormentor bent over him, working away for all the
world like a stone-cutter with mallet and chisel. in one hand he hel

the artist was not at this time engaged on an original sketch, his
subject being a venerable savage, whose tattooing had become somewhat
faded with age and needed a few repairs, and accordingly he was merely
employed in touching up the works of some of the old masters of the
typee school, as delineated upon the human canvas before him. the parts
operated upon were the eyelids, where a longitudinal streak, like the
one which adorned kory-kory, crossed the countenance of the victim.

in spite of all the efforts of the poor old man, sundry twitchings and
screwings of the muscles of the face denoted the exquisite sensibility
of these shutters to the windows of his soul, which he was now having
repainted. but the artist, with a heart as callous as that of an army
surgeon, continued his performance, enlivening his labours with a wild
chant, tapping away the while as merrily as a woodpecker.

so deeply engaged was he in his work, that he

 could exceed his grief and disappointment. but
recovering from this, he seemed determined not to credit my assertion,
and grasping his implements, he flourished them about in fearful
vicinity to my face, going through an imaginary performance of his art,
and every moment bursting into some admiring exclamation at the beauty
of his designs.

horrified at the bare thought of being rendered hideous for life if the
wretch were to execute his purpose upon me, i struggled to get away
from him, while kory-kory, turning traitor, stood by, and besought me
to comply with the outrageous request. on my reiterated refusals the
excited artist got half beside himself, and was overwhelmed with sorrow
at losing so noble an opportunity of distinguishing himself in his
profession.

the idea of engrafting his tattooing upon my white skin filled him
with all a painter’s enthusiasm; again and again he gazed into my
countenance, and every fresh glimpse seemed to add to the vehemence
of his ambition. not knowing to

ise indignantly, and still continued his attack on
my face, as though nothing short of that would satisfy him. when his
forefinger swept across my features, in laying out the borders of those
parallel bands which were to encircle my countenance, the flesh fairly
crawled upon my bones. at last, half wild with terror and indignation, i
succeeded in breaking away from the three savages, and fled towards old
marheyo’s house, pursued by the indomitable artist, who ran after me,
implements in hand. kory-kory, however, at last interfered and drew him
off from the chase.

this incident opened my eyes to a new danger; and i now felt convinced
that in some luckless hour i should be disfigured in such a manner as
never more to have the face to return to my countrymen, even should an
opportunity offer.

these apprehensions were greatly increased by the desire which king
mehevi and several of the inferior chiefs now manifested that i should
be tattooed. the pleasure of the king was first signified to me s

blows right and left, they would disperse in all directions much to the
enjoyment of mehevi, the chiefs, and themselves.

the noble art of self-defence appeared to be regarded by them as the
peculiar gift of the white man; and i make little doubt that they
supposed armies of europeans were drawn up provided with nothing else
but bony fists and stout hearts, with which they set to in column, and
pummelled one another at the word of command.

      . . . . .  .  .  .

one day, in company with kory-kory, i had repaired to the stream for the
purpose of bathing, when i observed a woman sitting upon a rock in
the midst of the current, and watching with the liveliest interest the
gambols of something, which at first i took to be an uncommonly large
species of frog that was sporting in the water near her. attracted by
the novelty of the sight, i waded towards the spot where she sat, and
could hardly credit the evidence of my senses when i beheld a little
infant, the period of whose birth could not

 of my casual encounter with karky the artist, my life was
one of absolute wretchedness. not a day passed but i was persecuted by
the solicitations of some of the natives to subject myself to the odious
operation of tattooing. their importunities drove me half wild, for i
felt how easily they might work their will upon me regarding this or
anything else which they took into their heads. still, however, the
behaviour of the islanders towards me was as kind as ever. fayaway was
quite as engaging; kory-kory as devoted; and mehevi the king just as
gracious and condescending as before. but i had now been three months in
their valley, as nearly as i could estimate; i had grown familiar with
the narrow limits to which my wandering had been confined; and i began
bitterly to feel the state of captivity in which i was held. there
was no one with whom i could freely converse; no one to whom i could
communicate my thoughts; no one who could sympathize with my sufferings.
a thousand times i thought how much

sumed me. an occurrence which happened about this
time affected me most powerfully.

i have already mentioned that from the ridge-pole of marheyo’s house
were suspended a number of packages enveloped in tappa. many of these i
had often seen in the hands of the natives, and their contents had been
examined in my presence. but there were three packages hanging
very nearly over the place where i lay, which from their remarkable
appearance had often excited my curiosity. several times i had asked
kory-kory to show me their contents, but my servitor, who, in almost
every other particular had acceded to my wishes, refused to gratify me
in this.

one day, returning unexpectedly from the ‘ti’, my arrival seemed to
throw the inmates of the house into the greatest confusion. they were
seated together on the mats, and by the lines which extended from the
roof to the floor i immediately perceived that the mysterious packages
were for some purpose or another under inspection. the evident alarm

ages betrayed filled me with forebodings of evil, and with an
uncontrollable desire to penetrate the secret so jealously guarded.
despite the efforts of marheyo and kory-kory to restrain me, i forced
my way into the midst of the circle, and just caught a glimpse of three
human heads, which others of the party were hurriedly enveloping in the
coverings from which they had been taken.

one of the three i distinctly saw. it was in a state of perfect
preservation, and from the slight glimpse i had of it, seemed to have
been subjected to some smoking operation which had reduced it to the
dry, hard, and mummy-like appearance it presented. the two long scalp
locks were twi

ontents of the mysterious
packages, i happened to be at the ti, when another war-alarm was
sounded, and the natives rushing to their arms, sallied out to resist
a second incursion of the happar invaders. the same scene was again
repeated, only that on this occasion i heard at least fifteen reports of
muskets from the mountains during the time that the skirmish lasted.
an hour or two after its termination, loud paeans chanted through the
valley announced the approach of the victors. i stood with kory-kory
leaning against the railing of the pi-pi awaiting their advance, when
a tumultuous crowd of islanders emerged with wild clamours from
the neighbouring groves. in the midst of them marched four men, one
preceding the other at regular intervals of eight or ten feet, with
poles of a corresponding length, extending from shoulder to shoulder,
to which were lashed with thongs of bark three long narrow bundles,
carefully wrapped in ample coverings of freshly plucked palm-leaves,
tacked together with s

, he continued to advance, while the throng
around him with wild cheers sought to encourage him. the other three men
were marked about the arms and breasts with several slight wounds, which
they somewhat ostentatiously displayed.

these four individuals, having been the most active in the late
encounter, claimed the honour of bearing the bodies of their slain
enemies to the ti. such was the conclusion i drew from my own
observations, and, as far as i could understand, from the explanation
which kory-kory gave me.

the royal mehevi walked by the side of these heroes. he carried in one
hand a musket, from the barrel of which was suspended a small canvas
pouch of powder, and in the other he grasped a short javelin, which he
held before him and regarded with fierce exultation. this javelin he had
wrested from a celebrated champion of the happars, who had ignominiously
fled, and was pursued by his foes beyond the summit of the mountain.

when within a short distance of the ti, the warrior with the w

rson of the king
and the dead bodies of the enemy, approached the spot where i stood,
brandishing their rude implements of warfare, many of which were bruised
and broken, and uttering continual shouts of triumph. when the crowd
drew up opposite the ti, i set myself to watch their proceedings most
attentively; but scarcely had they halted when my servitor, who had left
my side for an instant, touched my arm and proposed our returning to
marheyo’s house. to this i objected; but, to my surprise, kory-kory
reiterated his request, and with an unusual vehemence of manner. still,
however, i refused to comply, and was retreating before him, as in his
importunity he pressed upon me, when i felt a heavy hand laid upon my
shoulder, and turning round, encountered the bulky form of mow-mow, a
one-eyed chief, who had just detached himself from the crowd below, and
had mounted the rear of the pi-pi upon which we stood. his cheek had
been pierced by the point of a spear, and the wound imparted a still
more f

rightful expression to his hideously tattooed face, already
deformed by the loss of an eye. the warrior, without uttering a
syllable, pointed fiercely in the direction of marheyo’s house, while
kory-kory, at the same time presenting his back, desired me to mount.

i declined this offer, but intimated my willingness to withdraw, and
moved slowly along the piazza, wondering what could be the cause of this
unusual treatment. a few minutes’ consideration convinced me that the
savages were about to celebrate some hideous rite in connection with
their peculiar customs, and at which they were determined i should not
be present. i descended from the pi-pi, and attended by kory-kory, who
on this occas

 sounds
which had awakened me from sleep on the second day of the feast of
calabashes, assured me that the savages were on the eve of celebrating
another, and, as i fully believed, a horrible solemnity.

all the inmates of the house, with the exception of marheyo, his son,
and tinor, after assuming their gala dresses, departed in the direction
of the taboo groves.

although i did not anticipate a compliance with my request, still, with
a view of testing the truth of my suspicions, i proposed to kory-kory
that, according to our usual custom in the morning, we should take a
stroll to the ti: he positively refused; and when i renewed the request,
he evinced his determination to prevent my going there; and, to divert
my mind from the subject, he offered to accompany me to the stream. we
accordingly went, and bathed. on our coming back to the house, i was
surprised to find that all its inmates had returned, and were lounging
upon the mats as usual, although the drums still sounded from the
groves.


 
 ___________________________
 
the rest of the day i spent with kory-kory and fayaway, wandering about
a part of the valley situated in an opposite direction from the ti,
and whenever i so much as looked towards that building, although it was
hidden from view by intervening trees, and at the distance of more than
a mile, my attendant would exclaim, ‘taboo, taboo!’

at the various houses where we stopped, i found many of the inhabitants
reclining at their ease, or pursuing some light occupation, as if
nothing unusual were going forward; but amongst them all i did 
 
 ___________________________
 
iests only; and everything i now observed agreed with
the account.

the sound of the drums continued without intermission the whole day, and
falling continually upon my ear, caused me a sensation of horror which i
am unable to describe. on the following day, hearing none of those
noisy indications of revelry, i concluded that the inhuman feast was
terminated; and feeling a kind of morbid curiosity to discover whether
the ti might furnish any evidence of what had taken place there, i
proposed to kory-kory to walk there. to this proposition he replied
by pointing with his finger to the newly risen sun, and then up to the
zenith, intimating that our visit must be deferred until noon. shortly
after that hour we accordingly proceeded to the taboo groves, and as
soon as we entered their precincts, i looked fearfully round in, quest
of some memorial of the scene which had so lately been acted there; but
everything appeared as usual. on reaching the ti, we found mehevi and a
few chiefs reclining on the
 
 ___________________________
 
present
position since my last visit, i at once concluded that it must have
some connection with the recent festival, and, prompted by a curiosity
i could not repress, in passing it i raised one end of the cover; at the
same moment the chiefs, perceiving my design, loudly ejaculated, ‘taboo!
taboo!’

but the slight glimpse sufficed; my eyes fell upon the disordered
members of a human skeleton, the bones still fresh with moisture, and
with particles of flesh clinging to them here and there!

kory-kory, who had been a little in advance of me, attracted by
the exclamations of the chiefs, turned round in time to witness the
expression of horror on my countenance. he now hurried towards me,
pointing at the same time to the canoe, and exclaiming rapidly,
‘puarkee! puarkee!’ (pig, pig). i pretended to yield to the deception,
and repeated the words after him several times, as though acquiescing
in what he said. the other savages, either deceived by my conduct
or unwilling to manifest their disp

ght rustling--a
dark form was intercepted between me and the doorway--the slide was
drawn across it, and the individual, whoever he was, returned to
his mat. this was a sad blow to me; but as it might have aroused the
suspicions of the islanders to have made another attempt that night, i
was reluctantly obliged to defer it until the next. several times after
i repeated the same manoeuvre, but with as little success as before.
as my pretence for withdrawing from the house was to allay my thirst,
kory-kory either suspecting some design on my part, or else prompted
by a desire to please me, regularly every evening placed a calabash of
water by my side.

even, under these inauspicious circumstances i again and again renewed
the attempt, but when i did so, my valet always rose with me, as if
determined i should not remove myself from his observation. for
the present, therefore, i was obliged to abandon the attempt; but i
endeavoured to console myself with the idea that by this mode i might
yet effec

t my escape.

shortly after marnoo’s visit i was reduced to such a state that it was
with extreme difficulty i could walk, even with the assistance of a
spear, and kory-kory, as formerly, was obliged to carry me daily to the
stream.

for hours and hours during the warmest part of the day i lay upon my
mat, and while those around me were nearly all dozing away in careless
ease, i remained awake, gloomily pondering over the fate which it
appeared now idle for me to resist, when i thought of the loved friends
who were thousands and thousands of miles from the savage island in
which i was held a captive, when i reflected that my dreadful fate would
for ever be conceale

 with hope deferred they might
continue to await my return long after my inanimate form had blended
with the dust of the valley--i could not repress a shudder of anguish.

how vividly is impressed upon my mind every minute feature of the scene
which met my view during those long days of suffering and sorrow. at my
request my mats were always spread directly facing the door, opposite
which, and at a little distance, was the hut of boughs that marheyo was
building.

whenever my gentle fayaway and kory-kory, laying themselves down beside
me, would leave me awhile to uninterrupted repose, i took a strange
interest in the slightest movements of the eccentric old warrior. all
alone during the stillness of the tropical mid-day, he would pursue his
quiet work, sitting in the shade and weaving together the leaflets of
his cocoanut branches, or rolling upon his knee the twisted fibres of
bark to form the cords with which he tied together the thatching of
his tiny house. frequently suspending his employme

ust have been more than four months since i entered the valley, when
one day about noon, and whilst everything was in profound silence,
mow-mow, the one-eyed chief, suddenly appeared at the door, and leaning
towards me as i lay directly facing him, said in a low tone, ‘toby pemi
ena’ (toby has arrived here). gracious heaven! what a tumult of emotions
rushed upon me at this startling intelligence! insensible to the pain
that had before distracted me, i leaped to my feet, and called wildly
to kory-kory who was reposing by my side. the startled islanders sprang
from their mats; the news was quickly communicated to them; and the
next moment i was making my way to the ti on the back of kory-kory; and
surrounded by the excited savages.

all that i could comprehend of the particulars which mow-mow rehearsed
to his audience as we proceeded, was that my long-lost companion had
arrived in a boat which had just entered the bay. these tidings made
me most anxious to be carried at once to the sea, lest 
 
 ___________________________
 
some untoward
circumstance should prevent our meeting; but to this they would not
consent, and continued their course towards the royal abode. as we
approached it, mehevi and several chiefs showed themselves from the
piazza, and called upon us loudly to come to them.

as soon as we had approached, i endeavoured to make them understand that
i was going down to the sea to meet toby. to this the king objected, and
motioned kory-kory to bring me into the house. it was in vain to resist;
and in a few moments i found myself within the ti, surrounded by a noisy
group engaged in discussing the recent intelligence. toby’s name was
frequently repeated, coupled with violent exclamations of astonishment.
it seemed as if they yet remained in doubt with regard to the fact of
his arrival, at at every fresh report that was brought from the shore
they betrayed the liveliest emotions.

almost frenzied at being held in this state of sus

ot, frequently stooping my head to avoid the branches which crossed
the path, and never ceasing to implore those who carried me to
accelerate their already swift pace.

in this manner we had proceeded about four or five miles, when we were
met by a party of some twenty islanders, between whom and those who
accompanied me ensued an animated conference. impatient of the delay
occasioned by this interruption, i was beseeching the man who carried me
to proceed without his loitering companions, when kory-kory, running
to my side, informed me, in three fatal words, that the news had all
proved, false--that toby had not arrived--‘toby owlee pemi’. heaven only
knows how, in the state of mind and body i then was, i ever sustained
the agony which this intelligence caused me; not that the news was
altogether unexpected; but i had trusted that the fact might not have
been made known until we should have arrived upon the beach. as it was,
i at once foresaw the course the savages would pursue. they had o

might give a joyful welcome to
my long-lost comrade; but now that it was known he had not arrived they
would at once oblige me to turn back.

my anticipations were but too correct. in spite of the resistance i
made, they carried me into a house which was near the spot, and left me
upon the mats. shortly afterwards several of those who had accompanied
me from the ti, detaching themselves from the others, proceeded in
the direction of the sea. those who remained--among whom were marheyo,
mow-mow, kory-kory, and tinor--gathered about the dwelling, and appeared
to be awaiting their return.

this convinced me that strangers--perhaps some of my own countrymen--had
for some cause or other entered the bay. distracted at the idea of their
vicinity, and reckless of the pain which i suffered, i heeded not the
assurances of the islanders, that there were no boats at the beach, but
starting to my feet endeavoured to gain the door. instantly the passage
was blocked up by several men, who commanded me to resu

i pretended to turn a deaf ear, while i urged my solicitations with an
eloquence of gesture which the one-eyed chief appeared unable to resist.
he seemed indeed to regard me as a forward child, to whose wishes he had
not the heart to oppose force, and whom he must consequently humour. he
spoke a few words to the natives, who at once retreated from the door,
and i immediately passed out of the house.

here i looked earnestly round for kory-kory; but that hitherto faithful
servitor was nowhere to be seen. unwilling to linger even for a single
instant when every moment might be so important, i motioned to a
muscular fellow near me to take me upon his back; to my surprise he
angrily refused. i turned to another, but with a like result. a third
attempt was as unsuccessful, and i immediately perceived what had
induced mow-mow to grant my request, and why the other natives conducted
themselves in so strange a manner. it was evident that the

yards i was again surrounded by the
savages, who were still in all the heat of argument, and appeared every
moment as if they would come to blows. in the midst of this tumult
old marheyo came to my side, and i shall never forget the benevolent
expression of his countenance. he placed his arm upon my shoulder, and
emphatically pronounced the only two english words i had taught him
‘home’ and ‘mother’. i at once understood what he meant, and eagerly
expressed my thanks to him. fayaway and kory-kory were by his side, both
weeping violently; and it was not until the old man had twice repeated
the command that his son could bring himself to obey him, and take me
again upon his back. the one-eyed chief opposed his doing so, but he was
overruled, and, as it seemed to me, by some of his own party.

first heard the roar of the surf breaking upon the beach. before long
i saw the flashing billows themselves through the openin

, standing nearly to the waist in the surf, endeavoured to pacify
them; but at length fearful that they would do him some fatal violence,
he beckoned to his comrades to pull in at once, and take him into the
boat.

it was at this agonizing moment, when i thought all hope was ended, that
a new contest arose between the two parties who had accompanied me to
the shore; blows were struck, wounds were given, and blood flowed. in

which was equivalent to a ‘deed of gift’; threw the roll of cotton to

and tumbled the powder-bags out to the nearest young ladies, all of whom
were vastly willing to take them. this distribution did not occupy ten
seconds, and before it was over the boat was under full way; the kanaka
all the while exclaiming loudly against wh
