Lady Basildon and Mrs. Marchmont  - 
      Lady Basildon and Mrs. Marchmont are described as "types of exquisite fragility" with an affection of manner of delicate charm, ideal subjects for the French Rococo painter Watteau. Never developed into major characters, these women frivolously banter on a number of topics throughout Act I; notable ones include the dreariness of politics, being serious, education, and so on. Like Watteau's figures, they are perhaps more decorative than anything else, though--as the insightfulness of their conversatio ns suggests--one can never underestimate the decorative on Wilde's stage.
