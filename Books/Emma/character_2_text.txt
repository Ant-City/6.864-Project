chapter i

emma woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.
she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate, indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sisterâ€™s marriage, been mistress of his house from a very early period. her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance

of her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.
sixteen years had miss taylor been in mr. woodhouseâ€™s family, less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of emma. between them it was more the intimacy of sisters. even before miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming miss taylorâ

”it was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them; but emma was aware that great must be the difference between a mrs. weston, only half a mile from them, and a miss taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude. she dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her. he could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.
the evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and mr. woodhouse had not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits; for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.
her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being settled in london, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily reach; and m

any a long october and november evening must be struggled through at hartfield, before christmas brought the next visit from isabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house, and give her pleasant society again.
highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town, to which hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and name, did really belong, afforded her no equals. the woodhouses were first in consequence there. all looked up to them. she had many acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss taylor for even half a day. it was a melancholy change; and emma could not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful. his spirits required support. he was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was used to, and hat

only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly connected with it, as the elder brother of isabellaâ€™s husband. he lived about a mile from highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london. he had returned to a late dinner, after some daysâ€™ absence, and now walked up to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square. it was a happy circumstance, and animated mr. woodhouse for some time. mr. knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did him good; and his many inquiries after â€œpoor isabellaâ€ and her children were answered most satisfactorily. when this was over, mr. woodhouse gratefully observed, â€œit is very kind of you, mr. knightley, to come out at this late hour to call upon us. i am afraid you must have had a shocking walk.â€
â€œnot at all, sir. it is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that i must draw back from your great fire.â€
â€œbut you

 that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain here. it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast. i wanted them to put off the wedding.â€
â€œby the byeâ€”i have not wished you joy. being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, i have been in no hurry with my congratulations; but i hope it all went off tolerably well. how did you all behave? who cried most?â€
â€œah! poor miss taylor! â€˜tis a sad business.â€
â€œpoor mr. and miss woodhouse, if you please; but i cannot possibly say â€˜poor miss taylor.â€™ i have a great regard for you and emma; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!â€”at any rate, it must be better to have only one to please than two.â€
â€œespecially when one of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!â€ said emma playfully. â€œthat is what you have in your head, i knowâ€”and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.â€
â€œi believe it is very true, my dear, inde

â€œmy dearest papa! you do not think i could mean you, or suppose mr. knightley to mean you. what a horrible idea! oh no! i meant only myself. mr. knightley loves to find fault with me, you knowâ€”in a jokeâ€”it is all a joke. we always say what we like to one another.â€
mr. knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults in emma woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself, she knew it would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body.
â€œemma knows i never flatter her,â€ said mr. knightley, â€œbut i meant no reflection on any body. miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please; she will now have but one. the chances are that she must be a gainer.â

â€œa straightforward, open-hearted man like weston, and a rational, unaffected woman like miss taylor, may be safely left to manage their own concerns. you are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than good to them, by interference.â€
â€œemma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,â€ rejoined mr. woodhouse, understanding but in part. â€œbut, my dear, pray do not make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up oneâ€™s family circle grievously.â€
â€œonly one more, papa; only for mr. elton. poor mr. elton! you like mr. elton, papa,â€”i must look about for a wife for him. there is nobody in highbury who deserves himâ€”and he has been here a whole year, and has fitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have him single any longerâ€”and i thought when he was joining the

d miss bates, or when mrs. and miss bates returned the visit. now was the time for mr. frank churchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion. for a few days, every morning visit in highbury included some mention of the handsome letter mrs. weston had received. â€œi suppose you have heard of the handsome letter mr. frank churchill has written to mrs. weston? i understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed. mr. woodhouse told me of it. mr. woodhouse saw the letter, and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life.â€
it was, indeed, a highly prized letter. mrs. weston had, of course, formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured. she felt herself a most fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough

 of hours of gratitude to mrs. weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfactionâ€”her more than satisfactionâ€”her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent, that emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity â€˜poor miss taylor,â€™ when they left her at randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own. but never did she go without mr. woodhouseâ€™s giving a gentle sigh, and saying, â€œah, poor miss taylor! she would be very glad to stay.â€
there was no recovering miss taylorâ€”nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to mr. woodhouse. the compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him, was all eat up. his own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he could never believe

 other people to be different from himself. what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly tried to prevent any bodyâ€™s eating it. he had been at the pains of consulting mr. perry, the apothecary, on the subject. mr. perry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of mr. woodhouseâ€™s life; and upon being applied to, he could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with manyâ€”perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. with such an opinion, in confirmation of his own, mr. woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.

chapter iii

mr. woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. he liked very much to have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from his long residence at hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked. he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him

, he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he preferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make up a card-table for him.
real, long-standing regard brought the westons and mr. knightley; and by mr. elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of mr. woodhouseâ€™s drawing-room, and the smiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.
after these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were mrs. and miss bates, and mrs. goddard, three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield, and who were fetched and carried home so often, that mr. woodhouse thought it no hardship for either james or the horses. had it taken place only once a year, it would have been a grievance.

mrs. goddard was the mistress of a schoolâ€”not of a seminary, or an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality, upon new principles and new systemsâ€”and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanityâ€”but a real, honest, old-fashioned boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at

y was reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands. it was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church. she was a plain, motherly kind of woman, who had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to mr. woodhouseâ€™s kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside.
these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently able to collect; and happy was she, for her fatherâ€™s sake, in the power; though, as far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the absence of mrs. weston. she was delighted to see her father look comfortable, and very much pleased with herself for cont

upon such occasions poor mr. woodhouseâ€™s feelings were in sad warfare. he loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat.
such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might constrain him

emma allowed her father to talkâ€”but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy. the happiness of miss smith was quite equal to her intentions. miss woodhouse was so great a personage in highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse had treated her all the evening, and actually shaken hands with her at last!

â€œonly four-and-twenty. that is too young to settle. his mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry. they seem very comfortable as they are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would probably repent it. six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it might be very desirable.â€
â€œsix years hence! dear miss woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!â€
â€œwell, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are not born to an independence. mr. martin, i imagine, has his fortune entirely to makeâ€”cannot be at all beforehand with the world. whatever money he might come into when his father died, whatever his share of the family property, it is, i dare say, all afloat, all employed in his stock, and so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time, it is next to impossible t

â€œyes, to be sure, i suppose there are. but while i visit at hartfield, and you are so kind to me, miss woodhouse, i am not afraid of what any body can do.â€
â€œyou understand the force of influence pretty well, harriet; but i would have you so firmly established in good society, as to be independent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse. i want to see you permanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, i say that if you should still be in this country when mr. martin marries, i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with th

they remained but a few minutes together, as miss woodhouse must not be kept waiting; and harriet then came running to her with a smiling face, and in a flutter of spirits, which miss woodhouse hoped very soon to compose.
â€œonly think of our happening to meet him!â€”how very odd! it was quite a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by randalls. he did not think we ever walked this road. he thought we walked towards randalls most days. he has not been able to get the romance of the forest yet. he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that h

â€œi should have been sorry, mr. knightley, to be dependent on your recommendation, had i quitted mr. woodhouseâ€™s family and wanted another situation; i do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body. i am sure you always thought me unfit for the office i held.â€
â€œyes,â€ said he, smiling. â€œyou are better placed here; very fit for a wife, but not at all for a governess. but you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield. you might not give emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise; but you were receiving a very go

d thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object. i should like to see emma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good. but there is nobody hereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom from home.â€
â€œthere does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present,â€ said mrs. weston, â€œas can well be; and while she is so happy at hartfield, i cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor mr. woodhouseâ€™s account. i do not recommend matrimony at present to emma, though i mean no slight to the state, i assure you.â€
part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and mr. westonâ€™s on the subject, as much as possible. there were wishes at randalls respecting emmaâ€™s destiny, but it was not desirable to have them suspected; and the quiet transition which mr. knightley soon afterwards made to â€œwhat does weston think of the weather; shall we have rain?â€ convinced her

â€œlet me entreat you,â€ cried mr. elton; â€œit would indeed be a delight! let me entreat you, miss woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend. i know what your drawings are. how could you suppose me ignorant? is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers; and has not mrs. weston some inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room, at randalls?â€

there was merit in every drawingâ€”in the least finished, perhaps the most; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same. they were both in ecstasies. a likeness pleases every body; and miss woodhouseâ€™s performances must be capital.
â€œno great variety of faces for you,â€ said emma. â€œi had only my own family to study from. there is my fatherâ€”another of my fatherâ€”but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that i could only take him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. mrs. weston again, and again, and again, you see. dear mrs. weston! always my kindest friend on every occasion. she would sit whenever i asked her. there is my sister; and really quite her

â€œby all means. we shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party.â€
the same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction, took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the picture, which was rapid and happy. every body who saw it was pleased, but mr. elton was in continual raptures, and defended it through every criticism.
â€œmiss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted,â€â€”observed mrs. weston to himâ€”not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover.â€”â€œthe expression of the eye is most correct, but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. it is the fault of her face that she has them not.â€
â€œdo you think so?â€ replied he. â€œi cannot agree with you. it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature. i never saw such a likeness in my life. we must allow for the effect of sh

emma knew that she had, but would not own it; and mr. elton warmly added,

â€œit is very pretty,â€ said mr. woodhouse. â€œso prettily done! just as your drawings always are, my dear. i do not know any body who draws so well as you do. the only thing i do not thoroughly like is, that she seems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her shouldersâ€”and it makes one think she must catch cold.â€
â€œbut, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer. look at the tree.â€

the next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a few difficulties. it must be done directly; it must be done in london; the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on; and isabella, the usual doer of all commissions, must not be applied to, because it was december, and mr. woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of december. but no sooner was the distress known to mr. elton, than it was removed. his gallantry was always on the alert. â€œmight he be trusted with the commission, what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it! he could ride to london at any time. it was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand.â€

his parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs which she had lent elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this letter was from him, from mr. martin, and contained a direct proposal of marriage. â€œwho could have thought it? she was so surprized she did not know what to do. yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good letter, at least she thought so. and he wrote as if he really loved her very muchâ€”but she did not knowâ€”and so, she was come as fast as she could to ask miss woodhouse what she should do.â€”â€ emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.

harriet was silent. with a little reserve of manner, emma continued:
â€œyou mean to return a favourable answer, i collect.â€
â€œno, i do not; that is, i do not meanâ€”what shall i do? what would you advise me to do? pray, dear miss woodhouse, tell me what i ought to do.â€
â€œi shall not give you any advice, harriet. i will have nothing to do with it. this is a point which you must settle with your feelings.â€
â€œi had no notion that he liked me so very much,â€ said harriet, contemplating the letter. for a little while emma persevered in her silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,
â€œi lay it down as a general rule, harriet, that if a woman doub

â€œmiss woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, i must do as well as i can by myself; and i have now quite determined, and really almost made up my mindâ€”to refuse mr. martin. do you think i am right?â€
â€œperfectly, perfectly right, my dearest harriet; you are doing just what you ought. while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings to myself, but now that you are so completely decided i have no hesitation in approving. dear harriet, i give myself joy of this. it would have grieved me to lose y

harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her forcibly.
â€œyou could not have visited me!â€ she cried, looking aghast. â€œno, to be sure you could not; but i never thought of that before. that would have been too dreadful!â€”what an escape!â€”dear miss woodhouse, i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world.â€
â€œindeed, harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it must have been. you would have thrown yourself out of all good society. i must have given you up.â€

ks past she had been spending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself; and emma judged it best in every respect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possible just at present. she was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to mrs. goddardâ€™s, but it was then to be settled that she should return to hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.
while she was gone, mr. knightley called, and sat some time with mr. woodhouse and emma, till mr. woodhouse, who had previously made up his mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, and was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of his own civility, to leave mr. knightley for that purpose. mr. knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering by his short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other.
â€œwell, i believe, if you will excuse me, mr. knightley,

. and therefore i think i will beg your excuse and take my three turnsâ€”my winter walk.â€
â€œyou cannot do better, sir.â€
â€œi would ask for the pleasure of your company, mr. knightley, but i am a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and, besides, you have another long walk before you, to donwell abbey.â€
â€œthank you, sir, thank you; i am going this moment myself; and i think the sooner you go the better. i will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you.â€
mr. woodhouse at last was off; but mr. knightley, instead of being immediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for more chat. he began speaking of harriet, and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than emma had ever heard before.
â€œi cannot rate her beauty as you do,â€ said he; â€œbut she is a pretty little creature, and i am inclined to think very well of her disposition. her character depends upon those she is with; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman.â€

y mental provision she was making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with, into a thin quarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by her friend, and ornamented with ciphers and trophies.
in this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon. miss nash, head-teacher at mrs. goddardâ€™s, had written out at least three hundred; and harriet, who had taken the first hint of it from her, hoped, with miss woodhouseâ€™s help, to get a great many more. emma assisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as harriet wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in form as well as quantity.
mr. woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in. â€œso many clever riddles as there used to be when he was youngâ€”he wondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time.â€ and

made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already.
â€œwhy will not you write one yourself for us, mr. elton?â€ said she; â€œthat is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be easier to you.â€
â€œoh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in his life. the stupidest fellow! he was afraid not even miss woodhouseâ€â€”he stopt a momentâ€”â€œor miss smith could inspire him.â€
the very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. he called for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which, from his manner, emma was immediately convinced must be his own.
â€œi do not offer it for miss smithâ€™s collection,â€ said he. â€œbeing my friendâ€™s, i have no right to

she was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations, which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the eagerness of harrietâ€™s wondering questions.
â€œwhat can it be, miss woodhouse?â€”what can it be? i have not an ideaâ€”i cannot guess it in the least. what can it possibly be? do try to find it out, miss woodhouse. do help me. i never saw any thing so hard. is it kingdom? i wonder who the friend wasâ€”and who could be the young lady. do you think it is a good one? can it be woman?

er! i am very happy. i congratulate you, my dear harriet, with all my heart. this is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating. this is a connexion which offers nothing but good. it will give you every thing that you wantâ€”consideration, independence, a proper homeâ€”it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends, close to hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy for ever. this, harriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us.â€
â€œdear miss woodhouse!â€â€”and â€œdear miss woodhouse,â€ was all that harriet, with many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they did arrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered just as she ought. mr. eltonâ€™s superiority had very ample acknowledgment.
â€œwhatever you say is always right,â€ cried harriet, â€œand therefore i suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise i could not have imagined i

emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of mr. martinâ€™s prose.
â€œsuch sweet lines!â€ continued harrietâ€”â€œthese two last!â€”but how shall i ever be able to return the paper, or say i have found it out?â€”oh! miss woodhouse, what can we do about that?â€

â€œoh! noâ€”i hope i shall not be ridiculous about it. do as you please.â€
mr. woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of â€œwell, my dears, how does your book go on?â€”have you got any thing fresh?â€
â€œyes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. a piece of paper was found on the table this morningâ€”(dropt, we suppose, by a fairy)â€”containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied it in.â€

â€œit would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor isabella were to be anywhere but at hartfield.â€
mr. woodhouse could never allow for mr. knightleyâ€™s claims on his brother, or any bodyâ€™s claims on isabella, except his own. he sat musing a little while, and then said,
â€œbut i do not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back so soon, though he does. i think, emma, i shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us. she and the children might stay very well.â€
â€œah! papaâ€”that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and i do not think you ever will. isabella cannot bear to stay beh

this was too true for contradiction. unwelcome as it was, mr. woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh; and as emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughterâ€™s attachment to her husband, she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.
â€œharriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here. i am sure she will be pleased with the children. we are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? i wonder which she will think the handsomest, henry or john?â€

later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four oâ€™clock dinner, the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again. harriet turned away; but emma could receive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a pushâ€”of having thrown a die; and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up. his ostensible reason, however, was to ask whether mr. woodhouseâ€™s party could be made up in the evening without him, or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at hartfield. if he were, every thing else must give way; but otherwise his friend cole had been saying so much about his dining with himâ€”had made such a point of it, that he had promised him conditionally to come.
emma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account; her father was sure of his rubber. he re-urgedâ€”she re-declined; and he seemed th

ity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors and probabilities, emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with mr. eltonâ€™s seeing ready wit in her.
â€œi wish we could contrive it,â€ said she; â€œbut i cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in;â€”no servant that i want to inquire about of his housekeeperâ€”no message from my father.â€
she pondered, but could think of nothing. after a mutual silence of some minutes, harriet thus began againâ€”
â€œi do so wonder, miss woodhouse, that you should not be married, or going to be married! so charming as you are!â€â€”
emma laughed, and replied,
â€œmy being charming, harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry; i must find other people charmingâ€”one other person at least. and i am not only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little intention of ever marrying at all.â€

the less they will do for themselves.
mr. and mrs. john knightley, from having been longer than usual absent from surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest. till this year, every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between hartfield and donwell abbey; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their surry connexions, or seen at all by mr. woodhouse, who could not be induced to get so far as london, even for poor isabellaâ€™s sake; and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit.
he thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms were needless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and mr. and mrs. john knightley, their five children,

ch isabella never felt herself. perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to isabellaâ€™s sister, but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without praise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectful forbearance towards her father. there he had not always the patience that could have been wished. mr. woodhouseâ€™s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill-bestowed. it did not often happen; for mr. john knightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law, and generally a strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too often for emmaâ€™s charity, especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured, though the offence came not. the beginning, however, of every visit displayed none but the properes

t feelings, and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality. they had not been long seated and composed when mr. woodhouse, with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his daughterâ€™s attention to the sad change at hartfield since she had been there last.
â€œah, my dear,â€ said he, â€œpoor miss taylorâ€”it is a grievous business.â€
â€œoh yes, sir,â€ cried she with ready sympathy, â€œhow you must miss her! and dear emma, too!â€”what a dreadful loss to you both!â€”i have been so grieved for you.â€”i could not imagine how you could possibly do without her.â€”it is a sad change indeed.â€”but i hope she i

mr. john knightley here asked emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of randalls.
â€œoh! noâ€”none in the least. i never saw mrs. weston better in my lifeâ€”never looking so well. papa is only speaking his own regret.â€
â€œvery much to the honour of both,â€ was the handsome reply.
â€œand do you see her, sir, tolerably often?â€ asked isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father.
mr. woodhouse hesitated.â€”â€œnot near so often, my dear, as i could wish.â€
â€œoh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married. either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one, have we seen either mr. weston or mrs. weston, and generally both, either at randalls or hereâ€”and as you may suppose, isabella, most frequently here. they are very, very kind in their visits. mr. weston is really as kind as herself. papa, if you speak in that melancholy way, you will be givi

urselves anticipatedâ€”which is the exact truth.â€
â€œjust as it should be,â€ said mr. john knightley, â€œand just as i hoped it was from your letters. her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy. i have been always telling you, my love, that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended; and now you have emmaâ€™s account, i hope you will be satisfied.â€
â€œwhy, to be sure,â€ said mr. woodhouseâ€”â€œyes, certainlyâ€”i cannot deny that mrs. weston, poor mrs. weston, does come and see us pretty oftenâ€”but thenâ€”she is always obliged to go away again.â€
â€œit would be very hard upon mr. weston if she did not, papa.â€”you quite forget poor mr. weston.â€
â€œi think, indeed,â€ said john knightley pleasantly, â€œthat mr. weston has some little claim. you and i, emma, will venture to take the part of the poor husband. i, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the claims of the man ma

eston, and had half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it pass. she would keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home to himself, whence resulted her brotherâ€™s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it was important.â€”it had a high claim to forbearance.




chapter xii

mr. knightley was to dine with themâ€”rather against the inclination of mr. woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him in isabellaâ€™s first day. emmaâ€™s sense of right however had decided it; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she had particular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreement between mr. knightley and herself, in procuring him the proper invitation.
she hoped they might now become friends again. she thought it was time to make up. making-up indeed would not do. she certainly had not been in the wrong, an

this had just taken place and with great cordiality, when john knightley made his appearance, and â€œhow dâ€™ye do, george?â€ and â€œjohn, how are you?â€ succeeded in the true english style, burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment which would have led either of them, if requisite, to do every thing for the good of the other.
the evening was quiet and conversable, as mr. woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear isabella, and the little party made two natural divisions; on one side he and his daughter; on the other the two mr. knightleys; their subjects totally distinct, or very rarely mixingâ€”and emma only occasionally joining in one or the other.
the brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally of those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative, and who was always the greater talker. as

whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life, and whose attachments were strong. the plan of a drain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree, and the destination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn, was entered into with as much equality of interest by john, as his cooler manners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about, his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness.
while they were thus comfortably occupied, mr. woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.
â€œmy poor dear isabella,â€ said he, fondly taking her hand, and interrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one of her five childrenâ€”â€œhow long it is, how terribly long since you were here! and how tired you must be after your journey! you must go to bed early, my dearâ€”and i recommend a little gruel to you before you go.â€”you and i will have a nice basin of gruel together. my dear emma, sup

mr. woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,
â€œour little friend harriet smith, however, is just such another pretty kind of young person. you will like harriet. emma could not have a better companion than harriet.â€
â€œi am most happy to hear itâ€”but only jane fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior!â€”and exactly emmaâ€™s age.â€

â€œah!â€ said mr. woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern.â€”the ejaculation in emmaâ€™s ear expressed, â€œah! there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to south end. it does not bear talking of.â€ and for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel. after an interval of some minutes, however, he began with,

mr. woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously, been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;â€”but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil, and the immediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections of the other, prevented any renewal of it.

in general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too, there was no avoiding, though at christmas. mr. weston would take no denial; they must all dine at randalls one day;â€”even mr. woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party.
how they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if he could, but as his son and daughterâ€™s carriage and horses were actually at hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for harriet also.

the evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that mr. woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of december) had been spent by harriet at hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by mrs. goddard, emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. emma called on her the next day, and found her doom already signed with regard to randalls. she was very feverish and had a bad sore throat: mrs. goddard was full of care and affection, mr. perry was talked of, and harriet herself was too ill

â€œi thank you; but i assure you you are quite mistaken. mr. elton and i are very good friends, and nothing more;â€ and she walked on, amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, and in want of counsel. he said no more.
mr. woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that in spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at randalls to see that it was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. the cold, however, was severe; and by the time the se

mr. john knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure

rst gratifications of each.
this was a pleasure which perhaps the whole dayâ€™s visit might not afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but the very sight of mrs. weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was grateful to emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of mr. eltonâ€™s oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost.
the misfortune of harrietâ€™s cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival. mr. woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it, besides all the history of his own and isabellaâ€™s coming, and of emmaâ€™s being to follow, and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that james should come and see his daughter, when the others appeared, and mrs. weston, who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away and welcome her dear emma.
emmaâ€™s project of forgetting mr. elton for a while made her rather sorry to find, when

 how unhappy she would have made them!â€
emma wished she had been alone with mrs. weston. she should then have heard more: mrs. weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with isabella; and, she really believed, would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills from her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge. but at present there was nothing more to be said. mr. woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing-room. to be sitting long after dinner, was a confinement that he could not endure. neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable.
while he talked to isabella, however, emma found an opportunity of saying,
â€œand so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain. i am sorry for it. the introduction must be unpleasant, whenever it takes place; and the sooner it

emma listened, and then coolly said, â€œi shall not be satisfied, unless he comes.â€
â€œhe may have a great deal of influence on some points,â€ continued mrs. weston, â€œand on others, very little: and among those, on which she is beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us.â€




chapter xv

mr. woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three companions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. mr. weston was chatty and convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. mr. elton, in very good spirits, was one of the first to walk in. mrs. weston and emma were sitting together on a

â€œso scrupulous for others,â€ he continued, â€œand yet so careless for herself! she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself. is this fair, mrs. weston?â€”judge between us. have not i some righ

 such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses, and then left the sofa, removing to a seat by her sister, and giving her all her attention.
she had not time to know how mr. elton took the reproof, so rapidly did another subject succeed; for mr. john knightley now came into the room from examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing fast, with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to mr. woodhouse:
â€œthis will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements, sir. something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow.â€
poor mr. woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else had something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized, and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. mrs. weston and emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unf

mr. weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest it should make mr. woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his hurrying away. as to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid they would find no difficulty. he wished the road might be impassable, that he might be able to keep them all at randalls; and with the utmost good-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body, calling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little contrivance, every body might be lodged, which she

 hardly knew how to do, from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.
â€œwhat is to be done, my dear emma?â€”what is to be done?â€ was mr. woodhouseâ€™s first exclamation, and all that he could say for some time. to her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, her representation of the excellence of the horses, and of james, and of their having so many friends about them, revived him a little.
his eldest daughterâ€™s alarm was equal to his own. the horror of being blocked up at randalls, while her children were at hartfield, was full in her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people, but in

commending, mr. knightley and emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thusâ€”
â€œyour father will not be easy; why do not you go?â€
â€œi am ready, if the others are.â€
â€œshall i ring the bell?â€
â€œyes, do.â€
and the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. a few minutes more, and emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over.
the carriage came: and mr. woodhouse, always the first object on such occasions, was carefully attended to his own by mr. knightley and mr. weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen, and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for. â€œhe was afraid they should have a very bad drive. he was afraid poor isabella would not like it. and there would be poor emma in the carriage behind. he did not know what they had best do. the

say what emma felt, on hearing thisâ€”which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. she was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for mr. eltonâ€™s sanguine state of mind, he tried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimedâ€”
â€œcharming miss woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting silence. it confesses that you have long understood me.â€
â€œno, sir,â€ cried emma, â€œit confesses no such thing. so far from having long understood you, i have been in a most complete error with respect to your views, till this moment. as to myself, i am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelingsâ€”nothing could be farther from my wishesâ€”your attachment to my friend harrietâ€”your pursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me

he was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually deep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer, for the fears of mr. woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace. if there had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment. without knowing when the carriage turned into vicarage lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves, all at once, at the door of his house; and he was out before another syllable passed.â€”emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night. the compliment was just returned, coldly and

, and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for. there had been no real affection either in his language or manners. sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she could hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice, less allied with real love. she need not trouble herself to pity him. he only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if miss woodhouse of hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for miss somebody else with twenty, or with ten.

perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. the very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior. he must know that the woodhouses had been settled for several generations at hartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient familyâ€”and that the eltons were nobody. the landed property of hartfield certainly was inconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the donwell abbey estate, to which all the rest of highbury belonged; but their fortune, from other sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to donwell abbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the woodhouses had long held a high place in the consi

these were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service, for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present.
the weather was most favourable for her; though christmas day, she could not go to church. mr. woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas. the ground covered with snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, every morning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in to freeze, she was for many days a most honourable prisoner. no intercourse with harriet possible but by note; no churc

chapter xvii

mr. and mrs. john knightley were not detained long at hartfield. the weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move; and mr. woodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children, was obliged to see the whole party set off, and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor isabella;â€”which poor isabella, passing her life with those she doated on, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always innocently busy, might have been a model of right feminine happiness.
the evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from mr. elton to mr. woodhouse, a long, civil, 
 
 ___________________________
 
ceremonious note, to say, with mr. eltonâ€™s best compliments, â€œthat he was proposing to leave highbury the following morning in his way to bath; where, in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends, he had engaged to spend a few weeks, and very much regretted the impossibility he was under, from various circumstances of weather and business, of taking a personal leave of mr. woodhouse, of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful senseâ€”and had mr. woodhouse any commands, should be happy to attend to them.â€
emma was most agreeably surprized.â€”mr. eltonâ€™s absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired. she admired him for contriving it, though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced. resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father, from which she was so pointedly excluded. she had not even a share in his opening compliments.â€”her name was not mentioned;â€”and the

it did, however.â€”her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey, and his fears that mr. elton might never get safely to the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language. it was a very useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening. mr. woodhouse talked over his alarms, and emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude.
she now resolved to keep harriet no longer in the dark. she had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentlemanâ€™s return. she went to mrs. goddardâ€™s accordingly the very next day, to undergo the necessary penance of communication; and a severe one it wa

opinion of herself, as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend.
emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost; and all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching, seemed on harrietâ€™s side, not her own. harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of. the affection of such a man as mr. elton would have been too great a distinction.â€”she never could have deserved himâ€”and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as miss woodhouse would have thought it possible.
her tears fell abundantlyâ€”but her grief was so truly artless, that no dignity could have made it more respectable in emmaâ€™s eyesâ€”and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understandingâ€”really for the time convinced that harriet was the superior creature of the twoâ€”and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do.

the house belonged to people in business. mrs. and miss bates occupied the drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized apartment, which was every thing to them, the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to give up her place to miss woodhouse, and her more active, talking daughter, almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after mr. woodhouseâ€™s health, cheerful communications about her motherâ€™s, and sweet-cake from the beaufetâ€”â€œmrs. cole had just been there, just called in for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour with them, and she had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much; and, therefore, she h

the mention of the coles was sure to be followed by that of mr. elton. there was intimacy between them, and mr. cole had heard from mr. elton since his going away. emma knew what was coming; they must have the letter over again, and settle how long he had been gone, and how much he was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever he went, and how full the master of the ceremoniesâ€™ ball had been; and she went through it

all this spoken extremely fast obliged miss bates to stop for breath; and emma said something very civil about the excellence of miss fairfaxâ€™s handwriting.
â€œyou are extremely kind,â€ replied miss bates, highly gratified; â€œyou who are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself. i am sure there is nobodyâ€™s praise that could give us so much pleasure as miss woodhouseâ€™s. my mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know. maâ€™am,â€ addressing her, â€œdo you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say about janeâ€™s handwriting?â€
and emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it. she was pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming very rude, of making her escape from jane fairfaxâ€™s letter, and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under

chapter iii

emma could not forgive her;â€”but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by mr. knightley, who had been of the party, and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he was expressing the next morning, being at hartfield again on business with mr. woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room, but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to emma. he had been used to think her unjust to jane, and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement.
â€œa very pleasant evening,â€ he began, as soon as mr. woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary, told that he understood, and the papers swept away;â€”â€œparticularly pleasant. you and miss fairfax gave us some very good music

â€œoh! no; i was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions; and amused to think how little information i obtained.â€
â€œi am disappointed,â€ was his only answer.
â€œi hope every body had a pleasant evening,â€ said mr. woodhouse, in his quiet way. â€œi had. once, i felt the fire rather too much; but then i moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me. miss bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she always is, though she speaks rather too quick. however, she is very agreeable, and mrs. bates too, in a different way. i like old friends; and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a very well-behaved young lady indeed. she must have found the evening agreeabl

â€œtrue, sir; and emma, because she had miss fairfax.â€
emma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the present, said, and with a sincerity which no one could questionâ€”
â€œshe is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep oneâ€™s eyes from. i am always watching her to admire; and i do pity her from my heart.â€
mr. knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express; and before he could make any reply, mr. woodhouse, whose thoughts were on the batesâ€™s, saidâ€”
â€œit is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined! a great pity indeed! and i have often wishedâ€”but it is so little one can venture to doâ€”small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommonâ€”now we have killed a porker, and emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg; it is very small and delicateâ€”hartfield pork is not like any other porkâ€”but still it is porkâ€”and, my dear emma, unless one could be sure of their making it i

â€œoh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? my dear miss woodhouseâ€”i come quite over-powered. such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork! you are too bountiful! have you heard the news? mr. elton is going to be married.â€
emma had not had time even to think of mr. elton, and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start, and a little blush, at the sound.

â€œoh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good to us. if ever there were people who, without having great wealth themselves, had every thing they could wish for, i am sure it is us. we may well say that â€˜our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.â€™ well, mr. knightley, and so you actually saw the letter; wellâ€”â€

â€œmr. elton going to be married!â€ said emma, as soon as she could speak. â€œhe will have every bodyâ€™s wishes for his happiness.â€
â€œhe is very young to settle,â€ was mr. woodhouseâ€™s observation. â€œhe had better not be in a hurry. he seemed to me very well off as he was. we were always glad to see him at hartfield.â€
â€œa new neighbour for us all, miss woodhouse!â€ said miss bates, joyfully; â€œmy mother is so pleased!â€”she says she cannot bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress. this is great news, indeed. jane, you have never seen mr. elton!â€”no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him.â€

â€œnoâ€”i have never seen mr. elton,â€ she replied, starting on this appeal; â€œis heâ€”is he a tall man?â€
â€œwho shall answer that question?â€ cried emma. â€œmy father would say â€˜yes,â€™ mr. knightley â€˜no;â€™ and miss bates and i that he is just the happy medium. when you have been here a little longer, miss fairfax, you will understand that mr. elton is the standard of perfection in highbury, both in person and mind.â€

the shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes, when in came harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the â€œoh! miss woodhouse, what do you think has happened!â€ which instantly burst forth, had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation. as the blow was given, emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening; and harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly through what she had to tell. â€œshe had set out from mrs. goddardâ€™s half an hour agoâ€”she had been afraid it would rainâ€”she had been afraid it would pour down every momentâ€”but she thought she might get to hartfield firstâ€”she had hurried on

he got as near as he could to thanking her for miss taylorâ€™s merits, without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that miss taylor had formed miss woodhouseâ€™s character, than miss woodhouse miss taylorâ€™s. and at last, as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object, he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person.
â€œelegant, agreeable manners, i was prepared for,â€ said he; â€œbut i confess that, considering every thing, i had not expected more than a very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; i did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs. weston.â€

â€œif you were never particularly struck by her manners before,â€ said she, â€œi think you will to-day. you will see her to advantage; see her and hear herâ€”no, i am afraid you will not hear her at all, for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue.â€
â€œyou are acquainted with miss jane fairfax, sir, are you?â€ said mr. woodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation; â€œthen give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady. she is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt, very worthy people; i have known them all my life. they will be extremely glad to see you, i am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way.â€

thing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to herâ€”nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection. and there was time enough for emma to form a reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of the morning. they were all three walking about together for an hour or twoâ€”first round the shrubberies of hartfield, and afterwards in highbury. he was delighted with every thing; admired hartfield sufficiently for mr. woodhouseâ€™s ear; and when their going farther was resolved on, confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village, and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than emma could have supposed.
some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. he begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, and which had been the home of his fatherâ€™s father; and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest of her

 ball-room caught him; and instead of passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities, and lament that its original purpose should have ceased. he saw no fault in the room, he would acknowledge none which they suggested. no, it was long enough, broad enough, handsome enough. it would hold the very number for comfort. they ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter. why had not miss woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room?â€”she who could do any thing in highbury! the want of proper families in the place, and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied. he could not be persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him, could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when particulars were given and families described, he was still unwilling to admit

â€œoh! yes, gloves and every thing. i do admire your patriotism. you will be adored in highbury. you were very popular before you came, because you were mr. westonâ€™s sonâ€”but lay out half a guinea at fordâ€™s, and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues.â€
they went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of â€œmenâ€™s beaversâ€ and â€œyork tanâ€ were bringing down and displaying on the counter, he saidâ€”â€œbut i beg your pardon, miss woodhouse, you were speaking to me, you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my amor patriae. do not let me lose it. i assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life.â€
â€œi merely asked, whether you had known much of miss fairfax and her party at weymouth.â€

she owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely without inclination for the party. the coles expressed themselves so properlyâ€”there was so much real attention in the manner of itâ€”so much consideration for her father. â€œthey would have solicited the honour earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from london, which they hoped might keep mr. woodhouse from any draught of air, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company.â€ upon the whole, she was very persuadable; and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfortâ€”how certainly mrs. goddard, if not mrs. bates, might be depended on for bearing him companyâ€”mr. woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughterâ€™s going out to dinner on a day now near at hand, and spending the whole evening awa

â€œwell, sir,â€ cried mr. weston, â€œas i took miss taylor away, it is incumbent on me to supply her place, if i can; and i will step to mrs. goddard in a moment, if you wish it.â€
but the idea of any thing to be done in a moment, was increasing, not lessening, mr. woodhouseâ€™s agitation. the ladies knew better how to allay it. mr. weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately arranged.
with this treatment, mr. woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual. â€œhe should be happy to see mrs. goddard. he had a great regard for mrs. goddard; and emma should write a line, and invite her. james could take the note. but first of all, there must be an answer written to mrs. cole.â€

â€œoh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. there will be a great many people talking at once. you will not like the noise.â€
â€œbut, my dear sir,â€ cried mr. weston, â€œif emma comes away early, it will be breaking up the party.â€
â€œand no great harm if it does,â€ said mr. woodhouse. â€œthe sooner every party breaks up, the better.â€
â€œbut you do not consider how it may appear to the coles. emmaâ€™s going away directly after tea might be giving offence. they are good-natured people, and think little of their own claims; but still they must feel that any bodyâ€™s hurrying away is no great compliment; and miss woodhouseâ€™s doing it would be more thought of than any other personâ€™s in the room. you would not wish to disappoint and mortify the coles, i am sure, sir; friend

chapter viii

frank churchill came back again; and if he kept his fatherâ€™s dinner waiting, it was not known at hartfield; for mrs. weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with mr. woodhouse, to betray any imperfection which could be concealed.
he came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with a very good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done. he had no reason to wish his hair longer, to conceal any confusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve his spirits. he was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, after seeing him, emma thus moralised to herself:â€”

miss woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of mrs. coleâ€™s, turned to frank churchill.
â€œwhy do you smile?â€ said she.
â€œnay, why do you?â€
â€œme!â€”i suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbellâ€™s being so rich and so liberal.â€”it is a handsome present.â€

they were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of the early was frank churchill. in he walked, the first and the handsomest; and after paying his compliments en passant to miss bates and her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle, where sat miss woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her, would not sit at all. emma divined what every body present must be thinking. she was his object, and every body must perceive it. she introduced him to her friend, miss smith, and, at convenient moments afterwards, heard what each thought of the other. â€œhe had never seen so lovely a face, and was delighted with her naivete.â€ and she, â€œonly to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment, but she did think there were some looks a little like mr. e

they combated the point some time longer in the same way; emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for mrs. weston was the most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;â€”and at the same moment mr. cole approaching to entreat miss woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it. frank churchill, of whom, in the eagerness of her conversation with mrs. weston, she had been seeing nothing, except that he had found a seat by miss fairfax, followed mr. cole, to add his very pressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it suited emma best to lead, she gave a very proper compliance.
she knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little t

miss bates, in her real anxiety for jane, could hardly stay even to be grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing. here ceased the concert part of the evening, for miss woodhouse and miss fairfax were the only young lady performers; but soon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancingâ€”originating nobody exactly knew whereâ€”was so effectually promoted by mr. and mrs. cole, that every thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space. mrs. weston, capital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning an irresistible waltz; and frank churchill, coming up with most becoming gallantry to emma, had secured her hand, and led her up to the top.

mrs. weston was disappointed.
â€œi thought you meant to go with me. they would be very much pleased.â€
â€œme! i should be quite in the way. but, perhapsâ€”i may be equally in the way here. miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me. my aunt always sends me off when she is shopping. she says i fidget her to death; and miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same. what am i to do?â€

â€œoh! very delightful indeed; i can say nothing less, for i suppose miss woodhouse and mr. frank churchill are hearing every thing that passes. and (raising his voice still more) i do not see why miss fairfax should not be mentioned too. i think miss fairfax dances very well; and mrs. weston is the very best country-dance player, without exception, in england. now, if your friends have any gratitude, they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return; but i cannot stay to hear it.â€

emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was perceived to be gone, that mrs. weston and her companion taking leave also, could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to hartfield gates, before they set off for randalls.

frank churchill had danced once at highbury, and longed to dance again; and the last half-hour of an evening which mr. woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at randalls, was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject. frankâ€™s was the first idea; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance. but still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully mr. frank churchill and miss woodhouse dancedâ€”for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with jane f

the doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. â€œmight not they use both rooms, and dance across the passage?â€ it seemed the best scheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better. emma said it would be awkward; mrs. weston was in distress about the supper; and mr. woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score of health. it made him so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be persevered in.
â€œoh! no,â€ said he; â€œit would be the extreme of imprudence. i could not bear it for emma!â€”emma is not strong. she would catch a dreadful cold. so would poor little harriet. so you would all. mrs. weston, you would be quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing. pray do not let them talk of it. that young man (speaking lower) is very thoughtless. do not tell

â€œvery true,â€ he gravely replied; â€œit was very bad.â€ but still he went on measuring, and still he ended with,
â€œi think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.â€
â€œno, no,â€ said she, â€œyou are quite unreasonable. it would be dreadful to be standing so close! nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowdâ€”and a crowd in a little room!â€
â€œthere is no denying it,â€ he replied. â€œi agree with you exactly. a crowd in a little roomâ€”miss woodhouse, you have the art of giving pictures in a few words. exquisite, quite exquisite!â€”still, however, having proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up. it would be a disappointment to my fatherâ€”and altogetherâ€”i do not know thatâ€”i am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well.â€
emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her; but she took the compliment, and

forgave the rest. had she intended ever to marry him, it might have been worth while to pause and consider, and try to understand the value of his preference, and the character of his temper; but for all the purposes of their acquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.
before the middle of the next day, he was at hartfield; and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme. it soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.
â€œwell, miss woodhouse,â€ he almost immediately began, â€œyour inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away, i hope, by the terrors of my fatherâ€™s little rooms. i bring a new proposal on the subject:â€”a thought of my fatherâ€™s, which waits only your approbation to be acted upon. may i hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball, to be given, not at randalls, but at the crown inn?â€

in the room at the crown in his lifeâ€”did not know the people who kept it by sight.â€”oh! noâ€”a very bad plan. they would catch worse colds at the crown than anywhere.â€
â€œi was going to observe, sir,â€ said frank churchill, â€œthat one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any bodyâ€™s catching coldâ€”so much less danger at the crown than at randalls! mr. perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but nobody else could.â€
â€œsir,â€ said mr. woodhouse, rather warmly, â€œyou are very much mistaken if you suppose mr. perry to be that sort of character. mr. perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill. but i do not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you than your fatherâ€™s house.â€
â€œfrom the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. we shall have no occasion to open the windows at allâ€”not once the whole evening; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon heated bodies, which

does.â€”fine dancing, i believe, like virtue, must be its own reward. those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different.â€
this emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry. it was not in compliment to jane fairfax however that he was so indifferent, or so indignant; he was not guided by her feelings in reprobating the ball, for she enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree. it made her animatedâ€”open heartedâ€”she voluntarily said;â€”
â€œoh! miss woodhouse, i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball. what a disappointment it would be! i do look forward to it, i own, with very great pleasure.â€
it was not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of william larkins. no!â€”she was more and more convinced that mrs. weston was quite mistaken in that surmise. there was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his sideâ€”but no love.

â€œindeed, i am very sorry to be right in this instance. i would much rather have been merry than wise.â€
â€œif i can come again, we are still to have our ball. my father depends on it. do not forget your engagement.â€
emma looked graciously.
â€œsuch a fortnight as it has been!â€ he continued; â€œevery day more precious and more delightful than the day before!â€”every day making me less fit to bear any other place. happy those, who can remain at highbury!â€

â€œyesâ€”i have called there; passing the door, i thought it better. it was a right thing to do. i went in for three minutes, and was detained by miss batesâ€™s being absent. she was out; and i felt it impossible not to wait till she came in. she is a woman that one may, that one must laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. it was better to pay my visit, thenâ€â€”
he hesitated, got up, walked to a window.
â€œin short,â€ said he, â€œperhaps, miss woodhouseâ€”i think you can hardly be quite without suspicionâ€â€”
he looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts. she hardly knew what to say. it seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious, which she did not wish. forcing herself to speak, therefore, in the hope of putting it by, she calmly said,
â€œyou are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit, thenâ€â€”
he was silent. she believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting on what she had said, and trying to

â€œit was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to hartfield. my regard for hartfield is most warmâ€â€”
he stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.â€”he was more in love with her than emma had supposed; and who can say how it might have ended, if his father had not made his appearance? mr. woodhouse soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made him composed.
a very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial. mr. weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that was doubtful, said, â€œit was time to go;â€ and the young man, though he might and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave.

g exterior and local that could be supposed attractive, with spirit and precision. no suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern; it was the language of real feeling towards mrs. weston; and the transition from highbury to enscombe, the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety.â€”the charm of her own name was not wanting. miss woodhouse appeared more than once, and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either a compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said; and in the very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed. compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these wordsâ€”â€œi had not a spare moment on tuesday, as you know, for mi

poor harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that emma could give. emma felt that she could not do too much for her, that harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience; but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect, for ever agreed to, without being able to make their opinions the same. harriet listened submissively, and said â€œit was very trueâ€”it was just as miss woodhouse describedâ€”it was not worth while to think about themâ€”and she would not think about them any longerâ€ but no change of subject could avail, and the next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the eltons as before. at last emma attacked her on another ground.
â€œyour allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about mr. eltonâ€™s marrying, harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make me. you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i fell into. it was all my doi

this appeal to her affections did more than all the rest. the idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for miss woodhouse, whom she really loved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when the violence of grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably.
â€œyou, who have been the best friend i ever had in my lifeâ€”want gratitude to you!â€”nobody is equal to you!â€”i care for nobody as i do for you!â€”oh! miss woodhouse, how ungrateful i have been!â€
such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do,

â€œwell, miss woodhouse,â€ said harriet, when they had quitted the house, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin; â€œwell, miss woodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?â€”is not she very charming?â€
there was a little hesitation in emmaâ€™s answer.
â€œoh! yesâ€”veryâ€”a very pleasing young woman.â€
â€œi think her beautiful, quite beautiful.â€
â€œvery nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.â€

â€œi dare say,â€ returned harriet, sighing again, â€œi dare say she was very much attached to him.â€
â€œperhaps she might; but it is not every manâ€™s fate to marry the woman who loves him best. miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought this the best offer she was likely to have.â€
â€œyes,â€ said harriet earnestly, â€œand well she might, nobody could ever have a better. well, i wish them happy with all my heart. and now, miss woodhouse, i do not think i shall mind seeing them again. he is just as superior as ever;â€”but being married, you know, it is quite a different thing. no, indeed, miss woodhouse, you need not be afraid; i can sit and admire him now without any great misery. to know that he has not thrown himself away, is such a comfort!â€”she does seem a charming young woman, just what he deserves. happy creature! he called her â€˜augusta.â€™ how delightful!â€

â€œand the staircaseâ€”you know, as i came in, i observed how very like the staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. i really could not help exclaiming! i assure you, miss woodhouse, it is very delightful to me, to be reminded of a place i am so extremely partial to as maple grove. i have spent so many happy months there! (with a little sigh of sentiment). a charming place, undoubtedly. every body who sees it is struck by its beauty; but to me, it has been quite a home. whenever you are transplanted, like me, miss woodhouse, you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind. i always say this is quite one of the evils

it was as much as emma could bear, without being impolite. the idea of her being indebted to mrs. elton for what was called an introductionâ€”of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of mrs. eltonâ€™sâ€”probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!â€”the dignity of miss woodhouse, of hartfield, was sunk indeed!
she restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could have given, and only thanked mrs. elton coolly; â€œbut their going to bath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father.â€ and then, to prevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly.

â€œno, indeed, i have no doubts at all on that head. i am delighted to find myself in such a circle. i hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together. i think, miss woodhouse, you and i must establish a musical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours. will not it be a good plan? if we exert ourselves, i think we shall not be long in want of allies. something of that nature would be particularly desirable for me, as an inducement to keep me in practice; for married women, you knowâ€”there is a sad story against them, in general. they are but too apt to give up music.â€

there was no reason to suppose mr. elton thought at all differently from his wife. he seemed not merely happy with her, but proud. he had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to highbury, as not even miss woodhouse could equal; and the greater part of her new acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of judging, following the lead of miss batesâ€™s good-will, or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself, were very well satisfied; so that mrs. eltonâ€™s praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded by miss woodhouse, who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being â€œvery pleasa

mrs. elton took a great fancy to jane fairfax; and from the first. not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admirationâ€”but without solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting to assist and befriend her.â€”bef

emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner at hartfield for the eltons. they must not do less than others, or she should be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitiful resentment. a dinner there must be. after emma had talked about it for ten minutes, mr. woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself, with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him.
the persons to be invited, required little thought. besides the eltons, it must be the westons and mr. knightley; so far it was all of courseâ€”and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little harriet must be asked to make the eighth:â€”but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction, and on many account

she comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, by representing that though he certainly would make them nine, yet he always said so little, that the increase of noise would be very immaterial

the event was more favourable to mr. woodhouse than to emma. john knightley came; but mr. weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day. he might be able to join them in the evening, but certainly not to dinner. mr. woodhouse was quite at ease; and the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate, removed the chief of even emmaâ€™s vexation.
the day came, the party were punctually assembled, and mr. john knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable. instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner, he was talking to miss fairfax. mrs. elton, as elegant as lace and pearls could make her, he

â€œi am very sorry to hear, miss fairfax, of your being out this morning in the rain. young ladies should take care of themselves.â€”young ladies are delicate plants. they should take care of their health and their complexion. my dear, did you change your stockings?â€

in this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till mr. woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change of object, and emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to jane,
â€œhere comes this dear old beau of mine, i protest!â€”only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men!â€”what a dear creature he is;â€”i assure you i like him excessively. i admire all that quaint, old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease; modern ease often disgusts me. but this good old mr. woodhouse, i wish you had heard his gal

mr. weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative to want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say, and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already.
it was well that he took every bodyâ€™s joy for granted, or he might not have thought either mr. woodhouse or mr. knightley particularly delighted. they were the first entitled, after mrs. weston and emma, to be made happy;â€”from them he would have proceeded to miss fairfax, but she was so deep in conversation with john knightley, that it would have been too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to mrs. elton, and her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subject with her.

mr. woodhouse was resigned. the time of year lightened the evil to him. may was better for every thing than february. mrs. bates was engaged to spend the evening at hartfield, james had due notice, and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little henry nor dear little john would have any thing the matter with them, while dear emma were gone.

frank turned instantly to emma, to claim her former promise; and boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfect approbation ofâ€”and it then appeared that mrs. weston was wanting him to dance with mrs. elton himself, and that their business was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.â€”mr. weston and mrs. elton led the way, mr. frank churchill and miss woodhouse followed. emma must submit to stand second to mrs. elton, though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her. it was almost enough to make her think of marrying. mrs. elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified; for though she had intended to begin with frank churchill, she could not lose by the change. mr. weston might be his sonâ€™s superior.â€”in spite of this little rub, however, emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see the respect

emmaâ€™s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed,â€”aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion: but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible. within half an hour it was known all over highbury. it was the very event to engage those who talk most, the young and the low; and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news. the last nightâ€™s ball seemed lost in the gipsies. poor mr. woodhouse trembled as he sat, and, as emma had foreseen, would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again. it was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and miss woodhouse (for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after), as well as miss smith, were coming in during the rest of the day; and he had the pleasure of returning for answer, that they were all very indifferentâ€”which, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly well, and h

o a matter of little importance but to emma and her nephews:â€”in her imagination it maintained its ground, and henry and john were still asking every day for the story of harriet and the gipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital.




chapter iv

a very few days had passed after this adventure, when harriet came one morning to emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after sitting down and hesitating, thus began:
â€œmiss woodhouseâ€”if you are at leisureâ€”i have something that i should like to tell youâ€”a sort of confession to makeâ€”and then, you know, it will be over.â€
emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak. there was a seriousness in harrietâ€™s manner which prepared her, quite as much as her words, for something more than ordinary.
â€œit is my duty, and i am sure it is my wish,â€ she continued, â€œto have no reserves with you on this subject. as i am happily quite an altered creature in one resp

he had previously determined how far she would proceed, on any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.â€”she was decided, and thus spokeâ€”
â€œharriet, i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. your resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you. is not it so?â€
â€œoh! miss woodhouse, believe me i have not the presumption to supposeâ€” indeed i am not so mad.â€”but it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distanceâ€”and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so proper, in me especially.â€

; but there were symptoms of intelligence between themâ€”he thought so at leastâ€”symptoms of admiration on his side, which, having once observed, he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning, however he might wish to escape any of emmaâ€™s errors of imagination. she was not present when the suspicion first arose. he was dining with the randalls family, and jane, at the eltonsâ€™; and he had seen a look, more than a single look, at miss fairfax, which, from the admirer of miss woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place. when he was again in their company, he could not help remembering what he had seen; nor could he avoid observations which, unless it were like cowper and his fire at twilight,
â€œmyself creating what i saw,â€
brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking, of private understanding even, between frank churchill and jane.
he had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to spend his evening at hartfield. emma and harriet

their exercise early, as the weather threatened rain; mr. and mrs. weston and their son, miss bates and her niece, who had accidentally met. they all united; and, on reaching hartfield gates, emma, who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father, pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him. the randalls party agreed to it immediately; and after a pretty long speech from miss bates, which few persons listened to, she also found it possible to accept dear miss woodhouseâ€™s most obliging invitation.
as they were turning into the grounds, mr. perry passed by on horseback. the gentlemen spoke of his horse.
â€œby the bye,â€ said frank churchill to mrs. weston presently, â€œwhat became of mr. perryâ€™s plan of setting up his carriage?â€
mrs. weston looked surprized, and said, â€œi did not know that he ever had any such plan.â€
â€œnay, i had it from you. you wrote me word of it three months ago.â€

 and looked at neither.
there was no time for farther remark or explanation. the dream must be borne with, and mr. knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield, and which none but emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use, instead of the small-sized pembroke, on which two of his daily meals had, for forty years been crowded. tea passed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.
â€œmiss woodhouse,â€ said frank churchill, after examining a table behind him, which he could reach as he sat, â€œhave your nephews taken away their alphabetsâ€”their box of letters? it used to stand here. where is it? this is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer. we had great amusement with those letters one morning. i want to puzzle you again.â€
emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which

 no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves. they were rapidly forming words for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. the quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for mr. woodhouse, who had often been distressed by the more animated sort, which mr. weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure of the â€œpoor little boys,â€ or in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letter near him, how beautifully emma had written it.

 with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction which silenced, mr. knightley. she was in gay spirits, and would have prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her: but his gaiety did not meet hers. he found he could not be useful, and his feelings were too much irritated for talking. that he might not be irritated into an absolute fever, by the fire which mr. woodhouseâ€™s tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year, he soon afterwards took a hasty leave, and walked home to the coolness and solitude of donwell abbey.




chapter vi

â€œthat i am sure you would. indeed i do you justice, my good friend. under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, i know you have the warmest heart. as i tell mr. e., you are a thorough humourist.â€”yes, believe me, knightley, i am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme. you have hit upon the very thing to please me.â€
mr. knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade. he wished to persuade mr. woodhouse, as well as emma, to join the party; and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill. mr. woodhouse must not, under the specious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent at donwell, be tempted away to his misery.
he was invited on good faith. no lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity. he did consent. he had not been at donwell for two years. â€œsome very fine morning, he, and emma, and harriet, could go very we

in the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to box hill was again under happy consideration; and at last donwell was settled for one day, and box hill for the next,â€”the weather appearing exactly right.
under a bright mid-day sun, at almost midsummer, mr. woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake of this al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the abbey, especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning, he was happily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and not to heat themselves.â€”mrs. weston, who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him, remained, when all the

the cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen, the old abbey fish-ponds; perhaps get as far as the clover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or, at any rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and growing cool again.â€”mr. woodhouse, who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens, where no damps from the river were imagined even by him, stirred no more; and his daughter resolved to remain with him, that mrs. weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need.
mr. knightley had done all in his power for mr. woodhouseâ€™s entertainment. books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals, shells, and every other family collection within his

â€œthank you, thank youâ€”but on no account.â€”i would rather walk.â€”and for me to be afraid of walking alone!â€”i, who may so soon have to guard others!â€

â€œi am,â€â€”she answeredâ€”â€œi am fatigued; but it is not the sort of fatigueâ€”quick walking will refresh me.â€”miss woodhouse, we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits. mine, i confess, are exhausted. the greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let me have my own way, and only say that i am gone when it is necessary.â€
emma had not another word to oppose. she saw it all; and entering into her feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately, and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend. her parting look was gratefulâ€”and her parting words, â€œoh! miss woodhouse, the comfort of bein

â€œyou will soon be cooler, if you sit still,â€ said emma.
â€œas soon as i am cooler i shall go back again. i could very ill be sparedâ€”but such a point had been made of my coming! you will all be going soon i suppose; the whole party breaking up. i met one as i cameâ€”madness in such weather!â€”absolute madness!â€

they had a very fine day for box hill; and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in favour of a pleasant party. mr. weston directed the whole, officiating safely between hartfield and the vicarage, and every body was in good time. emma and harriet went together; miss bates and her niece, with the eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. mrs. weston remained with mr. woodhouse. nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there. seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency. there was a languor, a want of spirits, a want of union, which could not be got over. they separated too much into parties. the eltons walked together; mr. knightley took charge of miss bates and jane; and emma and harriet belonged to frank churchill. and mr. weston

â€œis miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of?â€

â€œno, not mr. knightley; he declined it from the first; and though i thought he would come, because mrs. elton declared she would not let him off, he did not;â€”but my mother, and jane, and i, were all there, and a very agreeable evening we had. such kind friends, you know, miss woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemed rather fagged after the morningâ€™s party. even pleasure, you know, is fatiguingâ€”and i cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it. however, i shall always think it a very pleasant party, and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it.â€

same distressing and delicate office to perform by harriet, which mrs. weston had just gone through by herself. the intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to her, she was now to be anxiously announcing to another. her heart beat quick on hearing harrietâ€™s footstep and voice; so, she supposed, had poor mrs. weston felt when she was approaching randalls. could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!â€”but of that, unfortunately, there could be no chance.
â€œwell, miss woodhouse!â€ cried harriet, coming eagerly into the roomâ€”â€œis not this the oddest news that ever was?â€
â€œwhat news do you mean?â€ replied emma, unable to guess, by look or voice, whether harriet could indeed have received any hint.
â€œabout jane fairfax. did you ever hear any thing so strange? oh!â€”you need not be afraid of owning it to me, for mr. weston has told me himself. i met him just now. he told me it was to be a great secret; and, therefore, i should not think of mentioning it to any bo

â€œme!â€ cried harriet, colouring, and astonished. â€œwhy should you caution me?â€”you do not think i care about mr. frank churchill.â€
â€œi am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,â€ replied emma, smiling; â€œbut you do not mean to deny that there was a timeâ€”and not very distant eitherâ€”when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him?â€
â€œhim!â€”never, never. dear miss woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?â€ turning away distressed.
â€œharriet!â€ cried emma, after a momentâ€™s pauseâ€”â€œwhat do you mean?â€”good heaven! what do you mean?â€”mistake you!â€”am i to suppose then?â€”â€
she could not speak another word.â€”her voice was lost; and she sat down, waiting in great terror till harriet should answer.
harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned from her, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak, it was in a voice nearly as

â€œoh! miss woodhouse, how you do forget!â€
â€œmy dear harriet, i perfectly remember the substance of what i said on the occasion. i told you that i did not wonder at your attachment; that considering the service he had rendered you, it was extremely natural:â€”and you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service, and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue.â€”the impression of it is strong on my memory.â€

â€œgood god!â€ cried emma, â€œthis has been a most unfortunateâ€”most deplorable mistake!â€”what is to be done?â€
â€œyou would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me? at least, however, i cannot be worse off than i should have been, if the other had been the person; and nowâ€”it is possibleâ€”â€
she paused a few moments. emma could not speak.
â€œi do not wonder, miss woodhouse,â€ she resumed, â€œthat you should feel a great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body. you must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other. but i hope, miss woodhouse, that supposingâ€”that ifâ€”strange as it may appearâ€”. but you know they were your own words, that more wonderful things had happened, matches of greater disparity had taken place than between mr. frank churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if such a thing even as this, may have o

harriet was standing at one of the windows. emma turned round to look at her in consternation, and hastily said,
â€œhave you any idea of mr. knightleyâ€™s returning your affection?â€
â€œyes,â€ replied harriet modestly, but not fearfullyâ€”â€œi must say that i have.â€
emmaâ€™s eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating, in a fixed attitude, for a few

€”rousing from reflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion, she turned to harriet again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as to the subject which had first introduced it, the wonderful story of jane fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.â€”neither of them thought but of mr. knightley and themselves.
harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad to be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge, and such a friend as miss woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to give the history of her hopes with great, though trembling delight.â€”emmaâ€™s tremblings as she asked, and as she listened, were better concealed than harrietâ€™s, but they were not less. her voice was not unsteady; but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self, such a burst of threatening evil, such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions, must create.â€”she listened with much inward suffering, but with great outward patience, t

t it contained, when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration, a substance to sink her spiritâ€”especially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own memory brought in favour of mr. knightleyâ€™s most improved opinion of harriet.
harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances.â€”emma knew that he had, on that occasion, found her much superior to his expectation. from that evening, or at least from the time of miss woodhouseâ€™s encouraging her to think of him, harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do, and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her; a manner of kindness and sweetness!â€”latterly she had been more and more aware of it. when they had been all walking together, he had so often come and walked by her, and talked so very delightfully!â€”he seemed to want to be acquainted with her. emma knew it to have been very much the case. she had oft

flection, venture the following question. â€œmight he not?â€”is not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, into the state of your affections, he might be alluding to mr. martinâ€”he might have mr. martinâ€™s interest in view? but harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit.
â€œmr. martin! no indeed!â€”there was not a hint of mr. martin. i hope i know better now, than to care for mr. martin, or to be suspected of it.â€
when harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear miss woodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.
â€œi never should have presumed to think of it at first,â€ said she, â€œbut for you. you told me to observe him carefully, and let his behaviour be the rule of mineâ€”and so i have. but now i seem to feel that i may deserve him; and that if he does chuse me, it will not be any thing so very wonderful.â€
the bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter feelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on emmaâ€™s side, to enable her to

harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory; and emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which at that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her fatherâ€™s footsteps. he was coming through the hall. harriet was too much agitated to encounter him. â€œshe could not compose herselfâ€” mr. woodhouse would be alarmedâ€”she had better go;â€â€”with most ready encouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through another doorâ€”and the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous burst of emmaâ€™s feelings: â€œoh god! that i had never seen her!â€

the evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at hartfield. the weather added what it could of gloom. a cold stormy rain set in, and nothing of july appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the wind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made such cruel sights the longer visible.
the weather affected mr. woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughterâ€™s side, and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before. it reminded her of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening of mrs. westonâ€™s wedding-day; but mr. knightley had walked in then, soon after tea, and dissipated every melancholy fancy. alas! such delightful proofs of hartfieldâ€™s attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly be over. the picture which she ha

poor mr. woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.â€”could he have seen the heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs; but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil, without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either, he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from mr. per

â€œthis is most kind, indeed!â€”miss woodhouse, it is impossible for me to expressâ€”i hope you will believeâ€”excuse me for being so entirely without words.â€
emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, if the sound of mrs. eltonâ€™s voice from the sitting-room had not checked her, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand.
mrs. bates and mrs. elton were together. miss bates was out, which accounted for the previous tranquillity.

â€œi mentioned no names, you will observe.â€”oh! no; cautious as a minister of state. i managed it extremely well.â€
emma could not doubt. it was a palpable display, repeated on every possible occasion. when they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and mrs. weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with,
â€œdo not you think, miss woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered?â€”do not you think her cure does perry the highest credit?â€”(here was a side-glance of great meaning at jane.) upon my word, perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!â€”oh! if you had seen her, as i did, when she was at the worst!â€â€”and when mrs. bates was saying something to emma, whispered farther, â€œwe do not say a word of any assistance that perry might have; not a word of a certain young physician from windsor.â€”oh! no; p

soon after this miss bates came in, and emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting, she supposed, from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say every thing.
â€œthank you, dear miss woodhouse, you are all kindness.â€”it is impossible to sayâ€”yes, indeed, i quite understandâ€”dearest janeâ€™s prospectsâ€”that is, i do not mean.â€”but she is charmingly recovered.â€”how is mr. woodhouse?â€”i am so glad.â€”quite out of my power.â€”such a happy little circle as you find us here.â€”yes, indeed.â€”charming young man!â€”that isâ€”so very friendly; i mean good mr. perry!â€”such attention to jane!â€â€”and from her great, her more than commonly thankful delight towards mrs. elton for being there, emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards jane, from the vicarage quarter, which was now graciously overcome.â€”after a few whispers, indeed, which placed it beyon

â€œah! you clever creature, thatâ€™s very true. what a thinking brain you have! i say, jane, what a perfect character you and i should make, if we could be shaken together. my liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection.â€”not that i presume to insinuate, however, that some people may not think you perfection already.â€”but hush!â€”not a word, if you please.â€
it seemed an unnecessary caution; jane was wanting to give her words, not to mrs. elton, but to miss woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw. the wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted, was very evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.
mr. elton made his appearance. his lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity.
â€œvery pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an encumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!â€”but you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. you knew i should not stir till my lord and master appeared.â€”

emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary, indeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.

the time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other personsâ€™ reception of it tried. as soon as mrs. weston was sufficiently recovered to admit mr. woodhouseâ€™s visits, emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved first to announce it at home, and then at randalls.â€”but how to break it to her father at last!â€”she had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of mr. knightleyâ€™s absence, or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her, and she must have put it off; but mr. knightley was to come at such a time, and follow up the beginning she was to make.â€”she was forced to speak, and to s

deny that he did, she was sure.â€”whom did he ever want to consult on business but mr. knightley?â€”who was so useful to him, who so ready to write his letters, who so glad to assist him?â€”who so cheerful, so attentive, so attached to him?â€”would not he like to have him always on the spot?â€”yes. that was all very true. mr. knightley could not be there too often; he should be glad to see him every day;â€”but they did see him every day as it was.â€”why could not they go on as they had done?
mr. woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome, the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.â€”to emmaâ€™s entreaties and assurances succeeded mr. knightleyâ€™s, whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was soon used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.â€”they had all the assistance which isabella could give, by letters of the strongest approbation; and mrs. weston was ready, on the first meeting, to consider the subje

ct in the most serviceable lightâ€”first, as a settled, and, secondly, as a good oneâ€”well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to mr. woodhouseâ€™s mind.â€”it was agreed upon, as what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it, he began to think that some time or otherâ€”in another year or two, perhapsâ€”it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place.
mrs. weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event.â€”she had been extremely surprized, never more so

nexceptionable a connexion, and in one respect, one point of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible, so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed as if emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature, and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished it long ago.â€”how very few of those men in a rank of life to address emma would have renounced their own home for hartfield! and who but mr. knightley could know and bear with mr. woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement desirable!â€”the difficulty of disposing of poor mr. woodhouse had been always felt in her husbandâ€™s plans and her own, for a marriage between frank and emma. how to settle the claims of enscombe and hartfield had been a continual impedimentâ€”less acknowledged by mr. weston than by herselfâ€”but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by sayingâ€”â€œthose matters will take care of themselves; the young people will find a way.â€ but he

m that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty.
in the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father; not always listening, but always agreeing to what he said; and, whether in speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to randalls every day, or poor mrs. weston would be disappointed.
they arrived.â€”mrs. weston was alone in the drawing-room:â€”but hardly had they been told of the baby, and mr. woodhouse received the thanks for coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse was caught through the blind, of two figures passing near the window.
â€œit is frank and miss fairfax,â€ said mrs. weston. â€œi was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning. he stays till to-morrow, and miss fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us.â€”they are coming in, i hope.â€
in half a minute they were in the room. emma was extremely glad to see himâ€”but there was a de

nd having all sat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle, that emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she had long felt, of seeing frank churchill once more, and of seeing him with jane, would yield its proportion of pleasure. when mr. weston joined the party, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer a want of subject or animationâ€”or of courage and opportunity for frank churchill to draw near her and say,
â€œi have to thank you, miss woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message in one of mrs. westonâ€™s letters. i hope time has not made you less willing to pardon. i hope you do not retract what you then said.â€
â€œno, indeed,â€ cried emma, most happy to begin, â€œnot in the least. i am particularly glad to see and shake hands with youâ€”and to give you joy in person.â€
he thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.

â€œit is not now worth a regret,â€ said emma.
â€œi have some hope,â€ resumed he, â€œof my uncleâ€™s being persuaded to pay a visit at randalls; he wants to be introduced to her. when the campbells are returned, we shall meet them in london, and continue there, i trust, till we may carry her northward.â€”but now, i am at such a distance from herâ€”is not it hard, miss woodhouse?â€”till this morning, we have not once met since the day of reconciliation. do not you pity me?â€
emma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gay thought, he cried,
â€œah! by the bye,â€ then sinking his voice, and looking demure for the momentâ€”â€œi hope mr. knightley is well?â€ he paused.â€”she coloured and laughed.â€”â€œi know you saw my letter, and think you may remember my wish in your favour. let me return your congratulations.â€”i assure you that i have heard t

en talking of the child, mrs. weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under, the evening before, from the infantâ€™s appearing not quite well. she believed she had been foolish, but it had alarmed her, and she had been within half a minute of sending for mr. perry. perhaps she ought to be ashamed, but mr. weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.â€”in ten minutes, however, the child had been perfectly well again. this was her history; and particularly interesting it was to mr. woodhouse, who commended her very much for thinking of sending for perry, and only regretted that she had not done it. â€œshe should always send for perry, if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment. she could not be too soon alarmed, nor send for perry too often. it was a pity, perhaps, that he had not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now, very well considering, it would probably have been better if perry had seen it.â€

tch miss fairfaxâ€™s eye. â€œmy friend mr. perry! what are they saying about mr. perry?â€”has he been here this morning?â€”and how does he travel now?â€”has he set up his carriage?â€
emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined in the laugh, it was evident from janeâ€™s countenance that she too was really hearing him, though trying to seem deaf.
â€œsuch an extraordinary dream of mine!â€ he cried. â€œi can never think of it without laughing.â€”she hears us, she hears us, miss woodhouse. i see it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown. look at her. do not you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her own letter, which sent me the report, is passing under her eyeâ€”that the whole blunder is spread before herâ€”that she can attend to nothing else, though pretending to listen to the others?â€

orts of her beloved home with the campbells.â€”the mr. churchills were also in town; and they were only waiting for november.
the intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, by emma and mr. knightley.â€”they had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while john and isabella were still at hartfield, to allow them the fortnightâ€™s absence in a tour to the seaside, which was the plan.â€”john and isabella, and every other friend, were agreed in approving it. but mr. woodhouseâ€”how was mr. woodhouse to be induced to consent?â€”he, who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event.
when first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they were almost hopeless.â€”a second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.â€”he began to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent itâ€”a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation. still, however, he was not happy. nay, he appeared so much otherwise, that his daughterâ€™s courage failed. she

could not bear to see him suffering, to know him fancying himself neglected; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the mr. knightleys, that when once the event were over, his distress would be soon over too, she hesitatedâ€”she could not proceed.
in this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden illumination of mr. woodhouseâ€™s mind, or any wonderful change of his nervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another way.â€”mrs. westonâ€™s poultry-house was robbed one night of all her turkeysâ€”evidently by the ingenuity of man. other poultry-yards in the neighbourhood also suffered.â€”pilfering was housebreaking to mr. woodhouseâ€™s fears.â€”he was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his son-in-lawâ€™s protection, would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life. the strength, resolutio

his fullest dependence. while either of them protected him and his, hartfield was safe.â€”but mr. john knightley must be in london again by the end of the first week in november.
the result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary, cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment, she was able to fix her wedding-dayâ€”and mr. elton was called on, within a month from the marriage of mr. and mrs. robert martin, to join the hands of mr. knightley and miss woodhouse.
the wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have no taste for finery or parade; and mrs. elton, from the particulars detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very inferior to her own.â€”â€œvery little white satin, very few lace veils; a most pitiful business!â€”selina would stare when she heard of it.â€â€”but, in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, the confidence, the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the cere
