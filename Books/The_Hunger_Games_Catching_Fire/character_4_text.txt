ppear at this moment, the odds of scaling a tree before they attacked are not in 
my favor. i should get up, move around, and work the stiffness from my limbs. but instead i 
sit, as motionless as the rock beneath me, while the dawn begins to lighten the woods. i can't 
fight the sun. i can only watch helplessly as it drags me into a day that i've been dreading for 
months. 

by  noon  they  will  all  be  at  my  new  house  in  the  victor's  village.  the  reporters,  the 
camera crews, even effie trinket, my old escort, will have made their way to district 12 from 
the capitol. i wonder if effie will still be wearing that silly pink wig, or if she'll be sporting 
some other unnatural color especially for the victory tour. there will be others waiting, too. 
a staff to cater to my every need on the long train trip. a prep team to beautify me for public 
appearances. my stylist and friend, cinna, who designed the gorgeous outfits that first made 
the audience take notice of me in the hunger games

 that they can interview you about. peeta, it turns out, actually has a talent, which is 
painting. he's been frosting those cakes and cookies for years in his family's bakery. but now 
that he's rich, he can afford to smear real paint on canvases. i don't have a talent, unless you 

count  hunting  illegally,  which  they  don't.  or  maybe  singing,  which  i  wouldn't  do  for  the 
capitol in a million years. my mother tried to interest me in a variety of suitable alternatives 
from a list effie trinket sent her. cooking, flower arranging, playing the flute. none of them 
took, although prim had a knack for all three. finally cinna stepped in and offered to help me 
develop  my  passion  for  designing  clothes,  which  really  required  development  since  it  was 
nonexistent. but i said yes because it meant getting to talk to cinna, and he promised he'd do 
all the work. 

now he's arranging things around my living room: clothing, fabrics, and sketchbooks with 
designs  he's  drawn.  i  pic

sweater woven from green and blue and gray strands of kitten-soft wool. laced leather boots 
that don't pinch my toes. 

“did i design my outfit?” i ask. 

“no, you aspire to design your outfit and be like me, your fashion hero,” says cinna. he 
hands  me  a  small  stack  of  cards.  “you'll  read  these  off  camera  while  they're  filming  the 
clothes. try to sound like you care.” 

just then, effie trinket arrives in a pumpkin orange wig to remind everyone, “we're on a 
schedule!” she kisses  me on both cheeks while waving  in the camera crew, then orders me 
into  position.  effie's  the  only  reason  we  got  anywhere  on  time  in  the  capitol,  so  i  try  to 
accommodate  her.  i  start  bobbing  around  like  a  puppet,  holding  up  outfits  and  saying 
meaningless  things  like  “don't  you  love  it?”  the  sound  team  records  me  reading  from  my 
cards in a chirpy voice s

johanna keeps watch while finnick, peeta, and i clean and lay out the seafood. peeta's just 
pried  open  an  oyster  when  i  hear  him  give  a  laugh.  “hey,  look  at  this!”  he  holds  up  a 
glistening, perfect pearl about the size of a pea.  “you know, if  you put enough pressure on 
coal it turns to pearls,” he says earnestly to finnick. 

“no,  it  doesn't,”  says  finnick  dismissively.  but  i  crack  up,  remembering  that's  how  a 
clueless effie trinket presented us to the people of the capitol last year, before anyone knew 
us. as coal pressured into pearls by our weighty existence. beauty that arose out of pain. 

peeta rinses the pearl off in the water and hands it to me. “for you.” i hold it out on my 
palm  and  examine  its  iridescent  surface  in  the  sunlight.  yes,  i  will  keep  it.  for  the  few 
remaining hours of my life i will keep it close. this last gift from peeta. the only one i can 
really accept. perhaps it will giv
