[CHARACTER] - 
                 a
vaccination worker at the central london hatchery and conditioning
centre. she is an object of desire for a number of major and minor
characters, including bernard marx and john. her behavior is sometimes
intriguingly unorthodox, which makes her attractive to the reader.
for example, she defies her culture's conventions by dating one
man exclusively for several months, she is attracted to bernard--the misfit--and
she develops a violent passion for john the savage. ultimately,
her values are those of a conventional world state citizen: her
primary means of relating to other people is through sex, and she
is unable to share bernard's disaffection or to comprehend john's
alternate system of values.
