   stretcheth as far as doth the mind of man;
     a sound magician is a mighty god:
     here, faustus, tire[21] thy brains to gain a deity.

          enter wagner.[22]

     wagner, commend me to my dearest friends,
     the german valdes and cornelius;
     request them earnestly to visit me.

     wagner. i will, sir.
          [exit.]

     faustus. their conference will be a greater help to me
     than all my labours, plod i ne'er so fast.

          enter good angel and evil angel.

     good angel. o, faustus, lay that damned book aside,
     and gaze not on it, lest it tempt thy soul,
     and heap god's heavy wrath upon thy head!
     read, read the scriptures:--that is blasphemy.

     evil angel. go forward, faustus, in that famous art
     wherein all nature's treasure[23] is contain'd:
     be thou on earth as jove[24] is in the sky,
     lord and commander of these elements.[25]

ir in god, and trust in belzebub:
     now go not backward; no, faustus, be resolute:
     why waver'st thou?  o, something soundeth in mine ears,
     "abjure this magic, turn to god again!"
     ay, and faustus will turn to god again.
     to god? he loves thee not;
     the god thou serv'st is thine own appetite,
     wherein is fix'd the love of belzebub:
     to him i'll build an altar and a church,
     and offer lukewarm blood of new-born babes.

          enter good angel and evil angel.

     good angel. sweet faustus, leave that execrable art.

     faustus. contrition, prayer, repentance--what of them?

     good angel. o, they are means to bring thee unto heaven!

     evil angel. rather illusions, fruits of lunacy,
     that make men foolish that do trust them most.

     good angel. sweet faustus, think of heaven and heavenly things.

     evil angel. no, faustus; think of honour and of[76] wealth.
          [exeunt angels.]

     faustus. of wealth!

 wicked mephistophilis,
     because thou hast depriv'd me of those joys.

     mephist. why, faustus,
     thinkest thou heaven is such a glorious thing?
     i tell thee, 'tis not half so fair as thou,
     or any man that breathes on earth.

     faustus. how prov'st thou that?

     mephist. 'twas made for man, therefore is man more excellent.

     faustus. if it were made for man, 'twas made for me:
     i will renounce this magic and repent.

          enter good angel and evil angel.

     good angel. faustus, repent; yet god will pity thee.

     evil angel. thou art a spirit; god cannot pity thee.

     faustus. who buzzeth in mine ears i am a spirit?
     be i a devil, yet god may pity me;
     ay, god will pity me, if i repent.

     evil angel. ay, but faustus never shall repent.
          [exeunt angels.]

     faustus. my heart's so harden'd, i cannot repent:
     scarce can i name salvation, faith, or heaven,
     but fearful echoes thunder in mine e

     faustus. villain, have i not bound thee to tell me any thing?

     mephist. ay, that is not against our kingdom; but this is.  think
     thou on hell, faustus, for thou art damned.

     faustus. think, faustus, upon god that made the world.

     mephist. remember this.
          [exit.]

     faustus. ay, go, accursed spirit, to ugly hell!
     'tis thou hast damn'd distressed faustus' soul.
     is't not too late?

          re-enter good angel and evil angel.

     evil angel. too late.

     good angel. never too late, if faustus can repent.

     evil angel. if thou repent, devils shall tear thee in pieces.

     good angel. repent, and they shall never raze thy skin.
