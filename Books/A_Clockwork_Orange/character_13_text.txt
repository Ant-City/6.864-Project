 and i thought: “well, alex boy, little 6655321 as was, you have copped it lucky and no mistake. you are really going to enjoy it here.”

after i had been given a nice chasha of real horrorshow coffee and some old gazettas and mags to look at while peeting it, this first veck in white came in, the one who had like signed for me, and he said: “aha, there you are,” a silly sort of a veshch to say but it didn’t sound silly, this veck being so like nice. “my name,” he said, “is dr. branom. i’m dr. brodsky’s assistant. with your permission, i’ll just give you the usual brief overall examination.” and he took the old stetho out of his right carman. “we must make sure you’re quite fit, mustn’t we? yes indeed, we must.” so while i lay there with my pyjama top off and he did this, that and the other, i said:

“what exactly is it, sir, that you’re going to do?”

“oh,” said dr. branom, his cold stetho going all down my back, “it’s quite simple, really.

 we just show you some films.”

“films?” i said. i could hardly believe my ookos, brothers, as you may well understand. “you mean,” i said, “it will be just like going to the pictures?”

“they’ll be special films,” said dr. branom. “very special films. you’ll be having the first session this afternoon. yes,” he said, getting up from bending over me, “you seem to be quite a fit young boy. a bit under-nourished perhaps. that will be the fault of the prison food. put your pyjama top back on. after every meal,” he said, sitting on the edge of the bed, “we shall be giving you a shot in the arm. that should help.” i felt really grateful to this very nice dr. branom. i said:

“vitamins, sir, will it be?”

rm, and then swishhhh in went the vitamin stuff. then she went out again, clack clack on her high-heeled nogas. then the white-coated veck who was like a male nurse came in with a wheelchair. i was a malenky bit surprised to viddy that. i said:

“what giveth then, brother? i can walk, surely, to wherever we have to itty to.” but he said:

“best i push you there.” and indeed, o my brothers, when i got off the bed i found myself a malenky bit weak. it was the under-nourishment like dr. branom had said, all that horrible prison pishcha. but the vitamins in the after-meal injection would put me right. no doubt at all about that, i thought.

where i was wheeled to, brothers, was like no sinny i had ever viddied before. true enough, one wall was all covered with silver screen, and direct opposite was a wall with square holes in for the projector to project through, and there were stereo speakers stuck all over the mesto. but against the right-hand one of the other walls was a

 door opening and you could tell some very important chelloveck was coming in by the way the white-coated under-vecks went all stiff. and then i viddied this dr. brodsky. he was a malenky veck, very fat, with all curly hair curling all over his gulliver, and on his spuddy nose he had very thick ochkies. i could just viddy that he had a real horrorshow suit on, absolutely the heighth of fashion, and he had a like very delicate and subtle von of operating-theatres coming from him. with him was dr. branom, all smiling like as though to give me confidence. “everything ready?” said dr. brodsky in a very breathy goloss. then i could slooshy voices saying right right right from like a distance, then nearer to, then there was a quiet like humming shoom as though things had been switched on. and then the lights went out and there was your humble narrator and friend sitting alone in the dark, all on his frightened oddy knocky, not able to move nor shut his glazzies nor anything. and then, o my brot

headache and the thirst were terrible, and they all seemed to be coming out of the screen. so i creeched:

“stop the film! please, please stop it! i can’t stand any more.” and then the goloss of this dr. brodsky said:

“stop it? stop it, did you say? why, we’ve hardly started.” and he and the others smecked quite loud.

i do not wish to describe, brothers, what other horrible veshches i was like forced to viddy that afternoon. the like minds of this dr. brodsky and dr. branom and the others in white coats, and remember there was this devotchka twiddling with the knobs and watching the meters, they must have been more cally and filthy than any prestoopnick in the staja itself. because i did not think it was possible for any veck to even think of making films of what i was forced to viddy, all tied to this chair and my glazzies made to be wide open. all i could do was to creech very gromky for them to turn it off, turn it off, and that like part drowned the noise of d

ratsing and fillying and also the music that went with it all. you can imagine it was like a terrible relief when i’d viddied the last bit of film, and this dr. brodsky said, in a very yawny and bored like goloss: “i think that should be enough for day one, don’t you, branom?” and there i was with the lights switched on, my gulliver throbbing like a bolshy big engine that makes pain, and my rot all dry and cally inside, and feeling i could like sick up every bit of pishcha i had ever eaten, o my brothers, since the day i was like weaned. “all right,” said this dr. brodsky, “he can be taken back to his bed.” then he like patted me on the pletcho and said: “good, good. a very promising start,” grinning all over his litso, then he like waddled out, dr. b

anyhow, they freed my plott from the chair and they let go the skin above my glazzies so that i could open and shut them again, and i shut them, o my brothers, with the pain and throb in my gulliver, and then i was like carried to the old wheel-chair and taken back to my malenky bedroom, the under-veck who wheeled me singing away at some hound-and-ho

rny popsong so that i like snarled: “shut it, thou,” but he only smecked and said: “never mind, friend,” and then sang louder. so i was put into the bed and still felt bolnoy but could not sleep, but soon i started to feel that soon i might start to feel that i might soon start feeling just a malenky bit better, and then i was brought some nice hot chai with plenty of moloko and sakar and, peeting that, i knew that that like horrible nightmare was in the past and all over. and then dr. branom came in, all nice and smiling. he said:

“well, by my calculations you should be starting to feel all right again. yes?”

“sir,” i said, like wary. i did not quite kopat what he was getting at govoreeting about calculations, seeing that getting better from feeling bolnoy is like your own affair and nothing to do with calculations. he sat down, all nice and droogy, on the bed’s edge and said:

“dr. brodsky is pleased with you. you had a very positive response. tomorrow, of cour

se, there’ll be two sessions, morning and afternoon, and i should imagine that you’ll be feeling a bit limp at the end of the day. but we have to be hard on you, you have to be cured.” i said:

“you mean i have to sit through—? you mean i have to look at—? oh, no,” i said. “it was horrible.”

“of course it was horrible,” smiled dr. branom. “violence is a very horrible thing. that’s what you’re learning now. your body is learning it.”

“but,” i said, “i don’t understand. i don’t understand about feeling sick like i did. i never used to feel sick before. i used to feel like very the opposite. i mean, doing it or watching it i used to feel real horrorshow. i just don’t understand why or how or what—”

“life is a very wonderful thing,” said dr. branom in a like very holy goloss. “the processes of li

 sound-track, and it was ludwig van, the last movement of the fifth symphony, and i creeched like bezoomny at that. “stop!” i creeched. “stop, you grahzny disgusting sods. it’s a sin, that’s what it is, a filthy unforgivable sin, you bratchnies!” they didn’t stop right away, because there was only a minute or two more to go—lewdies being beaten up and all krovvy, then more firing squads, then the old nazi flag and the end. but when the lights came on this dr. brodsky and also dr. branom were standing in front of me, and dr. brodsky said:

“what’s all this about sin, eh?”

“that,” i said, very sick. “using ludwig van like that. he did no harm to anyone. beethoven just wrote music.” and then i was really sick and they had to bring a bowl that was in the shape of like a kidney.

“music,” said dr. brodsky, like musing. “so you’re keen on music. i know nothing about it myself. it’s a useful emotional heightener, that’s all i know. well, well. what do

 you think about that, eh, branom?”

“it can’t be helped,” said dr. branom. “each man kills the thing he loves, as the poet-prisoner said. here’s the punishment element, perhaps. the governor ought to be pleased.”

“give me a drink,” i said, “for bog’s sake.”

“loosen him,” ordered dr. brodsky. “fetch him a carafe of ice-cold water.” so then these under-vecks got to work and soon i was peeting gallons and gallons of water and it was like heaven, o my brothers. dr. brodsky said:

“you seem a sufficiently intelligent young man. you seem,

 it’s not really the films that’s doing it. but i feel that if you’ll stop these films i’ll stop feeling ill.”

“right,” said dr. brodsky. “it’s association, the oldest educational method in the world. and what really causes you to feel ill?”

“these grahzny sodding veshches that come out of my gulliver and my plott,” i said, “that’s what it is.”

“quaint,” said dr. brodsky, like smiling, “the dialect of the tribe. do you know anything of its provenance, branom?”

“odd bits of old rhyming slang,” said dr. branom, who did not look quite so much like a friend any more. “a bit of gipsy talk, too. but most of the roots are slav. propaganda. subliminal penetration.”

“all right, all right, all right,” said dr. brodsky, like impatient and not interested any more. “well,” he said to me, “it isn’t the wires. it’s nothing to do with what’s fastened to you. those are just for measuring your reactions. what is it, then?”

rful about it. it will soon be all over. in less than a fortnight now you’ll be a free man.” then he patted me on the pletcho.

less than a fortnight, o my brothers and friends, it was like an age. it was like from the beginning of the world to the end of it. to finish the fourteen years without remission in the staja would have been nothing to it. every day it was the same. when the devotchka with the hypodermic came round, though, four days after this govoreeting with dr. brodsky and dr. branom, i said: “oh, no you won’t,” and tolchocked her on the rooker, and the syringe went tinkle clatter on to the floor. that was like to viddy what they would do. what they did was to get four or five real bolshy white-coated bastards of under-vecks to hold me down on the bed, tolchocking me with grinny litsos close to mine, and then this nurse ptitsa said: “you wicked naughty little devil, you,” while she jabbed my rooker with another syringe and squirted this stuff in real brutal and na

“aha. at this stage, gentlemen, we introduce the subject himself. he is, as you will percieve, fit and well nourished. he comes straight from a night’s sleep and a good breakfast, undru

perhaps, i thought, if i ittied off to the public biblio around the corner i might find some book on the best way of snuffing it with no pain. i thought of myself dead and how sorry everybody was going to be, pee and em and that cally vonny joe who was a like usurper, and also dr. brodsky and dr. branom and that inferior interior minister and every veck else. and the boastful vonny government too. so out i scatted into the winter, and it was afternoon now, near two o’clock, as i could viddy from the bolshy center timepiece, so that me being in the land with the old moloko plus must have took like longer than i thought. i walked down marghanita boulevard and then turned into boothby avenue, then round the corner again, and there was the public biblio.
