Achilles - 
                    The
son of the military man Peleus and the sea-nymph Thetis. The most
powerful warrior in The Iliad, Achilles commands
the Myrmidons, soldiers from his homeland of Phthia in Greece. Proud
and headstrong, he takes offense easily and reacts with blistering
indignation when he perceives that his honor has been slighted. Achilles'
wrath at Agamemnon for taking his war prize, the maiden Briseis,
forms the main subject of The Iliad.
