 pontellier wore eye-glasses. he was a man of forty, of medium height
and rather slender build; he stooped a little. his hair was brown and
straight, parted on one side. his beard was neatly and closely trimmed.

once in a while he withdrew his glance from the newspaper and looked
about him. there was more noise than ever over at the house. the main
building was called “the house,” to distinguish it from the cottages.
the chattering and whistling birds were still at it. two young girls,
the farival twins, were playing a duet from “zampa” upon the piano.
madame lebrun was bustling in and out, giving orders in a high key to a
yard-boy whenever she got inside the house, and directions in an equally
high voice to a dining-room servant whenever she got outside. she was
a fresh, pretty woman, clad always in white with elbow sleeves. her
starched skirts crinkled as she came and went. farther down, before
one of the cottages, a lady in black was walking demurely up and down,
telling her beads. a go

light and languor of the summer day.

mrs. pontellier reached over for a palm-leaf fan that lay on the porch
and began to fan herself, while robert sent between his lips light puffs
from his cigarette. they chatted incessantly: about the things around
them; their amusing adventure out in the water--it had again assumed its
entertaining aspect; about the wind, the trees, the people who had gone
to the cheniere; about the children playing croquet under the oaks, and
the farival twins, who were now performing the overture to “the poet and
the peasant.”

robert talked a good deal about himself. he was very young, and did not
know any better. mrs. pontellier talked a little about herself for the
same reason. each was interested in what the other said. robert spoke of
his intention to go to mexico in the autumn, where fortune awaited him.
he was always intending to go to mexico, but some way never got there.
meanwhile he held on to his modest position in a mercantile house

looking at the colored sheets of the comic papers which mr. pontellier
had brought down. the little pontellier boys were permitting them to do
so, and making their authority felt.

music, dancing, and a recitation or two were the entertainments
furnished, or rather, offered. but there was nothing systematic about
the programme, no appearance of prearrangement nor even premeditation.

at an early hour in the evening the farival twins were prevailed upon to
play the piano. they were girls of fourteen, always clad in the virgin’s
colors, blue and white, having been dedicated to the blessed virgin
at their baptism. they played a duet from “zampa,” and at the earnest
solicitation of every one present followed it with the overture to “the
poet and the peasant.”

the only being present who possessed sufficient candor to admit that he

music. she hoped that edna would go to see her in the city, and wrote
her address with the stub of a pencil on a piece of card which she found
in her pocket.

“when do you leave?” asked edna.

“next monday; and you?”

“the following week,” answered edna, adding, “it has been a pleasant
summer, hasn’t it, mademoiselle?”

“well,” agreed mademoiselle reisz, with a shrug, “rather pleasant, if it

the pontelliers possessed a very charming home on esplanade street in
new orleans. it was a large, double cottage, with a broad front veranda,
whose round, fluted columns supported the sloping roof. the house was
painted a dazzling white; the outside shutters, or jalousies, were
green. in the yard, which was kept scrupulously neat, were flowers and
plants of every description which flourishes in south louisiana. within
doors the appointments were perfect after the conventional ty
