bar he travelled the twenty feet of green carpet with his eyes fixed straight ahead by old habit; and then, with his foot firmly on the rail, he turned and surveyed the room, encountering only a single pair of eyes that fluttered up from a newspaper in the corner. charlie asked for the head barman, paul, who in the latter days of the bull market had come to work in his own custom-built car--disembarking, however, with due nicety at the nearest corner. but paul was at his country house today and alix giving him information.

"no, no more," charlie said, "i'm going slow these days."

alix congratulated him: "you were going pretty strong a couple of years ago."

"i'll stick to it all right," charlie assured him. "i've stuck to it for over a year and a half now."

"how do you find conditions in america?"

"i haven't been to america for months. i'm in business in prague, representing a couple of concerns there. they don't know about me down there."

alix smiled.

"remember the night of george h

ardt's bachelor dinner here?" said charlie. "by the way, what's become of claude fessenden?"

alix lowered his voice confidentially: "he's in paris, but he doesn't come here any more. paul doesn't allow it. he ran up a bill of thirty thousand francs, charging all his drinks and his lunches, and usually his dinner, for more than a year. and when paul finally told him he had to pay, he gave him a bad check."

alix shook his head sadly.

"i don't understand it, such a dandy fellow. now he's all bloated up--" he made a plump apple of his hands.

charlie watched a group of strident queens installing themselves in a corner.

"nothing affects them," he thought. "stocks rise and fall, people loaf or work, but they go on forever." the place oppressed him. he called for the dice and shook with alix for the drink.

"here for long, mr. wales?"

"i'm here for four or five days to see my little girl."

"oh-h! you ha

spect it was a nightmare. locking out helen didn't fit in with any other act of his life, but the tricycle incident did--it was one of many. how many weeks or months of dissipation to arrive at that condition of utter irresponsibility?

he tried to picture how lorraine had appeared to him then--very attractive; helen was unhappy about it, though she said nothing. yesterday, in the restaurant, lorraine had seemed trite, blurred, worn away. he emphatically did not want to see her, and he was glad alix had not given away his hotel address. it was a relief to think, instead, of honoria, to think of sundays spent with her and of saying good morning to her and of knowing she was there in his house at night, drawing her breath in the darkness.

at five he took a taxi and bought presents for all the peters--a piquant cloth doll, a box of roman soldiers, flowers for marion, big linen handkerchiefs for lincoln.

he saw, when he arrived in the apartment, that marion had accepted the inevitable. she g

lled the peters' apartment; lincoln answered.

"i called up because this thing is on my mind. has marion said anything definite?"

"marion's sick," lincoln answered shortly. "i know this thing isn't altogether your fault, but i can't have her go to pieces about it. i'm afraid we'll have to let it slide for six months; i can't take the chance of working her up to this state again."

"i see."

"i'm sorry, charlie."

he went back to his table. his whisky glass was empty, but he shook his head when alix looked at it questioningly. there wasn't much he could do now except send honoria some things; he would send her a lot of things tomorrow. he thought rather angrily that this was just money--he had given so many people money. . . .

"no, no more," he said to another waiter. "what do i owe you?"

he would come back some day; they couldn't make him pay forever. but he wanted his child, and nothing was much good now, beside that fact. he wasn't young any more, with a lot of nice thoughts and dream
