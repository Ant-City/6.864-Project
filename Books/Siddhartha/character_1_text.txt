t how to handle the boat."

for a long time, the ferryman looked at the stranger, searching.

"now i recognise you," he finally said.  "at one time, you've slept in
my hut, this was a long time ago, possibly more than twenty years ago,
and you've been ferried across the river by me, and we parted like good
friends.  haven't you've been a samana?  i can't think of your name any
more."

"my name is siddhartha, and i was a samana, when you've last seen me."

"so be welcome, siddhartha.  my name is vasudeva.  you will, so i hope,
be my guest today as well and sleep in my hut, and tell me, where you're
coming from and why these beautiful clothes are such a nuisance to you."

they had reached the middle of the river, and vasudeva pushed the oar
with more strength, in order to overcome the current.  he worked calmly,
his eyes fixed in on the front of the boat, with brawny arms.
siddhartha sat and watched him, and remembered, how once before, on that
last day of his time as a samana, love for this man

 had stirred in his
heart.  gratefully, he accepted vasudeva's invitation.  when they had
reached the bank, he helped him to tie the boat to the stakes; after
this, the ferryman asked him to enter the hut, offered him bread and
water, and siddhartha ate with eager pleasure, and also ate with eager
pleasure of the mango fruits, vasudeva offered him.

afterwards, it was almost the time of the sunset, they sat on a log by
the bank, and siddhartha told the ferryman about where he originally
came from and about his life, as he had seen it before his eyes today,
in that hour of despair.  until late at night, lasted his tale.

vasudeva listened with great attention.  listening carefully, he let
everything enter his mind, birthplace and childhood, all that learning,
all that searching, all joy, all distress.  this was among the

man's virtues one of the greatest:  like only a few, he knew how
to listen.  without him having spoken a word, the speaker sensed how
vasudeva let his words enter his mind, quiet, open, waiting, how he
did not lose a single one, awaited not a single one with impatience,
did not add his praise or rebuke, was just listening.  siddhartha felt,
what a happy fortune it is, to confess to such a listener, to bury in
his heart his own life, his own search, his own suffering.

but in the end of siddhartha's tale, when he spoke of the tree by the
river, and of his deep fall, of the holy om, and how he had felt such
a love for the river after hi

s slumber, the ferryman listened with twice
the attention, entirely and completely absorbed by it, with his eyes
closed.

but when siddhartha fell silent, and a long silence had occurred, then
vasudeva said:  "it is as i thought.  the river has spoken to you.  it
is your friend as well, it speaks to you as well.  that is good, that is
very good.  stay with me, siddhartha, my friend.  i used to have a wife,
her bed was next to mine, but she has died a long time ago, for a long
time, i have lived alone.  now, you shall live with me, there is space
and food for both."

"i thank you," said siddhartha, "i thank you and accept.  and i also
thank you for this, vasudeva, for listening to me so well!

 these people
are rare who know how to listen.  and i did not meet a single one who
knew it as well as you did.  i will also learn in this respect from
you."

"you will learn it," spoke vasudeva, "but not from me.  the river has
taught me to listen, from it you will learn it as well.  it knows
everything, the river, everything can be learned from it.  see, you've
already learned this from the water too, that it is good to strive
downwards, to sink, to seek depth.  the rich and elegant siddhartha is
becoming an oarsman's servant, the learned brahman siddhartha becomes a
ferryman: this has also been told to you by the river.  you'll learn
that other thing from it as well."

quoth siddhar

tha after a long pause:  "what other thing, vasudeva?"

vasudeva rose.  "it is late," he said, "let's go to sleep.  i can't
tell you that other thing, oh friend.  you'll learn it, or perhaps you
know it already.  see, i'm no learned man, i have no special skill in
speaking, i also have no special skill in thinking.  all i'm able to do
is to listen and to be godly, i have learned nothing else.  if i was
able to say and teach it, i might be a wise man, but like this i am only
a ferryman, and it is my task to ferry people across the river.  i have

rimages, and the river was
obstructing their path, and the ferryman's job was to get them quickly
across that obstacle.  but for some among thousands, a few, four or
five, the river has stopped being an obstacle, they have heard its
voice, they have listened to it, and the river has become sacred to
them, as it has become sacred to me.  let's rest now, siddhartha."

siddhartha stayed with the ferryman and learned to operate the boat, and
when there was nothing to do at the ferry, he worked with vasudeva in
the rice-field, gathered wood, plucked the fruit off the banana-trees.
he learned to build an oar, and learned to mend the boat, and to weave
baskets, and was joyful because of everything he learned, and the days
and months passed quickly.  but more than vasudeva could teach him, he
was taught by the river.  incessantly, he learned from it.  most of all,
he learned from it to listen, to pay close attention with a quiet heart,
with a waiting, opened soul, without passion, without a wish, with

judgement, without an opinion.

in a friendly manner, he lived side by side with vasudeva, and
occasionally they exchanged some words, few and at length thought about
words.  vasudeva was no friend of words; rarely, siddhartha succeeded
in persuading him to speak.

"did you," so he asked him at one time, "did you too learn that secret
from the river: that there is no time?"

vasudeva's face was filled with a bright smile.

"yes, siddhartha," he spoke.  "it is this what you mean, isn't it: that
the river is everywhere at once, at the source and at the mouth, at the
waterfall, at the ferry, at the rapids, in the sea, in the mountains,
everywhere at once, and that there is only the present time for it, not
the shadow of the past, not the shadow of the future?"

"this it is," said siddhartha.  "and when i had learned it, i looked at
my life, and it was also a river, and the boy
 
 ___________________________
 
 was no future.  nothing
was, nothing will be; everything is, everything has existence and is
present."

siddhartha spoke with ecstasy; deeply, this enlightenment had delighted
him.  oh, was not all suffering time, were not all forms of tormenting
oneself and being afraid time, was not everything hard, everything
hostile in the world gone and overcome as soon as one had overcome time,
as soon as time would have been put out of existence by one's thoughts?
in ecstatic delight, he had spoken, but vasudeva smiled at him brightly
and nodded in confirmation; silently he nodded, brushed his hand over
siddhartha's shoulder, turned back to his work.

and once again, when the river had just increased its flow in the rainy
season and made a powerful noise, then said siddhartha:  "isn't it so,
oh friend, the river has many voices, very many voices?  hasn't it the
voice of a king, and of a warrior, and of a bull, and of a bird of the
night, and of a woman giving birth, and of a sighing man, and a thousand

other voices more?"

"so it is," vasudeva nodded, "all voices of the creatures are in its
voice."

"and do you know," siddhartha continued, "what word it speaks, when you
succeed in hearing all of its ten thousand voices at once?"

happily, vasudeva's face was smiling, he bent over to siddhartha and
spoke the holy om into his ear.  and this had been the very thing which
siddhartha had also been hearing.

and time after time, his smile became more similar to the ferryman's,
became almost just as bright, almost just as throughly glowing with
bliss, just as shining out of thousand small wrinkles, just as alike to
a child's, just as alike to an old man's.  many travellers, seeing the
two ferrymen, thought they were brothers.  often, they sat i

, desired to go back home, desired to
rest, desired to eat, became disobedient and started whining.

kamala often had to take a rest with him, he was accustomed to having
his way against her, she had to feed him, had to comfort him, had to
scold him.  he did not comprehend why he had to go on this exhausting
and sad pilgrimage with his mother, to an unknown place, to a stranger,
who was holy and about to die.  so what if he died, how did this concern
the boy?

the pilgrims were getting close to vasudeva's ferry, when little
siddhartha once again forced his mother to rest.  she, kamala herself,
had also become tired, and while the boy was chewing a banana, she
crouched down on the ground, closed her eyes a bit, and rested.  but
suddenly, she uttered a wailing scream, the boy looked at her in fear
and saw her face having grown pale from horror; and from under her
dress, a small, black snake fled, by which kamala had been bitten.

hurriedly, they now both ran along the path, in order to reach peo

and got near to the ferry, there kamala collapsed, and was not able to
go any further.  but the boy started crying miserably, only interrupting
it to kiss and hug his mother, and she also joined his loud screams for
help, until the sound reached vasudeva's ears, who stood at the ferry.
quickly, he came walking, took the woman on his arms, carried her into
the boat, the boy ran along, and soon they all reached the hut, were
siddhartha stood by the stove and was just lighting the fire.  he looked
up and first saw the boy's face, which wondrously reminded him of
something, like a warning to remember something he had forgotten.  then
he saw kamala, whom he instantly recognised, though she lay unconscious
in the ferryman's arms, and now he knew that

 became confused and fell shut.  the boy wept, siddhartha took
him on his knees, let him weep, petted his hair, and at the sight of
the child's face, a brahman prayer came to his mind, which he had
learned a long time ago, when he had been a little boy himself.  slowly,
with a singing voice, he started to speak; from his past and childhood,
the words came flowing to him.  and with that singsong, the boy became
calm, was only now and then uttering a sob and fell asleep.  siddhartha
placed him on vasudeva's bed.  vasudeva stood by the stove and cooked
rice.  siddhartha gave him a look, which he returned with a smile.

"she'll die," siddhartha said quietly.

vasudeva nodded; over his friendly face ran the light of the stove's
fire.

once again, kamala returned to consciousness.  pain distorted her face,
siddhartha's eyes read the suffering on her mouth, on her pale cheeks.
quietly, he read it, attentively, waiting, his mind becoming one with
her suffering.  kamala felt it, her gaze sought his eye

 tired wrinkles, filled
himself with this sight, saw his own face lying in the same manner,
just as white, just as quenched out, and saw at the same time his face
and hers being young, with red lips, with fiery eyes, and the feeling of
this both being present and at the same time real, the feeling of
eternity, completely filled every aspect of his being.  deeply he felt,
more deeply than ever before, in this hour, the indestructibility of
every life, the eternity of every moment.

when he rose, vasudeva had prepared rice for him.  but siddhartha did
not eat.  in the stable, where their goat stood, the two old men
prepared beds of straw for themselves, and vasudeva lay himself down
to sleep.  but siddhartha went outside and sat this night before the
hut, listening to the river, surrounded by the past, touched and
encircled by all times of his life at the same time.  but occasionally,
he rose, stepped to the door of the hut and listened, whether the boy
was sleeping.

early in the morning, even

before the sun could be seen, vasudeva came
out of the stable and walked over to his friend.

"you haven't slept," he said.

"no, vasudeva.  i sat here, i was listening to the river.  a lot it has
told me, deeply it has filled me with the healing thought, with the
thought of oneness."

"you've experienced suffering, siddhartha, but i see: no sadness has
entered your heart."

"no, my dear, how should i be sad?  i, who have been rich and happy,
have become even richer and happier now.  my son has been given to me."

"your son shall be welcome to me as well.  but now, siddhartha, let's
get to work, there is much to be done.  kamala h

on which my wife had died a long time ago.  let us also build kamala's

while the boy was still asleep, they built the funeral pile.




the son

timid and weeping, the boy had attended his mother's funeral; gloomy
and shy, he had listened to siddhartha, who greeted him as his son and
welcomed him at his place in vasudeva's hut.  pale, he sat for many
days by the hill of the dead, did not want to eat, gave no open look,
did not open his heart, met his fate with resistance and denial.

siddhartha spared him and let him do as he pleased, he honoured his
mourning.  siddhartha understood that his son did not know him, that
he could not love him like a father.  slowly, he also saw and understood
that the eleven-year-old was a pampered boy, a mother's boy, and that he
had grown up in the habits of rich people, accusto

 strangers and in poverty.  he did
not force him, he did many a chore for him, always picked the best piece
of the meal for him.  slowly, he hoped to win him over, by friendly
patience.

rich and happy, he had called himself, when the boy had come to him.
since time had passed on in the meantime, and the boy remained a
stranger and in a gloomy disposition, since he displayed a proud and
stubbornly disobedient heart, did not want to do any work, did not pay
his respect to the old men, stole from vasudeva's fruit-trees, then
siddhartha began to understand that his son had not brought him
happiness and peace, but suffering and worry.  but he loved him, and he
preferred the suffering and worries of love over happiness and joy
without the boy.  since young siddhartha was in the hut, the old men had
split the work.  vasudeva had again taken on the job of the ferryman all
by himself, and siddhartha, in order to be with his son, did the work in
the hut and the field.

for a long time, for long months,
 
 ___________________________
 
 siddhartha waited for his son to
understand him, to accept his love, to perhaps reciprocate it.  for
long months, vasudeva waited, watching, waited and said nothing.  one
day, when siddhartha the younger had once again tormented his father
very much with spite and an unsteadiness in his wishes and had broken
both of his rice-bowls, vasudeva took in the evening his friend aside
and talked to him.

"pardon me." he said, "from a friendly heart, i'm talking to you.  i'm
seeing that you are tormenting yourself, i'm seeing that you're in grief.
your son, my dear, is worrying you, and he is also worrying me.  that
young bird is accustomed to a different life, to a different nest.  he
has not, like you, ran away from riches and the city, being disgusted
and fed up with it; against his will, he had to leave all this behind.
i asked the riv

should ask the river; you too should listen to it!"

troubled, siddhartha looked into his friendly face, in the many wrinkles
of which there was incessant cheerfulness.

"how could i part with him?" he said quietly, ashamed.  "give me some
more time, my dear!  see, i'm fighting for him, i'm seeking to win his
heart, with love and with friendly patience i intent to capture it.
one day, the river shall also talk to him, he also is called upon."

vasudeva's smile flourished more warmly.  "oh yes, he too is called
upon, he too is of the eternal life.  but do we, you and me, know what
he is called upon to do, what path to take, what actions to perform,
what pain to endure?  not a small one, his pain will be; after all, his
heart is proud and hard, people like this have to suffer a lot, err a
lot, do much injustice, burden themselves with much sin.  tell me, my
dear: you're not taking control of your son's upbringing?  you don't
force him?  you don

't beat him?  you don't punish him?"

"no, vasudeva, i don't do anything of this."

"i knew it.  you don't force him, don't beat him, don't give him orders,
because you know that 'soft' is stronger than 'hard', water stronger
than rocks, love stronger than force.  very good, i praise you.  but
aren't you mistaken in thinking that you wouldn't force him, wouldn't
punish him?  don't you shackle him with your love?  don't you make him
feel inferior every day, and don't you make it even harder on him with
your kindness and patience?  don't you force

 him, the arrogant and
pampered boy, to live in a hut with two old banana-eaters, to whom even
rice is a delicacy, whose thoughts can't be his, whose hearts are old
and quiet and beats in a different pace than his?  isn't forced, isn't
he punished by all this?"

troubled, siddhartha looked to the ground.  quietly, he asked:  "what
do you think should i do?"

quoth vasudeva:  "bring him into the city, bring him into his mother's
house, there'll still be servants around, give him to them.  and when
there aren't any around any more, bring him to a teacher, not for the
teachings' sake, but so that he shall be among other boys, and among
girls, and in the world which is his own.  have you never thought of
this?"

"you're seeing into my heart," siddhartha spoke sadly.  "often, i have
thought of this.  but look, how shall i put him, who had no tender heart
anyhow, into

elf with life, from
burdening himself with guilt, from drinking the bitter drink for
himself, from finding his path for himself?  would you think, my dear,
anybody might perhaps be spared from taking this path?  that perhaps
your little son would be spared, because you love him, because you would
like to keep him from suffering and pain and disappointment?  but even
if you would die ten times for him, you would not be able to take the
slightest part of his destiny upon yourself."

never before, vasudeva had spoken so many words.  kindly, siddhartha
thanked him, went troubled into the hut, could not sleep for a long
time.  vasudeva had told him nothing, he had not already thought and
known for himself.  but this was a knowledge he could not act upon,
stronger than the knowledge was his love for the boy, stronger was his
tenderness, his fear to lose him.  had he ever lost his heart so much
to something, had he ever loved any person thus, thus blindly, thus
sufferingly, thus unsuccessfully, and y

et thus happily?

siddhartha could not heed his friend's advice, he could not give up the
boy.  he let the boy give him orders, he let him disregard him.  he
said nothing and waited; daily, he began the mute struggle of
friendliness, the silent war of patience.  vasudeva also said nothing
and waited, friendly, knowing, patient.  they were both masters of
patience.

at one time, when the boy's face reminded him very much of kamala,
siddhartha suddenly had to think of a line which kamala a long time
ago, in the days of their youth, had once said to him.  "you cannot
love," she had said to him, and he had agreed with her and had compared
himself with a star, while comparing the childlike people with falling
leaves, and nevertheless he had also sensed an accusation

disappeared.  what had also disappeared was
a small basket, woven out of bast of two colours, in which the ferrymen
kept those copper and silver coins which they received as a fare.
the boat had also disappeared, siddhartha saw it lying by the opposite
bank.  the boy had ran away.

"i must follow him," said siddhartha, who had been shivering with grief
since those ranting speeches, the boy had made yesterday.  "a child
can't go through the forest all alone.  he'll perish.  we must build a
raft, vasudeva, to get over the water."

"we will build a raft," said vasudeva, "to get our boat back, which the
boy has taken away.  but him, you shall let run along, my friend, he is
no child any more, he knows how to get around.  he's looking for the
path to the city, and he is right, don't forget that.  he's doing what
you've failed to do yourself.  he's taking care of himself, he's taking
his course.  alas, siddhartha, i see you suffering, but you're suffering
a pain at which one would like to laugh, at 
 
 ___________________________
 
which you'll soon laugh for
yourself."

siddhartha did not answer.  he already held the axe in his hands and
began to make a raft of bamboo, and vasudeva helped him to tied the
canes together with ropes of grass.  then they crossed over, drifted
far off their course, pulled the raft upriver on the opposite bank.

"why did you take the axe along?" asked siddhartha.

vasudeva said:  "it might have been possible that the oar of our boat
got lost."

but siddhartha knew what his friend was thinking.  he thought, the boy
would have thrown away or broken the oar in order to get even and in
order to keep them from following him.  and in fact, there was no oar
left in the boat.  vasudeva pointed to the bottom of the boat and looked
at his friend with a smile, as if he wanted to say:  "don't you see what
your son is trying to tell you?  don't you see that he doesn't want to
 
 ___________________________
 

be followed?"  but he did not say this in words.  he started making a
new oar.  but siddhartha bid his farewell, to look for the run-away.
vasudeva did not stop him.

when siddhartha had already been walking through the forest for a long
time, the thought occurred to him that his search was useless.  either,
so he thought, the boy was far ahead and had already reached the city,
or, if he should still be on his way, he would conceal himself from him,
the pursuer.  as he continued thinking, he also found that he, on his
part, was not worried for his son, that he knew deep inside that he had
neither perished nor was in any danger in the fores

the monks in the garden saw him, and since he crouched for many hours,
and dust was gathering on his gray hair, one of them came to him and
placed two bananas in front of him.  the old man did not see him.

from this petrified state, he was awoken by a hand touching his
shoulder.  instantly, he recognised this touch, this tender, bashful
touch, and regained his senses.  he rose and greeted vasudeva, who had
followed him.  and when he looked into vasudeva's friendly face, into
the small wrinkles, which were as if they were filled with nothing but
his smile, into the happy eyes, then he smiled too.  now he saw the
bananas lying in front of him, picked them up, gave one to the ferryman,
ate the other one himself.  after this, he silently went back into the
forest with vasudeva, returned home to the ferry.  neither one talked
about what had happened today, neither one mentioned the boy's name

,
neither one spoke about him running away, neither one spoke about the
wound.  in the hut, siddhartha lay down on his bed, and when after a
while vasudeva came to him, to offer him a bowl of coconut-milk, he
already found him asleep.




om

for a long time, the wound continued to burn.  many a traveller
siddhartha had to ferry across the river who was accompanied by a son or
a daughter, and he saw none of them without envying him, without
thinking:  "so many, so many thousands possess this sweetest of good
fortunes--why don't i?  even bad people, even thieves and robbers have
children and love them, and are being loved by them, all except for me

l, in some moments, seem to be superior to humans in their
tough, unrelenting performance of what is necessary.

slowly blossomed, slowly ripened in siddhartha the realisation, the
knowledge, what wisdom actually was, what the goal of his long search
was.  it was nothing but a readiness of the soul, an ability, a secret
art, to think every moment, while living his life, the thought of
oneness, to be able to feel and inhale the oneness.  slowly this
blossomed in him, was shining back at him from vasudeva's old, childlike
face: harmony, knowledge of the eternal perfection of the world,
smiling, oneness.

but the wound still burned, longingly and bitterly siddhartha thought of
his son, nurtured his love and tenderness in his heart, allowed the
pain to gnaw at him, committed all foolish acts of love.  not by itself,
this flame would go out.

and one day, when the wound burned violently, siddhartha ferried across
the river, driven by a yearning, got off the boat and was willing to go
to the city an

 the boat and ferried back
to the hut, thinking of his father, thinking of his son, laughed at by
the river, at odds with himself, tending towards despair, and not less
tending towards laughing along at (?? über) himself and the entire
world.

alas, the wound was not blossoming yet, his heart was still fighting his
fate, cheerfulness and victory were not yet shining from his suffering.
nevertheless, he felt hope, and once he had returned to the hut, he felt
an undefeatable desire to open up to vasudeva, to show him everything,
the master of listening, to say everything.

vasudeva was sitting in the hut and weaving a basket.  he no longer used
the ferry-boat, his eyes were starting to get weak, and not just his
eyes; his arms and hands as well.  unchanged and flourishing was only
the joy and the cheerful benevolence of his face.

siddhartha sat down next to the old man, slowly he started talking.
what they had never talked about, he now told him of, of his walk to
the city, at that time, of th
 
 ___________________________
 
 of his envy at the sight
of happy fathers, of his knowledge of the foolishness of such wishes, of
his futile fight against them.  he reported everything, he was able to
say everything, even the most embarrassing parts, everything could be
said, everything shown, everything he could tell.  he presented his
wound, also told how he fled today, how he ferried across the water,
a childish run-away, willing to walk to the city, how the river had
laughed.

while he spoke, spoke for a long time, while vasudeva was listening
with a quiet face, vasudeva's listening gave siddhartha a stronger
sensation than ever before, he sensed how his pain, his fears flowed
over to him, how his secret hope flowed over, came back at him from
his counterpart.  to show his wound to this listener was the same as
bathing it in the river, until it had cooled and become one with the
river.  while he was still speaking, still admitting and confessing,
siddhartha felt more and more that this was no longer vasudeva, no
longer

a human being, who was listening to him, that this motionless
listener was absorbing his confession into himself like a tree the rain,
that this motionless man was the river itself, that he was god himself,
that he was the eternal itself.  and while siddhartha stopped thinking
of himself and his wound, this realisation of vasudeva's changed
character took possession of him, and the more he felt it and entered
into it, the less wondrous it became, the more he realised that
everything was in order and natural, that vasudeva had already been like
this for a long time, almost forever, that only he had not quite
recognised it, yes, that he himself had almost reached the same state.
he felt, that he was now seeing old vasudeva as the people see the
gods, and that this could not last; in his heart, he started bidding his
farewe

ll to vasudeva.  thorough all this, he talked incessantly.

when he had finished talking, vasudeva turned his friendly eyes, which
had grown slightly weak, at him, said nothing, let his silent love and
cheerfulness, understanding and knowledge, shine at him.  he took
siddhartha's hand, led him to the seat by the bank, sat down with him,
smiled at the river.

"you've heard it laugh," he said.  "but you haven't heard everything.
let's listen, you'll hear more."

they listened.  softly sounded the river, singing in many voices.
siddhartha looked into the water, and images appeared to him in the
 
 ___________________________
 

moving water: his father appeared, lonely, mourning for his son; he
himself appeared, lonely, he also being tied with the bondage of
yearning to his distant son; his son appeared, lonely as well, the boy,
greedily rushing along the burning course of his young wishes, each
one heading for his goal, each one obsessed by the goal, each one
suffering.  the river sang with a voice of suffering, longingly it sang,
longingly, it flowed towards its goal, lamentingly its voice sang.

"do you hear?" vasudeva's mute gaze asked.  siddhartha nodded.

"listen better!" vasudeva whispered.

siddhartha made an effort to listen better.  the image of his father,
his own image, the image of his son merged, kamala's image also appeared
and was dispersed, and the image of govinda, and other images, and they
merged with each other, turned all into the river, headed all, being the
river, for the goal, longing, desiring, suffering, and the river's voice
sounded full of yearning, full of burning woe, full of unsat

was the world.  all of it together was the flow of
events, was the music of life.  and when siddhartha was listening
attentively to this river, this song of a thousand voices, when he
neither listened to the suffering nor the laughter, when he did not tie
his soul to any particular voice and submerged his self into it, but
when he heard them all, perceived the whole, the oneness, then the great
song of the thousand voices consisted of a single word, which was om:
the perfection.

"do you hear," vasudeva's gaze asked again.

brightly, vasudeva's smile was shining, floating radiantly over all the
wrinkles of his old face, as the om was floating in the air over all the
voices of the river.  brightly his smile was shining, when he looked at
his friend, and brightly the same smile was now starting to shine on
siddhartha's face as well.  his wound blossomed, his suffering was
shining, his self had flown into the oneness.

in this hour, siddhartha stopped fighting his fate, stopped suffering.
on his

face flourished the cheerfulness of a knowledge, which is no
longer opposed by any will, which knows perfection, which is in
agreement with the flow of events, with the current of life, full of
sympathy for the pain of others, full of sympathy for the pleasure of
others, devoted to the flow, belonging to the oneness.

when vasudeva rose from the seat by the bank, when he looked into
siddhartha's eyes and saw the cheerfulness of the knowledge shining
in them, he softly touched his shoulder with his hand, in this careful
and tender manner, and said:  "i've been waiting for this hour, my dear.
now that it has come, let me leave.  for a long time, i've been waiting
for this hour; for a long time, i've been vasudeva the ferryman.  now
it's enough.  farewell, hut, farewell, river, farewell, siddhartha!"

siddhartha made a deep

bow before him who bid his farewell.

"i've known it," he said quietly.  "you'll go into the forests?"

"i'm going into the forests, i'm going into the oneness," spoke vasudeva
with a bright smile.

with a bright smile, he left; siddhartha watched him leaving.  with deep
joy, with deep solemnity he watched him leave, saw his steps full of
peace, saw his head full of lustre, saw his body full of light.




govinda

together with other monks, govinda used to spend the time of rest
between pilgrimages in the pleasure-grove, which the courtesan kamala
had given to the followers of gotama for a gift.  he heard talk of an
old ferryman, who lived one day's journey away by th

n't have
recognised you this time as well!  from my heart, i'm greeting you,
siddhartha; from my heart, i'm happy to see you once again!  you've
changed a lot, my friend.--and so you've now become a ferryman?"

in a friendly manner, siddhartha laughed.  "a ferryman, yes.  many
people, govinda, have to change a lot, have to wear many a robe, i am
one of those, my dear.  be welcome, govinda, and spend the night in my
hut."

govinda stayed the night in the hut and slept on the bed which used to
be vasudeva's bed.  many questions he posed to the friend of his youth,
many things siddhartha had to tell him from his life.

when in the next morning the time had come to start the day's journey,
govinda said, not without hesitation, these words:  "before i'll
continue on my path, siddhartha, permit me to ask one more question.
do you have a teaching?  do you have a faith, or a knowledge, you
follow, which helps you to live and to do right?"

quoth siddhartha:  "you know, my dear, that i already as a you

 with this.  nevertheless, i have had many teachers since then.  a
beautiful courtesan has been my teacher for a long time, and a rich
merchant was my teacher, and some gamblers with dice.  once, even a
follower of buddha, travelling on foot, has been my teacher; he sat with
me when i had fallen asleep in the forest, on the pilgrimage.  i've also
learned from him, i'm also grateful to him, very grateful.  but most of
all, i have learned here from this river and from my predecessor, the
ferryman vasudeva.  he was a very simple person, vasudeva, he was no
thinker, but he knew what is necessary just as well as gotama, he was a
perfect man, a saint."

govinda said:  "still, oh siddhartha, you love a bit to mock people, as
it seems to me.  i believe in you and know that you haven't followed a
teacher.  but haven't you found something by yourself, though you've
found no teachings, you still found certain thoughts, certain insights,
which are your own and which help you to live?  if you would like to
