[CHARACTER] - 
                the
peasant laborer--greedy but kind, faithful but cowardly--whom don
quixote takes as his squire. a representation of the common man,
sancho is a foil to don quixote and virtually every other character
in the novel. his proverb-ridden peasant's wisdom and self-sacrificing
christian behavior prove to be the novel's most insightful and honorable
worldview. he has an awestruck love for don quixote but grows self-confident
and saucy, ending the novel by advising his master in matters of
deep personal philosophy.
