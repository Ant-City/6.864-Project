[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER] is one of the only characters in the novel,
besides the giver and jonas, who seems to grapple with difficult
decisions and complex emotions. although [CHARACTER] does not
have access to the memories that give jonas and the giver insight
into human relationships and feelings, he displays many of the characteristics
that were valued in pre-sameness societies. as a nurturer, he feels
a strong connection with the babies he cares for and a deep concern for
their welfare. although he agrees with jonas's mother that "love"
is a meaningless, obscure word, the feelings he displays toward
the newchildren and his family seem very much like love: he delights
in taking care of them and playing with them, he worries about them,
and he makes minor and major sacrifices for their benefit, from
indulging his daughter's fondness for her comfort object to bringing
baby gabriel home to his family every night in the hopes of saving
him from being released. his concern for the newchildren might be
concern about his own personal failure as a nurturer, but he obviously
feels pain and regret when children are released. he also has an
independent streak that is unusual in the community, demonstrated
when he breaks a rule and peeks at gabriel's name in the hopes that
it will help the child.

in the end, however, [CHARACTER] is a product of his
society. under other circumstances, he probably would have loved
the newchildren passionately and fought against all odds for their
survival. but having grown up in a society where release, though
an occasion for sadness, is not considered tragedy, [CHARACTER]
cannot access the deeper feelings that might be available to him. he
regrets the release of newchildren, but he performs releases himself:
not knowing the value of life as jonas does, he cannot appreciate
its loss, and never having felt intense pain, he cannot summon it
for the death of a baby.
