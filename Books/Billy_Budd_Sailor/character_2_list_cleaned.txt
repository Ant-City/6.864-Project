[CHARACTER] - 
                 the
master-at-arms of the bellipotent, an office equivalent
to chief of police on board the ship. behind his back, the crew
refers to claggart with the derogatory nickname "jemmy legs." at
age 
thirty-five, claggart is lean and tall, with a protruding chin and
an authoritative gaze. his brow bespeaks cleverness, and his black
hair contrasts starkly with his pallid complexion. because of his
pale face, he stays out of the sun as much as possible. the narrator
gives few details about claggart's past, although speculation runs
rampant among the crewmembers. it is known that after entering the
navy unusually late in life, claggart rose through the ranks to
attain his present position on the strength of his sobriety, deference
to authority, and patriotism. however, his compliant exterior disguises
a cruel and sinister streak, which the narrator explains is actually
a natural tendency toward evil and depravity.
