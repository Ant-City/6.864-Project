mr kernan turned and walked down the slope of watling street by

the reins knotted to the wheel. damn dangerous thing. some tipperary

ah! ow! donâ€™t be talking! i was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.

old garryowen started growling again at bloom that was skeezing round
the door.

so they started arguing about the point, bloom saying he wouldnâ€™t and he
couldnâ€™t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well
heâ€™d just take a cigar. gob, heâ€™s a prudent member and no mistake.

â€”give us one of your prime stinkers, terry, says joe.

resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a

so of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and
he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and
the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and joe with
him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for

all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and

bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a jacobsâ€™ tin he told terry to
bring. gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging
out of him a yard long for more. near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody

and the citizen and bloom having an argument about the point, the
brothers sheares and wolfe tone beyond on arbour hill and robert emmet

sheâ€™s far from the land. and bloom, of course, with his knockmedown

â€”you donâ€™t grasp my point, says bloom. what i mean is...

â€”sinn fein! says the citizen. sinn fein amhain! the friends we love are
by our side and the foes we hate before us.

gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums

â€”god blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart. blimey it
makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when i sees her cause
i thinks of my old mashtub whatâ€™s waiting for me down limehouse way.

so then the citizen begins talking about the irish language and the
corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that canâ€™t speak
their own language and joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a
quid and bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that
he cadged off of joe and talking about the gaelic league and the
antitreating league and drink, the curse of ireland. antitreating is
about the size of it. gob, heâ€™d let you pour all manner of drink down

shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. and one or two

so howandever, as i was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty
starts mousing around by joe and me. iâ€™d train him by kindness, so i
would, if he was my dog. give him a rousing fine kick now and again
where it wouldnâ€™t blind him.

â€”afraid heâ€™ll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.

â€”no, says i. but he might take my leg for a lamppost.

so he calls the old dog over.

â€”whatâ€™s on you, garry? says he.

then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in irish and the
old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.

so terry brought the three pints.

â€”thereâ€™s the man, says joe, that made the gaelic sports revival. there
he is sitting there. the man that got away james stephens. the champion
of all ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. what was your best

â€”put it there, citizen, says joe. you were and a bloody sight better.

â€”is that really a fact? says alf.

â€”yes, says bloom. thatâ€™s well known. did you not know that?

so off they started about irish sports and shoneen games the like of

they rose in their seats, those twelve of iar, and they swore by

foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge
against him for he was a malefactor.

â€”those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to ireland
filling the country with bugs.

so bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with joe,
telling him he neednâ€™t trouble about that little matter till the first
but if he would just say a word to mr crawford. and so joe swore high
and holy by this and by that heâ€™d do the devil and all.

after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and

â€”theyâ€™re not european, says the citizen. i was in europe with kevin egan
of paris. you wouldnâ€™t see a trace of them or their language anywhere in
europe except in a cabinet dâ€™aisance.

and says john wyse:

â€”full many a flower is born to blush unseen.

so he went over to the biscuit tin bob doran left to see if there was
anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his
luck with his mangy snout up. old mother hubbard went to the cupboard.

â€”not there, my child, says he.

â€”keep your pecker up, says joe. sheâ€™d have won the money only for the
other dog.

and j. j. and the citizen arguing about law and history with bloom
sticking in an odd word.

â€”some people, says bloom, can see the mote in othersâ€™ eyes but they
canâ€™t see the beam in their own.

â€”raimeis, says the citizen. thereâ€™s no-one as blind as the fellow that
wonâ€™t see, if you know what that means. where are our missing twenty

and our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! and our

larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. i was

â€”and our eyes are on europe, says the citizen. we had our trade with

pupped, spanish ale in galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.

â€”and will again, says joe.

â€”and with the help of the holy mother of god we will again, says the
citizen, clapping his thigh. our harbours that are empty will be full

about of drudges and whipped serfs.

low by the batteringram and the times rubbed its hands and told the
whitelivered saxons there would soon be as few irish in ireland as
redskins in america. even the grand turk sent us his piastres. but the

poor old woman told us that the french were on the sea and landed at
killala.

bloom was talking and talking with john wyse and he quite excited with
his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.

perpetuating national hatred among nations.

â€”but do you know what a nation means? says john wyse.

â€”yes, says bloom.

€”what is it? says john wyse.

â€”a nation? says bloom. a nation is the same people living in the same
place.

â€”by god, then, says ned, laughing, if thatâ€™s so iâ€™m a nation for iâ€™m
living in the same place for the past five years.

so of course everyone had the laugh at bloom and says he, trying to muck
out of it:

â€”or also living in different places.

â€”that covers my case, says joe.

â€”what is your nation if i may ask? says the citizen.

â€”ireland, says bloom. i was born here. ireland.

the citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and,
gob, he spat a red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.

swab himself dry.

gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.

â€”robbed, says he. plundered. insulted. persecuted. taking what belongs

by auction in morocco like slaves or cattle.

the very opposite of that that is really life.

â€”what? says alf.

â€”love, says bloom. i mean the opposite of hatred. i must go now, says
he to john wyse. just round to the court a moment to see if martin is
there. if he comes just say iâ€™ll be back in a second. just a moment.

whoâ€™s hindering you? and off he pops like greased lightning.

â€”a new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. universal love.

â€”well, says john wyse. isnâ€™t that what weâ€™re told. love your neighbour.

â€”that chap? says the citizen. beggar my neighbour is his motto. love,

â€”well, joe, says i, your very good health and song. more power, citizen.

â€”hurrah, there, says joe.

â€”the blessing of god and mary and patrick on you, says the citizen.

and he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.

â€”we know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket. what
about sanctimonious cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and
children of drogheda to the sword with the bible text god is love pasted
round the mouth of his cannon? the bible! did you read that skit in the
united irishman today about that zulu chief thatâ€™s visiting

â€”whatâ€™s that? says joe.

so the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts
reading out:

yesterday to his majesty the alaki of abeakuta by gold stick in waiting,
lord walkup of walkup on eggs, to tender to his majesty the heartfelt

subsequently executing a charming old abeakutic wardance, in the course
of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause
from the girl hands.

â€”widow woman, says ned. i wouldnâ€™t doubt her. wonder did he put that
bible to the same use as i would.

â€”same only more so, says lenehan. and thereafter in that fruitful land
the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.

â€”and a very good initial too, says joe.

â€”thatâ€™s how itâ€™s worked, says the citizen. trade follows the flag.

â€”where is he? says lenehan. defrauding widows and orphans.

â€”isnâ€™t that a fact, says john wyse, what i was telling the citizen about
bloom and the sinn fein?

â€”thatâ€™s so, says martin. or so they allege.

â€”who made those allegations? says alf.

â€”i, says joe. iâ€™m the alligator.

â€”and after all, says john wyse, why canâ€™t a jew love his country like
the next fellow?

â€”why not? says j. j., when heâ€™s quite sure which country it is.

â€”is he a jew or a gentile or a holy roman or a swaddler or what the hell
is he? says ned. or who is he? no offence, crofton.

in the castle.

â€”isnâ€™t he a cousin of bloom the dentist? says jack power.

â€”not at all, says martin. only namesakes. his name was virag, the
fatherâ€™s name that poisoned himself. he changed it by deedpoll, the
father did.

â€”thatâ€™s the new messiah for ireland! says the citizen. island of saints

â€”well, theyâ€™re still waiting for their redeemer, says martin. for that
matter so are we.

â€”yes, says j. j., and every male thatâ€™s born they think it may be their
messiah. and every jew is in a tall state of excitement, i believe, till
he knows if heâ€™s a father or a mother.

and at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with
acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and

and the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.

mortality. it is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we
are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways. mr m.
mulligan (hyg. et eug. doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which
our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by
inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. these factors, he alleged,
and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity
posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers
and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of
dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennasâ€”these, he
said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of
the race. kalipedia, he prophes

neral of the late mr
patrick dignam.

so to change the subject he read about dignam r. i. p. which, he
reflected, was anything but a gay sendoff. or a change of address
anyway.

â€”this morning (hynes put it in of course) the remains of the late mr
patrick dignam were removed from his residence, no 9 newbridge avenue,
sandymount, for interment in glasnevin. the deceased gentleman was a
most popular and genial personality in city life and his demise after a
brief illness came as a great shock to citizens of all classes by whom
he is deeply regretted. the obsequies, at which many friends of the
deceased were present, were carried out (certainly hynes wrote it with
a nudge from corny) by messrs h. j. oâ€™neill and son, 164 north strand
road. the mourners included: patk. dignam (son), bernard corrigan

had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?

he had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow
of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair
with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the north
circular road opposite mr gavin lowâ€™s place of business where she had
remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular
fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles
equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems,
private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from
the city to the phÅ“nix park and _vice versa_.

why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?

because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel
of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with
continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds,

did stephen participate in his dejection?

he affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding
syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational
reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the
incertitude of the void.

was this affirmation apprehended by bloom?

not verbally. substantially.

what comforted his misapprehension?

that as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from
the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.
