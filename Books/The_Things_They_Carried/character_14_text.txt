et, except it wasn't water, it was a sort of acid, and with each
little droplet you'd feel the stuff eating away at important organs. you'd
try to relax. you'd uncurl your fists and let your thoughts go. well, you'd
think, this isn't so bad. and right then you'd hear gunfire behind you and
your  nuts  would  fly  up  into  your  throat  and  you'd  be  squealing  pig
squeals. that kind of boredom.


i feel guilty sometimes. forty-three years old and i'm still writing war
stories.  my  daughter  kathleen  tells  me  it's  an  obsession,  that  i  should
write about a little girl who finds a million dollars and spends it all on a
shetland pony. in a way, i guess, she's right: i should forget it. but the
thing about remembering is that you don't forget. you take your material
where  you  find  it,  which  is  in  your  life,  at  the  intersection  of  past  and
present. the memory-traffic feeds into a rotary up on your head, where it
goes in circles for a while, then pretty soon imagination flow

then he said, "man, i'm sorry."
then later he said, "why not talk about it?"
then he said, "come on, man, talk."
he was a slim, dead, almost dainty young man of about twenty. he lay
with  one  leg  bent  beneath  him,  his  jaw  in  his  throat,  his  face  neither
expressive  nor  inexpressive.  one  eye  was  shut.  the  other  was  a  star-
shaped hole.

"talk," kiowa said.


ambush


when  she  was  nine,  my  daughter  kathleen  asked  if  i  had  ever  killed
anyone. she knew about the war; she knew i'd been a soldier. "you keep
writing  these  war  stories,"  she  said,  "so  i  guess  you  must've  killed
somebody."  it  was  a  difficult  moment,  but  i  did  what  seemed  right,
which was to say, "of course not," and then to take her onto my lap and



hold her for a while. someday, i hope, she'll ask again. but here i want to
pretend  she's  a  grown-up.  i  want  to  tell  her  exactly  what  happened,  or

here is the story-truth. he was a slim, dead, almost dainty young man
of about twenty. he lay in the center of a red clay trail near the village of
my khe. his jaw was in his throat. his one eye was shut, the other eye
was a star-shaped hole. i killed him.

what stories can do, i guess, is make things present.
i  can  look  at  things  i  never  looked  at.  i  can  attach  faces  to  grief  and

love and pity and god. i can be brave. i can make myself feel again.

"daddy, tell the truth," kathleen can say, "did you ever kill anybody?"

and i can say, honestly, "of course not."

or i can say, honestly, "yes."


field trip


a  few  months  after  completing  "in  the  field,"  i  returned  with  my
daughter  to  vietnam,  where  we  visited  the  site  of  kiowa's  death,  and
where i looked for signs of forgiveness or personal grace or whatever else
the  land  might  offer.  the  field  was  still  there,  though  not  as  i
remembered  it.  much  smaller,  i  thought,  and  not  nearly

water,  repairing  the  same  narrow  dike  where  we  had  laid  out  kiowa's
body after pulling him from the muck. things were quiet. at one point, i
remember,  one  of  the  farmers  looked  up  and  shaded  his  eyes,  staring
across the field at us, then after a time he wiped his forehead and went
back to work.

i  stood  with  my  arms  folded,  feeling  the  grip  of  sentiment  and  time.

amazing, i thought. twenty years.



behind  me,  in  the  jeep,  my  daughter  kathleen  sat  waiting  with  a
government interpreter, and now and then i could hear the two of them
talking in soft voices. they were already fast friends. neither of them, i
think, understood what all this was about, why i'd insisted that we search
out  this  spot.  it  had  been  a  hard  two-hour  ride  from  quang  ngai  city,
bumpy dirt roads and a hot august sun, ending up at an empty field on
the edge of nowhere.

i took out my camera, snapped a couple of pictures, then stood gazing
out at the

field. after a time kathleen got out of the jeep and stood beside
me.

"you know what i think?" she said. "i think this place stinks. it smells

like . . . god, i don't even know what. it smells rotten."

"it sure does. i know that."
"so when can we go?"
"pretty soon," i said.
she  started  to  say  something  but  then  hesitated.  frowning,  she
squinted out at the field for a second, then shrugged and walked back to
the jeep.


kathleen  had  just  turned  ten,  and  this  trip  was  a  kind  of  birthday
present,  showing  her  the  world,  offering  a  small  piece  of  her  father's
history. for the most part she'd held up well—far better than i—and over
the first two weeks she'd trooped along without complaint as we hit the
obligatory  tourist  stops.  ho  chi  minh's  mausoleum  in  hanoi.  a  model
farm  outside  saigon.  the  tunnels  at  cu  chi.  the  monuments  and
government offices and orphanages. through most

of this, kathleen had
seemed to enjoy the foreignness of it all, the exotic food and animals, and
even  during  those  periods  of  boredom  and  discomfort  she'd  kept  up  a
good-humored tolerance. at the same time, however, she'd seemed a bit
puzzled. the war was as remote to her as cavemen and dinosaurs.

one morning in saigon she'd asked what it was all about. "this whole

war," she said, "why was everybody so mad at everybody else?"

i shook my head. "they weren't mad, exactly. some people wanted one

ng, other people wanted another thing."

"what did you want?"
"nothing," i said. "to stay alive."



"that's all?"
"yes."
kathleen sighed. "well, i don't get it. i mean, how come you were even

here in the first place?"

"i don't know," i said. "because i had to be."
"but why?"
i  tried  to  find  something  to  tell  her,  but  finally  i  shrugged  and  said,

"it's a mystery, i guess. i don't know."

for  the  rest  of  the  day  she  was  very  quiet.  that  night,  though,  just
before  bedtime,  kathleen  put  her  hand  on  my  shoulder  and  said,  "you
know something? sometimes you're pretty weird, aren't you?"

as short, however, and choices had to be
made, and in the end i decided to take her to this piece of ground where
my  friend  kiowa  had  died.  it  seemed  appropriate.  and,  besides,  i  had
business here.

now,  looking  out  at  the  field,  i  wondered  if  it  was  all  a  mistake.
everything was too ordinary. a quiet sunny day, and the field was not the
field i remembered. i pictured kiowa's face, the way he used to smile, but
all i felt was the awkwardness of remembering.

behind  me,  kathleen  let  out  a  little  giggle.  the  interpreter  was

showing her magic tricks.

there were birds and butterflies, the soft rustlings of rural-anywhere.
below, in the earth, the relics of our presence were no doubt still there,
the  canteens  and  bandoliers  and  mess  kits.  this  little  field,  i  thought,



had swallowed so much. my best friend. my pride. my belief in myself as
a  man  of  some  small  dignity  and  courage.  still,  it  was  hard  to  find  any
real emotion. it simply w

he waste that was vietnam, all the vulgarity and horror.

now,  it  was  just  what  it  was.  flat  and  dreary  and  unremarkable.  i
walked up toward the river, trying to pick out specific landmarks, but all
i  recognized  was  a  small  rise  where  jimmy  cross  had  set  up  his
command  post  that  night.  nothing  else.  for  a  while  i  watched  the  two
old farmers working under the hot sun. i took a few more photographs,
waved at the farmers, then turned and moved back to the jeep.

kathleen gave me a little nod.
"well," she said, "i hope you're having fun."
"sure."
"can we go now?"
"in a minute," i said. "just relax."
at the back of the jeep i found the small cloth bundle i'd carried over

from the states.

kathleen's eyes narrowed. "what's that?"
"stuff," i told her.
she  glanced  at  the  bundle  again,  then  hopped  out  of  the  jeep  and
followed me back to the field. we walked past jimmy cross's command
post, past the spot where kiowa had gone under, down to where the field

dipped into the marshland along the river. i took off my shoes and socks.

"okay," kathleen said, "what's going on?"
"a quick swim."
"where?"
"right here," i said. "stay put."
she  watched  me  unwrap  the  cloth  bundle.  inside  were  kiowa's  old

moccasins.



i stripped down to my underwear, took off my wrist-watch, and waded
in. the water was warm against my feet. instantly, i recognized the soft,
fat feel of the bottom. the water here was eight inches deep.

kathleen  seemed  nervous.  she  squinted  at  me,  her  hands  fluttering.
"listen, this is stupid," she said, "you can't even hardly get wet. how can
you swim out there?"

"i'll manage."
"but  it's  not  ...  i  mean,  god,  it's  not  even  water,  it's  like  mush  or

something."

she  pinched  her  nose  and  watched  me  wade  out  to  where  the  water
reached my knees. roughly here, i decided, was where mitchell sanders
had found kiowa's rucksack. i eased myself down, squatting at first, then

tared  at  each  other,  neither  of  us  moving,  i  felt
something go shut in my heart while something else swung open. briefly,
i wondered if the old man might walk over to exchange a few war stories,
but instead he picked up a shovel and raised it over his head and held it
there for a time, grimly, like a flag, then he brought the shovel down and



said  something  to  his  friend  and  began  digging  into  the  hard,  dry
ground.

i stood up and waded out of the water.
"what  a  mess,"  kathleen  said.  "all  that  gunk  on  your  skin,  you  look
like  .  .  .  wait'll  i  tell  mommy,  she'll  probably  make  you  sleep  in  the
garage."

"you're right," i said. "don't tell her."
i pulled on my shoes, took my daughter's hand, and led her across the

field toward the jeep. soft heat waves shimmied up out of the earth.

when  we  reached  the  jeep,  kathleen  turned  and  glanced  out  at  the

field.

"that old man," she said, "is he mad at you or something?"
"i hope not."
"he looks
