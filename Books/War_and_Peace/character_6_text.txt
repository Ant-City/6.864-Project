 at a ball. â€œletâ€™s
come, quick, quick!â€ and with a glance round, she smiled at tÃ­khon, at
her husband, and at the footman who accompanied them.

â€œis that mary practicing? letâ€™s go quietly and take her by surprise.â€

prince andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression.

â€œyouâ€™ve grown older, tÃ­khon,â€ he said in passing to the old man, who
kissed his hand.

before they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord
came, the pretty, fair-haired frenchwoman, mademoiselle bourienne,
rushed out apparently beside herself with delight.

â€œah! what joy for the princess!â€ exclaimed she: â€œat last! i must let her
know.â€

â€œno, no, please not... you are mademoiselle bourienne,â€ said the little
princess, kissing her. â€œi know you already through my sister-in-lawâ€™s
friendship for you. she was not expecting us?â€

they went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound
of the oft-repeated passage of the sonata. prince andrew stopped and
made a grimace, a

the little princess entered the room. the passage broke off in the
middle, a cry was heard, then princess maryâ€™s heavy tread and the sound
of kissing. when prince andrew went in the two princesses, who had only
met once before for a short time at his wedding, were in each otherâ€™s
arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they happened to
touch. mademoiselle bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her
heart, with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to cry or to
laugh. prince andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned, as lovers
of music do when they hear a false note. the two women let go of one
another, and then, as if afraid of being too late, seized each otherâ€™s
hands, kissing them and pulling them away, and again began kissing each
other on the face, and then to prince andrewâ€™s surprise both began to
cry and kissed again. mademoiselle

ourienne also began to cry. prince
andrew evidently felt ill at ease, but to the two women it seemed quite
natural that they should cry, and apparently it never entered their
heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting.

â€œah! my dear!... ah! mary!...â€ they suddenly exclaimed, and then
laughed. â€œi dreamed last night...â€â€”â€œyou were not expecting us?...â€ â€œah!
mary, you have got thinner?...â€ â€œand you have grown stouter!...â€

â€œi knew the princess at once,â€ put in mademoiselle bourienne.

â€œand i had no idea!...â€ exclaimed princess mary. â€œah, andrew, i did not
see you.â€

prince andrew and his sister, hand in hand, kissed one another, and
he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever. princess mary had
turned toward her brother, and through her tears the loving, warm,
gentle look of her large luminous eyes, very beautiful at that moment,
rested on prince andrewâ€™s face.

the little princess talked incessantly, her short, downy upper lip

at night. come now, where has this great commander of yours shown his

â€œthat would take too long to tell,â€ answered the son.

â€œwell, then go off to your buonaparte! mademoiselle bourienne, hereâ€™s

excellent french.

â€œyou know, prince, i am not a bonapartist!â€

â€œdieu sait quand reviendra.â€ hummed the prince out of tune and, with a
laugh still more so, he quitted the table.

the little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of
the dinner sat silent, glancing with a frightened look now at her
father-in-law and now at princess mary. when they left the table she
took her sister-in-lawâ€™s a

â€œi... thatâ€™s different. why speak of me? i donâ€™t want any other life,
and canâ€™t, for i know no other. but think, andrew: for a young society
woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her life,
all aloneâ€”for papa is always busy, and i... well, you know what poor
resources i have for entertaining a woman used to the best society.
there is only mademoiselle bourienne....â€

â€œi donâ€™t like your mademoiselle bourienne at all,â€ said prince andrew.

â€œno? she is very nice and kind and, above all, sheâ€™s much to be pitied.
she has no one, no one. to tell the truth, i donâ€™t need her, and sheâ€™s
even in my way. you know i always was a savage, and now am even more

princess mary rose and moved to the door, then stopped and said:
â€œandrew, if you had faith you would have turned to god and asked him
to give you the love you do not feel, and your prayer would have been
answered.â€

â€œwell, maybe!â€ said prince andrew. â€œgo, mÃ¡sha; iâ€™ll come immediately.â€

on the way to his sisterâ€™s room, in the passage which connected one
wing with the other, prince andrew met mademoiselle bourienne smiling
sweetly. it was the third time that day that, with an ecstatic and
artless smile, she had met him in secluded passages.

â€œoh! i thought you were in your room,â€ she said, for some reason
blushing and dropping her eyes.

prince andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly
came over his face. he said nothing to her but looked at her forehead
and hair, without looking at her eyes, with such contempt that the
frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word. when he r

ey. she answered him and continued her chatter.

the coach with six horses was waiting at the porch. it was an autumn
night, so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole.
servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch. the immense
house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows. the
domestic serfs were crowding in the hall, waiting to bid good-by to
the young prince. the members of the household were all gathered in
the reception hall: michael ivÃ¡novich, mademoiselle bourienne, princess
mary, and the little princess. prince andrew had been called to his
fatherâ€™s study as the latter wished to say good-by to him alone. all
were waiting for them to come out.

when prince andrew entered the study the old man in his old-age
spectacles and white dressing gown, in which he received no one but his
son, sat at the table writing. he glanced round.

â€œgoing?â€ and he went on writing.

â€œiâ€™ve come to say good-by.â€

â€œkiss me here,â€ and he touched his cheek: â€œthanks

â€œandrew, already!â€ said the little princess, turning pale and looking
with dismay at her husband.

he embraced her. she screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder.

he cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on, looked into her face,
and carefully placed her in an easy chair.

â€œadieu, mary,â€ said he gently to his sister, taking her by the hand and
kissing her, and then he left the room with rapid steps.

the little princess lay in the armchair, mademoiselle bourienne chafing
her temples. princess mary, supporting her sister-in-law, still looked
with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which prince
andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction. from
the study, like pistol shots, came the frequent sound of the old man
angrily blowing his nose. hardly had prince andrew gone when the study
door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white
dressing gown looked out.

â€œgone? thatâ€™s all right!â€ said he; an

¡tych, the overseer, had not the latter instinctively avoided the
blow. â€œthought... blackguards...â€ shouted the prince rapidly.

but although alpÃ¡tych, frightened at his own temerity in avoiding the
stroke, came up to the prince, bowing his bald head resignedly before
him, or perhaps for that very reason, the prince, though he continued to
shout: â€œblackguards!... throw the snow back on the road!â€ did not lift
his stick again but hurried into the house.

before dinner, princess mary and mademoiselle bourienne, who knew
that the prince was in a bad humor, stood awaiting him; mademoiselle
bourienne with a radiant face that said: â€œi know nothing, i am the same
as usual,â€ and princess mary pale, frightened, and with downcast eyes.
what she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions she
ought to behave like mademoiselle bourienne, but could not. she thought:
â€œif i seem not to notice he will think that i do not sympathize with
him; if i seem sad and out of spirits myself, he will say (

as he has
done before) that iâ€™m in the dumps.â€

the prince looked at his daughterâ€™s frightened face and snorted.

â€œfool... or dummy!â€ he muttered.

â€œand the other one is not here. theyâ€™ve been telling tales,â€ he
thoughtâ€”referring to the little princess who was not in the dining room.

â€œwhere is the princess?â€ he asked. â€œhiding?â€

â€œshe is not very well,â€ answered mademoiselle bourienne with a bright
smile, â€œso she wonâ€™t come down. it is natural in her state.â€

â€œhm! hm!â€ muttered the prince, sitting down.

his plate seemed to him not quite clean, and pointing to a spot he
flung it away. tÃ­khon caught it and handed it to a footman. the little
princess was not unwell, but had such an overpowering fear of the prince
that, hearing he was in a bad humor, she had decided not to appear.

â€œi am afraid for the baby,â€ she said to mademoiselle bourienne: â€œheaven

at a fright might do.â€

in general at bald hills the little princess lived in constant fear, and
with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not
realize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling. the prince
reciprocated this antipathy, but it was overpowered by his contempt
for her. when the little princess had grown accustomed to life at bald
hills, she took a special fancy to mademoiselle bourienne, spent whole
days with her, asked her to sleep in her room, and often talked with her
about the old prince and criticized him.

â€œso we are to have visitors, mon prince?â€ remarked mademoiselle
bourienne, unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers. â€œhis
excellency prince vasÃ­li kurÃ¡gin and his son, i understand?â€ she said
inquiringly.

â€œhm!â€”his excellency is a puppy.... i got him his appointment in the
service,â€ said the prince disdainfully. â€œwhy his son is coming i donâ€™

eh? afraid of the â€˜ministerâ€™ as that idiot alpÃ¡tych called him this
morning?â€

â€œno, mon pÃ¨re.â€

though mademoiselle bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice
of a subject, she did not stop talking, but chattered about the
conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened, and
after the soup the prince became more genial.

after dinner, he went to see his daughter-in-law. the little princess
was sitting at a small table, chattering with mÃ¡sha, her maid. she grew
pale on seeing her father-in-law.

she was much altered. she was now plain rather than pretty. her cheeks
had sunk, her lip was drawn up,

tsâ€™ rooms that
the minister and his son had arrived, but the appearance of both had
been minutely described. princess mary was sitting alone in her room,
vainly trying to master her agitation.

â€œwhy did they write, why did lise tell me about it? it can never
happen!â€ she said, looking at herself in the glass. â€œhow shall i enter
the drawing room? even if i like him i canâ€™t now be myself with him.â€
the mere thought of her fatherâ€™s look filled her with terror. the little
princess and mademoiselle bourienne had already received from mÃ¡sha,
the ladyâ€™s maid, the necessary report of how handsome the ministerâ€™s son
was, with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows, and with what difficulty
the father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son had followed him
like an eagle, three steps at a time. having received this information,
the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne, whose chattering voices
had reached her from the corridor, went into princess maryâ€™s room.

â€œyou know theyâ€™ve come, mari

e?â€ said the little princess, waddling in,
and sinking heavily into an armchair.

she was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning,
but had on one of her best dresses. her hair was carefully done and her
face was animated, which, however, did not conceal its sunken and faded
outlines. dressed as she used to be in petersburg society, it was still
more noticeable how much plainer she had become. some unobtrusive touch
had been added to mademoiselle bourienneâ€™s toilet which rendered her
fresh and pretty face yet more attractive.

â€œwhat! are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?â€ she began.
â€œtheyâ€™ll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room and we
shall have to go down, and you have not smartened yourself up at all!â€

the little princess got up, rang for the maid, and hurriedly and merrily
began to devise and carry out a plan of how princess mary should be
dressed. princess maryâ€™s self-esteem was wounded by the f

that
the arrival of a suitor agitated her, and still more so by both her
companionsâ€™ not having the least conception that it could be otherwise.
to tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them would be to
betray her agitation, while to decline their offers to dress her would
prolong their banter and insistence. she flushed, her beautiful eyes
grew dim, red blotches came on her face, and it took on the unattractive
martyrlike expression it so often wore, as she submitted herself to
mademoiselle bourienne and lise. both these women quite sincerely tried
to make her look pretty. she was so plain that neither of them could
think of her as a rival, so they began dressing her with perfect
sincerity, and with the naÃ¯ve and firm conviction women have that dress
can make a face pretty.

â€œno really, my dear, this dress is not pretty,â€ said lise, looking
sideways at princess mary from a little distance. â€œyou have a maroon
dress, have it fetched. really! you know the fate of your whole life may

at stake. but this one is too light, itâ€™s not becoming!â€

it was not the dress, but the face and whole figure of princess mary
that was not pretty, but neither mademoiselle bourienne nor the little
princess felt this; they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed
in the hair, the hair combed up, and the blue scarf arranged lower on
the best maroon dress, and so on, all would be well. they forgot that
the frightened face and the figure could not be altered, and that
however they might change the setting and adornment of that face, it
would still remain piteous and plain. after two or three changes to

maid, â€œbring the princess her gray dress, and youâ€™ll see, mademoiselle
bourienne, how i shall arrange it,â€ she added, smiling with a foretaste
of artistic pleasure.

but when katie brought the required dress, princess mary remained
sitting motionless before the glass, looking at her face, and saw in the
mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering, ready to burst
into sobs.

â€œcome, dear princess,â€ said mademoiselle bourienne, â€œjust one more
little effort.â€

the little princess, taking the dress from the maid, came up to princess
mary.

â€œwell, now weâ€™ll arrange something quite simple and becoming,â€ she said.

the three voices, hers, mademoiselle bourienneâ€™s, and katieâ€™s, who was
laughing at something, mingled in a merry sound, like the chirping of
birds.

â€œno, leave me alone,â€ said princess mary.

her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds
was silenced at once. they look

ed at the beautiful, large, thoughtful
eyes full of tears and of thoughts, gazing shiningly and imploringly at
them, and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist.

â€œat least, change your coiffure,â€ said the little princess. â€œdidnâ€™t i
tell you,â€ she went on, turning reproachfully to mademoiselle bourienne,
â€œmaryâ€™s is a face which such a coiffure does not suit in the least. not
in the least! please change it.â€

â€œleave me alone, please leave me alone! it is all quite the same to me,â€
answered a voice struggling with tears.

mademoiselle bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves
that princess mary in this guise looked very plain, worse than usual,
but it was too late. she was looking at them with an expression they
both knew, an expression thoughtful and sad. this express

and having crossed herself went down, thinking neither of her gown and
coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say. what
could all that matter in comparison with the will of god, without whose
care not a hair of manâ€™s head can fall?





chapter iv

when princess mary came down, prince vasÃ­li and his son were already
in the drawing room, talking to the little princess and mademoiselle
bourienne. when she entered with her heavy step, treading on her heels,
the gentlemen and mademoiselle bourienne rose and the little princess,
indicating her to the gentlemen, said: â€œvoilÃ  marie!â€ princess mary saw
them all and saw them in detail. she saw prince vasÃ­liâ€™s face, serious
for an instant at the sight of her, but immediately smiling again, and
the little princess curiously noting the impression â€œmarieâ€ produced on
the visitors. and she saw mademoiselle bourienne, with her ribbon and
pretty face, and her unusually animated look which was fixed on him,
but him she could not see, she o

ings on. oh!â€ and she shook her finger at
him, â€œi have even heard of your doings in paris!â€

â€œand didnâ€™t hippolyte tell you?â€ asked prince vasÃ­li, turning to his son
and seizing the little princessâ€™ arm as if she would have run away and
he had just managed to catch her, â€œdidnâ€™t he tell you how he himself was
pining for the dear princess, and how she showed him the door? oh, she
is a pearl among women, princess,â€ he added, turning to princess mary.

when paris was mentioned, mademoiselle bourienne for her part seized the
opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections.

she took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since anatole
had left paris and how he had liked that city. anatole answered the
frenchwoman very readily and, looking at her with a smile, talked to her
about her native land. when he saw the pretty little bourienne, anatole
came to the conclusion that he would not find bald hills dull either.
â€œnot at all bad!â€ he thought, examining her, â€œnot at

his birth and position in society were not bad. â€œwell, iâ€™ve nothing
against it,â€ the prince said to himself, â€œbut he must be worthy of her.
and that is what we shall see.â€

â€œthat is what we shall see! that is what we shall see!â€ he added aloud.

he entered the drawing room with his usual alert step, glancing rapidly
round the company. he noticed the change in the little princessâ€™ dress,
mademoiselle bourienneâ€™s ribbon, princess maryâ€™s unbecoming coiffure,
mademoiselle bourienneâ€™s and anatoleâ€™s smiles, and the loneliness of his
daughter amid the general conversation. â€œgot herself up like a fool!â€
he thought, looking irritably at her. â€œshe is shameless, and he ignores
her!â€

he went straight up to prince vasÃ­li.

â€œwell! how dâ€™ye do? how dâ€™ye do? glad to see you!â€

â€œfriendship laughs at distance,â€ began prince vasÃ­li in his usual rapid,
self-confident, familiar tone. â€œhe

ousands of dreams of a future
family life continually rose in her imagination. she drove them away and
tried to conceal them.

â€œbut am i not too cold with him?â€ thought the princess. â€œi try to be
reserved because in the depth of my soul i feel too near to him already,
but then he cannot know what i think of him and may imagine that i do
not like him.â€

and princess mary tried, but could not manage, to be cordial to her new
guest. â€œpoor girl, sheâ€™s devilish ugly!â€ thought anatole.

mademoiselle bourienne, also roused to great excitement by anatoleâ€™s
arrival, thought in another way. of course, she, a handsome young woman
without any definite position, without relations or even a country, did
not intend to devote her life to serving prince bolkÃ³nski, to reading
aloud to him and being friends with princess mary. mademoiselle
bourienne had long been waiting for a russian prince who, able to
appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain, badly dressed,
ungainly russian princesses, would fal

off; and here at last was a russian prince. mademoiselle bourienne knew
a story, heard from her aunt but finished in her own way, which she
liked to repeat to herself. it was the story of a girl who had been
seduced, and to whom her poor mother (sa pauvre mÃ¨re) appeared, and
reproached her for yielding to a man without being married. mademoiselle
bourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this
story to him, her seducer. and now he, a real russian prince, had
appeared. he would carry her away and then sa pauvre mÃ¨re would appear
and he wo

 little princess, like an old war horse that hears the trumpet,
unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition, prepared for the
familiar gallop of coquetry, without any ulterior motive or any
struggle, but with naÃ¯ve and lighthearted gaiety.

although in female society anatole usually assumed the role of a man
tired of being run after by women, his vanity was flattered by the
spectacle of his power over these three women. besides that, he was
beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative mademoiselle bourienne
that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great
suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions.

after tea, the company went into the sitting room and princess mary was
asked to play on the clavichord. anatole, laughing and in high spirits,
came and leaned on his elbows, facing her and beside mademoiselle
bourienne. princess mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion.
her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and the
look

 she felt upon her made that world still more poetic. but anatoleâ€™s
expression, though his eyes were fixed on her, referred not to her but
to the movements of mademoiselle bourienneâ€™s little foot, which he was
then touching with his own under the clavichord. mademoiselle bourienne
was also looking at princess mary, and in her lovely eyes there was a
look of fearful joy and hope that was also new to the princess.

â€œhow she loves me!â€ thought princess mary. â€œhow happy i am now, and how
happy i may be with such a friend and such a husband! husband? can it
be possible?â€ she thought, not daring to look at his face, but still
feeling his eyes gazing at her.

in the evening, after supper, when all were about to retire, anatole
kissed princess maryâ€™s hand. she did not

know how she found the courage,
but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to her
shortsighted eyes. turning from princess mary he went up and kissed
mademoiselle bourienneâ€™s hand. (this was not etiquette, but then he did
everything so simply and with such assurance!) mademoiselle bourienne
flushed, and gave the princess a frightened look.

â€œwhat delicacy!â€ thought the princess. â€œis it possible that amÃ©lieâ€
(mademoiselle bourienne) â€œthinks i could be jealous of her, and not
value her pure affection and devotion to me?â€ she went up to her and
kissed her warmly. anatole went up to kiss the little princessâ€™ hand.

â€œno! no! no! when your father writes to tell me that you are behaving
well i will give you my hand to kiss. not till then!â€ she said. and
smilingly raising a finger at him, she left the room.

got into bed, all kept awak

long time that night.

â€œis he really to be my husband, this stranger who is so kindâ€”yes, kind,
that is the chief thing,â€ thought princess mary; and fear, which she had
seldom experienced, came upon her. she feared to look round, it seemed
to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the dark
corner. and this someone was heâ€”the devilâ€”and he was also this man with
the white forehead, black eyebrows, and red lips.

she rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room.

mademoiselle bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long
time that evening, vainly expecting someone, now smiling at someone, now
working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre mÃ¨re
rebuking her for her fall.

the little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made.
she could not lie either on her face or on her side. every position was
awkward and uncomfortable, and her burden oppressed her now more than
ever because anatoleâ€™s presence had vividly recalled to her the

pride enough to see it? if she has no pride for herself she might at
least have some for my sake! she must be shown that the blockhead thinks
nothing of her and looks only at bourienne. no, she has no pride... but
iâ€™ll let her see....â€

the old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a
mistake and that anatole meant to flirt with mademoiselle bourienne,
princess maryâ€™s self-esteem would be wounded and his point (not to
be parted from her) would be gained, so pacifying himself with this
thought, he called tÃ­khon and began to undress.

â€œwhat devil brought them here?â€ thought he, while tÃ­khon was putting the
nightshirt over his dried-up old body and gray-haired chest. â€œi never
invited them. they came to disturb my lifeâ€”and there is not much of it
left.â€

â€œdevil take â€˜em!â€ he muttered, while his head was still covered by the

e to bed?â€ asked the prince.

tÃ­khon, like all good valets, instinctively knew the direction of his
masterâ€™s thoughts. he guessed that the question referred to prince
vasÃ­li and his son.

â€œthey have gone to bed and put out their lights, your excellency.â€

â€œno good... no good...â€ said the prince rapidly, and thrusting his feet
into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing gown, he
went to the couch on which he slept.

though no words had passed between anatole and mademoiselle bourienne,
they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance,
up to the appearance of the pauvre mÃ¨re; they understood that they had
much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an
opportunity since morning to meet one another alone. when princess mary
went to her fatherâ€™s room at the usual hour, mademoiselle bourienne and
anatole met in the conservatory.

princess mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation.
it seemed to her that not only di

garded the matter with disapproval,
but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be
decided now or never. she lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze
under which she felt that she could not think, but would only be able to
submit from habit, and she said: â€œi wish only to do your will, but if
i had to express my own desire...â€ she had no time to finish. the old
prince interrupted her.

â€œthatâ€™s admirable!â€ he shouted. â€œhe will take you with your dowry and
take mademoiselle bourienne into the bargain. sheâ€™ll be the wife, while
you...â€

the prince stopped. he saw the effect these words had produced on his
daughter. she lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears.

â€œnow then, now then, iâ€™m only joking!â€ he said. â€œremember this,
princess, i hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to
choose. i give you freedom. only remember that your lifeâ€™s happiness
depends on your decision. never mind me!â€

â€œbut i do not know, father!â€

princess, as if lost in a fog, had already staggered out of the study.

her fate was decided and happily decided. but what her father had said
about mademoiselle bourienne was dreadful. it was untrue to be sure, but
still it was terrible, and she could not help thinking of it. she was
going straight on through the conservatory, neither seeing nor hearing
anything, when suddenly the well-known whispering of mademoiselle
bourienne aroused her. she raised her eyes, and two steps away saw
anatole embracing the frenchwoman and whispering something to her. with
a horrified expression on his handsome face, anatole looked at princess
mary, but did not at once take his ar

â€œwhoâ€™s that? why? wait a moment!â€ anatoleâ€™s face seemed to say. princess

mademoiselle bourienne gave a scream and ran away. anatole bowed to
princess mary with a gay smile, as if inviting her to join in a laugh at
this strange incident, and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door
that led to his own apartments.

an hour later, tÃ­khon came to call princess mary to the old prince;
he added that prince vasÃ­li was also there. when tÃ­khon came to her
princess mary was sitting on the sofa in her room, holding the weeping
mademoiselle bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair.

â€œwhy? i love you more than ever,â€ said princess mary, â€œand i will try to

â€œbut you despise me. you who are so pure can never understand being so
carried away by passion. oh, only my poor mother...â€

rdinates, and went into everything down to the
minutest details himself. princess mary had ceased taking lessons in
mathematics from her father, and when the old prince was at home went
to his study with the wet nurse and little prince nicholas (as his
grandfather called him). the baby prince nicholas lived with his wet
nurse and nurse sÃ¡vishna in the late princessâ€™ rooms and princess mary
spent most of the day in the nursery, taking a motherâ€™s place to her
little nephew as best she could. mademoiselle bourienne, too, seemed
passionately fond of the boy, and princess mary often deprived herself
to give her friend the pleasure of dandling the little angelâ€”as she
called her nephewâ€”and playing with him.

near the altar of the church at bald hills there was a chapel over the
tomb of the little princess, and in this chapel was a marble monument
brought from italy, representing an angel with outspread wings ready to
fly upwards. the angelâ€™s upper lip was slightly raised as though

princess mary, though he had scarcely known them, pierre at once felt
like an old friend. they were all fond of him already. not only princess
mary, who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims, gave him her
most radiant looks, but even the one-year-old â€œprince nicholasâ€ (as his
grandfather called him) smiled at pierre and let himself be taken in
his arms, and michael ivÃ¡novich and mademoiselle bourienne looked at him
with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince.

the old prince came in to supper; this was evidently on pierreâ€™s
account. and during the two days of the young manâ€™s visit he was
extremely kind to him and told him to visit them again.

when pierre had gone and the members of the household met together, they
began to express their opinions of him as people always do after a new
acquaintance has left, but as seldom happens, no one said anything but
what was good of him.

ly as harshly as possible. princess mary had
two passions and consequently two joysâ€”her nephew, little nicholas, and
religionâ€”and these were the favorite subjects of the princeâ€™s attacks
and ridicule. whatever was spoken of he would bring round to the
superstitiousness of old maids, or the petting and spoiling of children.
â€œyou want to make himâ€â€”little nicholasâ€”â€œinto an old maid like yourself!

joke about them.

could her father, whom she knew loved her in spite of it all, be unjust?

chapter xxvi

in the middle of the summer princess mary received an unexpected letter
from prince andrew in switzerland in which he gave her strange and
surprising news. he informed her of his engagement to natÃ¡sha rostÃ³va.
the whole letter breathed loving rapture for his betrothed and tender
and confiding affection for his sister. he wrote that he had never loved
as he did now and that only now did he understand and know what life
was. he asked his sister to for

my houseâ€”let him marry and live by himself. perhaps you will go and live
with him too?â€ he added, turning to princess mary. â€œgo in heavenâ€™s name!
go out into the frost... the frost... the frost!â€

after this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the matter.
but repressed vexation at his sonâ€™s poor-spirited behavior found
expression in his treatment of his daughter. to his former pretexts
for irony a fresh one was now addedâ€”allusions to stepmothers and
amiabilities to mademoiselle bourienne.

â€œwhy shouldnâ€™t i marry her?â€ he asked his daughter. â€œsheâ€™ll make a
splendid princess!â€

and latterly, to her surprise and bewilderment, princess mary
noticed that her father was really associating more and more with the
frenchwoman. she wrote to prince andrew about the reception of his
letter, but comforted him with hopes of reconciling their father to the
idea.

little nicholas and his education, her brother andrew, and religion were
princess maryâ€™s joys and consolations; but b

that her father would not let her go
anywhere without him, and his failing health prevented his going out
himself, so that she was not invited to dinners and evening parties. she
had quite abandoned the hope of getting married. she saw the coldness
and malevolence with which the old prince received and dismissed the
young men, possible suitors, who sometimes appeared at their house. she
had no friends: during this visit to moscow she had been disappointed in
the two who had been nearest to her. mademoiselle bourienne, with whom
she had never been able to be quite frank, had now become unpleasant to
her, and for various reasons princess mary avoided her. julie, with whom
she had corresponded for the last five years, was in moscow, but proved
to be quite alien to her when they met. just then julie, who by the
death of her brothers had become one of the richest heiresses in moscow,
was in the full whirl of society pleasures. she was surrounded by young
men who, she fancied, had suddenly learned to appreciate h

ground all night, had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water, it
would never have entered her mind to think her position hard; but this
loving despotâ€”the more cruel because he loved her and for that reason
tormented himself and herâ€”knew how not merely to hurt and humiliate
her deliberately, but to show her that she was always to blame for
everything. of late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented princess
mary more than anything else; this was his ever-increasing intimacy with
mademoiselle bourienne. the idea that at the first moment of receiving
the news of his sonâ€™s intentions had occurred to him in jestâ€”that
if andrew got married he himself would marry bourienneâ€”had evidently
pleased him, and latterly he had persistently, and as it seemed to
princess mary merely to offend her, shown special endearments to
the companion and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter by
demonstrations of love of bourienne.

one day in moscow in princess maryâ€™s presence (she thought her father

did it purposely when she was there) the old prince kissed mademoiselle
bourienneâ€™s hand and, drawing her to him, embraced her affectionately.
princess mary flushed and ran out of the room. a few minutes later
mademoiselle bourienne came into princess maryâ€™s room smiling and making
cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice. princess mary hastily wiped
away her tears, went resolutely up to mademoiselle bourienne, and
evidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angry
haste at the frenchwoman, her voice breaking: â€œitâ€™s horrible, vile,
inhuman, to take advantage of the weakness...â€ she did not finish.
â€œleave my room,â€ she exclaimed, and burst into sobs.

next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter, but she noticed
that at dinner he gave orders that mademoiselle bourienne should be
served first. after dinner, when the footman handed coffee and from
habit began with th

conscripted for the army.

â€œhe doesnâ€™t obey... i said it twice... and he doesnâ€™t obey! she is the
first person in this house; sheâ€™s my best friend,â€ cried the prince.
â€œand if you allow yourself,â€ he screamed in a fury, addressing princess
mary for the first time, â€œto forget yourself again before her as you
dared to do yesterday, i will show you who is master in this house. go!
donâ€™t let me set eyes on you; beg her pardon!â€

princess mary asked mademoiselle bourienneâ€™s pardon, and also her
fatherâ€™s pardon for herself and for philip the footman, who had begged
for her intervention.

at such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her
soul. and suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for his
spectacles in her presence, fumbling near them and not seeing them, or
would forget something that had just occurred, or take a false step with
his failing legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed his feebleness,

herself.





chapter iii

in 1811 there was living in moscow a french doctorâ€”mÃ©tivierâ€”who had
rapidly become the fashion. he was enormously tall, handsome, amiable
as frenchmen are, and was, as all moscow said, an extraordinarily clever
doctor. he was received in the best houses not merely as a doctor, but
as an equal.

prince nicholas had always ridiculed medicine, but latterly on
mademoiselle bourienneâ€™s advice had allowed this doctor to visit him and
had grown accustomed to him. mÃ©tivier came to see the prince about twice
a week.

on december 6â€”st. nicholasâ€™ day and the princeâ€™s name dayâ€”all moscow
came to the princeâ€™s front door but he gave orders to admit no one
and to invite to dinner only a small number, a list of whom he gave to
princess mary.

mÃ©tivier, who came in the morning with his felicitations, considered
it proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne, * a

s, then both
voices began speaking at the same time, the door was flung open, and
on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified mÃ©tivier
with his shock of black hair, and the prince in his dressing gown and
fez, his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes rolled
downwards.

â€œyou donâ€™t understand?â€ shouted the prince, â€œbut i do! french spy, slave
of buonaparte, spy, get out of my house! be off, i tell you...â€

mÃ©tivier, shrugging his shoulders, went up to mademoiselle bourienne who
at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room.

â€œthe prince is not very well: bile and rush of blood to the head.
keep calm, i will call again tomorrow,â€ said mÃ©tivier; and putting his
fingers to his lips he hastened away.

through the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry:
â€œspies, traitors, traitors everywhere! not a momentâ€™s peace in my own
house!â€

after mÃ©tivierâ€™s departure the old prince called his daughter in, and

to appear calm added: â€œand donâ€™t imagine i have said this in a moment of
anger. i am calm. i have thought it over, and it will be carried
outâ€”we must part; so find some place for yourself....â€ but he could not
restrain himself and with the virulence of which only one who loves
is capable, evidently suffering himself, he shook his fists at her and
screamed:

â€œif only some fool would marry her!â€ then he slammed the door, sent for
mademoiselle bourienne, and subsided into his study.

at two oâ€™clock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner.

these guestsâ€”the famous count rostopchÃ­n, prince lopukhÃ­n with his
nephew, general chatrÃ³v an old war comrade of the princeâ€™s, and of the
younger generation pierre and borÃ­s drubetskÃ³yâ€”awaited the prince in the
drawing room.

borÃ­s, who had come to moscow on leave a few days before, had been
anxious to be presented to prince nicholas bolkÃ³nski, and had contrived
to ingratiate himself so wel

ome.

when they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the
servants. the footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by
another in the large hall and they whispered to one another. then a
maidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something, mentioning
the princess. at last an old, cross looking footman came and announced
to the rostÃ³vs that the prince was not receiving, but that the princess
begged them to walk up. the first person who came to meet the visitors
was mademoiselle bourienne. she greeted the father and daughter with
special politeness and showed them to the princessâ€™ room. the princess,
looking excited and nervous, her face flushed in patches, ran in to meet
the visitors, treading heavily, and vainly trying to appear cordial and
at ease. from the first glance princess mary did not like natÃ¡sha. she
thought her too fashionably dressed, frivolously gay and vain. she did
not at all realize that before having seen her future sister-in-law she
was prejudiced against

but natÃ¡sha noticed her fatherâ€™s nervousness
and anxiety and felt mortified by it. she blushed for him, grew still
angrier at having blushed, and looked at the princess with a bold and
defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of anybody. the
princess told the count that she would be delighted, and only begged him
to stay longer at anna semÃ«novnaâ€™s, and he departed.

despite the uneasy glances thrown at her by princess maryâ€”who wished to
have a tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte with natÃ¡shaâ€”mademoiselle bourienne remained in
the room and persistently talked about moscow amusements and theaters.
natÃ¡sha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in the anteroom,
by her fatherâ€™s nervousness, and by the unnatural manner of the princess
whoâ€”she thoughtâ€”was making a favor of receiving her, and so everything
displeased her. she did not like princess mary, whom she thought very
plain, affected, and dry. natÃ¡sha suddenly shrank into herself and
involuntarily assumed an offhand air which alienated p

madam. god is my witness, i did not know you had honored us with a
visit, and i came in such a costume only to see my daughter. i beg
you to excuse me... god is my witness, i didnâ€™t know-â€ he repeated,
stressing the word â€œgodâ€ so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that
princess mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at her
father or at natÃ¡sha.

nor did the latter, having risen and curtsied, know what to do.
mademoiselle bourienne alone smiled agreeably.

â€œi beg you to excuse me, excuse me! god is my witness, i did not know,â€
muttered the old man, and after looking natÃ¡sha over from head to foot
he went out.

mademoiselle bourienne was the first to recover herself after this
apparition and began speaking about the princeâ€™s indisposition. natÃ¡sha
and princess mary looked at one another in silence, and the longer they
did so without saying what they wanted to say, the greater grew their
antipathy to one another.

nt returned, natÃ¡sha was impolitely pleased and hastened
to get away: at that moment she hated the stiff, elderly princess, who
could place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an
hour with her without once mentioning prince andrew. â€œi couldnâ€™t begin
talking about him in the presence of that frenchwoman,â€ thought natÃ¡sha.
the same thought was meanwhile tormenting princess mary. she knew what
she ought to have said to natÃ¡sha, but she had been unable to say it
because mademoiselle bourienne was in the way, and because, without
knowing why, she felt it very difficult to speak of the marriage. when
the count was already leaving the room, princess mary went up hurriedly
to natÃ¡sha, took her by the hand, and said with a deep sigh:

â€œwait, i must...â€

natÃ¡sha glanced at her ironically without knowing why.

â€œdear natalie,â€ said princess mary, â€œi want you to know that i am glad
my brother has found happiness....â€

she paused, feeling that she was not telling the truth. natÃ

 all sides gossip about
the attempted abduction of rostÃ³va. he resolutely denied these
rumors, assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his
brother-in-law had proposed to her and been refused. it seemed to
pierre that it was his duty to conceal the whole affair and re-establish
natÃ¡shaâ€™s reputation.

he was awaiting prince andrewâ€™s return with dread and went every day to
the old princeâ€™s for news of him.

old prince bolkÃ³nski heard all the rumors current in the town from
mademoiselle bourienne and had read the note to princess mary in which
natÃ¡sha had broken off her engagement. he seemed in better spirits than
usual and awaited his son with great impatience.

some days after anatoleâ€™s departure pierre received a note from prince
andrew, informing him of his arrival and asking him to come to see him.

as soon as he reached moscow, prince andrew had received from his
father natÃ¡shaâ€™s note to princess mary breaking off her engagement

sleeping castle. the same old stateliness, the same cleanliness, the
same stillness reigned there, and inside there was the same furniture,
the same walls, sounds, and smell, and the same timid faces, only
somewhat older. princess mary was still the same timid, plain maiden
getting on in years, uselessly and joylessly passing the best years of
her life in fear and constant suffering. mademoiselle bourienne was
the same coquettish, self-satisfied girl, enjoying every moment of her
existence and full of joyous hopes for the future. she had merely become
more self-confident, prince andrew thought. dessalles, the tutor he had
brought from switzerland, was wearing a coat of russian cut and
talking broken russian to the servants, but was still the same narrowly
intelligent, conscientious, and pedantic preceptor. the old prince
had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth, which left a

unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth just
as the little princess used to do. he alone did not obey the law of
immutability in the enchanted, sleeping castle. but though externally
all remained as of old, the inner relations of all these people had
changed since prince andrew had seen them last. the household was
divided into two alien and hostile camps, who changed their habits for
his sake and only met because he was there. to the one camp belonged
the old prince, mademoiselle bourienne, and the architect; to the other
princess mary, dessalles, little nicholas, and all the old nurses and
maids.

during his stay at bald hills all the family dined together, but they
were ill at ease and prince andrew felt that he was a visitor for whose
sake an exception was being made and that his presence made them all
feel awkward. involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first day, he
was taciturn, and the old prince noticing this also became morosely dumb
and retired to his apartments di

rectly after dinner. in the evening,
when prince andrew went to him and, trying to rouse him, began to
tell him of the young count kÃ¡menskyâ€™s campaign, the old prince
began unexpectedly to talk about princess mary, blaming her for her
superstitions and her dislike of mademoiselle bourienne, who, he said,
was the only person really attached to him.

the old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of princess
mary: that she purposely worried and irritated him, and that by
indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little prince nicholas. the
old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that her
life was very hard, but he also knew that he could not help tormenting
her and that she deserved it. â€œwhy does prince andrew, who sees this,
say nothing to me ab

ame, but those to blameâ€”the one to blameâ€”is
that frenchwoman.â€

â€œah, he has passed judgment... passed judgement!â€ said the old man in a
low voice and, as it seemed to prince andrew, with some embarrassment,
but then he suddenly jumped up and cried: â€œbe off, be off! let not a
trace of you remain here!...â€

prince andrew wished to leave at once, but princess mary persuaded him
to stay another day. that day he did not see his father, who did not
leave his room and admitted no one but mademoiselle bourienne and
tÃ­khon, but asked several times whether his son had gone. next day,
before leaving, prince andrew went to his sonâ€™s rooms. the boy,
curly-headed like his mother and glowing with health, sat on his knee,
and prince andrew began telling him the story of bluebeard, but fell
into a reverie without finishing the story. he thought not of this
pretty child, his son whom he held on his knee, but of himself. he
sought in himself either remorse for having angered his father or regret
at leaving ho

you say that,
when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old? mademoiselle
bourienne says he has been asking about you....â€

as soon as she began to speak of that, her lips trembled and her tears
began to fall. prince andrew turned away and began pacing the room.

â€œah, my god! my god! when one thinks who and whatâ€”what trashâ€”can cause
people misery!â€ he said with a malignity that alarmed princess mary.

she understood that when speaking of â€œtrashâ€ he referred not only to
mademoiselle bourienne, the cause of her misery, but also to the man who
had ruined his own happiness.

â€œandrew! one thing i beg, i entreat of you!â€ she said, touching his
elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears. â€œi
understand youâ€ (she looked down). â€œdonâ€™t imagine that sorrow is the
work of men. men are his tools.â€ she looked a little above prince
andrewâ€™s head with the confident, accustomed look with which one looks
at the place where a familiar portrait hangs. â€œsorrow is s

me, it hurts. iâ€™m old and weak and this is what you wanted. well then,
gloat over it! gloat over it!â€

after that princess mary did not see her father for a whole week. he was
ill and did not leave his study.

princess mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the
old prince not only excluded her from his room, but did not admit
mademoiselle bourienne either. tÃ­khon alone attended him.

at the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his former way
of life, devoting himself with special activity to building operations
and the arrangement of the gardens and completely breaking off his
relations with mademoiselle bourienne. his looks and cold tone to his
daughter seemed to say: â€œthere, you see? you plotted against me, you
lied to prince andrew about my relations with that frenchwoman and made
me quarrel with him, but you see i need

nce was exceedingly active and even animated.
he planned another garden and began a new building for the domestic
serfs. the only thing that made princess mary anxious about him was that
he slept very little and, instead of sleeping in his study as usual,
changed his sleeping place every day. one day he would order his camp
bed to be set up in the glass gallery, another day he remained on the
couch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and dozed there without
undressing, whileâ€”instead of mademoiselle bourienneâ€”a serf boy read to
him. then again he would spend a night in the dining room.

on august 1, a second letter was received from prince andrew. in his
first letter which came soon after he had left home, prince andrew had
dutifully asked his fatherâ€™s forgiveness for what he had allowed himself
to say and begged to be restored to his favor. to this letter the old
prince had replied affectionately, and from that time had kept the
frenchwoman at a distance. prince andrewâ€™s second letter, writte

maryâ€”â€œhavenâ€™t you read it?â€

â€œno, father,â€ she replied in a frightened voice.

she could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had
arrived.

â€œhe writes about this war,â€ said the prince, with the ironic smile that
had become habitual to him in speaking of the present war.

â€œthat must be very interesting,â€ said dessalles. â€œprince andrew is in a
position to know...â€

â€œoh, very interesting!â€ said mademoiselle bourienne.

â€œgo and get it for me,â€ said the old prince to mademoiselle bourienne.
â€œyou knowâ€”under the paperweight on the little table.â€

mademoiselle bourienne jumped up eagerly.

â€œno, donâ€™t!â€ he exclaimed with a frown. â€œyou go, michael ivÃ¡novich.â€

michael ivÃ¡novich rose and went to the study. but as soon as he had left
the room the old prince, looking uneasily round, threw down his napkin
and went himself.

â€œthey canâ€™t do anything... always make some muddle,â€ he muttered.

while he was away princess mary, dessalles, mademoiselle bourienne, and
even little nicholas exchanged looks in silence. the old prince returned
with quick steps, accompanied by michael ivÃ¡novich, bringing the letter
and a plan. these he put down beside himâ€”not letting anyone read them at
dinner.

on moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to princess mary and,
spreading out before him the plan of the new building and fixing his
eyes upon it, told her to read the letter aloud. when she had done so
princess mary looked inquiringly at her father. he w

far as the pond, along the avenues of young lime trees prince andrew had
planted.

â€œyes... i... i... i wished for his death! yes, i wanted it to end
quicker.... i wished to be at peace.... and what will become of me? what
use will peace be when he is no longer here?â€ princess mary murmured,
pacing the garden with hurried steps and pressing her hands to her bosom
which heaved with convulsive sobs.

when she had completed the tour of the garden, which brought her
again to the house, she saw mademoiselle bourienneâ€”who had remained
at boguchÃ¡rovo and did not wish to leave itâ€”coming toward her with a
stranger. this was the marshal of the nobility of the district, who
had come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for her
prompt departure. princess mary listened without understanding him; she
led him to the house, offered him lunch, and sat down with him. then,
excusing herself, she went to the door of the old princeâ€™s room. the
doctor came out with an agitated face and said she could

rincess mary was looking. the flow of her thoughts
suddenly stopped. unconsciously she sat up, smoothed her hair, got up,
and went to the window, involuntarily inhaling the freshness of the
clear but windy evening.

â€œyes, you can well enjoy the evening now! he is gone and no one will
hinder you,â€ she said to herself, and sinking into a chair she let her
head fall on the window sill.

someone spoke her name in a soft and tender voice from the garden and
kissed her head. she looked up. it was mademoiselle bourienne in a black
dress and weepers. she softly approached princess mary, sighed, kissed
her, and immediately began to cry. the princess looked up at her. all
their former disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind.
but she remembered too how he had changed of late toward mademoiselle
bourienne and could not bear to see her, thereby showing how unjust were
the reproaches princess mary had mentally addressed to her. â€œbesides,
is it for me, for me who desired his death, to condemn anyone?â€

tion is doubly terrible, dear princess,â€ said mademoiselle
bourienne after a pause. â€œi understand that you could not, and cannot,
think of yourself, but with my love for you i must do so.... has
alpÃ¡tych been to you? has he spoken to you of going away?â€ she asked.

princess mary did not answer. she did not understand who was to go or
where to. â€œis it possible to plan or think of anything now? is it not
all the same?â€ she thought, and did not reply.

â€œyou know, chÃ¨re marie,â€ said mademoiselle bourienne, â€œthat we are in
dangerâ€”are surrounded by the french. it would be dangerous to move now.
if we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners, and god knows...â€

princess mary looked at her companion without understanding what she was
talking about.

â€œoh, if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now,â€ she said.
â€œof course i would on no account wish to go away from him.... alpÃ¡tych
did say something about going.... speak to him; i can do nothing,
nothing, and donâ€™t want to...

â€œiâ€™ve spoken to him. he hopes we should be in time to get away tomorrow,
but i think it would now be better to stay here,â€ said mademoiselle
bourienne. â€œbecause, you will agree, chÃ¨re marie, to fall into the hands
of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be terrible.â€

mademoiselle bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation (not
printed on ordinary russian paper) of general rameauâ€™s, telling people
not to leave their homes and that the french authorities would afford
them proper protection. she handed this to the princess.

â€œi think it would be best to appeal to that general,â€ she continued,
â€œand i am sure that all due respect would be shown you.â€

princess mary read the paper, and her face began to quiver with stifled
sobs.

â€œfrom whom did you get this?â€ she ask

ed.

â€œthey probably recognized that i am french, by my name,â€ replied
mademoiselle bourienne blushing.

princess mary, with the paper in her hand, rose from the window and with
a pale face went out of the room and into what had been prince andrewâ€™s
study.

â€œdunyÃ¡sha, send alpÃ¡tych, or drÃ³nushka, or somebody to me!â€ she said,
â€œand tell mademoiselle bourienne not to come to me,â€ she added, hearing
mademoiselle bourienneâ€™s voice. â€œwe must go at once, at once!â€ she said,
appalled at the thought of being left in the hands of the french.

â€œif prince andrew heard that i was in the power of the french! that
i, the daughter of prince nicholas bolkÃ³nski, asked general rameau for
protection and accepted his favor!â€ this idea horrified her, made her
shudder, blush, and feel such a rush of anger and pride as she had never
experienced before. all that was distressing, and especially all that
was humiliating, in

 her position rose vividly to her mind. â€œthey, the
french, would settle in this house: m. le gÃ©nÃ©ral rameau would occupy
prince andrewâ€™s study and amuse himself by looking through and reading
his letters and papers. mademoiselle bourienne would do the honors of
boguchÃ¡rovo for him. i should be given a small room as a favor, the
soldiers would violate my fatherâ€™s newly dug grave to steal his crosses
and stars, they would tell me of their victories over the russians, and
would pretend to sympathize with my sorrow...â€ thought princess mary,
not thinking her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father
and her brother. for herself she did not care where she remained or what
happened to her, but she felt herself the r

have done she felt bound to say and do. she went into prince andrewâ€™s
study, trying to enter completely into his ideas, and considered her
position.

the demands of life, which had seemed to her annihilated by her fatherâ€™s
death, all at once rose before her with a new, previously unknown force
and took possession of her.

agitated and flushed she paced the room, sending now for michael
ivÃ¡novich and now for tÃ­khon or dron. dunyÃ¡sha, the nurse, and the other
maids could not say in how far mademoiselle bourienneâ€™s statement was
correct. alpÃ¡tych was not at home, he had gone to the police. neither
could the architect michael ivÃ¡novich, who on being sent for came in
with sleepy eyes, tell princess mary anything. with just the same smile
of agreement with which for fifteen years he had been accustomed to
answer the old prince without expressing views of his own, he now
replied to princess mary, so that nothing definite could be got from his
answers. the old valet tÃ­khon, with sunken, emaciated face t

nderstand that she could be outwardly so calm and natural.

when rostÃ³v entered the room, the princess dropped her eyes for an
instant, as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt, and then
just as nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look with
shining eyes. with a movement full of dignity and grace she half rose
with a smile of pleasure, held out her slender, delicate hand to him,
and began to speak in a voice in which for the first time new deep
womanly notes vibrated. mademoiselle bourienne, who was in the drawing
room, looked at princess mary in bewildered surprise. herself a
consummate coquette, she could not have maneuvered better on meeting a
man she wished to attract.

â€œeither black is particularly becoming to her or she really has greatly
improved without my having noticed it. and above all, what tact and
grace!â€ thought mademoiselle bourienne.

had princess mary been capable of reflection at that moment, she would
have been more surprised than mademoiselle bourienne at

her brother who was perhaps dying, but
to do everything possible to take his son to him, and so she prepared
to set off. that she had not heard from prince andrew himself, princess
mary attributed to his being too weak to write or to his considering the
long journey too hard and too dangerous for her and his son.

in a few days princess mary was ready to start. her equipages were the
huge family coach in which she had traveled to vorÃ³nezh, a semiopen
trap, and a baggage cart. with her traveled mademoiselle bourienne,
little nicholas and his tutor, her old nurse, three maids, tÃ­khon, and a
young footman and courier her aunt had sent to accompany her.

the usual route through moscow could not be thought of, and the
roundabout way princess mary was obliged to take through lÃ­petsk,
ryazÃ¡n, vladÃ­mir, and shÃºya was very long and, as post horses were not
everywhere obtainable, very difficult, and near ryazÃ¡n where the french
were said to have shown themselves was even dangerous.

ey mademoiselle bourienne, dessalles, and
princess maryâ€™s servants were astonished at her energy and firmness of
spirit. she went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them, and
no difficulties daunted her. thanks to her activity and energy, which
infected her fellow travelers, they approached yaroslÃ¡vl by the end of
the second week.

the last days of her stay in vorÃ³nezh had been the happiest of her life.
her love for rostÃ³v no longer tormented or agitated her. it filled her

as, when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was appalled
by the terrible pallor of the princessâ€™ face that looked out at him from
the window.

â€œi have found out everything, your excellency: the rostÃ³vs are staying
at the merchant brÃ³nnikovâ€™s house, in the square not far from here,
right above the vÃ³lga,â€ said the courier.

princess mary looked at him with frightened inquiry, not understanding
why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know: how was her
brother? mademoiselle bourienne put that question for her.

â€œhow is the prince?â€ she asked.

â€œhis excellency is staying in the same house with them.â€

â€œthen he is alive,â€ thought princess mary, and asked in a low voice:
â€œhow is he?â€

â€œthe servants say he is still the same.â€

what â€œstill the sameâ€ might mean princess mary did not ask, but with an
unnoticed glance at little seven-year-old nicholas, who was sitting in
front of her looking with pleasure at the town, she bowed her head
and did not raise it

id the countess, but as
she spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh, and her gesture conveyed a
contradiction of her words.

â€œwhere is he? can i see himâ€”can i?â€ asked the princess.

â€œone moment, princess, one moment, my dear! is this his son?â€ said the
countess, turning to little nicholas who was coming in with dessalles.
â€œthere will be room for everybody, this is a big house. oh, what a
lovely boy!â€

the countess took princess mary into the drawing room, where sÃ³nya was
talking to mademoiselle bourienne. the countess caressed the boy, and
the old count came in and welcomed the princess. he had changed very
much since princess mary had last seen him. then he had been a brisk,
cheerful, self-assured old man; now he seemed a pitiful, bewildered
person. while talking to princess mary he continually looked round as
if asking everyone whether he was doing the right thing. after the
destruction of moscow and of his property, thrown out of his accustomed
groove he seemed to have lost the sense of his

 herself what distressed her, she had to admit that it was her
relation to rostÃ³v. his cold, polite manner did not express his feeling
for her (she knew that) but it concealed something, and until she could
discover what that something was, she felt that she could not be at
ease.

one day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her
nephewâ€™s lessons, she was informed that rostÃ³v had called. with a firm
resolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation, she sent
for mademoiselle bourienne and went with her to the drawing room.

her first glance at nicholasâ€™ face told her that he had only come to
fulfill the demands of politeness, and she firmly resolved to maintain
the tone in which he addressed her.

they spoke of the countessâ€™ health, of their mutual friends, of the
latest war news, and when the ten minutes required by propriety had
elapsed after which a visitor may rise, nicholas got up to say good-by.

with mademoiselle bourienneâ€™s help the princess had maintained the

conversation very well, but at the very last moment, just when he rose,
she was so tired of talking of what did not interest her, and her
mind was so full of the question why she alone was granted so little
happiness in life, that in a fit of absent-mindedness she sat still, her
luminous eyes gazing fixedly before her, not noticing that he had risen.

nicholas glanced at her and, wishing to appear not to notice her
abstraction, made some remark to mademoiselle bourienne and then
again looked at the princess. she still sat motionless with a look of
suffering on her gentle face. he suddenly felt sorry for her and was
vaguely conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her face
expressed. he wished to help her and say something pleasant, but could
think of nothing to say.

â€œgood-bye, princess!â€ said he.

she started, flushed, and sighed deeply.

â€œoh, i beg your pardon,â€ she said as if waking up. â€œare you going
already, count? well then, good-by!

 oh, but the cushion for the
countess!â€

â€œwait a moment, iâ€™ll fetch it,â€ said mademoiselle bourienne, and she
left the room.

they both sat silent, with an occasional glance at one another.

â€œyes, princess,â€ said nicholas at last with a sad smile, â€œit doesnâ€™t
seem long ago since we first met at boguchÃ¡rovo, but how much water
has flowed since then! in what distress we all seemed to be then, yet
i would give much to bring back that time... but thereâ€™s no bringing it
back.â€

princess mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous ones
as he said this. she seemed to be tryin
