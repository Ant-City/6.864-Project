found an empty pint bottle in one of the happiness rooms . . . of a brand distilled by sinners. that's past
and done, as the brother who slipped has confessed and paid penance sevenfold, even refusing the usual
cash discount-i'm sure he won't backslide. but stop and think, my children- is it worth risking eternal
happiness to save a few pennies on an article of worldly merchandise? always look for that happy, holy
seal-of-approval with bishop digby's smiling face on it. don't let a sinner palm off on you something 'just
as good.' our sponsors support us; they deserve your support. brother art, i'm sorry to have to bring up
such a subject-"
 "that's okay, shepherd! pour it on!"
 "-at a time of such great happiness. but we must never forget that-" jubal reached over and
switched off the speaker circuit.
 "mike, that's not anything you need to see."
 "not?"
 "uh-" jubal thought about it. shucks, the boy was going to have to learn about such

 a man came up behind harshaw, tapped him on the shoulder. "is this where the man from mars
hangs out?"
 "yes," agreed jubal.
 "which one is he? i'm tom boone-senator boone, that is-and i've got a message for him from
supreme bishop digby."
 jubal suppressed his personal feelings and let his cortex go into emergency high speed. "i'm jubal
harshaw, senator-" he signalled mike to stand up and offer to shake hands. "-and this is mr. smith.
mike, this is senator boone."
 "how do you do, senator boone," mike said in perfect dancingschool form. he looked at
boone with interest. he had already had it straightened out for him that "senator" did not mean "old
one" as the words seemed to shape; nevertheless he was interested in seeing jus

he decided that he did not yet grok it.
 "pretty well, thank you, mr. smith. but i won't take up your time; they seem to be about to get
this shindig started. mr. smith, supreme bishop digby sent me to give you a personal invite to attend
services at the archangel foster tabernacle of the new revelation."
 "beg pardon?"
 jubal moved in on it. "senator, as you know, many things here- everything-is new to the man
from mars. but it so happens that mr. smith has already seen one of your church services by
stereovision-"
 "not the same thing."
 "i know. but he expressed great interest in it and asked many questions about it-many of which i
could not answer."
 boone looked keenly at him.

 "you're not one of the faithful?"
 "i must admit that i am not."
 "come along yourself. always hope for a sinner."
 "thank you, i will." (you're right, i will, friend!-for i certainly won't let mike go into your trap
alone!)
 "next sunday then-i'll tell bishop digby."
 "next sunday if possible," jubal corrected. "we might be in jail by then."
 boone grinned. "there's always that, ain't th'r? but send word around to me or the supreme
bishop and you won't stay in long." he looked around the crowded room. "seem to be kind o' short on
chairs in here. not much chance for a plain senator with all those muckamucks elbowing each other."
 "perhaps you would honor us by joining us, senator," jubal answered smoothly, "at this table?"

wonder child would be equally a genius in music, art, and statesmanship-and that she would (with the aid
of hormonal treatments) nurse her child herself. she gave out a statement to the press on the
psychological benefits of natural feeding and permitted, or insisted, that the press take pictures of her to
prove that she was physically endowed for this happy duty-a fact that her usual publicity pictures had
never really left undecided-
 supreme bishop digby denounced her as the harlot of babylon and forbade any fosterite to
accept the commission, either as donor or hostmother. alice douglas was quoted as saying: "while i do
not know miss duchess personally, one cannot help but admire her. her brave example should be an
inspiration to mothers everywhere."

money. but he had not forgotten even momentarily that there were other things he was eager to
grok. jubal had put off senator boone's invitation to mike twice without mentioning it to mike and mike
had not noticed, since his quite different grasp of time made "next sunday" no particular date.

 but the next repetition of the invitation came by mall and was addressed to mike; senator boone
was under pressure from supreme bishop digby to produce the man from mars and boone had sensed
that harshaw was stalling him and might stall indefinitely.
 mike took it to jubal, stood waiting. "well?" jubal growled. "do you want to go, or don't you?
you don't have to attend a fosterite service. we can tell 'em to go to hell."
 so a checker cab with a human driver (harshaw refused to trust his life to an autocab) picked
them up the next sunday morning and delivered mike, jill, and jubal to a public landing fiat just outside
the sacred gro

confound it, the boy was simply going to have to get used to meeting people and talking to them on his
own, without jubal or jill or somebody to feed him his lines.
 boone was showing jill some relics of foster in a glass case on the other side of the room; jubal
covertly watched her evident reluctance with mild amusement while he spread pate de fois gras on toast.
he heard a door click and looked around; digby and mike were missing. "where did they go, senator?"
 "eh? what was that, doctor?"
 "bishop digby and mr. smith. where are they?"
 boone looked around, seemed to notice the closed door. "oh, they've just stepped in there for a
moment. that's a little retiring room used for private audiences. you were in it, weren't you? when the
supreme bishop was showing you around."
 "um, yes." it was a small room with nothing in it but a chair on a dais-a "throne," jubal corrected
himself with a private grin-and a kneeler with an ann rest. jubal wondered which one would use the
throne and which one would

 "what do we do?"
 "beat on it, if you want to. you'll just bruise your hands. i'm going to see what's keeping friend
boone-"
 but when jubal looked out into the hallway he saw boone just returning. "sorry," boone said.
"had to have the cherubim hunt up your driver. he was in the happiness room, having a bite of lunch.
but your cab is waiting for you, just where i said."
 "senator," jubal said, "we've got to leave now. will you be so kind as to tell bishop digby?"
 boone looked perturbed. "i could phone him, if you insist. but i hesitate to do so-and i simply
cannot walk in on a private audience."
 "then phone him. we do insist."

 but boone was saved the embarrassment as, just then, the inner door opened and mike walked
out. jill took one look at his face and shrilled, "mike! are you all right?"
 "yes, jill."
 "i'll tell the supreme bishop you're leaving," said boone and went

 not singling out any of them for condemnation, either; it is
entirely conceivable that some one of these mutually contradictory mythologies is the literal word of god .
. . that god is in truth the sort of bloodthirsty paranoid who would rend to bits forty-two children for the
crime of sassing one of his priests. don't ask me about the front office's policies; i just work here. my
point is that foster's new revelation that you're so contemptuous of is pure sweetness-andlight as
scripture goes. bishop digby's patron is a pretty good joe; he wants people to be happy-happy here on
earth plus guaranteed eternal bliss in heaven. he doesn't expect you to chastise the flesh here and now in
order to reap rewards after you're dead. oh no! this is the modern gianteconomy package. if you like to
drink and gamble and dance and wench- and most people do-come to church and do it under holy
auspices. do it with your conscience free of any trace of guilt. really have fun at it. live it up! get
