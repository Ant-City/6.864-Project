[CHARACTER]
mattie's character constitutes the hinge on which the
plot of ethan frome turns. all of the story's events
are set in motion by her presence in the frome household. yet we
glimpse mattie, as we glimpse zeena, only through ethan's eyes,
and his perception of her is skewed by his passion. with her grace,
beauty, and vitality, she obviously embodies everything that he
feels zeena has denied him, and so becomes the focus of his aborted
rebellion against his unhappy life. mattie is distinguished by little
other than the red decoration she wears, which symbolizes both passion
and transgression.

until the very end, we cannot even be certain that mattie
reciprocates ethan's feelings for her. when, at the climax of the
novel, mattie's true self does shine through, we see her as an impulsive, melodramatic
young woman, more adolescent than adult. her most active deed of
self-definition is persuading ethan to attempt suicide, which reveals
her as rather immature, ready to give in to whatever passionate
(and foolish) thoughts enter her head. yet, because the text has
so strongly established mattie as the horrid zeena's polar opposite,
we forgive her childish delight in melodrama. even in her recklessness,
mattie seems preferable to the shrewish, complaining, curmudgeonly
zeena: it is better that ethan die a quick death with mattie, we
feel, than a slow one with zeena. nevertheless, one cannot help
but suspect that mattie may not be quite worth the passion that
ethan directs her way, and that the rebellion and escape she represents
are more important than the pretty, flighty, and slightly absentminded
girl she actually is.
