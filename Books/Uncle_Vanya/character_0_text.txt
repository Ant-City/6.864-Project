uncle vanya




act i

a country house on a terrace. in front of it a garden. in an avenue of trees, under an old poplar, stands a table set for tea, with a samovar, etc. some benches and chairs stand near the table. on one of them is lying a guitar. a hammock is swung near the table. it is three o'clock in the afternoon of a cloudy day.

marina, a quiet, grey-haired, little old woman, is sitting at the table knitting a stocking.

astroff is walking up and down near her.

marina. [pouring some tea into a g

 all the glory of her beauty and freedom to him. why? what for?

astroff. is she faithful to him?

voitski. yes, unfortunately she is.

astroff. why unfortunately?

voitski. because such fidelity is false and unnatural, root and branch. it sounds well, but there is no logic in it. it is thought immoral for a woman to deceive an old husband whom she hates, but quite moral for her to strangle her poor youth in her breast and banish every vital desire from her heart.

telegin. [in a tearful voice] vanya, i don't like to hear you talk so. listen, vanya; every one who betrays husband or wife is faithless, and could also betray his country.

voitski. [crossly] turn off the tap, waffles.

telegin. no, allow me, vanya. my wife ran away with a lover on the day after our wedding, because my exterior was unprepossessing. i have never failed in my duty since then. i love her and am true to her to this day. i help her all i can and have given my fortune to educate the daughter of herself and her lover.

n illuminating personality, which illuminated no one. [a pause] i had an illuminating personality! you couldn't say anything more biting. i am forty-seven years old. until last year i endeavoured, as you do now, to blind my eyes by your pedantry to the truths of life. but now—oh, if you only knew! if you knew how i lie awake at night, heartsick and angry, to think how stupidly i have wasted my time when i might have been winning from life everything which my old age now forbids.

sonia. uncle vanya, how dreary!

mme. voitskaya. [to her son] you speak as if your former convictions were somehow to blame, but you yourself, not they, were at fault. you have forgotten that a conviction, in itself, is nothing but a dead letter. you should have done something.

voitski. done something! not every man is capable of being a writer perpetuum mobile like your herr professor.

mme. voitskaya. what do you mean by that?

sonia. [imploringly] mother! uncle vanya! i entreat you!

voitski. i am silent. i a

 sonia. i have come to take your place.

serebrakoff. [frightened] no, n-o, no! don't leave me alone with him! oh, don't. he will begin to lecture me.

voitski. but you must give them a little rest. they have not slept for two nights.

serebrakoff. then let them go to bed, but you go away too! thank you. i implore you to go. for the sake of our former friendship do not protest against going. we will talk some other time——

voitski. our former friendship! our former——

sonia. hush, uncle vanya!

serebrakoff. [to his wife] my darling, don't leave me alone with him. he will begin to lecture me.

voitski. this is ridiculous.

marina comes in carrying a candle.

sonia. you must go to bed, nurse, it is late.

marina. i haven't cleared away the tea things. can't go to bed yet.

serebrakoff. no one can go to bed. they are all worn out, only i enjoy perfect happiness.

marina. [goes up to serebrakoff and speaks tenderly] what's the matter, master? does it hurt? my own legs are aching too, oh

at my feet like so many insects or microbes. [to telegin] play, waffles!

telegin. my dear boy, i would with all my heart, but do listen to reason; everybody in the house is asleep.

astroff. play!

telegin plays softly.

astroff. i want a drink. come, we still have some brandy left. and then, as soon as it is day, you will come home with me. [he sees sonia, who comes in at that moment.]

astroff. i beg your pardon, i have no collar on.

[he goes out quickly, followed by telegin.]

sonia. uncle vanya, you and the doctor have been drinking! the good fellows have been getting together! it is all very well for him, he has always done it, but why do you follow his example? it looks dreadfully at your age.

voitski. age has nothing to do with it. when real life is wanting one must create an illusion. it is better than nothing.

sonia. our hay is all cut and rotting in these daily rains, and here you are busy creating illusions! you have given up the farm altogether. i have done all the work alon

 the women have spoiled him. here is some cheese for you.

[they stand eating by the sideboard.]

astroff. i haven't eaten anything to-day. your father has a very difficult nature. [he takes a bottle out of the sideboard] may i? [he pours himself a glass of vodka] we are alone here, and i can speak frankly. do you know, i could not stand living in this house for even a month? this atmosphere would stifle me. there is your father, entirely absorbed in his books, and his gout; there is your uncle vanya with his hypochondria, your grandmother, and finally, your step-mother—

sonia. what about her?

astroff. a human being should be entirely beautiful: the face, the clothes, the mind, the thoughts. your step-mother is, of course, beautiful to look at, but don't you see? she does nothing but sleep and eat and walk and bewitch us, and that is all. she has no responsibilities, everything is done for her—am i not right? and an idle life can never be a pure one. [a pause] however, i may be judgin

g her too severely. like your uncle vanya, i am discontented, and so we are both grumblers.

sonia. aren't you satisfied with life?

astroff. i like life as life, but i hate and despise it in a little russian country village, and as far as my own personal life goes, by heaven! there is absolutely no redeeming feature about it. haven't you noticed if you are riding through a dark wood at night and see a little light shining ahead, how you forget your fatigue and the darkness and the sharp twigs that whip your face? i work, that you know

right. i beg your pardon. [he points to helena] look at her. wandering up and down from sheer idleness. a sweet picture, really.

helena. i wonder you are not bored, droning on in the same key from morning till night. [despairingly] i am dying of this tedium. what shall i do?

sonia. [shrugging her shoulders] there is plenty to do if you would.

helena. for instance?

sonia. you could help run this place, teach the children, care for the sick—isn't that enough? before you and papa came, uncle vanya and i used to go to market ourselves to deal in flour.

helena. i don't know anything about such things, and besides, they don't interest me. it is only in novels that women go out and teach and heal the peasants; how can i suddenly begin to do it?

sonia. how can you live here and not do it? wait awhile, you will get used to it all. [embraces her] don't be sad, dearest. [laughing] you feel miserable and restless, and can't seem to fit into this life, and your restlessness is catching. look at

uncle vanya, he does nothing now but haunt you like a shadow, and i have left my work to-day to come here and talk with you. i am getting lazy, and don't want to go on with it. dr. astroff hardly ever used to come here; it was all we could do to persuade him to visit us once a month, and now he has abandoned his forestry and his practice, and comes every day. you must be a witch.

voitski. why should you languish here? come, my dearest, my beauty, be sensible! the blood of a nixey runs in your veins. oh, w

helena. confess that you would try the patience of an angel.

voitski. as a peace offering i am going to fetch some flowers which i picked for you this morning: some autumn roses, beautiful, sorrowful roses. [he goes out.]

sonia. autumn roses, beautiful, sorrowful roses!

[she and helena stand looking out of the window.]

helena. september already! how shall we live through the long winter here? [a pause] where is the doctor?

sonia. he is writing in uncle vanya's room. i am glad uncle vanya has gone out, i want to talk to you about something.

helena. about what?

sonia. about what?

[she lays her head on helena's breast.]

helena. [stroking her hair] there, there, that will do. don't, sonia.

sonia. i am ugly!

helena. you have lovely hair.

sonia. don't say that! [she turns to look at herself in the glass] no, when a woman is ugly they always say she has beautiful hair or eyes. i have loved him now for six years, i have loved him more than one loves

 him beside me every moment of the day. i feel the pressure of his hand on mine. if i look up, i seem to see him coming, and as you see, i run to you to talk of him. he is here every day now, but he never looks at me, he does not notice my presence. it is agony. i have absolutely no hope, no, no hope. oh, my god! give me strength to endure. i prayed all last night. i often go up to him and speak to him and look into his eyes. my pride is gone. i am not mistress of myself. yesterday i told uncle vanya i couldn't control myself, and all the servants know it. every one knows that i love him.

helena. does he?

sonia. no, he never notices me.

helena. [thoughtfully] he is a strange man. listen, sonia, will you allow me to speak to him? i shall be careful, only hint. [a pause] really, to be in uncertainty all these years! let me do it!

sonia nods an affirmative.

helena. splendid! it will be easy to find out whether he loves you or not. don't be ashamed, sweetheart, don't worry. i shall be care

ss with no one around her except these colourless shadows that go mooning about talking nonsense and knowing nothing except that they eat, drink, and sleep. among them appears from time to time this dr. astroff, so different, so handsome, so interesting, so charming. it is like seeing the moon rise on a dark night. oh, to surrender oneself to his embrace! to lose oneself in his arms! i am a little in love with him myself! yes, i am lonely without him, and when i think of him i smile. that uncle vanya says i have the blood of a nixey in my veins: "give rein to your nature for once in your life!" perhaps it is right that i should. oh, to be free as a bird, to fly away from all your sleepy faces and your talk and forget that you have existed at all! but i am a coward, i am afraid; my conscience torments me. he comes here every day now. i can guess why, and feel guilty already; i should like to fall on my knees at sonia's feet and beg her forgiveness, and weep.

owed me a meagre salary of five hundred roubles a year, a beggar's pittance, and have never even thought of adding a rouble to it.

serebrakoff. what did i know about such things, ivan? i am not a practical man and don't understand them. you might have helped yourself to all you wanted.

voitski. yes, why did i not steal? don't you all despise me for not stealing, when it would have been only justice? and i should not now have been a beggar!

mme. voitskaya. [sternly] jean!

telegin. [agitated] vanya, old man, don't talk in that way. why spoil such pleasant relations? [he embraces him] do stop!

voitski. for twenty-five years i have been sitting here with my mother like a mole in a burrow. our every thought and hope was yours and yours only. by day we talked with pride of you and your work, and spoke your name with veneration; our nights we wasted reading the books and papers which my soul now loathes.

telegin. don't, vanya, don't. i can't stand it.

serebrakoff. [wrathfully] what under he

ame roof with him. his room [he points to the centre door] is almost next door to mine. let him take himself off into the village or into the wing of the house, or i shall leave here at once. i cannot stay in the same house with him.

helena. [to her husband] we are leaving to-day; we must get ready at once for our departure.

serebrakoff. what a perfectly dreadful man!

sonia. [on her knees beside the nurse and turning to her father. she speaks with emotion] you must be kind to us, papa. uncle vanya and i are so unhappy! [controlling her despair] have pity on us. remember how uncle vanya and granny used to copy and translate your books for you every night—every, every night. uncle vanya has toiled without rest; he would never spend a penny on us, we sent it all to you. we have not eaten the bread of idleness. i am not saying this as i should like to, but you must understand us, papa, you must be merciful to us.

helena. [very excited, to her husband] for heaven's sake, alexander, go and

 we are all dependents on god. you and sonia and all of us. every one must work, no one can sit idle. where is sonia?

telegin. in the garden with the doctor, looking for ivan. they fear he may lay violent hands on himself.

marina. where is his pistol?

telegin. [whispers] i hid it in the cellar.

voitski and astroff come in.

voitski. leave me alone! [to marina and telegin] go away! go away and leave me to myself, if but for an hour. i won't have you watching me like this!

telegin. yes, yes, vanya. [he goes out on tiptoe.]

marina. the gander cackles; ho! ho! ho!

[she gathers up her wool and goes out.]

voitski. leave me by myself!

astroff. i would, with the greatest pleasure. i ought to have gone long ago, but i shan't leave you until you have returned what you took from me.

voitski. i took nothing from you.

astroff. i am not jesting, don't detain me, i really must go.

voitski. i took nothing of yours.

astroff. you didn't? very well, i shall have to wait a little longer, and then

 go into the woods and shoot yourself there. give up the morphine, or there will be a lot of talk and guesswork; people will think i gave it to you. i don't fancy having to perform a post-mortem on you. do you think i should find it interesting?

sonia comes in.

voitski. leave me alone.

astroff. [to sonia] sonia, your uncle has stolen a bottle of morphine out of my medicine-case and won't give it up. tell him that his behaviour is—well, unwise. i haven't time, i must be going.

sonia. uncle vanya, did you take the morphine?

astroff. yes, he took it. [a pause] i am absolutely sure.

sonia. give it up! why do you want to frighten us? [tenderly] give it up, uncle vanya! my misfortune is perhaps even greater than yours, but i am not plunged in despair. i endure my sorrow, and shall endure it until my life comes to a natural end. you must endure yours, too. [a pause] give it up! dear, darling uncle vanya. give it up! [she weeps] you are so good, i am sure you will have pity on us and give i

voitski takes a bottle from the drawer of the table and hands it to astroff.

voitski. there it is! [to sonia] and now, we must get to work at once; we must do something, or else i shall not be able to endure it.

sonia. yes, yes, to work! as soon as we have seen them off we shall go to work. [she nervously straightens out the papers on the table] everything is in a muddle!

astroff. [putting the bottle in his case, which he straps together] now i can be off.

helena. are you here, ivan? we are starting in a moment. go to alexander, he wants to speak to you.

sonia. go, uncle vanya. [she takes voitski 's arm] come, you and papa must make peace; that is absolutely necessary.

sonia and voitski go out.

helena. i am going away. [she gives astroff her hand] good-bye.

astroff. so soon?

helena. the carriage is waiting.

astroff. good-bye.

helena. you promised me you would go away yourself to-day.

astroff. i have not forgotten. i am going at once. [a pause] were you frightened? was it so terrible?

helena. yes.

, and yet i am strangely sure that had you stayed here we should have been overtaken by the most immense desolation. i would have gone to my ruin, and you—you would not have prospered. so go! e finita la comedia!

helena. [snatching a pencil off astroff's table, and hiding it with a quick movement] i shall take this pencil for memory!

astroff. how strange it is. we meet, and then suddenly it seems that we must part forever. that is the way in this world. as long as we are alone, before uncle vanya comes in with a bouquet—allow me—to kiss you good-bye—may i? [he kisses her on the cheek] so! splendid!

helena. i wish you every happiness. [she glances about her] for once in my life, i shall! and scorn the consequences! [she kisses him impetuously, and they quickly part] i must go.

astroff. yes, go. if the carriage is there, then start at once. [they stand listening.]

astroff. e finita!

he rummages through his papers on the table. a pause. the tinkling of bells is heard as the horses trot away.

astroff. they have gone! the professor, i suppose, is glad to go. he couldn't be tempted back now by a fortune.

marina comes in.

marina. they have gone. [she sits down in an arm-chair and knits her stocking.]

sonia comes in wiping her eyes.

sonia. they have gone. god be with them. [to her uncle] and now, uncle vanya, let us do something!

voitski. to work! to work!

sonia. it is long, long, since you and i have sat together at this table. [she lights a lamp on the table] no ink! [she takes the inkstand to the cupboard and fills it from an ink-bottle] how sad it is to see them go!

mme. voitskaya comes slowly in.

mme. voitskaya. they have gone.

she sits down and at once becomes absorbed in her book. sonia sits down at the table and looks through an account book.

sonia comes in and sets the candle stick on the table.

sonia sits down and begins to write.

[yawning] oh, ho! the lord have mercy.

telegin comes in on tiptoe, sits down near the door, and begins to tune his guitar.

voitski. [to sonia, stroking her hair] oh, my child, i am miserable; if you only knew how miserable i am!

sonia. what can we do? we must live our lives. [a pause] yes, we shall live, uncle vanya. we shall live through the long procession of days before us, and through the long evenings; we shall patiently bear the trials that fate imposes on us; we shall work for others without rest, both now and when we are old; and when our last hour comes we shall meet it humbly, and there, beyond the grave, we shall say that we have suffered and wept, that our life was bitter, and god will have pity on us. ah, then dear, dear uncle, we shall see that bright and beautiful life; we shall rejoice and

 fervent, passionate faith. [sonia kneels down before her uncle and lays her head on his hands. she speaks in a weary voice] we shall rest. [telegin plays softly on the guitar] we shall rest. we shall hear the angels. we shall see heaven shining like a jewel. we shall see all evil and all our pain sink away in the great compassion that shall enfold the world. our life will be as peaceful and tender and sweet as a caress. i have faith; i have faith. [she wipes away her tears] my poor, poor uncle vanya, you are crying! [weeping] you have never known what happiness was, but wait, uncle vanya, wait! we shall rest. [she embraces him] we shall rest. [the watchman's rattle is heard in the garden; telegin plays softly; mme. voitskaya writes something on the margin of her pamphlet; marina knits her stocking] we shall rest.

the curtain slowly falls.
