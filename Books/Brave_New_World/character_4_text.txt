sight of the stranger, he sprang to his feet and darted forward, his 
hand outstretched, smiling with all his teeth, effusive. 

"controller! what an unexpected pleasure! boys, what are you thinking 
of? this is the controller; this is his fordship, mustapha mond."

"that's why you're taught no history," the controller was saying. "but 
now the time has come ..." 

the d.h.c. looked at him nervously. there were those strange rumours 
of old forbidden books hidden in a safe in the controller's study. bibles, 
poetry-ford knew what. 

mustapha mond intercepted his anxious glance and the corners of his 
red lips twitched ironically. 

"it's all right, director," he said in a tone of faint derision, "i won't cor-

the d.h.c. was overwhelmed with confusion. 

those who feel themselves despised do well to look despising. the 
smile on bernard marx's face was contemptuous. every hair on the

"yes," said mustapha mond, nodding his head, "you may well shudder."

the vibro-vac like a pearl illuminated from within, pinkly glowing. 

"nobody." 

lenina raised her eyebrows in astonishment.

"they say he doesn't like obstacle golf." 

"they say, they say," mocked lenina. 

"and then he spends most of his time by himself-alone." there was 
horror in fanny's voice. 

"well, he won't be alone when he's with me. and anyhow, why are 
people so beastly to him? i think he's rather sweet." she smiled to 
herself; how absurdly shy he had been! frightened almost-as though 
she were a world controller and he a gamma-minus machine minder. 

"consider your own lives," said mustapha mond. "has any of you ever 
encountered an insurmountable obstacle?" 

the question was answered by a negative silence. 

"has any of you been compelled to live through a long time-interval 
between the consciousness of a desire and its fufilment?" 

"well," began one of the boys, and hesitated. 

"speak up," said the d.h.c. "don't keep his fordship waiting."

the director glanced at him sourly. but the stamp of the world con-

tapha mond, bold and black, across the bottom. everything was per- 
fectly in order. the director had no choice. he pencilled his initials-two 
small pale letters abject at the feet of mustapha mond-and was about 
to return the paper without a word of comment or genial ford-speed, 
when his eye was caught by something written in the body of the per- 
mit. 

"for the new mexican reservation?" he said, and his tone, the face he 
lifted to bernard, expressed a kind of agitated astonishment. 

surprised by his surprise, bernard nodded. there was a silence. 

the director leaned back in his chair, frowning. "how long ago was it?" 
he said, speaking more to himself than to bernard. "twenty years

they climbed into the machine and started off at once. at ten thirty- 
four they landed on the roof of the santa fe post office; at ten thirty- 
seven bernard had got through to the world controller's office in 
whitehall; at ten thirty-seven he was speaking to his fordship's fourth 
personal secretary; at ten forty-four he was repeating his story to the 
first secretary, and at ten forty-seven and a half it was the deep, reso-

"yes, i do find it of sufficient scientific interest," said the deep voice. 
"bring these two individuals back to london with you."

impressively. "what do you think of that, mr. savage?" 

john thought it very nice. "still," he said, "ariel could put a girdle

mustapha mond's anger gave place almost at once to mirth. the idea 
of this creature solemnly lecturing him-fr/'m-about the social order was 
really too grotesque. the man must have gone mad. "i ought to give 



him a lesson," he said to himself; then threw back his head and 
laughed aloud. for the moment, at any rate, the lesson would not be 
given.

the book had been published at detroit by the society for the propa-

that the book didn't interest him, when the door opened, and the resi- 
dent world controller for western europe walked briskly into the room. 

mustapha mond shook hands with all three of them; but it was to the 
savage that he addressed himself. "so you don't much like civilization, 
mr. savage," he said. 

the savage looked at him. he had been prepared to lie, to bluster, to 
remain sullenly unresponsive; but, reassured by the good-humoured 
intelligence of the controller's face, he decided to tell the truth, 
straightforwardly. "no." he shook his head. 

bernard started and looked horrified. what would the controller think? 
to be labelled as the

to an abject silence. 

"of course," the savage went on to admit, "there are some very nice 
things. all that music in the air, for instance ..." 

"sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about my ears 
and sometimes voices." 

the savage's face lit up with a sudden pleasure. "have you read it 
too?" he asked. "i thought nobody knew about that book here, in eng- 
land." 

"almost nobody. i'm one of the very few. it's prohibited, you see. but

they're the gyroscope that stabilizes the rocket plane of state on its 
unswerving course." the deep voice thrillingly vibrated; the gesticulat-

mustapha mond's oratory was almost up to synthetic standards.

tively speaking, enormous. we should suffer acutely if we were con- 
fined in a narrower space. you cannot pour upper-caste champagne-

also been proved in actual practice. the result of the cyprus experi- 
ment was convincing." 

"what was that?" asked the savage. 

mustapha mond smiled. "well, you can call it an experiment in rebot- 
tling if you like. it began in a.f. 473. the controllers had the island of 
cyprus cleared of all its existing inhabitants and re-colonized with a 
specially prepared batch of twenty-two thousand alphas. all agricul- 
tural and industrial equipment was handed over to them and they were 
left to manage their own affairs. the result exactly fulfilled all the 
theoretical predictions. the land wasn't properly worked; there were

grade jobs were counter-intriguing at all costs to stay where they 
were. within six years they were having a first-class civil war. when 
nineteen out of the twenty-two thousand had been killed, the survivors 
unanimously petitioned the world controllers to resume the govern- 
ment of the island. which they did. and that was the end of the only 
society of alphas that the world has ever seen." 

the savage sighed, profoundly. 

"the optimum population," said mustapha mond, "is modelled on the 
iceberg-eight-ninths below the water line, one-ninth above." 

"and they're happy below the water line?" 

"happier than above it. happier than your friend here, for example." 
he pointed. 

"in spite of that awful work?" 

"awful? they don't find it so. on the contrary, they like it. it's light, it's 
childishly simple. no strain on the mind or the muscles. seven and a 
half hours of mild, unexhausting labour, and then the soma ration and

wouldn't. the experiment was tried, more than a century and a half

the result? unrest and a large increase in the consumption of soma; 
that was all. those three and a half hours of extra leisure were so far 
from being a source of happiness, that people felt constrained to take 
a holiday from them. the inventions office is stuffed with plans for 
labour-saving processes. thousands of them." mustapha mond made a 
lavish gesture. "and why don't we put them into execution? for the 
sake of the labourers; it would be sheer cruelty to afflict them with ex- 
cessive leisure. it's the same with agriculture. we could synthesize 
every morsel of food, if we wanted to. but we don't. we prefer to keep 
a third of the population on the land. for their own sakes-because it 
takes longer to get food out of the land than out of a factory. besides,

science? the savage frowned. he knew the word. but what it exactly 
signified he could not say. shakespeare and the old men of the pueblo 
had never mentioned science, and from linda he had only gathered 
the vaguest hints: science was something you made helicopters with, 
some thing that caused you to laugh at the corn dances, something 
that prevented you from being wrinkled and losing your teeth. he 
made a desperate effort to take the controller's meaning. 

"yes," mustapha mond was saying, "that's another item in the cost of 
stability. it isn't only art that's incompatible with happiness; it's also 
science. science is dangerous; we have to keep it most carefully 
chained and muzzled." 

"what?" said helmholtz, in astonishment. "but we're always saying 
that science is everything. it's a hypnopaedic platitude." 

"three times a week between thirteen and seventeen," put in bernard. 

"and all the science propaganda we do at the college ..."

he pointed accusingly to helmholtz and the savage. "oh, please don't

other chance. please give me another chance." the tears began to 
flow. "i tell you, it's their fault," he sobbed. "and not to iceland. oh 
please, your fordship, please ..." and in a paroxysm of abjection he 
threw himself on his knees before the controller. mustapha mond tried 
to make him get up; but bernard persisted in his grovelling; the 
stream of words poured out inexhaustibly. in the end the controller 
had to ring for his fourth secretary. 

"bring three men," he ordered, "and take mr. marx into a bedroom. 
give him a good soma vaporization and then put him to bed and leave 
him." 

the fourth secretary went out and returned with three green-

"what difference does that make?"

he said. "a cardinal," he exclaimed parenthetically, "was a kind of 
arch-community-songster." 

'"i pandulph, of fair milan, cardinal.' i've read about them in shake-

they do to the will of another. but as time goes on, they, as all men,

the other, turned over the pages. "take this, for example," he said, 
and in his deep voice once more began to read: "'a man grows old; he 
feels in himself that radical sense of weakness, of listlessness, of dis- 
comfort, which accompanies the advance of age; and, feeling thus, 
imagines himself merely sick, lulling his fears with the notion that this

we have soma? of something immovable, when there is the social or-

"then you think there is no god?" 
"no, i think there quite probably is one."

mustapha mond checked him. "but he manifests himself in different 
ways to different men. in premodern times he manifested himself as

"how does he manifest himself now?" asked the savage. 
"well, he manifests himself as an absence; as though he weren't there 
at all."

thing by instinct! one believes things because one has been condi-

other bad reasons-that's philosophy. people believe in god because 
they've been conditioned to. 

"but all the same," insisted the savage, "it is natural to believe in god 
when you're alone-quite alone, in the night, thinking about death ..." 
"but people never are alone now," said mustapha mond. "we make 
them hate solitude; and we arrange their lives so that it's almost im- 
possible for them ever to have it." 

the savage nodded gloomily. at malpais he had suffered because they 
had shut him out from the communal activities of the pueblo, in civi- 
lized london he was suffering because he could never escape from 
those communal activities, never be quietly alone.

"i'm sure you have," said mustapha mond. "but then we aren't indians.

"but god's the reason for everything noble and fine and heroic. if you

"my dear young friend," said mustapha mond, "civilization has abso-

political inefficiency. in a properly organized society like ours, nobody 
has any opportunities for being noble or heroic. conditions have got to 
be thoroughly unstable before the occasion can arise. where there are

dangerously?" 

"there's a great deal in it," the controller replied. "men and women 
must have their adrenals stimulated from time to time."

from the bathroom came an unpleasant and characteristic sound. 

"is there anything the matter?" helmholtz called. 

there was no answer. the unpleasant sound was repeated, twice; 
there was silence. then, with a click the bathroom door opened and, 
very pale, the savage emerged. 

"i say," helmholtz exclaimed solicitously, "you do look ill, john!"
