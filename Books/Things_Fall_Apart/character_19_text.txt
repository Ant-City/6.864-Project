. nwoye's mother is already cooking."

"go and bring our own, then. we must cook quickly or we shall be
late for the wrestling."

ezinma ran in the direction of the barn and brought back two yams
from the dwarf wall.

ekwefi peeled the yams quickly. the troublesome nanny-goat
sniffed about, eating the peelings. she cut the yams into small
pieces and began to prepare a pottage, using some of the chicken.

at that moment they heard someone crying just outside their
compound. it was very much like obiageli, nwoye's sister.

"is that not obiageli weeping?" ekwefi called across the yard to
nwoye's mother.



"yes," she replied. "she must have broken her waterpot."



the weeping was now quite close and soon the children filed in,
carrying on their heads various sizes of pots suitable to their years.
ikemefuna came first with the biggest pot, closely followed by
nwoye and his two younger brothers. obiageli brought up the rear,
her face streaming with tears. in her hand was the cloth pad on
which th

e pot should have rested on her head.

"what happened?" her mother asked, and obiageli told her
mournful story. her mother consoled her and promised to buy her
her another pot.

nwoye's younger brothers were about to tell their mother the true
story of the accident when ikemefuna looked at them sternly and
they held their peace. the fact was that obiageli had been making
inyanga with her pot. she had balanced it on her head, folded her
arms in front of her and began to sway her waist like a grown-up
young lady. when the pot fell down and broke she burst out
laughing. she only began to weep when they got near the iroko
tree outside their compound.

the drums were still beating, persistent and unchanging. their
sound was no longer a separate thing from the living village. it was
like the pulsation of its heart. it throbbed in the air, in the sunsh

ine,
and even in the trees, and filled the village with excitement.

ekwefi ladled her husband's share of the pottage into a bowl and
covered it. ezinma took it to him in his obi.

okonkwo was sitting on a goatskin already eating his first wife's
meal. obiageli, who had brought it from her mother's hut, sat on
the floor waiting for him to finish. ezinma placed her mother's dish
before him and sat with obiageli.



"sit like a woman!" okonkwo shouted at her. ezinma brought her
two legs together and stretched them in front of her.



"father, will you go to see the wrestling?" ezinma asked after a
suitable interval.

"yes," he answered. "will you go?"

"yes." and after a pause she said: "can i bring your chair for
you?"

"no, that is a boy's job." okonkwo was specially fond of ezinma.
she looked very much like her mother, who was once the village
beauty. but his fondness only showed on very rare occas

ions.

"obiageli broke her pot today," ezinma said.

"yes, she has told me about it," okonkwo said between mouthfuls.

"father," said obiageli, "people should not talk when they are
eating or pepper may go down the wrong way."

"that is very true. do you hear that, ezinma? you are older than
obiageli but she has more sense."

he uncovered his second wife's dish and began to eat from it.
obiageli took the first dish and returned to her mother's hut. and
then nkechi came in, bringing the third dish. nkechi was the
daughter of okonkwo's third wife.

in the distance the drums continued to beat.

the whole village turned out on the ilo, men, women and children.
they stood round in a huge circle leaving the center of the
playground free. the elders and grandees of the village sat on their

left on her farm from the previous
year. neither of the other wives had. it was not that they had been



lazy, but that they had many children to feed. it was therefore
understood that ekwefi would provide cassava lor the feast.
nwoye's mother and ojiugo would provide the  other things like
smoked fish, palm-oil and pepper for the soup. okonkwo would
take care of meat and yams.



ekwefi rose early on the following morning and went to her farm
with her daughter, ezinma, and ojiugo's daughter, obiageli, to
harvest cassava tubers. each of them carried a long cane basket, a
machete for cutting down the soft cassava stem, and a little hoe for
digging out the tuber. fortunately, a light rain had fallen during the
night and the soil would not be very hard.

"it will not take us long to harvest as much as we like," said
ekwefi.

"but the leaves will be wet," said ezinma. her basket was
balanced on her head, and her arms folded across her breasts. she
felt cold. "i dislike cold water dropping on my

back. we should
have waited for the sun to rise and dry the leaves."

obiageli called her "salt" because she said that she disliked water.
"are you afraid you may dissolve?"

the harvesting was easy, as ekwefi had said. ezinma shook every
tree violently with a long stick before she bent down to cut the
stem and dig out the tuber. sometimes it was not necessary to dig.
they just pulled the stump, and earth rose, roots snapped below,
and the tuber was pulled out.

when they had harvested a sizable heap they carried it down in
two trips to the stream, where every woman had a

 shallow well for
fermenting her cassava.

"it should be ready in four days or even three," said obiageli.
"they are young tubers."



"they are not all that young," said ekwefi. "i planted the farm
nearly two years ago. it is a poor soil and that is why the tubers are
so small."



okonkwo never did things by halves. when his wife ekwefi
protested that two goats were sufficient for the feast he told her
that it was not her affair.

"i am calling a feast because i have the wherewithal. i cannot live
on the bank of a river and wash my hands with spittle. my mother's
people have been good to me and

s they lasted, she could bear no other person
but her father.

many young men and prosperous middle-aged men of mbanta
came to marry her. but she refused them all, because her father had
called her one evening and said to her: "there are many good and
prosperous people here, but i shall be happy if you marry in
umuofia when we return home."



that was all he had said. but ezinma had seen clearly all the
thought and hidden meaning behind the few words. and she had
agreed.



"your half-sister, obiageli, will not understand me," okonkwo
said. "but you can explain to her."

although they were almost the same age, ezinma wielded a strong
influence over her half-sister. she explained to her why they
should not marry yet, and she agreed also. and so the two of them
refused every offer of marriage in mbanta.

"i wish she were a boy," okonkwo thought within himself. she
understood things so perfectly. who else among his children could
have read his thoughts so well? with two beautiful grown-up
