  resolv'd on death, resolv'd to die in arms,
  but first to gather friends, with them t' oppose

  with sense of honor and revenge inspir'd.

  "pantheus, apollo's priest, a sacred name,
  had scap'd the grecian swords, and pass'd the flame:
  with relics loaden. to my doors he fled,
  and by the hand his tender grandson led.
  'what hope, o pantheus? whither can we run?
  where make a stand? and what may yet be done?'
  scarce had i said, when pantheus, with a groan:
  'troy is no more, and ilium was a town!
  the fatal day, th' appointed hour, is come,
  when wrathful jove's irrevocable doom
  transfers the trojan state to grecian hands.

  the queen at length appears; on either hand
  the brawny guards in martial order stand.
  a flow'r'd simar with golden fringe she wore,
  and at her back a golden quiver bore;
  her flowing hair a golden caul restrains,
  a golden clasp the tyrian robe sustains.
  then young ascanius, with a sprightly grace,

  but far above the rest in beauty shines
  the great aeneas, the troop he joins;
  like fair apollo, when he leaves the frost
  of wint'ry xanthus, and the lycian coast,
  when to his native delos he resorts,
  ordains the dances, and renews the sports;
  where painted scythians, mix'd with cretan bands,
  before the joyful altars join their hands:
  himself, on cynthus walking, sees below
  the merry madness of the sacred show.

  her staring eyes with sparkling fury roll;
  when all the god came rushing on her soul.
  swiftly she turn'd, and, foaming as she spoke:
  "why this delay?" she cried- "the pow'rs invoke!
  thy pray'rs alone can open this abode;
  else vain are my demands, and dumb the god."

  she said no more. the trembling trojans hear,
  o'erspread with a damp sweat and holy fear.
  the prince himself, with awful dread possess'd,
  his vows to great apollo thus address'd:
  "indulgent god, propitious pow'r to troy,
  swift to relieve, unwilling to destroy,
  directed by whose hand the dardan dart
  pierc'd the proud grecian's only mortal part:
  thus far, by fate's decrees and thy commands,
  thro' ambient seas and thro' devouring sands,
  our exil'd crew has sought th' ausonian ground;
  and now, at length, the flying coast is found.
  thus far the fate of troy, from place to place,
  with fury has pursued her wand'ring race.

  to fix my wand'ring gods, and find a place
  for the long exiles of the trojan race.
  then shall my grateful hands a temple rear
  to the twin gods, with vows and solemn pray'r;
  and annual rites, and festivals, and games,
  shall be perform'd to their auspicious names.
  nor shalt thou want thy honors in my land;
  for there thy faithful oracles shall stand,
  preserv'd in shrines; and ev'ry sacred lay,
  which, by thy mouth, apollo shall convey:
  all shall be treasur'd by a chosen train
  of holy priests, and ever shall remain.
  but o! commit not thy prophetic mind
  to flitting leaves, the sport of ev'ry wind,
  lest they disperse in air our empty fate;
  write not, but, what the pow'rs ordain, relate."

  and lab'ring underneath the pond'rous god,
  the more she strove to shake him from her breast,
  with more and far superior force he press'd;

  now, by my sov'reign, and his fate, i swear,
  renown'd for faith in peace, for force in war;
  oft our alliance other lands desir'd,
  and, what we seek of you, of us requir'd.
  despite not then, that in our hands we bear
  these holy boughs, sue with words of pray'r.
  fate and the gods, by their supreme command,
  have doom'd our ships to seek the latian land.
  to these abodes our fleet apollo sends;
  here dardanus was born, and hither tends;
  where tuscan tiber rolls with rapid force,
  and where numicus opes his holy source.
  besides, our prince presents, with his request,
  some small remains of what his sire possess'd.
  this golden charger, snatch'd from burning troy,
  anchises did in sacrifice employ;
  this royal robe and this tiara wore
  old priam, and this golden scepter bore
  in full assemblies, and in solemn games;
  these purple vests were weav'd by dardan dames."

  conducted to the grove, aeneas broke
  the silence first, and thus the king bespoke:
  "best of the greeks, to whom, by fate's command,
  i bear these peaceful branches in my hand,
  undaunted i approach you, tho' i know
  your birth is grecian, and your land my foe;
  from atreus tho' your ancient lineage came,
  and both the brother kings your kindred claim;
  yet, my self-conscious worth, your high renown,
  your virtue, thro' the neighb'ring nations blown,
  our fathers' mingled blood, apollo's voice,
  have led me hither, less by need than choice.
  our founder dardanus, as fame has sung,
  and greeks acknowledge, from electra sprung:
  electra from the loins of atlas came;
  atlas, whose head sustains the starry frame.
  your sire is mercury, whom long before
  on cold cyllene's top fair maia bore.
  maia the fair, on fame if we rely,
  was atlas' daughter, who sustains the sky.
  thus from one common source our streams divide;
  ours is the trojan, yours th' arcadian side.

  three hundred temples in the town he plac'd;
  with spoils and altars ev'ry temple grac'd.
  three shining nights, and three succeeding days,
  the fields resound with shouts, the streets with praise,
  the domes with songs, the theaters with plays.
  all altars flame: before each altar lies,
  drench'd in his gore, the destin'd sacrifice.
  great caesar sits sublime upon his throne,
  before apollo's porch of parian stone;
  accepts the presents vow'd for victory,
  and hangs the monumental crowns on high.
  vast crowds of vanquish'd nations march along,
  various in arms, in habit, and in tongue.

  and thunder'd on the left, amidst the clear.

  the feather'd death, and hisses thro' the skies.
  the steel thro' both his temples forc'd the way:
  extended on the ground, numanus lay.
  "go now, vain boaster, and true valor scorn!
  the phrygians, twice subdued, yet make this third return."
  ascanius said no more. the trojans shake
  the heav'ns with shouting, and new vigor take.

  apollo then bestrode a golden cloud,
  to view the feats of arms, and fighting crowd;
  and thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud:
  "advance, illustrious youth, increase in fame,
  and wide from east to west extend thy name;
  offspring of gods thyself; and rome shall owe
  to thee a race of demigods below.
  this is the way to heav'n: the pow'rs divine

  their arms, their numbers, and their names declare.

  borne in the tiger thro' the foaming sea;
  from asium brought, and cosa, by his care:
  for arms, light quivers, bows and shafts, they bear.
  fierce abas next: his men bright armor wore;
  his stern apollo's golden statue bore.
  six hundred populonia sent along,
  all skill'd in martial exercise, and strong.
  three hundred more for battle ilva joins,
  an isle renown'd for steel, and unexhausted mines.
  asylas on his prow the third appears,
  who heav'n interprets, and the wand'ring stars;
  from offer'd entrails prodigies expounds,
  and peals of thunder, with presaging sounds.
  a thousand spears in warlike order stand,

  he said. the hero sternly thus replied:
  "thy bars and ingots, and the sums beside,
  leave for thy children's lot. thy turnus broke
  all rules of war by one relentless stroke,
  when pallas fell: so deems, nor deems alone
  my father's shadow, but my living son."
  thus having said, of kind remorse bereft,
  he seiz'd his helm, and dragg'd him with his left;
  then with his right hand, while his neck he wreath'd,
  up to the hilts his shining fauchion sheath'd.

  apollo's priest, emonides, was near;
  his holy fillets on his front appear;
  glitt'ring in arms, he shone amidst the crowd;
  much of his god, more of his purple, proud.
  him the fierce trojan follow'd thro' the field:
  the holy coward fell; and, forc'd to yield,
  the prince stood o'er the priest, and, at one blow,
  sent him an off'ring to the shades below.
  his arms seresthus on his shoulders bears,
  design'd a trophy to the god of wars.

  the stains of this dishonorable day:
  nor spoils, nor triumph, from the fact i claim,
  but with my future actions trust my fame.

  apollo heard, and, granting half his pray'r,
  shuffled in winds the rest, and toss'd in empty air.
  he gives the death desir'd; his safe return
  by southern tempests to the seas is borne.

  his limbs from earth, supported on his spear.
  resolv'd in mind, regardless of the smart,
  he tugs with both his hands, and breaks the dart.
  the steel remains. no readier way he found
  to draw the weapon, than t' inlarge the wound.
  eager of fight, impatient of delay,
  he begs; and his unwilling friends obey.

  iapis was at hand to prove his art,
  whose blooming youth so fir'd apollo's heart,
  that, for his love, he proffer'd to bestow
  his tuneful harp and his unerring bow.
  the pious youth, more studious how to save
  his aged sire, now sinking to the grave,
  preferr'd the pow'r of plants, and silent praise
  of healing arts, before phoebean bays.

  peaceful menoetes after these he kill'd,
  who long had shunn'd the dangers of the field:
  on lerna's lake a silent life he led,
  and with his nets and angle earn'd his bread;
  nor pompous cares, nor palaces, he knew,
  but wisely from th' infectious world withdrew:

  discharg'd his rent, and plow'd another's land.
