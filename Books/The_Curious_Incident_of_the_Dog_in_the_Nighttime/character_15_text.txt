ing to the other people in our street was brave. but if you are going to do detective work you have 
to be brave, so i had no choice. 
 
first of all i made a plan of our part of the street, which is called randolph street, like this 
 

 
 
then i made sure i had my swiss army knife in my pocket and i went out and i knocked on the door of 
number 40, which is opposite mrs. shears's house, which means that they were most likely to have seen 
something. the people who live at number 40 are called thompson. 

 

mr. thompson answered the door. he was wearing a t-shirt which said  

beer  

helping ugly people have sex  
for 2,000 years 

mr. thompson said, "can i help you?" 

i said, "do you know who killed wellington?" 

i did not look at his face. i do not like looking at people's faces, especially if they are strangers. he did 
not say anything for a few seconds. 

then he said, "who are you?" 

i said, "i'm christopher boone from number 36 and i know you. you're mr. thompson." 

he said, "i'

m mr. thompson's brother." 

i said, "do you know who killed wellington?"

because i heard him walking back up the garden again. 
 
then i stayed still and i looked at my watch and i stayed still for 27 minutes. and then i heard father start 
the engine of his van. i knew it was his van because i heard it very often and it was nearby and i knew it 
wasn't any of the neighbors' cars because the people who take drugs have a volkswagen camper van and 
mr. thompson, who lives at number 40, has a vauxhall cavalier and the people who live at number 34 
have a peugeot and they all sound different. 
 
and when i heard him drive away from the house i knew it would be safe to come out.
