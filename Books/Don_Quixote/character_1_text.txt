with very little wit in his pate. in a word, he so talked him over, and
with such persuasions and promises, that the poor clown made up his mind
to sally forth with him and serve him as esquire. don quixote, among
other things, told him he ought to be ready to go with him gladly,
because any moment an adventure might occur that might win an island in
the twinkling of an eye and leave him governor of it. on these and the
like promises sancho panza (for so the labourer was called) left wife and
children, and engaged himself as esquire to his neighbour.

don quixote next set about getting some money; and selling one thing and
pawning another, and making a bad bargain in every case, he got together
a fair sum. he provided himself with a buckler, which he begged as a loan
from a friend, and, restoring his battered helmet as best he could, he
warned his squire sancho of the day and hour he meant to set out, that he

l to mind any knight-errant taking with him an
esquire mounted on ass-back, but no instance occurred to his memory. for
all that, however, he determined to take him, intending to furnish him
with a more honourable mount when a chance of it presented itself, by
appropriating the horse of the first discourteous knight he encountered.
himself he provided with shirts and such other things as he could,
according to the advice the host had given him; all which being done,
without taking leave, sancho panza of his wife and children, or don
quixote of his housekeeper and niece, they sallied forth unseen by
anybody from the village one night, and made such good way in the course
of it that by daylight they held themselves safe from discovery, even
should search be made for them.

sancho rode on his ass like a patriarch, with his alforjas and bota, and
longing to see himself soon governor of the island his master had
promised him. don quixote decided upon taking the same route and road he

travelled with less discomfort than on the last occasion, for, as it was
early morning and the rays of the sun fell on them obliquely, the heat
did not distress them.

and now said sancho panza to his master, "your worship will take care,
senor knight-errant, not to forget about the island you have promised me,
for be it ever so big i'll be equal to governing it."

to which don quixote replied, "thou must know, friend sancho panza, that
it was a practice very much in vogue with the knights-errant of old to
make their squires governors of the islands or kingdoms they won, and i
am determined that there shall be no failure on my part in so liberal a

may well be that before six days are over, i may have won some kingdom
that has others dependent upon it, which will be just the thing to enable
thee to be crowned king of one of them. nor needst thou count this
wonderful, for things and chances fall to the lot of such knights in ways
so unexampled and unexpected that i might easily give thee even more than
i promise thee."

"in that case," said sancho panza, "if i should become a king by one of
those miracles your worship speaks of, even juana gutierrez, my old
woman, would come to be queen and my children infantes."

"well, who doubts it?" said don quixote.

"i doubt it," replied sancho panza, "because for my part i am persuaded
that though god should shower down kingdoms upon earth, not one of them
would fit the head of mari gutierrez. let me tell you, senor, she is not
worth two maravedis for a queen; countess will fit her better, and

of the good fortune which the valiant don quixote had in the terrible and
undreamt-of adventure of the windmills, with other occurrences worthy to
be fitly recorded


at this point they came in sight of thirty forty windmills that there are
on plain, and as soon as don quixote saw them he said to his squire,
"fortune is arranging matters for us better than we could have shaped our
desires ourselves, for look there, friend sancho panza, where thirty or
more monstrous giants present themselves, all of whom i mean to engage in
battle and slay, and with whose spoils we shall begin to make our
fortunes; for this is righteous warfare, and it is god's good service to
sweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth."

"what giants?" said sancho panza.

"those thou seest there," answered his master, "with the long arms, and
some have them nearly two leagues long."

"look, your worship," said sancho; "what we see there

"hush, friend sancho," replied don quixote, "the fortunes of war more
than any other are liable to frequent fluctuations; and moreover i think,
and it is the truth, that that same sage friston who carried off my study
and books, has turned these giants into mills in order to rob me of the
glory of vanquishing them, such is the enmity he bears me; but in the end
his wicked arts will avail but little against my good sword."

"god order it as he may," said sancho panza, and helping him to rise got
him up again on rocinante, whose shoulder was half out; and then,
discussing the late adventure, they followed the road to puerto lapice,
for there, said don quixote, they could not fail to find adventures in
abundance and variety, as it was a great thoroughfare. for all that, he
was much grieved at the loss of his lance, and saying so to his squire,
he added, "i remember having read how a spanish knight, diego perez de

dangerous they might be. finally they passed the night among some trees,
from one of which don quixote plucked a dry branch to serve him after a
fashion as a lance, and fixed on it the head he had removed from the
broken one. all that night don quixote lay awake thinking of his lady
dulcinea, in order to conform to what he had read in his books, how many
a night in the forests and deserts knights used to lie sleepless
supported by the memory of their mistresses. not so did sancho panza
spend it, for having his stomach full of something stronger than chicory
water he made but one sleep of it, and, if his master had not called him,
neither the rays of the sun beating on his face nor all the cheery notes
of the birds welcoming the approach of day would have had power to waken
him. on getting up he tried the bota and found it somewhat less full than
the night before, which grieved his heart because they did not seem to be
on the way to remedy the deficiency readily. don qu

they returned to the road they had set out with, leading to puerto
lapice, and at three in the afternoon they came in sight of it. "here,
brother sancho panza," said don quixote when he saw it, "we may plunge
our hands up to the elbows in what they call adventures; but observe,
even shouldst thou see me in the greatest danger in the world, thou must
not put a hand to thy sword in my defence, unless indeed thou perceivest
that those who assail me are rabble or base folk; for in that case thou
mayest very properly aid me; but if they be knights it is on no account

or i know you, lying rabble," said don quixote,
and without waiting for a reply he spurred rocinante and with levelled
lance charged the first friar with such fury and determination, that, if
the friar had not flung himself off the mule, he would have brought him
to the ground against his will, and sore wounded, if not killed outright.
the second brother, seeing how his comrade was treated, drove his heels
into his castle of a mule and made off across the country faster than the
wind.

sancho panza, when he saw the friar on the ground, dismounting briskly
from his ass, rushed towards him and began to strip off his gown. at that
instant the friars muleteers came up and asked what he was stripping him
for. sancho answered them that this fell to him lawfully as spoil of the
battle which his lord don quixote had won. the muleteers, who had no idea
of a joke and did not understand all this about battles and spoils,

could be seen to be a hired one a bowshot off. the biscayan had an
inscription under his feet which said, "don sancho de azpeitia," which no
doubt must have been his name; and at the feet of rocinante was another
that said, "don quixote." rocinante was marvellously portrayed, so long
and thin, so lank and lean, with so much backbone and so far gone in
consumption, that he showed plainly with what judgment and propriety the
name of rocinante had been bestowed upon him. near him was sancho panza
holding the halter of his ass, at whose feet was another label that said,
"sancho zancas," and according to the picture, he must have had a big
belly, a short body, and long shanks, for which reason, no doubt, the
names of panza and zancas were given him, for by these two surnames the
history several times calls him. some other trifling particulars might be
mentioned, but they are all of slight importance and have nothing to do
with the true relation of the history; and no history can be

the terrified and disconsolate ladies, without discussing don quixote's
demand or asking who dulcinea might be, promised that their squire should
do all that had been commanded.

"then, on the faith of that promise," said don quixote, "i shall do him
no further harm, though he well deserves it of me."

now by this time sancho had risen, rather the worse for the handling of
the friars' muleteers, and stood watching the battle of his master, don
quixote, and praying to god in his heart that it might be his will to
grant him the victory, and that he might thereby win some island to make
him governor of, as he had promised. seeing, therefore, that the struggle
was now over, and that his master was returning to mount rocinante, he
approached to hold the stirrup for him, and, before he c

said; what i beg of your worship is to dress your wound, for a great deal
of blood flows from that ear, and i have here some lint and a little
white ointment in the alforjas."

"all that might be well dispensed with," said don quixote, "if i had
remembered to make a vial of the balsam of fierabras, for time and
medicine are saved by one single drop."

"what vial and what balsam is that?" said sancho panza.

"it is a balsam," answered don quixote, "the receipt of which i have in
my memory, with which one need have no fear of death, or dread dying of
any wound; and so when i make it and give it to thee thou hast nothing to
do when in some battle thou seest they have cut me in half through the
middle of the body--as is wont to happen frequently,--but neatly and with
great nicety, ere the blood congeal, to place that portion of the body

pleasure you have given me by relating so interesting a tale."

"oh," said the goatherd, "i do not know even the half of what has
happened to the lovers of marcela, but perhaps to-morrow we may fall in
with some shepherd on the road who can tell us; and now it will be well
for you to go and sleep under cover, for the night air may hurt your
wound, though with the remedy i have applied to you there is no fear of
an untoward result."

sancho panza, who was wishing the goatherd's loquacity at the devil, on
his part begged his master to go into pedro's hut to sleep. he did so,
and passed all the rest of the night in thinking of his lady dulcinea, in
imitation of the lovers of marcela. sancho panza settled himself between
rocinante and his ass, and slept, not like a lover who had been
discarded, but like a man who had been soundly kicked.

two adventurers a sorry sight and in sorrier mood.

sancho was the first to come to, and finding himself close to his master
he called to him in a weak and doleful voice, "senor don quixote, ah,
senor don quixote!"

"what wouldst thou, brother sancho?" answered don quixote in the same
feeble suffering tone as sancho.

"i would like, if it were possible," answered sancho panza, "your worship
to give me a couple of sups of that potion of the fiery blas, if it be
that you have any to hand there; perhaps it will serve for broken bones
as well as for wounds."

"if i only had it here, wretch that i am, what more should we want?" said
don quixote; "but i swear to thee, sancho panza, on the faith of a
knight-errant, ere two days are over, unless fortune orders otherwise, i
mean to have it in my possession, or my hand will have lost its cunning."

to put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed knights like
myself, and so i believe that in punishment for having transgressed the
laws of chivalry the god of battles has permitted this chastisement to be
administered to me; for which reason, brother sancho, it is well thou

don quixote was in some places, remarked that this had more the look of
blows than of a fall.

it was not blows, sancho said, but that the rock had many points and
projections, and that each of them had left its mark. "pray, senora," he
added, "manage to save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to
use it, for my loins too are rather sore."

"then you must have fallen too," said the hostess.

"i did not fall," said sancho panza, "but from the shock i got at seeing
my master fall, my body aches so that i feel as if i had had a thousand
thwacks."

"that may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened
to me to dream that i was falling down from a tower and never coming to
the ground, and when i awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and
shaken as if i had really fallen."

"there is the point, senora," replied sancho panza, "that i without

"how is the gentleman called?" asked maritornes the asturian.

"don quixote of la mancha," answered sancho panza, "and he is a
knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen
in the world this long time past."

"what is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass.

"are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered sancho panza.
"well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing
that in two words is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most
miserable and needy being in the world, and to-morrow will have two or
three crowns of kingdoms to give his squire."

"then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master
as this, you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a

the mighty crash of this the innkeeper awoke and at once concluded that

he got no answer. with this suspicion he got up, and lighting a lamp
hastened to the quarter where he had heard the disturbance. the wench,
seeing that her master was coming and knowing that his temper was
terrible, frightened and panic-stricken made for the bed of sancho panza,
who still slept, and crouching upon it made a ball of herself.

the innkeeper came in exclaiming, "where art thou, strumpet? of course
this is some of thy work." at this sancho awoke, and feeling this mass
almost on top of him fancied he had the nightmare and began to distribute
fisticuffs all round, of which a certain share fell upon maritornes, who,
irritated by the pain and flinging modesty aside, paid back so many in
return to sancho that she woke him up in spite of himself. he the

profuse sweat, on account of which he bade them cover him up and leave
him alone. they did so, and he lay sleeping more than three hours, at the
end of which he awoke and felt very great bodily relief and so much ease
from his bruises that he thought himself quite cured, and verily believed
he had hit upon the balsam of fierabras; and that with this remedy he
might thenceforward, without any fear, face any kind of destruction,
battle, or combat, however perilous it might be.

sancho panza, who also regarded the amendment of his master as
miraculous, begged him to give him what was left in the pigskin, which
was no small quantity. don quixote consented, and he, taking it with both
hands, in good faith and with a better will, gulped down and drained off
very little less than his master. but the fact is, that the stomach of
poor sancho was of necessity not so delicate as that of his master, and
so, before vomiting, he was seized with such gripings and retchings, and

ulders. it is true that the innkeeper detained
his alforjas in payment of what was owing to him, but sancho took his
departure in such a flurry that he never missed them. the innkeeper, as
soon as he saw him off, wanted to bar the gate close, but the blanketers
would not agree to it, for they were fellows who would not have cared two

to the conclusion, good sancho, that this castle or inn is beyond a doubt
enchanted, because those who have so atrociously diverted themselves with
thee, what can they be but phantoms or beings of another world? and i
hold this confirmed by having noticed that when i was

their herds along the spreading pastures of the winding guadiana famed
for its hidden course, those that tremble with the cold of the pineclad
pyrenees or the dazzling snows of the lofty apennine; in a word, as many
as all europe includes and contains."

good god! what a number of countries and nations he named! giving to each
its proper attributes with marvellous readiness; brimful and saturated
with what he had read in his lying books! sancho panza hung upon his
words without speaking, and from time to time turned to try if he could
see the knights and giants his master was describing, and as he could not
make out one of them he said to him:

"senor, devil take it if there's a sign of any man you talk of, knight or
giant, in the whole thing; maybe it's all enchantment, like the phantoms
last night."

"how canst thou say that!" answered don quixote; "dost thou not hear the
neighing of the steeds, the braying of the trumpets, the

sancho perceiving it his master's final resolve, and how little his
tears, counsels, and entreaties prevailed with him, determined to have
recourse to his own ingenuity and compel him, if he could, to wait till
daylight; and so, while tightening the girths of the horse, he quietly
and without being felt, with his ass' halter tied both rocinante's legs,
so that when don quixote strove to go he was unable as the horse could
only move by jumps. seeing the success of his trick, sancho panza said:

"see there, senor! heaven, moved by my tears and prayers, has so ordered
it that rocinante cannot stir; and if you will be obstinate, and spur and
strike him, you will only provoke fortune, and kick, as they say, against
the pricks."

don quixote at this grew desperate, but the more he drove his heels into
the horse, the less he stirred him; and not having any suspicion of the
tying, he was fain to resign himself and wait till daybreak or until
rocinante could move, firmly pers

ing home he had made his
will, in which he would find himself fully recompensed in the matter of
wages in due proportion to the time he had served; but if god delivered
him safe, sound, and unhurt out of that danger, he might look upon the
promised island as much more than certain. sancho began to weep afresh on
again hearing the affecting words of his good master, and resolved to
stay with him until the final issue and end of the business. from these
tears and this honourable resolve of sancho panza's the author of this
history infers that he must have been of good birth and at least an old
christian; and the feeling he displayed touched his but not so much as to
make him show any weakness; on the contrary, hiding what he felt as well
as he could, he began to move towards that quarter whence the sound of
the water and of the strokes seemed to come.

his ass, his constant comrade in prosperity or adversity; and a

most grave, high-sounding, minute, delightful, and original history that
after the discussion between the famous don quixote of la mancha and his
squire sancho panza which is set down at the end of chapter twenty-one,
don quixote raised his eyes and saw coming along the road he was
following some dozen men on foot strung together by the neck, like beads,
on a great iron chain, and all with manacles on their hands. with them
there came also two men on horseback and two on foot; those on horseback
with wheel-lock muskets, those on foot with javelins and swords, and as
soon as sancho saw them he said:

don quixote passed on to the fourth, a man of venerable aspect with a

reason of his being there began to weep without answering a word, but the
fifth acted as his tongue and said, "this worthy man is going to the
galleys for four years, after having gone the rounds in ceremony and on
horseback."

"that means," said sancho panza, "as i take it, to have been exposed to
shame in public."

"just so," replied the galley slave, "and the offence for which they gave
him that punishment was having been an ear-broker, nay body-broker; i
mean, in short, that this gentleman goes as a pimp, and for having
besides a certain touch of the sorcerer about him."

madness of don quixote had been released from the chain, driven by fear
of the holy brotherhood, which he had good reason to dread, resolved to
take hiding in the mountains; and his fate and fear led him to the same
spot to which don quixote and sancho panza had been led by theirs, just
in time to recognise them and leave them to fall asleep: and as the
wicked are always ungrateful, and necessity leads to evildoing, and
immediate advantage overcomes all considerations of the future, gines,
who was neither grateful nor well-principled, made up his mind to steal
sancho panza's ass, not troubling himself about rocinante, as being a
prize that was no good either to pledge or sell. while sancho slept he
stole his ass, and before day dawned he was

sancho panza, for he found that his dapple was missing, and seeing
himself bereft of him he began the saddest and most doleful lament in the
world, so loud that don quixote awoke at his exclamations and heard him
saying, "o son of my bowels, born in my very house, my children's
plaything, my wife's joy, the envy of my neighbours, relief of my
burdens, and lastly, half supporter of myself, for with the

earnest his veritable born lady; to such a pass had his unholy books
brought him. cardenio, then, being, as i said, now mad, when he heard
himself given the lie, and called a scoundrel and other insulting names,
not relishing the jest, snatched up a stone that he found near him, and
with it delivered such a blow on don quixote's breast that he laid him on
his back. sancho panza, seeing his master treated in this fashion,
attacked the madman with his closed fist; but the ragged one received him
in such a way that with a blow of his fist he stretched him at his feet,
and then mounting upon him crushed his ribs to his own satisfaction; the
goatherd, who came to the rescue, shared the same fate; and having beaten
and pummelled them all he left them and quietly withdrew to his
hiding-place on the mountain. sancho rose, and with the rage he felt at

"everything is needed for the calling i follow," said don quixote.

"now then," said sancho, "let your worship put the order for the three
ass-colts on the other side, and sign it very plainly, that they may
recognise it at first sight."

"with all my heart," said don quixote, and as he had written it he read
it to this effect:

"mistress niece,--by this first of ass-colts please pay to sancho panza,
my squire, three of the five i left at home in your charge: said three
ass-colts to be paid and delivered for the same number received here in
hand, which upon this and upon his receipt shall be duly paid. done in
the heart of the sierra morena, the twenty-seventh of august of this
present year."

"that will do," said sancho; "now let your worship sign it."

"there is no need to sign it," said don quixote, "but merely to put my
flourish, which is the same as a signature, and enough f

highest of these rocks to see if i can discover thee returning; however,
not to miss me and lose thyself, the best plan will be to cut some
branches of the broom that is so abundant about here, and as thou goest
to lay them at intervals until thou hast come out upon the plain; these
will serve thee, after the fashion of the clue in the labyrinth of
theseus, as marks and signs for finding me on thy return."

"so i will," said sancho panza, and having cut some, he asked his
master's blessing, and not without many tears on both sides, took his
leave of him, and mounting rocinante, of whom don quixote charged him
earnestly to have as much care as of his own person, he set out for the
plain, strewing at intervals the branches of broom as his master had
recommended him; and so he went his way, though don quixote still
entreated him to see him do were it only a couple of mad acts. he had not

 and satyrs of the woods and the nymphs of the streams, and
echo, moist and mournful, to answer, console, and hear him, as well as in
looking for herbs to sustain him, he passed his time until sancho's
return; and had that been delayed three weeks, as it was three days, the
knight of the rueful countenance would have worn such an altered
countenance that the mother that bore him would not have known him: and
here it will be well to leave him, wrapped up in sighs and verses, to
relate how sancho panza fared on his mission.

as for him, coming out upon the high road, he made for el toboso, and the
next day reached the inn where the mishap of the blanket had befallen
him. as soon as he recognised it he felt as if he were once more living
through the air, and he could not bring himself to enter it though it was
an hour when he might well have done so, for it was dinner-time, and he
longed to taste something hot as it had been all cold fare with him for
many days past. this craving drove

 him to draw near to the inn, still
undecided whether to go in or not, and as he was hesitating there came
out two persons who at once recognised him, and said one to the other:

"senor licentiate, is not he on the horse there sancho panza who, our
adventurer's housekeeper told us, went off with her master as esquire?"

"so it is," said the licentiate, "and that is our friend don quixote's
horse;" and if they knew him so well it was because they were the curate
and the barber of his own village, the same who had carried out the
scrutiny and sentence upon the books; and as soon as they recognised
sancho panza and rocinante, being anxious to hear of don quixote, they
approached, and calling him by his name the curate said,

e," said sancho, "for i am not a man
to rob or murder anybody; let his own fate, or god who made him, kill
each one; my master is engaged very much to his taste doing penance in
the midst of these mountains;" and then, offhand and without stopping, he
told them how he had left him, what adventures had befallen him, and how
he was carrying a letter to the lady dulcinea del toboso, the daughter of
lorenzo corchuelo, with whom he was over head and ears in love. they were
both amazed at what sancho panza told them; for though they were aware of
don quixote's madness and the nature of it, each time they heard of it
they were filled with fresh wonder. they then asked sancho panza to show
them the letter he was carrying to the lady dulcinea del toboso. he said
it was written in a note-book, and that his master's directions were that
he should have it copied on paper at the first village he came to. on
this the curate said if he showed it to him, he himself would make a fair
copy of it. sanc

en his master was found he
would get him to renew the order, and make a fresh draft on paper, as was
usual and customary; for those made in notebooks were never accepted or
honoured.

sancho comforted himself with this, and said if that were so the loss of
dulcinea's letter did not trouble him much, for he had it almost by
heart, and it could be taken down from him wherever and whenever they
liked.

"repeat it then, sancho," said the barber, "and we will write it down
afterwards."

sancho panza stopped to scratch his head to bring back the letter to his
memory, and balanced himself now on one foot, now the other, one moment
staring at the ground, the next at the sky, and after having half gnawed
off the end of a finger and kept them in suspense waiting for him to
begin, he said, after a long pause, "by god, senor licentiate, devil a
thing can i recollect of the letter; but it said at the beginning,
'exalted and scrubbing lady.'"

"it cannot have said 'scrubbing,'" said the bar

ed, and, altering their plan, the curate went on to
instruct him how to play his part and what to say to don quixote to
induce and compel him to come with them and give up his fancy for the
place he had chosen for his idle penance. the barber told him he could
manage it properly without any instruction, and as he did not care to
dress himself up until they were near where don quixote was, he folded up
the garments, and the curate adjusted his beard, and they set out under
the guidance of sancho panza, who went along telling them of the
encounter with the madman they met in the sierra, saying nothing,
however, about the finding of the valise and its contents; for with all
his simplicity the lad was a trifle covetous.

the next day they reached the place where sancho had laid the
broom-branches as marks to direct him to where he had left his master,
and recognising it he told them that here was the entrance, and that they
would do well to dress themselves, if that was required to deli

might be of use to them. he also explained to them in a few words the
object that had brought them there, and the strange nature of don
quixote's madness, and how they were waiting for his squire, who had gone
in search of him. like the recollection of a dream, the quarrel he had
had with don quixote came back to cardenio's memory, and he described it
to the others; but he was unable to say what the dispute was about.

at this moment they heard a shout, and recognised it as coming from
sancho panza, who, not finding them where he had left them, was calling
aloud to them. they went to meet him, and in answer to their inquiries
about don quixote, he told them how he had found him stripped to his
shirt, lank, yellow, half dead with hunger, and sighing for his lady
dulcinea; and although he had told him that she commanded him to quit
that place and come to el toboso, where she was expecting him, he had
answered that he was determined not to appear in the presence of her
beauty until he

necklace and other ornaments out of a little box, and with these in an
instant she so arrayed herself that she looked like a great and rich
lady. all this, and more, she said, she had taken from home in case of
need, but that until then she had had no occasion to make use of it. they
were all highly delighted with her grace, air, and beauty, and declared
don fernando to be a man of very little taste when he rejected such
charms. but the one who admired her most was sancho panza, for it seemed
to him (what indeed was true) that in all the days of his life he had
never seen such a lovely creature; and he asked the curate with great
eagerness who this beautiful lady was, and what she wanted in these
out-of-the-way quarters.

"this fair lady, brother sancho," replied the curate, "is no less a
personage than the heiress in the direct male line of the great kingdom
of micomicon, who has come in search of your master to beg a boon of him,
which is that he redress a

wrong or injury that a wicked giant has done
her; and from the fame as a good knight which your master has acquired
far and wide, this princess has come from guinea to seek him."

"a lucky seeking and a lucky finding!" said sancho panza at this;
"especially if my master has the good fortune to redress that injury, and
right that wrong, and kill that son of a bitch of a giant your worship
speaks of; as kill him he will if he meets him, unless, indeed, he
happens to be a phantom; for my master has no power at all against
phantoms. but one thing among others i would beg of you, senor
licentiate, which is, that, to prevent my master taking a fancy to be an
archbishop, for that is what i'm afraid of, your worship would recom

to anything further concerning you, until you rise from the
earth."

"i will not rise, senor," answered the afflicted damsel, "unless of your
courtesy the boon i ask is first granted me."

"i grant and accord it," said don quixote, "provided without detriment or
prejudice to my king, my country, or her who holds the key of my heart
and freedom, it may be complied with."

"it will not be to the detriment or prejudice of any of them, my worthy
lord," said the afflicted damsel; and here sancho panza drew close to his
master's ear and said to him very softly, "your worship may very safely
grant the boon she asks; it's nothing at all; only to kill a big giant;
and she who asks it is the exalted princess micomicona, queen of the
great kingdom of micomicon of ethiopia."

"let her be who she may," replied don quixote, "i will do what is my
bounden duty, and what my conscience bids me, in conformity with what i
have professed;" and turning to the damsel he said, "let your great
beauty r

must be good for more than beards.

"and so it is," said the curate, and he promised to teach it to him on
the first opportunity. they then agreed that for the present the curate
should mount, and that the three should ride by turns until they reached
the inn, which might be about six leagues from where they were.

three then being mounted, that is to say, don quixote, the princess, and
the curate, and three on foot, cardenio, the barber, and sancho panza,
don quixote said to the damsel:

"let your highness, lady, lead on whithersoever is most pleasing to you;"
but before she could answer the licentiate said:

"towards what kingdom would your ladyship direct our course? is it
perchance towards that of micomicon? it must be, or else i know little
about kingdoms."

she, being ready on all points, understood that she was to answer "yes,"
so she said "yes, senor, my way lies towards that kingdom."

"in that case," said the curate, "we m

and lies like a whoreson villain, and this i will give him to know to the
fullest extent with my sword;" and so saying he settled himself in his
stirrups and pressed down his morion; for the barber's basin, which
according to him was mambrino's helmet, he carried hanging at the
saddle-bow until he could repair the damage done to it by the galley
slaves.

dorothea, who was shrewd and sprightly, and by this time thoroughly
understood don quixote's crazy turn, and that all except sancho panza
were making game of him, not to be behind the rest said to him, on
observing his irritation, "sir knight, remember the boon you have
promised me, and that in accordance with it you must not engage in any
other adventure, be it ever so pressing; calm yourself, for if the
licentiate had known that the galley slaves had been set free by that
unconquered arm he would have stopped his mouth thrice over, or even
bitten his tongue three times before he would have said a word that

something belonging to your worship."

"say no more on that subject for thy life, sancho," said don quixote,
"for it is displeasing to me; i have already pardoned thee for that, and
thou knowest the common saying, 'for a fresh sin a fresh penance.'"

while this was going on they saw coming along the road they were
following a man mounted on an ass, who when he came close seemed to be a
gipsy; but sancho panza, whose eyes and heart were there wherever he saw
asses, no sooner beheld the man than he knew him to be gines de
pasamonte; and by the thread of the gipsy he got at the ball, his ass,
for it was, in fact, dapple that carried pasamonte, who to escape
recognition and to sell the ass had disguised himself as a gipsy, being
able to speak the gipsy language, and many more, as well as if they were
his own. sancho saw him and recognised him, and the instant he did so he
shouted to him, "ginesil

'sovereign lady,' and the end 'yours till death, the knight of the rueful

daughter, and maritornes, when they saw don quixote and sancho coming,
went out to welcome them with signs of hearty satisfaction, which don
quixote received with dignity and gravity, and bade them make up a better

living god he has given the giant, the enemy of my lady the princess

who could have helped laughing at the absurdities of the pair, master and
man? and laugh they did, all except the landlord, who cursed himself; but
at length the barber, cardenio, and the curate contrived with no small
trouble to get don quixote on the bed, and he fell asleep with every
appearance of excessive weariness. they left him to sleep, and came out
to the gate of the inn to console sancho panza on not having found the
head of the giant; but much more work had they to appease the landlord,
who was furious at the sudden death of his wine-skins; and said the
landlady half scolding, half crying, "at an evil moment and in an unlucky
hour he came into my house, this knight-errant--would that i had never

all the time dorothea was speaking, cardenio, though he held luscinda in
his arms, never took his eyes off don fernando, determined, if he saw him
make any hostile movement, to try and defend himself and resist as best
he could all who might assail him, though it should cost him his life.
but now don fernando's friends, as well as the curate and the barber, who
had been present all the while, not forgetting the worthy sancho panza,
ran forward and gathered round don fernando, entreating him to have
regard for the tears of dorothea, and not suffer her reasonable hopes to
be disappointed, since, as they firmly believed, what she said was but
the truth; and bidding him observe that it was not, as it might seem, by
accident, but by a special disposition of providence that they had all
met in a place where no one could have expected a meeting. and the curate
bade him remember that only death could part luscinda from ca

once more embraced her and pressed his face to hers with so much
tenderness that he had to take great heed to keep his tears from
completing the proof of his love and repentance in the sight of all. not
so luscinda, and cardenio, and almost all the others, for they shed so
many tears, some in their own happiness, some at that of the others, that
one would have supposed a heavy calamity had fallen upon them all. even
sancho panza was weeping; though afterwards he said he only wept because
he saw that dorothea was not as he fancied the queen micomicona, of whom
he expected such great favours. their wonder as well as their weeping
lasted some time, and then cardenio and luscinda went and fell on their
knees before don fernando, returning him thanks for the favour he had
rendered them in language so grateful that he knew not how to answer
them, and raising them up embraced them with every mark of affection and

the captive's good fortune; and as now almost two-thirds of the night
were past, they resolved to retire to rest for the remainder of it. don
quixote offered to mount guard over the castle lest they should be
attacked by some giant or other malevolent scoundrel, covetous of the
great treasure of beauty the castle contained. those who understood him
returned him thanks for this service, and they gave the judge an account
of his extraordinary humour, with which he was not a little amused.
sancho panza alone was fuming at the lateness of the hour for retiring to
rest; and he of all was the one that made himself most comfortable, as he
stretched himself on the trappings of his ass, which, as will be told
farther on, cost him so dear.

the ladies, then, having retired to their chamber, and the others having
disposed themselves with as little discomfort as they could, don quixote
sallied out of the inn to act as sentinel of the castle as he had
promised. it happened, however, that a litt

"i should like to see that tried," said don quixote; "but he had better

maritornes felt sure that don quixote would present the hand she had
asked, and making up her mind what to do, she got down from the hole and
went into the stable, where she took the halter of sancho panza's ass,
and in all haste returned to the hole, just as don quixote had planted
himself standing on rocinante's saddle in order to reach the grated
window where he supposed the lovelorn damsel to be; and giving her his
hand, he said, "lady, take this hand, or rather this scourge of the
evil-doers of the earth; take, i say, this hand which no other hand of
woman has ever touched, not even hers who has complete possession of my

the guests had by this time made peace with the landlord, for, by
persuasion and don quixote's fair words more than by threats, they had
paid him what he demanded, and the servants of don luis were waiting for
the end of the conversation with the judge and their master's decision,
when the devil, who never sleeps, contrived that the barber, from whom
don quixote had taken mambrino's helmet, and sancho panza the trappings
of his ass in exchange for those of his own, should at this instant enter
the inn; which said barber, as he led his ass to the stable, observed
sancho panza engaged in repairing something or other belonging to the
pack-saddle; and the moment he saw it he knew it, and made bold to attack
sancho, exclaiming, "ho, sir thief, i have caught you! hand over my basin
and my pack-saddle, and all my trappings that you robbed me of."

"for all that," said the curate, "you must not take him away this time,
nor will he, it is my opinion, let himself be taken away."

in short, the curate used such arguments, and don quixote did such mad
things, that the officers would have been more mad than he was if they
had not perceived his want of wits, and so they thought it best to allow
themselves to be pacified, and even to act as peacemakers between the
barber and sancho panza, who still continued their altercation with much
bitterness. in the end they, as officers of justice, settled the question
by arbitration in such a manner that both sides were, if not perfectly
contented, at least to some extent satisfied; for they changed the
pack-saddles, but not the girths or head-stalls; and as to mambrino's
helmet, the curate, under the rose and without don quixote's knowing it,
paid eight reals for the basin, and the barber executed a full receipt

this would be so too, as they were both probably by the same author; so
he kept it, intending to read it when he had an opportunity. he then
mounted and his friend the barber did the same, both masked, so as not to
be recognised by don quixote, and set out following in the rear of the
cart. the order of march was this: first went the cart with the owner
leading it; at each side of it marched the officers of the brotherhood,
as has been said, with their muskets; then followed sancho panza on his
ass, leading rocinante by the bridle; and behind all came the curate and
the barber on their mighty mules, with faces covered, as aforesaid, and a
grave and serious air, measuring their pace to suit the slow steps of the
oxen. don quixote was seated in the cage, with his hands tied and his
feet stretched out, leaning against the bars as silent and as patient as
if he were a stone statue and not a man of flesh. thus slowly and
silently they made, it might be, two leagues, until the

when the canon heard both the prisoner and the man who was at liberty
talk in such a strain he was ready to cross himself in his astonishment,
and could not make out what had befallen him; and all his attendants were
in the same state of amazement.

at this point sancho panza, who had drawn near to hear the conversation,
said, in order to make everything plain, "well, sirs, you may like or
dislike what i am going to say, but the fact of the matter is, my master,
don quixote, is just as much enchanted as my mother. he is in his full
senses, he eats and he drinks, and he has his calls like other men and as
he had yesterday, before they caged him. and if that's the case, what do
they mean by wanting me to believe that he is enchanted? for i have heard

"is it possible," said sancho, "that your worship does not understand
'going anywhere'? why, the schoolboys know that from the time they were
babes. well then, you must know i mean have you had any desire to do what
cannot be avoided?"

"ah! now i understand thee, sancho," said don quixote; "yes, often, and
even this minute; get me out of this strait, or all will not go right."

which treats of the shrewd conversation which sancho panza held with his
master don quixote


"aha, i have caught you," said sancho; "this is what in my heart and soul
i was longing to know. come now, senor, can you deny what is commonly
said around us, when a person is out of humour, 'i don't know what ails
so-and-so, that he neither eats, nor drinks, nor sleeps, nor gives a
proper answer to any question; one would think he was enchanted'? from
which it is to be gathered that those who do not eat, or drink, or sleep,

to the administration of justice, and here capacity and sound judgment
come in, and above all a firm determination to find out the truth; for if
this be wanting in the beginning, the middle and the end will always go
wrong; and god as commonly aids the honest intentions of the simple as he
frustrates the evil designs of the crafty."

"i don't understand those philosophies," returned sancho panza; "all i
know is i would i had the county as soon as i shall know how to govern
it; for i have as much soul as another, and as much body as anyone, and i
shall be as much king of my realm as any other of his; and being so i
should do as i liked, and doing as i liked i should please myself, and
pleasing myself i should be content, and when one is content he has
nothing more to desire, and when one has nothing more to desire there is
an end of it; so let the county come, and god be with you

, and let us see
one another, as one blind man said to the other."

"that is not bad philosophy thou art talking, sancho," said the canon;
"but for all that there is a good deal to be said on this matter of
counties."

to which don quixote returned, "i know not what more there is to be said;
i only guide myself by the example set me by the great amadis of gaul,
when he made his squire count of the insula firme; and so, without any
scruples of conscience, i can make a count of sancho panza, for he is one
of the best squires that ever knight-errant had."

the canon was astonished at the methodical nonsense (if nonsense be
capable of method) that don quixote uttered, at the way in which he had
described the adventure of the knight of the lake, at the impression that
the deliberate lies of the books he read had made upon him, and lastly he
marvelled at the simplicity of sancho, who desired so eagerly to obtain
the county his master had promised him.

him and sent it full in the goatherd's face, with such force that he
flattened his nose; but the goatherd, who did not understand jokes, and
found himself roughly handled in such good earnest, paying no respect to
carpet, tablecloth, or diners, sprang upon don quixote, and seizing him
by the throat with both hands would no doubt have throttled him, had not
sancho panza that instant come to the rescue, and grasping him by the
shoulders flung him down on the table, smashing plates, breaking glasses,
and upsetting and scattering everything on it. don quixote, finding
himself free, strove to get on top of the goatherd, who, with his face
covered with blood, and soundly kicked by sancho, was on all fours
feeling about for one of the table-knives to take a bloody revenge with.
the canon and the curate, however, prevented him, but the barber so

ne of those who supported it, leaving the burden to his
comrades, advanced to meet him, flourishing a forked stick that he had
for propping up the stand when resting, and with this he caught a mighty
cut don quixote made at him that severed it in two; but with the portion
that remained in his hand he dealt such a thwack on the shoulder of don
quixote's sword arm (which the buckler could not protect against the
clownish assault) that poor don quixote came to the ground in a sad
plight.

sancho panza, who was coming on close behind puffing and blowing, seeing
him fall, cried out to his assailant not to strike him again, for he was
a poor enchanted knight, who had never harmed anyone all the days of his
life; but what checked the clown was, not sancho's shouting, but seeing
that don quixote did not stir hand or foot; and so, fancying he had
killed him, he hastily hitched up his tunic under his girdle and took to
his heels across the country like a deer.

expected, for all sancho did was to fling himself on his
master's body, raising over him the most doleful and laughable
lamentation that ever was heard, for he believed he was dead. the curate
was known to another curate who walked in the procession, and their
recognition of one another set at rest the apprehensions of both parties;
the first then told the other in two words who don quixote was, and he
and the whole troop of penitents went to see if the poor gentleman was
dead, and heard sancho panza saying, with tears in his eyes, "oh flower
of chivalry, that with one blow of a stick hast ended the course of thy
well-spent life! oh pride of thy race, honour and glory of all la mancha,
nay, of all the world, that for want of thee will be full of evil-doers,
no longer in fear of punishment for their misdeeds! oh thou, generous

hast given me the best island the sea girds or surrounds! humble with the

 will do with all my heart, senor," said sancho; "and let us
return to our village with these gentlemen, who seek your good, and there
we will prepare for making another sally, which may turn out more
profitable and creditable to us."

"thou art right, sancho," returned don quixote; "it will be wise to let
the malign influence of the stars which now prevails pass off."

the canon, the curate, and the barber told him he would act very wisely
in doing as he said; and so, highly amused at sancho panza's
simplicities, they placed don quixote in the cart as before. the
procession once more formed itself in order and proceeded on its road;
the goatherd took his leave of the party; the officers of the brotherhood
declined to go any farther, and the curate paid them what was due to
them; the canon begged the curate to let him know how don quixote did,
whether he was cured of his madness or still suffered from it, and then
begged leave to continue his journey; in short, they all separated a

went their ways, leaving to themselves the curate and the barber, don
quixote, sancho panza, and the good rocinante, who regarded everything
with as great resignation as his master. the carter yoked his oxen and
made don quixote comfortable on a truss of hay, and at his usual
deliberate pace took the road the curate directed, and at the end of six
days they reached don quixote's village, and entered it about the middle
of the day, which it so happened was a sunday, and the people were all in
the plaza, through which don quixote's cart passed. they all flocked to

were filled with amazement, and a boy ran off to bring the news to his
housekeeper and his niece that their master and uncle had come back all
lean and yellow and stretched on a truss of hay on an ox-cart. it was
piteous to hear the cries the two good ladies raised, how they beat their
breasts and poured out fresh maledictions on those accursed books of
chivalry; all which was renewed when they saw don quixote coming in at
the gate.

at the news of don quixote's arrival sancho panza's wife came running,
for she by this time knew that her husband had gone away with him as his
squire, and on seeing sancho, the first thing she asked him was if the
ass was well. sancho replied that he was, better than his master was.

"thanks be to god," said she, "for being so good to me; but now tell me,
my friend, what have you made by your squirings? what gown have you
brought me back? what shoes for your children?"

"i bring nothing of that sort, wife," said sancho; "though i bri

castles, putting up at inns, all at free quarters, and devil take the
maravedi to pay."

while this conversation passed between sancho panza and his wife, don
quixote's housekeeper and niece took him in and undressed him and laid
him in his old bed. he eyed them askance, and could not make out where he
was. the curate charged his niece to be very careful to make her uncle
comfortable and to keep a watch over him lest he should make his escape
from them again, telling her what they had been obliged to do to bring
him home. on this the pair once more lifted up their voices and renewed
their maledictions upon the books of chival

sancho, who was striving to force his way in to see don quixote while
they held the door against him, "what does the vagabond want in this

ow all about the
calumnies they bring against you, i will fetch you one this instant who
can tell you the whole of them without missing an atom; for last night
the son of bartholomew carrasco, who has been studying at salamanca, came
home after having been made a bachelor, and when i went to welcome him,
he told me that your worship's history is already abroad in books, with
the title of the ingenious gentleman don quixote of la mancha; and he
says they mention me in it by my own name of sancho panza, and the lady
dulcinea del toboso too, and divers things that happened to us when we
were alone; so that i crossed myself in my wonder how the historian who
wrote them down could have known them."

"i promise thee, sancho," said don quixote, "the author of our history
will be some sage enchanter; for to such nothing that they choose to
write about is hidden."

"what!" said sancho, "a sage and an enchanter! why, the bachelor samson
carrasco (that is the name of him i spoke of) says the

another word or waiting for a reply he made off home.

don quixote begged and entreated the bachelor to stay and do penance with
him. the bachelor accepted the invitation and remained, a couple of young
pigeons were added to the ordinary fare, at dinner they talked chivalry,
carrasco fell in with his host's humour, the banquet came to an end, they
took their afternoon sleep, sancho returned, and their conversation was

reply that the same night we went into the sierra morena, flying from the

praiseworthy and valiant purpose. carrasco promised all, and then took

speaks in a style unlike that which might have been expected from his
limited intelligence, and says things so subtle that he does not think it
possible he could have conceived them; however, desirous of doing what
his task imposed upon him, he was unwilling to leave it un

sancho consoled her by saying that though he must make her a countess, he
would put it off as long as possible. here their conversation came to an
end, and sancho went back to see don quixote, and make arrangements for
their departure.

of what took place between don quixote and his niece and housekeeper; one
of the most important chapters in the whole history


while sancho panza and his wife, teresa cascajo, held the above
irrelevant conversation, don quixote's niece and housekeeper were not
idle, for by a thousand signs they began to perceive that their uncle and
master meant to give them the slip the third time, and once more betake
himself to his, for them, ill-errant chivalry. they strove by all the
means in their power to divert him from such an unlucky scheme; but it
was all preaching in the desert and hammering cold iron. nevertheless,

"i can tell you, niece," replied don quixote, "if these chivalrous
thoughts did not engage all my faculties, there would be nothing that i
could not do, nor any sort of knickknack that would not come from my
hands, particularly cages and tooth-picks."

at this moment there came a knocking at the door, and when they asked who
was there, sancho panza made answer that it was he. the instant the
housekeeper knew who it was, she ran to hide herself so as not to see
him; in such abhorrence did she hold him. the niece let him in, and his
master don quixote came forward to receive him with open arms, and the
pair shut themselves up in his room, where they had another conversation
not inferior to the previous one.

"i see nothing, sancho," said don quixote, "but three country girls on

"now, may god deliver me from the devil!" said sancho, "and can it be
that your worship takes three hackneys--or whatever they're called-as
white as the driven snow, for jackasses? by the lord, i could tear my
beard if that was the case!"

"well, i can only say, sancho, my friend," said don quixote, "that it is
as plain they are jackasses--or jennyasses--as that i am don quixote, and
thou sancho panza: at any rate, they seem to me to be so."

"hush, senor," said sancho, "don't talk that way, but open your eyes, and
come and pay your respects to the lady of your thoughts, who is close
upon us now;" and with these words he advanced to receive the three
village lasses, and dismounting from dapple, caught hold of one of the
asses of the three country girls by the halter, and dropping on both
knees on the ground, he said, "queen and princess and duchess of beauty,

rueful countenance.'"

don quixote had by this time placed himself on his knees beside sancho,
and, with eyes starting out of his head and a puzzled gaze, was regarding
her whom sancho called queen and lady; and as he could see nothing in her
except a village lass, and not a very well-favoured one, for she was
platter-faced and snub-nosed, he was perplexed and bewildered, and did

sancho; "and that by this plan we shall find out what we want to know;
and if it be that it is only from your worship she is hidden, the
misfortune will be more yours than hers; but so long as the lady dulcinea

well as we can, seeking our adventures, and leaving time to take his own
course; for he is the best physician for these and greater ailments."

don quixote was about to reply to sancho panza, but he was prevented by a
cart crossing the road full of the most diverse and strange personages
and figures that could be imagined. he who led the mules and acted as
carter was a hideous demon; the cart was open to the sky, without a tilt
or cane roof, and the first figure that presented itself to don quixote's
eyes was that of death itself with a human face; next to it was an angel
with large painted wings, and at one side an emperor, with a crown, to

"how! not vanquished?" said he of the grove; "by the heaven that is above
us i fought don quixote and overcame him and made him yield; and he is a
man of tall stature, gaunt features, long, lank limbs, with hair turning
grey, an aquiline nose rather hooked, and large black drooping
moustaches; he does battle under the name of 'the countenance,' and he
has for squire a peasant called sancho panza; he presses the loins and
rules the reins of a famous steed called rocinante; and lastly, he has
for the mistress of his will a certain dulcinea del toboso, once upon a

seemed to shed and shower down a pearly spray, the willows distilled
sweet manna, the fountains laughed, the brooks babbled, the woods

coming. but hardly had the light of day made it possible to see and
distinguish things, when the first object that presented itself to the
eyes of sancho panza was the squire of the grove's nose, which was so big
that it almost overshadowed his whole body. it is, in fact, stated, that
it was of enormous size, hooked in the middle, covered with warts, and of
a mulberry colour like an egg-plant; it hung down two fingers' length
below his mouth, and the size, the colour, the warts, and the bend of it,
made his face so hideous, that sancho, as he looked at him, began to
tremble hand and foot like a child in convulsions, and he vowed in his
heart to

putting his hand into his right pocket, he pulled out a masquerade nose

examining him more and more closely, exclaimed aloud in a voice of
amazement, "holy mary be good to me! isn't it tom cecial, my neighbour
and gossip?"

"why, to be sure i am!" returned the now unnosed squire; "tom cecial i
am, gossip and friend sancho panza; and i'll tell you presently the means
and tricks and falsehoods by which i have been brought here; but in the
meantime, beg and entreat of your master not to touch, maltreat, wound,
or slay the knight of the mirrors whom he has at his feet; because,
beyond all dispute, it is the rash and ill-advised bachelor samson
carrasco, our fellow townsman."

at this moment he of the mirrors came to himself, and don quixote
perceiving it, held the naked point of his sword over his face, and said

don diego and his son commended his laudable resolution, and bade him
furnish himself with all he wanted from their house and belongings, as
they would most gladly be of service to him; which, indeed, his personal
worth and his honourable profession made incumbent upon them.

the day of his departure came at length, as welcome to don quixote as it
was sad and sorrowful to sancho panza, who was very well satisfied with
the abundance of don diego's house, and objected to return to the
starvation of the woods and wilds and the short-commons of his
ill-stocked alforjas; these, however, he filled and packed with what he
considered needful. on taking leave, don quixote said to don lorenzo, "i

more, that if you wish to spare yourself fatigue and toil in reaching the
inaccessible summit of the temple of f

don quixote asked one of the nymphs who it was that had composed and
arranged it. she replied that it was a beneficiary of the town who had a
nice taste in devising things of the sort. "i will lay a wager," said don
quixote, "that the same bachelor or beneficiary is a greater friend of
camacho's than of basilio's, and that he is better at satire than at
vespers; he has introduced the accomplishments of basilio and the riches
of camacho very neatly into the dance." sancho panza, who was listening
to all this, exclaimed, "the king is my cock; i stick to camacho." "it is
easy to see thou art a clown, sancho," said don quixote, "and one of that
sort that cry 'long life to the conqueror.'"

"i don't know of what sort i am," returned sancho, "but i know very well
i'll never get such elegant skimmings off basilio's pots as these i have
got off camacho's;" and he showed him the bucketful of geese and hens,
and seizing one began to eat with great gaiety and appetite,

"tie me and hold thy peace," said don quixote, "for an emprise like this,
friend sancho, was reserved for me;" and said the guide, "i beg of you,
senor don quixote, to observe carefully and examine with a hundred eyes
everything that is within there; perhaps there may be some things for me
to put into my book of 'transformations.'"

"the drum is in hands that will know how to beat it well enough," said
sancho panza.

when he had said this and finished the tying (which was not over the
armour but only over the doublet) don quixote observed, "it was careless
of us not to have provided ourselves with a small cattle-bell to be tied
on the rope close to me, the sound of which would show that i was still
descending and alive; but as that is out of the question now, in god's
hand be it to guide me;" and forthwith he fell on his knees and in a low
voice offered up a prayer to heaven, imploring god to aid

this life pass away like a shadow and a dream, or fade like the flower of
the field. o ill-fated montesinos! o sore-wounded durandarte! o unhappy
belerma! o tearful guadiana, and ye o hapless daughters of ruidera who
show in your waves the tears that flowed from your beauteous eyes!"

the cousin and sancho panza listened with deep attention to the words of
don quixote, who uttered them as though with immense pain he drew them up
from his very bowels. they begged of him to explain himself, and tell
them what he had seen in that hell down there.

"hell do you call it?" said don quixote; "call it by no such name, for it
does not deserve it, as ye shall soon see."

he then begged them to give him something to eat, as he was very hungry.
they spread the cousin's sackcloth on the grass, and put the

 them, and he told me he did not, but he
thought they must be some enchanted ladies of distinction, for it was
only a few days before that they had made their appearance in those
meadows; but i was not to be surprised at that, because there were a
great many other ladies there of times past and present, enchanted in
various strange shapes, and among them he had recognised queen guinevere
and her dame quintanona, she who poured out the wine for lancelot when he
came from britain."

when sancho panza heard his master say this he was ready to take leave of
his senses, or die with laughter; for, as he knew the real truth about
the pretended enchantment of dulcinea, in which he himself had been the
enchanter and concocter of all the evidence, he made up his mind at last
that, beyond all doubt, his master was out of his wits and stark mad, so
he said to him, "it was an evil hour, a worse season, and a sorrowful
day, when your worship, dear master mine, went down to the other world,

"don't wait for that," said don quixote; "i'll help you in everything,"
and so he did, sifting the barley for him and cleaning out the manger; a
degree of humility which made the other feel bound to tell him with a
good grace what he had asked; so seating himself on a bench, with don
quixote beside him, and the cousin, the page, sancho panza, and the
landlord, for a senate and an audience, he began his story in this way:

"you must know that in a village four leagues and a half from this inn,
it so happened that one of the regidors, by the tricks and roguery of a
servant girl of his (it's too long a tale to tell), lost an ass; and
though he did all he possibly could to find it, it was all to no purpose.
a fortnight might have gone by, so the story goes, since the ass had been
missing, when, as the regidor who had lost it wa

don quixote was thunderstruck, sancho astounded, the cousin staggered,
the page astonished, the man from the braying town agape, the landlord in
perplexity, and, in short, everyone amazed at the words of the
puppet-showman, who went on to say, "and thou, worthy sancho panza, the
best squire and squire to the best knight in the world! be of good cheer,
for thy good wife teresa is well, and she is at this moment hackling a
pound of flax; and more by token she has at her left hand a jug with a
broken spout that holds a good drop of wine, with which she solaces
herself at her work."

"that i can well believe," said sancho. "she is a lucky one, and if it
was not for her jealousy i would not change her for the giantess
andandona, who by my master's account was

e of this, don quixote did not leave off
discharging a continuous rain of cuts, slashes, downstrokes, and
backstrokes, and at length, in less than the space of two credos, he
brought the whole show to the ground, with all its fittings and figures
shivered and knocked to pieces, king marsilio badly wounded, and the
emperor charlemagne with his crown and head split in two. the whole
audience was thrown into confusion, the ape fled to the roof of the inn,
the cousin was frightened, and even sancho panza himself was in mighty
fear, for, as he swore after the storm was over, he had never seen his
master in such a furious passion.

the complete destruction of the show being thus accomplished, don quixote
became a little calmer, said, "i wish i had here before me now all those
who do not or will not believe how useful knights-errant are in the
world; just think, if i had not been here present, what would have become
of the brave don gaiferos and the fair melisendra! depend upon it, by

deeds; but whose generous intentions have been found wanting in my case

rueful figure he must be to have disfigured mine."

sancho panza was touched by master pedro's words, and said to him, "don't
weep and lament, master pedro; you break my heart; let me tell you my
master, don quixote, is so catholic and scrupulous a christian that, if
he can make out that he has done you any wrong, he will own it, and be
willing to pay for it and make it good, and something over and above."

"only let senor don quixote pay me for some part of the work he has
destroyed," said master pedro, "and i would be content, and his worship

costs for this error of mine, though it did not proceed from malice; let
master pedro see what he wants for the spoiled figures, for i agree to

master pedro made him a bow, saying, "i expected no less of the rare
christianity of the valiant don quixote of la mancha, true helper and
protector of all destitute and needy vagabonds; master landlord here and
the great sancho panza shall be the arbitrators and appraisers between
your worship and me of what these dilapidated figures are worth or may be
worth."

the landlord and sancho consented, and then master pedro picked up from
the ground king marsilio of saragossa with his head off, and said, "here
you see how impossible it is to restore this king to his former state, so
i think, saving your better judgments, that for his death, decease, and

says, then, that he who has read the first part of this history will
remember well enough the gines de pasamonte whom, with other galley

he afterwards got poor thanks and worse payment from that evil-minded,
ill-conditioned set. this gines de pasamonte--don ginesillo de parapilla,
don quixote called him--it was that stole dapple from sancho panza;
which, because by the fault of the printers neither the how nor the when
was stated in the first part, has been a puzzle to a good many people,
who attribute to the bad memory of the author what was the error of the
press. in fact, however, gines stole him while sancho panza was asleep on
his back, adopting the plan and device that brunello had recourse to when
he stole sacripante's horse from between his legs at the siege of
albracca; and, as has been told, sancho afterwards recovered

came to where the fair huntress was standing, and dismounting knelt
before her and said, "fair lady, that knight that you see there, the
knight of the lions by name, is my master, and i am a squire of his, and
at home they call me sancho panza. this same knight of the lions, who was
called not long since the knight of the rueful countenance, sends by me
to say may it please your highness to give him leave that, with your
permission, approbation, and consent, he may come and carry out his
wishes, which are, as he says and i believe, to serve your exalted
loftiness and beauty; and if you give it, your ladyship will do a thing
which will redound to your honour, and he will receive a most

to which don quixote replied, "senora, my misfortunes, though they had a
beginning, will never have an end. i have vanquished giants and i have
sent her caitiffs and miscreants; but where are they to find her if she
is enchanted and turned into the most ill-favoured peasant wench that can
be imagined?"

"i don't know," said sancho panza; "to me she seems the fairest creature
in the world; at any rate, in nimbleness and jumping she won't give in to
a tumbler; by my faith, senora duchess, she leaps from the ground on to
the back of an ass like a cat."

"have you seen her enchanted, sancho?" asked the duke.

"what, seen her!" said sancho; "why, who the devil was it but myself that
first thought of the enchantment business? she is as much enchanted as my
father."

"good, by god!" cried sancho; "say no more in your own defence, master
mine, for there's nothing more in the world to be said, thought, or
insisted on; and besides, when this gentleman denies, as he has, that
there are or ever have been any knights-errant in the world, is it any
wonder if he knows nothing of what he has been talking about?"

"perhaps, brother," said the ecclesiastic, "you are that sancho panza
that is mentioned, to whom your master has promised an island?"

"yes, i am," said sancho, "and what's more, i am one who deserves it as

thou wilt be one of them,' and of those, 'not with whom thou art bred,

as the saying is; henceforth i
will believe myself, and i will take care that everyone in my house
believes, even my lord the duke if needs be, that there is a dulcinea in
el toboso, and that she is living to-day, and that she is beautiful and
nobly born and deserves to have such a knight as senor don quixote in her
service, and that is the highest praise that it is in my power to give
her or that i can think of. but i cannot help entertaining a doubt, and
having a certain grudge against sancho panza; the doubt is this, that the
aforesaid history declares that the said sancho panza, when he carried a
letter on your worship's behalf to the said lady dulcinea, found her
sifting a sack of wheat; and more by token it says it was red wheat; a
thing which makes me doubt the loftiness of her lineage."

to this don quixote made answer, "senora, your highness must know that
everything or almost everything that happens me transcends the ordinary
limits of what happens to other knights-errant;

 as they changed her to me, it is no wonder if
they changed her to him. dulcinea is illustrious and well-born, and of
one of the gentle families of el toboso, which are many, ancient, and

dulcinea, through whom her town will be famous and celebrated in ages to
come, as troy was through helen, and spain through la cava, though with a
better title and tradition. for another thing; i would have your graces
understand that sancho panza is one of the drollest squires that ever
served knight-errant; sometimes there is a simplicity about him so acute
that it is an amusement to try and make out whether he is simple or
sharp; he has mischievous tricks that stamp him rogue, and blundering
ways that prove him a booby; he doubts everything and believes
everything; when i fancy he is on the point of coming down headlong from
sheer stupidity, he comes out with something shrewd that sends him up to
the skies. after all, i would n

sancho took the word out of his mouth and went on, "nay, let them come
and try their jokes on the country bumpkin, for it's about as likely i'll
stand them as that it's now midnight! let them bring me a comb here, or
what they please, and curry this beard of mine, and if they get anything
out of it that offends against cleanliness, let them clip me to the
skin."

upon this, the duchess, laughing all the while, said, "sancho panza is
right, and always will be in all he says; he is clean, and, as he says
himself, he does not require to be washed; and if our ways do not please
him, he is free to choose. besides, you promoters of cleanliness have
been excessively careless and thoughtless, i don't know if i ought not to
say audacious, to bring troughs and wooden utensils and kitchen
dishclouts, instead of basins and jugs of pure gold and towels of
holland, to such a person and such a beard; but, after all, you are

confusion of face went off all of them and left him; whereupon he, seeing
himself safe out of that extreme danger, as it seemed to him, ran and
fell on his knees before the duchess, saying, "from great ladies great
favours may be looked for; this which your grace has done me today cannot
be requited with less than wishing i was dubbed a knight-errant, to
devote myself all the days of my life to the service of so exalted a
lady. i am a labouring man, my name is sancho panza, i am married, i have
children, and i am serving as a squire; if in any one of these ways i can
serve your highness, i will not be longer in obeying than your grace in
commanding."

"it is easy to see, sancho," replied the duchess, "that you have learned
to be polite in the school of politeness itself; i mean to say it is easy
to see that you have been nursed in the bosom of senor don quixote, who
is, of course, the cream of good breeding and flower of ceremony--or

 summer, to serve her excellence he would try with all his

the duchess begged him to tell her about the enchantment or deception, so
sancho told the whole story exactly as it had happened, and his hearers
were not a little amused by it; and then resuming, the duchess said, "in
consequence of what worthy sancho has told me, a doubt starts up in my
mind, and there comes a kind of whisper to my ear that says, 'if don
quixote be mad, crazy, and cracked, and sancho panza his squire knows it,
and, notwithstanding, serves and follows him, and goes trusting to his
empty promises, there can be no doubt he must be still madder and sillier
than his master; and that being so, it will be cast in your teeth, senora
duchess, if you give the said sancho an island to govern; for how will he
who does not know how to govern himself know how to govern others?'"

earnest, i know from good authority that the coarse country wench who
jumped up on the ass was and is dulcinea del toboso, and that worthy
sancho, though he fancies himself the deceiver, is the one that is
deceived; and that there is no more reason to doubt the truth of this,
than of anything else we never saw. senor sancho panza must know that we
too have enchanters here that are well disposed to us, and tell us what
goes on in the world, plainly and distinctly, without subterfuge or
deception; and believe me, sancho, that agile country lass was and is
dulcinea del toboso, who is as much enchanted as the mother that bore
her; and when we least expect it, we shall see her in her own proper
form, and then sancho will be disabused of the error he is under at
present."

saw was a country wench, and i set her down to be a country wench; and if
that was dulcinea it must not be laid at my door, nor should i be called
to answer for it or take the consequences. but they must go nagging at me
at every step--'sancho said it, sancho did it, sancho here, sancho

be in the teeth of some wild beast. in the end the tusked boar fell
pierced by the blades of the many spears they held in front of him; and
don quixote, turning round at the cries of sancho, for he knew by them
that it was he, saw him hanging from the oak head downwards, with dapple,
who did not forsake him in his distress, close beside him; and cide
hamete observes that he seldom saw sancho panza without seeing dapple, or
dapple without seeing sancho panza; such was their attachment and loyalty
one to the other. don quixote went over and unhooked sancho, who, as soon
as he found himself on the ground, looked at the rent in his huntingcoat
and was grieved to the heart, for he thought he had got a patrimonial
estate in that suit.

meanwhile they had slung the mighty boar across the back of a mule, and

will grind your souls between, not to say two, but two thousand proverbs,

"sancho panza's proverbs," said the duchess, "though more in number than
the greek commander's, are not therefore less to be esteemed for the
conciseness of the maxims. for my own part, i can say they give me more
pleasure than others that may be better brought in and more seasonably
introduced."

in pleasant conversation of this sort they passed out of the tent into

hiding-places, and then night closed in, not, however, as brilliantly

"that i didn't," said sancho; "for i can neither read nor write, though i
can sign my name."

"let us see it," said the duchess, "for never fear but you display in it
the quality and quantity of your wit."

sancho drew out an open letter from his bosom, and the duchess, taking
it, found it ran in this fashion:


sancho panza's letter to his wife, teresa panza

if i was well whipped i went mounted like a gentleman; if i have got a
good government it is at the cost of a good whipping. thou wilt not
understand this just now, my teresa; by-and-by thou wilt know what it
means. i may tell thee, teresa, i mean thee to go in a coach, for that is
a matter of importance, because every other way of going is going on
all-fours. thou art a governor's wife; take care that nobody speaks evil
of thee behind thy back. i sen

when she had done reading the letter the duchess said to sancho, "on two
points the worthy governor goes rather astray; one is in saying or
hinting that this government has been bestowed upon him for the lashes
that he is to give himself, when he knows (and he cannot deny it) that
when my lord the duke promised it to him nobody ever dreamt of such a
thing as lashes; the other is that he shows himself here to be very

were permitted me and time allowed, i could prove, not only to those here
present, but to all the world, that there is no virtue that is not to be
found in a duenna."

"i have no doubt," said the duchess, "that my good dona rodriguez is
right, and very much so; but she had better bide her time for fighting
her own battle and that of the rest of the duennas, so as to crush the
calumny of that vile apothecary, and root out the prejudice in the great
sancho panza's mind."

to which sancho replied, "ever since i have sniffed the governorship i
have got rid of the humours of a squire, and i don't care a wild fig for
all the duennas in the world."

they would have carried on this duenna dispute further had they not heard
the notes of the fife and drums once more, from which they concluded that
the distressed duenna was making her entrance. the duchess asked the duke
if it would be proper to go out to receive her, as she was a countess and

valorous errant, whose veritable achievements leave behind and eclipse
the fabulous ones of the amadises, esplandians, and belianises!" then
turning from don quixote to sancho panza, and grasping his hands, she
said, "o thou, most loyal squire that ever served knight-errant in this
present age or ages past, whose goodness is more extensive than the beard

the duke, the duchess, and all in the garden were listening to the
conversation of the two heroes, and were beyond measure amused by it; and
now, desirous of putting a finishing touch to this rare and
well-contrived adventure, they applied a light to clavileno's tail with
some tow, and the horse, being full of squibs and crackers, immediately
blew up with a prodigious noise, and brought don quixote and sancho panza
to the ground half singed. by this time the bearded band of duennas, the
trifaldi and all, had vanished from the garden, and those that remained
lay stretched on the ground as if in a swoon. don quixote and sancho got
up rather shaken, and, looking about them, were filled with amazement at
finding themselves in the same garden from which they had started, and
seeing such a number of people stretched on the ground; and their
astonishment was increased when at one side of the garden they p

 was the end of the adventure of the
distressed duenna, which gave the duke and duchess laughing matter not
only for the time being, but for all their lives, and sancho something to
talk about for ages, if he lived so long; but don quixote, coming close
to his ear, said to him, "sancho, as you would have us believe what you
saw in heaven, i require you to believe me as to what i saw in the cave
of montesinos; i say no more."

of the counsels which don quixote gave sancho panza before he set out to
govern the island, together with other well-considered matters


the duke and duchess were so well pleased with the successful and droll
result of the adventure of the distressed one, that they resolved to
carry on the joke, seeing what a fit subject they had to deal with for
making it all pass for reality. so having laid their plans and given
instructions to their servants and vassals how to behave to sancho in his

"may i be buried with you, sancho," said the duke, "but you know
everything; i hope you will make as good a governor as your sagacity
promises; and that is all i have to say; and now remember to-morrow is
the day you must set out for the government of the island, and this
evening they will provide you with the proper attire for you to wear, and
all things requisite for your departure."

"let them dress me as they like," said sancho; "however i'm dressed i'll
be sancho panza."

"that's true," said the duke; "but one's dress must be suited to the
office or rank one holds; for it would not do for a jurist to dress like
a soldier, or a soldier like a priest. you, sancho, shall go partly as a
lawyer, partly as a captain, for, in the island i am giving you, arms are
needed as much as letters, and letters as much as arms."

"of letters i know but little," said sancho, "for i don't even know the a

who, hearing the foregoing discourse of don quixote, would not have set
him down for a person of great good sense and greater rectitude of
purpose? but, as has been frequently observed in the course of this great
history, he only talked nonsense when he touched on chivalry, and in
discussing all other subjects showed that he had a clear and unbiassed
understanding; so that at every turn his acts gave the lie to his
intellect, and his intellect to his acts; but in the case of these se

how sancho panza was conducted to his government, and of the strange
adventure that befell don quixote in the castle


it is stated, they say, in the true original of this history, that when
cide hamete came to write this chapter, his interpreter did not translate
it as he wrote it--that is, as a kind of complaint the moor made against
himself for having taken in hand a story so dry and of so little variety
as this of don quixote, for he found himself forced to speak perpetually
of him and sancho, with

the great dulcinea del toboso live a thousand years, and may her fame
extend all over the surface of the globe, for she deserves to be loved by
a knight so valiant and so virtuous; and may kind heaven infuse zeal into
the heart of our governor sancho panza to finish off his discipline
speedily, so that the world may once more enjoy the beauty of so grand a
lady."

to which don quixote replied, "your highness has spoken like what you
are; from the mouth of a noble lady nothing bad can come; and dulcinea
will be more fortunate, and better known to the world by the praise of
your highness than by all the eulogies the greatest orators on earth
could bestow upon her."

he shut the window with a bang, and, as much out of temper and out of
sorts as if some great misfortune had befallen him, stretched himself on
his bed, where we will leave him for the present, as the great sancho
panza, who is about to set up his famous government, now demands our
attention.

to come to the point, then--sancho with all his attendants arrived at a
village of some thousand inhabitants, and one of the largest the duke
possessed. they informed him that it was called the island of barataria,
either because the name of the village was baratario, or because of the
joke by way of which the government had been conferred upon him. on
reaching the gates of the town, which was a walled one, the m

while the majordomo was making this speech sancho was gazing at several
large letters inscribed on the wall opposite his seat, and as he could
not read he asked what that was that was painted on the wall. the answer
was, "senor, there is written and recorded the day on which your lordship
took possession of this island, and the inscription says, 'this day, the
so-and-so of such-and-such a month and year, senor don sancho panza took
possession of this island; many years may he enjoy it.'"

"and whom do they call don sancho panza?" asked sancho.

"your lordship," replied the majordomo; "for no other panza but the one
who is now seated in that chair has ever entered this island."

"well then, let me tell you, brother," said sancho, "i haven't got the
'don,' nor has any one of my family ever had it; my name is plain sancho

, but because he recognised their good
intentions in coming to his rescue. the duke and duchess left him to
repose and withdrew greatly grieved at the unfortunate result of the
joke; as they never thought the adventure would have fallen so heavy on
don quixote or cost him so dear, for it cost him five days of confinement
to his bed, during which he had another adventure, pleasanter than the
late one, which his chronicler will not relate just now in order that he
may turn his attention to sancho panza, who was proceeding with great
diligence and drollery in his government.




chapter xlvii.

wherein is continued the account of how sancho panza conducted himself in
his government


the history says that from the justice court they carried sancho to a
sumptuous palace, where in a spacious chamber there was a table laid out
with royal magnificence. the clarions sounded as sancho entered the room,
and four pages came forward to present him with water for his hands,
which sancho

he would have made a tirteafuera out of the room but that the same
instant a post-horn sounded in the street; and the carver putting his
head out of the window turned round and said, "it's a courier from my
lord the duke, no doubt with some despatch of importance."

the courier came in all sweating and flurried, and taking a paper from
his bosom, placed it in the governor's hands. sancho handed it to the
majordomo and bade him read the superscription, which ran thus: to don
sancho panza, governor of the island of barataria, into his own hands or
those of his secretary. sancho when he heard this said, "which of you is
my secretary?" "i am, senor," said one of those present, "for i can read
and write, and am a biscayan." "with that addition," said sancho, "you
might be secretary to the emperor himself; open this paper and see what
it says." the new-born secretary obeyed, and having read the contents
said the matter was one to be discussed in private. sancho ordered the

amber to be cleared, the majordomo and the carver only remaining; so
the doctor and the others withdrew, and then the secretary read the
letter, which was as follows:

of mine and of the island are about to make a furious attack upon it some
night, i know not when. it behoves you to be on the alert and keep watch,
that they surprise you not. i also know by trustworthy spies that four
persons have entered the town in disguise in order to take your life,
because they stand in dread of your great capacity; keep your eyes open
and take heed who approaches you to address you, and eat nothing that is
presented to you. i will take care t

only flesh and blood, and must give to nature what she naturally demands
of them; all except myself, for in my case i give her nothing to eat,
thanks to senor doctor pedro recio tirteafuera here, who would have me
die of hunger, and declares that death to be life; and the same sort of
life may god give him and all his kind--i mean the bad doctors; for the
good ones deserve palms and laurels."

all who knew sancho panza were astonished to hear him speak so elegantly,
and did not know what to attribute it to unless it were that office and
grave responsibility either smarten or stupefy men's wits. at last doctor
pedro recio agilers of tirteafuera promised to let him have supper that
night though it might be in contravention of all the aphorisms of
hippocrates. with this the governor was satisfied and looked forward to
the approach of night and supper-time with great anxiety; and though
time, to his mind,

to open the negotiation at the proper season, persuading himself that no
husband could be refused to a governor's daughter. and so the night's
round came to an end, and a couple of days later the government, whereby
all his plans were overthrown and swept away, as will be seen farther on.

wherein is set forth who the enchanters and executioners were who flogged
the duenna and pinched don quixote, and also what befell the page who
carried the letter to teresa panza, sancho panza's wife


cide hamete, the painstaking investigator of the minute points of this
veracious history, says that when dona rodriguez left her own room to go
to don quixote's, another duenna who slept with her observed her, and as
all duennas are fond of prying, listening, and sniffing, she followed her
so silently that the good rodriguez never perceived it; and as soon as
the duenna saw her enter don quixote's room, not to fail in a duenna's
invariable practice of tattling, she hurried off
 
 ___________________________
 
nto the room and tormented don quixote and flogged the duenna in the
manner already described; for indignities offered to their charms and
self-esteem mightily provoke the anger of women and make them eager for
revenge. the duchess told the duke what had happened, and he was much
amused by it; and she, in pursuance of her design of making merry and
diverting herself with don quixote, despatched the page who had played
the part of dulcinea in the negotiations for her disenchantment (which
sancho panza in the cares of government had forgotten all about) to
teresa panza his wife with her husband's letter and another from herself,
and also a great string of fine coral beads as a present.

now the history says this page was very sharp and quick-witted; and eager
to serve his lord and lady he set off very willingly for sancho's
village. before he entered it he observed a number of women washing in a
brook, and asked them if they could tell him whether there lived there a
woman of the name

 of teresa panza, wife of one sancho panza, squire to a
knight called don quixote of la mancha. at the question a young girl who
was washing stood up and said, "teresa panza is my mother, and that
sancho is my father, and that knight is our master."

"well then, miss," said the page, "come and show me where your mother is,
for i bring her a letter and a present from your father."

"that i will with all my heart, senor," said the girl, who seemed to be
about fourteen, more or less; and leaving the clothes she was washing to
one

she was not very old, though plainly past
forty, strong, healthy, vigorous, and sun-dried; and seeing her daughter
and the page on horseback, she exclaimed, "what's this, child? what
gentleman is this?"

"a servant of my lady, dona teresa panza," replied the page; and suiting
the action to the word he flung himself off his horse, and with great
humility advanced to kneel before the lady teresa, saying, "let me kiss
your hand, senora dona teresa, as the lawful and only wife of senor don
sancho panza, rightful governor of the island of barataria."

"ah, senor, get up, do that," said teresa; "for i'm not a bit of a court
lady, but only a poor country woman, the daughter of a clodcrusher, and
the wife of a squire-errant and not of any governor at all."

"you are," said the page, "the most worthy wife of a most arch-worthy
governor; and as a proof of what i say accept this letter and this
present;" and at the same time he took out of his pocket a string of
coral beads with gold clasps

they did so, and teresa returned with them. they found the page sifting a
little barley for his horse, and sanchica cutting a rasher of bacon to be
paved with eggs for his dinner. his looks and his handsome apparel
pleased them both greatly; and after they had saluted him courteously,
and he them, samson begged him to give them his news, as well of don
quixote as of sancho panza, for, he said, though they had read the
letters from sancho and her ladyship the duchess, they were still puzzled
and could not make out what was meant by sancho's government, and above
all of an island, when all or most of those in the mediterranean belonged
to his majesty.

to this the page replied, "as to senor sancho panza's being a governor
there is no doubt whatever; but whether it is an island or not that he
governs, with that i have nothing to do; suffice it that it is a town of

him? because we, although we have
handled the present and read the letters, don't believe it and suspect it
to be something in the line of our fellow-townsman don quixote, who
fancies that everything is done by enchantment; and for this reason i am
almost ready to say that i'd like to touch and feel your worship to see
whether you are a mere ambassador of the imagination or a man of flesh
and blood."

"all i know, sirs," replied the page, "is that i am a real ambassador,
and that senor sancho panza is governor as a matter of fact, and that my
lord and lady the duke and duchess can give, and have given him this same
government, and that i have heard it said sancho panza bears himself
very stoutly therein; whether there be any enchantment in all this or
not, it is for your worships to settle between you; for that's all i know
by the oath i swear, and that is by the life of my parents whom i have
still alive, and love dearly."

"it may be so," said the bachelor; "but dubitat augustin

s they were taking away
the cloth there came a courier with a letter from don quixote for the
governor. sancho ordered the secretary to read it to himself, and if
there was nothing in it that demanded secrecy to read it aloud. the
secretary did so, and after he had skimmed the contents he said, "it may
well be read aloud, for what senor don quixote writes to your worship
deserves to be printed or written in letters of gold, and it is as
follows."


don quixote of la mancha's letter to sancho panza, governor of the island
of barataria.

sancho, i have received intelligence of thy displays of good sense, for
which i give special thanks to heaven that can raise the poor from the
dunghill and of fools to make wise men. they tell me thou dost govern as
if thou wert a man, and art a man as if thou wert a beast, so great is
the humility wherewith thou dost comport thyself. but i would have thee
bear in mind, sancho, t

friend, don quixote of la mancha.


sancho listened to the letter with great attention, and it was praised
and considered wise by all who heard it; he then rose up from table, and
calling his secretary shut himself in with him in his own room, and
without putting it off any longer set about answering his master don
quixote at once; and he bade the secretary write down what he told him
without adding or suppressing anything, which he did, and the answer was
to the following effect.


sancho panza's letter to don quixote of la mancha.

the pressure of business is so great upon me that i have no time to
scratch my head or even to cut my nails; and i have them so long-god send
a remedy for it. i say this, master of my soul, that you may not be
surprised if i have not until now sent you word of how i fare, well or
ill, in this government, in which i am suffering more hunger than when we
two were wandering through the woods and wastes.

the secretary sealed the letter, and immediately dismissed the courier;
and those who were carrying on the joke against sancho putting their
heads together arranged how he was to be dismissed from the government.
sancho spent the afternoon in drawing up certain ordinances relating to
the good government of what he fancied the island; and he ordained that
there were to be no provision hucksters in the state, and that men might
import wine into it from any place they plea

most of those the blind men sing are trumped up, to the detriment of the

many a sturdy thief or drunkard goes about under cover of a make-believe

to this day they are preserved there, and are called the constitutions of

all were greatly amused by teresa panza's letter, but particularly the
duke and duchess; and the duchess asked don quixote's opinion whether
they might open the letter that had come for the governor, which she
suspected must be very good. don quixote said that to gratify them he
would open it, and did so, and found that it ran as follows.

and it raised some doubts as to the governor's simplicity. the duchess
withdrew to hear from the page about his adventures in sancho's village,
which he narrated at full length without leaving a single circumstance
unmentioned. he gave her the acorns, and also a cheese which teresa had

understand that he had not the sign of a coin about him, and urging
dapple forward he broke through them. but as he was passing, one of them
who had been examining him very closely rushed towards him, and flinging
his arms round him exclaimed in a loud voice and good spanish, "god bless
me! what's this i see? is it possible that i hold in my arms my dear
friend, my good neighbour sancho panza? but there's no doubt about it,
for i'm not asleep, nor am i drunk just now."

sancho was surprised to hear himself called by his name and find himself
embraced by a foreign pilgrim, and after regarding him steadily without
speaking he was still unable to recognise him; but the pilgrim perceiving
his perplexity cried, "what! and is it possible, sancho panza, that thou
dost not know thy neighbour ricote, the morisco shopkeeper of thy
village?"

drawing sancho aside, they seated themselves at the foot of a beech,
leaving the pilgrims buried in sweet sleep; and without once falling into
his own morisco tongue ricote spoke as follows in pure castilian:

"thou knowest well, neighbour and friend sancho panza, how the

he pulled him up, however, without a fall, and coming a little closer
examined the hole without dismounting; but as he was looking at it he
heard loud cries proceeding from it, and by listening attentively was
able to make out that he who uttered them was saying, "ho, above there!
is there any christian that hears me, or any charitable gentleman that
will take pity on a sinner buried alive, on an unfortunate disgoverned
governor?"

it struck don quixote that it was the voice of sancho panza he heard,
whereat he was taken aback and amazed, and raising his own voice as much
as he could, he cried out, "who is below there? who is that complaining?"

"who should be here, or who should complain," was the answer, "but the
forlorn sancho panza, for his sins and for his ill-luck governor of the
island of barataria, squire that was to the famous knight don quixote of
la mancha?"

perturbation grew greater than ever, f

"in that case," answered the voice, "your worship who speaks to me must
be my master don quixote of la mancha; nay, from the tone of the voice it
is plain it can be nobody else."

"don quixote i am," replied don quixote, "he whose profession it is to
aid and succour the living and the dead in their necessities; wherefore
tell me who thou art, for thou art keeping me in suspense; because, if
thou art my squire sancho panza, and art dead, since the devils have not
carried thee off, and thou art by god's mercy in purgatory, our holy
mother the roman catholic church has intercessory means sufficient to
release thee from the pains thou art in; and i for my part will plead
with her to that end, so far as my substance will go; without further

at it; they could easily understand his having fallen, from the
confirmatory circumstance of the cave which had been in existence there
from time immemorial; but they could not imagine how he had quitted the
government without their receiving any intimation of his coming. to be
brief, they fetched ropes and tackle, as the saying is, and by dint of
many hands and much labour they drew up dapple and sancho panza out of
the darkness into the light of day. a student who saw him remarked,
"that's the way all bad governors should come out of their governments,
as this sinner comes out of the depths of the pit, dead with hunger,
pale, and i suppose without a farthing."

sancho overheard him and said, "it is eight or ten days, brother growler,

that time i never had a bellyful of victuals, no not for an hour; doctors

the game of the boys when they say, 'leap thou, and give me one,' i take

the duke and duchess had no reason to regret the joke that had been
played upon sancho panza in giving him the government; especially as
their majordomo returned the same day, and gave them a minute account of
almost every word and deed that sancho uttered or did during the time;
and to wind up with, eloquently described to them the attack upon the
island and sancho's fright and departure, with which they were not a
little amused. after this the history goes on to say that the day fixed
for the battle arrived, and that the duke, after having repeatedly
instructed his lacquey tos

missed by suffering himself to remain shut up and inactive amid the
countless luxuries and enjoyments his hosts lavished upon him as a
knight, and he felt too that he would have to render a strict account to
heaven of that indolence and seclusion; and so one day he asked the duke
and duchess to grant him permission to take his departure. they gave it,
showing at the same time that they were very sorry he was leaving them.

the duchess gave his wife's letters to sancho panza, who shed tears over
them, saying, "who would have thought that such grand hopes as the news
of my government bred in my wife teresa panza's breast would end in my
going back now to the vagabond adventures of my master don quixote of la

who is with him is one sancho panza his squire, whose drolleries none can

"that's true," said sancho; "i am that same droll and squire you speak
of, and this gentleman is my master don quixote of la mancha, the same
that's in the history and that they talk about."

a crowd of men on horseback, many of them with lances in their hands, all
riding in a compact body and in great haste. no sooner had those who were
with don quixote seen them than they turned about and withdrew to some
distance from the road, for they knew that if they stayed some harm might
come to them; but don quixote with intrepid heart stood his ground, and
sancho panza shielded himself with rocinante's hind-quarters. the troop
of lancers came up, and one of them who was in advance began shouting to
don quixote, "get out of the way, you son of the devil, or these bulls
will knock you to pieces!"

"rabble!" returned don quixote, "i care nothing for bulls, be they the
fiercest jarama breeds on its banks. confess at once, scoundrels, that

next that the language is aragonese, for sometimes he writes without
articles; and the third, which above all stamps him as ignorant, is that
he goes wrong and departs from the truth in the most important part of
the history, for here he says that my squire sancho panza's wife is
called mari gutierrez, when she is called nothing of the sort, but teresa
panza; and when a man errs on such an important point as this there is
good reason to fear that he is in error on every other point in the
history."

"a nice sort of historian, indeed!" exclaimed sancho at this; "he must
know a deal about our affairs when he calls my wife teresa panza, mari

captain, who was about thirty-four years of age apparently, strongly

he was mounted upon a powerful horse, and had on a coat of mail, with
four of the pistols they call petronels in that country at his waist. he
saw that his squires (for so they call those who follow that trade) were
about to rifle sancho panza, but he ordered them to desist and was at
once obeyed, so the girdle escaped. he wondered to see the lance leaning
against the tree, the shield on the ground, and don quixote in armour and
dejected, with the saddest and most melancholy face that sadness itself
could produce; and going up to him he said, "be not so cast down, good

that they might divert themselves with him. he wished, he said, his
enemies the cadells could be deprived of this pleasure; but that was
impossible, because the crazes and shrewd sayings of don quixote and the
humours of his squire sancho panza could not help giving general pleasure

all were thunderstruck at this, and all the more so as they saw that
there was nobody anywhere near the table or in the whole room that could
have answered. "how many of us are here?" asked don antonio once more;
and it was answered him in the same way softly, "thou and thy wife, with
two friends of thine and two of hers, and a famous knight called don
quixote of la mancha, and a squire of his, sancho panza by name."

now there was fresh astonishment; now everyone's hair was standing on end
with awe; and don antonio retiring from the head exclaimed, "this
suffices to show me that i have not been deceived by him who sold thee to
me, o sage head, talking head, answering head, wonderful head! let some
one else go and put what question he likes to it."

the last questioner was sancho, and his questions were, "head, shall i by
any chance have another government? shall i ever escape from the hard
life of a squire? shall i get back to see my wife and children?" to which
the answer came, "thou shalt govern in thy house; and if thou returnest
to it thou shalt see thy wife and children; and on ceasing to serve thou
shalt cease to be a squire."

"good, by god!" said sancho panza; "i could have told myself that; the
prophet perogrullo could have said no more."

"what answer wouldst thou have, beast?" said don quixote; "is it not
enough that the replies this head has given suit the questions put to
it?"

"yes, it is enough," said sancho; "but i should have liked it to have
made itself plainer and told me more."

the questions and answers came to an end here, but not the wonder with
which all were filled, except don antonio's two friends who were in the

galleys that he intended to bring his guest, the famous don quixote of la

wrong you have done
the whole world in trying to bring the most amusing madman in it back to
his senses. do you not see, senor, that the gain by don quixote's sanity
can never equal the enjoyment his crazes give? but my belief is that all
the senor bachelor's pains will be of no avail to bring a man so
hopelessly cracked to his senses again; and if it were not uncharitable,
i would say may don quixote never be cured, for by his recovery we lose
not only his own drolleries, but his squire sancho panza's too, any one
of which is enough to turn melancholy itself into merriment. however,
i'll hold my peace and say nothing to him, and we'll see whether i am
right in my suspicion that senor carrasco's efforts will be fruitless."

the bachelor replied that at all events the affair promised well, and he
hoped for a happy result from it; and putting his services at don

all. the fact of the matter was that some men were taking above six
hundred pigs to sell at a fair, and were on their way with them at that
hour, and so great was the noise they made and their grunting and
blowing, that they deafened the ears of don quixote and sancho panza, and
they could not make out what it was. the wide-spread grunting drove came
on in a surging mass, and without showing any respect for don quixote's
dignity or sancho's, passed right over the pair of them, demolishing
sancho's entrenchments, and not only upsetting don quixote but sweeping
rocinante off his feet into the bargain; and what with the trampling and
the grunting, and the pace at which the unclean beasts went, pack-saddle,

enough, divine singer! it would be an endless task to put before us now
the death and the charms of the peerless altisidora, not dead as the
ignorant world imagines, but living in the voice of fame and in the

she pleased; and she might have left me alone, for i never made her fall

myself; and so i beg of your worship to let me sleep and not ask me any

d samson carrasco, "if they fail us, we can call them by the
names of the ones in print that the world is filled with, filidas,
amarilises, dianas, fleridas, galateas, belisardas; for as they sell them
in the market-places we may fairly buy them and make them our own. if my
lady, or i should say my shepherdess, happens to be called ana, i'll sing
her praises under the name of anarda, and if francisca, i'll call her
francenia, and if lucia, lucinda, for it all comes to the same thing; and
sancho panza, if he joins this fraternity, may glorify his wife teresa
panza as teresaina."

don quixote laughed at the adaptation of the name, and the curate
bestowed vast praise upon the worthy and honourable resolution he had
made, and again offered to bear him company all the time that he could
spare from his imperative duties. and so they took their leave of him,
recommending and beseeching him to take care of his health and treat
himself to a suitable diet.

it so happened his niece and the

from its beginning to its end, and above all man's life, and as don
quixote's enjoyed no special dispensation from heaven to stay its course,
its end and close came when he least looked for it. for whether it was of
the dejection the thought of his defeat produced, or of heaven's will
that so ordered it--a fever settled upon him and kept him in his bed for
six days, during which he was often visited by his friends the curate,
the bachelor, and the barber, while his good squire sancho panza never
quitted his bedside. they, persuaded that it was grief at finding himself
vanquished, and the object of his heart, the liberation and
disenchantment of dulcinea, unattained, that kept him in this state,
strove by all the means in their power to cheer him up; the bachelor
bidding him take heart and get up to begin his pastoral life, for which
he himself, he said, had already composed an eclogue that would take the
shine out of all sannazaro had ever written, and had bought with his

e notary and returned shortly afterwards
with him and with sancho, who, having already learned from the bachelor
the condition his master was in, and finding the housekeeper and niece
weeping, began to blubber and shed tears.

the confession over, the curate came out saying, "alonso quixano the good
is indeed dying, and is indeed in his right mind; we may now go in to him
while he makes his will."

this news gave a tremendous impulse to the brimming eyes of the
housekeeper, niece, and sancho panza his good squire, making the tears
burst from their eyes and a host of sighs from their hearts; for of a
truth, as has been said more than once, whether as plain alonso quixano
the good, or as don quixote of la mancha, don quixote was always of a
gentle disposition and kindly in all his ways, and hence he was beloved,
not only by those of his own house, but by all who knew him.

the notary came in with the rest, and as soon as the preamble of the will had
been set out and don quixote had

we agreed. perhaps behind some bush we shall find the lady dulcinea
disenchanted, as fine as fine can be. if it be that you are dying of
vexation at having been vanquished, lay the blame on me, and say you were
overthrown because i had girthed rocinante badly; besides you must have
seen in your books of chivalry that it is a common thing for knights to
upset one another, and for him who is conquered to-day to be conqueror
tomorrow."

"very true," said samson, "and good sancho panza's view of these cases is
quite right."

"sirs, not so fast," said don quixote, "'in last year's nests there are
no birds this year.' i was mad, now i am in my senses; i was don quixote
of la mancha, i am now, as i said, alonso quixano the good; and may my
repentance and sincerity restore me to the esteem you used to have for
me; and now let master notary proceed.

"item, i leave all my property absolutely to antonia quixana my niece,
here present, after all has been deducted from the

has written in it; for i am leaving the world with a feeling of
compunction at having provoked him to write them."

with this he closed his will, and a faintness coming over him he
stretched himself out at full length on the bed. all were in a flutter
and made haste to relieve him, and during the three days he lived after
that on which he made his will he fainted away very often. the house was
all in confusion; but still the niece ate and the housekeeper drank and
sancho panza enjoyed himself; for inheriting property wipes out or
softens down in the heir the feeling of grief the dead man might be
expected to leave behind him.

at last don quixote's end came, after he had received all the sacraments,
and had in full and forcible terms expressed his detestation of books of
chivalry. the notary was there at the time, and he said that in no book
of chivalry had he ever read of any knight-errant dying in his bed so
calmly and so like a christian as don quixote, wh
