soul of marija was alone unconquered. she drove on the dancers--what had
once been the ring had now the shape of a pear, with marija at the stem,
pulling one way and pushing the other, shouting, stamping, singing, a
very volcano of energy. now and then some one coming in or out would
leave the door open, and the night air was chill; marija as she passed
would stretch out her foot and kick the doorknob, and slam would go
the door! once this procedure was the cause of a calamity of which
sebastijonas szedvilas was the hapless victim. little sebastijonas, aged
three, had been wandering about oblivious to all things, holding turned
up over his mouth a bottle of liquid known as ‚Äúpop,‚Äù pink-colored,
ice-cold, and delicious. passing through the doorway the door smote
him full, and the shriek which followed brought the dancing to a halt.
marija, who threatened horrid murder a hundred times a day, and would
weep over the injury of a fly, seized little sebastijonas in her arms

leaving his place, in spite of their paying. now he said it a third
time, and ona drew a deep breath; it was so wonderful to have a husband,
just like a grown woman--and a husband who could solve all problems, and
who was so big and strong!

the last sob of little sebastijonas has been stifled, and the orchestra
has once more been reminded of its duty. the ceremony begins again--but
there are few now left to dance with, and so very soon the collection is
over and promiscuous dances once more begin. it is now after midnight,
however, and things are not as they were before. the dancers are dull
and heavy--most of them have been drinking hard, and have long ago
passed the stage of exhilaration. they dance in monotonous measure,

in the fall, after the harvest
was over, he saw that it would not do, and tramped the full fortnight‚Äôs
journey that lay between him and ona.

he found an unexpected state of affairs--for the girl‚Äôs father had died,
and his estate was tied up with creditors; jurgis‚Äô heart leaped as he
realized that now the prize was within his reach. there was elzbieta
lukoszaite, teta, or aunt, as they called her, ona‚Äôs stepmother, and
there were her six children, of all ages. there was also her brother
jonas, a dried-up little man who had worked upon the farm. they were
people of great consequence, as it seemed to jurgis, fresh out of the
woods; ona knew how to read, and knew many other things that he did
not know, and now the farm had been sold, and the whole family was
adrift--all they owned in the world being about seven hundred rubles
which is half as many dollars. they would have had three times that, but
it had gone to court, and the judge had decided against them, and it had
cost the balance

 to get him to change his decision.

ona might have married and left them, but she would not, for she loved
teta elzbieta. it was jonas who suggested that they all go to america,
where a friend of his had gotten rich. he would work, for his part, and
the women would work, and some of the children, doubtless--they would
live somehow. jurgis, too, had heard of america. that was a country
where, they said, a man might earn three rubles a day; and jurgis
figured what three rubles a day would mean, with prices as they were
where he lived, and decided forthwith that he would go to america and
marry, and be a rich man in the bargain.

their precious money, which they clung to with such horrible fear. this
happened to them again in new york--for, of course, they knew nothing
about the country, and had no one to tell them, and it was easy for a
man in a blue uniform to lead them away, and to take them to a hotel and
keep them there, and make them pay enormous charges to get away. the law
says that the rate card shall be on the door of a hotel, but it does not
say that it shall be in lithuanian.


it was in the stockyards that jonas‚Äô friend had gotten rich, and so to
chicago the party was bound. they knew that one word, chicago and that
was all they needed to know, at least, until they reached the city.
then, tumbled out of the cars without ceremony, they were no better off
than before; they stood staring down the vista of dearborn street, with
its big black buildings towering in the distance, unable to realize that
they had arrived, and why, when they said ‚Äúchicago,‚Äù people no longer

suggested endless activity, the rumblings of a world in motion. it was
only by an effort that one could realize that it was made by animals,
that it was the distant lowing of ten thousand cattle, the distant
grunting of ten thousand swine.

they would have liked to follow it up, but, alas, they had no time for
adventures just then. the policeman on the corner was beginning to watch
them; and so, as usual, they started up the street. scarcely had they
gone a block, however, before jonas was heard to give a cry, and began
pointing excitedly across the street. before they could gather the
meaning of his breathless ejaculations he had bounded away, and they saw
him enter a shop, over which was a sign: ‚Äúj. szedvilas, delicatessen.‚Äù
 when he came out again it was in company with a very stout gentleman in
shirt sleeves and an apron, clasping jonas by both hands and laughing
hilariously. then teta elzbieta recollected suddenly that szedvilas
had been the name of the mythical frie

by looking further,
for mrs. jukniene had at least kept one room for herself and her three
little children, and now offered to share this with the women and the
girls of the party. they could get bedding at a secondhand store,
she explained; and they would not need any, while the weather was so
hot--doubtless they would all sleep on the sidewalk such nights as this,
as did nearly all of her guests. ‚Äútomorrow,‚Äù jurgis said, when they were
left alone, ‚Äútomorrow i will get a job, and perhaps jonas will get one
also; and then we can get a place of our own.‚Äù

later that afternoon he and ona went out to take a walk and look about
them, to see more of this district which was to be their home. in back
of the yards the dreary two-story frame houses were scattered farther
apart, and there were great spaces bare--that seemingly had been
overlooked by the great sore of a city as it spread itself over the
surface of the prairie. these bare places were grown up with dingy,
yellow weeds, hiding in

chapter 3


in his capacity as delicatessen vender, jokubas szedvilas had many
acquaintances. among these was one of the special policemen employed
by durham, whose duty it frequently was to pick out men for employment.
jokubas had never tried it, but he expressed a certainty that he could
get some of his friends a job through this man. it was agreed, after
consultation, that he should make the effort with old antanas and with
jonas. jurgis was confident of his ability to get work for himself,
unassisted by any one. as we have said before, he was not mistaken in
this. he had gone to brown‚Äôs and stood there not more than half an hour
before one of the bosses noticed his form towering above the rest, and
signaled to him. the colloquy which followed was brief and to the point:

‚Äúspeak english?‚Äù

‚Äúno; lit-uanian.‚Äù (jurgis had studied this word carefully.)

‚Äújob?‚Äù

‚Äúje.‚Äù (a nod.)

ith joy--he was at
work at last! he was at work and earning money! all day long he was
figuring to himself. he was paid the fabulous sum of seventeen and a
half cents an hour; and as it proved a rush day and he worked until
nearly seven o‚Äôclock in the evening, he went home to the family with
the tidings that he had earned more than a dollar and a half in a single
day!

at home, also, there was more good news; so much of it at once that
there was quite a celebration in aniele‚Äôs hall bedroom. jonas had been
to have an interview with the special policeman to whom szedvilas had
introduced him, and had been taken to see several of the bosses, with
the result that one had promised him a job the beginning of the next
week. and then there was marija berczynskas, who, fired with jealousy by
the success of jurgis, had set out upon her own responsibility to get a
place. marija had nothing to take with her save her two brawny arms
and the word ‚Äújob,‚Äù laboriously learned; but with these she had

better luck than all this could hardly have been hoped for; there was
only one of them left to seek a place. jurgis was determined that teta
elzbieta should stay at home to keep house, and that ona should help
her. he would not have ona working--he was not that sort of a man, he
said, and she was not that sort of a woman. it would be a strange thing
if a man like him could not support the family, with the help of
the board of jonas and marija. he would not even hear of letting the
children go to work--there were schools here in america for children,
jurgis had heard, to which they could go for nothing. that the priest
would object to these schools was something of which he had as yet no
idea, and for the present his mind was made up that the children of teta
elzbieta should have as fair a chance as any other children. the oldest
of them, little stanislovas, was but thirteen, and small for his age
at that; and while the ol

arranged--and they were to go and make an inspection the following
sunday morning.

that was thursday; and all the rest of the week the killing gang
at brown‚Äôs worked at full pressure, and jurgis cleared a dollar
seventy-five every day. that was at the rate of ten and one-half dollars
a week, or forty-five a month. jurgis was not able to figure, except it
was a very simple sum, but ona was like lightning at such things, and
she worked out the problem for the family. marija and jonas were each
to pay sixteen dollars a month board, and the old man insisted that he
could do the same as soon as he got a place--which might be any day now.
that would make ninety-three dollars. then marija and jonas were between
them to take a third share in the house, which would leave only eight
dollars a month for jurgis to contribute to the payment. so they would
have eighty-five dollars a month--or, supposing that dede antanas did
not get work at once, seventy dollars a month--which ought su

too, they would swindle you with the contract--and how was a poor man
to understand anything about a contract? it was all nothing but robbery,
and there was no safety but in keeping out of it. and pay rent? asked
jurgis. ah, yes, to be sure, the other answered, that too was robbery.
it was all robbery, for a poor man. after half an hour of such
depressing conversation, they had their minds quite made up that they
had been saved at the brink of a precipice; but then szedvilas went
away, and jonas, who was a sharp little man, reminded them that the
delicatessen business was a failure, according to its proprietor, and
that this might account for his pessimistic views. which, of course,
reopened the subject!

the controlling factor was that they could not stay where they
were--they had to go somewhere. and when they gave up the house plan and
decided to rent, the prospect of paying out nine dollars a month forever
they found just as hard to face. all day and all night for nearly a

ek they wrestled with the problem, and then in the end jurgis
took the responsibility. brother jonas had gotten his job, and was
pushing a truck in durham‚Äôs; and the killing gang at brown‚Äôs continued
to work early and late, so that jurgis grew more confident every hour,
more certain of his mastership. it was the kind of thing the man of the
family had to decide and carry through, he told himself. others might
have failed at it, but he was not the failing kind--he would show them
how to do it. he would work all day, and all night, too, if need be; he
would never rest until the house was pai

ch one was to be driven. then jurgis would try to hammer,
and hit his fingers because the hammer was too small, and get mad
because ona had refused to let him pay fifteen cents more and get a
bigger hammer; and ona would be invited to try it herself, and hurt
her thumb, and cry out, which necessitated the thumb‚Äôs being kissed
by jurgis. finally, after every one had had a try, the nails would be
driven, and something hung up. jurgis had come home with a big packing
box on his head, and he sent jonas to get another that he had bought. he
meant to take one side out of these tomorrow, and put shelves in them,
and make them into bureaus and places to keep things for the bedrooms.
the nest which had been advertised had not included feathers for quite
so many birds as there were in this family.

they had, of course, put their dining table in the kitchen, and the
dining room was used as the bedroom of teta elzbieta and five of her
children. she and the two youngest slept in the only bed, and the

loor was filthy, yet
they set antanas with his mop slopping the ‚Äúpickle‚Äù into a hole that
connected with a sink, where it was caught and used over again forever;
and if that were not enough, there was a trap in the pipe, where all the
scraps of meat and odds and ends of refuse were caught, and every few
days it was the old man‚Äôs task to clean these out, and shovel their
contents into one of the trucks with the rest of the meat!

this was the experience of antanas; and then there came also jonas and
marija with tales to tell. marija was working for one of the independent
packers, and was quite beside herself and outrageous with triumph over
the sums of money she was making as a painter of cans. but one day she
walked home with a pale-faced little woman who worked opposite to her,
jadvyga marcinkus by name, and jadvyga told her how she, marija, had
chanced to get her job. she had taken the place of an irishwoman who had
been working in that factory ever since any one could remember. for

ny difference
to her--it was doubtful if she even knew that, for both the forelady and
the superintendent were new people, having only been there two or three
years themselves. jadvyga did not know what had become of the poor
creature; she would have gone to see her, but had been sick herself. she
had pains in her back all the time, jadvyga explained, and feared
that she had womb trouble. it was not fit work for a woman, handling
fourteen-pound cans all day.

it was a striking circumstance that jonas, too, had gotten his job by
the misfortune of some other person. jonas pushed a truck loaded with
hams from the smoke rooms on to an elevator, and thence to the packing
rooms. the trucks were all of iron, and heavy, and they put about
threescore hams on each of them, a load of more than a quarter of a
ton. on the uneven floor it was a task for a man to start one of these
trucks, unless he was a giant; and when it was once started he naturally
tried his best to keep it going. there was always th

about, and if there was a second‚Äôs delay he would fall to cursing;
lithuanians and slovaks and such, who could not understand what was said
to them, the bosses were wont to kick about the place like so many
dogs. therefore these trucks went for the most part on the run; and the
predecessor of jonas had been jammed against the wall by one and crushed
in a horrible and nameless manner.

all of these were sinister incidents; but they were trifles compared to
what jurgis saw with his own eyes before long. one curious thing he
had noticed, the very first day, in his profession of shoveler of guts;
which was the sharp trick of the floor bosses whenever there chanced to
come a ‚Äúslunk‚Äù calf. any man who knows anything about butchering knows
that the flesh of a cow that is about to calve, or h

but the problem was to raise it even temporarily. they had been in the
neighborhood so short a time that they could not get much credit, and
there was no one except szedvilas from whom they could borrow even a
little. evening after evening jurgis and ona would sit and figure the
expenses, calculating the term of their separation. they could not
possibly manage it decently for less than two hundred dollars, and even
though they were welcome to count in the whole of the earnings of marija
and jonas, as a loan, they could not hope to raise this sum in less
than four or five months. so ona began thinking of seeking employment
herself, saying that if she had even ordinarily good luck, she might be
able to take two months off the time. they were just beginning to adjust
themselves to this necessity, when out of the clear sky there fell a
thunderbolt upon them--a calamity that scattered all their hopes to the
four winds.

about a block away from them there lived another lithuanian family,

taggering back through the snowdrifts with a bag of coal upon
his shoulder. home was not a very attractive place--at least not this
winter. they had only been able to buy one stove, and this was a small
one, and proved not big enough to warm even the kitchen in the bitterest
weather. this made it hard for teta elzbieta all day, and for the
children when they could not get to school. at night they would sit
huddled round this stove, while they ate their supper off their laps;
and then jurgis and jonas would smoke a pipe, after which they would all
crawl into their beds to get warm, after putting out the fire to save
the coal. then they would have some frightful experiences with the cold.
they would sleep with all their clothes on, including their overcoats,
and put over them all the bedding and spare clothing they owned; the
children would sleep all crowded into one bed, and yet even so they
could not keep warm. the outside ones would be shivering and sobbing,

day came, the packing houses posted a notice that men who desired to
vote might remain away until nine that morning, and the same night
watchman took jurgis and the rest of his flock into the back room of a
saloon, and showed each of them where and how to mark a ballot, and then
gave each two dollars, and took them to the polling place, where there
was a policeman on duty especially to see that they got through all
right. jurgis felt quite proud of this good luck till he got home and
met jonas, who had taken the leader aside and whispered to him, offering
to vote three times for four dollars, which offer had been accepted.

and now in the union jurgis met men who explained all this mystery
to him; and he learned that america differed from russia in that its
government existed under the form of a democracy. the officials who
ruled it, and got all the graft, had to be elected first; and so there
were two rival sets of grafters, known as political parties, and the one

th blood, and his hands steeped in it, how was he
ever to wipe his face, or to clear his eyes so that he could see? it was
stuff such as this that made the ‚Äúembalmed beef‚Äù that had killed
several times as many united states soldiers as all the bullets of the
spaniards; only the army beef, besides, was not fresh canned, it was old
stuff that had been lying for years in the cellars.

then one sunday evening, jurgis sat puffing his pipe by the kitchen
stove, and talking with an old fellow whom jonas had introduced, and
who worked in the canning rooms at durham‚Äôs; and so jurgis learned a few
things about the great and only durham canned goods, which had become
a national institution. they were regular alchemists at durham‚Äôs; they
advertised a mushroom-catsup, and the men who made it did not know what
a mushroom looked like. they advertised ‚Äúpotted chicken,‚Äù--and it was
like the boardinghouse soup of the comic papers, through which a chicken

r, this time to see if she had lost her place; but
fortunately about ten per cent of the working people of packingtown had
been depositors in that bank, and it was not convenient to discharge
that many at once. the cause of the panic had been the attempt of a
policeman to arrest a drunken man in a saloon next door, which had drawn
a crowd at the hour the people were on their way to work, and so started
the ‚Äúrun.‚Äù

about this time jurgis and ona also began a bank account. besides having
paid jonas and marija, they had almost paid for their furniture, and
could have that little sum to count on. so long as each of them could
bring home nine or ten dollars a week, they were able to get along
finely. also election day came round again, and jurgis made half a
week‚Äôs wages out of that, all net profit. it was a very close election
that year, and the echoes of the battle reached even to packingtown. the
two rival sets of grafters hired halls and set off fireworks and made
speeches, to try to g

dismay; when the rest came home at night she met them outside and told
them, and they, too, put on a cheerful face, saying it would only be for
a week or two, and that they would pull him through.

when they had gotten him to sleep, however, they sat by the kitchen fire
and talked it over in frightened whispers. they were in for a siege,
that was plainly to be seen. jurgis had only about sixty dollars in the
bank, and the slack season was upon them. both jonas and marija might
soon be earning no more than enough to pay their board, and besides that
there were only the wages of ona and the pittance of the little boy.
there was the rent to pay, and still some on the furniture; there was
the insurance just due, and every month there was sack after sack
of coal. it was january, midwinter, an awful time to have to face
privation. deep snows would come again, and who would carry ona to her
work now? she might lose her place--she was almost certain to lose

who were dear to him might lie and perish of starvation and cold, and
there would be no ear to hear their cry, no hand to help them! it was
true, it was true,--that here in this huge city, with its stores of
heaped-up wealth, human creatures might be hunted down and destroyed by
the wild-beast powers of nature, just as truly as ever they were in the
days of the cave men!

ona was now making about thirty dollars a month, and stanislovas about
thirteen. to add to this there was the board of jonas and marija,
about forty-five dollars. deducting from this the rent, interest,
and installments on the furniture, they had left sixty dollars, and
deducting the coal, they had fifty. they did without everything that
human beings could do without; they went in old and ragged clothing,
that left them at the mercy of the cold, and when the children‚Äôs shoes
wore out, they tied them up with string. half invalid as she was, ona
would do herself harm by walking in the rain and cold when she ought

ning. it transpired that he had twisted a tendon
out of place, and could never have gotten well without attention. then
he gripped the sides of the bed, and shut his teeth together, and turned
white with agony, while the doctor pulled and wrenched away at his
swollen ankle. when finally the doctor left, he told him that he would
have to lie quiet for two months, and that if he went to work before
that time he might lame himself for life.

three days later there came another heavy snowstorm, and jonas and
marija and ona and little stanislovas all set out together, an hour
before daybreak, to try to get to the yards. about noon the last two
came back, the boy screaming with pain. his fingers were all frosted,
it seemed. they had had to give up trying to get to the yards, and had
nearly perished in a drift. all that they knew how to do was to hold the
frozen fingers near the fire, and so little stanislovas spent most of
the day dancing about in horrible agony, till jurgis flew into a passion

it was better, he said, that he should not eat, it was a saving. about
the end of march he had got hold of ona‚Äôs bankbook, and learned that
there was only three dollars left to them in the world.

but perhaps the worst of the consequences of this long siege was that
they lost another member of their family; brother jonas disappeared. one
saturday night he did not come home, and thereafter all their efforts to
get trace of him were futile. it was said by the boss at durham‚Äôs that
he had gotten his week‚Äôs money and left there. that might not be true,
of course, for sometimes they would say that when a man had been killed;
it was the easiest way out of it for all concerned. when, for instance,
a man had fallen into one of the rendering tanks and had been made into
pure leaf lard and peerless fertilizer, there

was no use letting the
fact out and making his family unhappy. more probable, however, was
the theory that jonas had deserted them, and gone on the road, seeking
happiness. he had been discontented for a long time, and not without
some cause. he paid good board, and was yet obliged to live in a family
where nobody had enough to eat. and marija would keep giving them all
her money, and of course he could not but feel that he was called upon
to do the same. then there were crying brats, and all sorts of misery;
a man would have had to be a good deal of a hero to stand it all without

chapter 14


with one member trimming beef in a cannery, and another working in a
sausage factory, the family had a first-hand knowledge of the great
majority of packingtown swindles. for it was the custom, as they found,
whenever meat was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything
else, either to can it or else to chop it up into sausage. with what had
been told them by jonas, who had worked in the pickle rooms, they could
now study the whole of the spoiled-meat industry on the inside, and read
a new and grim meaning into that old packingtown jest--that they use
everything of the pig except the squeal.

jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would
often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away
the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all
the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving

scape from the horror--escape
for a while, come what would.

so there came a time when nearly all the conscious life of jurgis
consisted of a struggle with the craving for liquor. he would have ugly
moods, when he hated ona and the whole family, because they stood in his
way. he was a fool to have married; he had tied himself down, had made
himself a slave. it was all because he was a married man that he was
compelled to stay in the yards; if it had not been for that he might
have gone off like jonas, and to hell with the packers. there were few
single men in the fertilizer mill--and those few were working only for a
chance to escape. meantime, too, they had something to think about while
they worked,--they had the memory of the last time they had been drunk,
and the hope of the time when they would be drunk again. as for jurgis,
he was expected to bring home every penny; he could not even go with
the men at noontime--he was supposed to sit down and eat his dinner on a
pile of fertilizer du

ake, and pull himself together? in a little while they would
be out of danger--now that they had given up the house they could live
more cheaply, and with all the children working they could get along,
if only he would not go to pieces. so elzbieta went on, with feverish
intensity. it was a struggle for life with her; she was not afraid that
jurgis would go on drinking, for he had no money for that, but she was
wild with dread at the thought that he might desert them, might take to
the road, as jonas had done.

but with ona‚Äôs dead body beneath his eyes, jurgis could not well think
of treason to his child. yes, he said, he would try, for the sake of
antanas. he would give the little fellow his chance--would get to work
at once, yes, tomorrow, without even waiting for ona to be buried. they
might trust him, he would keep his word, come what might.

and so he was out before daylight the next morning, headache, heartache,
and all. he went straight to graham‚Äôs fertilizer mill, to see if he
