he are white, his eyes bright blue, his complexion that of a turkey. his lean figure is still erect and square-shouldered. he is stripped to the waist, his coat, shirt, undershirt, collar and tie crushed up into a pillow on the table in front of him, his head sideways on this pillow, facing front, his arms dangling toward the floor. on his lower left shoulder is the big ragged scar of an old wound.

at the table at right, front, harry hope, the proprietor, sits in the middle, facing front, with pat mcgloin on his right and ed mosher on his left, the other two chairs being unoccupied.

both mcgloin and mosher are big paunchy men. mcgloin has his old occupation of policeman stamped all over him. he is in his fifties, sandy-haired, bullet-headed, jowly, with protruding ears and little round eyes. his face must once have been brutal and greedy, but time and whiskey have melted it down into a good-humored, parasite's characterlessness. he wears old clothes and is slovenly. he is slumped sideways on hi

 market people across the street and the waterfront workers, so in spite of harry's thirst and his generous heart, he comes out even. he never worries in hard times because there's always old friends from the days when he was a jitney tammany politician, and a friendly brewery to tide him over. don't ask me what his two pals work at because they don't. except at being his lifetime guests. the one facing this way is his brother-in-law, ed mosher, who once worked for a circus in the ticket wagon. pat mcgloin, the other one, was a police lieutenant back in the flush times of graft when everything went. but he got too greedy and when the usual reform investigation came he was caught red-handed and thrown off the force.

willie--(jumps to his feet drunkenly and points a finger at mcgloin--imitating the manner of a cross-examiner--coldly) one moment, please. lieutenant mcgloin! are
