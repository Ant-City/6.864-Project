lay at a remote height under his waistcoat), the watch
was as a necessity pulled out by throwing the body to
one side, compressing the mouth and face to a mere
mass of ruddy flesh on account of the exertion, and
drawing up the watch by its chain, like a bucket from a
well.
but some thoughtfull persons, who had seen him
walking across one of his fields on a certain december
morning -- sunny and exceedingly mild -- might have
regarded gabriel oak in other aspects than these. in
his face one might notice that many of the hues and
curves of youth had tarried on to manhood: there even
remained in his remoter crannies some relics of the boy.
his height and breadth would have been sufficient to
make his presence imposing, had they been exhibited
with due consideration. but there is a way some men
have, rural and urban alike, for which the mind is more
responsible than flesh and sinew:  it is a way of curtail-

the change from the customary spot and necessary
occasion of such an act -- from the dressing hour in a
bedroom to a time of travelling out of doors -- lent to
the idle deed a novelty it did not intrinsically possess.
the picture was a delicate one. woman's prescriptive
infirmity had stalked into the sunlight, which had
clothed it in the freshness of an originality. a
cynical inference was irresistible by gabriel oak as he
regarded the scene, generous though he fain would have
been. there was no necessity whatever for her looking
in the glass. she did not adjust her hat, or pat her
hair, or press a dimple into shape, or do one thing to
signify that any such intention had been her motive in
taking up the glass. she simply observed herself as a
fair product of nature in the feminine kind, her thoughts
seeming to glide into far-off though likely dramas in
which men would play a part -- vistas of proba

small sheep farm of which norcombe hill was a portion,
and stock it with two hundred sheep. previously he
had been a bailiff for a short time, and earlier still a
shepherd only, having from his childhood assisted his
father in tending the flocks of large proprietors, till old
gabriel sank to rest.
this venture, unaided and alone, into the paths of
farming as master and not as man, with an advance of
sheep not yet paid for, was a critical juncture with
gabriel oak, and he recognised his position clearly.
the first movement in his new progress was the lambing
of his ewes, and sheep having been his speciality from
his "youth, he wisely refrained from deputing -- the task
of tending them at this season to a hireling or a novice.
the wind continued to beat-about the corners of the
hut, but the flute-playing ceased. a rectangular space
of light appeared in the side of the hut, and in the

it may have been observed that there is no regula

some people look upon marriage as a short cut that way,
but it has been known to fail. separation, which was
the means that chance offered to gabriel oak by
bathsheba's disappearance though effectual with people
of certain humours is apt to idealise the removed object
with others -- notably those whose affection, placid and
regular as it may be flows deep and long. oak belonged
to the even-tempered order of humanity, and felt the
secret fusion of himself in bathsheba to be burning with
a finer flame now that she was gone -- that was all.

"we thought we heard a hand pawing about the

"gabriel oak, that's my name, neighbours."
the ancient maltster sitting in the midst turned up
this -- his turning being as the turning of a rusty
crane.
"that's never gable oak's grandson over at nor-

surprise, which nobody was supposed to take literally'.
"my father and my grandfather were old men of the

enough to voluntarily disparage in a slight degree the
virtue of having lived a great many years, by mentioning
that the cup they were drinking out of was three years
older than he.
  while the cup was being examined, the end of
gabriel oak's flute became visible over his smock-frock

tired?"
  "neither drum nor trumpet have i heard since

  "that i will." said gabriel, pulling out his flute and

  bathsheba had so many reasons for uneasiness that
it seemed she did not think it worth while to dwell
upon any particular one. "do as i told you, then"
she said in conclusion, closing the casement.
  "ay, ay, mistress; we will." they replied, and moved
away.
  that night at coggan's, gabriel oak, beneath the
screen of closed eyelids, was busy with fancies, and full
of movement, like a river flowing rapidly under its ice.
night had always been the time at which he saw bath-
sheba most vividly, and through the slow hours of
shadow he tenderly regarded her image now. it is
rarely that the pleasures of the imagination will compen-
sate for the pain of sleeplessness, but they possibly did

 bathsheba paused, as if about to refuse a reply, but
the temptation to say yes, since it was really in her

her spleen at having been published as old.
  "a man wanted to once." she said, in a highly experi-

rose before her.

  "quite well, i thank you miss everdene." said
shepard oak from the doorpost. "if i don't, i'll
inquire." gabriel was rather staggered by the remark-
able coolness of her manner. certainly nobody without
previous information would have dreamt that oak and
the handsome woman before whom he stood had ever
been other than strangers. but perhaps her air was
the inevitable result of the social rise which had advanced
her from a cottage to a large house and fields. the

he saw boldwood's action. "though there is no name
i think it is for your shepherd."
boldwood looked then at the address --

"oh -- what a mistake! -- it is not mine. nor is it

better take it on to him -- gabriel oak -- and say i opened

at this moment, on the ridge, up against the blazing
sky, a figure was visible, like the black snuff in the
midst of a candle-flame. then it moved and began to
bustle about vigorously from place to place, carrying
square skeleton masses, which were riddled by the same
rays. a small figure on all fours followed behind. the
tall form was that of gabriel oak; the small one that
of george; the articles in course of transit were hurdles.

bathsheba's was an impulsive nature under a delibera-

in spirit, she often performed actions of the greatest
temerity with a manner of extreme discretion. many of
her thoughts were perfect syllogisms; unluckily they
always remained thoughts. only a few were irrational
assumptions; but, unfortunately, they were the ones
which most frequently grew into deeds.
  the next day to that of the declaration she found
gabriel oak at the bottom of her garden, grinding his
shears for the sheep-shearing. all the surrounding
cottages were more or less scenes of the same operation;
the scurr of whetting spread into the sky from all parts
of the village as from an armury previous to a campaign.

gabriel oak had ceased to feed the weatherbury
flock for about four-and-twenty hours, when on sunday
afternoon the elderly gentlemen joseph poorgrass,
matthew moon, fray, and half-a-dozen others, came
running up to the house of the mistress of the upper
farm.
 "whatever is the matter, men?" she said, meeting
them at the door just as she was coming out on her
way to church, and ceasing in a moment from the close
compression of her two red lips, with which she had
accompanied the exertion of pullin

travelled in the exercise of their calling, and do not re-

shearer, susan tall's husband the fifth, joseph poorgrass
the sixth, young cain ball as assistant-shearer, and
gabriel oak as general supervisor. none of these were
clothed to any extent worth mentioning, each appearing
to have hit in the matter of raiment the decent mean

of lineament, and a fixity of facial machinery in general,
proclaimed that serious work was the order of the day.

cudgel he carried in his hand. he remembered it was
past ten o'clock. it seemed worth while to be civil to
boldwood.
"very well, i'll listen with pleasure." said troy,
placing his bag on the ground, "only speak low, for
somebody or other may overhear us in the farmhouse
there."
"well then -- i know a good deal concerning your
fanny robin's attachment to you. i may say, too, that
i believe i am the only person in the village, excepting
gabriel oak, who does know it. you ought to marry
her."
"i suppose i ought. indeed, l wish to, but i
cannot."
"why?"
troy was about to utter something hastily; he then
checked himself and said, "i am too poor." his voice
was changed. previously it had had a devil-may-care
tone. it was the voice of a trickster now.
boldwood's present mood was not critical enough to
notice tones. he continued, "i may as well speak
plainly; and understand, i don't wish to enter into the
questions of right or wrong

spread into the healthy air, and the wan blue of the
heaven was here and there coated with thin webs of
incorporeal cloud which were of no effect in obscuring
day. all the lights in the scene were yellow as to
colour, and all the shadows were attenuated as to form.
the creeping plants about the old manor-house were
bowed with rows of heavy water drops, which had upon
objects behind them the effect of minute lenses of high
magnifying power.
just before the clock struck five gabriel oak and
coggan passed the village cross, and went on together
to the fields. they were yet barely in view of their
mistress's house, when oak fancied he saw the opening
of a casement in one of the upper windows. the two
men were at this moment partially screened by an elder
bush, now beginning to be enriched with black bunches
of fruit, and they paused before emerging from its
shade.

susan to open it; but nobody stirred. he went round
to the back door, which had been left unfastened for
laban's entry, and passed in to the foot of the stair-
case.
"mrs. tall, i've come for the key of the granary,
to get at the rick-cloths." said oak, in a stentorian
voice.
"is that you?" said mrs. susan tall, half awake.
"yes." said gabriel.
"come along to bed, do, you drawlatching rogue --

and driven off to casterbridge with the gig and poppet.
after breakfast she was cool and collected -- quite
herself in fact -- and she rambled to the gate, intending
to walk to another quarter of the farm, which she still
personally superintended as well as her duties in the
house would permit, continually, however, finding her-
self preceded in forethought by gabriel oak, for whom
she began to entertain the genuine friendship of a sister.
of course, she sometimes thought of him in the light of
an old lover, and had momentary imaginings of what
life with him as a husband would have been like; also
of life with boldwood under the same conditions. but
bathsheba, though she could feel, was not much given
to futile dreaming, and her musings under this head
were short and entirely confined to the times when
troy's neglect was more than ordinarily evident.

he saw coming up the road a man like mr. boldwood.
it was mr. boldwood. bathsheba blushed painfully,
and watched. the farmer stopped when still a long
way off, and held up his hand to gabriel oak, who was
in a footpath across the field. the two men then
approached each other and seemed to engage in
earnest conversation.
thus they continued for a long time. joseph poor-
grass now passed near them, wheeling a barrow of apples
up the hill to bathsheba's residence. boldwood and
gabriel called to him, spoke to him for a few minutes,
and then all three parted, joseph immediately coming
up the hill with his barrow.

themselves had never before noticed so perfect an

that the waggon was standing into which gabriel oak
crept on his first journey to weatherbury; but, owing
to the darkness, the sign and the inn had been un-

the manners of the inn were of the old-established

existed as unalterable formulae:  e.g. --

for tobacco, shout.

the longer joseph poorgrass remained, the less his
spirit was troubled by the duties which devolved upon
him this afternoon. the minutes glided by uncounted,
until the evening shades began perceptibly to deepen,
and the eyes of the three were but sparkling points
on the surface of darkness. coggan's repeater struck
six from his pocket in the usual still small tones.
at that moment hasty steps were heard in the entry,
and the door opened to admit the figure of gabriel oak,
followed by the maid of the inn bearing a candle. he
stared sternly at the one lengthy and two round faces
of the sitters, which confronted him with the expressions
of a fiddle and a couple of warming-pans. joseph poor-
grass blinked, and shrank several inches into the back-
ground.
"upon my soul, i'm ashamed of you; 'tis disgraceful,

deeply troubled at the wretchedly ironical aspect that
circumstances were putting on with regard to troy's

lesson which oak showed a mastery of by every turn

by which he was surrounded, those which affected his
personal wellbeing were not the most absorbing and
important in his eyes. oak meditatively looked upon

, only
speaking to oak, who was the go-between throughout.
all was harmoniously arranged at last, and we now
see oak mounted on a strong cob, and daily trotting
the length breadth of about two thousand acres
in a cheerful spirit of surveillance, as if the crops
belonged to him -- the actual mistress of the one-half
and the master of the other, sitting in their respective
homes in gloomy and sad seclusion.
out of this there arose, during the spring succeeding,
a talk in the parish that gabriel oak was feathering his
nest fast.
"whatever d'ye think." said susan tall," gable oak
is coming it quite the dand. he now wears shining
boots with hardly a hob in 'em, two or three times
a-week, and a tall hat a-sundays, and 'a hardly knows
the name of smockfrock. when i see people strut
enough to he cut up into bantam cocks, i stand
dormant with wonder, and says no more!"
it was eventually known that gabriel, though paid
a fixed wage by bathsheba independent of the fluctua-
tions of agri
