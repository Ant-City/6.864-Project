King Henry VI - 
      King of England and various regions in France. Henry is son of Henry V, a great warrior who won many lands in France, and it has been prophesized that this son will lose the lands his father won. Henry faces great difficulty with his advisors and nobles, many of whom are involved in arguments with each other. Although young and inexperienced, he realizes what damage may be reaped by such dissention among the lords. He marries a French earl's daughter, Margaret, on the advice of Suffolk, though she does not symbolize a politically advantageous match.
