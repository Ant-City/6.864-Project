with such an agony, he sweat extreamly,
and somthing spoke in choller, ill, and hasty:
but he fell to himselfe againe, and sweetly,
in all the rest shew'd a most noble patience

   2. i doe not thinke he feares death

   1. sure he does not,
he neuer was so womanish, the cause
he may a little grieue at

   2. certainly,
the cardinall is the end of this

   1. tis likely,
by all coniectures: first kildares attendure;
then deputy of ireland, who remou'd
earle surrey, was sent thither, and in hast too,
least he should helpe his father

   2. that tricke of state
was a deepe enuious one,
  1. at his returne,
no doubt he will requite it; this is noted
(and generally) who euer the king fauours,
the cardnall instantly will finde imployment,
and farre enough from court too

   2. all the commons
hate him perniciously, and o' my conscience
wish him ten faddom deepe: this duke as much
they loue and doate on: call him bounteous buckingham,
the mirror
