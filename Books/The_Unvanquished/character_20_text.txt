re we saw the crowd of niggers kind of huddled beyond the hotel door
with six or eight strange white men herding them, and then all of a sudden i saw the
jefferson men, the men that i knew, that father knew, running across the square toward
the hotel with each one holding his hip like a man runs with a pistol in his pocket. and then
i saw the men who were father's troop lined up before the hotel door, blocking it off. and
then i was sliding off my horse too and watching drusilla struggling with george wyatt. but
he didn't have hold of her, he just had hold of the cloak, and then she was through the line
of them and running toward the hotel with her wreath on one side of her head and the
veil streaming behind. but george held me. he threw the cloak down and held me. "let
go," i said. "father."

r. they set the box on the sawchunk where louvinia washed, and ringo got the
pokeberry juice and an old piece of window shade, and they cut it into ballots. "let all
who want the honorable cassius q. benbow to be marshal of jefferson write yes on his
ballot; opposed, no," father said.
"and i'll do the writing and save some more time," george wyatt said. so he made

a pack of the ballots and wrote them against his saddle and fast as he would write them
the men would take them and drop them into the box and drusilla would call their names
out. we could hear aunt louisa still crying inside the cabin and we could see the other
ladies watching us through the window. it didn't take long. "you needn't bother to count
them," george said. "they all voted no."

 had ridden in man's clothes and
with her hair cut short like any other member of father's troop, across georgia and both
carolinas in front of sherman's army) for her to gather sprigs of verbena from to wear in her
hair because she said verbena was the only scent you could smell above the smell of
horses and courage and so it was the only one that was worth the wearing. the railroad
was hardly begun then and father and mr. redmond were not only still partners, they
were still friends, which as george wyatt said was easily a record for father, and he would
leave the house at daybreak on jupiter, riding up and down the unfinished line with two
saddlebags of gold coins borrowed on friday to pay the men on saturday, keeping just
two cross-ties ahead of the sheriff as aunt jenny said. so we walked in the dusk, slowly
between aunt jenny's flower beds while drusilla (in a dress now, who still would have worn
pants all the time if father had let her) leaned lightly on my arm and i smelled the verbena

e would have forgotten they
were ever partners if it hadn't been for the enmity between them. there had been a third
partner but nobody hardly remembered his name now; he and his name both had
vanished in the fury of the conflict which set up between father and redmond almost
before they began to lay the rails, between father's violent and ruthless dictatorialness
and will to dominate (the idea was his; he did think of the railroad first and then took
redmond in) and that quality in redmond (as george wyatt said, he was not a coward or
father would never have teamed with him) which permitted him to stand as much as he
did from father, to bear and bear and bear until something (not his will nor his courage)
broke in him. during the war redmond had not been a soldier, he had had something to
do with cotton for the government; he could have made money himself out of it but he
had not and everybody knew he had not, father knew it, yet father would even taunt him
with not having smelled powder. he was

engraved on it; and last summer the first train ran into jefferson, the engine decorated
with flowers and father in the cab blowing blast after blast on the whistle when he passed
redmond's house; and there were speeches at the station, with more flowers and a
confederate flag and girls in white dresses and red sashes and a band, and father stood
on the pilot of the engine and made a direct and absolutely needless allusion to mr.
redmond. that was it. he wouldn't let him alone. george wyatt came to me right
afterward and told me. "right or wrong," he said, "us boys and most of the other folks in this
county know john's right. but he ought to let redmond alone. i know what's wrong: he's
had to kill too many folks, and that's bad for a man. we all know colonel's brave as a lion,
but redmond ain't no coward either and there ain't any use in making a brave man that
made one mistake eat crow all the time. can't you talk to him?"

and he would have listened, but he could not have heard

 i mounted the steps toward
the figure straight and yellow and immobile as a candle which moved only to extend one
hand; we stood together and looked down at them where they stood clumped, the
horses too gathered in a tight group beyond them at the rim of light from the brilliant door
and windows. one of them stamped and blew his breath and jangled his gear.

"thank you, gentlemen," i said. "my aunt and my--drusilla thank you. there's no need
for you to stay. goodnight." they murmured, turning. george wyatt paused, looking back
at me.

sleep, anyone already asleep in it whom they could have wakened. then they were gone
and drusilla and i turned and crossed the portico, her hand lying light on my wrist yet
discharging into me with a shock like electricity that dark and passionate voracity, the
face at my shoulder--the jagged hair with a verbena sprig above each ear, the eyes
staring at me with that fierce exal

here and i knew soon that i would begin to pant. i could feel it
beginning like you feel regurgitation beginning, as though there were not enough air in the
room, the house, not enough air anywhere under the heavy hot low sky where the equinox
couldn't seem to accomplish, nothing in the air for breathing, for the lungs. now it was
aunt jenny who said "bayard" twice before i heard her. "you are not going to try to kill him.

be him, bayard, because he's dead now. and don't let it be george wyatt and those
others who will be waiting for you tomorrow morning. i know you are not afraid."

"yes. all right. don't let it be drusilla, a poor hysterical young woman. and don't let it

"louvinia!" aunt jenny said. they both came to her. louvinia touched and held her

outline of it inside his shirt, probably the one we had taken from grumby that day we killed
him,



now and i could smell nothing except the verbena in my coat, as if it had gathered all the
sun, all the suspended fierce heat in which the equinox could not seem to occur and were
distilling it so that i moved in a cloud of verbena as i might have moved in a cloud of
smoke from a cigar. then george wyatt was beside me (i don't know where he came
from) and five or six others of father's old troop a few yards behind, george's hand on my
arm, drawing me into a doorway out of the avid eyes like caught breaths.



colonel ever handle one right; i never could. so you take this. i tried it this morning and i
know it's right. here." he was already fumbling the pistol into my pocket, then the same
thing seemed to happen to him that happened to drusilla last night when she kissed my
hand--something commu

nd rose, with a queer ducking motion of his head; with his head still ducked aside and
one arm extended as though he couldn't see and the other hand resting on the desk as if
he couldn't stand alone, he turned and crossed to the wall and took his hat from the rack
and with his head still ducked aside and one hand extended he blundered along the wall
and passed me and reached the door and went through it. he was brave; no one denied
that. he walked down their stairs and out onto the street where george wyatt and the
other six of father's old troop waited and where the other men had begun to run now; he
walked through the middle of them with his hat on and his head up (they told me how
someone shouted at him: "have you killed that boy too?"), saying no word, staring straight
ahead and with his back to them, on to the station where the south-bound train was just in
and got on it with no baggage, nothing, and went away from jefferson and from
mississippi and never came back.

forehead. then i raised my head; the little room was full of men. "my god!" george wyatt
cried. "you took the pistol away from him and then missed him, missed him twice?" then he
answered himself--that same rapport for violence which drusilla had and which in
george's case was actual character judgment: "no; wait. you walked in here without
even a pocket knife and let him miss you twice. my god in heaven." he turned, shouting:
"get to hell out of here! you, white, ride out to sartoris and tell his folks it's all over and he's
all right. ride!" so they departed, went away; presently
