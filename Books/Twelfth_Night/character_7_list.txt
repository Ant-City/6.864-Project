Maria - 
                	Olivia's
clever, daring young waiting-gentlewoman. Maria is remarkably similar
to her antagonist, Malvolio, who harbors aspirations of rising in
the world through marriage. But Maria succeeds where Malvolio fails--perhaps
because she is a woman, but, more likely, because she is more in
tune than Malvolio with the anarchic, topsy-turvy spirit that animates
the play.
