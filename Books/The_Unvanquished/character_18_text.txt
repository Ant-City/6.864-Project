drusilla in the torn wedding dress and the crooked wreath and veil standing beside the
sawchunk, watching them. only this time even father could not have stopped them. it
came back high and thin and ragged and fierce, like when the yankees used to hear it
out of the smoke and the galloping: "yaaaaay, drusilla!" they hollered. "yaaaaaay, john
sartoris! yaaaaaaay!"


an odor of verbena

it was just after supper. i had just opened my coke on the table beneath the lamp; i
heard professor wilkins' feet in the hall and then the instant of silence as he put his hand to
the door knob, and i should have known. people talk glibly of presentiment, but i had
none. i heard his feet on the stairs and then in the hall approaching and there was nothing
in the feet because although i had lived in his house for three college years now and
although both he and mrs. wilkins called me bayard in the house, he would no more have
entered my room without knocking than i would have entered his--or hers. the

the door violently inward against the doorstop with one of those gestures with or by which
an almost painfully unflagging preceptory of youth ultimately aberrates, and stood there
saying, "bayard. bayard, my son, my dear son."

because i remember how i closed the book carefully, even marking the place, before i
rose. he (professor wilkins) was doing something, bustling at something; it was my hat and
cloak which he handed me and which i took although i would not need the cloak, unless
even then i was thinking (although it was october, the equinox had not occurred) that the
rains and the cool weather would arrive before i should see this room again and so i would
need the cloak anyway to return to it if i returned, thinking 'god, if he had only done this

stable when i get my mare." good for me, because even before i finished speaking i knew
that would not be necessary either, that ringo would have stopped at the livery stable
before he came out to the college and attended to that and that the fresh horse for him
and my mare both would be saddled and waiting now at the side fence and we would
not have to go through oxford at all. loosh would not have thought of that if he had
come for me, he would have come straight to the college, to professor wilkins', and told his
news and then sat down and let me take charge from then on. but not ringo.

thick dusty darkness quick and strained for the overdue equinox like a laboring delayed
woman, he would be somewhere either just beside me or just behind me and i never to
know exactly nor care which. he was trying to find the words with which to offer me his
pistol too. i could almost hear him: "ah, this unhappy land; not ten years recovered from
the fever yet still men must kill one another, still we mu

 she had known granny--a lifted anxious still face which was thinking who
lives by the sword shall die by it just as granny would have thought, toward which i
walked, had to walk not because i was granny's grandson and had lived in her house for
three college years and was about the age of her son when he was killed in almost the last
battle nine years ago, but because i was now the sartoris (the sartoris: that had been one
of the concomitant flashes, along with the at last it has happened when professor wilkins
opened my door.) she didn't offer me a horse and pistol, not because she liked me any
less than professor wilkins but because she was a woman and so wiser than any man, else
the men would not have gone on with the war for two years after they knew they were
whipped. she just put her hands (a small woman, no bigger than granny had been) on my
shoulders and said, "give my love to drusilla and your aunt jenny. and come back when
you can."

i still had no yardstick to measure save that one consisting of what, despite
myself, despite my raising and background (or maybe because of them) i had for some
time known i was becoming and had feared the test of it; i remember how i thought while
her hands still rested on my shoulders: at least this will be my chance to find out if i am
what i think i am or if i just hope; if i am going to do what i have taught myself is right or if i
am just going to wish i were.

we went on to the kitchen, professor wilkins still somewhere beside or behind me
and still offering me the pistol and horse in a dozen different ways. ringo was waiting; i
remember how i thought then that no matter what might happen to either of us, i would
never be the sartoris to him. he was twenty-four too, but in a way he had changed even
less than i had since that day when we had nailed grumby's body to the door of the old
compress. maybe it was because he had outgrown me, had changed so much that
summer while he and granny traded mu

the cold stove, spent-looking too who had ridden forty miles (at one time, either in
jefferson or when he was alone at last on the road somewhere, he had cried; dust was
now caked and dried in the tear-channels on his face) and would ride forty more yet
would not eat, looking up at me a little red-eyed with weariness (or maybe it was more
than just weariness and so i would never catch up with him) then rising without a word and

ringo had the two horses saddled at the side gate, as i had known he would--the

fresh one for himself and my mare father had given me three years ago, that could do a
mile under two minutes any day and a mile every eight minutes all day long. he was
already mounted when i realised that what professor wilkins wanted was to shake my
hand. we shook ha
