[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER] is, like all the legacy hunters, named after a carrion-bird. in the case of [CHARACTER], that bird is the vulture; for corvino, it is the crow, and for corbaccio, the raven. [CHARACTER] is the most pleasant of all the legacy hunters, for he is the least crass and the least obsessed with seeing volpone die. his preferential status shows in mosca's special regard for him: mosca tries to make sure that [CHARACTER] gets enough payment for his services at the scrutineo in act iv. but [CHARACTER] comes to regret his actions at the scrutineo. of course, this regret only comes after he has been denied his inheritance, and it seems to stem directly from his resentment at mosca's leapfrogging over him on the social ladder. and when volpone whispers to him that he might still get his inheritance, he stops confessing his lies to the scrutineo and pretends that he was "possessed" by an evil demon. the verbal irony is that [CHARACTER], in that statement and action, reveals his greed.
