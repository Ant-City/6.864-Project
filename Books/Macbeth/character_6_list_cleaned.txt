[CHARACTER] - 
                the
son of duncan, whose restoration to the throne signals scotland's
return to order following macbeth's reign of terror. [CHARACTER] becomes
a serious challenge to macbeth with macduff's aid (and the support
of england). prior to this, he appears weak and uncertain of his
own power, as when he and donalbain flee scotland after their father's
murder.
