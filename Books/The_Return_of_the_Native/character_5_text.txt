â€œthe next thing is for us to go and wish â€˜em joy, i suppose?â€
â€œwell, no.â€
â€œno? now, i thought we must. i must, or â€˜twould be very unlike meâ€”the first in every spree thatâ€™s going!

i met misâ€™ess yeobright, the young brideâ€™s aunt, last night, and she told me that her son clym was coming home aâ€™ christmas. wonderful clever, â€˜a believeâ€”ah, i should like to have all thatâ€™s under that young manâ€™s hair. well, then, i spoke to her in my well-known merry way, and she said, â€˜o that whatâ€™s shaped so venerable should talk like a fool!â€™â€”thatâ€™s what she said to me. i donâ€™t care for her, be jowned if i do, and so i told her. â€˜be jowned if i care for â€˜ee,â€™ i said. i had her thereâ

, timothy, hearken to me,â€ said the grandfer earnestly. â€œthough known as such a joker, i be an understanding man if you catch me serious, and i am serious now. i can tell â€˜ee lots about the married couple. yes, this morning at six oâ€™clock they went up the country to do the job, and neither vell nor mark have been seen of â€˜em since, though i reckon that this afternoon has brought â€˜em home again man and womanâ€”wife, that is. isnâ€™t it spoke like a man, timothy, and wasnâ€™t misâ€™ess yeobright wrong about me?â€
â€œyes, it will do. i didnâ€™t know the two had walked together since last fall, when her aunt forbad the banns. how long has this new set-to been in mangling then? do you know, humphrey?â€
â€œyes, how long?â€ said grandfer cantle smartly, likewise turning to humphrey. â€œi ask that question.â€
â€œever since her aunt altered her mind, and said she might have the man after all,â€ replied humphrey, without removing his eyes from the fire. he was a somewhat solemn young fell

â€œexactlyâ€”seem foolish-like; and thatâ€™s very bad for the poor things that be so, though i only guess as much, to be sure,â€ said grandfer cantle, still strenuously preserving a sensible bearing and mien.
â€œah, well, i was at church that day,â€ said fairway, â€œwhich was a very curious thing to happen.â€
â€œif â€˜twasnâ€™t my nameâ€™s simple,â€ said the grandfer emphatically. â€œi haâ

â€œi haâ€™nâ€™t been these three years,â€ said humphrey; â€œfor iâ€™m so dead sleepy of a sunday; and â€˜tis so terrible far to get there; and when you do get there â€˜tis such a mortal poor chance that youâ€™ll be chose for up above, when so many bainâ€™t, that i bide at home and donâ€™t go at all.â€
â€œi not only happened to be there,â€ said fairway, with a fresh collection of emphasis, â€œbut i was sitting in the same pew as misâ€™ess yeobright. and though you may not see it as such, it fairly made my blood run cold to hear her. yes, it is a curious thing; but it made my blood run cold, for i was close at her elbow.â€ the speaker looked round upon the bystanders, now drawing closer to hear him, with his lips gathered tighter than ever in the rigorousness of his descriptive moderation.
â€œâ€˜tis a serious job to have things happen to â€˜ee there,â€ said a woman behind.

â€œso â€˜twould, neighbour fairway.â€
â€œâ€˜be damned if there isnâ€™t misâ€™ess yeobright a-standing up,â€™ i said,â€ the narrator repeated, giving out the bad word with the same passionless severity

these deeds were urgent, but to give themselves time to weigh the moral of the story.
â€œiâ€™m sure when i heard theyâ€™d been forbid i felt as glad as if anybody had gied me sixpence,â€ said an earnest voiceâ€”that of olly dowden, a woman who lived by making heath brooms, or besoms. her nature was to be civil to enemies as well as to friends, and grateful to all the world for letting her remain alive.
â€œand now the maid have married him just the same,â€ said humphrey.
â€œafter that misâ€™ess yeobright came round and was quite agreeable,â€ fairway resumed, with an unheeding air, to show that his words were no appendage to humphreyâ€™s, but the result of independent reflection.
â€œsupposing they were ashamed, i donâ€™t see why they shouldnâ€™t have done it here-right,â€ said a wide-spread woman whose stays creaked like shoes whenever she stooped or turned. â€œâ€˜tis well to call the neighbours together and to hae a good racket once now and then; and it may as well be when thereâ€™s a wedding

â€œah, now, youâ€™d hardly believe it, but i donâ€™t care for gay weddings,â€ said timothy fairway, his eyes again travelling round. â€œi hardly blame thomasin yeobright and neighbour wildeve for doing it quiet, if i must own it. a wedding at home means five and six-handed reels by the hour; and they do a manâ€™s legs no good when heâ€™s over forty.â€
â€œtrue. once at the womanâ€™s house you can hardly say nay to being one in a jig, knowing all the time that you be expected to make yourself worth your victuals.â€

â€œnine folks out of ten would own â€˜twas going too far to dance then, i suppose?â€ suggested grandfer cantle.
â€œâ€˜tis the only sort of party a staid man can feel safe at after the mug have been round a few times.â€
â€œwell, i canâ€™t understand a quiet ladylike little body like tamsin yeobright caring to be married in such a mean way,â€ said susan nunsuch, the wide woman, who preferred the original subject. â€œâ€˜tis worse than the poorest do. and i shouldnâ€™t have cared about the man, though some may say heâ€™s good-looking.â€
â€œto give him his due heâ€™s a clever, learned fellow in his wayâ€”aâ€™most as clever as clym yeobright used to be. he was brought up to better things than keeping the quiet woman. an engineerâ€”thatâ€™s what the man was, as we know; but he threw away his c

â€œwildeve is older than tamsin yeobright by a good-few summers. a pretty maid too she is. a young woman with a home must be a fool to tear her smock for a man like that.â€
the speaker, a peat- or turf-cutter, who had newly joined the group, carried across his shoulder the singular heart-shaped spade of large dimensions used in that species of labour, and its well-whetted edge gleamed like a silver bow in the beams of the fire.
â€œa hundred maidens would have had him if heâ€™d asked â€˜em,â€ said the wide woman.

â€œhold your tongue. what is it?â€ said fairway.
â€œhoi-i-i-i!â€ cried a voice from the darkness.
â€œhalloo-o-o-o!â€ said fairway.
â€œis there any cart track up across here to misâ€™ess yeobrightâ€™s, of blooms-end?â€ came to them in the same voice, as a long, slim indistinct figure approached the barrow.
â€œought we not to run home as hard as we can, neighbours, as â€˜tis getting late?â€ said christian. â€œnot run away from one another, you know; run close together, i mean.â€
â€œscrape up a few stray locks of furze, and make a blaze, so that we can see who the man is,â€ said fairway.
when the flame arose it revealed a young man in tight raiment, and red from top to toe. â€œis there

nets, their atmospheres along with them in their orbits; and the matron who entered now upon the scene could, and usually did, bring her own tone into a company. her normal manner among the heathfolk had that reticence which results from the consciousness of superior communicative power. but the effect of coming into society and light after lonely wandering in darkness is a sociability in the comer above its usual pitch, expressed in the features even more than in words.
â€œwhy, â€˜tis misâ€™ess yeobright,â€ said fairway. â€œmisâ€™ess yeobright, not ten minutes ago a man was here asking for youâ€”a reddleman.â€
â€œwhat did he want?â€ said she.
â€œhe didnâ€™t tell us.â€
â€œsomething to sell, i suppose; what it can be i am at a loss to understand.â€
â€œi am glad to hear that your son mr. clym is coming home at christmas, maâ€™am,â€ said sam, the turf-cutter. â€œwhat a dog he used to be for bonfires!â€
â€œyes. i believe he is coming,â€ she said.
â€œhe must be a fine fellow by this time,â€

â€œhe is a man now,â€ she replied quietly.
â€œâ€˜tis very lonesome for â€˜ee in the heth tonight, misâ€™ess,â€ said christian, coming from the seclusion he had hitherto maintained. â€œmind you donâ€™t get lost. egdon heth is a bad place to get lost in, and the winds do huffle queerer tonight than ever i heard â€˜em afore. them that know egdon best have been pixy-led here at times.â€
â€œis that you, christian?â€ said mrs. yeobright. â€œwhat made you hide away from me?â€
â€œâ€˜twas that i didnâ€™t know you in this light, misâ€™ess; and being a man of the mournfullest make, i was scared a little, thatâ€™s all. oftentimes if you could see how terrible down i get in my mind, â€˜twould make â€˜ee quite nervous for fear i should die by my hand.â€

â€œnow, grandfer,â€ said timothy fairway, â€œwe are ashamed of ye. a reverent old patriarch man as you beâ€”seventy if a dayâ€”to go hornpiping like that by yourself!â€
â€œa harrowing old man, misâ€™ess yeobright,â€ said christian despondingly. â€œi wouldnâ€™t live with him a week, so playward as he is, if i could get away.â€
â€œâ€˜twould be more seemly in ye to stand still and welcome misâ€™ess yeobright, and you the venerablest here, grandfer cantle,â€ said the besom-woman.
â€œfaith, and so it would,â€ said the reveller checking himself repentantly. â€œiâ€™ve such a bad memory, misâ€™ess yeobright, that i forget how iâ€™m looked up to by the rest of â€˜em. my spirits must be wonderful good, youâ€™ll say? but not always. â€˜tis a weight upon a man to be looked up to as commander, and i often feel it.â€
â€œi am sorry to stop the talk,â€ said mrs. yeobright. â€œbut i must be leaving you now.

â€œay, sure, maâ€™am, iâ€™m just thinking of moving,â€ said olly.
â€œwhy, youâ€™ll be safe to meet the reddleman that i told ye of,â€ said fairway. â€œheâ€™s only gone back to get his van. we heard that your niece and her husband were coming straight home as soon as they were married, and we are going down there shortly, to give â€˜em a song oâ€™ welcome.â€
â€œthank you indeed,â€ said mrs. yeobright.
â€œbut we shall take a shorter cut through the furze than you can go with long clothes; so we wonâ€™t trouble you to wait.â€
â€œvery wellâ€”are you ready, olly?â€
â€œyes, maâ€™am. and thereâ€™s a light shining from your nieceâ€™s window, see. it will help to keep us in the path.â€
she indicated the faint light at the bottom of the valley which fairway had pointed out; and the two women descended the tumulus.

wnâ€”their descent at each step seeming to outmeasure their advance. their skirts were scratched noisily by the furze, their shoulders brushed by the ferns, which, though dead and dry, stood erect as when alive, no sufficient winter weather having as yet arrived to beat them down. their tartarean situation might by some have been called an imprudent one for two unattended women. but these shaggy recesses were at all seasons a familiar surrounding to olly and mrs. yeobright; and the addition of darkness lends no frightfulness to the face of a friend.
â€œand so tamsin has married him at last,â€ said olly, when the incline had become so much less steep that their foot-steps no longer required undivided attention.
mrs. yeobright answered slowly, â€œyes; at last.â€
â€œhow you will miss herâ€”living with â€˜ee as a daughter, as she always have.â€
â€œi do miss her.â€

â€œyou were not more struck by it than i should have been last year this time, olly. there are a good many sides to that wedding. i could not tell you all of them, even if i tried.â€

â€œit cannot,â€ said mrs. yeobright. â€œsee, hereâ€™s the wagon-track at last. now we shall get along better.â€
the wedding subject was no further dwelt upon; and soon a faint diverging path was reached, where they parted company, olly first begging her companion to remind mr. wildeve that he had not sent her sick husband the bottle of wine promised on the occasion of his marriage. the besom-maker turned to the left towards her own house, behind a spur of the hill, and mrs. yeobright followed the straight track, which further on

she supposed her niece to have returned with wildeve from their wedding at anglebury that day.
she first reached wildeveâ€™s patch, as it was called, a plot of land redeemed from the heath, and after long and laborious years brought into cultivation. the man who had discovered that it could be tilled died of the labour; the man who succeeded him in possession ruined himself in fertilizing it. wildeve came like amerigo vespucci, and received the honours due to those who had gone before.
when mrs. yeobright had drawn near to the inn, and was about to enter, she saw a horse and vehicle some two hundred yards beyond it, coming towards her, a man walking alongside with a lantern in his hand. it was soon evident that this was the reddleman who had inquired for her. instead of entering the inn at once, she walked by it and towards the van.
the conveyance came close, and the man was about to pass her with little notice, when she turned to him and said, â€œi think you have been inquiring for me? i am mrs

the reddleman started, and held up his finger. he stopped the horses, and beckoned to her to withdraw with him a few yards aside, which she did, wondering.
â€œyou donâ€™t know me, maâ€™am, i suppose?â€ he said.
â€œi do not,â€ said she. â€œwhy, yes, i do! you are young vennâ€”your father was a dairyman somewhere here?â€

â€œsheâ€™s not there.â€
â€œhow do you know?â€
â€œbecause sheâ€™s here. sheâ€™s in my van,â€ he added slowly.
â€œwhat new trouble has come?â€ murmured mrs. yeobright, putting her hand over her eyes.
â€œi canâ€™t explain much, maâ€™am. all i know is that, as i was going along the road this morning, about a mile out of anglebury, i heard something trotting after me like a doe, and looking round there she was, white as death itself. â€˜oh, diggory venn!â€™ she said, â€˜i thought â€˜twas youâ€”will you help me? i am in trouble.â€™â€
â€œhow did she know your christian name?â€ said mrs. yeobright doubtingly.

â€œlet me see her at once,â€ said mrs. yeobright, hastening towards the van.
the reddleman followed with the lantern, and, stepping up first, assisted mrs. yeobright to mount beside him. on the door being opened she perceived at the end of the van an extemporized couch, around which was hung apparently all the drapery that the reddleman possessed, to keep the occupant of the little couch from contact with the red materials of his trade. a young girl lay thereon, covered with a cloak. she was asleep, and the light of the lantern fell upon her

en a dignity to what it might eventually undermine. the scarlet of her lips had not had time to abate, and just now it appeared still more intense by the absence of the neighbouring and more transient colour of her cheek. the lips frequently parted, with a murmur of words. she seemed to belong rightly to a madrigalâ€”to require viewing through rhyme and harmony.
one thing at least was obvious: she was not made to be looked at thus. the reddleman had appeared conscious of as much, and, while mrs. yeobright looked in upon her, he cast his eyes aside with a delicacy which well became him. the sleeper apparently thought so too, for the next moment she opened her own.
the lips then parted with something of anticipation, something more of doubt; and her several thoughts and fractions of thoughts, as signalled by the changes on her face, were exhibited by the light to the utmost nicety. an ingenuous, transparent life was disclosed, as if the flow of her existence could be seen passing within her. she u

thomasin was now on the verge of a sob, but by an unexpected self-command she uttered no sound. with a gentle panting breath she sat upright.
â€œi did not expect to see you in this state, any more than you me,â€ she went on quickly. â€œwhere am i, aunt?â€
â€œnearly home, my dear. in egdon bottom. what dreadful thing is it?â€

â€œwhy should you think it necessary to ask me? i will, of course,â€ said he.
â€œhe is indeed kind,â€ murmured thomasin. â€œi was once acquainted with him, aunt, and when i saw him today i thought i should prefer his van to any conveyance of a stranger. but iâ€™ll walk now. reddleman, stop the horses, please.â€
the man regarded her with tender reluctance, but stopped them
aunt and niece then descended from the van, mrs. yeobright saying to its owner, â€œi quite recognize you now. what made you change from the nice business your father left you?â€
â€œwell, i did,â€ he said, and looked at thomasin, who blushed a little. â€œthen youâ€™ll not be wanting me any more tonight, maâ€™am?â€
mrs. yeobright glanced around at the dark sky, at the hills, at the perishing bonfires, and at the lighted window of the inn they had neared. â€œi think not,â€ she said, â€œsince thomasin wishes to walk. we can soon run up the path and rea

and after a few further words they parted, the reddleman moving onwards with his van, and the two women remaining standing in the road. as soon as the vehicle and its driver had withdrawn so far as to be beyond all possible reach of her voice, mrs. yeobright turned to her niece.
â€œnow, thomasin,â€ she said sternly, â€œwhatâ€™s the meaning of this disgraceful performance?â€

thomasin looked as if quite overcome by her auntâ€™s change of manner. â€œit means just what it seems to mean: i amâ€”not married,â€ she replied faintly. â€œexcuse meâ€”for humiliating you, aunt, by this mishapâ€”i am sorry for it. but i cannot help it.â€
â€œme? think of yourself first.â€
â€œit was nobodyâ€™s fault. when we got there

the parson wouldnâ€™t marry us because of some trifling irregularity in the license.â€
â€œwhat irregularity?â€
â€œi donâ€™t know. mr. wildeve can explain. i did not think when i went away this morning that i should come back like this.â€ it being dark, thomasin allowed her emotion to escape her by the silent way of tears, which could roll down her cheek unseen.
â€œi could almost say that it serves you rightâ€”if i did not feel that you donâ€™t deserve it,â€ continued mrs. yeobright, who, possessing two distinct moods in close contiguity, a gentle mood and an angry, flew from one to the other without the least warning. â€œremember, thomasin, this business was none of my seeking; from the very first, when you began to feel foolish about that man, i warned you he would not make you happy. i felt it so strongly that i did what i would never have believed myself capable of doingâ€”stood up in the church, and made myself the public talk for weeks. but having once consented, i d

was not that. the license was wrong, and he couldnâ€™t get another the same day. he will tell you in a moment how it was, if he comes.â€
â€œwhy didnâ€™t he bring you back?â€
â€œthat was me!â€ again sobbed thomasin. â€œwhen i found we could not be married i didnâ€™t like to come back with him, and i was very ill. then i saw diggory venn, and was glad to get him to take me home. i cannot explain it any better, and you must be angry with me if you will.â€
â€œi shall see about that,â€ said mrs. yeobright; and they turned towards the inn, known in the neighbourhood as the quiet woman, the sign of which represented the figure of a matron carrying her head under her arm, beneath which gruesome design was written the couplet so well known to frequenters of the inn:â€”
since the womanâ€™s quiet let no man breed a riot.(1)

the window, whence the candlelight had shone up the vale to the eyes of the bonfire group, was uncurtained, but the sill lay too high for a pedestrian on the outside to look over it into the room. a vast shadow, in which could be dimly traced portions of a masculine contour, blotted half the ceiling.
â€œhe seems to be at home,â€ said mrs. yeobright.
â€œmust i come in, too, aunt?â€ asked thomasin faintly. â€œi suppose not; it would be wrong.â€
â€œyou must come, certainlyâ€”to confront him, so that he may make no false representations to me. we shall not be five minutes in the house, and then weâ€™ll walk home.â€
entering the open passage, she tapped at the door of the private parlour, unfastened it, and looked in.
the back and shoulders of a man came between mrs. yeobrightâ€™s eyes and the fire. wildeve, whose form it was, immediately t

he discerned the young girlâ€™s form in the passage, and said, â€œthomasin, then, has reached home. how could you leave me in that way, darling?â€ and turning to mrs. yeobrightâ€”â€œit was useless to argue with her. she would go, and go alone.â€
â€œbut whatâ€™s the meaning of it all?â€ demanded mrs. yeobright haughtily.
â€œtake a seat,â€ said wildeve, placing chairs for the two women. â€œwell, it was a very stupid mistake, but such mistakes will happen. the license was useless at anglebury. it was made out for budmouth, but as i didnâ€™t read it i wasnâ€™t aware of that.â€
â€œbut you had been staying at anglebury?â€
â€œno. i had been at budmouthâ€”till two days a

â€œi think you are very much to blame,â€ said mrs. yeobright.
â€œit was quite my fault we chose anglebury,â€ thomasin pleaded. â€œi proposed it because i was not known there.â€
â€œi know so well that i am to blame that you need not remind me of it,â€ replied wildeve shortly.
â€œsuch things donâ€™t happen for nothing,â€ said the aunt. â€œit is a great slight to me and my family; and when it gets known there will be a very unpleasant time for us. how can she look her friends in the face tomorrow? it is a very great injury, and one i cannot easily forgi

thomasinâ€™s large eyes had flown from the face of one to the face of the other during this discussion, and she now said anxiously, â€œwill you allow me, aunt, to talk it over alone with damon for five minutes? will you, damon?â€
â€œcertainly, dear,â€ said wildeve, â€œif your aunt will excuse us.â€ he led her into an adjoining room, leaving mrs. yeobright by the fire.
as soon as they were alone, and the door closed, thomasin said, turning up her pale, tearful face to him, â€œit is killing me, this, damon! i did not mean to part from you in anger at anglebury this morning; but i was frightened and hardly knew what i said. iâ€™ve not let aunt know how much i suffered today; and it is so hard to command my face and voice, and to smile as if it were a slight thing to me; but i try to do so, that she may not be still more indignant with you. i know y

mrs. yeobright burst in from the outer room. â€œthomasin, thomasin!â€ she said, looking indignantly at wildeve; â€œhereâ€™s a pretty exposure! let us escape at once. come!â€
it was, however, too late to get away by the passage. a rugged knocking had begun upon the door of the front room. wildeve, who had gone to the window, came back.

at the grandferâ€™s heels now came the rest of the group, which included fairway, christian, sam the turf-cutter, humphrey, and a dozen others. all smiled upon wildeve, and upon his tables and chairs likewise, from a general sense of friendliness towards the articles as well as towards their owner.
â€œwe be not here afore mrs. yeobright after all,â€ said fairway, recognizing the matronâ€™s bonnet through the glass partition which divided the public apartment they had entered from the room where the women sat. â€œwe struck down across, dâ€™ye see, mr. wildeve, and she went round by the path.â€
â€œand i see the young brideâ€™s little head!â€ said grandfer, peeping in the same direction, and discerning thomasin, who was waiting beside her aunt in a miserable and awkward way. â€œnot quite settled in yetâ€”well, well, thereâ€™s

he received no answer, all for the moment sitting rapt in admiration of the performance described. as with farinelliâ€™s singing before the princesses, sheridanâ€™s renowned begum speech, and other such examples, the fortunate condition of its being for ever lost to the world invested the deceased mr. yeobrightâ€™s tour de force on that memorable afternoon with a cumulative glory which comparative criticism, had that been possible, might considerably have shorn down.
â€œhe was the last youâ€™d have expected to drop off in the prime of life,â€ said humphrey.
â€œah, well; he was looking for the earth some months afore he went. at that time women used to run for smocks and gown-pieces at greenhill fair, and my wife that is now, being a long-legged slittering maid, hardly husband-high, went with the rest

dear diggory venn,â€”the question you put when you overtook me coming home from pond-close gave me such a surprise that i am afraid i did not make you exactly understand what i meant. of course, if my aunt had not met me i could have explained all then at once, but as it was there was no chance. i have been quite uneasy since, as you know i do not wish to pain you, yet i fear i shall be doing so now in contradicting what i seemed to say then. i cannot, diggory, marry y

thomasin yeobright.
to mr. venn, dairy-farmer.
since the arrival of that letter, on a certain autumn morning long ago, the reddleman and thomasin had not met till today. during the interval he had shifted his position even further from hers than it had originally been, by adopting the reddle trade; though he was really in very good circumstances still. indeed, seeing that his expenditure was only one-fourth of his income, he might have been called a prosperous man.

e captainâ€™s cottage was always more or less an undertaking for the inferior inhabitants. though occasionally chatty, his moods were erratic, and nobody could be certain how he would behave at any particular moment. eustacia was reserved, and lived very much to herself. except the daughter of one of the cotters, who was their servant, and a lad who worked in the garden and stable, scarcely anyone but themselves ever entered the house. they were the only genteel people of the district except the yeobrights, and though far from rich, they did not feel that necessity for preserving a friendly face towards every man, bird, and beast which influenced their poorer neighbours.
when the reddleman entered the garden the old man was looking through his glass at the stain of blue sea in the distant landscape, the little anchors on his buttons twinkling in the sun. he recognized venn as his companion on the highway, but made no remark on that circumstance, merely saying, â€œah, reddlemanâ€”you here? have a

â€œah! what man?â€
he jerked his elbow to the southeastâ€”the direction of the quiet woman.
eustacia turned quickly to him. â€œdo you mean mr. wildeve?â€
â€œyes, there is trouble in a household on account of him, and i have come to let you know of it, because i believe you might have power to drive it away.â€
â€œi? what is the trouble?â€
â€œit is quite a secret. it is that he may refuse to marry thomasin yeobright after all.â€
eustacia, though set inwardly pulsing by his words, was equal to her part in such a drama as this. she replied coldly, â€œi do not wish to listen to this, and you must not expect me to interfere.â€
â€œbut, miss, you will hear one word?â€
â€œi cannot. i am not interested in the marriage, and even if i were i could not compel mr. wildeve to do my bidding.â€

â€œah, my life!â€ said eustacia, with a laugh which unclosed her lips so that the sun shone into her mouth as into a tulip, and lent it a similar scarlet fire. â€œyou think too much of my influence over menfolk indeed, reddleman. if i had such a power as you imagine i would go straight and use it for the good of anybody who has been kind to meâ€”which thomasin yeobright has not particularly, to my knowledge.â€
â€œcan it be that you really donâ€™t know of itâ€”how much she had always thought of you?â€
â€œi have never heard a word of it. although we live only two miles apart i have never been inside her auntâ€™s house in my life.â€
the superciliousness that lurked in her manner told venn that thus far he had utterly failed. he inwardly sighed and felt it necessary to unmask his second argument.
â€œwell, leaving that out of the question, â€˜tis in your power,

11â€”the dishonesty of an honest woman

the reddleman had left eustaciaâ€™s presence with desponding views on thomasinâ€™s future happiness; but he was awakened to the fact that one other channel remained untried by seeing, as he followed the way to his van, the form of mrs. yeobright slowly walking towards the quiet woman. he went across to her; and could almost perceive in her anxious face that this journey of hers to wildeve was undertaken with the same object as his own to eustacia.
she did not conceal the fact. â€œthen,â€ said the reddleman, â€œyou may as well leave it alone, mrs. yeobright.â€
â€œi half think so myself,â€ she said. â€œbut nothing else remains to be done besides pressing the question upon him.â€
â€œi should like to say a word first,â€ said venn firm

mrs. yeobright was not demonstrative, but her eyes involuntarily glanced towards his singular though shapely figure.
â€œlooks are not everything,â€ said the reddleman, noticing the glance. â€œthereâ€™s many a calling that donâ€™t bring in so much as mine, if it comes to money; and perhaps i am not so much worse off than wildeve. there is nobody so poor as these professional fellows who have failed; and if you shouldnâ€™t like my rednessâ€”well, i am not red by birth, you know; i only took to this business fo

t it. but as she was unwilling on her own account to be your wife, that settles the point without my wishes being concerned.â€
â€œyes. but there is a difference between then and now, maâ€™am. she is distressed now, and i have thought that if you were to talk to her about me, and think favourably of me yourself, there might be a chance of winning her round, and getting her quite independent of this wildeveâ€™s backward and forward play, and his not knowing whether heâ€™ll have her or no.â€
mrs. yeobright shook her head. â€œthomasin thinks, and i think with her, that she ought to be wildeveâ€™s wife, if she means to appear before the world without a slur upon her name. if they marry soon, everybody will believe that an accident did really prevent the wedding. if not, it may cast a shade upon her characterâ€”at any rate make her ridiculous. in short, if it is anyhow possible they must marry now.â€

mrs. yeobright appeared disinclined to enter further into the question. â€œi fear i must go on,â€ she said. â€œi do not see that anything else can be done.â€
and she went on. but though this conversation did not divert thomasinâ€™s aunt from her purposed interview with wildeve, it made a considerable difference in her mode of conducting that interview. she thanked god for the weapon which the reddleman had put into her hands.

â€œi have thought it my duty to call today. a new proposal has been made to me, which has rather astonished me. it will affect thomasin greatly; and i have decided that it should at least be mentioned to you.â€
â€œyes? what is it?â€ he said civilly.
â€œit is, of course, in reference to her future. you may not be aware that another man has shown himself anxious to marry thomasin. now, though i have not encouraged him yet, i cannot conscientiously refuse him a chance any longer. i donâ

€™t wish to be short with you; but i must be fair to him and to her.â€
â€œwho is the man?â€ said wildeve with surprise.
â€œone who has been in love with her longer than she has with you. he proposed to her two years ago. at that time she refused him.â€
â€œwell?â€
â€œhe has seen her lately, and has asked me for permission to pay his addresses to her. she may not refuse him twice.â€
â€œwhat is his name?â€
mrs. yeobright declined to say. â€œhe is a man thomasin likes,â€ she added, â€œand one whose constancy she respects at least. it seems to me that what she refused then she would be glad to get now. she is much annoyed at her awkward position.â€
â€œshe never once told me of this old lover.â€
â€œthe gentlest women are not such fools as to show every card.â€
â€œwell, if she wants him i suppose she must have him.â€
â€œit is easy enough to say that; but you donâ€™t see the difficulty. he wants her much more t

â€œi can hardly say that just now, mrs. yeobright. it is so sudden.â€
â€œand so my whole plan is interfered with! it is very inconvenient that you refuse to help my family even to the small extent of saying distinctly you will have nothing to do with us.â€
wildeve reflected uncomfortably. â€œi confess i was not prepared for this,â€ he said. â€œof course iâ€™ll give her up if you wish, if it is necessary. but i thought i might be her husband.â€
â€œwe have heard that before.â€

â€œyes,â€ she replied, â€œprovided you promise not to communicate with thomasin without my knowledge.â€
â€œi promise that,â€ he said. and the interview then terminated, mrs. yeobright returning homeward as she had come.
by far the greatest effect of her simple strategy on that day was, as often happens, in a quarter quite outside her view when arranging it. in the first place, her visit sent wildeve the same evening after dark to eustaciaâ€™s house at mistover.
at this hour the lonely dwelling was closely blinded and shuttered from the chill and darkness without. wildeveâ€™s clandestine plan with her was to take a little gravel in his hand and hold it to the crevice at the t

â€œah, i knew she had something to do with it! come, i donâ€™t like reserve.â€
â€œnoâ€”she has nothing. she only says she wishes me to give up thomasin because another man is anxious to marry her. the woman, now she no longer needs me, actually shows off!â€ wildeveâ€™s vexation has escaped him in spite of himself.

hen her rich, romantic lips parted under that homely impulseâ€”a yawn. she was immediately angry at having betrayed even to herself the possible evanescence of her passion for him. she could not admit at once that she might have overestimated wildeve, for to perceive his mediocrity now was to admit her own great folly heretofore. and the discovery that she was the owner of a disposition so purely that of the dog in the manger had something in it which at first made her ashamed.
the fruit of mrs. yeobrightâ€™s diplomacy was indeed remarkable, though not as yet of the kind she had anticipated. it had appreciably influenced wildeve, but it was influencing eustacia far more. her lover was no longer to her an exciting man whom many women strove for, and herself could only retain by striving with them. he was a superfluity.
she went indoors in that peculiar state of misery which is not exactly grief, and which especially attends the dawnings of reason in the latter days of an ill-judged, transient lov

â€œif he could have been dear to you in another way,â€ said mrs. yeobright from the ladder, â€œthis might have been a happy meeting.â€

t down the hill with her aunt, each woman bearing half the gathered boughs. it was now nearly four oâ€™clock, and the sunlight was leaving the vales. when the west grew red the two relatives came again from the house and plunged into the heath in a different direction from the first, towards a point in the distant highway along which the expected man was to return.




3â€”how a little sound produced a great dream

eustacia stood just within the heath, straining her eyes in the direction of mrs. yeobrightâ€™s house and premises. no light, sound, or movement was perceptible there. the evening was chilly; the spot was dark and lonely. she inferred that the guest had not yet come; and after lingering ten or fifteen minutes she turned again towards home.
she had not far retraced her steps when sounds in front of her betokened the approach of persons in conversation along the same path. soon their heads became visible against the sky. they were walking slowly; and though it was too dark for much disc

overy of character from aspect, the gait of them showed that they were not workers on the heath. eustacia stepped a little out of the foot-track to let them pass. they were two women and a man; and the voices of the women were those of mrs. yeobright and thomasin.
they went by her, and at the moment of passing appeared to discern her dusky form. there came to her ears in a masculine voice, â€œgood night!â€
she murmured a reply, glided by them, and turned round. she could not, for a moment, believe that chance, unrequested, had brought into her presence the soul of the house she had gone to inspect, the man without whom her inspection would not have been thought of.
she strained her eyes to see them, but was unable. such was her intentness,

ted her; and all besides withheld. no event could have been more exciting. during the greater part of the afternoon she had been entrancing herself by imagining the fascination which must attend a man come direct from beautiful parisâ€”laden with its atmosphere, familiar with its charms. and this man had greeted her.
with the departure of the figures the profuse articulations of the women wasted away from her memory; but the accents of the other stayed on. was there anything in the voice of mrs. yeobrightâ€™s sonâ€”for clym it wasâ€”startling as a sound? no; it was simply comprehensive. all emotional things were possible to the speaker of that â€œgood night.â€ eustaciaâ€™s imagination supplied the restâ€”except the solution to one riddle. what could the tastes of that man be who saw friendliness and geniality in these shaggy hills?
on such occasions as this a thousand ideas pass through a highly charged womanâ€™s head; and they indicate themselves on her face; but the changes, though actual, ar

 them. she glowed; remembering the mendacity of the imagination, she flagged; then she freshened; then she fired; then she cooled again. it was a cycle of aspects, produced by a cycle of visions.
eustacia entered her own house; she was excited. her grandfather was enjoying himself over the fire, raking about the ashes and exposing the red-hot surface of the turves, so that their lurid glare irradiated the chimney-corner with the hues of a furnace.
â€œwhy is it that we are never friendly with the yeobrights?â€ she said, coming forward and stretching her soft hands over the warmth. â€œi wish we were. they seem to be very nice people.â€
â€œbe hanged if i know why,â€ said the captain. â€œi liked the old man well enough, though he was as rough as a hedge. but you would never have cared to go there, even if you might have, i am well sure.â€
â€œwhy shouldnâ€™t i?â€
â€œyour town tastes would find them far too countrified. they sit in the kitchen, drink mead and elder-wine, and sand the floor to kee

p it clean. a sensible way of life; but how would you like it?â€
â€œi thought mrs. yeobright was a ladylike woman? a curateâ€™s daughter, was she not?â€
â€œyes; but she was obliged to live as her husband did; and i suppose she has taken kindly to it by this time. ah, i recollect that i once accidentally offended her, and i have never seen her since.â€
that night was an eventful one to eustaciaâ€™s brain, and one which she hardly ever forgot. she dreamt a dream; and few human beings, from nebuchadnezzar to the swaffham tinker, ever dreamt a more remarkable one. such an elaborately dev

y looking up she saw him removing his casque to kiss her. at that moment there was a cracking noise, and his figure fell into fragments like a pack of cards.
she cried aloud. â€œo that i had seen his face!â€
eustacia awoke. the cracking had been that of the window shutter downstairs, which the maid-servant was opening to let in the day, now slowly increasing to natureâ€™s meagre allowance at this sickly time of the year. â€œo that i had seen his face!â€ she said again. â€œâ€˜twas meant for mr. yeobright!â€
when she became cooler she perceived that many of the phases of the dream had naturally arisen out of the images and fancies of the day before. but this detracted little from its interest, which lay in the excellent fuel it provided for newly kindled fervour. she was at the modulating point between indifference and love, at the stage called â€œhaving a fancy for.â€ it occurs once in the history of the most gigantic passions, and it is a period when they are in the hands of the weakest will

the perfervid woman was by this time half in love with a vision. the fantastic nature of her passion, which lowered her as an intellect, raised her as a soul. if she had had a little more self-control she would have attenuated the emotion to nothing by sheer reasoning, and so have killed it off. if she had had a little less pride she might have gone and circumambulated the yeobrightsâ€™ premises at blooms-end at any maidenly sacrifice until she had seen him. but eustacia did neither of these things. she acted as the most exemplary might have acted, being so influenced; she took an airing twice or thrice a day upon the egdon hills, and kept her eyes employed.
the first occasion passed, and he did not come that way.
she promenaded a second time, and was again the sole wanderer there.

but providence is nothing if not coquettish; and no sooner had eustacia formed this resolve than the opportunity came which, while sought, had been entirely withholden.




4â€”eustacia is led on to an adventure

in the evening of this last day of expectation, which was the twenty-third of december, eustacia was at home alone. she had passed the recent hour in lamenting over a rumour newly come to her earsâ€”that yeobrightâ€™s visit to his mother was to be of short duration, and would end some time the next week. â€œnaturally,â€ she said to herself. a man in the full swing of his activities in a gay city could not afford to linger long on egdon heath. that she would behold face to face the owner of the awakening voice within the limits of such a holiday was most unlikely, unless she were to haunt the environs of his motherâ€™s house like a robin, to do which was difficult and unseemly.

le who came to these few isolated houses to keep christmas with their friends remained in their friendsâ€™ chimney-corners drinking mead and other comforting liquors till they left again for good and all. rain, snow, ice, mud everywhere around, they did not care to trudge two or three miles to sit wet-footed and splashed to the nape of their necks among those who, though in some measure neighbours, lived close to the church, and entered it clean and dry. eustacia knew it was ten to one that clym yeobright would go to no church at all during his few days of leave, and that it would be a waste of labour for her to go driving the pony and gig over a bad road in hope to see him there.
it was dusk, and she was sitting by the fire in the dining-room or hall, which they occupied at this time of the year in preference to the parlour, because of its large hearth, constructed for turf-fires, a fuel the captain was partial to in the winter season. the only visible articles in the room were those on the win

â€œwell, ye be as well up to it as ever ye will be,â€ he said. â€œnot that such mumming would have passed in our time. harry as the saracen should strut a bit more, and john neednâ€™t holler his inside out. beyond that perhaps youâ€™ll do. have you got all your clothes ready?â€
â€œwe shall by monday.â€
â€œyour first outing will be monday night, i suppose?â€
â€œyes. at mrs. yeobrightâ€™s.â€
â€œoh, mrs. yeobrightâ€™s. what makes her want to see ye? i should think a middle-aged woman was tired of mumming.â€
â€œsheâ€™s got up a bit of a party, because â€˜tis the first christmas that her son clym has been home for a long time.â€
â€œto be sure, to be sureâ€”her party! i am going myself. i almost forgot it, upon my life.â€
eustaciaâ€™s face flagged. there was to be a party at the yeobrightsâ€™; she, naturally, had nothing to do with it. she was a stranger to all such local ga

eustacia then proceeded in her delivery, striking the sword against the staff or lance at the minatory phrases, in the orthodox mumming manner, and strutting up and down. charley seasoned his admiration with criticism of the gentlest kind, for the touch of eustaciaâ€™s hand yet remained with him.
â€œand now for your excuse to the others,â€ she said. â€œwhere do you meet before you go to mrs. yeobrightâ€™s?â€
â€œwe thought of meeting here, miss, if you have nothing to say against it. at eight oâ€™clock, so as to get there by nine.â€
â€œyes. well, you of course must not appear. i will march in about five minutes late, ready-dressed, and tell them that you canâ€™t come. i have decided that the best plan will be for you to be sent somewhere by me, to make a real thing of the excuse. our two heath-croppers are in the habit of straying into the meads, and tomorrow evening you can go and see if t

the play was hastily rehearsed, whereupon the other mummers were delighted with the new knight. they extinguished the candles at half-past eight, and set out upon the heath in the direction of mrs. yeobrightâ€™s house at bloomâ€™s-end.
there was a slight hoarfrost that night, and the moon, though not more than half full, threw a spirited and enticing brightness upon the fantastic figures of the mumming band, whose plumes and ribbons rustled in their walk like autumn leaves. their path was not over rainbarrow now, but down a valley which left that ancient elevation a little to the east. the bottom of the vale was green to a width of ten yards or thereabouts, and the shining facets of frost upon the

it became at once evident that the dance was proceeding immediately within the surface of the door, no apartment intervening. the brushing of skirts and elbows, sometimes the bumping of shoulders, could be heard against the very panels. eustacia, though living within two miles of the place, had never seen the interior of this quaint old habitation. between captain vye and the yeobrights there had never existed much acquaintance, the former having come as a stranger and purchased the long-empty house at mistover knap not long before the death of mrs. yeobrightâ€™s husband; and with that event and the departure of her son such friendship as had grown up became quite broken off.
â€œis there no passage inside the door, then?â€ asked eustacia as they stood within the porch.
â€œno,â€ said the lad who played the saracen. â€œthe door opens right upon the front sitting-room, where t

the first five minutes of listening was interesting enough to the mummers. the five minutes extended to ten minutes, and these to a quarter of an hour; but no signs of ceasing were audible in the lively â€œdream.â€ the bumping against the door, the laughter, the stamping, were all as vigorous as ever, and the pleasure in being outside lessened considerably.
â€œwhy does mrs. yeobright give parties of this sort?â€ eustacia asked, a little surprised to hear merriment so pronounced.
â€œit is not one of her bettermost parlour-parties. sheâ€™s asked the plain neighbours and workpeople without drawing any lines, just to give â€˜em a good supper and such like. her son and she wait upon the folks.â€

re grouped the guests, many of them being warm-faced and panting, among whom eustacia cursorily recognized some well-to-do persons from beyond the heath. thomasin, as she had expected, was not visible, and eustacia recollected that a light had shone from an upper window when they were outsideâ€”the window, probably, of thomasinâ€™s room. a nose, chin, hands, knees, and toes projected from the seat within the chimney opening, which members she found to unite in the person of grandfer cantle, mrs. yeobrightâ€™s occasional assistant in the garden, and therefore one of the invited. the smoke went up from an etna of peat in front of him, played round the notches of the chimney-crook, struck against the salt-box, and got lost among the flitches.
another part of the room soon riveted her gaze. at the other side of the chimney stood the settle, which is the necessary supplement to a fire so open that nothing less than a strong breeze will carry up the smoke. it is, to the hearths of old-fashioned cavern

it was, however, not with those who sat in the settle that eustacia was concerned. a face showed itself with marked distinctness against the dark-tanned wood of the upper part. the owner, who was leaning against the settleâ€™s outer end, was clement yeobright, or clym, as he was called here; she knew it could be nobody else. the spectacle constituted an area of two feet in rembrandtâ€™s intensest manner. a strange power in the loungerâ€™s appearance lay in the fact that, though his whole figure was visible, the observerâ€™s eye was only aware of his face.

the face was well shaped, even excellently. but the mind within was beginning to use it as a mere waste tablet whereon to trace its idiosyncrasies as they developed themselves. the beauty here visible would in no long time be ruthlessly over-run by its parasite, thought, which might just as well have fed upon a plainer exterior where there was nothing it could harm. had heaven preserved yeobright from a wearing habit of meditation, people would have said, â€œa handsome man.â€ had his brain unfolded under sharper contours they would have said, â€œa thoughtful man.â€ but an inner strenuousness was preying upon an outer symmetry, and they rated his look as singular.
hence people who began by beholding him ended by perusing him. his countenance was overlaid with legible meanings. without being thought-worn he yet had certain marks derived from a perception of his surroundings, such as are

when standing before certain men the philosopher regrets that thinkers are but perishable tissue, the artist that perishable tissue has to think. thus to deplore, each from his point of view, the mutually destructive interdependence of spirit and flesh would have been instinctive with these in critically observing yeobright.
as for his look, it was a natural cheerfulness striving against depression from without, and not quite succeeding. the look suggested isolation, but it revealed something more. as is usual with bright natures, the deity that lies ignominiously chained within an ephemeral human carcase shone out of him like a ray.

the remainder of the play endedâ€”the saracenâ€™s head was cut off, and saint george stood as victor. nobody commented, any more than they would have commented on the fact of mushrooms coming in autumn or snowdrops in spring. they took the piece as phlegmatically as did the actors themselves. it was a phase of cheerfulness which was, as a matter of course, to be passed through every christmas; and there was no more to be said.

â€œcome in, come in,â€ said mrs. yeobright; and clym went forward to welcome them. â€œhow is it you are so late? grandfer cantle has been here ever so long, and we thought youâ€™d have come with him, as you live so near one another.â€
â€œwell, i should have come earlier,â€ mr. fairway said and paused to look along the beam of the ceiling for a nail to hang his hat on; but, finding his accustomed one to be occupied by the mistletoe, and all the nails in the walls to be burdened with bunches of holly, he at last relieved himself of the

â€œand i thought so too, mrs. yeobright,â€ said christian earnestly, â€œbut father there was so eager that he had no manners at all, and left home almost afore â€˜twas dark. i told him â€˜twas barely decent in aâ€™ old man to come so oversoon; but words be wind.â€
â€œklk! i wasnâ€™t going to bide waiting about, till half the game was over! iâ€™m as light as a kite when anythingâ€™s going on!â€ crowed grandfer cantle from the chimneyseat.
fairway had meanwhile concluded a critical gaze at yeobright. â€œnow, you may not believe it,â

â€œmaster yeobright, look me over too. i have altered for the better, havenâ€™t i, hey?â€ said grandfer cantle, rising and placing himself something above half a foot from clymâ€™s eye, to induce the most searching criticism.
â€œto be sure we will,â€ said fairway, taking the candle and moving it over the surface of the grandferâ€™s countenance, the subject of his scrutiny irradiating himself with light and pleasant smiles, and giving himself jerks of juvenility.
â€œyou havenâ€™t changed much,â€ said yeobright.

â€œi will.â€ said christian. â€œbut now i think oâ€™t my shadder last night seemed just the shape of a coffin. what is it a sign of when your shadeâ€™s like a coffin, neighbours? it canâ€™t be nothing to be afeared of, i suppose?â€
â€œafeared, no!â€ said the grandfer. â€œfaith, i was never afeard of nothing except boney, or i shouldnâ€™t haâ€™ been the soldier i was. yes, â€˜tis a thousand pities you didnâ€™t see me in four!â€
by this time the mummers were preparing to leave; but mrs. yeobright stopped them by asking them to sit down and have a little supper. to this invitation father christmas, in the name of them all, readily agreed.
eustacia was happy in the opportunity of staying a little longer. the cold and frosty night without was doubly frigid to her. but the lingering was not without its difficulties. mrs. yeobright, for want of room in the larger apartment, placed a bench for the mummers halfway through the pantry door, which opened from the sitting-room. here they seated th

â€œbut you will surely have some?â€ said clym to the turkish knight, as he stood before that warrior, tray in hand. she had refused, a

â€œnone, thank you,â€ replied eustacia.
â€œheâ€™s quite a youngster,â€ said the saracen apologetically, â€œand you must excuse him. heâ€™s not one of the old set, but have jined us because tâ€™other couldnâ€™t come.â€
â€œbut he will take something?â€ persisted yeobright. â€œtry a glass of mead or elder-wine.â€
â€œyes, you had better try that,â€ said the saracen. â€œit will keep the cold out going home-along.â€
though eustacia could not eat without uncovering her face she could drink easily enough beneath her disguise. the elder-wine was accordingly accepted, and the glass vanished inside the ribbons.
at moments during this performance eustacia was half in doubt about the security of her position; yet it had a fearful joy. a series of attentions paid to her,

did anything at this moment suggest to yeobright the sex of the creature whom that fantastic guise inclosed, how extended was her scope both in feeling and in making others feel, and how far her compass transcended that of her companions in the band? when the disguised queen of love appeared before aeneas a preternatural perfume accompanied her presence and betrayed her quality. if such a mysterious emanation ever was projected by the emotions of an earthly woman upon their object, it must have signified eustaciaâ€™s presence to yeobright now

the person was thomasin, with a candle, looking anxious, pale, and interesting. yeobright appeared glad to see her, and pressed her hand. â€œthatâ€™s right, tamsie,â€ he said heartily, as though recalled to himself by the sight of her, â€œyou have decided to come down. i am glad of it.â€
â€œhushâ€”no, no,â€ she said quickly. â€œi only came to speak to you.â€
â€œbut why not join us?â€

mmediate desire. the other mummers appeared to be in no hurry to leave; and murmuring to the lad who sat next to her that she preferred waiting for them outside the house, she moved to the door as imperceptibly as possible, opened it, and slipped out.
the calm, lone scene reassured her. she went forward to the palings and leant over them, looking at the moon. she had stood thus but a little time when the door again opened. expecting to see the remainder of the band eustacia turned; but noâ€”clym yeobright came out as softly as she had done, and closed the door behind him.
he advanced and stood beside her. â€œi have an odd opinion,â€ he said, â€œand should like to ask you a question. are you a womanâ€”or am i wrong?â€
â€œi am a woman.â€
his eyes lingered on her with great interest. â€œdo girls often play as mummers now? they never used to.â€
â€œthey donâ€™t now.â€

eustacia, warmed with an inner fire, could not wait for her companions after this. she flung back the ribbons from her face, opened the gate, and at once struck into the heath. she did not hasten along. her grandfather was in bed at this hour, for she so frequently walked upon the hills on moonlight nights that he took no notice of her comings and goings, and, enjoying himself in his own way, left her to do likewise. a more important subject than that of getting indoors now engrossed her. yeobright, if he had the least curiosity, would infallibly discover her name. what then? she first felt a sort of exultation at the way in which the adventure had terminated, even though at moments between her exultations she was abashed and blushful. then this consideration recurred to chill her: what was the use of her exploit? she was at present a total stranger to the yeobright family. the unreasonable nimbus of romance with which she had encircled that man might be her misery. how could she allow he

eustacia looked at the lonely man. wildeve had told her at their last meeting that venn had been thrust forward by mrs. yeobright as one ready and anxious to take his place as thomasinâ€™s betrothed. his figure was perfect, his face young and well outlined, his eye bright, his intelligence keen, and his position one which he could readily better if he chose. but in spite of possibilities it was not likely that thomasin would accept this ishmaelitish creature while she had a cousin like yeobright at her elbow, and wildeve at the same time not absolutely indifferent. eustacia was not long in guessing that poor mrs. yeobrigh

â€œgood morning, miss,â€ said the reddleman, taking off his cap of hareskin, and apparently bearing her no ill-will from recollection of their last meeting.
â€œgood morning, reddleman,â€ she said, hardly troubling to lift her heavily shaded eyes to his. â€œi did not know you were so near. is your van here too?â€
venn moved his elbow towards a hollow in which a dense brake of purple-stemmed brambles had grown to such vast dimensions as

the roof and chimney of vennâ€™s caravan showed behind the tracery and tangles of the brake.
â€œyou remain near this part?â€ she asked with more interest.
â€œyes, i have business here.â€
â€œnot altogether the selling of reddle?â€
â€œit has nothing to do with that.â€
â€œit has to do with miss yeobright?â€
her face seemed to ask for an armed peace, and he therefore said frankly, â€œyes, miss; it is on account of her.â€
â€œon account of your approaching marriage with her?â€
venn flushed through his stain. â€œdonâ€™t make sport of me, miss vye,â€ he said.
â€œit isnâ€™t true?â€
â€œcertainly not.â€
she was thus convinced that the reddleman was a mere pis aller in mrs. yeobrightâ€™s mind; one, moreover, who had not even been informed of his promotion to that lowly standing. â€œit was a mere n

â€œmy interests?â€
â€œcertainly. â€˜twas your interest not to do anything which would send me courting thomasin again, now she has accepted youâ€”or something like it. mrs. yeobright says you are to marry her. â€˜tisnâ€™t true, then?â€
â€œgood lord! i heard of this before, but didnâ€™t believe it. when did she say so?â€
wildeve began humming as the reddleman had done.
â€œi donâ€™t believe it now,â€ cried venn.
â€œru-um-tum-tum,â€ sang wildeve.
â€œo lordâ€”how we can imitate!â€ said venn contemptuously. â€œiâ€™ll have this out. iâ€™ll go straight to her.â€

full of this resolve to marry in haste, and wring the heart of the proud girl, wildeve went his way.
meanwhile diggory venn had returned to his van, where he stood looking thoughtfully into the stove. a new vista was opened up to him. but, however promising mrs. yeobrightâ€™s views of him might be as a candidate for her nieceâ€™s hand, one condition was indispensable to the favour of thomasin herself, and that was a renunciation of his present wild mode of life. in this he saw little difficulty.
he could not afford to wait till the next day before seeing thomasin and detailing his plan. he speedily plunged himself into toilet operations, pulled a suit of cloth clothes from a box, and in about twenty minutes stood before the van-lantern as a reddleman in nothing

€œman alive, youâ€™ve been quick at it,â€ said diggory sarcastically.
â€œand you slow, as you will find,â€ said wildeve. â€œand,â€ lowering his voice, â€œyou may as well go back again now. iâ€™ve claimed her, and got her. good night, reddleman!â€ thereupon wildeve walked away.
vennâ€™s heart sank within him, though it had not risen unduly high. he stood leaning over the palings in an indecisive mood for nearly a quarter of an hour. then he went up the garden path, knocked, and asked for mrs. yeobright.
instead of requesting him to enter she came to the porch. a discourse was carried on between them in low measured tones for the space of ten minutes or more. at the end of the time mrs. yeobright went in, and venn sadly retraced his steps into the heath. when he had again regained his van he lit the lantern, and with an apathetic face at once began to pull off his best clothes, till in the course of a few minutes he reappeared as the confirmed and irretrievable reddleman that he had seemed bef

8â€”firmness is discovered in a gentle heart

on that evening the interior of blooms-end, though cosy and comfortable, had been rather silent. clym yeobright was not at home. since the christmas party he had gone on a few daysâ€™ visit to a friend about ten miles off.
the shadowy form seen by venn to part from wildeve in the porch, and quickly withdraw into the house, was thomasinâ€™s. on entering she threw down a cloak which had been carelessly wrapped round her, and came forward to the light, where mrs. yeobright sat at her work-table, drawn up within the settle, so that part of it projected into the chimney-corner.

â€œi have only been just outside the door.â€
â€œwell?â€ inquired mrs. yeobright, struck by a change in the tone of thomasinâ€™s voice, and observing her. thomasinâ€™s cheek was flushed to a pitch far beyond that which it had reached before her troubles, and her eyes glittered.
â€œit was he who knocked,â€ she said.
â€œi thought as much.â€
â€œhe wishes the marriage to be at once.â€
â€œindeed! whatâ€”is he anxious?â€ mrs. yeobright directed a searching look upon her niece. â€œwhy did not mr. wildeve come in?â€
â€œhe did not wish to. you are not friends with him, he says.

 he would like the wedding to be the day after tomorrow, quite privately; at the church of his parishâ€”not at ours.â€
â€œoh! and what did you say?â€
â€œi agreed to it,â€ thomasin answered firmly. â€œi am a practical woman now. i donâ€™t believe in hearts at all. i would marry him under any circumstances sinceâ€”since clymâ€™s letter.â€
a letter was lying on mrs. yeobrightâ€™s work-basket, and at thomasinâ€™s words her aunt reopened it, and silently read for the tenth time that day:â€”
what is the meaning of this silly story that people are circulating about thomasin and mr. wildeve? i should call such a scandal humiliating if there was the least chance of its being true. how could such a gross falsehood have arisen? it is said that one should go abroad to hear news of home, and i appear to have done it. of course i contradict the tale everywhere; but it is very

â€œyes,â€ mrs. yeobright said sadly, putting down the letter. â€œif you think you can marry him, do so. and since mr. wildeve wishes it to be unceremonious, let it be that too. i can do nothing. it is all in your own hands now. my power over your welfare came to an end when you left this house to go with him to anglebury.â€ she continued, half in bitterness, â€œi may almost ask, why do you consult me in the matter at all? if you had gone and married him without saying a word to me, i could hardly have been angryâ€”sim

â€œdonâ€™t say that and dishearten me.â€
â€œyou are rightâ€”i will not.â€
â€œi do not plead for him, aunt. human nature is weak, and i am not a blind woman to insist that he is perfect. i did think so, but i donâ€™t now. but i know my course, and you know that i know it. i hope for the best.â€
â€œand so do i, and we will both continue to,â€ said mrs. yeobright, rising and kissing her. â€œthen the wedding, if it comes off, will be on the morning of the very day clym comes home?â€
â€œyes. i decided that it ought to be over before he came. after that you can look him in the face, and so can i. our concealments will matter nothing.â€
mrs. yeobright moved her head in thoughtful assent, and presently said, â€œdo you wish me to give you away? i am willing to undertake that, you know, if you wish, as i was last time. after once forbidding the banns i think

â€œo no, aunt,â€ murmured thomasin.
they said no more on the subject then. diggory vennâ€™s knock came soon after; and mrs. yeobright, on returning from her interview with him in the porch, carelessly observed, â€œanother lover has come to ask for you.â€
â€œno?â€
â€œyes, that queer young man venn.â€
â€œasks to pay his addresses to me?â€
â€œyes; and i told him he was too late.â€
thomasin looked silently into the candle-flame. â€œpoor diggory!â€ she said, and then aroused herself to other things.

mrs. yeobright breathed in a way which might have been called a sigh. â€œi almost wish clym had been at home,â€ she said. â€œof course you chose the time because of his absence.â€
â€œpartly. i have felt that i acted unfairly to him in not telling him all; but, as it was done not to grieve him, i thought i would carry out the plan to its end, and tell the whole story when the sky was clear.â€

â€œit is necessary,â€ said thomasin.
â€œat any rate,â€ added her aunt with forced cheerfulness, â€œi shall call upon you this afternoon, and bring the cake with me. if clym has returned by that time he will perhaps come too. i wish to show mr. wildeve that i bear him no ill-will. let the past be forgotten. well, god bless you! there, i donâ€™t believe in old superstitions, but iâ€™ll do it.â€ she threw a slipper at

â€œiâ€”i amâ€”â€ thomasin began, giving way likewise. but, quelling her grief, she said â€œgood-bye!â€ again and went on.
then mrs. yeobright saw a little figure wending its way between the scratching furze-bushes, and diminishing far up the valleyâ€”a pale-blue spot in a vast field of neutral brown, solitary and undefended except by

wildeve had been so timed as to enable her to escape the awkwardness of meeting her cousin clym, who was returning the same morning. to own to the partial truth of what he had heard would be distressing as long as the humiliating position resulting from the event was unimproved. it was only after a second and successful journey to the altar that she could lift up her head and prove the failure of the first attempt a pure accident.
she had not been gone from blooms-end more than half an hour when yeobright came by the meads from the other direction and entered the house.
â€œi had an early breakfast,â€ he said to his mother after greeting her. â€œnow i could eat a little more.â€
they sat down to the repeated meal, and he went on in a low, anxious voice, apparently imagining that thomasin had not yet come downstairs, â€œwhatâ€™s this i have heard about thomasin and mr. wildeve?â€
â€œit is true in many points,â€ said mrs. yeobright quietly; â€œbut it is all right now, i hope.â€ she looked at th

she then told him the circumstances. all that he had known of the affair before he returned from paris was that there had existed an attachment between thomasin and wildeve, which his mother had at first discountenanced, but had since, owing to the arguments of thomasin, looked upon in a little more favourable light. when she, therefore, proceeded to explain all he was greatly surprised and troubled.
â€œand she determined that the wedding should be over before you came back,â€ said mrs. yeobright, â€œthat there might be no chance of her meeting you, and having a very painful time of it. thatâ€™s why she has gone to him; they have arranged to be married this morning.â€
â€œbut i canâ€™t understand it,â€ said yeobright, rising. â€œâ€˜tis so unlike her. i can see why you did not write to me after her unfortunate return home. but why didnâ€™t you let me know when the wedding was going to beâ€”the first time?â€
â€œwell, i felt vexed with her just then. she seemed to me to be obstinate; and

â€œit made no difference. i had arranged to give one, and it was not worth while to make more gloom than necessary. to begin by shutting ourselves up and telling you of tamsinâ€™s misfortunes would have been a poor sort of welcome.â€
clym remained thinking. â€œi almost wish you had not had that party,â€ he said; â€œand for other reasons. but i will tell you in a day or two. we must think of tamsin now.â€
they lapsed into silence. â€œiâ€™ll tell you what,â€ said yeobright again, in a tone which showed some slumbering feeling still. â€œi donâ€™t think it kind to tamsin to let her be married like this, and neither of us there to keep up her spirits or care a bit about her. she hasnâ€™t disgraced herself, or done anything to deserve that. it is bad enough that the wedding should be so hurried and unceremonious, without our keeping away from it in addition. upon my soul, â€˜tis almost a shame. iâ€™ll go.â€
â€œit is over by this time,â€ said his mother with a sigh;

â€œand ruined her character?â€
â€œnonsenseâ€”that wouldnâ€™t ruin thomasin.â€
he took up his hat and hastily left the house. mrs. yeobright looked rather unhappy, and sat still, deep in thought. but she was not long left alone. a few minutes later clym came back again, and in his company came diggory venn.
â€œi find there isnâ€™t time for me to get there,â€ said clym.
â€œis she married?â€ mrs. yeobright inquired, turning to the reddleman a face in which a strange strife of wishes, for and against, was apparent.

in clym yeobrightâ€™s face could be dimly seen the typical countenance of the future. should there be a classic period to art hereafter, its pheidias may produce such faces. the view of life as a thing to be put up with, replacing that zest for existence which was so intense in early civilizations, must ultimately enter so thoroughly into the constitution of the advanced races that its facial expression will become accepted as a new artistic departure. people already feel that a man who lives without disturbing

the lineaments which will get embodied in ideals based upon this new recognition will probably be akin to those of yeobright. the observerâ€™s eye was arrested, not by his face as a picture, but by his face as a page; not by what it was, but by what it recorded. his features were attractive in the light of symbols, as sounds intrinsically common become attractive in language, and as shapes intrinsically simple become interesting in writing.

hence, when his name was casually mentioned by neighbouring yeomen, the listener said, â€œah, clym yeobrightâ€”what is he doing now?â€ when the instinctive question about a person is, what is he doing? it is felt that he will be found to be, like most of us, doing nothing in particular. there is an indefinite sense that he must be invading some region of singularity, good or bad. the devout hope is that he is doing well. the secret faith is that he is making a mess of it. half a dozen comfortable market-men, who were habitual callers at the quiet woman as they passed by in their carts, were partial t

o the topic. in fact, though they were not egdon men, they could hardly avoid it while they sucked their long clay tubes and regarded the heath through the window. clym had been so inwoven with the heath in his boyhood that hardly anybody could look upon it without thinking of him. so the subject recurred: if he were making a fortune and a name, so much the better for him; if he were making a tragical figure in the world, so much the better for a narrative.
the fact was that yeobrightâ€™s fame had spread to an awkward extent before he left home. â€œit is bad when your fame outruns your means,â€ said the spanish jesuit gracian. at the age of six he had asked a scripture riddle: â€œwho was the first man known to wear breeches?â€ and applause had resounded from the very verge of the heath. at seven he painted the battle of waterloo with tiger-lily pollen and black-currant juice, in the absence of water-colours. by the time he reached twelve he had in this manner been heard of

 which started clive as a writing clerk, gay as a linen-draper, keats as a surgeon, and a thousand others in a thousand other odd ways, banished the wild and ascetic heath lad to a trade whose sole concern was with the especial symbols of self-indulgence and vainglory.
the details of this choice of a business for him it is not necessary to give. at the death of his father a neighbouring gentleman had kindly undertaken to give the boy a start, and this assumed the form of sending him to budmouth. yeobright did not wish to go there, but it was the only feasible opening. thence he went to london; and thence, shortly after, to paris, where he had remained till now.
something being expected of him, he had not been at home many days before a great curiosity as to why he stayed on so long began to arise in the heath. the natural term of a holiday had passed, yet he still remained. on the sunday morning following the week of thomasinâ€™s marriage a discussion on this subject was in progress at a hair-cu

the conversation on yeobright had been started by a distant view of the young man rambling leisurely across the heath before them.

in passing from the bucolic to the intellectual life the intermediate stages are usually two at least, frequently many more; and one of those stages is almost sure to be worldly advanced. we can hardly imagine bucolic placidity quickening to intellectual aims without imagining social aims as the transitional phase. yeobrightâ€™s local peculiarity was that in striving at high thinking he still cleaved to plain livingâ€”nay, wild and meagre living in many respects, and brotherliness with clowns.
he was a john the baptist who took ennoblement rather than repentance for his text. mentally he was in a provincial future, that is, he was in many points abreast with the central town thinkers of his date. much of this development he may have owed to his studious life in paris, where he had become acquainted with ethical sys

in consequence of this relatively advanced position, yeobright might have been called unfortunate. the rural world was not ripe for him. a man should be only partially before his timeâ€”to be completely to the vanward in aspirations is fatal to fame. had philipâ€™s warlike son been intellectually so far ahead as to have attempted civilization without bloodshed, he would have been twice the godlike hero that he seemed, but nobody would have heard of an alexander.
in the interests of renown the forwardness should lie chiefly in the capacity to handle things.

l propagandists have succeeded because the doctrine they bring into form is that which their listeners have for some time felt without being able to shape. a man who advocates aesthetic effort and deprecates social effort is only likely to be understood by a class to which social effort has become a stale matter. to argue upon the possibility of culture before luxury to the bucolic world may be to argue truly, but it is an attempt to disturb a sequence to which humanity has been long accustomed. yeobright preaching to the egdon eremites that they might rise to a serene comprehensiveness without going through the process of enriching themselves was not unlike arguing to ancient chaldeans that in ascending from earth to the pure empyrean it was not necessary to pass first into the intervening heaven of ether.

he walked along towards home without attending to paths. if anyone knew the heath well it was clym. he was permeated with its scenes, with its substance, and with its odours. he might be said to be its product. his eyes had first opened thereon; with its appearance all the first images of his memory were mingled, his estimate of life had been coloured by it: his toys had been the flint knives and arrow-heads

â€œi am not going back to paris again, mother,â€ he said. â€œat least, in my old capacity. i have given up the business.â€
mrs. yeobright turned in pained surprise. â€œi thought something was amiss, because of the boxes. i wonder you did not tell me sooner.â€

mrs. yeobright spoke calmly, but the force of feeling behind the words was but too apparent to one who knew her as well as her son did. he did not answer. there was in his face that hopelessness of being understood which comes when the objector is constitutionally beyond the reach of a logic that, even under favouring conditions, is almost too coarse a vehicle for the subtlety of the argument.

now, yeobright, having inherited some of these very instincts from the woman before him, could not fail to awaken a reciprocity in her through her feelings, if not by arguments, disguise it as she might for his good. she spoke with less assurance. â€œand yet you might have been a wealthy man if you had only persevered. manager to that large diamond establishmentâ€”what better can a man wish for? what a post of trust and respect! i suppose you will be like your father; like him, you are getting weary of doing

it was the custom on egdon to begin the preface to a story before absolutely entering the house, so as to be well in for the body of the narrative by the time visitor and visited stood face to face. christian had been saying to them while the door was leaving its latch, â€œto think that i, who go from ho

â€œgood heaven, how horrid!â€ said mrs. yeobright.
â€œsue pricked her that deep that the maid fainted away; and as i was afeard there might be some tumult among us, i got behind the bass viol and didnâ€™t see no more. but they carried her out into the air, â€˜tis said; but when they looked round for sue she was gone. what a scream that girl gied, poor thing! there were the paâ€™son in his surplice holding up his hand and saying, â€˜sit down, my good people, sit down!â€™ but the deuce a bit would they sit down. o, and what dâ€™ye think i found

â€œâ€˜tis a cruel thing,â€ said yeobright.
â€œyes,â€ said his mother.
â€œthe nation ought to look into it,â€ said christian. â€œhereâ€™s humphrey coming, i think.â€
in came humphrey. â€œwell, have ye heard the news? but i see you have. â€˜tis a very strange thing that whenever one of egdon folk goes to church some rum job or other is sure to be doing. the last time one of us was there was when neighbour fairway went in the fall; and that was the day you forbad the banns, mrs. yeobright.â€
â€œhas this cruelly treated girl been able

â€œthey say she got better, and went home very well. and now iâ€™ve told it i must be moving homeward myself.â€
â€œand i,â€ said humphrey. â€œtruly now we shall see if thereâ€™s anything in what folks say about her.â€
when they were gone into the heath again yeobright said quietly to his mother, â€œdo you think i have turned teacher too soon?â€
â€œit is right that there should be schoolmasters, and missionaries, and all such men,â€ she replied. â€œbut it is right, too, that i should try to lift you out of this life into something richer, and that you should not come back again, and be as if i had not tried at all.â€
later in the day sam, the turf-cutter, entered. â€œiâ€™ve come a-borrowing, mrs. yeobright. i suppose you have heard whatâ€™s been happening

to the beauty on the hill?â€
â€œyes, sam: half a dozen have been telling us.â€
â€œbeauty?â€ said clym.
â€œyes, tolerably well-favoured,â€ sam replied. â€œlord! all the country owns that â€˜tis one of the strangest things in the world that such a woman should have come to live up there.â€
â€œdark or fair?â€
â€œnow, though iâ€™ve seen her twenty times, thatâ€™s a thing i cannot call to mind.â€
â€œdarker than tamsin,â€ murmured mrs. yeobright.
â€œa woman who seems to care for nothing at all, as you may say.â€
â€œshe is melancholy, then?â€ inquired clym.
â€œshe mopes about by herself, and donâ€™t mix in with the people.â€
â€œis she a young lady inclined for adventures?â€
â€œnot to my knowledge.â€
â€œdoesnâ€™t join in with the lads in their games, to get some sort of excitement in this lonely place?â€
â€œno.â€
â€œmumming, for instance?â€
â€œno. her notions be different. i should rather say her thoughts were far away from here,

 with lords and ladies sheâ€™ll never know, and mansions sheâ€™ll never see again.â€
observing that clym appeared singularly interested mrs. yeobright said rather uneasily to sam, â€œyou see more in her than most of us do. miss vye is to my mind too idle to be charming. i have never heard that she is of any use to herself or to other people. good girls donâ€™t get treated as witches even on egdon.â€
â€œnonsenseâ€”that proves nothing either way,â€ said yeobright.
â€œwell, of course i donâ€™t understand such niceties,â€ said sam, withdrawing from a possibly unpleasant argument; â€œand what she is we must wait for time to tell us. the business that i have really called about is this, to borrow the longest and strongest rope you have. the captainâ€™s bucket has dropped into the well, and they are in want of water; and as all the chaps are at home today we think we can get it out for him. we have three cart-ropes already, but they wonâ€™t reach to the bot

mrs. yeobright told him that he might have whatever ropes he could find in the outhouse, and sam went out to search. when he passed by the door clym joined him, and accompanied him to the gate.
â€œis this young witch-lady going to stay long at mistover?â€ he asked.
â€œi should say so.â€
â€œwhat a cruel shame to ill-use her, she must have suffered greatlyâ€”more in mind than in body.â€
â€œâ€˜twas a graceless trickâ€”such a handsome girl, too. you ought to see her, mr. yeobright, being a young man come from far, and with a little more to show for your years than most of us.â€
â€œdo you think she would like to teach children?â€ said clym.
sam shook his head. â€œquite a different sort of body from that, i reckon.â€
â€œo, it was merely something which occurred to me. it would of course be necessary to see her and talk it overâ€”not an easy thing, by the way, for my family and hers are not very friendly.â€
â€œiâ€™ll tell you how you mid see her, mr. yeobright,â€ said

sam. â€œwe are going to grapple for the bucket at six oâ€™clock tonight at her house, and you could lend a hand. thereâ€™s five or six coming, but the well is deep, and another might be useful, if you donâ€™t mind appearing in that shape. sheâ€™s sure to be walking round.â€
â€œiâ€™ll think of it,â€ said yeobright; and they parted.
he thought of it a good deal; but nothing more was said about eustacia inside the house at that time. whether this romantic martyr to superstition and the melancholy mummer he had conversed with under the full moon were one and the same person remained as yet a problem.




3â€”the first act in a timeworn drama

the afternoon was fine, and yeobright walked on the heath for an hour with his mother. when they reached the lofty ridge which divided the valley of blooms-end from th

e adjoining valley they stood still and looked round. the quiet woman inn was visible on the low margin of the heath in one direction, and afar on the other hand rose mistover knap.
â€œyou mean to call on thomasin?â€ he inquired.
â€œyes. but you need not come this time,â€ said his mother.
â€œin that case iâ€™ll branch off here, mother. i am going to mistover.â€
mrs. yeobright turned to him inquiringly.
â€œi am going to help them get the bucket out of the captainâ€™s well,â€ he continued. â€œas it is so very deep i may be useful. and i should like to see this miss vyeâ€”not so much for her good looks as for another reason.â€
â€œmust you go?â€ his mother asked.
â€œi thought to.â€
and they parted. â€œthere is no help for it,â€ murmured clymâ€™s mother gloomily as he withdrew. â€œthey are sure to see each other. i wish sam would carry his news to other houses than

mine.â€
clymâ€™s retreating figure got smaller and smaller as it rose and fell over the hillocks on his way. â€œhe is tender-hearted,â€ said mrs. yeobright to herself while she watched him; â€œotherwise it would matter little. how heâ€™s going on!â€
he was, indeed, walking with a will over the furze, as straight as a line, as if his life depended upon it. his mother drew a long breath, and, abandoning the visit to thomasin, turned back. the evening films began to make nebulous pictures of the valleys, but the high lands still were raked by the declining rays of the winter sun, which glanced on clym as he walked forward, eyed by every rabbit and f

 hands were stretched out, then jerk went the rope, whizz went the wheel, the two foremost haulers fell backward, the beating of a falling body was heard, receding down the sides of the well, and a thunderous uproar arose at the bottom. the bucket was gone again.
â€œdamn the bucket!â€ said fairway.
â€œlower again,â€ said sam.
â€œiâ€™m as stiff as a ramâ€™s horn stooping so long,â€ said fairway, standing up and stretching himself till his joints creaked.
â€œrest a few minutes, timothy,â€ said yeobright. â€œiâ€™ll take your place.â€
the grapnel was again lowered. its smart impact upon the distant water reached their ears like a kiss, whereupon yeobright knelt down, and leaning over the well began dragging the grapnel round and round as fairway had done.
â€œtie a rope round himâ€”it is dangerous!â€ cried a soft and anxious voice somewhere above them.
everybody turned. the speaker was a woman, gazing down upon the group from an upper window, whose panes blazed in the ruddy glare from the west.

 her lips were parted and she appeared for the moment to forget where she was.
the rope was accordingly tied round his waist, and the work proceeded. at the next haul the weight was not heavy, and it was discovered that they had only secured a coil of the rope detached from the bucket. the tangled mass was thrown into the background. humphrey took yeobrightâ€™s place, and the grapnel was lowered again.
yeobright retired to the heap of recovered rope in a meditative mood. of the identity between the ladyâ€™s voice and that of the melancholy mummer he had not a momentâ€™s doubt. â€œhow thoughtful of her!â€ he said to himself.
eustacia, who had reddened when she perceived the effect of her exclamation upon the group below, was no longer to be seen at the window, though yeobright scanned it wistfully. while he stood there the men at the well succeede

, you will find.â€
however, eustacia had begun to pay out. while he was tying she cried, â€œi cannot stop it!â€
clym ran to her side, and found he could only check the rope by twisting the loose part round the upright post, when it stopped with a jerk. â€œhas it hurt you?â€
â€œyes,â€ she replied.
â€œvery much?â€
â€œno; i think not.â€ she opened her hands. one of them was bleeding; the rope had dragged off the skin. eustacia wrapped it in her handkerchief.
â€œyou should have let go,â€ said yeobright. â€œwhy didnâ€™t you?â€
â€œyou said i was to hold on.... this is the second time i have been wounded today.â€
â€œah, yes; i have heard of it. i blush for my native egdon. was it a serious injury you received in church, miss vye?â€
there was such an abundance of sympathy in clymâ€™s tone that eustacia slowly drew up her sleeve and disclosed her round white arm. a bright red spot appeared on its smooth surface, like a ruby on parian marble.
â€œthere it is,â€ she said, putting her finger again

â€œand you fainted?â€ said clym, looking at the scarlet little puncture as if he would like to kiss it and make it well.
â€œyes, it frightened me. i had not been to church for a long time. and now i shall not go again for ever so longâ€”perhaps never. i cannot face their eyes after this. donâ€™t you think it dreadfully humiliating? i wished i was dead for hours after, but i donâ€™t mind now.â€
â€œi have come to clean away these cobwebs,â€ said yeobright. â€œwould you like to help meâ€”by high-class teaching? we might benefit them much.â€
â€œi donâ€™t quite feel anxious to. i have not much love for my fellow-creatures. sometimes i quite hate them.â€
â€œstill i think that if you were to hear my scheme you might take an interest in it. there is no use in hating peopleâ€”if you hate anything, you should hate what produced them.â€
â€œdo you mean nature? i hate her already. but i shall be glad to hear your scheme at any time.â€

â€œi was not even aware there existed any such curious druidical stone. i am aware that there are boulevards in paris.â€
yeobright looked thoughtfully on the ground. â€œthat means much,â€ he said.
â€œit does indeed,â€ said eustacia.
â€œi remember when i had the same longing for town bustle. five years of a great city would be a perfect cure for that.â€
â€œheaven send me such a cure! now, mr. yeobright, i will go indoors and plaster my wounded hand.â€
they separated, and eustacia vanished in the increasing shade. she seemed full of many things. her past was a blank, her life had begun. the effect upon clym of this meeting he did not fully discover till some time after. during his walk home his most intelligible sensation was that his scheme had somehow become glorified. a beautiful woman had been intertwined with it.
on reaching the house he went up to the room which was to be made his study

â€œi wondered if you had.â€
â€œit was no appointment.â€
â€œno; such meetings never are.â€
â€œbut you are not angry, mother?â€
â€œi can hardly say that i am not. angry? no. but when i consider the usual nature of the drag which causes men of promise to disappoint the world i feel uneasy.â€
â€œyou deserve credit for the feeling, mother. but i can assure you that you need not be disturbed by it on my account.â€
â€œwhen i think of you and your new crotchets,â€ said mrs. yeobright, with some emphasis, â€œi naturally donâ€™t feel so comfortable as i did a twelvemonth ago. it is incredible to me that a man accustomed to the attractive women of paris and elsewhere should be so easily worked upon by a girl in a heath. you could just as well have walked another way.â€
â€œi had been studying all day.â€
â€œwell, yes,â€ she added more hopefully, â€œi have been thinking that you might get on as a schoolmaster, and rise that way, since you really are determined to hate the cour

orse, as the case may be.
the love between the young man and his mother was strangely invisible now. of love it may be said, the less earthly the less demonstrative. in its absolutely indestructible form it reaches a profundity in which all exhibition of itself is painful. it was so with these. had conversations between them been overheard, people would have said, â€œhow cold they are to each other!â€
his theory and his wishes about devoting his future to teaching had made an impression on mrs. yeobright. indeed, how could it be otherwise when he was a part of herâ€”when their discourses were as if carried on between the right and the left hands of the same body? he had despaired of reaching her by argument; and it was almost as a discovery to him that he could reach her by a magnetism which was as superior to words as words are to yells.
strangely enough he began to feel now that it would not be so hard to persuade her who was his best friend that comparative poverty was essentially the higher

what was the great world to mrs. yeobright? a multitude whose tendencies could be perceived, though not its essences. communities were seen by her as from a distance; she saw them as we see the throngs which cover the canvases of sallaert, van alsloot, and others of that schoolâ€”vast masses of beings, jostling, zigzagging, and processioning in definite directions, but whose features are indistinguishable by the very comprehensiveness of the view.

philosophy of her nature, and its limitation by circumstances, was almost written in her movements. they had a majestic foundation, though they were far from being majestic; and they had a ground-work of assurance, but they were not assured. as her once elastic walk had become deadened by time, so had her natural pride of life been hindered in its blooming by her necessities.
the next slight touch in the shaping of clymâ€™s destiny occurred a few days after. a barrow was opened on the heath, and yeobright attended the operation, remaining away from his study during several hours. in the afternoon christian returned from a journey in the same direction, and mrs. yeobright questioned him.
â€œthey have dug a hole, and they have found things like flowerpots upside down, misâ€™ess yeobright; and inside these be real charnel bones. they have carried â€˜em off to menâ€™s houses; but i shouldnâ€™t like to sleep where they will bide. dead folks have been known to come and claim their own. mr. yeobright h

â€œgave it away?â€
â€œyes. to miss vye. she has a cannibal taste for such churchyard furniture seemingly.â€
â€œmiss vye was there too?â€
â€œay, â€˜a bâ€™lieve she was.â€
when clym came home, which was shortly after, his mother said, in a curious tone, â€œthe urn you had meant for me you gave away.â€

made noises in his observation, would gradually disclose a state of great animation when silently watched awhile. a timid animal world had come to life for the season. little tadpoles and efts began to bubble up through the water, and to race along beneath it; toads made noises like very young ducks, and advanced to the margin in twos and threes; overhead, bumblebees flew hither and thither in the thickening light, their drone coming and going like the sound of a gong.
on an evening such as this yeobright descended into the blooms-end valley from beside that very pool, where he had been standing with another person quite silently and quite long enough to hear all this puny stir of resurrection in nature; yet he had not heard it. his walk was rapid as he came down, and he went with a springy trend. before entering upon his motherâ€™s premises he stopped and breathed. the light which shone forth on him from the window revealed that his face was flushed and his eye bright. what it did not show was

ntered soon after. the tea was ready, and he sat down opposite his mother. she did not speak many words; and as for him, something had been just done and some words had been just said on the hill which prevented him from beginning a desultory chat. his motherâ€™s taciturnity was not without ominousness, but he appeared not to care. he knew why she said so little, but he could not remove the cause of her bearing towards him. these half-silent sittings were far from uncommon with them now. at last yeobright made a beginning of what was intended to strike at the whole root of the matter.
â€œfive days have we sat like this at meals with scarcely a word. whatâ€™s the use of it, mother?â€
â€œnone,â€ said she, in a heart-swollen tone. â€œbut there is only too good a reason.â€
â€œnot when you know all. i have been wanting to speak about this, and i am glad the subject is begun. the reason, of course, is eustacia vye. well, i confess i have seen her lately, and have seen her a good many times.â€

ll i wish to do is to save you from sorrow? for shame, clym! but it is all through that womanâ€”a hussy!â€
clym reddened like fire and rose. he placed his hand upon his motherâ€™s shoulder and said, in a tone which hung strangely between entreaty and command, â€œi wonâ€™t hear it. i may be led to answer you in a way which we shall both regret.â€
his mother parted her lips to begin some other vehement truth, but on looking at him she saw that in his face which led her to leave the words unsaid. yeobright walked once or twice across the room, and then suddenly went out of the house. it was eleven oâ€™clock when he came in, though he had not been further than the precincts of the garden. his mother was gone to bed. a light was left burning on the table, and supper was spread. without stopping for any food he secured the doors and went upstairs.

the next day was gloomy enough at blooms-end. yeobright remained in his study, sitting over the open b

ant. determined that there should be nothing in his conduct towards his mother resembling sullenness, he had occasionally spoken to her on passing matters, and would take no notice of the brevity of her replies. with the same resolve to keep up a show of conversation he said, about seven oâ€™clock in the evening, â€œthereâ€™s an eclipse of the moon tonight. i am going out to see it.â€ and, putting on his overcoat, he left her.
the low moon was not as yet visible from the front of the house, and yeobright climbed out of the valley until he stood in the full flood of her light. but even now he walked on, and his steps were in the direction of rainbarrow.
in half an hour he stood at the top. the sky was clear from verge to verge, and the moon flung her rays over the whole heath, but without sensibly lighting it, except where paths and water-courses had laid bare the white flints and glistening quartz sand, which made streaks upon the general shade. after standing awhile he stooped and felt the hea

s, and the wondrous ring mountainsâ€”till he almost felt himself to be voyaging bodily through its wild scenes, standing on its hollow hills, traversing its deserts, descending its vales and old sea bottoms, or mounting to the edges of its craters.
while he watched the far-removed landscape a tawny stain grew into being on the lower vergeâ€”the eclipse had begun. this marked a preconcerted momentâ€”for the remote celestial phenomenon had been pressed into sublunary service as a loverâ€™s signal. yeobrightâ€™s mind flew back to earth at the sight; he arose, shook himself and listened. minute after minute passed by, perhaps ten minutes passed, and the shadow on the moon perceptibly widened. he heard a rustling on his left hand, a cloaked figure with an upturned face appeared at the base of the barrow, and clym descended. in a moment the figure was in his arms, and his lips upon hers.
â€œmy eustacia!â€

â€œi began to wonder why you did not come,â€ said yeobright, when she had withdrawn a little from his embrace.
â€œyou said ten minutes after the first mark of shade on the edge of the moon, and thatâ€™s what it is now.â€
â€œwell, let us only think that here we are.â€
then, holding each otherâ€™s hand, they were again silent, and the shadow on the moonâ€™s disc grew a little larger.

â€œit has seemed sad.â€
â€œand not long? thatâ€™s because you occupy yourself, and so blind yourself to my absen

â€œon sundays.â€
â€œah, yes. i dislike english sundays. how i should chime in with their manners over there! dear clym, youâ€™ll go back again?â€
clym shook his head, and looked at the eclipse.
â€œif youâ€™ll go back again iâ€™llâ€”be something,â€ she said tenderly, putting her head near his breast. â€œif youâ€™ll agree iâ€™ll give my promise, without making you wait a minute longer.â€
â€œhow extraordinary that you and my mother should be of one mind about this!â€ said yeobright. â€œi have vowed not to go back, eustacia. it is not the place i dislike; it is the occupation.â€
â€œbut you can go in some other capacity.â€
â€œno. besides, it would interfere with my scheme. donâ€™t press that, eustacia. will you marry me?â€
â€œi cannot tell.â€
â€œnowâ€”never mind paris; it is no better than other spots. promise, sweet!â€
â€œyou will never adhere to your education plan, i am quite sure; and then it will be all right for me; and so i promise to be yours for ever and ever.

to his return to the french capital, this was what she secretly longed for in the event of marriage; and it robbed him of many an otherwise pleasant hour. along with that came the widening breach between himself and his mother. whenever any little occurrence had brought into more prominence than usual the disappointment that he was causing her it had sent him on lone and moody walks; or he was kept awake a great part of the night by the turmoil of spirit which such a recognition created. if mrs. yeobright could only have been led to see what a sound and worthy purpose this purpose of his was and how little it was being affected by his devotions to eustacia, how differently would she regard him!
thus as his sight grew accustomed to the first blinding halo kindled about him by love and beauty, yeobright began to perceive what a strait he was in. sometimes he wished that he had never known eustacia, immediately to retract the wish as brutal. three antagonistic growths had to be kept alive: his moth

ld hope to preserve. though his love was as chaste as that of petrarch for his laura, it had made fetters of what previously was only a difficulty. a position which was not too simple when he stood whole-hearted had become indescribably complicated by the addition of eustacia. just when his mother was beginning to tolerate one scheme he had introduced another still bitterer than the first, and the combination was more than she could bear.




5â€”sharp words are spoken, and a crisis ensues

when yeobright was not with eustacia he was sitting slavishly over his books; when he was not reading he was meeting her. these meetings were carried on with the greatest secrecy.
one afternoon his mother came home from a morning visit to thomasin. he could see from a disturbance in the lines of her face that something had happened.
â€œi have been told an incomprehensible thing,â€ she said mournfully. â€œthe captain has let out at the woman that you and eustacia vye are engaged to be married.â€
â€œwe are,â€

â€œi should hardly think it would be yet for a very long time! you will take her to paris, i suppose?â€ she spoke with weary hopelessness.
â€œi am not going back to paris.â€
â€œwhat will you do with a wife, then?â€
â€œkeep a school in budmouth, as i have told you.â€
â€œthatâ€™s incredible! the place is overrun with schoolmasters. you have no special qualifications. what possible chance is there for such as you?â€

â€œclym,â€ said his mother with firmness, â€œi have no proofs against her, unfortunately. but if she makes you a good wife, there has never been a bad one.â€
â€œbelieve me, you are almost exasperating,â€ said yeobright vehemently. â€œand this very day i had intended to arrange a meeting between you. but you give me no peace; you try to thwart my wishes in everything.â€
â€œi hate the thought of any son of mine marrying badly! i wish i had never lived to see this; it is too much for meâ€”it is more than i dreamt!â€ she turned to the window. her breath was coming quickly, and her lips were pale, parted, and trembling.

mrs. yeobright remained for some time silent and shaken, as if she could say no more. then she replied, â€œbest? is it best for you to injure your prospects for such a voluptuous, idle woman as that? donâ€™t you see that by the very fact of your choosing her you prove that you do not know what is best for you? you give up your whole thoughtâ€”you set your whole soulâ€”to please a woman.â€
â€œi do. and that woman is you.â€

it was a sunny afternoon at the beginning of summer, and the moist hollows of the heath had passed from their brown to their green stage. yeobright walked to the edge of the basin which extended down from mistover and rainbarrow.
by this time he was calm, and he looked over the landscape. in the minor valleys, between the hillocks which diversified the contour of the vale, the fresh young ferns were luxuriantly growing up, ultimately to reach a height of five or six feet. he descended a little way, flung himself down in a spot where a path emerged from one of the small hollows, and waited. hither it was that he had promised eustacia to bri

e stillness was unbroken. lizards, grasshoppers, and ants were the only living things to be beheld. the scene seemed to belong to the ancient world of the carboniferous period, when the forms of plants were few, and of the fern kind; when there was neither bud nor blossom, nothing but a monotonous extent of leafage, amid which no bird sang.
when he had reclined for some considerable time, gloomily pondering, he discerned above the ferns a drawn bonnet of white silk approaching from the left, and yeobright knew directly that it covered the head of her he loved. his heart awoke from its apathy to a warm excitement, and, jumping to his feet, he said aloud, â€œi knew she was sure to come.â€
she vanished in a hollow for a few moments, and then her whole form unfolded itself from the brake.
â€œonly you here?â€ she exclaimed, with a disappointed air, whose hollowness was proved by her rising redness and her half-guilty low laugh. â€œwhere is mrs. yeobright?â€
â€œshe has not come,â€ he replied in a

woman to him, a being to fight for, support, help, be maligned for. now that he had reached a cooler moment he would have preferred a less hasty marriage; but the card was laid, and he determined to abide by the game. whether eustacia was to add one other to the list of those who love too hotly to love long and well, the forthcoming event was certainly a ready way of proving.




6â€”yeobright goes, and the breach is complete

all that evening smart sounds denoting an active packing up came from yeobrightâ€™s room to the ears of his mother downstairs.
next morning he departed from the house and again proceeded across the heath. a long dayâ€™s march was before him, his object being to secure a dwelling to which he might take eustacia when she became his wife. such a house, small, secluded, and with its windows boarded up, he had casually observed a month earlier, about two miles beyond the village of east egdon, and six miles distant altogether; and thither he directed his steps today.

yet a few yards to yeobrightâ€™s left, on the open heath, how ineffectively gnashed the storm! those gusts which tore the trees merely waved the furze and heather in a light caress. egdon was made for such times as these.
yeobright reached the empty house about midday. it was almost as lonely as that of eustaciaâ€™s grandfather, but the fact that it stood near a heath was disguised by a belt of firs which almost enclosed the premises. he journeyed on about a mile further to the village in which the owner lived, and, return

it now only remained to wish his mother good-bye. she was sitting by the window as usual when he came downstairs.
â€œmother, i am going to leave you,â€ he said, holding out his hand.
â€œi thought you were, by your packing,â€ replied mrs. yeobright in a voice from which every particle of emotion was painfully excluded.
â€œand you will part friends with me?â€
â€œcertainly, clym.â€
â€œi am going to be married on the twenty-fifth.â€
â€œi thought you were going to be married.â€
â€œand thenâ€”and then you must come and see us. you will understand me better after that, and our situation will not be so wretched as it is now.â€
â€œi do not think it likely i shall come to see you.â€

he kissed her cheek, and departed in great misery, which was several hours in lessening itself to a controllable level. the position had been such that nothing more could be said without, in the first place, breaking down a barrier; and that was not to be done.
no sooner had yeobright gone from his motherâ€™s house than her face changed its rigid aspect for one of blank despair. after a while she wept, and her tears brought some relief. during the rest of the day she did nothing but walk up and down the garden path in a state bordering on stupefaction. night came, and with it but little rest. the next day, with an instinct to do something which should reduce prostration to mournfulness, she went to her sonâ€™s room, and with her own hands arranged it in order, for an imagina

â€œhe is very well.â€

â€œyes, aunt. i would tell you if he were unkind.â€ she added, blushing, and with hesitation, â€œheâ€”i donâ€™t know if i ought to complain to you about this, but i am not quite sure what to do. i want some money, you know, auntâ€”some to buy little things for myselfâ€”and he doesnâ€™t give me any. i donâ€™t

â€œvery well, i will.... aunt, i have heard about clym. i know you are in trouble about him, and thatâ€™s why i have come.â€
mrs. yeobright turned away, and her features worked in her attempt to conceal her feelings. then she ceased to make any attempt, and said, weeping, â€œo thomasin, do you think he hates me? how can he bear to grieve me so, when i have lived only for him through all these years?â€
â€œhate youâ€”no,â€ said thomasin soothingly. â€œit is only that he loves her too well. look at it quietlyâ€”do. it is not so very bad of him. do you know, i thought it not the worst match he could have made. miss vyeâ€™s family is

and for one week thomasin literally fulfilled her word. she endeavoured to make light of the wedding; and brought news of the preparations, and that she was invited to be present. the next week she was rather unwell, and did not appear. nothing had as yet been done about the guineas, for thomasin feared to address her husband again on the subject, and mrs. yeobright had insisted upon this.
one day just before this time wildeve was standing at the door of the quiet woman. in addition to the upward path through the heath to rainbarrow and mistover, there was a road which branched from the highway a short distance below the inn, and ascended to mistover by a circuitous and easy incline. this was the only route on that side for vehicles to the captainâ€™s retreat. a light cart from the nearest town descended the road, and the lad who was driving pulled up in f

â€œyes. they are taking in good things up there. going to be a wedding.â€ and the driver buried his face in his mug.
wildeve had not received an inkling of the fact before, and a sudden expression of pain overspread his face. he turned for a moment into the passage to hide it. then he came back again.
â€œdo you mean miss vye?â€ he said. â€œhow is itâ€”that she can be married so soon?â€
â€œby the will of god and a ready young man, i suppose.â€
â€œyou donâ€™t mean mr. yeobright?â€
â€œyes. he has been creeping about with her all the spring.â€
â€œi supposeâ€”she was immensely taken with him?â€
â€œshe is crazy about him, so their general servant of all work tells me. and that lad charley that looks after the horse is all in a daze about it. the stun-poll has got fond-like of her.â€

7â€”the morning and the evening of a day

the wedding morning came. nobody would have imagined from appearances that blooms-end had any interest in mistover that day. a solemn stillness prevailed around the house of clymâ€™s mother, and there was no more animation indoors. mrs. yeobright, who had declined to attend the ceremony, sat by the breakfast table in the old room which communicated immediately with the porch, her eyes listlessly directed towards the open door. it was the room in which, six months earlier, the merry christmas party had met, to which eustacia came secretly and as a stranger. the only living thing that entered now was a sparrow; and seeing no movements to cause alarm, he hopped boldly round the room, endeavoured to go out by the window, and fluttered among

 the pot-flowers. this roused the lonely sitter, who got up, released the bird, and went to the door. she was expecting thomasin, who had written the night before to state that the time had come when she would wish to have the money and that she would if possible call this day.
yet thomasin occupied mrs. yeobrightâ€™s thoughts but slightly as she looked up the valley of the heath, alive with butterflies, and with grasshoppers whose husky noises on every side formed a whispered chorus. a domestic drama, for which the preparations were now being made a mile or two off, was but little less vividly present to her eyes than if enacted before her. she tried to dismiss the vision, and walked about the garden plot; but her eyes ever and anon sought out the direction of the parish church to which mistover belonge

 with it the notes of distant bells, gaily starting off in a peal: one, two, three, four, five. the ringers at east egdon were announcing the nuptials of eustacia and her son.
â€œthen it is over,â€ she murmured. â€œwell, well! and life too will be over soon. and why should i go on scalding my face like this? cry about one thing in life, cry about all; one thread runs through the whole piece. and yet we say, â€˜a time to laugh!â€™â€
towards evening wildeve came. since thomasinâ€™s marriage mrs. yeobright had shown him that grim friendliness which at last arises in all such cases of undesired affinity. the vision of what ought to have been is thrown aside in sheer weariness, and browbeaten human endeavour listlessly makes the best of the fact that is. wildeve, to do him justice, had behaved very courteously to his wifeâ€™s aunt; and it was with no surprise that she saw him enter now.
â€œthomasin has not been able to come, as she promised to do,â€ he replied to her inquiry, which had been anxiou

s, for she knew that her niece was badly in want of money. â€œthe captain came down last night and personally pressed her to join them today. so, not to be unpleasant, she determined to go. they fetched her in the pony-chaise, and are going to bring her back.â€
â€œthen it is done,â€ said mrs. yeobright. â€œhave they gone to their new home?â€
â€œi donâ€™t know. i have had no news from mistover since thomasin left to go.â€
â€œyou did not go with her?â€ said she, as if there might be good reasons why.
â€œi could not,â€ said wildeve, reddening slightly. â€œwe could not both leave the house; it was rather a busy morning, on account of anglebury great market. i believe you have something to give to thomasin? if you like, i will take it.â€
mrs. yeobright hesitated, and wondered if wildeve knew

ou need think no such thing,â€ said she drily. â€œit is simply that i, in common with the rest of the world, feel that there are certain things which had better be done by certain people than by others.â€
â€œas you like, as you like,â€ said wildeve laconically. â€œit is not worth arguing about. well, i think i must turn homeward again, as the inn must not be left long in charge of the lad and the maid only.â€
he went his way, his farewell being scarcely so courteous as his greeting. but mrs. yeobright knew him thoroughly by this time, and took little notice of his manner, good or bad.
when wildeve was gone mrs. yeobright stood and considered what would be the best course to adopt with regard to the guineas, which she had not liked to entrust to wildeve. it was hardly credible that thomasin had told him to ask for them, when the necessity for them had arisen from the difficulty of obtaining money at his hands. at the same time thomasin really wanted them, and might be unable to come to blooms

ft, of showing how far she was from bearing him ill-will, cheered the sad motherâ€™s heart.
she went upstairs and took from a locked drawer a little box, out of which she poured a hoard of broad unworn guineas that had lain there many a year. there were a hundred in all, and she divided them into two heaps, fifty in each. tying up these in small canvas bags, she went down to the garden and called to christian cantle, who was loitering about in hope of a supper which was not really owed him. mrs. yeobright gave him the moneybags, charged him to go to mistover, and on no account to deliver them into any oneâ€™s hands save her sonâ€™s and thomasinâ€™s. on further thought she deemed it advisable to tell christian precisely what the two bags contained, that he might be fully impressed with their importance. christian pocketed the moneybags, promised the greatest carefulness, and set out on his way.
â€œyou need not hurry,â€ said mrs. yeobright. â€œit will be better not to get there till after dusk, a

eh?â€ he tapped one of his money-laden boots upon the floor.
â€œwhat do you mean?â€ said wildeve.
â€œthatâ€™s a secret. well, i must be going now.â€ he looked anxiously towards fairway.
â€œwhere are you going?â€ wildeve asked.
â€œto mistover knap. i have to see mrs. thomasin thereâ€”thatâ€™s all.â€
â€œi am going there, too, to fetch mrs. wildeve. we can walk together.â€
wildeve became lost in thought, and a look of inward illumination came into his eyes. it was money for his wife that mrs. yeobright could not trust him with. â€œyet she could trust this fellow,â€ he said to himself. â€œwhy doesnâ€™t that which belongs to the wife belong to the husband too?â€
he called to the pot-boy to bring him his hat, and said, â€œnow, christian, i am ready.â€
â€œmr. wildeve,â€ said christian timidly, as he turned to leave the room, â€œwould you mind lending me them wonderful little things that carry my luck inside â€˜em, that i might practise a bit by myself, you know?â€ he looked wistfully at the

e be one flesh, â€˜twould have been all the same, i should think,â€ said christian. â€œbut my strict documents was, to give the money into mrs. wildeveâ€™s handâ€”and â€˜tis well to do things right.â€
â€œno doubt,â€ said wildeve. any person who had known the circumstances might have perceived that wildeve was mortified by the discovery that the matter in transit was money, and not, as he had supposed when at blooms-end, some fancy nick-nack which only interested the two women themselves. mrs. yeobrightâ€™s refusal implied that his honour was not considered to be of sufficiently good quality to make him a safer bearer of his wifeâ€™s property.
â€œhow very warm it is tonight, christian!â€ he said, panting, when they were nearly under rainbarrow. â€œlet us sit down for a few minutes, for heavenâ€™s sake.â€
wildeve flung himself down on the soft ferns; and christian, placing the lantern and parcel on the ground, perched himself in a cramped position hard by, his knees almost touching his chin.

le with a married ladyâ€™s money when, if i win, i shall only keep my winnings, and give her her own all the same; and if tâ€™other man wins, her money will go to the lawful owner?â€
â€œnone at all.â€
wildeve had been brooding ever since they started on the mean estimation in which he was held by his wifeâ€™s friends; and it cut his heart severely. as the minutes passed he had gradually drifted into a revengeful intention without knowing the precise moment of forming it. this was to teach mrs. yeobright a lesson, as he considered it to be; in other words, to show her if he could that her nieceâ€™s husband was the proper guardian of her nieceâ€™s money.
â€œwell, here goes!â€ said christian, beginning to unlace one boot. â€œi shall dream of it nights and nights, i suppose; but i shall always swear my flesh donâ€™t crawl when i think oâ€™t!â€
he thrust his hand into the boot and withdrew one of poor thomasinâ€™s precious guineas, piping hot. wildeve had already placed a sovereign on the stone.

time passed on. wildeve began to be as excited as christian himself. when commencing the game his intention had been nothing further than a bitter practical joke on mrs. yeobright. to win the money, fairly or otherwise, and to hand it contemptuously to thomasin in her auntâ€™s presence, had been the dim outline of his purpose. but men are drawn from their intentions even in the course of carrying them out, and it was extremely doubtful, by the time the twentieth guinea had been reached, whether wildeve was conscious of any other intention than that of winning for his own personal benefit. moreover, he was now no longer gambling for his wifeâ€™s money, but for yeobrightâ€

it was nearly eleven oâ€™clock, when, with almost a shriek, christian placed yeobrightâ€™s last gleaming guinea upon the stone. in thirty seconds it had gone the way of its companions.
christian turned and flung himself on the ferns in a convulsion of remorse, â€œo, what shall i do with my wretched self?â€ he groaned. â€œwhat shall i do? will any good heaven hae mercy upon my wicked soul?â€
â€œdo? live on just the same.â€
â€œi wonâ€™t live on just the same! iâ€™ll die! i say you are aâ€”aâ€”â€”â€
â€œa man sharper than my neighbour.â€
â€œyes, a man sharper than my neighbour;

â€œpoor chips-in-porridge, you are very unmannerly.â€
â€œi donâ€™t know about that! and i say you be unmannerly! youâ€™ve got money that isnâ€™t your own. half the guineas are poor mr. clymâ€™s.â€
â€œhowâ€™s that?â€
â€œbecause i had to gie fifty of â€˜em to him. mrs. yeobright said so.â€
â€œoh?... well, â€˜twould have been more graceful of her to have given them to his wife eustacia. but they are in my hands now.â€
christian pulled on his boots, and with heavy breathings, which could be heard to some distance, dragged his limbs together, arose, and tottered away out of sight. wildeve set about shutting the lantern to return to the house, for he deemed it too late to go to mistover to meet his wife, who was to be driven home in the captainâ€™s four-wheel. while he w

e extinguished lantern in his hand, went towards the highroad. on reaching it he stood still. the silence of night pervaded the whole heath except in one direction; and that was towards mistover. there he could hear the noise of light wheels, and presently saw two carriagelamps descending the hill. wildeve screened himself under a bush and waited.
the vehicle came on and passed before him. it was a hired carriage, and behind the coachman were two persons whom he knew well. there sat eustacia and yeobright, the arm of the latter being round her waist. they turned the sharp corner at the bottom towards the temporary home which clym had hired and furnished, about five miles to the eastward.
wildeve forgot the loss of the money at the sight of his lost love, whose preciousness in his eyes was increasing in geometrical progression with each new incident that reminded him of their hopeless division. brimming with the subtilized misery that he was capable of feeling, he followed the opposite way toward

eustacia started when the lamp shone upon him, and clymâ€™s arm was involuntarily withdrawn from her waist. he said, â€œwhat, diggory? you are having a lonely walk.â€
â€œyesâ€”i beg your pardon for stopping you,â€ said venn. â€œbut i am waiting about for mrs. wildeve: i have something to give her from mrs. yeobright. can you tell me if sheâ€™s gone home from the party yet?â€
â€œno. but she will be leaving soon. you may possibly meet her at the corner.â€
venn made a farewell obeisance, and walked back to his former position, where the byroad from mistover joined the highway. here he remained fixed for nearly half an hour, and then another pair of lights came down the hill. it was the old-fashioned wheeled nondescript belonging to the captain, and thomasin sat in it alone, driven by charley.

thomasin recovered from her surprise, and took the packet. â€œthatâ€™s all, maâ€™amâ€”i wish you good night,â€ he said, and vanished from her view.
thus venn, in his anxiety to rectify matters, had placed in thomasinâ€™s hands not only the fifty guineas which rightly belonged to her, but also the fifty intended for her cousin clym. his mistake had been based upon wildeveâ€

ined they were charmed, because they could remain indoors together all day with such a show of reason; when it was fine they were charmed, because they could sit together on the hills. they were like those double stars which revolve round and round each other, and from a distance appear to be one. the absolute solitude in which they lived intensified their reciprocal thoughts; yet some might have said that it had the disadvantage of consuming their mutual affections at a fearfully prodigal rate. yeobright did not fear for his own part; but recollection of eustaciaâ€™s old speech about the evanescence of love, now apparently forgotten by her, sometimes caused him to ask himself a question; and he recoiled at the thought that the quality of finiteness was not foreign to eden.
when three or four weeks had been passed thus, yeobright resumed his reading in earnest. to make up for lost time he studied indefatigably, for he wished to enter his new profession with the least possible delay.

aâ€™s dream had always been that, once married to clym, she would have the power of inducing him to return to paris. he had carefully withheld all promise to do so; but would he be proof against her coaxing and argument? she had calculated to such a degree on the probability of success that she had represented paris, and not budmouth, to her grandfather as in all likelihood their future home. her hopes were bound up in this dream. in the quiet days since their marriage, when yeobright had been poring over her lips, her eyes, and the lines of her face, she had mused and mused on the subject, even while in the act of returning his gaze; and now the sight of the books, indicating a future which was antagonistic to her dream, struck her with a positively painful jar. she was hoping for the time when, as the mistress of some pretty establishment, however small, near a parisian boulevard, she would be passing her days on the skirts at least of the gay world, and catching stray waf

her anxiety reached a high pitch; but there was something in clymâ€™s undeviating manner which made her hesitate before sounding him on the subject. at this point in their experience, however, an incident helped her. it occurred one evening about six weeks after their union, and arose entirely out of the unconscious misapplication of venn of th

therefore, when a week or two had passed away, mrs. yeobright began to wonder why she never heard from her son of the receipt of the present; and to add gloom to her perplexity came the possibility that resentment might be the cause of his silence. she could hardly believe as much, but why did he not write? she questioned christian, and the confusion in his answers would at once have led her to believe that something was wrong, had not one-half of his story been corroborated by thomasinâ€™s note.

when christian learnt where she was going his concern reached its height. at the moment of her departure he could prevaricate no longer, and, confessing to the gambling, told her the truth as far as he knew itâ€”that the guineas had been won by wildeve.
â€œwhat, is he going to keep them?â€ mrs. yeobright cried.

to mrs. yeobright, as soon as she could calmly reflect, there was much likelihood in this, for she could hardly believe that wildeve would really appropriate money belonging to her son. the intermediate course of giving it to eustacia was the sort of thing to please wildeveâ€™s fancy. but it filled the mother with anger none the less. that wildeve should have got command of the guineas after all, and should rearrange the disposal of them, placing clymâ€™s share in clymâ€™s wifeâ€™s hands, because she had been hi

she instantly dismissed the wretched christian from her employ for his conduct in the affair; but, feeling quite helpless and unable to do without him, told him afterwards that he might stay a little longer if he chose. then she hastened off to eustacia, moved by a much less promising emotion towards her daughter-in-law than she had felt half an hour earlier, when planning her journey. at that time it was to inquire in a friendly spirit if there had been any accidental loss; now

 it was to ask plainly if wildeve had privately given her money which had been intended as a sacred gift to clym.
she started at two oâ€™clock, and her meeting with eustacia was hastened by the appearance of the young lady beside the pool and bank which bordered her grandfatherâ€™s premises, where she stood surveying the scene, and perhaps thinking of the romantic enactments it had witnessed in past days. when mrs. yeobright approached, eustacia surveyed her with the calm stare of a stranger.
the mother-in-law was the first to speak. â€œi was coming to see you,â€ she said.
â€œindeed!â€ said eustacia with surprise, for mrs. yeobright, much to the girlâ€™s mortification, had refused to be present at the wedding. â€œi did not at all expect you.â€
â€œi was coming on business only,â€ said the visitor, more coldly than at first. â€œwill you excuse my asking thisâ€”have you received a gift from thomasinâ€™s husband?â€

â€œa gift?â€
â€œi mean money!â€
â€œwhatâ€”i myself?â€
â€œwell, i meant yourself, privatelyâ€”though i was not going to put it in that way.â€
â€œmoney from mr. wildeve? noâ€”never! madam, what do you mean by that?â€ eustacia fired up all too quickly, for her own consciousness of the old attachment between herself and wildeve led her to jump to the conclusion that mrs. yeobright also knew of it, and might have come to accuse her of receiving dishonourable presents from him now.
â€œi simply ask the question,â€ said mrs. yeobright. â€œi have beenâ€”â€”â€
â€œyou ought to have better opinions of meâ€”i feared you were against me from the first!â€ exclaimed eustacia.
â€œno. i was simply for clym,â€ replied mrs. yeobright, with too much emphasis in her earnestness. â€œit is the instinct of everyone to look after their own.â€
â€œhow can you imply that he required guardin

g against me?â€ cried eustacia, passionate tears in her eyes. â€œi have not injured him by marrying him! what sin have i done that you should think so ill of me? you had no right to speak against me to him when i have never wronged you.â€
â€œi only did what was fair under the circumstances,â€ said mrs. yeobright more softly. â€œi would rather not have gone into this question at present, but you compel me. i am not ashamed to tell you the honest truth. i was firmly convinced that he ought not to marry youâ€”therefore i tried to dissuade him by all the means in my power. but it is done now, and i have no idea of complaining any more. i am ready to welcome you.â€
â€œah, yes, it is very well to see things in that business point of view,â€ murmured eustacia with a smothered fire of feeling. â€œbut why sho

uld you think there is anything between me and mr. wildeve? i have a spirit as well as you. i am indignant; and so would any woman be. it was a condescension in me to be clymâ€™s wife, and not a manoeuvre, let me remind you; and therefore i will not be treated as a schemer whom it becomes necessary to bear with because she has crept into the family.â€
â€œoh!â€ said mrs. yeobright, vainly endeavouring to control her anger. â€œi have never heard anything to show that my sonâ€™s lineage is not as good as the vyesâ€™â€”perhaps better. it is amusing to hear you talk of condescension.â€
â€œit was condescension, nevertheless,â€ said eustacia vehemently. â€œand if i had known then what i know now, that i should be living in this wild heath a month after my marriage, iâ€”i should have thought twice before agreeing.â€
â€œit would be better not to say that; it might not sound t

â€œand iâ€™ll do mine.â€
â€œa part of which will possibly be to set him against his mother. it is always so. but why should i not bear it as others have borne it before me!â€
â€œi understand you,â€ said eustacia, breathless with emotion. â€œyou think me capable of every bad thing. who can be worse than a wife who encourages a lover, and poisons her husbandâ€™s mind against his relative? yet that is now the character given to me. will you not come and drag him out of my hands?â€
mrs. yeobright gave back heat for heat.
â€œdonâ€™t rage at me, madam! it ill becomes your beauty, and i am not worth the injury you may do it on my account, i assure you. i am only a poor old woman who has lost a son.â€
â€œif you had treated me honourably you would have had him still.â€ eustacia said, while scalding tears trickled from her eyes. â€œyou have brought yourself to folly; you have caused a division which can never be healed!â€
â€œi have done nothing. this audacity from a young woman is more tha

the excited mother then withdrew, and eustacia, panting, stood looking into the pool.




2â€”he is set upon by adversities but he sings a song

the result of that unpropitious interview was that eustacia, instead of passing the afternoon with her grandfather, hastily returned home to clym, where she arrived three hours earlier than she had been expected.
she came indoors with her face flushed, and her eyes still showing traces of her recent excitement. yeobright looked up astonished; he had never seen her in any way approaching to that state before. she passed him by, and would have gone upstairs unnoticed, but clym was so concerned that he immediately followed her.
â€œwhat is the matter, eustacia?â€ he said. she was standing on the hearthrug in the bedroom, looking upon the floor, her hands clasped in front of her, her bonnet yet unremoved. for a moment she did not answer; and then she replied in a low voiceâ€”
â€œi have seen your mother; and i will

â€œi would rather not say. it may have been the fault of the circumstances, which were awkward at the very least. o clymâ€”i cannot help expressing itâ€”this is an unpleasant position that you have placed me in. but you must improve itâ€”yes, say you willâ€”for i hate it all now! yes, take me to paris, and go on with your old occupation, clym! i donâ€™t mind how humbly we live there at first, if it can only be paris, and not egdon heath.â€
â€œbut i have quite given up that idea,â€ said yeobright, with surprise. â€œsurely i never led you to expect such a thing?â€
â€œi own it. yet there are thoughts which cannot be kept out of mind, and that one was mine. must i not have a voice in the matter, now i am your wife and the sharer of your doom?â€
â€œwell, there are things which are placed beyond the pale of discussion; and i thought this was specially so, and by mutual agreement.â€
â€œclym, i am unhappy at what i hear,â€ she said in a low voice; and her eyes drooped, and she turned away.

she came to you, thomasin?â€
â€œyes.â€
â€œvery much indeed?â€
â€œyes.â€
clym leant his elbow upon the post of the garden gate, and covered his eyes with his hand.
â€œdonâ€™t trouble about it, clym. they may get to be friends.â€
he shook his head. â€œnot two people with inflammable natures like theirs. well, what must be will be.â€
â€œone thing is cheerful in itâ€”the guineas are not lost.â€
â€œi would rather have lost them twice over than have had this happen.â€
amid these jarring events yeobright felt one thing to be indispensableâ€”that he should speedily make some show of progress in his scholastic plans. with this view he read far into the small hours during many nights.
one morning, after a severer strain than usual, he awoke with a strange sensation in his eyes. the sun was shining directly upon the window-blind, and at his first glance thitherward a sharp pain obliged him to close his eyelids quickly. at every new attempt to look about him the same morbid sensibility to light was

ate which, though affording him sight enough for walking about, would not admit of their being strained upon any definite object without incurring the risk of reproducing ophthalmia in its acute form.
clym was very grave at the intelligence, but not despairing. a quiet firmness, and even cheerfulness, took possession of him. he was not to be blind; that was enough. to be doomed to behold the world through smoked glass for an indefinite period was bad enough, and fatal to any kind of advance; but yeobright was an absolute stoic in the face of mishaps which only affected his social standing; and, apart from eustacia, the humblest walk of life would satisfy him if it could be made to work in with some form of his culture scheme. to keep a cottage night-school was one such form; and his affliction did not master his spirit as it might otherwise have done.
he walked through the warm sun westward into those tracts of egdon with which he was best acquainted, being those lying nearer to his old home. he

 saw before him in one of the valleys the gleaming of whetted iron, and advancing, dimly perceived that the shine came from the tool of a man who was cutting furze. the worker recognized clym, and yeobright learnt from the voice that the speaker was humphrey.
humphrey expressed his sorrow at clymâ€™s condition, and added, â€œnow, if yours was low-class work like mine, you could go on with it just the same.â€
â€œyes, i could,â€ said yeobright musingly. â€œhow much do you get for cutting these faggots?â€
â€œhalf-a-crown a hundred, and in these long days i can live very well on the wages.â€
during the whole of yeobrightâ€™s walk home to alderworth he was lost in reflections which were not of an unpleasant kind. on his coming up to the house eustacia spoke to him from the open window, and he went across to her.
â€œdarling,â€ he said, â€œi am much happier. and if my mother were reconciled to me and to you i should, i think, be happy

â€œbut my grandfather offers to assist us, if we require assistance.â€
â€œwe donâ€™t require it. if i go furze-cutting we shall be fairly well off.â€
â€œin comparison with slaves, and the israelites in egypt, and such people!â€ a bitter tear rolled down eustaciaâ€™s face, which he did not see. there had been nonchalance in his tone, showing her that he felt no absolute grief at a consummation which to her was a positive horror.
the very next day yeobright went to humphreyâ€™s cottage, and borrowed of him leggings, gloves, a whetstone, and a hook, to use till he should be able to purchase some for himself. then he sallied forth with his new fellow-labourer and old acquaintance, and selecting a spot where the furze grew thickest he struck the first blow in his adopted calling. his sight, like the wings in rasselas, though useless to him for his grand purpose, sufficed for this strait, and he found that when a little practice should have hardened h

the monotony of his occupation soothed him, and was in itself a pleasure. a forced limitation of effort offered a justification of homely courses to an unambitious man, whose conscience would hardly have allowed him to remain in such obscurity while his powers were unimpeded. hence yeobright sometimes sang to himself, and when obliged to accompany humphrey in search of brambles for faggot-bonds he would amuse his companion with sketches of parisian life and character, and so while away the time.
on one of these warm afternoons eustacia walked out alone in the direction of yeobrightâ€™s place of work. he was busily chopping away at the furze, a long row of faggots which stretched downward from his position representing the labour of the day. he did not observe her approach, and she

â€œi have still some tenderness left for you.â€

â€œi cannot listen to this, clymâ€”it will end bitterly,â€ she said in a broken voice. â€œi will go home.â€




3â€”she goes out to battle against depression

a few days later, before the month of august has expired, eustacia and yeobright sat together at their early dinner.
eustaciaâ€™s manner had become of late almost apathetic. there was a forlorn look about her beautiful eyes which, whether she deserved it or not, would have excited pity in the breast of anyone who had known her during the full flush of her love for clym. the feelings of husband and wife varied, in some measure, inversely with their positions. clym, the afflicted man, was cheerful; and he even tried to comfort her, who had never felt a moment of physical suff

she was silent awhile. â€œhave you heard that he has chosen to work as a furze-cutter?â€ she said in a low, mournful voice.
â€œit has been mentioned to me,â€ answered wildeve hesitatingly. â€œbut i hardly believed it.â€
â€œit is true. what do you think of me as a furze-cutterâ€™s wife?â€
â€œi think the same as ever of you, eustacia. nothing of that sort can degrade youâ€”you ennoble the occupation of your husband.â€
â€œi wish i could feel it.â€
â€œis there any chance of mr. yeobright getting better?â€
â€œhe thinks so. i doubt it.â€
â€œi was quite surprised to hear that he had taken a cottage. i thought, in common with other people, that he would have taken you off to a home in paris immediately after you had married him. â€˜what a gay, bright future she has before her!â€™ i thought. he will, i suppose, return there with you, if his sight gets strong again?â€
observing that she did not reply he regarded her more closely. she was almost weeping. images of a future never to

gotten an item in our meetings at rainbarrowâ€”he is in company with your husband. which of them, seeing us together here, will believe that our meeting and dancing at the gipsy party was by chance?â€
â€œvery well,â€ she whispered gloomily. â€œleave me before they come up.â€
wildeve bade her a tender farewell, and plunged across the fern and furze, eustacia slowly walking on. in two or three minutes she met her husband and his companion.
â€œmy journey ends here for tonight, reddleman,â€ said yeobright as soon as he perceived her. â€œi turn back with this lady. good night.â€
â€œgood night, mr. yeobright,â€ said venn. â€œi hope to see you better soon.â€
the moonlight shone directly upon vennâ€™s face as he spoke, and revealed all its lines to eustacia. he was looking suspiciously at her. that vennâ€™s keen eye had discerned what yeobrightâ€™s feeble vision had notâ€”a man in the act of withdrawing from eustaciaâ€™s sideâ€”was within the limits of the probable.

4â€”rough coercion is employed

those words of thomasin, which seemed so little, but meant so much, remained in the ears of diggory venn: â€œhelp me to keep him home in the evenings.â€
on this occasion venn had arrived on egdon heath only to cross to the other sideâ€”he had no further connection with the interests of the yeobright family, and he had a business of his own to attend to. yet he suddenly began to feel himself drifting into the old track of manoeuvring on thomasinâ€™s account.
he sat in his van and considered. from thomasinâ€™s words and manner he had plainly gathered that wildeve neglected her. for whom could he neglect her if not for eustacia? yet it was scarcely credible that things had come to such a head as to indicate that eustacia systematically encouraged him. venn resolved to reconnoitre somewhat car

specially those akin to physical fear, this species of coup-de-jarnac from one he knew too well troubled the mind of wildeve. but his movements were unaltered thereby. a night or two later he again went along the vale to alderworth, taking the precaution of keeping out of any path. the sense that he was watched, that craft was employed to circumvent his errant tastes, added piquancy to a journey so entirely sentimental, so long as the danger was of no fearful sort. he imagined that venn and mrs. yeobright were in league, and felt that there was a certain legitimacy in combating such a coalition.
the heath tonight appeared to be totally deserted; and wildeve, after looking over eustaciaâ€™s garden gate for some little time, with a cigar in his mouth, was tempted by the fascination that emotional smuggling had for his nature to advance towards the window, which was not quite closed, the blind being only partly drawn down. he could see into the room, and eustacia was sitting there alone. wildeve co

table, hovered round it two or three times, and flew into the flame.
eustacia started up. this had been a well-known signal in old times when wildeve had used to come secretly wooing to mistover. she at once knew that wildeve was outside, but before she could consider what to do her husband came in from upstairs. eustaciaâ€™s face burnt crimson at the unexpected collision of incidents, and filled it with an animation that it too frequently lacked.
â€œyou have a very high colour, dearest,â€ said yeobright, when he came close enough to see it. â€œyour appearance would be no worse if it were always so.â€
â€œi am warm,â€ said eustacia. â€œi think i will go into the air for a few minutes.â€
â€œshall i go with you?â€
â€œo no. i am only going to the gate.â€
she arose, but before she had time to get out of the room a loud rapping began upon the front door.
â€œiâ€™ll goâ€”iâ€™ll go,â€ said eustacia in an unusually quick tone for her; and she glanced eagerly towards the window whence the moth had f

icipated that the tendency of his action would be to divert wildeveâ€™s movement rather than to stop it. the gambling with the guineas had not conduced to make him a welcome guest to clym; but to call upon his wifeâ€™s relative was natural, and he was determined to see eustacia. it was necessary to choose some less untoward hour than ten oâ€™clock at night. â€œsince it is unsafe to go in the evening,â€ he said, â€œiâ€™ll go by day.â€
meanwhile venn had left the heath and gone to call upon mrs. yeobright, with whom he had been on friendly terms since she had learnt what a providential countermove he had made towards the restitution of the family guineas. she wondered at the lateness of his call, but had no objection to see him.
he gave her a full account of clymâ€™s affliction, and of the state in which he was living; then, referring to thomasin, touched gently upon the apparent sadness of her days. â€œnow, maâ€™am, depend upon it,â€ he said, â€œyou couldnâ€™t do a better thing for either of â

â€œboth she and my son disobeyed me in marrying; therefore i have no interest in their households. their troubles are of their own making.â€ mrs. yeobright tried to speak severely; but the account of her sonâ€™s state had moved her more than she cared to show.
â€œyour visits would make wildeve walk straighter than he is inclined to do, and might prevent unhappiness down the heath.â€
â€œwhat do you mean?â€
â€œi saw something tonight out there which i didnâ€™t like at all. i wish your sonâ€™s house and mr. wildeveâ€™s were a hundred miles apart instead of four or five.â€

â€œhow?â€
â€œo, not by talkingâ€”by a plan of mine called the silent system.â€
â€œi hope youâ€™ll succeed.â€
â€œi shall if you help me by calling and making friends with your son. youâ€™ll have a chance then of using your eyes.â€
â€œwell, since it has come to this,â€ said mrs. yeobright sadly, â€œi will own to you, reddleman, that i thought of going. i should be much happier if we were reconciled. the marriage is unalterable, my life may be cut short, and i should wish to die in peace. he is my only son; and since sons are made of such stuff i am not sorry i have no other. as for thomasin, i never expected much from her; and she has not disappointed me. but i forgave her long ago; and i forgive him now. iâ€™ll go.â€

5â€”the journey across the heath

thursday, the thirty-first of august, was one of a series of days during which snug houses were stifling, and when cool draughts were treats; when cracks appeared in clayey gardens, and were called â€œearthquakesâ€ by apprehensive children; when loose spokes were discovered in the wheels of carts and carriages; and when stinging insects haunted the air, the earth, and every drop of water that was to be found.
in mrs. yeobrightâ€™s garden large-leaved plants of a tender kind flagged by ten oâ€™clock in the morning; rhubarb bent downward at eleven; and even stiff cabbages were limp by noon.
it was about eleven oâ€™clock on this day that mrs. yeobright started across the heath towards her sonâ€™s house, to do her best in getting reconciled with him and eustacia, in conformity with her words to the reddleman. she had hoped to be well advanced in her walk before the heat of the day was at its highest, but after setting ou

t she found that this was not to be done. the sun had branded the whole heath with its mark, even the purple heath-flowers having put on a brownness under the dry blazes of the few preceding days. every valley was filled with air like that of a kiln, and the clean quartz sand of the winter water-courses, which formed summer paths, had undergone a species of incineration since the drought had set in.
in cool, fresh weather mrs. yeobright would have found no inconvenience in walking to alderworth, but the present torrid attack made the journey a heavy undertaking for a woman past middle age; and at the end of the third mile she wished that she had hired fairway to drive her a portion at least of the distance. but from the point at which she had arrived it was as easy to reach clymâ€™s house as to get home again. so she went on, the air around her pulsating silently, and oppressing the earth with lassitude. she looked at the sky

. all the shallower ponds had decreased to a vaporous mud amid which the maggoty shapes of innumerable obscure creatures could be indistinctly seen, heaving and wallowing with enjoyment. being a woman not disinclined to philosophize she sometimes sat down under her umbrella to rest and to watch their happiness, for a certain hopefulness as to the result of her visit gave ease to her mind, and between important thoughts left it free to dwell on any infinitesimal matter which caught her eyes.
mrs. yeobright had never before been to her sonâ€™s house, and its exact position was unknown to her. she tried one ascending path and another, and found that they led her astray. retracing her steps, she came again to an open level, where she perceived at a distance a man at work. she went towards him and inquired the way.
the labourer pointed out the direction, and added, â€œdo you see that furze-cutter, maâ€™am, going up that footpath yond?â€
mrs. yeobright strained her eyes, and at last said that she did

 perceive him.
â€œwell, if you follow him you can make no mistake. heâ€™s going to the same place, maâ€™am.â€
she followed the figure indicated. he appeared of a russet hue, not more distinguishable from the scene around him than the green caterpillar from the leaf it feeds on. his progress when actually walking was more rapid than mrs. yeobrightâ€™s; but she was enabled to keep at an equable distance from him by his habit of stopping whenever he came to a brake of brambles, where he paused awhile. on coming in her turn to each of these spots she found half a dozen long limp brambles which he had cut from the bush during his halt and laid out straight beside the path. they were evidently intended for furze-faggot bonds which he meant to collect on his return.
the silent being who thus occupied himself seemed to be of no more account in

ion dress of the craft, and thinking the regulation thoughts, to judge by his motions. planning a dozen hasty schemes for at once preserving him and eustacia from this mode of life, she throbbingly followed the way, and saw him enter his own door.
at one side of clymâ€™s house was a knoll, and on the top of the knoll a clump of fir trees so highly thrust up into the sky that their foliage from a distance appeared as a black spot in the air above the crown of the hill. on reaching this place mrs. yeobright felt distressingly agitated, weary, and unwell. she ascended, and sat down under their shade to recover herself, and to consider how best to break the ground with eustacia, so as not to irritate a woman underneath whose apparent indolence lurked passions even stronger and more active than her own.
the trees beneath which she sat were singularly battered, rude, and wild, and for a few minutes mrs. yeobright dismissed thoughts of her own storm-broken and exhausted state to contemplate theirs. not

asons for that name. on the present heated afternoon, when no perceptible wind was blowing, the trees kept up a perpetual moan which one could hardly believe to be caused by the air.
here she sat for twenty minutes or more ere she could summon resolution to go down to the door, her courage being lowered to zero by her physical lassitude. to any other person than a mother it might have seemed a little humiliating that she, the elder of the two women, should be the first to make advances. but mrs. yeobright had well considered all that, and she only thought how best to make her visit appear to eustacia not abject but wise.
from her elevated position the exhausted woman could perceive the roof of the house below, and the garden and the whole enclosure of the little domicile. and now, at the moment of rising, she saw a second man approaching the gate. his manner was peculiar, hesitating, and not that of a person come on business or by invitation. he surveyed the house with interest, and then walked

round and scanned the outer boundary of the garden, as one might have done had it been the birthplace of shakespeare, the prison of mary stuart, or the chateau of hougomont. after passing round and again reaching the gate he went in. mrs. yeobright was vexed at this, having reckoned on finding her son and his wife by themselves; but a momentâ€™s thought showed her that the presence of an acquaintance would take off the awkwardness of her first appearance in the house, by confining the talk to general matters until she had begun to feel comfortable with them. she came down the hill to the gate, and looked into the hot garden.
there lay the cat asleep on the bare gravel of the path, as if beds, rugs, and carpets were unendurable. the leaves

nd in an ordinary manner, chatting a little while, and leaving again. every outward sign was to be conventional; but the one great fact would be there to satisfy himâ€”he would see her. he did not even desire clymâ€™s absence, since it was just possible that eustacia might resent any situation which could compromise her dignity as a wife, whatever the state of her heart towards him. women were often so.
he went accordingly; and it happened that the time of his arrival coincided with that of mrs. yeobrightâ€™s pause on the hill near the house. when he had looked round the premises in the manner she had noticed he went and knocked at the door. there was a few minutesâ€™ interval, and then the key turned in the lock, the door opened, and eustacia herself confronted him.
nobody could have imagined from her bearing now that here stood the woman who had joined with him in the impassioned dance of the week before, unless indeed he could have penetrated below the surface and gauged the real depth of tha

â€œwhy does he go out at all!â€ wildeve whispered.
â€œbecause he hates to be idle; though what he earns doesnâ€™t add much to our exchequer. however, he says that when people are living upon their capital they must keep down current expenses by turning a penny where they can.â€
â€œthe fates have not been kind to you, eustacia yeobright.â€
â€œi have nothing to thank them for.â€
â€œnor has heâ€”except for their one great gift to him.â€
â€œwhatâ€™s that?â€
wildeve looked her in the eyes.
eustacia blushed for the first time that day. â€œwell, i am a questionable gift,â€ she said quietly. â€œi thought you meant the gift of contentâ€”which he has, and i have not.â€
â€œi can understand content in such a caseâ€”though how the outward situation can attract him puzzles me.â€

â€œgod, how i envy him that sweet sleep!â€ said wildeve. â€œi have not slept like that since i was a boyâ€”years and years ago.â€
while they thus watched him a click at the gate was audible, and a knock came to the door. eustacia went to a window and looked out.
her countenance changed. first she became crimson, and then the red subsided till it even partially left her lips.
â€œshall i go away?â€ said wildeve, standing up.
â€œi hardly know.â€
â€œwho is it?â€
â€œmrs. yeobright. o, what she said to me that day! i cannot understand this visitâ€”what does she mean? and she suspects that past time of ours.â€
â€œi am in your hands. if you think she had better not see me here iâ€™ll go into the next room.â€
â€œwell, yesâ€”go.â€
wildeve at once withdrew; but before he had been half a minute in the adjoining apartment eustacia came after him.

mrs. yeobright knocked again more loudly.
â€œher knocking will, in all likelihood, awaken him,â€ continued eustacia, â€œand then he will let her in himself. ahâ€”listen.â€
they could hear clym moving in the other room, as if disturbed by the knocking, and he uttered the word â€œmother.â€
â€œyesâ€”he is awakeâ€”he will go to the door,â€ she said, with a breath of relief. â€œcome this way. i have a bad name with her, and you must not be seen. thus i am obliged to act by stealth, not because i do ill, but be

 and passed into the garden, where she watched him down the path, over the stile at the end, and into the ferns outside, which brushed his hips as he went along till he became lost in their thickets. when he had quite gone she slowly turned, and directed her attention to the interior of the house.
but it was possible that her presence might not be desired by clym and his mother at this moment of their first meeting, or that it would be superfluous. at all events, she was in no hurry to meet mrs. yeobright. she resolved to wait till clym came to look for her, and glided back into the garden. here she idly occupied herself for a few minutes, till finding no notice was taken of her she retraced her steps through the house to the front, where she listened for voices in the parlour. but hearing none she opened the door and went in. to her astonishment clym lay precisely as wildeve and herself had left him, his sleep apparently unbroken. he had been disturbed and made to dream and murmur by the knocki

ng, but he had not awakened. eustacia hastened to the door, and in spite of her reluctance to open it to a woman who had spoken of her so bitterly, she unfastened it and looked out. nobody was to be seen. there, by the scraper, lay clymâ€™s hook and the handful of faggot-bonds he had brought home; in front of her were the empty path, the garden gate standing slightly ajar; and, beyond, the great valley of purple heath thrilling silently in the sun. mrs. yeobright was gone.
clymâ€™s mother was at this time following a path which lay hidden from eustacia by a shoulder of the hill. her walk thither from the garden gate had been hasty and determined, as of a woman who was now no less anxious to escape from the scene than she had previously been to enter it. her eyes were fixed on the ground; within her two sights were gravenâ€”that of clymâ€™s hook and brambles at the door, and that of a womanâ€™s face at a window. her lips trembled, becoming unnaturally th

is too muchâ€”clym, how can he bear to do it! he is at home; and yet he lets her shut the door against me!â€
in her anxiety to get out of the direct view of the house she had diverged from the straightest path homeward, and while looking about to regain it she came upon a little boy gathering whortleberries in a hollow. the boy was johnny nunsuch, who had been eustaciaâ€™s stoker at the bonfire, and, with the tendency of a minute body to gravitate towards a greater, he began hovering round mrs. yeobright as soon as she appeared, and trotted on beside her without perceptible consciousness of his act.
mrs. yeobright spoke to him as one in a mesmeric sleep. â€œâ€˜tis a long way home, my child, and we shall not get there till evening.â€
â€œi shall,â€ said her small companion. â€œi am going to play marnels afore supper, and we go to supper at six oâ€™clock, because father comes home. does your father come home at six too?â€
â€œno, he never comes; nor my son either, nor anybody.â€
â€œwhat have ma

€œyes. but not so much as you be.â€
â€œhow do you know?â€
â€œyour face is white and wet, and your head is hanging-down-like.â€
â€œah, i am exhausted from inside.â€
â€œwhy do you, every time you take a step, go like this?â€ the child in speaking gave to his motion the jerk and limp of an invalid.
â€œbecause i have a burden which is more than i can bear.â€
the little boy remained silently pondering, and they tottered on side by side until more than a quarter of an hour had elapsed, when mrs. yeobright, whose weakness plainly increased, said to him, â€œi must sit down here to rest.â€
when she had seated herself he looked long in her face and said, â€œhow funny you draw your breathâ€”like a lamb when you drive him till heâ€™s nearly done for. do you always draw your breath like that?â€
â€œnot always.â€ her voice was now so low as to be scarcely above a whisper.
â€œyou will go to sleep there, i suppose, wonâ€™t you? you have shut your eyes already.â€
â€œno. i shall not sleep much tillâ€”ano

€œthen, take this, and go as fast as you can, and dip me up the clearest you can find. i am very faint.â€
she drew from the small willow reticule that she carried in her hand an old-fashioned china teacup without a handle; it was one of half a dozen of the same sort lying in the reticule, which she had preserved ever since her childhood, and had brought with her today as a small present for clym and eustacia.
the boy started on his errand, and soon came back with the water, such as it was. mrs. yeobright attempted to drink, but it was so warm as to give her nausea, and she threw it away. afterwards she still remained sitting, with her eyes closed.
the boy waited, played near her, caught several of the little brown butterflies which abounded, and then said as he waited again, â€œi like going on better than biding still. will you soon start again?â€
â€œi donâ€™t know.â€
â€œi wish i might go on by myself,â€ he resumed, fearing, apparently, that he was to be pressed into some unpleasant service.

 â€œdo you want me any more, please?â€
mrs. yeobright made no reply.
â€œwhat shall i tell mother?â€ the boy continued.
â€œtell her you have seen a broken-hearted woman cast off by her son.â€
before quite leaving her he threw upon her face a wistful glance, as if he had misgivings on the generosity of forsaking her thus. he gazed into her face in a vague, wondering manner, like that of one examining some strange old manuscript the key to whose characters is undiscoverable. he was not so young as to be absolutely without a sense that sympathy was

demanded, he was not old enough to be free from the terror felt in childhood at beholding misery in adult quarters hither-to deemed impregnable; and whether she were in a position to cause trouble or to suffer from it, whether she and her affliction were something to pity or something to fear, it was beyond him to decide. he lowered his eyes and went on without another word. before he had gone half a mile he had forgotten all about her, except that she was a woman who had sat down to rest.
mrs. yeobrightâ€™s exertions, physical and emotional, had well-nigh prostrated her; but she continued to creep along in short stages with long breaks between. the sun had now got far to the west of south and stood directly in her face, like some merciless incendiary, brand in hand, waiting to consume her. with the departure of the boy all visible animation disappeared from the landscape, though the intermittent husky notes of the male grasshoppers from every tuft of furze were enough to show that amid the pro

he looked to where the sound came from; but nothing appeared there save the verge of the hillock stretching against the sky in an unbroken line. he moved a few steps in that direction, and now he perceived a recumbent figure almost close to his feet.
among the different possibilities as to the personâ€™s individuality there did not for a moment occur to yeobright that it might be one of his own family. sometimes furze-cutters had been known to sleep out of doors at these times, to save a long journey homeward and back again; but clym remembered the moan and looked closer, and saw that the form was feminine; and a distress came over him like cold air from a cave. but he was not absolutely certain that the woman was his mother till he stooped and beheld her face, pallid, and with closed eyes.

â€œo, what is it! mother, are you very illâ€”you are not dying?â€ he cried, pressing his lips to her face. â€œi am your clym. how did you come here? what does it all mean?â€
at that moment the chasm in their lives which his love for eustacia had caused was not remembered by yeobright, and to him the present joined continuously with that friendly past that had been their experience before the division.
she moved her lips, appeared to know him, but could not speak; and then clym strove to consider how best to move her, as it would be necessary to get her away from the spot before the dews were intense. he was able-bodied, and his mother was thin. he clasped his arms round her, lifted her a little, and said, â€œdoes that hurt you?â€
she shook her head, and he lifted her up; t

the live adder regarded the assembled group with a sinister look in its small black eye, and the beautiful brown and jet pattern on its back seemed to intensify with indignation. mrs. yeobright saw the creature, and the creature saw herâ€”she quivered throughout, and averted her eyes.
â€œlook at that,â€ murmured christian cantle. â€œneighbours, how do we know but that something of the old serpent in godâ€™s garden, that gied the apple to the young woman with no clothes, lives on in adders and snakes still? look at his eyeâ€”for all the world like a villainous sort of black currant. â€˜tis to be hoped he canâ€™t ill-wish us! thereâ€™s folks in heath whoâ€™ve been overlooked already. i

â€œeven such an ignorant fellow as i should know better than do that,â€ said sam.
â€œwell, thereâ€™s calamities where we least expect it, whether or no. neighbours, if mrs. yeobright were to die, dâ€™ye think we should be took up and tried for the manslaughter of a woman?â€
â€œno, they couldnâ€™t bring it in as that,â€ said sam, â€œunless they could prove we had been poachers at some time of our lives. but sheâ€™ll fetch round.â€

â€œhow did you come here?â€ she said in her clear low tone. â€œi thought you were at home.â€
â€œi went on to the village after leaving your garden; and now i have come back againâ€”thatâ€™s all. which way are you walking, may i ask?â€
she waved her hand in the direction of blooms-end. â€œi am going to meet my husband. i think i may possibly have got into trouble whilst you were with me today.â€
â€œhow could that be?â€
â€œby not letting in mrs. yeobright.â€
â€œi hope that visit of mine did you no harm.â€
â€œnone. it was not your fault,â€ she said quietly.
by this time she had risen; and they involuntarily sauntered on together, without speaking, for two or three minutes; when eustacia broke silence by saying, â€œi assume i must congratulate you.â€
â€œon what? o yes; on my eleven thousand pounds, you mean. well, since i didnâ€™t get something else, i must be content with getting that.â€

â€œsince you have come so far,â€ said eustacia, â€œwill you see me safely past that hut? i thought i should have met clym somewhere about here, but as he doesnâ€™t appear i will hasten on and get to blooms-end before he leaves.â€
they advanced to the turf-shed, and when they got near it the firelight and the lantern inside showed distinctly enough the form of a woman reclining on a bed of fern, a group of heath men and women standing around her. eustacia did not recognize mrs. yeobright in the reclining figure, nor clym as one of the standers-by till she came close. then she quickly pressed her hand up on wildeveâ€™s arm and signified to him to come back from the open side of the shed into the shadow.
â€œit is my husband and his mother,â€ she whispered in an agitated voice. â€œwhat can it mean? will you step forward and tell me?â€
wildeve left her side and went to the back wall of the hut. presently eustacia perceived that he was beckoning to her, and she advanced and joined

â€œcome here, come here!â€ was then rapidly said in anxious female tones, and clym and the doctor could be heard rushing forward from the back part of the shed to where mrs. yeobright lay.
â€œoh, what is it?â€ whispered eustacia.
â€œâ€˜twas thomasin who spoke,â€ said wildeve. â€œthen they have fetched her. i wonder if i had better go inâ€”yet it might do harm.â€
for a long time there was utter silence among the group within; and it was broken at last by clym saying, in an agonized voice, â€œo doctor, what does it mean?â€
the doctor did not reply at once; ultimately he said, â€œshe is sinking fast. her heart was previously affected, and physical exhaustion has dealt the f

then there was a weeping of women, then waiting, then hushed exclamations, then a strange gasping sound, then a painful stillness.
â€œit is all over,â€ said the doctor.
further back in the hut the cotters whispered, â€œmrs. yeobright is dead.â€
almost at the same moment the two watchers observed the form of a small old-fashioned child entering at the open side of the shed. susan nunsuch, whose boy it was, went forward to the opening and silently beckoned to him to go back.
â€œiâ€™ve got something to tell â€˜ee, mother,â€ he cried in a shrill tone. â€œthat woman asleep there walked along with me today; and she said i was to say that i had seed her, and she was a broken-hearted woman and cast off by her son, and then i came

they parted company; and when eustacia had reached the next hill she looked back. a melancholy procession was wending its way by the light of the lantern from the hut towards blooms-end. wildeve was nowhere to be seen.




book five â€” the discovery





1â€”â€œwherefore is light given to him that is in miseryâ€

one evening, about three weeks after the funeral of mrs. yeobright, when the silver face of the moon sent a bundle of beams directly upon the floor of clymâ€™s house at alderworth, a woman came forth from within. she reclined over the garden gate as if to refresh herself awhile. the pale lunar touches which make beauties of hags lent divinity to this face, already beautiful.
she had not long been there when a man came up the road and with some hesitation said to her, â€œhow is he tonight, maâ€™am, if you please?â€

there escaped from eustacia one of those shivering sighs which used to shake her like a pestilent blast. she had not yet told.
but yeobright was too deeply absorbed in the ramblings incidental to his remorseful state to notice her. during his illness he had been continually talking thus. despair had been added to his original grief by the unfortunate disclosure of the boy who had received the last words of mrs. yeobrightâ€”words too bitterly uttered in an hour of misapprehension. then his distress had overwhelmed him, and he longed for death as a field labourer longs for the shade. it was the pitiful sight of a man standing in the v

eustacia was always anxious to avoid the sight of her husband in such a state as this, which had become as dreadful to her as the trial scene was to judas iscariot. it brought before her eyes the spectre of a worn-out woman knocking at a door which she would not open; and she shrank from contemplating it. yet it was better for yeobright himself when he spoke openly of his sharp regret, for in silence he endured infinitely more, and would sometimes remain so long in a tense, brooding mood, consuming himself by the gnawing of his thought, that it was imperatively necessary to make him talk aloud, that his grief might in some degree expend itself in the effort.
eustacia had not been long indoors after her look at the moonlight when a soft footstep came up to the house, and thomasin was announced by the woman downstairs.

â€œthere is one man, please, sir, but i hope you wonâ€™t mention my name to him, as i have seen him in strange places, particular in dreams. one night last summer he glared at me like famine and sword, and it made me feel so low that i didnâ€™t comb out my few hairs for two days. he was standing, as it might be, mister yeobright, in the middle of the path to mistover, and your mother came up, looking as paleâ€”â€

christian then departed. the morrow came, but no venn. in the evening christian arrived, looking very weary. he had been searching all day, and had heard nothing of the reddleman.
â€œinquire as much as you can tomorrow without neglecting your work,â€ said yeobright. â€œdonâ€™t come again till you have found him.â€

yeobright opened it, and venn was standing before him.

yeobright looked upon the ground. â€œthen you have not seen christian or any of the egdon folks?â€ he said.

ble things.
it was about daybreak when he had reached this decision, and he at once arose. he locked up the house and went out into the green patch which merged in heather further on. in front of the white garden-palings the path branched into three like a broad arrow. the road to the right led to the quiet woman and its neighbourhood; the middle track led to mistover knap; the left-hand track led over the hill to another part of mistover, where the child lived. on inclining into the latter path yeobright felt a creeping chilliness, familiar enough to most people, and probably caused by the unsunned morning air. in after days he thought of it as a thing of singular significance.
when yeobright reached the cottage of susan nunsuch, the mother of the boy he sought, he found that the inmates were not yet astir. but in upland hamlets the transition from a-bed to abroad is surprisingly swift and easy. there no dense partition of yawns and toilets divides humanity by night from humanity by day. yeobri

nce as a witch. it was one of those sentiments which lurk like moles underneath the visible surface of manners, and may have been kept alive by eustaciaâ€™s entreaty to the captain, at the time that he had intended to prosecute susan for the pricking in church, to let the matter drop; which he accordingly had done.
yeobright overcame his repugnance, for susan had at least borne his mother no ill-will. he asked kindly for the boy; but her manner did not improve.
â€œi wish to see him,â€ continued yeobright, with some hesitation, â€œto ask him if he remembers anything more of his walk with my mother than what he has previously told.â€
she regarded him in a peculiar and criticizing manner. to anybody but a half-blind man it would have said, â€œyou want another of the knocks which have already laid you so low.â€
she called the boy downstairs, asked clym to sit down on a stool, and continued, â€œnow, johnny, tell mr. yeobright anything you can call to mind.â€

â€œno,â€ said the boy.
â€œand what she said to you?â€
the boy repeated the exact words he had used on entering the hut. yeobright rested his elbow on the table and shaded his face with his hand; and the mother looked as if she wondered how a man could want more of what had stung him so deeply.
â€œshe was going to alderworth when you first met her?â€
â€œno; she was coming away.â€
â€œthat canâ€™t be.â€
â€œyes; she walked along with me. i was coming away, too.â€

clym started up, and susan smiled in an expectant way which did not embellish her face; it seemed to mean, â€œsomething sinister is coming!â€
â€œwhat did she do at my house?â€
â€œshe went and sat under the trees at the devilâ€™s bellows.â€
â€œgood god! this is all news to me!â€
â€œyou never told me this before?â€ said susan.
â€œno, mother; because i didnâ€™t like to tell â€˜ee i had been so far. i was picking blackhearts, and went further than i meant.â€

â€œo!â€ murmured clym, in a low tone, and bowed his head. â€œletâ€™s have more,â€ he said.
â€œshe couldnâ€™t talk much, and she couldnâ€™t walk; and her face was, o so queer!â€
â€œhow was her face?â€
â€œlike yours is now.â€
the woman looked at yeobright, and beheld him colourless, in a cold sweat. â€œisnâ€™t there meaning in it?â€ she said stealthily. â€œwhat do you think of her now?â€
â€œsilence!â€ said clym fiercely. and, turning to the boy, â€œand then you left her to die?â€
â€œno,â€ said the woman, quickly and angrily. â€œhe did not leave her to die! she sent him away. whoever says he forsook her says whatâ€™s not true.â€

with these words yeobright went forth from the little dwelling. the pupils of his eyes, fixed steadfastly on blankness, were vaguely lit with an icy shine; his mouth had passed into the phase more or less imaginatively rendered in studies of oedipus. the strangest deeds were possible to his mood. but they were not possible to his situation. instead of there being before him the pale face of eustacia, and a masculine shape unknown, there was only the imperturbable countenance of the heath, which, having defied the catacly

a consciousness of a vast impassivity in all which lay around him took possession even of yeobright in his wild walk towards alderworth. he had once before felt in his own person this overpowering of the fervid by the inanimate; but then it had tended to enervate a passion far sweeter than that which at present pervaded him. it was once when he stood parting from eustacia in the moist still levels beyond the hills.

the noise of his arrival must have aroused her, for when he opened the door she was standing before the looking glass in her nightdress, the ends of her hair gathered into one hand, with which she was coiling the whole mass round her head, previous to beginning toilette operations. she was not a woman given to speaking first at a meeting, and she allowed clym to walk across in silence, without turning her head. he came behind her, and she saw his

â€œyou know what is the matter,â€ he said huskily. â€œi see it in your face.â€
her hand relinquished the rope of hair and dropped to her side, and the pile of tresses, no longer supported, fell from the crown of her head about her shoulders and over the white nightgown. she made no reply.
â€œspeak to me,â€ said yeobright peremptorily.
the blanching process did not cease in her, and her lips now became as white as her face. she turned to him and said, â€œyes, clym, iâ€™ll speak to you. why do you return so early? can i do anything for you?â€
â€œyes, you can listen to me. it seems that my wife is not very well?â€
â€œwhy?â€
â€œyour face, my dear; your face. or perhaps it is the pale morning light which takes your colour away? now i am going to reveal a secret to you. ha-ha!â€
â€œo, that is ghastly!â€
â€œwhat?

a shudder overcame her and shook the light fabric of her nightdress throughout. â€œi do not remember dates so exactly,â€ she said. â€œi cannot recollect that anybody was with me besides yourself.â€
â€œthe day i mean,â€ said yeobright, his voice growing louder and harsher, â€œwas the day you shut the door against my mother and killed her. o, it is too muchâ€”too bad!â€ he leant over the footpiece of the bedstead for a few moments, with his back towards her; then rising againâ€”â€œtell me, tell me! tell meâ€”do you hear?â€ he cried, rushing up to her and seizing her by the loose folds of her sleeve.
the superstratum of timidity which often overlies those who are daring and defiant at heart had been passed through, and the m

â€œstay!â€ said eustacia, stepping before him with more excitement than she had hitherto shown.
â€œcome, come! stand away! i must see them.â€
she looked at the letters as they lay, checked her feeling and moved indifferently aside; when he gathered them up, and examined them.
by no stretch of meaning could any but a harmless construction be placed upon a single one of the letters themselves. the solitary exception was an empty envelope directed to her, and the handwriting was wildeveâ€™s. yeobright held it up. eustacia was doggedly silent.
â€œcan you read, madam? look at this envelope. doubtless we shall find more soon, and what was inside them. i shall no doubt be gratified by learning in good time what a well-finished and full-blown adept in a certain trade my lady is.â€
â€œdo you say it to meâ€”do you?â€ she gasped.
he searched further, but found nothing more. â€œwhat was in this letter?â€ he said.
â€œask the writer. am i your hound that you should talk to me in this way?â€

â€œyou need not goâ€”i will go. you can stay here.â€
â€œno, i will dress, and then i will go.â€
â€œwhere?â€
â€œwhere i came from, or elsewhere.â€
she hastily dressed herself, yeobright moodily walking up and down the room the whole of the time. at last all her things were on. her little hands quivered so violently as she held them to her chin to fasten her bonnet that she could not tie the strings, and after a few moments she relinquished the attempt. seeing this he moved forward and said, â€œlet me tie them.â€
she assented in silence, and lifted her chin. for once at least in her life she was totally oblivious of the charm of her attitude. but he was not, and he turned his

â€œi do.â€
â€œvery wellâ€”let it be. and when you will confess to the man i may pity you.â€
she flung her shawl about her and went downstairs, leaving him standing in the room.
eustacia had not long been gone when there came a knock at the door of the bedroom; and yeobright said, â€œwell?â€
it was the servant; and she replied, â€œsomebody from mrs. wildeveâ€™s have called to tell â€˜ee that the misâ€™ess and the baby are getting on wonderful well, and the babyâ€™s name is to be eustacia clementine.â€ and the girl retired.
â€œwhat a mockery!â€ said clym. â€œthis unhappy marriage of mine to be perpetuated in that childâ€™s name!â€

a week passed, eustacia never going out of the house. then she walked into the enclosed plot and looked through her grandfatherâ€™s spyglass, as she had been in the habit of doing before her marriage. one day she saw, at a place where the highroad crossed the distant valley, a heavily laden wagon passing along. it was piled with household furniture. she looked again and again, and recognized it to be her own. in the evening her grandfather came indoors with a rumour that yeobright had removed that day from alderworth to the old house at blooms-end.
on another occasion when reconnoitring thus she beheld two female figures walking in the vale. the day was fine and clear; and the persons not being more than half a mile off she could see their every detail with the telescope. the woman walking in front carried a white bundle in her arms, from one end of which hung a long appendage of drapery; and when the walkers turned, so that the sun fell more directly upon them, eustacia

eustacia, who had been sitting listlessly in the parlour, started up at the intelligence and flung open the shutters. facing her on the bank blazed the fire, which at once sent a ruddy glare into the room where she was, and overpowered the candles.
â€œwell done, charley!â€ said captain vye from the chimney-corner. â€œbut i hope it is not my wood that heâ€™s burning.... ah, it was this time last year that i met with that man venn, bringi

ver she retired early, and sat in her bedroom waiting for the time to go by. the night being dark and threatening, captain vye had not strolled out to gossip in any cottage or to call at the inn, as was sometimes his custom on these long autumn nights; and he sat sipping grog alone downstairs. about ten oâ€™clock there was a knock at the door. when the servant opened it the rays of the candle fell upon the form of fairway.
â€œi was a-forced to go to lower mistover tonight,â€ he said, â€œand mr. yeobright asked me to leave this here on my way; but, faith, i put it in the lining of my hat, and thought no more about it till i got back and was hasping my gate before going to bed. so i have run back with it at once.â€
he handed in a letter and went his way. the girl brought it to the captain, who found that it was directed to eustacia. he turned it over and over, and fancied that the writing was her husbandâ€™s, though he could not be sure. however, he decided to let her have it at once if possible

susan held the object at armâ€™s length and contemplated it with a satisfaction in which there was no smile. to anybody acquainted with the inhabitants of egdon heath the image would have suggested eustacia yeobright.
from her workbasket in the window-seat the woman took a paper of pins, of the old long and yellow sort, whose heads were disposed to come off at their first usage. these she began to thrust into the image in all directions, with apparently excruciating energy. probably as many as fifty were thus inserted, some into the head of the wax model, some into the shoulders, some into the trunk, some upwards through the soles of the feet, till the figure was completely permeated with pins.

8â€”rain, darkness, and anxious wanderers

while the effigy of eustacia was melting to nothing, and the fair woman herself was standing on rainbarrow, her soul in an abyss of desolation seldom plumbed by one so young, yeobright sat lonely at blooms-end. he had fulfilled his word to thomasin by sending off fairway with the letter to his wife, and now waited with increased impatience for some sound or signal of her return. were eustacia still at mistover the very least he expected was that she would send him back a reply tonight by the same hand; though, to leave all to her inclination, he had cautioned fairway not to ask for an answer. if one were handed to him he was to bring it immediately; if not, he was to go strai

â€œno, noâ€”donâ€™t stay for that. iâ€™ll make up the fire. will you go at onceâ€”please will you?â€
yeobright ran upstairs to finish dressing himself. while he was gone another rapping came to the door. this time there was no delusion that it might be eustaciaâ€™sâ€”the footsteps just preceding it had been heavy and slow. yeobright thinking it might possibly be fairway with a note in answer, descended again and opened the door.
â€œcaptain vye?â€ he said to a dripping figure.

â€œbut you ought to knowâ€”you are her husband.â€

â€œare you going with me?â€ said yeobright, paying no attention to the captainâ€™s latter remark. â€œif so i can tell you what we quarrelled about as we walk along.â€
â€œwhere to?â€
â€œto wildeveâ€™sâ€”that was her destination, depend upon it.â€
thomasin here broke in, still weeping: â€œhe said he was only going on a sudden short journey; but if so why did he want so much money? o, clym, what do you think will happen? i am afraid that you, my poor baby, will soon have no father left to you!â€

at this moment a footstep approached; but the light of the lamps being in a different direction the comer was not visible. the step paused, then came on again.
â€œeustacia?â€ said wildeve.
the person came forward, and the light fell upon the form of clym, glistening with wet, whom wildeve immediately recognized; but wildeve, who stood behind the lamp, was not at once recognized by yeobright.
he stopped as if in doubt whether this waiting vehicle could have anything to do with the flight of his wife or not. the sight of yeobright at once banished wildeveâ€™s sober feelings, who saw him again as the deadly rival from whom eustacia was to be kept at all hazards. hence wildeve did not speak, in the hope that clym would pass by without particular inquiry.
while they both hung thus in hesitation a dull sound became audible above the storm and wind. its origin was unmistakableâ€”it was t

â€œwhy should it be she?â€ said wildeve, in his alarm forgetting that he had hitherto screened himself.
â€œah!â€”thatâ€™s you, you traitor, is it?â€ cried yeobright. â€œwhy should it be she? because last week she would have put an end to her life if she had been able. she ought to have been watched! take one of the lamps and come with me.â€
yeobright seized the one on his side and hastened on; wildeve did not wait to unfasten the other, but followed at once along the meadow track to the weir, a little in the rear of clym.
shadwater weir had at its foot a large circular pool, fifty feet in diameter, into which the water flowed through ten huge hatches, rai

hes, the framework of which was shaken to its foundations by the velocity of the current. nothing but the froth of the waves could be discerned in the pool below. he got upon the plank bridge over the race, and holding to the rail, that the wind might not blow him off, crossed to the other side of the river. there he leant over the wall and lowered the lamp, only to behold the vortex formed at the curl of the returning current.
wildeve meanwhile had arrived on the former side, and the light from yeobrightâ€™s lamp shed a flecked and agitated radiance across the weir pool, revealing to the ex-engineer the tumbling courses of the currents from the hatches above. across this gashed and puckered mirror a dark body was slowly borne by one of the backward currents.
â€œo, my darling!â€ exclaimed wildeve in an agonized voice; and, without showing sufficient presence of mind even to throw off his greatcoat, he leaped into the boiling caldron.
yeobright could now also discern the floating body, though bu

ason that the legs of the unfortunate stranger were tightly embraced by the arms of another man, who had hitherto been entirely beneath the surface.
at this moment his heart bounded to hear footsteps running towards him, and two men, roused by thomasin, appeared at the brink above. they ran to where venn was, and helped him in lifting out the apparently drowned persons, separating them, and laying them out upon the grass. venn turned the light upon their faces. the one who had been uppermost was yeobright; he who had been completely submerged was wildeve.
â€œnow we must search the hole again,â€ said venn. â€œa woman is in there somewhere. get a pole.â€
one of the men went to the footbridge and tore off the handrail. the reddleman and the two others then entered the water together from below as before, and with their united force probed the pool forwards to where it sloped down to its central depth. venn was not mistaken in supposing that any person who had sunk for the last time would be washe

venn soon felt himself relieved from further attendance, and went to the door, scarcely able yet to realize the strange catastrophe that had befallen the family in which he took so great an interest. thomasin surely would be broken down by the sudden and overwhelming nature of this event. no firm and sensible mrs. yeobright lived now to support the gentle girl through the ordeal; and, whatever an unimpassioned spectator might think of her loss of such a husband as wildeve, there could be no doubt that for the moment she was distracted and horrified by the blow. as for himself, not being privileged to go to her and comfort her, he saw no reason for waiting longer in a house where he remained only as a stranger.

p. but it was more than he could do to rest here while excited by a vivid imagination of the turmoil they were in at the house he had quitted, and, blaming himself for coming away, he dressed in another suit, locked up the door, and again hastened across to the inn. rain was still falling heavily when he entered the kitchen. a bright fire was shining from the hearth, and two women were bustling about, one of whom was olly dowden.
â€œwell, how is it going on now?â€ said venn in a whisper.
â€œmr. yeobright is better; but mrs. yeobright and mr. wildeve are dead and cold. the doctor says they were quite gone before they were out of the water.â€
â€œah! i thought as much when i hauled â€˜em up. and mrs. wildeve?â€
â€œshe is as well as can be expected. the doctor had her put between blankets, for she was almost as wet as they that had been in the river, poor young thing. you donâ€™t seem very dry, reddleman.â€

venn drew near to the fireplace, and looked into the flames in an absent mood. the steam came from his leggings and ascended the chimney with the smoke, while he thought of those who were upstairs. two were corpses, one had barely escaped the jaws of death, another was sick and a widow. the last occasion on which he had lingered by that fireplace was when the raffle was in progress; when wildeve was alive and well; thomasin active and smiling in the next room; yeobright and eustacia just made husband and wife, and mrs. yeobright living at blooms-end. it had seemed at that time that the then position of affairs was good for at least twenty years to come. yet, of all the circle, he himself was the only one whose situation had not materially changed.
while he ruminated a footstep descended the stairs. it was the nurse, who brought in her hand a rolled mass of wet paper. the woman was so engrossed with her occupation that she hardly saw venn. she took from a cupbo

â€œi dare say you may see her,â€ said diggory gravely. â€œbut hadnâ€™t you better run and tell captain vye?â€
â€œyes, yes. only i do hope i shall see her just once again.â€
â€œyou shall,â€ said a low voice behind; and starting round they beheld by the dim light, a thin, pallid, almost spectral form, wrapped in a blanket, and looking like lazarus coming from the tomb.
it was yeobright. neither venn nor charley spoke, and clym continued, â€œyou shall see her. there will be time enough to tell the captain when it gets daylight. you would like to see her tooâ€”would you not, diggory? she looks very beautiful now.â€
venn assented by rising to his feet, and with charley he followed clym to the foot of the staircase, where he took off his boots; charley did the same. they followed yeobright upstairs to the landing, where there was a candle burning, which yeobright took in his han

venn moved as if he would retire to the kitchen, when thomasin said with pleasant pertness as she went on with some sewing, â€œof course you must sit down here. and where does your fifty-cow dairy lie, mr. venn?â€
â€œat sticklefordâ€”about two miles to the right of alderworth, maâ€™am, where the meads begin. i have thought that if mr. yeobright would like to pay me a visit sometimes he shouldnâ€™t stay away for want of asking. iâ€™ll not bide to tea this afternoon, thankâ€™ee, for iâ€™ve got something on hand that must be settled. â€˜tis maypole-day tomorrow, and the shadwater folk have clubbed with a few of your neighbours here to have a pole just outside your palings in the heath, as it is a nice green place.â€ venn waved his elbow towards the patch in front of the house. â€œi have been talking to fairway about it,â€ he continued,

 â€œand i said to him that before we put up the pole it would be as well to ask mrs. wildeve.â€

â€œbut you might not like to see a lot of folk going crazy round a stick, under your very nose?â€
â€œi shall have no objection at all.â€
venn soon after went away, and in the evening yeobright strolled as far as fairwayâ€™s cottage. it was a lovely may sunset, and the birch trees which grew on this margin of the vast egdon wilderness had put on their new leaves, delicate as butterfliesâ€™ wings, and diaphanous as amber. beside fairwayâ€™s dwelling was an open space recessed from the road, and here were now collected all the young people from within a radius of a couple of miles. the pole lay with one end supported on a trestle, and women were engaged in wreathing it from the top down

when afternoon came people began to gather on the green, and yeobright was interested enough to look out upon them from the open window of his room. soon after this thomasin walked out from the door immediately below and turned her eyes up to her cousinâ€™s face. she was dressed more gaily than yeobright had ever seen her dressed since the time of wildeveâ€™s death, eighteen months before; since the day of her marriage even she had not exhibited herself to such advantage.
â€œhow pretty you look today, thomasin!â€ he said. â€œis it because of the maypole?â€

he recalled her conduct towards him throughout the last few weeks, when they had often been working together in the garden, just as they had formerly done when they were boy and girl under his motherâ€™s eye. what if her interest in him were not so entirely that of a relative as it had formerly been? to yeobright any possibility of this sort was a serious matter; and he almost felt troubled at the thought of it. every pulse of loverlike feeling which had not been stilled during eustaciaâ€™s lifetime had gone into the grave with her. his passion for her had occurred too far on in his manhood to leave fuel enough on hand for another fire of that sort, as may happen with more boyish loves. even supposing him capable of loving again, that love would be a plant of slow and laboured growth, and in the end onl

this conversation had passed in a hollow of the heath near the old roman road, a place much frequented by thomasin. and it might have been observed that she did not in future walk that way less often from having met venn there now. whether or not venn abstained from riding thither because he had met thomasin in the same place might easily have been guessed from her proceedings about two months later in the same year.




3â€”the serious discourse of clym with his cousin

throughout this period yeobright had more or less pondered on his duty to his cousin thomasin. he could not help feeling that it would be a pitiful waste of sweet material if the tender-natured thing should be doomed from this early stage of her life onwards to dribble away her winsome qualities on lonely gorse and fern. but he felt this as an economist merely, and not as a lover. his passion for eustacia had been a sort of conserve of his whole life, and he had nothing more of that supreme quality left to bestow. so far the o

as not to entertain any idea of marriage with thomasin, even to oblige her.
but this was not all. years ago there had been in his motherâ€™s mind a great fancy about thomasin and himself. it had not positively amounted to a desire, but it had always been a favourite dream. that they should be man and wife in good time, if the happiness of neither were endangered thereby, was the fancy in question. so that what course save one was there now left for any son who reverenced his motherâ€™s memory as yeobright did? it is an unfortunate fact that any particular whim of parents, which might have been dispersed by half an hourâ€™s conversation during their lives, becomes sublimated by their deaths into a fiat the most absolute, with such results to conscientious children as those parents, had they lived, would have been the first to decry.
had only yeobrightâ€™s own future been involved he would have proposed to thomasin with a ready heart. he had nothing to lose by carrying out a dead motherâ€™s hope.

it is to be supposed that thomasin was convinced; for a few days after this, when clym strayed into a part of the heath that he had not lately visited, humphrey, who was at work there, said to him, â€œi am glad to see that mrs. wildeve and venn have made it up again, seemingly.â€
â€œhave they?â€ said clym abstractedly.
â€œyes; and he do contrive to stumble upon her whenever she walks out on fine days with the chiel. but, mr. yeobright, i canâ€™t help feeling that your cousin ought to have married you. â€˜tis a pity to make two chimleycorners where there need be only one. you could get her away from him now, â€˜tis my belief, if you were only to set about it.â€
â€œhow can i have the conscience to marry after having driven two women to their deaths? donâ€™t think such a thing, humphrey. after my experience i should consider it too much of a burlesque to go to church and take a wife. in the words of job, â€˜i have made a coven

â€œno, mr. clym, donâ€™t fancy that about driving two women to their deaths. you shouldnâ€™t say it.â€
â€œwell, weâ€™ll leave that out,â€ said yeobright. â€œbut anyhow god has set a mark upon me which wouldnâ€™t look well in a love-making scene. i have two ideas in my head, and no others. i am going to keep a night-school; and i am going to turn preacher. what have you got to say to that, humphrey?â€
â€œiâ€™ll come and hear â€˜ee with all my heart.â€
â€œthanks. â€˜tis all i wish.â€

anybody who had passed through blooms-end about eleven oâ€™clock on the morning fixed for the wedding would have found that, while yeobrightâ€™s house was comparatively quiet, sounds denoting great activity came from the dwelling of his nearest neighbour, timothy fairway. it was chiefly a noise of feet, briskly crunching hither and thither over the sanded floor within. one man only was visible outside, and he seemed to be later at an appointment than he had intended to be, for he hastened up to the door, lifted the latch, and walked in without ceremony.
the scene within was not quite the customary one. standing about the room was th

â€œo yes, it can soon be done,â€ said fairway, as if something should be added to make the statement complete.
he arose and followed the grandfer, and the rest also went to the door. in a moment an open fly was driven past, in which sat venn and mrs. venn, yeobright, and a grand relative of vennâ€™s who had come from budmouth for the occasion. the fly had been hired at the nearest town, regardless of distance and cost, there being nothing on egdon heath, in vennâ€™s opinion, dignified enough for such an event when such a woman as thomasin was the bride; and the church was too remote for a walking bridal-party.
as the fly passed the group which had run out from the homestead they shouted â€œhurrah!â€ and waved their hands; feathers and down floating from t

his native air, had grown stronger, but not sufficiently strong to warrant his attempting his extensive educational project. yet he did not repineâ€”there was still more than enough of an unambitious sort to tax all his energies and occupy all his hours.
evening drew on, and sounds of life and movement in the lower part of the domicile became more pronounced, the gate in the palings clicking incessantly. the party was to be an early one, and all the guests were assembled long before it was dark. yeobright went down the back staircase and into the heath by another path than that in front, intending to walk in the open air till the party was over, when he would return to wish thomasin and her husband good-bye as they departed. his steps were insensibly bent towards mistover by the path that he had followed on that terrible morning when he learnt the strange news from susanâ€™s boy.
he did not turn aside to the cottage, but pushed on to an eminence, whence he could see over the whole quarter that h

ad once been eustaciaâ€™s home. while he stood observing the darkening scene somebody came up. clym, seeing him but dimly, would have let him pass silently, had not the pedestrian, who was charley, recognized the young man and spoken to him.
â€œcharley, i have not seen you for a length of time,â€ said yeobright. â€œdo you often walk this way?â€
â€œno,â€ the lad replied. â€œi donâ€™t often come outside the bank.â€
â€œyou were not at the maypole.â€
â€œno,â€ said charley, in the same listless tone. â€œi donâ€™t care for that sort of thing now.â€
â€œyou rather liked miss eustacia, didnâ€™t you?â€ yeobright gently asked. eustacia had frequently told him of charleyâ€™s romantic attachment.
â€œyes, very much. ah, i wishâ€”â€
â€œyes?â€
â€œi wish, mr. yeobright, you could give me something to keep tha

they walked towards blooms-end together. when they reached the front it was dark, and the shutters were closed, so that nothing of the interior could be seen.
â€œcome round this way,â€ said clym. â€œmy entrance is at the back for the present.â€
the two went round and ascended the crooked stair in darkness till clymâ€™s sitting-room on the upper floor was reached, where he lit a candle, charley entering gently behind. yeobright searched his desk, and taking out a sheet of tissue-paper unfolded from it two or three undulating locks of raven hair, which fell over the paper like black streams. from these he selected one, wrapped it up, and gave it to the lad, whose eyes had filled with tears. he kissed the packet, put it in his pocket, and said in a voice of emotion, â€œo, mr. clym, how good you are to me!â€
â€œi will go a little way with you,â€ said clym. and amid the noise of merriment from below they descended. thei

â€œnow we leave you in absolute possession of your own house again,â€ said thomasin as she bent down to wish her cousin good night. â€œit will be rather lonely for you, clym, after the hubbub we have been making.â€
â€œo, thatâ€™s no inconvenience,â€ said clym, smiling rather sadly. and then the party drove off and vanished in the night shades, and yeobright entered the house. the ticking of the clock was the only sound that greeted him, for not a soul remained; christian, who acted as cook, valet, and gardener to clym, sleeping at his fatherâ€™s house. yeobright sat down in one of the vacant chairs, and remained in thought a long time. his motherâ€™s old chair was opposite; it had been sat in that evening by those who had scarcely remembered that it ever was hers. but to clym she was almost a presence there, now as always. whatever she was in othe
