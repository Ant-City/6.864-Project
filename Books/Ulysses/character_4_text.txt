buck mulligan’s gay voice went on.

—my name is absurd too: malachi mulligan, two dactyls. but it has a
hellenic ring, hasn’t it? tripping and sunny like the buck himself.
we must go to athens. will you come if i can get the aunt to fork out
twenty quid?

he laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:

—will he come? the jejune jesuit!

ceasing, he began to shave with care.

—tell me, mulligan, stephen said quietly.

—yes, my love?

—how long is haines going to stay in this tower?

buck mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.

—god, isn’t he dreadful? he said frankly. a ponderous saxon. he thinks
you’re not a gentleman. god, these bloody english! bursting with money
and indigestion. because he comes from oxford. you know, dedalus, you
have the real oxford manner. he can’t make you out. o, my name for you
is the best: kinch, the knife-blade.

—kinch ahoy!

buck mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower. it came nearer up the
staircase, calling again. stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry,
heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.

—dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. breakfast is ready. haines is
apologising for waking us last night. it’s all right.

—i’m coming, stephen said, turning.

—do, for jesus’ sake, buck mulligan said. for my sake and for all our
sakes.

his head disappeared and reappeared.

—i told him your symbol of irish art. he says it’s very clever. touch
him for a quid, will you? a guinea, i mean.

yet the same. a servant too. a server of a servant.

in the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower buck mulligan’s gowned form
moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its
yellow glow. two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor
from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of
coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.

—we’ll be choked, buck mulligan said. haines, open that door, will you?

stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. a tall figure rose from the
hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open
the inner doors.

—have you the key? a voice asked.

—dedalus has it, buck mulligan said. janey mack, i’m choked!

he howled, without looking up from the fire:

—kinch!

—it’s in the lock, stephen said, coming forward.

the key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been
set ajar, welcome light an

d bright air entered. haines stood at the
doorway, looking out. stephen haled his upended valise to the table and
sat down to wait. buck mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside
him. then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set
them down heavily and sighed with relief.

—i’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... but, hush! not a
word more on that subject! kinch, wake up! bread, butter, honey. haines,
come in. the grub is ready. bless us, o lord, and these thy gifts.
where’s the sugar? o, jay, there’s no milk.

stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from
the locker. buck mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.

—what sort of a kip is this? he said. i told her to come after eight.

—we can drink it black, stephen said thirstily. there’s a lemon in the
locker.

—o, damn you and your paris fads! buck mulligan said. i want sandycove

haines came in from

the doorway and said quietly:

—that woman is coming up with the milk.

—the blessings of god on you! buck mulligan cried, jumping up from his
chair. sit down. pour out the tea there. the sugar is in the bag. here,
i can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs.

he hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three
plates, saying:

—in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti.

haines sat down to pour out the tea.

—i’m giving you two lumps each, he said. but, i say, mulligan, you do
make strong tea, don’t you?

buck mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman’s
wheedling voice:

—when i makes tea i makes tea, as old mother grogan said. and when i
makes water i makes water.

—by jove, it is tea, haines said.

buck mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:

—so i do, mrs cahill, says she. begob, ma’am, says mrs cahill, god send

he lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled
on his knife.

lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of
dundrum. printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.

he turned to stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his
brows:

—can you recall, brother, is mother grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of
in the mabinogion or is it in the upanishads?

—i doubt it, said stephen gravely.

—do you now? buck mulligan said in the same tone. your reasons, pray?

he crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.

the doorway was darkened by an entering form.

—the milk, sir!

—come in, ma’am, mulligan said. kinch, get the jug.

an old woman came forward and stood by stephen’s elbow.

—that’s a lovely morning, sir, she said. glory be to god.

—to whom? mulligan said, glancing at her. ah, to be sure!

stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.

—the islanders, mulligan said to haines casually, speak frequently of
the collector of prepuces.

—how much, sir? asked the old woman.

—a quart, stephen said.

he watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white
milk, not hers. old shrunken paps. she poured again a measureful and
a tilly. old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe
a messenger. she praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.

is of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in

her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.

—do you understand what he says? stephen asked her.

—is it french you are talking, sir? the old woman said to haines.

haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.

—irish, buck mulligan said. is there gaelic on you?

—i thought it was irish, she said, by the sound of it. are you from the
west, sir?

—i am an englishman, haines answered.

—he’s english, buck mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak irish
in ireland.

—sure we ought to, the old woman said, and i’m ashamed i don’t speak the
language myself. i’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows.

—no, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the
milkcan on her forearm and about to go.

haines said to her:

—have you your bill? we had better pay her, mulligan, hadn’t we?

stephen filled again the three cups.

—bill, sir? she said, halting. well, it’s seven mornings a pint at
twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three
mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. that’s a
shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.

buck mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly
buttered on both sides, stretched forth his l

egs and began to search his
trouser pockets.

—pay up and look pleasant, haines said to him, smiling.

stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the
thick rich milk. buck mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in
his fingers and cried:

—a miracle!

he passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:

—ask nothing more of me, sweet. all i can give you i give.

stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.

—we’ll owe twopence, he said.

—time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. time enough. good morning,
sir.

she curtseyed

and went out, followed by buck mulligan’s tender chant:

     —heart of my heart, were it more,
     more would be laid at your feet.

he turned to stephen and said:

—seriously, dedalus. i’m stony. hurry out to your school kip and bring
us back some money. today the bards must drink and junket. ireland
expects that every man this day will do his duty.

—that reminds me, haines said, rising, that i have to visit your
national library today.

—our swim first, buck mulligan said.

he turned to stephen and asked blandly:

—is this the day for your monthly wash, kinch?

then he said to haines:

—the unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.

—all ireland is washed by the gulfstream, stephen said as he let honey
trickle over a slice of the loaf.

haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the
loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:

—that one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol
of irish art is deuced good.

buck mulligan kicked stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth
of tone:

—wait till you hear him on hamlet, haines.

—well, i mean it, haines said, still speaking to stephen. i was just
thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.

—would i make any money by it? stephen asked.

haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of
the hammock, said:

—i don’t know, i’m sure.

he strolled out to the doorway. buck mulligan bent across to stephen and
said with coarse vigour:

—you put your hoof in it now. what did you say that for?

—well? stephen said. the problem is to get money. from whom? from the

his talking hands.

—and there’s your latin quarter hat, he said.

stephen picked it up and put it on. haines called to them from the
doorway:

—are you coming, you fellows?

—i’m ready, buck mulligan answered, going towards the door. come out,
kinch. you have eaten all we left, i suppose. resigned he passed out
with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:

—and going forth he met butterly.

stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out
and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and
locked it. he put the huge key in his inner pocket.

—did you bring the key?

—i have it, stephen said, preceding them.

he walked on. behind him he heard buck mulligan club with his heavy
bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.

—down, sir! how dare you, sir!

haines asked:

—do you pay rent for this tower?

—twelve quid, buck mulligan said.

—to the secretary of state for war, stephen added over his shoulder.

they halted while haines surveyed the tower and said at last:

—rather bleak in wintertime, i should say. martello you call it?

—billy pitt had them built, buck mulligan said, when the french were on
the sea. but ours is the omphalos.

—what is your idea of hamlet? haines asked stephen.

—no, no, buck mulligan shouted in pain. i’m not equal to thomas aquinas
and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. wait till i
have a few pints in me first.

he turned to stephen, saying, as he pulled down neat

ly the peaks of his
primrose waistcoat:

—you couldn’t manage it under three pints, kinch, could you?

—it has waited so long, stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.

—you pique my curiosity, haines said amiably. is it some paradox?

—pooh! buck mulligan said. we have grown out of wilde and paradoxes.
it’s quite simple. he proves by algebra that hamlet’s grandson is
shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own
father.

—what? haines said, beginning to point at stephen. he himself?

buck mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in
loose laughter, said to stephen’s ear:

—o, shade of kinch the elder! japhet in search of a father!

—we’re always tired in the morning, stephen said to haines. and it is
rather long to tell.

buck mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.

—the sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of dedalus, he said.

smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail
tacking by the muglins.

father.

buck mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. he looked

 hands at his sides like fins or
wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:

     —goodbye, now, goodbye! write down all i said
     and tell tom, dick and harry i rose from the dead.
     what’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly
     and olivet’s breezy... goodbye, now, goodbye!

he capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his
winglike hands, leaping nimbly, mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh
wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.

haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside stephen and
said:

—we oughtn’t to laugh, i suppose. he’s rather blasphemous. i’m not a
believer myself, that is to say. still his gaiety takes the harm out of
it somehow, doesn’t it? what did he call it? joseph the joiner?

—the ballad of joking jesus, stephen answered.

—o, haines said, you have heard it before?

—three times a day, after meals, stephen said drily.

—you’re not a believer, are you? haines asked. i mean, a

believer in
the narrow sense of the word. creation from nothing and miracles and a
personal god.

—there’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, stephen said.

haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a
green stone. he sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.

—thank you, stephen said, taking a cigarette.

haines helped himself and snapped the case to. he put it back in his
sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang
it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk
towards stephen in the shell of his hands.

—yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. either you believe
or you don’t, isn’t it? personally i couldn’t stomach that idea of a
personal god. you don’t stand for that, i suppose?

—you behold in me, stephen said with grim displeasure

side. its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.

stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not
all unkind.

—after all, i should think you are able to free yourself. you are your
own master, it seems to me.

—i am a servant of two masters, stephen said, an english and an italian.

—italian? haines said.

haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he
spoke.

—i can quite understand that, he said calmly. an irishman must think
like that, i daresay. we feel in england that we have treated you rather
unfairly. it seems history is to blame.

stranger. idle mockery. the void awaits surely all them that weave the
wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels
of the church, michael’s host, who defend her ever in the hour of
conflict with their lances and their shields.

—of course i’m a britisher, haines’s voice said, and i feel as one. i
don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of german jews either.
that’s our national problem, i’m afraid, just now.

two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.

water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water
rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black
sagging loincloth.

buck mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at haines
and stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips
and breastbone.

the young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached

stephen followed a lubber...

one day in the national library we had a discussion. shakes. after. his
lub back: i followed. i gall his kibe.

stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt
head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of
no thought.

what have i learned? of them? of me?

walk like haines now.

the constant readers’ room. in the readers’ book cashel boyle o’connor
fitzmaurice tisdall farrell parafes his polysyllables. item: was hamlet
mad? the quaker’s pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.

—o please do, sir... i shall be most pleased...

amused buck mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding:

—a pleased bottom.

the turnstile.

is that?... blueribboned hat... idly writing... what? looked?...

      john eglinton, my jo, john,
      why won’t you wed a wife?

he spluttered to the air:

—o, the chinless chinaman! chin chon eg lin ton. we went over to their
playbox, haines and i, the plumbers’ hall. our players are creating a
new art for europe like the greeks or m. maeterlinck. abbey theatre! i
smell the pubic sweat of monks.

he spat blank.

forgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy lucy gave him. and
left the femme de trente ans. and why no other children born? and his
first child a girl?

he doorway he saw the horses pass parliament street,
harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. gaily they went past
before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. in saddles of the leaders,
leaping leaders, rode outriders.

—what was it? martin cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.

—the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of ireland, john wyse
nolan answered from the stairfoot.

as they trod across the thick carpet buck mulligan whispered behind his
panama to haines:

—parnell’s brother. there in the corner.

they chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose
beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.

—is that he? haines asked, twisting round in his seat.

—yes, mulligan said. that’s john howard, his brother, our city marshal.

john howard parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw
went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. an instant after, under
its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbrig

ht, at his foe and fell
once more upon a working corner.

—i’ll take a mélange, haines said to the waitress.

—two mélanges, buck mulligan said. and bring us some scones and butter
and some cakes as well.

when she had gone he said, laughing:

—we call it d.b.c. because they have damn bad cakes. o, but you missed
dedalus on hamlet.

haines opened his newbought book.

—i’m sorry, he said. shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds
that have lost their balance.

the onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 nelson street:

—england expects...

buck mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.

—you should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance. wandering
ængus i call him.

—i am sure he has an idée fixe, haines said, pinching his chin
thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. now i am

speculating what it
would be likely to be. such persons always have.

buck mulligan bent across the table gravely.

—they drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. he will never
capture the attic note. the note of swinburne, of all poets, the white
death and the ruddy birth. that is his tragedy. he can never be a poet.
the joy of creation...

—eternal punishment, haines said, nodding curtly. i see. i tackled him
this morning on belief. there was something on his mind, i saw.
it’s rather interesting because professor pokorny of vienna makes an
interesting point out of that.

buck mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the waitress come. he helped her to
unload her tray.

—he can find no trace of hell in ancient irish myth, haines said, amid
the cheerful cups. the moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny,
of retribution. rather strange he should have just that

 fixed idea. does
he write anything for your movement?

he sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.
buck mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its
smoking pith. he bit off a soft piece hungrily.

—ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. he is going to write
something in ten years.

—seems a long way off, haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.
still, i shouldn’t wonder if he did after all.

he tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.

—this is real irish cream i take it, he said with forbearance. i don’t
want to be imposed on.

ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new wapping
street past benson’s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner rosevean
from bridgwater with bricks.

osey flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. tom
rochford, seeing the eyes of lady dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs
quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap
to her. a charming soubrette, great marie kendall, with dauby cheeks and
lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon william humble, earl
of dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel h. g. heseltine, and also upon
the honourable gerald ward a. d. c. from the window of the d. b. c. buck
mulligan gaily, and haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage
over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the
chessboard whereon john howard parnell looked intently. in fownes’s
street dilly dedalus, straining her sight upward from chardenal’s first
french primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the
glare. john henry menton, filling the doorway of commercial buildings,
stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not
looked at in his fat left hand

 coadjutor deacon dedalus. hitherto silent, whether the
better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the
garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he
delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical
ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what god has joined.

but malachias’ tale began to freeze them with horror. he conjured up the
scene before them. the secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in
the recess appeared... haines! which of us did not feel his flesh creep!
he had a portfolio full of celtic literature in one hand, in the other
a phial marked poison. surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all
faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. i anticipated some such
reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history
is to blame. yes, it is true. i am the murderer of samuel childs.
and how i am punished! the inferno has no terrors for me. this is the
appearance is on me. tare and ages,

he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back.
an instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said: meet
me at westland row station at ten past eleven. he was gone. tears
gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host. the seer raised his hand
to heaven, murmuring: the vendetta of mananaun! the sage repeated: lex
talionis. the sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring
the immense debtorship for a thing done. malachias, overcome by emotion,
ceased. the mystery was unveiled. haines was the third brother. his
real name was childs. the black panther was himself the ghost of his own
father. he drank drugs to obliterate. for this relief much thanks. the
lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited. no soul will live there.
the spider pitches her web in the solitude. the nocturnal rat peers from
his hole. a curse is on it. it is haunted. murderer’s ground.

chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to
