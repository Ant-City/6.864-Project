ed in water-colour; they
embroidered; they copied verses into albums. once a week they went to
mass; once a week to the confessional, accompanied by an old nurse. they
were happy since they had known no other life.

it appeared to them a singular extravagance when, one day, a
photographer was brought over from the county town and photographed them
standing, all seven, in the shadow of an old apple tree with the grey
lichen on the raddled trunk. but it wasn't an extravagance.

three weeks before colonel powys had written to colonel ashburnham:

"i say, harry, couldn't your edward marry one of my girls? it would be
a god-send to me, for i'm at the end of my tether and, once one girl
begins to go off, the rest of them will follow." he went on to say that
all his daughters were tall, upstanding, clean-limbed and absolutely
pure, and he reminded colonel ashburnham that, they having been married
on the same day, though in different churches, since the one was a
catholic and the other an anglican--they ha

e things such as the teething of
edward and of the earlier daughters or the best way to repair a jacob's
ladder in a stocking. and, if they met seldom, yet it was often enough
to keep each other's personalities fresh in their minds, gradually
growing a little stiff in the joints, but always with enough to talk
about and with a store of reminiscences. then, as his girls began
to come of age when they must leave the convent in which they were
regularly interned during his years of active service, colonel powys
retired from the army with the necessity of making a home for them. it
happened that the ashburnhams had never seen any of the powys girls,
though, whenever the four parents met in london, edward ashburnham was
always of the party. he was at that time twenty-two and, i believe,
almost as pure in mind as leonora herself. it is odd how a boy can have
his virgin intelligence untouched in this world.

that was partly due to the careful handling of his mother, partly to the
fact that the house to wh

on, after having
been at lord's, she noticed edward suddenly turn his head round to take
a second look at a well-dressed girl who had passed them. she wrote
about that, too, to mrs powys, and expressed some alarm. it had been,
on edward's part, the merest reflex action. he was so very abstracted at
that time owing to the pressure his crammer was putting upon him that he
certainly hadn't known what he was doing.

it was this letter of mrs ashburnham's to mrs powys that had caused
the letter from colonel powys to colonel ashburnham--a letter that was
half-humorous, half longing. mrs ashburnham caused her husband to
reply, with a letter a little more jocular--something to the effect
that colonel powys ought to give them some idea of the goods that he
was marketing. that was the cause of the photograph. i have seen it, the
seven girls, all in white dresses, all very much alike in feature--all,
except leonora, a little heavy about the chins and a little stupid about
the eyes. i dare say it would have ma

ut i dare say that was nonsense. at any rate, it
was over the question of the chapel that they had their first and
really disastrous quarrel. edward at that time was not well; he supposed
himself to be overworked with his regimental affairs--he was managing
the mess at the time. and leonora was not well--she was beginning to
fear that their union might be sterile. and then her father came over
from glasmoyle to stay with them.

those were troublesome times in ireland, i understand. at any rate,
colonel powys had tenants on the brain--his own tenants having shot at
him with shot-guns. and, in conversation with edward's land-steward,
he got it into his head that edward managed his estates with a
mad generosity towards his tenants. i understand, also, that those
years--the 'nineties--were very bad for farming. wheat was fetching only
a few shillings the hundred; the price of meat was so low that cattle
hardly paid for raising; whole english counties were ruined. and edward
allowed his tenants very hig

to do both justice leonora has since acknowledged that she was in the
wrong at that time and that edward was following out a more far-seeing
policy in nursing his really very good tenants over a bad period. it was
not as if the whole of his money came from the land; a good deal of it
was in rails. but old colonel powys had that bee in his bonnet and, if
he never directly approached edward himself on the subject, he preached
unceasingly, whenever he had the opportunity, to leonora. his pet idea
was that edward ought to sack all his own tenants and import a set of
farmers from scotland. that was what they were doing in essex. he was of
opinion that edward was riding hotfoot to ruin.

that worried leonora very much--it worried her dreadfully; she lay
awake nights; she had an anxious line round her mouth. and tha
