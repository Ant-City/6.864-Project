i must weigh at least fifty or sixty 
pounds less than the smallest career. 
now i smile. â€œhowâ€™s everything with you?â€ i call down 
cheerfully. 
this takes them aback, but i know the crowd will love it. 
â€œwell enough,â€ says the boy from district 2. â€œyourself?â€ 
â€œitâ€™s been a bit warm for my taste,â€ i say. i can almost hear 
the laughter from the capitol. â€œthe airâ€™s better up here. why 
donâ€™t you come on up?â€ 
â€œthink i will,â€ says the same boy. 
â€œhere, take this, cato,â€ says the girl from district 1, and she 
offers him the silver bow and sheath of arrows. my bow! my 
arrows! just the sight of them makes me so angry i want to 
scream, at myself, at that traitor peeta for distracting me from 
having them. i try to make eye contact with him now, but he 
seems to be intentionally avoiding my gaze as he polishes his 
knife with the edge of his shirt.

â€œno,â€ says cato, pushing away the bow. â€œiâ€™ll do better with 
my sword.â€ i can see the

weapon, a short, heavy blade at his 
belt. i give cato time to hoist himself into the tree before i begin 
to climb again. gale always says i remind him of a squirrel the 
way i can scurry up even the slenderest limb. part of itâ€™s my 
weight, but part of itâ€™s practice. you have to know where to 
place your hands and feet. iâ€™m another thirty feet in the air 
when i hear the crack and look down to see cato flailing as he 
and a branch go down. he hits the ground hard and iâ€™m hoping 
he possibly broke his neck when he gets back to his feet, 
swearing like a fiend. 
the girl with the arrows, glimmer i hear someone call her 
â€” ugh, the names the people in district 1 give their children 
are so ridiculous â€” anyway glimmer scales the tree until the 
branches begin to crack under her feet and then has the good 
sense to stop. iâ€™m at least eighty feet high now. she tries to 
shoot me and itâ€™s

his side. 
â€œwhat are you still doing here?â€ he hisses at me. i stare un-
comprehendingly as a trickle of water drips off a sting under 
his ear. his whole body starts sparkling as if heâ€™s been dipped 
in dew. â€œare you mad?â€ heâ€™s prodding me with the shaft of the 
spear now. â€œget up! get up!â€ i rise, but heâ€™s still pushing at me. 
what? what is going on? he shoves me away from him hard. 
â€œrun!â€ he screams. â€œrun!â€

cares? that i can work with. 
the weapons give me an entirely new perspective on the 
games. i know i have tough opponents left to face. but i am no

measures. if cato broke through the trees right now, i 
wouldnâ€™t flee, iâ€™d shoot. i find iâ€™m actually anticipating the 
moment with pleasure. 
but first, i have to get some strength back in my body. iâ€™m

low. the little padding i was able to put on by gorging myself

admire her cleverness. itâ€™s right at the edge of the wood, but 
the bushy foliage is so thick down low i can easily observe the 
career camp without being spotted. between us lies the flat 
expanse where the games began. 
there are four tributes. the boy from district 1, cato and 
the girl from district 2, and a scrawny, ashen-skinned boy 
who must be from district 3. he made almost no impression 
on me at all during our time in the capitol. i can remember 
almost nothing about him, not his costume, not his training 
score, not his interview. even now, as he sits there fiddling 
with some kind of plastic box, heâ€™s easily ignored in the pres-
ence of his large and domineering companions. but he must 
be of some value or they wouldnâ€™t have bothered to let him

thingâ€™s for sure, destroying those supplies is not going to be as 
simple as it looks. some other factor is at play here, and iâ€™d 
better stay put until i figure out what it is. my guess is the py-
ramid is booby-trapped in some manner. i think of concealed 
pits, descending nets, a thread that when broken sends a poi-
sonous dart into your heart. really, the possibilities are end-
less. while i am mulling over my options, i hear cato shout out. 
heâ€™s pointing up to the woods, far beyond me, and without 
turning i know that rue must have set the first campfire. weâ€™d 
made sure to gather enough green wood to make the smoke 
noticeable. the careers begin to arm themselves at once. 
an argument breaks out. itâ€™s loud enough for me to hear 
that it concerns whether or not the boy from district 3 should 
stay or accompany them. 
â€œheâ€™s coming. we need him in the woods, and his jobâ€™s done 
here anyway. no one can touch t

â€œwhat about lover boy?â€ says the boy from district 1. 
â€œi keep telling you, forget about him. i know where i cut 
him. itâ€™s a miracle he hasnâ€™t bled to death yet. at any rate, heâ€™s 
in no shape to raid us,â€ says cato. 
so peeta is out there in the woods, wounded badly. but i am 
still in the dark on what motivated him to betray the careers. 

214 

 

 

â€œcome on,â€ says cato. he thrusts a spear into the hands of 
the boy from district 3, and they head off in the direction of 
the fire. the last thing i hear as they enter the woods is cato 
saying, â€œwhen we find her, i kill her in my own way, and no 
one interferes.â€ 
somehow i donâ€™t think heâ€™s talking about rue. she didnâ€™t 
drop a nest of tracker jackers on him. 
i stay put for a half an hour or so, trying to figure out what 
to do about the supplies. the one advantage i have with the 
bow and arrow is di

can i crawl? i move forward tentatively. yes, if i go very slow-
ly, i can crawl. most of the woods will offer insufficient cover. 
my only hope is to make it back to rueâ€™s copse and conceal 
myself in greenery. i canâ€™t get caught out here on my hands 
and knees in the open. not only will i face death, itâ€™s sure to be 
a long and painful one at catoâ€™s hand. the thought of prim 
having to watch that keeps me doggedly inching my way to-
ward the hideout. 
another blast knocks me flat on my face. a stray mine, set 
off by some collapsing crate. this happens twice more. iâ€™m 
reminded of those last few kernels that burst when prim and i 
pop corn over the fire at home. 
to say i make it in the nick of time is an understatement. i 
have literally just dragged myself into the tangle of hushes at 
the base of the trees when thereâ€™s cato, bar

off the last bits of nail polish, trying to keep my teeth from 
chattering. 
the boy from district 3 throws stones into the ruins and 
must have declared all the mines activated because the ca-
reers are approaching the wreckage. 
cato has finished the first phase of his tantrum and takes 
out his anger on the smoking remains by kicking open various 
containers. the other tributes are poking around in the mess, 
looking for anything to salvage, but thereâ€™s nothing. the boy 
from district 3 has done his job too well. this idea must occur 
to cato, too, because he turns on the boy and appears to be 
shouting at him. the boy from district 3 only has time to turn 
and run before cato catches him in a headlock from behind. i

the grim determination on all their faces. the careers stride 
back into the woods to hunt. 
the dizziness has subsided and while my left ear is still 
deafened, i can hear a ringing in my right, which seems a good

didnâ€™t he just lose his entire stash of supplies? 
let the seventy-fourth hunger games begin, cato, i think. let

to shiver. since roosting overnight in a tree isnâ€™t sensible an-

i doubt they think peeta has lit this signal fire. catoâ€™s sure 
heâ€™s as good as dead. i find myself wishing i could tell peeta 
about the flowers i put on rue. that i now understand what 
he was trying to say on the roof. perhaps if he wins the games, 
heâ€™ll see me on victorâ€™s night, when they replay the highlights 
of the games on a screen over the stage where we did our in-
terviews. the winner sits in a place of honor on the platform, 
surrounded by their support crew.

alive. shaking his head to keep me from running to the cornu-
copia. fighting cato to let me escape. even hooking up with 
the careers must have been a move to protect me. peeta, it 
turns out, has never been a danger to me. 
the thought makes me smile. i drop my hands and hold my 
face up to the moonlight so the cameras can be sure to catch it. 
so, who is there left to be afraid of? foxface? the boy tri-
bute from her district is dead. sheâ€™s operating alone, at night. 
and her strategy has been to evade, not attack. i donâ€™t really 
think that, even if she heard my voice

een him, not once, since the games began. i think 
about how foxface grew alarmed when she heard a sound at 
the site of the explosion. but she didnâ€™t turn to the woods, she 
turned to whatever lies across from it. to that area of the are-
na that drops off into i donâ€™t know what. i feel almost certain 
that the person she ran from was thresh and that is his do-
main. heâ€™d never have heard me from there and, even if he 
did, iâ€™m up too high for someone his size to reach. 
so that leaves cato and the girl from district 2, who are 
now surely celebrating the new rule. theyâ€™re the only ones left 
who benefit from it besides peeta and myself. do i run from 
them now, on the chance they heard me call peetaâ€™s name? no, 
i think. let them come. let them come with their night-vision

without any assistance. but if heâ€™s that incapacitated, how has 
he managed to stay alive? and how on earth will i find him? 
i try to think of anything peeta ever said that might give me 
an indication as to where heâ€™s hiding out, but nothing rings a 
bell. so i go back to the last moment i saw him sparkling in the 
sunlight, yelling at me to run. then cato appeared, his sword 
drawn. and after i was gone, he wounded peeta. but how did 
peeta get away? maybe heâ€™d held out better against the track-
er jacker poison than cato. 
maybe that was the variable that allowed him to escape. 
but heâ€™d been stung, too. so how far could he have gotten,

doesnâ€™t surprise me. iâ€™ve been up and down this stretch three 
times since the tracker jacker incident. if he were nearby, 
surely iâ€™d have had some suspicion of it. the stream begins to 
curve to the left into a part of the woods thatâ€™s new to me. 
muddy banks covered in tangled water plants lead to large 
rocks that increase in size until i begin to feel somewhat 
trapped. it would be no small matter to escape the stream 
now. fighting off cato or thresh as i climbed over this rocky 
terrain. in fact, iâ€™ve just about decided iâ€™m on the wrong track 
entirely, that a wounded boy would be unable to navigate get-
ting to and from this water source, when i see the bloody 
streak going down the curve of a boulder. itâ€™s long dried now, 
but the smeary lines running side to side suggest someone â€” 
who perhaps was not fully in control of his mental faculties â€” 
tried to wipe it away.

bruised with a long burn across his chest and four tracker 
jacker stings, if you count the one under his ear. but i feel a bit 
better. this much i can fix. i decide to take care of his upper

since treating his wounds seems pointless when heâ€™s lying

very pale in the sunlight and he no longer looks strong and 
stocky. i have to dig the stingers out of his tracker jacker

to get him to eat a few bits of dried apple. â€œthanks. iâ€™m much

â€œsoon,â€ i promise. â€œi need to look at your leg first.â€ trying to

â€œcan you speed it up a little?â€ he asks. 
â€œno. shut up and eat your pears,â€ i say. 
after three applications and what seems like a bucket of 
pus, the wound does look better. now that the swelling has 
gone down, i can see how deep catoâ€™s sword cut. right down 
to the bone. 
â€œwhat next, dr. everdeen?â€ he asks. 
â€œmaybe iâ€™ll put some of the burn ointment on it. i think it 
helps with infection anyway. and wrap it up?â€ i say. i do and 
the whole thing seems a lot more manageable, covered in 
clean white cotton. although, against the sterile bandage, the

tributes, how theyâ€™re managing now that their main source of 
food has been blown up. at least three of them, cato, clove,

slams into me, knocking me flat on my back, pinning my 
shoulders to the ground, with her knees. 
this is it, i think, and hope for primâ€™s sake it will be fast. but 
clove means to savor the moment. even feels she has time. no

thresh and possibly peeta.

the truth. since no peeta appears to save me, she turns back to 
me. â€œliar,â€ she says with a grin. â€œheâ€™s nearly dead. cato knows 
where he cut him. youâ€™ve probably got him strapped up in 
some tree while you try to keep his heart going. whatâ€™s in the 
pretty little backpack? that medicine for lover boy? too bad 
heâ€™ll never get it.â€ 
clove opens her jacket. itâ€™s lined with an impressive array 
of knives. she carefully selects an almost dainty-looking num-
ber with a cruel, curved blade. â€œi promised cato if he let me 
have you, iâ€™d give the audience a good show.â€

that, towering over me, holding clove like a rag doll. i remem-
ber him as big, but he seems more massive, more powerful 
than i even recall. if anything, he seems to have gained weight 
in the arena. he flips clove around and flings her onto the 
ground. when he shouts, i jump, never having heard him speak 
above a mutter. â€œwhatâ€™d you do to that little girl? you kill 
her?â€ 

282 

 

 

clove is scrambling backward on all fours, like a frantic in-
sect, too shocked to even call for cato. â€œno! no, it wasnâ€™t me!â€ 
â€œyou said her name. i heard you. you kill her?â€ another 
thought brings a fresh wave of rage to his features. â€œyou cut 
her up like you were going to cut up this girl here?â€ 
â€œno! no, i â€”â€ clove sees the stone, about the size of a small 
loaf of bread in threshâ€™s hand and loses it. â€œcato!â€ she 
screeches. â€œcato!â€ 
â€œclove!â€ i hear catoâ€™s answer, but heâ€™s too far away, i can 
tell that much, to do her any good. what was he doing? try

and points at me, almost accusingly. â€œjust this one time, i 
let you go. for the little girl. you and me, weâ€™re even then. no 
more owed. you understand?â€ 
i nod because i do understand. about owing. about hating 
it. i understand that if thresh wins, heâ€™ll have to go back and 
face a district that has already broken all the rules to thank 
me, and he is breaking the rules to thank me, too. and i under-
stand that, for the moment, thresh is not going to smash in 
my skull. 
â€œclove!â€ catoâ€™s voice is much nearer now. i can tell by the 
pain in it that he sees her on the ground. 
â€œyou better run now, fire girl,â€ says thresh. 
i donâ€™t need to be told twice. i flip over and my feet dip into 
the hard-packed earth as i run away from thresh and clove 
and the sound of catoâ€™s voice. only when i reach the woods do 
i turn back for an instant. thresh and both large backpacks 
are vanishing over the edge of the plain into the area iâ€™ve nev-
er seen. cato kneels beside clove, s

to stay with him. in a moment, he will realize itâ€™s futile, she 
canâ€™t be saved. i crash into the trees, repeatedly swiping away 
the blood thatâ€™s pouring into my eye, fleeing like the wild, 
wounded creature i am. after a few minutes, i hear the cannon 
and i know that clove has died, that cato will be on one of our 
trails. either threshâ€™s or mine. iâ€™m seized with terror, weak 
from my head wound, shaking. i load an arrow, but cato can 
throw that spear almost as far as i can shoot. 
only one thing calms me down. thresh has catoâ€™s backpack 
containing the thing he needs desperately. if i had to bet, cato 
headed out after thresh, not me. still i donâ€™t slow down when 
i reach the water. i plunge right in, boots still on, and flounder 
downstream. i pull off rueâ€™s socks that iâ€™ve been using for 
gloves and press them into my forehead, trying to staunch the 
flow of blood, but theyâ€™re soaked in minutes.

lightning electrify the sky through an opening in the rocks. 
rain drips through several holes in the ceiling, but peeta has 
built a sort of canopy over my head an upper body by wedging 
the square of plastic into the rock above me. 
â€œi wonder what brought on this storm? i mean, whoâ€™s the 
target?â€ says peeta. 
â€œcato and thresh,â€ i say without thinking. â€œfoxface will be 
in her den somewhere, and clove . . . she cut me an then . . .â€ 
my voice trails off. 
â€œi know cloveâ€™s dead. i saw it in the sky last night,â€ h says. 
â€œdid you kill her?â€ 
â€œno. thresh broke her skull with a rock,â€ i say. 
â€œlucky he didnâ€™t catch you, too,â€ says peeta. 
the memory of the feast returns full-force and i feel sick. 
â€œhe did. but he let me go.â€ then, of course, i have to tell him.

â€œbut you didnâ€™t know me. we had never even spoken. be-

wouldnâ€™t even have been here to do it if you hadnâ€™t helped me 
then,â€ i say. â€œwhy did you, anyway?â€ 
â€œwhy? you know why,â€ peeta says. i give my head a slight, 
painful shake. â€œhaymitch said you would take a lot of convinc-
ing.â€ â€œhaymitch?â€ i ask. â€œwhatâ€™s he got to do with it?â€ 
â€œnothing,â€ peeta says. â€œso, cato and thresh, huh? i guess 
itâ€™s too much to hope that theyâ€™ll simultaneously destroy each 
other?â€ 
but the thought only upsets me. â€œi think we would like 
thresh. i think heâ€™d be our friend back in district twelve,â€ i 
say. â€œthen letâ€™s hope cato kills him, so we donâ€™t have to,â€ says 
peeta grimly. 
i donâ€™t want cato to kill thresh at all. i donâ€™t want anyone 
else to die. but this is absolutely not the kind of thing that vic-
tors go around saying in the arena. despite m

that,â€ peeta says. â€œiâ€™ve never 
hunted before.â€ 
â€œiâ€™ll kill and you cook,â€ i say. â€œand you can always gather.â€ 
â€œi wish there was some sort of bread bush out there,â€ says 
peeta. 
â€œthe bread they sent me from district eleven was still 
warm,â€ i say with a sigh. â€œhere, chew these.â€ i hand him a 
couple of mint leaves and pop a few in my own mouth. 
itâ€™s hard to even see the projection in the sky, but itâ€™s clear 
enough to know there were no more deaths today. so cato 
and thresh havenâ€™t had it out yet. 
â€œwhere did thresh go? i mean, whatâ€™s on the far side of the 
circle?â€ i ask peeta. 
â€œa field. as far as you can see itâ€™s full of grasses as high as 
my shoulders. i donâ€™t know, maybe some of them are grain. 
there are patches of different colors. but there are no paths,â€ 
says peeta. 
â€œi bet some of them are grain. i bet thresh knows which 
ones, too,â€ i say. â€œdid you go in there?â€ 
â€œno. nobody really wanted to track thresh down in

a thought hits me, and iâ€™m amazed the questionâ€™s taken so 
long to surface. maybe itâ€™s because iâ€™ve only recently begun to 
view haymitch with a degree of curiosity. â€œhow do you think 
he did it?â€ 
â€œwho? did what?â€ peeta asks. 
â€œhaymitch. how do you think he won the games?â€ i say. 
peeta considers this quite a while before he answers. hay-
mitch is sturdily built, but no physical wonder like cato or 
thresh. heâ€™s not particularly handsome. not in the way that 
causes sponsors to rain gifts on you. and heâ€™s so surly, itâ€™s 
hard to imagine anyone teaming up with him. thereâ€™s only 
one way haymitch could have won, and peeta says it just as 
iâ€™m reaching this conclusion myself. 
â€œhe outsmarted the others,â€ says peeta. 
i nod, then let the conversation drop. but secretly iâ€™m won-
dering if haymitch sobered up long enough to help peeta and 
me because he thought we just might

didnâ€™t win . . . i wanted thresh to. because he let me go. and 
because of rue.â€ 
â€œyeah, i know,â€ says peeta. â€œbut this means weâ€™re one step 
closer to district twelve.â€ he nudges a plate of foot into my 
hands. â€œeat. itâ€™s still warm.â€ 
i take a bite of the stew to show i donâ€™t really care, but itâ€™s 
like glue in my mouth and takes a lot of effort to swallow. â€œit 
also means cato will be back hunting us.â€ 
â€œand heâ€™s got supplies again,â€ says peeta. 
â€œheâ€™ll be wounded, i bet,â€ i say. 
â€œwhat makes you say that?â€ peeta asks. 
â€œbecause thresh would have never gone down without a 
fight. heâ€™s so strong, i mean, he was. and they were in his ter-
ritory,â€ i say. 
â€œgood,â€ says peeta. â€œthe more wounded cato is the better. i 
wonder how foxface is making out.â€ 
â€œoh, sheâ€™s fine,â€ i say peevishly. iâ€™m still angry she thought 
of hiding in the

â€œmaybe theyâ€™ll catch each other and we can just go home,â€ 
says peeta. â€œbut we better be extra careful about the watches. 
i dozed off a few times.â€ 
â€œme, too,â€ i admit. â€œbut not tonight.â€ 
we finish our food in silence and then peeta offers to take 
the first watch. i burrow down in the sleeping bag next to him, 
pulling my hood up over my face to hide it from the cameras. i 
just need a few moments of privacy where i can let any emo-
tion cross my

even cold, itâ€™s one of the best things iâ€™ve ever tasted. i 
abandon my fork and scrape up the last dabs of gravy with my 
finger. â€œi can feel effie trinket shuddering at my manners.â€ 
â€œhey, effie, watch this!â€ says peeta. he tosses his fork over 
his shoulder and literally licks his plate clean with his tongue 
making loud, satisfied sounds. then he blows a kiss out to her 
in general and calls, â€œwe miss you, effie!â€ 
i cover his mouth with my hand, but iâ€™m laughing. â€œstop! 
cato could be right outside our cave.â€ 
he grabs my hand away. â€œwhat do i care? iâ€™ve got you to 
protect me now,â€ says peeta, pulling me to him. 
â€œcome on,â€ i say in exasperation, extricating myself from 
his grasp but not before he gets in another kiss. 
once weâ€™re packed up and standing outside our cave, our 
mood shifts to serious. itâ€™s as though for the last few days, 
sheltered by the rocks and the rain and catoâ€™s preoccupation 
with thresh, we were given a respite, a holiday

although the day is sunny and warm, we both sense weâ€™re re-
ally back in the games. i hand peeta my knife, since whatever 
weapons he once had are long gone, and he slips it into his 
belt. my last seven arrows â€” of the twelve i sacrificed three in 
the explosion, two at the feast â€” rattle a bit too loosely in the 
quiver. i canâ€™t afford to lose any more. 
â€œheâ€™ll be hunting us by now,â€ says peeta. â€œcato isnâ€™t one to 
wait for his prey to wander by.â€ 
â€œif heâ€™s wounded â€”â€ i begin. 
â€œit wonâ€™t matter,â€ peeta breaks in. â€œif he can move, heâ€™s 
coming.â€ with all the rain, the stream has overrun its banks by sev-
eral feet on either side. we stop there to replenish our water. i 
check the snares i set days ago and come up empty. not sur-
prising with the weather. besides, i havenâ€™t seen many ani-
mals or signs of them in this area. 
â€œif we want food, we better head back up

s along the knife cut, but after three days the bleeding has

stopped. i wear a bandage around my head though, just in 
case physical exertion should bring it back. 
as we head up alongside the stream, we pass the place 
where i found peeta camouflaged in the weeds and mud. one 
good thing, between the downpour and the flooded banks, all 
signs of his hiding place have been wiped out. that means 
that, if need be, we can come back to our cave. otherwise, i 
wouldnâ€™t risk it with cato after us. 
the boulders diminish to rocks that eventually turn to peb-
bles, and then, to my relief, weâ€™re back on pine needles and the 
gentle incline of the forest floor. for the first time, i realize we 
have a problem. navigating the rocky terrain with a bad leg â€” 
well, youâ€™re naturally going to make some noise. but even on 
the smooth bed of needles, peeta is loud. and i mean  loud 
loud, as if heâ€™s stomping his feet or something. i turn and look 
at him. 
â€œwhat?â€ he asks.

ment, i could 
swear heâ€™s making an effort to snap every branch we encoun-
ter. needless to say, although it takes several hours to reach my 
old camp with rue, iâ€™ve shot nothing. if the stream would set-
tle down, fish might be an option, but the current is still too 
strong. as we stop to rest and drink water, i try to work out a 
solution. ideally, iâ€™d dump peeta now with some simple root-
gathering chore and go hunt, but then heâ€™d be left with only a 
knife to defend himself against catoâ€™s spears and superior 
strength. so what iâ€™d really like is to try and conceal him 
somewhere safe, then go hunt, and come back and collect him. 
but i have a feeling his ego isnâ€™t going to go for that sugges-
tion. â€œkatniss,â€ he says. â€œwe need to split up. i know iâ€™m chasing 
away the game.â€ 
â€œonly because your legâ€™s hurt,â€ i say generously, because 
really, you can tell thatâ€™s only a small part of the problem. 
â€œi know,â€ he says. â€œso, why donâ€™t you go on? show

plants to gather and that way weâ€™ll both be useful.â€ 
â€œnot if cato comes and kills you.â€ i tried to say it in a nice

surprisingly, he just laughs. â€œlook, i can handle cato. i 
fought him before, didnâ€™t i?â€ 
yeah, and that turned out great. you ended up dying in a 
mud bank. thatâ€™s what i want to say, but i canâ€™t. he did save 
my life by taking on cato after all. i try another tactic. â€œwhat if 
you climbed up in a tree and acted as a lookout while i 
hunted?â€ i say, trying to make it sound like very important 
work. 
â€œwhat if you show me whatâ€™s edible around here and go get 
us some meat?â€ he says, mimicking my tone. â€œjust donâ€™t go far, 
in case you need help.â€ 
i sigh and show him some roots to dig. we do need food, no 
question. one apple, two rolls, and a blob of cheese the size of 
a plum wonâ€™t last long. iâ€™ll just go

a short distance and hope 
cato is a long way off. 
i teach him a bird whistle â€” not a melody like rueâ€™s but a 
simple two-note whistle â€” which we can use to communicate 
that weâ€™re all right. fortunately, heâ€™s good at this. leaving him 
with the pack, i head off. 
i feel like iâ€™m eleven again, tethered not to the safety of the 
fence but to peeta, allowing myself twenty, maybe thirty yards 
of hunting space. away from him though, the woods come 
alive with animal sounds. reassured by his periodic whistles, i

foliage. my fear comes out as anger. â€œwhat are you doing? youâ€™re 
supposed to be here, not running around in the woods!â€ 
â€œi found some berries down by the stream,â€ he says, clearly 
confused by my outburst. 
â€œi whistled. why didnâ€™t you whistle back?â€ i snap at him. 
â€œi didnâ€™t hear. the waterâ€™s too loud, i guess,â€ he says. he 
crosses and puts his hands on my shoulders. thatâ€™s when i 
feel that iâ€™m trembling. 
â€œi thought cato killed you!â€ i almost shout. 
â€œno, iâ€™m fine.â€ peeta wraps his arms around me, but i donâ€™t 
respond. â€œkatniss?â€ 
i push away, trying to sort out my feelings. â€œif two people 
agree on a signal, they stay in range. because if one of them 
doesnâ€™t answer, theyâ€™re in trouble, all right?â€ 
â€œall right!â€ he says. 
â€œall right. because thatâ€™s what happened with rue, and i 
watched her die!â€ i say. i turn away from him, go to the pack

heâ€™ll be here in a second. weâ€™ll stand a better chance fighting

i stop him, suddenly calm. â€œno, peeta, sheâ€™s your kill, not 
catoâ€™s.â€ 
â€œwhat? i havenâ€™t even seen her since the first day,â€ he says. 
â€œhow could i have killed her?â€ 
in answer, i hold out the berries.

  it takes a while to explain the situation to peeta. how fox-
face stole the food from the supply pile before i blew it up, 
how she tried to take enough to stay alive but not enough that 
anyone would notice it, how she wouldnâ€™t question the safety 
of berries we were preparing to eat ourselves. 
â€œi wonder how she found us,â

e the same ones youâ€™d gathered.â€ 
â€œdonâ€™t apologize. it just means weâ€™re one step closer to 
home, right?â€ i ask. 
â€œiâ€™ll get rid of the rest,â€ peeta says. he gathers up the sheet 
of blue plastic, careful to trap the berries inside, and goes to 
toss them into the woods. 

316 

 

 

â€œwait!â€ i cry. i find the leather pouch that belonged to the 
boy from district 1 and fill it with a few handfuls of berries 
from the plastic. â€œif they fooled foxface, maybe they can fool 
cato as well. if heâ€™s chasing us or something, we can act like 
we accidentally drop the pouch and if he eats them â€”â€ 
â€œthen hello district twelve,â€ says peeta. 
â€œthatâ€™s it,â€ i say, securing the pouch to my belt. 
â€œheâ€™ll know where we are now,â€ says peeta. â€œif he was any-
where nearby and saw that hovercraft, heâ€™ll know we killed 
her and come after us.â€ 
peetaâ€™s right. this could be just the opportunity catoâ€™s been 
waiting for. but even if we run now, thereâ€™s the

thereâ€™s two of us and probably assumes we were hunting fox-
face. that means youâ€™re recovered. and the fire means weâ€™re 
not hiding, weâ€™re inviting him here. would you show up?â€ i 
ask. â€œmaybe not,â€ he says. 
peetaâ€™s a whiz with fires, coaxing a blaze out of the damp 
wood. in no time, i have the rabbits and squirrel roasting, the 
roots, wrapped in leaves, baking in the coals. we take turns 
gathering greens and keeping a careful watch for cato, but as i 
anticipated, he doesnâ€™t make an appearance. 

317 

 

 

when the foodâ€™s cooked, i pack most of it up, leaving us 
each a rabbitâ€™s leg to eat as we walk. 
i want to move higher into the woods, climb a good tree, 
and make camp for the night, but peeta resists. â€œi canâ€™t climb 
like you, katniss, especially with my leg, and i donâ€™t think i 
could ever fall asleep fifty feet above the ground.â€

to leave in the morning to hunt. but peeta doesnâ€™t ask for 
much. heâ€™s followed my instructions all day and iâ€™m sure if 
things were reversed, he wouldnâ€™t make me spend the night in 
a tree. it dawns on me that i havenâ€™t been very nice to peeta 
today. nagging him about how loud he was, screaming at him 
over disappearing. the playful romance we had sustained in 
the cave has disappeared out in the open, under the hot sun, 
with the threat of cato looming over us. haymitch has proba-
bly just about had it with me. and as for the audience . . . 
i reach up and give him a kiss. â€œsure. letâ€™s go back to the 
cave.â€ he looks pleased and relieved. â€œwell, that was easy.â€ 
i work my arrow out of the oak, careful not to damage the 
shaft. these arrows are food, safety, and life itself now. 
we toss a bunch more wood on the fire. it should be send-

the water has dropped considerably and moves at its old lei-
surely pace, so i suggest we walk back in it. peetaâ€™s happy to 
oblige and since heâ€™s a lot quieter in water than on land, itâ€™s a 
doubly good idea. itâ€™s a long walk back to the cave though, 
even going downward, even with the rabbit to give us a boost. 
weâ€™re both exhausted by our hike today and still way too un-
derfed. i keep my bow loaded, both for cato and any fish i 
might see, but the stream seems strangely empty of creatures. 
by the time we reach our destination, our feet are dragging 
and the sun sits low on the horizon. we fill up our water bot-
tles and climb the little slope to our den. itâ€™s not much, but out 
here in the wilderness, itâ€™s the closest thing we have to a 
home. it will be warmer than a tree, too, because it provides 
some shelter from the wind that has begun to blow steadily in 
from the west. i set a good dinner ou

peeta begins to nod off. after days of inactivity, the hunt has 
taken its toll. i order him into the sleeping bag and set aside 
the rest of his food for when he wakes. he drops off imme-
diately. i pull the sleeping bag up to his chin and kiss his fore-
head, not for the audience, but for me. because iâ€™m so grateful 
that heâ€™s still here, not dead by the stream as iâ€™d thought. so 
glad that i donâ€™t have to face cato alone. 
brutal, bloody cato who can snap a neck with a twist of his 
arm, who had the power to overcome thresh, who has had it 
out for me since the beginning. he probably has had a special 
hatred for me ever since i outscored him in training. a boy 
like peeta would simply shrug that off. but i have a feeling it 
drove cato to distraction. which is not that hard. i think of his

the sky lights up with the seal, and i watch foxface shine in 
the sky and then disappear from the world forever. he hasnâ€™t 
said it, but i donâ€™t think peeta felt good about killing her, even 
if it was essential. i canâ€™t pretend iâ€™ll miss her, but i have to 
admire her. my guess is if they had given us some sort of test, 
she would have been the smartest of all the tributes. if, in fact, 
we had been setting a trap for her, i bet sheâ€™d have sensed it 
and

brought her down. iâ€™ve spent so much time making sure i 
donâ€™t underestimate my opponents that iâ€™ve forgotten itâ€™s just 
as dangerous to overestimate them as well. 
that brings me back to cato. but while i think i had a sense 
of foxface, who she was and how she operated, heâ€™s a little 
more slippery. powerful, well trained, but smart? i donâ€™t 
know. not like she was. and utterly lacking in the control fox-
face demonstrated. i believe cato could easily lose his judg-
ment in a fit of temper. not that i can feel superior on that 
point. i think of the moment i sent the arrow flying into the 
apple in the pigâ€™s mouth when i was so enraged. maybe i do 
understand cato better than

â€œletâ€™s go now, while weâ€™ve had food and rest. letâ€™s just go 
end this thing,â€ he says. 
i nod. itâ€™s funny. i feel almost as if itâ€™s the first day of the 
games again. that iâ€™m in the same position. twenty-one tri-
butes are dead, but i still have yet to kill cato. and really, 
wasnâ€™t he always the one to kill? now it seems the other tri-
butes were just minor obstacles, distractions, keeping us from 
the real battle of the games. cato and me. 
but no, thereâ€™s the boy waiting beside me. i feel his arms 
wrap around me. 
â€œtwo against one. should be a piece of cake,â€ he says. 
â€œnext time we eat, it will be in the capitol,â€ i answer. 
â€œyou bet it will,â€ he says. 
we stand there a while, locked in an embrace, feeling each 
other, the sunlight

, the rustle of the leaves at our feet. then 
without a word, we break apart and head for the lake. 
i donâ€™t care now that peetaâ€™s footfalls send rodents scurry-
ing, make birds take wing. we have to fight cato and iâ€™d just as 
soon do it here as on the plain. but i doubt iâ€™ll have that 
choice. if the gamemakers want us in the open, then in the 
open we will be. 
we stop to rest for a few moments under the tree where 
the careers trapped me. the husk of the tracker jacker nest, 
beaten to a pulp by the heavy rains and dried in the burning 
sun, confirms the location. i touch it with the tip of my boot, 
and it dissolves into dust that is quickly carried off by the 
breeze. i canâ€™t help looking

â€œletâ€™s move on,â€ i say, wanting to escape the darkness that 
surrounds this place. peeta doesnâ€™t object. 
given our late start to the day, when we reach the plain itâ€™s 
already early evening. thereâ€™s no sign of cato. no sign of any-
thing except the gold cornucopia glowing in the slanting sun 
rays. just in case cato decided to pull a foxface on us, we cir-
cle the cornucopia to make sure itâ€™s empty. then obediently, 
as if following instructions, we cross to the lake and fill our 
water containers. 
i frown at the shrinking sun. â€œwe donâ€™t want to fight him af-
ter dark. thereâ€™s only the one pair of glasses.â€ 
peeta carefully squeezes drops of iodine into the water.

someone start it at quitting time, i wonder, now that she is

the beauty of the song. then something begins to disrupt the 
music. runs cut off in jagged, imperfect lines. dissonant notes 
intersperse with the melody. the mockingjaysâ€™ voices rise up 
in a shrieking cry of alarm. 
weâ€™re on our feet, peeta wielding his knife, me poised to 
shoot, when cato smashes through the trees and bears down 
on us. he has no spear. in fact, his hands are empty, yet he 
runs straight for us. my first arrow hits his chest and inexplic-
ably falls aside. 
â€œheâ€™s got some kind of body armor!â€ i shout to peeta. 
just in time, too, because cato is upon us. i brace myself, 
but he rockets right between us with no attempt to check his

purplish face, that heâ€™s been running hard a long time. not t

  muttations. no question about it. iâ€™ve never seen these 
mutts, but theyâ€™re no natural-born animals. they resemble 
huge wolves, but what wolf lands and then balances easily on 
its hind legs? what wolf waves the rest of the pack forward 
with its front paw as though it had a wrist? these things i can 
see at a distance. up close, iâ€™m sure their more menacing 
attributes will be revealed. 
cato has made a beeline for the

heâ€™s right. i canâ€™t protect either of us on the ground. i start 
climbing, scaling the cornucopia on my hands and feet. the 
pure gold surface has been designed to resemble the woven 
horn that we fill at harvest, so there are little ridges and seams

to get a decent hold on. but after a day in the arena sun, the 
metal feels hot enough to blister my hands. 
cato lies on his side at the very top of the horn, twenty feet 
above the ground, gasping to catch his breath as he gags over 
the edge. nowâ€™s my chance to finish him off. i stop midway up 
the horn and load another arrow, but just as iâ€™m about to let it 
fly, i hear peeta cry out. i twist around and see heâ€™s just 
reached the tail, and the mutts are right on his heels. 
â€œclimb!â€ i yell. peeta starts up hampered by not only the leg 
but the knife in his hand. i shoot my arrow down the thro

the first mutt that places its paws on the metal. as it dies the 
creature lashes out, inadvertently opening gashes on a few of 
its companions. thatâ€™s when i get a look at the claws. four 
inches and clearly razor-sharp. 
peeta reaches my feet and i grab his arm and pull him 
along. then i remember cato waiting at the top and whip 
around, but heâ€™s doubled over with cramps and apparently 
more preoccupied with the mutts than us. he coughs out 
something unintelligible. the snuffling, growling sound com-
ing from the mutts isnâ€™t helping. 
â€œwhat?â€ i shout at him. 
â€œhe said, â€˜can they climb it?â€™â€ answers peeta, drawing my 
focus back to the base of the horn. 
the mutts are beginning to assemble. as they join together, 
they raise up again to stand easily on their back legs giving

not for the grip on my arm, heâ€™d be on the ground, but as it is, 
it takes all my strength to keep us both on the curved back of 
the horn. and more tributes are coming. 

329 

 

 

â€œkill it, peeta! kill it!â€ iâ€™m shouting, and although i canâ€™t 
quite see whatâ€™s happening, i know he must have stabbed the 
thing because the pull lessens. iâ€™m able to haul him back onto 
the horn where we drag ourselves toward the top where the 
lesser of two evils awaits. 
cato has still not regained his feet, but his breathing is 
slowing and i know soon heâ€™ll be recovered enough to come 
for us, to hurl us over the side to our deaths. i arm my bow, 
but the arrow ends up taking out a mutt that can only be 
thresh. who else could jump so high? i feel a momentâ€™s relief 
because we must finally be up above the mutt line and iâ€™m just 
turning back to face cato when peetaâ€™s jerked from my side. 
iâ€™m sure the pack has got him until his blood splatters my face. 

 
 ___________________________
 
cato stands before me, almost at the lip of the horn, holding 
peeta in some kind of headlock, cutting off his air. peetaâ€™s 
clawing at catoâ€™s arm, but weakly, as if confused over whether 
itâ€™s more important to breathe or try and stem the gush of 
blood from the gaping hole a mutt left in his calf. 
i aim one of my last two arrows at catoâ€™s head, knowing itâ€™ll 
have no effect on his trunk or limbs, which i can now see are 
clothed in a skintight, flesh-colored mesh. some high-grade 
body armor from the capitol. was that what was in his pack at 
the feast? body armor to defend against my arrows? well, 
they neglected to send a face guard. 
cato just laughs. â€œshoot me and he goes down with me.â€ 
heâ€™s right. if i take him out and he falls to the mutts, peeta 
is sure to die with him. weâ€™ve reached a stalemate. i canâ€™t

both of us seeking an out. 
my muscles are strained so tightly, they feel they might 
snap at any moment. my teeth clenched to the breaking point. 
the mutts go silent and the only thing i can hear is the blood 
pounding in my good ear. 
peetaâ€™s lips are turning blue. if i donâ€™t do something quick-
ly, heâ€™ll die of asphyxiation and then iâ€™ll have lost him

 and cato 
will probably use his body as a weapon against me. in fact, iâ€™m 
sure this is catoâ€™s plan because while heâ€™s stopped laughing, 
his lips are set in a triumphant smile. 
as if in a last-ditch effort, peeta raises his fingers, dripping 
with blood from his leg, up to catoâ€™s arm. instead of trying to 
wrestle his way free, his forefinger veers off and makes a deli-
berate  x on the back of catoâ€™s hand. cato realizes what it 
means exactly one second after i do. i can tell by the way the 
smile drops from his lips. but itâ€™s one second too late because, 
by that time, my arrow is piercing his hand. he cries out and 
reflexively releases peeta who slams back against him. for a 
horrible moment, i think theyâ€™re both going over. i dive for-
ward just catching hold of peeta as cato loses his footing on 
the blood-slick horn and plummets to the ground. 
we hear him hit, the air leaving his body on im

pact, and 
then the mutts attack him. peeta and i hold on to each other, 
waiting for the cannon, waiting for the competition to finish, 
waiting to be released. but it doesnâ€™t happen. not yet. because 
this is the climax of the hunger games, and the audience ex-
pects a show.

i donâ€™t watch, but i can hear the snarls, the growls, the 
howls of pain from both human and beast as cato takes on the 
mutt pack. i canâ€™t understand how he can be surviving until i 
remember the body armor protecting him from ankle to neck 
and i realize what a long night this could be. cato must have a 
knife or sword or something, too, something he had hidden in 
his clothes, because on occasion thereâ€™s the death scream of a 
mutt or the sound of metal on metal as the blade collides with 
the golden horn. the combat moves around the side of the 
cornucopia, and i know cato must be attempting

 the one ma-
neuver that could save his life â€” to make his way back around 
to the tail of the horn and rejoin us. but in the end, despite his 
remarkable strength and skill, he is simply overpowered. 
i donâ€™t know how long it has been, maybe an hour or so, 
when cato hits the ground and we hear the mutts dragging 
him, dragging him back into the cornucopia. now theyâ€™ll finish 
him off, i think. but thereâ€™s still no cannon. 
night falls and the anthem plays and thereâ€™s no picture of 
cato in the sky, only the faint moans coming through the met-
al beneath us. the icy air blowing across the plain reminds me 
that the games are not over and may not be for who knows 
how long, and there is still no guarantee of victory. 
i turn my attention to peeta and discover his leg is bleeding 
as badly as ever. all our supplies, our packs, remain down by 
the lake where we abandoned them when we fled from the 
mutts. i have no bandage, nothing to staunch the flow of blood 
from his calf. alth

o sleep,â€ i tell him. iâ€™m not sure if this is exactly 
medical protocol, but iâ€™m terrified that if he drifts off heâ€™ll 
never wake again. 
â€œare you cold?â€ he asks. he unzips his jacket and i press 
against him as he fastens it around me. itâ€™s a bit warmer, shar-
ing our body heat inside my double layer of jackets, but the 
night is young. the temperature will continue to drop. 
even now i can feel the cornucopia, which burned so when 
i first climbed it, slowly turning to ice. 
â€œcato may win this thing yet,â€ i whisper to peeta. 
â€œdonâ€™t you believe it,â€ he says, pulling up my hood, but heâ€™s 
shaking harder than i am. 
the next hours are the worst in my life, which if you think 
about it, is saying something. the cold would be torture 
enough, but the real nightmare is listening to cato, moaning,

at him. after a very short time, i donâ€™t care who he is or what

 i acknowledge its progress and sometimes, 
for just a moment i feel a flicker of hope before the agony of 
the night engulfs me again.

eyes and find the stars fading in the pale light of dawn. i can 
see, too, how bloodless peetaâ€™s face has become. how little

time he has left. and i know i have to get him back to the capi-
tol. still, no cannon has fired. i press my good ear against the 
horn and can just make out catoâ€™s voice. 
â€œi think heâ€™s closer now. katniss, can you shoot him?â€ peeta 
asks. if heâ€™s near the mouth, i may be able to take him out. it 
would be an act of mercy at this point. 
â€œmy last arrowâ€™s in your tourniquet,â€ i say. 
â€œmake it count,â€ says peeta, unzipping his jacket, letting me 
loose. so i free the arrow, tying the tourniquet back as tightly as 
my frozen fingers can manage. i rub my hands together, trying 
to regain circulation. when i crawl to the lip of the horn a

it takes a few moments to find cato in the dim light, in the 
blood. then the raw hunk of meat that used to be my enemy 
makes a sound, and i know where his mouth is. and i think 
the word heâ€™s trying to say is please. 
pity, not vengeance, sends my arrow flying into his skull. 
peeta pulls me back up, bow in hand, quiver empty. 
â€œdid you get him?â€ he whispers. 
the cannon fires in answer. 
â€œthen we won, katniss,â€ he says hollowly. 
â€œhurray for us,â€ i get out, but thereâ€™s no joy of victory in my 
voice.

a hole opens in the plain and as if on cue, the remaining 
mutts bound into it, disappearing as the earth closes above 
them. we wait, for the hovercraft to take catoâ€™s remains, for the 
trumpets of victory that should follow, but nothing happens. 
â€œhey!â€ i shout into air. â€œwhatâ€™s going on?â€ the only re-
sponse is the chatter of waking birds. 
â€œmaybe itâ€™s the body. maybe we have to move away from 
it,â€ says peeta. 
i try to remember. do you have to distance yourself from 
the dead tribute on the final kill? my brain is too muddled to 
be sure, but what else could be the reason for the delay? 
â€œokay. think you could make it to the lake?â€
 
 ___________________________
 
 i ask. 
â€œthink i better try,â€ says peeta. we inch down to the tail of 
the horn and fall to the ground. if the stiffness in my limbs is 
this bad, how can peeta even move? i rise first, swinging and 
bending my arms and legs until i think i can help him up. 
somehow, we make it back to the lake. i scoop up a handful of 
the cold water for peeta and bring a second to my lips. 
a mockingjay gives the long, low whistle, and tears of relief 
fill my eyes as the hovercraft appears and takes catoâ€™s body 
away. now they will take us. now we can go home. 
but again thereâ€™s no response. 
â€œwhat are they waiting for?â€ says peeta weakly. between 
the loss of the tourniquet and the effort it took to get to the 
lake, his wound has opened up again. 
â€œi donâ€™t know,â€ i say. whatever the holdup is, i canâ€™t watch 
him lose any more blood. i get up to find a stick but almost

with the arrow pointed straight at his heart. peeta raises his 
eyebrows and i see the knife has already left his hand on its 
way to the lake where it splashes in the water. i drop my wea-
pons and take a step back, my face burning in what can only 
be shame. 
â€œno,â€ he says. â€œdo it.â€ peeta limps toward me and thrusts 
the weapons back in my hands. 
â€œi canâ€™t, i say. â€œi wonâ€™t.â€ 
â€œdo it. before they send those mutts back or something. i 
donâ€™t want to die like cato,â€ he says.

â€œthen you shoot me,â€ i say furiously, shoving the weapons 
back at him. â€œyou shoot me and go home and live with it!â€ and 
as i say it, i know death right here, right now would be the 
easier of the two. 
â€œyou know i canâ€™t,â€ peeta says, discarding the weapons. 
â€œfine, iâ€™ll go first anyway.â€ he leans down and rips the ban-
dage off his leg, eliminating the final barrier between his 
blood and the earth. 
â€œno, you canâ€™t kill yourself,â€ i say. i

even while he lay in that mud bank, whispered my name in his

happens to people i have never met. 
and then comes the moment with the berries. i can hear 
the audience hushing one another, not wanting to miss any-
thing. a wave of gratitude to the filmmakers sweeps over me 
when they end not with the announcement of our victory, but 
with me pounding on the glass door of the hovercraft, scream-

in terms of survival, itâ€™s my best moment all night.
