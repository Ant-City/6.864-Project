had appeal around the world. grant was
besieged with requests for interviews, lectures, books. characteristically, he turned them all
down, wanting only to continue his excavations. but it was during those frantic days of the mid-
1980s that he was approached by the ingen corporation with a request for consulting services.
"had you heard of ingen before?" morris asked. "no."
"how did they contact you?"
"telephone call. it was a man named gennaro or gennino, something like that."
morris nodded. "donald gennaro," he said. "he's the legal counsel for ingen."
"anyway, he wanted to know about eating habits of dinosaurs. and he offered me a fee to
draw up a paper for him." grant drank his beer, set the can on the floor. "gennaro was
particularly interested in young dinosaurs. infants and juveniles. what they ate. i guess he
thought i would know about that."
"did you?"
"not really, no. i told him that. we had found lots of skeletal material, but we had very little
dietary data. but gennaro said he knew we

you be there at five p.m. tomorrow and i'll be waiting for you. take you right down. can you and
dr. sattler make that plane?"
"i guess we can."
"good. pack lightly. you don't need passports. i'm looking forward to it. see you tomorrow,"
hammond said, and he hung up.
cowan, swain and ross
midday sun streamed into the san francisco law offices of cowan, swain and ross, giving the
room a cheerfulness that donald gennaro did not feel. he listened on the phone and looked at
his boss, daniel ross, cold as an undertaker in his dark pinstripe suit.
"i understand, john," gennaro said. "and grant agreed to come? good, good . . . yes, that
sounds fine to me. my congratulations, john." he hung up the phone and turned to ross.
"we can't trust hammond any more. he's under too much pressure. the epa's investigating
him, he's behind schedule on his costa rican resort, and the investors are getting nervous.

 according to the
report, some new kind of lizard is biting children on the coast."
ross blinked. "new lizard?"
"yes," gennaro said. "we can't screw around with this. we've got to inspect that island right
away. i've asked hammond to arrange independent site inspections every week for the next
three weeks."
"and what does hammond say?"
"he insists nothing is wrong on the island. claims he has all these security precautions."
"but you don't believe him," ross said.
"no," gennaro said. "i don't."
donald gennaro had come to cowan, swain from a background in investment banking.
cowan, swain's high-tech clients frequently needed capitalization, and gennaro helped them find
the money. one of his first assignments, back in 1982, had been to accompany john hammond
while the old man, then nearly seventy, put together the funding to start the ingen corporation.
they eventually raised almost a billion dollars, and gcnnaro remembered it as a wild ride.
"hammond's a dreamer," gennaro said.
"a potentially dangero

 ross said. "you're making the arrangements?"
"hammond asked to place the calls himself. i think he wants to pretend that he's not in trouble,
that it's just a social invitation. showing off his island."
"all right," ross said. "but just make sure it happens. stay on top of it. i want this costa rican
situation resolved within a week." ross got up, and walked out of the room.
gennaro dialed, heard the whining hiss of a radiophone. then he heard a voice say, "grant
here."
"hi, dr. grant, this is donald gennaro. i'm the general counsel for ingen. we talked a few
years back, i don't know if you remember-"
"i remember," grant said.
"well," gennaro said. "i just got off the phone with john hammond, who tells me the good
news that you're coming down to our island in costa rica. . . ."
"yes," grant said. "i guess we're going down there tomorrow."
"well, i just want to extend my thanks to you for doing this on short notice. everybody at ingen
appreciates it. we've asked fan malcolm, who like you was one of

would give it. that was how patronage worked-how it had always worked.
the little jet landed and rolled quickly toward them. ellie shouldered her bag. the iet came to a
stop and a stewardess in a blue uniform opened the door.
inside, he was surprised at how cramped it was, despite the luxurious appointments. grant
had to hunch over as he went to shake hammond's hand.
"dr. grant and dr. sattler," hammond said. "it's good of you to join us. allow me to introduce
my associate, donald gennaro."
gennaro was a stocky, muscular man in his mid-thirties wearing an armani suit and wire-frame
glasses. grant disliked him on sight. he shook hands quickly. when ellie shook hands, gennaro
said in surprise, "you're a woman."
"these things happen," she said, and grant thought: she doesn't like him, eitherhammond
turned to gennaro. "you know, of course, what dr. grant and dr. sattler do. they
are paleontologists. they dig up dinosaurs." and then he began to laugh, as if he found the idea

way we can find anything out there is with the motion sensors. if the kids are alive and moving
around, the motion sensors will pick them up, and we can go right to them and bring them back.
but if we don't take dr. malcolm back right now, he'll die."
"then we have to go back," gennaro said.
"yes, i think so."
they climbed into the car. gennaro said, "are you going to tell hammond the kids are
missing?"
"no," muldoon said. "you are."

donald gennaro stared at hammond, sitting in the deserted cafeteria. the man was spooning ice
cream, calmly eating it. "so muldoon believes the children are somewhere in the park?"
"he thinks so, yes."
"then i'm sure we'll find them."
"i hope so," gennaro said. he watched the old man deliberately eating, and he felt a chill.
"oh, i am sure we'll find them. after all, i keep telling everyone, this park is made for kids."
gennaro said, "just so you understand that they're missing, sir." 
"missing?" he snapped.

would to have to shut down all the fences.
"control. this is muldoon. we're ready to begin repair." "all
right," arnold said. "shutting out your section now."
muldoon glanced at his watch. somewhere in the distance, he heard soft hooting. it sounded
like owls, but he knew it was the dilophosaurs. he went over to ramÂ¢n and said, "let's finish this
up. i want to get to those other sections of fence."
an hour went by. donald gennaro stared at the glowing map in the control room as the spots and
numbers flickered and changed. "what's happening now?"
arnold worked at the console. "i'm trying to get the phones back. so we can call about
malcolm."
"no, i mean out there."
arnold glanced up at the board. "it looks as if they're about done with the animals, and the two
sections. just as i told you, the park is back in band. with no catastrophic malcolm effect. in fact,
there's just that third section of fence. . . ."

back, the raptor was gone.

the raptor jerked his head, and donald gennaro was yanked off his feet, and he fell.
lying in bed, soaked in sweat, malcolm listened as the radio crackled. "anything?" muldoon said.

"no word," wu said. "hell,"
muldoon said, there was a

malcolm sighed. "i can't wait," he said, "to hear his new plan."
