[CHARACTER]  - 
      the voice of goodness and religiosity in the play, [CHARACTER] is the wife of corvino, who is extremely beautiful, enough to drive both volpone and corvino to distraction. she is absolutely committed to her husband, even though he treats her horribly, and has a faith in god and sense of honor, traits which seem to be lacking in both corvino and volpone. these traits guide her toward self- restraint and self-denial. her self-restraint makes her a foil for volpone, who suffers a complete absence of that quality.
