    with very easy arguments of love,
    which now the manage of two kingdoms must

of france,

  king philip. before angiers well met, brave austria.
    arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,
    richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart
    and fought the holy wars in palestine,
    by this brave duke came early to his grave;
    and for amends to his posterity,
    at our importance hither is he come
    to spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf;
    and to rebuke the usurpation
    of thy unnatural uncle, english john.

    in any breast of strong authority
    to look into the blots and stains of right.
    that judge hath made me guardian to this boy,
    under whose warrant i impeach thy wrong,
    and by whose help i mean to chastise it.
  king john. alack, thou dost usurp authority.
  king philip. excuse it is to beat usurping down.
  elinor. who is it thou dost call usurper, france?
  constance. let me make answer: thy usurping son.
  elinor. out, insolent! thy bastard shall be king,
    that thou mayst be a queen and check the world!
  constance. my bed was ever to thy son as true
    as thine was to thy husband; and this boy
    liker in feature to his father geffrey
    than thou and john in manners-being as like
    as rain to water, or devil to his dam.

    resembling majesty, which, being touch'd and tried,

    you came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,

    there was not such a gracious creature born.
    but now will canker sorrow eat my bud
    and chase the native beauty from his cheek,
    and he will look as hollow as a ghost,
    as dim and meagre as an ague's fit;
    and so he'll die; and, rising so again,
    when i shall meet him in the court of heaven
    i shall not know him. therefore never, never
    must i behold my pretty arthur more.
  pandulph. you hold too heinous a respect of grief.
  constance. he talks to me that never had a son.
  king philip. you are as fond of grief as of your child.
  constance. grief fills the room up of my absent child,
    lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,
    puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,
    remembers me of all his gracious parts,
    stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;
    then have i reason to be fond of grief.
    fare you well; had you such a loss as i,
    i could give better comfort than you do.
    i will

  king john. o, where hath our intelligence been drunk?
    where hath it slept? where is my mother's care,
    that such an army could be drawn in france,
    and she not hear of it?
  messenger. my liege, her ear
    is stopp'd with dust: the first of april died
    your noble mother; and as i hear, my lord,
    the lady constance in a frenzy died
    three days before; but this from rumour's tongue
    i idly heard-if true or false i know not.
  king john. withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!
    o, make a league with me, till i have pleas'd
    my discontented peers! what! mother dead!
    how wildly then walks my estate in france!
    under whose conduct came those pow'rs of france
    that thou for truth giv'st out are landed here?
  messenger. under the dauphin.
  king john. thou hast made me giddy
