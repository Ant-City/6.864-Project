particles  called weak gauge bosons  and gluons.  (the  name gluon is particularly descriptive: you
can think of gluons as the microscopic ingredient in the strong glue holding atomic nuclei together.)
by 1984 experimenters had definitively established the existence and the detailed properties of these
three kinds of force particles, recorded in table 1.2. physicists believe that the gravitational force
also  has  an  associated  particle—the  graviton—but  its  existence  has  yet  to  be  confirmed
experimentally.

the second common feature of the forces is that just as mass determines how gravity affects a
particle,  and  electric  charge  determines  how  the  electromagnetic  force  affects  it,  particles  are
endowed  with  certain  amounts  of  "strong  charge"  and  "weak  charge"  that  determine  how  they  are
affected by the strong and weak forces. (these properties are detailed in the table in the endnotes to
this chapter.1) b

serves only to compound the questions. why, for instance, are there four fundamenta

around  us  is  that  most  things  are  composed  of  an  equal  amount  of  positive  and  negative  electric
charges whose forces cancel each other out. on the other hand, since gravity is always attractive,
there are no analogous cancellations—more stuff means greater gravitational force. but fundamentally
speaking, gravity is an extremely feeble force. (this fact accounts for the difficulty in experimentally
confirming  the  existence  of  the  graviton.  searching  for  the  smallest  bundle  of  the  feeblest  force  is
quite a challenge.) experiments also have shown that the strong force is about one hundred times as
strong as the electromagnetic force and about one hundred thousand times as strong as the weak force.
but where is the rationale—the raison d'être—for our universe having these features?

this is not a question born of idle philosophizing about why certain details happen to be one
way instead of another; the universe would

physics  is  unchanged  by—it  is  completely  insensitive  to—these  force-charge  shifts.  for  historical
reasons, physicists also say that the strong force symmetry is an example of a gauge symmetry.5

the smallest bundle of a gravitational force field, the graviton, would be its messenger particle. at
first sight, as we now note, this suggestion would appear to be particularly apt because the quantum
field theory of the three nongravitational forces reveals that there is a tantalizing similarity between
them and an aspect of the gravitational force we encountered in chapter 3.

here  is  the  essential  point.  just  as  the  symmetry  between  all  possible  observational  vantage

ned additional messenger-like particles that did not appear to have
any relevance to experimental observations of the strong force. in 1974, schwarz and joël scherk of
the  ecole  normale  superieure  made  a  bold  leap  that  transformed  this  apparent  vice  into  a  virtue.
after  studying  the  puzzling  messenger-like  patterns  of  string  vibration,  they  realized  that  their
properties matched perfectly those of the hypothesized messenger particle of the gravitational force—
the  graviton. although  these  "smallest  bundles"  of  the  gravitational  force  have,  as  yet,  never  been
seen, theorists can confidently predict certain basic features that they must possess, and scherk and

schwarz found these properties to be realized exactly by certain vibrational patterns. based on this,
scherk and schwarz suggested that string theory had failed in its initial attempt because physicists had
unduly constrained its scope. string theory is not just a theory of the strong force, the

a vis other forces. the electric charge, the weak charge, and the strong charge carried by a particular
string, for instance, are determined by the precise way it vibrates. moreover, exactly the same idea
holds for the messenger particles themselves. particles like photons, weak gauge bosons, and gluons
are yet other resonant patterns of string vibration. and of particular importance, among the vibrational
string patterns, one matches perfectly the properties of the graviton, ensuring that gravity is an integral
part of string theory.7

so we see that, according to string theory, the observed properties of each elementary particle
arise because its internal string undergoes a particular resonant vibrational pattern. this perspective
differs sharply from that espoused by physicists before the discovery of string theory; in the earlier
perspective the differences among the fundamental particles were explained by saying that, in effect,

rresponding tension on its loops. how is this tension determined? well,
if we could pluck a fundamental string we would learn about its stiffness, and in this way we could
measure its tension much as is done to measure the tension of more familiar everyday strings. but
since fundamental strings are so tiny, this approach cannot be carried out and a more indirect method
is  called  for.  in  1974,  when  scherk  and  schwarz  proposed  that  one  particular  pattern  of  string
vibration was the graviton particle, they were able to exploit such an indirect approach and thereby
predict the tension on the strings of string theory. their calculations revealed that the strength of the
force transmitted by the proposed graviton pattern of string vibration is inversely proportional to the
string's tension. and since the graviton is supposed to transmit the gravitational force—a force that is
intrinsically quite feeble—they found that this implies a colossal tension of a thousand billion billion

particle masses shown in tables 1.1 and 1.2. it is these lowest energy vibrational patterns, therefore,
that  should  provide  contact  between  the  theoretical  description  of  strings  and  the  experimentally
accessible world of particle physics. as an important example, scherk and schwarz found that for the
vibrational  pattern  whose  properties  make  it  a  candidate  for  the  graviton  messenger  particle,  the
energy  cancellations  are perfect,  resulting  in  a  zero-mass  gravitational-force  particle.  this  is
precisely what is expected for the graviton; the gravitational force is transmitted at light speed and
only massless particles travel at this maximal velocity. but low-energy vibrational combinations are

therefore,  it  seemed  impossible  to  find  a  sensible  quantum  theory  based  on  anything  but  point
particles.  the  truly  impressive  feature  of  string  theory  is  that  more  than  twenty  years  of  exacting
research has shown that although certain features are unfamiliar, string theory does respect all of the
requisite properties inherent in any sensible physical theory. and furthermore, through its graviton
pattern of vibration, string theory is a quantum theory containing gravity.

the more precise answer

the rough answer captures the essence of why string theory prevails where previous point-particle
theories failed. and so, if you like, you can go on to the next section without losing the logical flow of
our  discussion.  but  having  developed  the  essential  ideas  of  special  relativity  in  chapter  2,  we
already have the necessary tools for describing more accurately how string theory

if we apply exactly the same reasoning to the interaction of point particles, as summarized in
figure 6.11, we recover the conclusion stated earlier—there is a definite point in space and moment
in time when the point particles interact. point particles cram all of their interaction into a definite
point.  when  the  force  involved  in  an  interaction  is  the  gravitational  force—that  is,  when  the
messenger particle involved in the interaction is the graviton instead of the photon—this complete
packing of the force's punch into a single point leads to disastrous results, such as the infinite answers
we alluded to earlier. strings, by contrast, "smear" out the place where interactions occur. because
different observers perceive that the interaction takes place at various locations along the left part of
the  surface  of  figure  6.10,  in  a  real  sense  this  means  that  the  interaction  location  is  smeared  out
among all of them. this spread

beyond strings?

strings  are  special  for  two  reasons.  first,  even  though  they  are  spatially  extended  they  can  be
described  consistently  in  the  framework  of  quantum  mechanics.  second,  among  the  resonant
vibrational patterns there is one that has the exact properties of the graviton, thus ensuring that the
gravitational  force  is  an  intrinsic  part  of  its  structure.  but  just  as  string  theory  shows  that  the
conventional notion of zero-dimensional point particles appears to be a mathematical idealization that
is not realized in the real world, might it also be the case that an infinitely thin one-dimensional strand
is similarly a mathematical idealization? might it actually be the case that strings have some thickness

e  the  value  1/2  is,  roughly  speaking,  a  quantum-mechanical
measure  of  how  quickly  the  particles  rotate.2  moreover,  physicists  have  shown  that  the
nongravitational force carriers—photons, weak gauge bosons, and gluons—also possess an intrinsic
spinning characteristic that turns out to be twice that of the matter particles. they all have "spin-1."

what  about  gravity?  well,  even  before  string  theory,  physicists  were  able  to  determine  what
spin the hypothesized graviton must have to be the transmitter of the gravitational force. the answer:
twice the spin of photons, weak gauge bosons, and gluons—i.e., "spin-2."

in the context of string theory, spin—just like mass and force charges—is associated with the
pattern of vibration that a string executes. as with point particles, it's a bit misleading to think of the
spin carried by a string as arising from its spinning literally around in space, but this image does give
a loose picture to have in mind. by the

 way, we can now clarify an important issue we encountered
earlier. in 1974, when scherk and schwarz proclaimed that string theory should be thought of as a
quantum theory incorporating the gravitational force, they did so because they had found that strings
necessarily  have  a  vibrational  pattern  in  their  repertoire  that  is massless  and  has  spin-2—the
hallmark features of the graviton. where there is a graviton there is also gravity.

as we have emphasized, the concept of spin, although superficially akin to the image of a spinning
top, differs in substantial ways that are rooted in quantum mechanics. its discovery in 1925 revealed
that  there  is  another  kind  of  rotational  motion  that  simply  would  not  exist  in  a  purely  classical

gravity."1 what witten means by this is that both newton and einstein developed theories of gravity
because their observations of the world clearly showed them that gravity exists, and that, therefore, it
required an accurate and consistent explanation. on the contrary, a physicist studying string theory—
even if he or she was completely unaware of general relativity—would be inexorably led to it by the
string framework. through its massless spin-2 graviton pattern of vibration, string theory has gravity
thoroughly sewn into its theoretical fabric. as witten has said, "the fact that gravity is a consequence
of  string  theory  is  one  of  the  greatest  theoretical  insights  ever."2  in  acknowledging  that  this
"prediction" is more precisely labeled a "postdiction" because physicists had discovered theoretical
descriptions of gravity before they knew of string theory, witten points out that this is a mere accident
of history on earth. in other

 of the messenger particles of the fundamental forces, listed in
table 1.2. that is, as strings twist and vibrate while meandering through the extended and curled-up
dimensions, a small subset of their vast oscillatory repertoire consists of vibrations with spin equal to
1 or 2. these are the candidate force-carrying string-vibrational states. regardless of the shape of the
calabi-yau space, there is always one vibrational pattern that is massless and has spin-2; we identify
this pattern as the graviton. the precise list of spin-1 messenger particles—their number, the strength
of the force they convey, the gauge symmetries they respect—though, does depend crucially on the
precise geometrical form of the curled-up dimensions. and so, once again, we come to realize that
string  theory  provides  a  framework  for  explaining  the  observed  messenger-particle  content  of  our
universe,  that  is,  for  explaining  the  properties  of  the  fundamental  forces,  but  that  without  knowing

reasoning  might  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  even  unwrapped  strings  have  a  minuscule  yet  nonzero
minimum mass. in a sense this is true, but the quantum-mechanical effects encountered in chapter 6—
remember the price is right, again—are able to exactly cancel this contribution to the mass. this is
how, we recall, unwrapped strings can yield the zero-mass photon, graviton, and the other massless
or near-massless particles, for example. wrapped strings are different in this regard.)

how does the existence of wrapped string configurations affect the geometrical properties of the
dimension  around  which  the  strings  wind?  the  answer,  first  recognized  in  1984  by  the  japanese
physicists keiji kikkawa and masami yamasaki, is bizarre and remarkable.

geometrical model of spacetime that plays such a pivotal role in general relativity and in string theory
is solely a convenient shorthand for the spatial and temporal relations between various locations, or
whether  we  should  view  ourselves  as  truly  being  embedded  in something  when  we  refer  to  our
immersion within the spacetime fabric.

although we are heading into speculative territory, string theory does suggest an answer to this
question. the graviton, the smallest bundle of gravitational force, is one particular pattern of string
vibration. and  just  as  an  electromagnetic  field  such  as  visible  light  is  composed  of  an  enormous
number of photons, a gravitational field is composed of an enormous number of gravitons—that is, an

enormous number of strings executing the graviton vibrational pattern. gravitational fields, in turn,
are encoded in the warping of the spacetime fabric, and hence we are led to identify the fabric of

of vibration. in the language of the field, such an enormous, organized array of similarly vibrating
strings is known as a coherent state of strings. it's a rather poetic image—the strings of string theory
as the threads of the spacetime fabric—but we should note that its rigorous meaning has yet to be
worked out completely.
