of? this is the controller; this is his fordship, mustapha mond."

clocks simultaneously struck four. discarnate voices called from the

in the lift, on their way up to the changing rooms, henry foster and 
the assistant director of predestination rather pointedly turned their 
backs on bernard marx from the psychology bureau: averted them- 
selves from that unsavoury reputation. 

the faint hum and rattle of machinery still stirred the crimson air in 
the embryo store. shifts might come and go, one lupus-coloured face 
give place to another; majestically and for ever the conveyors crept 
forward with their load of future men and women. 

lenina crowne walked briskly towards the door.

 come ..." 

the d.h.c. looked at him nervously. there were those strange rumours 
of old forbidden books hidden in a safe in the controller's study. bibles, 
poetry-ford knew what. 

mustapha mond intercepted his anxious glance and the corners of his 
red lips twitched ironically. 

"it's all right, director," he said in a tone of faint derision, "i won't cor- 
rupt them." 

the d.h.c. was overwhelmed with confusion. 

those who feel themselves despised do well to look despising. the 
smile on bernard marx's face was contemptuous. every hair on the 
bear indeed! 



"i shall make a point of going," said henry foster. 

mustapha mond leaned forward, shook a finger at them. "just try to 
realize it," he said, and his voice sent a strange thrill quivering along 
their diaphragms. "try to realize what it was like to have a viviparous 
mother."

"i can't think how it is i haven't," said the assistant predestinator. "i 
certainly will. at the first opportunity." 

from his place on the opposite side of the changing-room aisle, ber- 
nard marx overheard what they were saying and turned pale. 

"and to tell the truth," said lenina, "i'm beginning to get just a tiny bit 
bored with nothing but henry every day." she pulled on her left stock- 



ing. "do you know bernard marx?" she asked in a tone whose exces- 
sive casualness was evidently forced. 

fanny looked startled. "you don't mean to say ...?" 

"why not? bernard's an alpha plus. besides, he asked me to go to one 
of the savage reservations with him. i've always wanted to see a sav- 
age reservation." 

"but his reputation?" 

"what do i care about his reputation?" 

"they say he doesn't like obstacle golf." 

"they say, they say," mocked lenina. 

"and then he spends most of his time by himself-alone." ther

thing called liberalism. parliament, if you know what that was, passed 
a law against it. the records survive. speeches about liberty of the 
subject. liberty to be inefficient and miserable. freedom to be a round 
peg in a square hole." 



"but, my dear chap, you're welcome, i assure you. you're welcome." 
henry foster patted the assistant predestinator on the shoulder. 
"every one belongs to every one else, after all." 

one hundred repetitions three nights a week for four years, thought 
bernard marx, who was a specialist on hypnopaedia. sixty-two thou-

"or the caste system. constantly proposed, constantly rejected. there 
was something called democracy. as though men were more than 
physico-chemically equal." 

"well, all i can say is that i'm going to accept his invitation." 

bernard hated them, hated them. but they were two, they were large, 
they were strong.

"and do remember that a gramme is better than a damn." they went

down the corridor to the lift.

ere dear boys, she thought, as she returned their salutations. 
charming boys! still, she did wish that george edzel's ears weren't 
quite so big (perhaps he'd been given just a spot too much parathyroid 
at metre 328?). and looking at benito hoover, she couldn't help re- 
membering that he was really too hairy when he took his clothes off. 

turning, with eyes a little saddened by the recollection, of benito's 
curly blackness, she saw in a corner the small thin body, the melan- 
choly face of bernard marx. 

"bernard!" she stepped up to him. "i was looking for you." her voice 
rang clear above the hum of the mounting lift. the others looked 
round curiously. "i wanted to talk to you about our new mexico plan." 
out of the tail of her eye she could see benito hoover gaping with as- 
tonishment. the gape annoyed her. "surprised i shouldn't be begging 
to go with him again!" she said to herself. then aloud, and more 
warmly than ever, "i'd simply love to come with you for a week in

eighteen. go down, go ..." 

the liftman slammed the gates, touched a button and instantly 
dropped back into the droning twilight of the well, the twilight of his 
own habitual stupor. 

it was warm and bright on the roof. the summer afternoon was 
drowsy with the hum of passing helicopters; and the deeper drone of 
the rocket-planes hastening, invisible, through the bright sky five or 
six miles overhead was like a caress on the soft air. bernard marx drew 
a deep breath. he looked up into the sky and round the blue horizon 
and finally down into lenina's face. 

"isn't it beautiful!" his voice trembled a little. 

she smiled at him with an expression of the most sympathetic under- 
standing. "simply perfect for obstacle golf," she answered rapturously. 
"and now i must fly, bernard. henry gets cross if i keep him waiting. 
let me know in good time about the date." and waving her hand she 
ran away across the wide flat roof towards the hanga

propaganda by television, by feeling picture, and by syn- 
thetic voice and music respectively-twenty-two floors of them. above 
were the search laboratories and the padded rooms in which sound- 



track writers and synthetic composers did the delicate work. the top 
eighteen floors were occupied the college of emotional engineering. 

bernard landed on the roof of propaganda house and stepped out. 

"ring down to mr. helmholtz watson," he ordered the gamma-plus 
porter, "and tell him that mr. bernard marx is waiting for him on the 
roof." 

he sat down and lit a cigarette. 

helmholtz watson was writing when the message came down. 

"tell him i'm coming at once," he said and hung up the receiver. then, 
turning to his secretary, "i'll leave you to put my things away," he went 
on in the same official and impersonal tone; and, ignoring her lustrous 
smile, got up and walked briskly to the door.

"able," was the verdict of his superiors. "perhaps, (and they would 
shake their heads, would significantly lower their voices) "a little too

yes, a little too able; they were right. a mental excess had produced in 
helmholtz watson effects very similar to those which, in bernard marx, 
were the result of a physical defect. too little bone and brawn had iso- 
lated bernard from his fellow men, and the sense of this apartness, 
being, by all the current standards, a mental excess, became in its 
turn a cause of wider separation. that which had made helmholtz so 
uncomfortably aware of being himself and all alone was too much abil- 
ity. what the two men shared was the knowledge that they were indi-

odd, odd, odd, was lenina's verdict on bernard marx. so odd, in- 
deed, that in the course of the succeeding weeks she had wondered 
more than once whether she shouldn't change her mind about the new 
mexico holiday, and go instead to the north pole with benito hoover. 
the trouble was that she knew the north pole, had been there with 
george edzel only last summer, and what was more, found it pretty 
grim. nothing to do, and the hotel too hopelessly old-fashioned-no 
television laid on in the bedrooms, no scent organ, only the most pu-

there was a humming in the air. another fly trying to steal immortal

and louder, localized itself as being outside the shuttered windows. the

room, vaulted through the open window, and hurrying along the path 

between the tall agaves was in time to receive bernard marx as he
