t madness! how mad, then, i was when i
     ejected the gods on account of socrates! but o dear
     hermes, by no means be wroth with me, nor destroy me;
     but pardon me, since i have gone crazy through prating.
     and become my adviser, whether i shall bring an action
     and prosecute them, or whatever you think. you advise me
     rightly, not permitting me to get up a lawsuit, but as
     soon as possible to set fire to the house of the prating
     fellows. come hither, come hither, xanthias! come forth
     with a ladder and with a mattock and then mount upon the
     thinking-shop and dig down the roof, if you love your
     master, until you tumble the house upon them.

     [xanthias mounts upon the roof]

     but let some one bring me a lighted torch and i'll make
     some of them this day suffer punishment, even if they be
     ever so much impostors.

     1st dis. (from within) hollo! hollo!

     strep. it is your business, o torch, to send forth
     abundant flame.
