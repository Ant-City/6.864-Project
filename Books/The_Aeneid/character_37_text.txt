  so sad an object, and so well express'd,

  her mother leda's present, when she came

  selected numbers of their soldiers hide:
  with inward arms the dire machine they load,
  and iron bowels stuff the dark abode.
  in sight of troy lies tenedos, an isle

  meantime, with shouts, the trojan shepherds bring
  a captive greek, in bands, before the king;
  taken to take; who made himself their prey,
  t' impose on their belief, and troy betray;
  fix'd on his aim, and obstinately bent
  to die undaunted, or to circumvent.

  this warning in these mournful words express'd:

  troy nods from high, and totters to her fall.

  they rais'd a feeble cry, with trembling notes;
  but the weak voice deceiv'd their gasping throats.

  here priam's son, deiphobus, he found,
  whose face and limbs were one continued wound:
  dishonest, with lopp'd arms, the youth appears,
  spoil'd of his nose, and shorten'd of his ears.
  he scarcely knew him, striving to disown
  his blotted form, and blushing to be known;
  and therefore first began: "o teucer's race,
  who durst thy faultless figure thus deface?
  what heart could wish, what hand inflict, this dire disgrace?
  'twas fam'd, that in our last and fatal night

  fate and the gods, by their supreme command,
  have doom'd our ships to seek the latian land.
  to these abodes our fleet apollo sends;
  here dardanus was born, and hither tends;
  where tuscan tiber rolls with rapid force,
  and where numicus opes his holy source.
  besides, our prince presents, with his request,
  some small remains of what his sire possess'd.
  this golden charger, snatch'd from burning troy,
  anchises did in sacrifice employ;
  this royal robe and this tiara wore
  old priam, and this golden scepter bore
  in full assemblies, and in solemn games;
  these purple vests were weav'd by dardan dames."

  thus while he spoke, latinus roll'd around
  his eyes, and fix'd a while upon the ground.
  intent he seem'd, and anxious in his breast;
  not by the scepter mov'd, or kingly vest,
  but pond'ring future things of wondrous weight;
  succession, empire, and his daughter's fate.
  on these he mus'd within his thoughtful mind,
  and then revolv'd what faunus had divin'd.

  he said; and while spoke, with piercing eyes
  evander view'd the man with vast surprise,
  pleas'd with his action, ravish'd with his face:
  then answer'd briefly, with a royal grace:
  "o valiant leader of the trojan line,
  in whom the features of thy father shine,
  how i recall anchises! how i see
  his motions, mien, and all my friend, in thee!
  long tho' it be, 't is fresh within my mind,
  when priam to his sister's court design'd
  a welcome visit, with a friendly stay,
  and thro' th' arcadian kingdom took his way.
  then, past a boy, the callow down began
  to shade my chin, and call me first a man.
  i saw the shining train with vast delight,
  and priam's goodly person pleas'd my sight:
  but great anchises, far above the rest,
  with awful wonder fir'd my youthful breast.

  our mutual hearts, and plight our mutual hands.

  with these alluring words invokes his aid;
  and, that her pleasing speech his mind may move,
  inspires each accent with the charms of love:
  "while cruel fate conspir'd with grecian pow'rs,
  to level with the ground the trojan tow'rs,
  i ask'd not aid th' unhappy to restore,
  nor did the succor of thy skill implore;
  nor urg'd the labors of my lord in vain,
  a sinking empire longer to sustain,
  tho'much i ow'd to priam's house, and more
  the dangers of aeneas did deplore.
  but now, by jove's command, and fate's decree,
  his race is doom'd to reign in italy:
  with humble suit i beg thy needful art,
  o still propitious pow'r, that rules my heart!
  a mother kneels a suppliant for her son.

  to forge impenetrable shields, and grace

  "and i, whose welfare in my father lies,"
  ascanius adds, "by the great deities,
  by my dear country, by my household gods,
  by hoary vesta's rites and dark abodes,
  adjure you both, (on you my fortune stands;
  that and my faith i plight into your hands,)
  make me but happy in his safe return,
  whose wanted presence i can only mourn;
  your common gift shall two large goblets be
  of silver, wrought with curious imagery,
  and high emboss'd, which, when old priam reign'd,
  my conqu'ring sire at sack'd arisba gain'd;
  and more, two tripods cast in antic mold,
  with two great talents of the finest gold;
  beside a costly bowl, ingrav'd with art,
  which dido gave, when first she gave her heart.

  and to thy conduct my concerns in war."

  then thus the young euryalus replied:
  "whatever fortune, good or bad, betide,
  the same shall be my age, as now my youth;
  no time shall find me wanting to my truth.
  this only from your goodness let me gain
  (and, this ungranted, all rewards are vain)

  far from that hated face the trojans fly,
  all but the fool who sought his destiny.
  mad pandarus steps forth, with vengeance vow'd
  for bitias' death, and threatens thus aloud:
  "these are not ardea's walls, nor this the town
  amata proffers with lavinia's crown:
  't is hostile earth you tread. of hope bereft,
  no means of safe return by flight are left."
  to whom, with count'nance calm, and soul sedate,
  thus turnus: "then begin, and try thy fate:
  my message to the ghost of priam bear;
  tell him a new achilles sent thee there."

  a lance of tough ground ash the trojan threw,
  rough in the rind, and knotted as it grew:
  with his full force he whirl'd it first around;
  but the soft yielding air receiv'd the wound:
  imperial juno turn'd the course before,
  and fix'd the wand'ring weapon in the door.

  "but hope not thou," said turnus, "when i strike,
  to shun thy fate: our force is not alike,
  nor thy steel temper'd by the lemnian god."
