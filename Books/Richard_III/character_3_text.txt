k at me as i halt by them-
    why, i, in this weak piping time of peace,
    have no delight to pass away the time,
    unless to spy my shadow in the sun
    and descant on mine own deformity.
    and therefore, since i cannot prove a lover
    to entertain these fair well-spoken days,
    i am determined to prove a villain
    and hate the idle pleasures of these days.
    plots have i laid, inductions dangerous,
    by drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,
    to set my brother clarence and the king
    in deadly hate the one against the other;
    and if king edward be as true and just
    as i am subtle, false, and treacherous,
    this day should clarence closely be mew'd up-
    about a prophecy which says that g
    of edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
    dive, thoughts, down to my soul. here clarence comes.

             enter clarence, guarded, and brakenbury

    brother, good day. what means this armed guard
    that waits upon your grace?

. his majesty,
    tend'ring my person's safety, hath appointed
    this conduct to convey me to th' tower.
  gloucester. upon what cause?
  clarence. because my name is george.
  gloucester. alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours:
    he should, for that, commit your godfathers.
    o, belike his majesty hath some intent
    that you should be new-christ'ned in the tower.
    but what's the matter, clarence? may i know?
  clarence. yea, richard, when i know; for i protest
    as yet i do not; but, as i can learn,
    he hearkens after prophecies and dreams,
    and from the cross-row plucks the letter g,
    and says a wizard told him that by g
    his issue disinherited should be;
    and, for my name of george begins with g,
    it follows in his thought that i am he.
    these, as i learn, and such like toys as these
    hath mov'd his highness to commit me now.

    'tis not the king that sends you to the tower;
    my lady grey his wife, clarence, 'tis she
    that tempers him to this extremity.
    was it not she and that good man of worship,
    antony woodville, her brother there,
    that made him send lord hastings to the tower,
    from whence this present day he is delivered?
    we are not safe, clarence; we are not safe.
  clarence. by heaven, i think there is no man is secure
    but the queen's kindred, and night-walking heralds
    that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore.
    heard you not what an humble suppliant
    lord hastings was, for her delivery?
  gloucester. humbly complaining to her deity
    got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
    i'll tell you what-i think it is our way,
    if we will keep in favour with the king,
    to be her men and wear her livery:

    how say you, sir? can you deny all this?
  brakenbury. with this, my lord, myself have naught to do.
  gloucester. naught to do with mistress shore! i tell thee,
    fellow,
    he that doth naught with her, excepting one,
    were best to do it secretly alone.
  brakenbury. what one, my lord?
  gloucester. her husband, knave! wouldst thou betray me?
  brakenbury. i do beseech your grace to pardon me, and
    withal
    forbear your conference with the noble duke.
  clarence. we know thy charge, brakenbury, and will
    obey.
  gloucester. we are the queen's abjects and must obey.
    brother, farewell; i will unto the king;
    and whatsoe'er you will employ me in-
    were it to call king edward's widow sister-
    i will perform it to enfranchise you.
    meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
    touches me deeper than you can imagine.
  clarence. i know it pleaseth neither of us well.
  gloucester. well, your imprisonment shall not be long;

  gloucester. go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
    simple, plain clarence, i do love thee so
    that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
    if heaven will take the present at our hands.

    the king is sickly, weak, and melancholy,
    and his physicians fear him mightily.

    he cannot live, i hope, and must not die
    till george be pack'd with posthorse up to heaven.
    i'll in to urge his hatred more to clarence

    and, if i fail not in my deep intent,
    clarence hath not another day to live;
    which done, god take king edward to his mercy,
    and leave the world for me to bustle in!
    for then i'll marry warwick's youngest daughter.
    what though i kill'd her husband and her father?
    the readiest way to make the wench amends
    is to become her husband and her father;
    the which will i-not all so much for love

    and for his meed, poor lord, he is mewed up.

    was my great father-in-law, renowned warwick,
    who spake aloud 'what scourge for perjury
    can this dark monarchy afford false clarence?'
    and so he vanish'd. then came wand'ring by
    a shadow like an angel, with bright hair
    dabbled in blood, and he shriek'd out aloud
    'clarence is come-false, fleeting, perjur'd clarence,
    that stabb'd me in the field by tewksbury.

    with that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
