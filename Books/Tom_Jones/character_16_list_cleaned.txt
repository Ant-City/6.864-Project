[CHARACTER] 
 - 
                [CHARACTER] is a philosopher who lives with allworthy. he justifies his questionable 
behavior (such as making love to molly seagrim) by contorting his philosophical 
notions. [CHARACTER], although a foil to thwackum, is less sinister than the latter. 
indeed, [CHARACTER]'s virtuous transformation at the end of the novel allows 
allworthy to forgive tom.
