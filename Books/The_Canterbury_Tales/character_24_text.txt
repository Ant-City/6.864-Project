n's priest's tale


1.  the sixteen lines appended to the tale of the nun's priest
seem, as tyrwhitt observes, to commence the prologue to the
succeeding tale -- but the difficulty is to determine which that
tale should be. in earlier editions, the lines formed the opening
of the prologue to the manciple's tale; but most of the
manuscripts acknowledge themselves defective in this part, and
give the nun's tale after that of the nun's priest. in the harleian
manuscript, followed by mr wright, the second nun's tale, and
the canon's yeoman's tale, are placed after the franklin's tale;
and the sixteen lines above are not found -- the manciple's
prologue coming immediately after the "amen" of the nun's
priest. in two manuscripts, the last line of the sixteen runs thus:
"said unto the nun as ye shall hear;" and six lines more
evidently forged, are given to introduce the nun's tale.  all this
confusion and doubt only strengthen the certainty, and deepen
the regret, that "the canterbury tales" were left

act, which was passed soon after, 5 h. iv. c. iv., to make it
felony 'to multiply gold or silver, or to use the art of
multiplication.'" tyrwhitt finds in the prologue some colour
for the hypothesis that this tale was intended by chaucer to
begin the return journey from canterbury; but against this
must be set the fact that the yeoman himself expressly speaks
of the distance to canterbury yet to be ridden.

women." those who would fix that date at a
period not long before the poet's death -- who
would place the poem, indeed, among his closing
labours -- support their opinion by the fact that the
prologue recites most of chaucer's principal
works, and glances, besides, at a long array of
other productions, too many to be fully catalogued.
but, on the other hand, it is objected that the
"legend" makes no mention of "the canterbury
tales" as such; while two of those tales -- the
knight's and the second nun's -- are enumerated
by the titles which they bore as separate
compositions, before they were incorporated in the
great collection: "the love of palamon and
arcite," and "the life of saint cecile" (see note 1
to the second nun's tale). tyrwhitt seems perfectly
justified in placing the composition of the poem
immediately before that of chaucer's magnum
opus, and after the marriage of richard ii to his
first queen, anne of bohemia. that event took
place in 1382; and since it is to anne that the po
