he is. see how his crook shines as he beats the rick
with it. and his smock-frock is burnt in two holes, i
declare! a fine young shepherd he is too, ma'am."
"whose shepherd is he?" said the equestrian in a
clear voice.
"don't know, ma'am." "don't any of the others know?"
"nobody at all -- i've asked 'em. quite a stranger,
they say."
the young woman on the pony rode out from the
shade and looked anxiously around.
"do you think the barn is safe?" she said.
"d'ye think the barn is safe, jan coggan?" said
the second woman, passing on the question to the
nearest man in that direction.
"safe -now -- leastwise i think so. if this rick had
gone the barn would have followed. 'tis- that bold
shepherd up there that have done the most good -- he
sitting on the top o' rick, whizzing his great long-arms
about like a windmill."
"he does work hard." said the young woman on
horseback, looking up at gabriel through her thick
woollen veil. "i wish he was shepherd here. don't
any of you know h

, 'tis clane dirt; and we all know what that is,
as you say, and you bain't a particular man we see,
shepherd."
"true, true -- not at all." said the friendly oak.
"don't let your teeth quite meet, and you won't feel
the sandiness at all. ah! 'tis wonderful what can be
done by contrivance!"
"my own mind exactly, neighbour."
"ah, he's his grandfer's own grandson! -- his grandfer
were just such a nice unparticular man!" said the maltster.
"drink, henry fray -- drink." magnanimously said
jan coggan, a person who held saint-simonian notions
of share and share alike where liquor was concerned, as
the vessel showed signs of approaching him in its gradual
revolution among them.
having at this moment reached the end of a wistful
gaze into mid-air, henry did not refuse. he was a man
of more than middle age, with eyebrows high up in his
forehead, who laid it down that the law of the world
was bad, with a long-suffering look through his listeners
at the world alluded to, as it presented

itself to his
imagination. he always signed his name "henery" --
strenuously insisting upon that spelling, and if any
passing schoolmaster ventured to remark that the second
"e" was superfluous and old-fashioned, he received the
reply that  "h-e-n-e-r-y" was the name he was christened
and the name he would stick to -- in the tone of one
to whom orthographical differences were matters which
had a great deal to do with personal character.
mr. jan coggan, who had passed the cup to henery,
was a crimson man with a spacious countenance, and
private glimmer in his eye, whose name had appeared
on the marriage register of weatherbury and neighbour-
ing parishes as best man and chief witness in countless
unions of the previous twenty years; he also very
frequently filled the post of head godfather in baptisms
of the subtly-jovial kind.
"come, mark clark -- come. ther's plenty more

clark, who, twenty years younger than jan coggan,
revolved in the same orbit. he secreted mirth on all
occasions for special discharge at popular parties.
"why, joseph poorgrass, ye han't had a drop!" said
mr. coggan to a self-conscious man in the background,
thrusting the cup towards him.
"such a modest man as he is!" said jacob smallbury.
"why, ye've hardly had strength of eye enough to look
in our young mis'ess's face, so i hear, joseph?"
all looked at joseph poorgrass with pitying reproach.
"no -- i've hardly looked at her at al

joseph, reducing his body smaller whilst talking,
apparently from a meek sense of undue prominence.
"and when i seed her, 'twas nothing but blushes with
me!"
"poor feller." said mr. clark.
"'tis a curious nature for a man." said jan coggan.
"yes." continued joseph poorgrass -- his shyness,
which was so painful as a defect, filling him with a
mild complacency now that it was regarded as an
interesting study. "'twere blush, blush, blush with
me every minute of the time, when she was speaking
to me."
"i believe ye, joseph poorgrass, for we all know ye
to be a very bashful man."
"'tis a' awkward gift for a man, poor soul." said the
maltster. "and ye have suffered from it a long time,
we know."
"ay ever since i was a boy.

"true." said jacob smallbury, deepening his thoughts
to a profounder view of the subject. "'tis a thought
to look at, that ye might have been worse; but even
as you be, 'tis a very bad affliction for 'ee, joseph. for
ye see, shepherd, though 'tis very well for a woman,
dang it all, 'tis awkward for a man like him, poor
feller?"
"'tis -- 'tis." said gabriel, recovering from a medita-
tion. "yes, very awkward for the man."
"ay, and he's very timid, too." observed jan coggan.
"once he had been working late at yalbury bottom,
and had had a drap of drink, and lost his way as he was
coming home-along through yalbury wood, didn't ye,
master poorgrass?"
"no, no, no; not that story!" expostulated the
modest man, forcing a laugh to bury his concern.
"--  --  and so 'a lost himself quite." continued mr
coggan, with an impassive face, implying that a true
narrative, like time and tide, must run its course and
would respect no man. "and as he was coming along

charlotte, who was his dairymaid. well, a very good-

respectable young fellow was allowed to call and see

  "ay, ay, jan coggan; we know yer meaning."
  "and so you see 'twas beautiful ale, and i wished
to value his kindness as much as i could, and not to
be so ill-mannered as to drink only a thimbleful, which
would have been insulting the man's generosity  --  -- "
  "true, master coggan, 'twould so." corroborated
mark clark.

by mentioning
that the cup they were drinking out of was three years
older than he.
  while the cup was being examined, the end of
gabriel oak's flute became visible over his smock-frock
i seed you blowing into a great flute by now at caster-
bridge?"
  "you did." said gabriel, blushing faintly. "i've been
in great trouble, neighbours, and was driven to it.
take it careless-like, shepherd and your time will come
tired?"
  "neither drum nor trumpet have i heard since
christmas." said jan coggan. "come, raise a tune,
master oak!"
  "that i will." said gabriel, pulling out his flute and
putting it together. "a poor tool, neighbours; but
such as i can do ye shall have and welcome."
  oak then struck up "jockey to the fair." and played
that sparkling melody three times through accenting the
notes in the third round in a most artistic and lively
manner by bending his body in small jerks and tapping
with his foot to beat time.
  "he can blow the flute very well -- that 'a can." sa

  "new lords new laws, as the saying is, i suppose,"
remarked coggan.
  "ay, 'a b'lieve -- ha, ha!" said susan tall's husband,
in a tone intended to imply his habitual reception of
jokes without minding them at all.   the young man
then wished them good-night and withdrew.
  henery fray was the first to follow. then gabriel
arose and went off with jan coggan, who had offered
him a lodging. a few minutes later, when the remaining
ones were on their legs and about to depart, fray came
back again in a hurry. flourishing his finger ominously
he threw a gaze teeming with tidings just -- where his eye
alighted by accident, which happened to be in joseph
poorgrass's face.
  "o -- what's the matter, what's the matter, henery?"
said joseph, starting back.
  "what's a-brewing, henrey?" asked jacob and mark
clark.

from the recesses of this knot of foliage the loud
notes of three cuckoos were resounding through the
still air.
boldwood went meditating down the slopes with his
eyes on his boots, which the yellow pollen from the
buttercups had bronzed in artistic gradations. a tribu-
tary of the main stream flowed through the basin of the
pool by an inlet and outlet at opposite points of its
diameter. shepherd oak, jan coggan, moon, poor-
grass, cain ball, and several others were assembled
here, all dripping wet to the very roots of their hair,
and bathsheba was standing by in a new riding-habit --
the most elegant she had ever worn -- the reins of her
horse being looped over her arm. flagons of cider
were rolling about upon the green. the meek sheep
were pushed into the pool by coggan and matthew
moon, who stood by the lower hatch, immersed to their
waists; then gabriel, who stood on the brink, thrust

like bishops' croziers, the square-headed moschatel, the
odd cuckoo-pint, -- like an apoplectic saint in a niche
of malachite, -- snow-white ladies'-smocks, the toothwort,
approximating to human flesh, the enchanter's night-
shade, and the black-petaled doleful-bells, were among
the quainter objects of the vegetable world in and about
weatherbury at this teeming time; and of the animal,
the metamorphosed figures of mr. jan coggan, the
master-shearer; the second and third shearers, who
travelled in the exercise of their calling, and do not re-

shearer, susan tall's husband the fifth, joseph poorgrass
the sixth, young cain ball as assistant-shearer, and
gabriel oak as general supervisor. none of these were
clothed to any extent worth mentioning, each appearing
to have hit in the matter of raiment the decent mean
between a high and low caste hindoo. an angularity

it was the unvaying custom in weatherbury to
sink minor differences when the maltster had to be
pacified.
"weak as-water! yes." said jan coggan.- "malter,
we feel ye to be a wonderful veteran man, and nobody
can gainsay it."
"nobody." said joseph poorgrass. "ye be a very
rare old  spectacle, malter, and we all admire ye for that
gift. "
"ay, and as a young man, when my senses were in
prosperity, i was likewise liked by a good-few who
knowed me." said the maltster.

me for one -- a excellent time." said joseph
poorgrass, straightening his back; for he, like some of
the others, had a way of resting a while from his labour
on such hot days for reasons preternaturally small; of
which cain pall's advent on a week-day in his sunday-
clothes was one of the first magnitude. "twas a bad leg
allowed me to read the pilgrim's progress, and mark
clark learnt alifours in a whitlow."
"ay, and my father put his arm out of joint to have
time to go courting." said jan coggan, in an eclipsing
tone, wiping his face with his shirt-sleeve and thrusting
back his hat upon the nape of his neck.
by this time cainy was nearing the group of harvesters,
and was perceived to be carrying a large slice of bread
and ham in one hand, from which he took mouthfuls
as he ran, the other being wrapped in a bandage.
when he came close, his mouth assumed the bell shape,
and he began to cough violently.
   "now, cainy!" said gabriel, sternly.  "how many
more times must i tell yo

narrative at this point simultaneously with his loss of
breath, their informant looked up and down the field
apparently for some clue to it. "well, i see our mis'ess
and a soldier -- a-ha-a-wk!"
"damn the boy!" said gabriel.
"'tis only my manner, mister oak, if ye'll excuse it,"
said cain ball, looking reproachfully at oak, with eyes
drenched in their own dew.
!here's some cider for him -- that'll cure his throat,"
said jan coggan, lifting a flagon of cider, pulling out
the cork, and applying the hole to cainy's mouth;
joseph poorgrass in the meantime beginning to think
apprehensively of the serious consequences that would
follow cainy ball's strangulation in his cough, and the
history of his bath adventures dying with him.
"for my poor self, i always say "please god" afore
i do anything." said joseph, in an unboastful voice; "and
so should you, cain ball. "'tis a great safeguard, and

as soon as the tent was completed the band struck
up highly stimulating harmonies, and the announce-
ment was publicly made, black bess standing in a con-
spicuous position on the outside, as a living proof, if
proof were wanted, of the truth of the oracular utterances
from the stage over which the people were to enter.
these were so convinced by such genuine appeals to
heart and understanding both that they soon began to
crowd in abundantly, among the foremost being visible
jan coggan and joseph poorgrass, who were holiday
keeping here to-day,
"'that's the great ruffen pushing me!" screamed a
woman in front of jan over her shoulder at him when
the rush was at its fiercest.
"how can i help pushing ye when the folk behind
push me?" said coggan, in a deprecating tone, turning
without turning his body, which was jammed as in a vice.
there was a silence; then the drums and trumpets
again sent forth their echoing notes. the crowd was
again ecstasied, and gave another lur
