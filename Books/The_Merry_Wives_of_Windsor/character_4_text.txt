 stated month.  a
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  to be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.

we produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  the
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  this
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  if our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
files per month, or 432 more etex

why is this "small print!" statement here?  you know: lawyers.
they tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  so, among other things, this "small print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  it also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to

ere may
be differences (other than what i have mentioned above) between
this and other first folio editions.  this is due to the printer's
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run.  the proof run wasn't thrown away but
incorporated into the printed copies.  this is just the way it is.
the text i have used was a composite of more than 30 different
first folio editions' best pages.

if you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation
errors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
free to email me those errors.  i wish to make this the best
etext possible.  my email address for right now are haradda@aol.com
and davidr@inconnect.com.  i hope that you enjoy this.
