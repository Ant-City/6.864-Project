Polynices - 
                	Son
of Oedipus, and thus also his brother. Polynices appears only very
briefly in Oedipus at Colonus. He arrives at Colonus
seeking his father's blessing in his battle with his brother, Eteocles,
for power in Thebes. Polynices tries to point out the similarity
between his own situation and that of Oedipus, but his words seem opportunistic
rather than filial, a fact that Oedipus points out.
