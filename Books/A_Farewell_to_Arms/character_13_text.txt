had thick full lips and black eyes. 

i stopped the car and went over and spoke to the ma- 
tron. the girls from the officers' house had left early 
that morning, she said. where were they going? to 
conegliano, she said. the truck started. the girl with 
thick lips put out her tongue again at us. the matron 
waved. the two girls kept on crying. the others 
looked interestedly out at the town. i got back in the 
car. 

"we ought to go with them," bonello said. "that 
would be a good trip." 

"we'll have a good trip," i said. 

"we'll have a hell of a trip." 

"that's what i mean," i said. we came up the drive 
to the villa.

"i'd like to be there when some of those tough ba- 
bies climb in and try and hop them. ,, 

"you think they will?" 

"sure. everybody in the second army knows that 
matron." 

we were outside the villa. 

"they call her the mother superior," bonello said.

other two cars came in while i was there and their driv- 
ers got down. it was starting to rain again. 

"i'm so sleepy i went to sleep three times com- 
ing here from plava," piani said. "what are we going 
to do, tenente?" 

"we'll change the oil, grease them, fill them up, then 
take them around in front and load up the junk they've 
left." 

"then do we start?" 

"no, we'll sleep for three hours." 



202 a farewell to arms 

"christ i'm glad to sleep/' bonello said. "i couldn't 
keep awake driving." 

"how's your car, aymo ?" i asked. 

"it's all right." 

"get me a monkey suit and i'll help you with the 
oil." 

"don't you do that, tenente," aymo said. "it's 
nothing to do. you go and pack your things." 

"my things are all packed," i said. "i'll go and 
carry out the stuff that they left for us. bring the 
cars around as soon as they're ready." 

they brought the cars around to the front of the 
villa and we loaded them with the hospital equipment

which was piled in the hallway. when it was all in, 
the three cars stood in line down the driveway under the 
trees in the rain. we went inside. 

"make a fire in the kitchen and dry your things," i 
said. 

"i don't care about dry clothes," piani said. "i want 
to sleep." 

"i'm going to sleep on the major's bed," bonello 
said. "i'm going to sleep where the old man corks off." 

"i don't care where i sleep," piani said. 

"there are two beds in here." i opened the door. 

"i never knew what was in that room," bonello said. 

"that was old fish-face's room," piani said. 

"you two sleep in there," i said. "i'll wake you." 

"the austrians will wake us if you sleep too long, 
tenente," bonello said. 

"i won't oversleep," i said. "where's aymo?" 

"he went out in the kitchen." 

"get to sleep," i said. 

"i'll sl

all day. the whole top of my head kept coming down 
over my eyes." 

"take your boots off," bonello said. "that's old 
fish-face's bed." 

"fish-face is nothing to me." piani lay on the bed, 
his muddy boots straight out, his head on his arm. i 
went out to the kitchen. aymo had a fire in the stove 
and a kettle of water on. 

"i thought i'd start some pasta asciutta" he said. 
"we'll be hungry when we wake up." 

"aren't you sleepy, bartolomeo?" 

"not so sleepy. when the water boils i'll leave it. 
the fire will go down." 

"you'd better get some sleep," i said. "we can eat

 trees were dripping in the rain. it was cold and 
the drops hung to the branches. i went back to ri- 
naldi's bed and lay down and let sleep take me. 

we ate in the kitchen before we started. aymo had 
a basin of spaghetti with onions and tinned meat 
chopped up in it. we sat around the table and drank 
two bottles of the wine that had been left in the cellar 
of the villa. it was dark outside and still raining. 
piani sat at the table very sleepy. 

"i like a retreat better than an advance," bonello 
said. "on a retreat we drink barbera." 

"we drink it now. to-morrow maybe we drink rain- 
water," aymo said. 

"to-morrow we'll be in udine. we'll drink cham- 
pagne. that's where the slackers live. wake up, piani ! 
we'll drink champagne to-morrow in udine !" 

"i'm awake," piani said. he filled his plate with the 
spaghetti and meat. "couldn't you find tomato sauce, 
barto?" 

"there wasn't any," aymo said. 

"we'll drink champagne in udine," bonello said. 
he filled his glass with the clea

"we may drink before udine," piani said. 

"have you eaten enough, tenente?" aymo asked. 

"i've got plenty. give me the bottle, bartolomeo." 

"i have a bottle apiece to take in the cars," aymo 
said. 

"did you sleep at all ?" 

"i don't need much sleep. i slept a little." 

"to-morrow we'll sleep in the king's bed," bonello 
said. he was feeling very good. 

"to-morrow maybe we'll sleep in ," piani said. 

"i'll sleep with the queen," bonello said. he looked 
to see how i took the joke. 



a farewell to arms 205 

"you'll sleep with ," piani said sleepily. 

"that's treason, tenente, ,, bonello said. "isn't that 
treason?" 

"shut up," i said. "you get too funny with a little 
wine." outside it was raining hard. i looked at my 
watch. it was half -past nine. 

"it's time to roll," i said and stood up. 

"who are you going to ride with, tenente?" bo- 
nello asked. 

"with aymo. then you come. then piani. we'll 
start out on the road

"i'm afraid i'll go to sleep," piani said. 

"all right. i'll ride with you. then bonello. then 
aymo." 

"that's the best way," piani said. "because i'm so 
sleepy." 

"i'll drive and you sleep awhile." 

"no. i can drive just so long as i know somebody 
will wake me up if i go to sleep." 

"i'll wake you up. put out the lights, barto." 

"you might as well leave them," bonello said. 
"we've got no more use for this place." 

"i have a small locker trunk in my room," i said. 
"will you help take it down, piani ?" 

"we'll take it," piani said. "come on, aldo." he 
went off into the hall with bonello. i heard them go- 
ing upstairs. 

"this was a fine place," bartolomeo aymo said. he 
put two bottles of wine and half a cheese into his haver- 
sack. "there won't be a place like this again. where 
will they retreat to, tenente?"

piani was asleep over the wheel. i climbed up beside 
him and went to sleep too. several hours later i heard 
the truck ahead of us grinding into gear. i woke piani

start. i got down and went back to see aymo and 
bonello. bonello had two sergeants of engineers on 
the seat of his car with him. they stiffened when i 
came up. 

"they were left to do something to a bridge," bo- 
nello said. "they can't find their unit so i gave them a 
ride." 

"with the sir lieutenant's permission/' 

"with permission," i said. 

"the lieutenant is an american," bonello said. 
"he'll give anybody a ride." 

one of the sergeants smiled. the other asked bo- 
nello if i was an italian from north or south america.

was needed was for a few men to leave their trucks or 
a few horses be killed to tie up completely the move- 
ment on the road. 

the rain was not falling so heavily now and i 
thought it might clear. i went ahead along the edge of 
the road and when there was a small road that led off 
to the north between two fields with a hedge of trees 
on both sides, i thought that we had better take it and 
hurried back to the cars. i told piani to turn off and 
went back to tell bonello and aymo. 

"if it leads nowhere we can turn around and cut back 
in," i said. 

"what about these?" bonello asked. his two ser- 
geants were beside him on the seat. they were un- 
shaven but still military looking in the early morning. 

"they'll be good to push," i said. i went back to

aymo and told him we were going to try it across 
country. 

"what about my virgin family ?" aymo asked. the 
two girls were asleep. 

"they won't be very useful," i said. "you ough

"bersaglieri," aymo smiled. "they have the widest 
backs. they measure them. how do you feel, ten- 
ente?" 

"fine. how are you?" 

"fine. but very hungry." 

"there ought to be something up that road and we 
will stop and eat." 

"how's your leg, tenente?" 

"fine," i said. standing on the step and looking up 
ahead i could see piani's car pulling out onto the little 
side-road and starting up it, his car showing through 
the hedge of bare branches. bonello turned off and 
followed him and then piani worked his way out and 
we followed the two ambulances ahead along the nar- 
row road between hedges. it led to a farmhouse. we 
found piani and bonello stopped in the farmyard. the 
house was low and long with a trellis with a grape-vine 
over the door. there was a well in the yard and piani 
was getting up water to fill his radiator. so much go- 
ing in low gear had boiled it out. the farmhouse was 
deserted. i looked back down the road, the farmhou

 through the house. the girls were awake and look- 
ing at the courtyard, the well and the two big ambu- 
lances in front of the farmhouse, with three drivers at 
the well. one of the sergeants came out with a clock 
in his hand. 

'tut it back," i said. he looked at me, went in the 
house and came back without the clock. 

" where's your partner?" i asked. 

"he's gone to the latrine." he got up on the seat of 
the ambulance. he was afraid we would leave him. 

"what about breakfast, tenente?" bonello asked. 
"we could eat something. it wouldn't take very long." 

"do you think this road going down on the other 
side will lead to anything?" 

"sure." 

"all right. let's eat." piani and bonello went in 
the house. 

"come on," aymo said to the girls. he held his 
hand to help them down. the older sister shook her 
hecid. they were not going into any deserted house. 
they looked after us. 

"they are difficult," aymo said. we went into the 
farmhouse together. it was large and dark, an aban-

"there's not much to eat," piani said. "they've 
cleaned it out." 

bonello sliced a big white cheese on the heavy kitchen 
table. 

"where was the cheese?" 

"in the cellar. piani found wine too and apples." 

"that's a good breakfast." 

piani was taking the wooden cork out of a big wick-

pan full. 

"it smells all right," he said. "find some beakers,

the two sergeants came in. 

"have some cheese, sergeants," bonello said. 

"we should go," one of the sergeants said, eatin

cheese and drinking a cup of wine. 

"we'll go. don't worry," bonello said. 

"an army travels on its stomach," i said. 

"what?" asked the sergeant. 

"it's better to eat." 

"yes. but time is precious." 

"i believe the bastards have eaten already," piani 
said. the sergeants looked at him. they hated the lot 
of us. 

"you know the road?" one of them asked me. 

"no," i said. they looked at each other. 

"we would do best to start," the first one said. 

"we are starting," i said. i drank another cup of 
the red wine. it tasted very good after the cheese and

apple. 

"bring the cheese," i said and went out. bonello 
came out carrying the great jug of wine. 

"that's too big," i said. he looked at it regretfully. 

"i guess it is," he said. "give me the canteens to 
fill." he filled the canteens and some of the wine ran 
out on the stone paving of the courtyard. then he 
picked up the wine jug and put it just inside the door. 

"the austrians can find it without breaking the door 
down," he said. 

"we'll roll," i said. "piani and i will go ahead." 
the two engineers were already on the seat beside bo-

r. i opened up my holster, took 
the pistol, aimed at the one who had talked the most, 
and fired. i missed and they both started to run. i 
shot three times and dropped one. the other went 
through the hedge and was out of sight. i fired at him 
through the hedge as he ran across the field. the pistol 
clicked empty and i put in another clip. i saw it was 
too far to shoot at the second sergeant. he was far 
across the field, running, his head held low. i com- 
menced to reload the empty clip. bonello came up. 

"let me go finish him," he said. i handed him the 
pistol and he walked down to where the sergeant of 
engineers lay face down across the road. bonello leaned 
over, put the pistol against the man's head and pulled 
the trigger. the pistol did not fire. 

"you have to cock it," i said. he cocked it and 
fired twice. he took hold of the sergeant's legs and 
pulled him to the side of the road so he lay beside the 
hedge. he came back and handed me the pistol. 

"the son of a bitch," he

 said. he looked toward 
the sergeant. "you see me shoot him, tenente?" 

"we've got to get the brush quickly," i said. "did 
i hit the other one at all?" 

"i don't think so," aymo said. "he was too far 
away to hit with a pistol." 

"the dirty scum," piani said. we were all cutting 
twigs and branches. everything had been taken out 
of the car. bonello was digging out in front of the 
wheels. when we were ready aymo started the car 
and put it into gear. the wheels spun round throwing 
brush and mud. bonello and i pushed until we could 
feel our joints crack. the car would not move. 



a farewell to arms 219 

"rock her back and forth, barto," i said. 

he drove the engine in reverse, then forward. the 
wheels only dug in deeper. then the car was resting 
on the differential again, and the wheels spun freely in 
the holes they had dug. i str

"we'll try her with a rope," i said. 

"i don't think it's any use, tenente. you can't get 
a straight pull. ,, 

"we have to try it," i said. "she won't come out 
any other way." 

piani's and bonello's cars could only move straight 
ahead down the narrow road. we roped both cars to- 
gether and pulled. the wheels only pulled sideways 
against the ruts. 

"it's no good," i shouted. "stop it." 

piani and bonello got down from their cars and 
came back. aymo got down. the girls were up the road 
about forty yards sitting on a stone wall. 

"what do you say, tenente?" bonello asked. 

"we'll dig out and try once more with the brush," 
i said. i looked down the road. it was my fault i 
had led them up here. the sun was almost out from 
behind the clouds and the body of the sergeant lay be- 
side the hedge. 

"we'll put his coat and cape under," i said. bonello 
went to get them. i cut brush and aymo and p

dug out in front and between the wheels. i cut the 
cape, then ripped it in two, and laid it under the wheel 
in the mud, then piled brush for the wheels to catch. 
we were ready to start and aymo got up on the seat 
and started the car. the wheels spun and we pushed 
and pushed. but it wasn't any use. 

"it's ed," i said. "is there anything you want 

in the ear, barto?" 



220 a farewell to arms 

aymo climbed up with bonello, carrying the cheese 
and two bottles of wine and his cape. bonello, sitting 
behind the wheel, was looking through the pockets of 
the sergeant's coat. 

"better throw the coat away," i said. "what about 
barto's virgins ?" 

"they can get in the back," piani said. "i don't 
think we are going far." 

i opened the back door of the ambulance. 

"come on," i said. "get in." the two girls climbed 
in and sat in the corner. they seemed to have taken no 
notice of the shooting. i looked back up the road. the 
sergeant lay in his dirty long-sleeved underwear. i 
got

 out my pocket-book and gave them 
each a ten-lira note. "go down there," i said, pointing. 
"friends! family!" 

they did not understand but they held the money 
tightly and started down the road. they looked back 
as though they were afraid i might take the money 
back. i watched them go down the road, their shawls 
close around them, looking back apprehensively at us. 
the three drivers were laughing. 



a farewell to arms 221 

"how much will you give me to go in that direction, 
tenente?" bonello asked. 

"they're better off in a bunch of people than alone 
if they catch them/' i said. 

"give me two hundred lire and i'll walk straight 
back toward austria," bonello said. 

"they'd take it away from you," piani said. 

"maybe the war will be over," aymo said. we were 
going up the road as fast as we could. the sun was 
trying to come through. beside the road were mul- 
berry trees. through the trees i could see our two big 
moving-vans of cars stuck in the field. piani looked 
back too.

"they'll have to build a road to get them out," he 
said. 

"i wish to christ we had bicycles," bonello said. 

"do they ride bicycles in america?" aymo asked. 

"they used to." 

"here it is a great thing," aymo said. "a bicycle is 
a splendid thing." 

"i wish to christ we had bicycles," bonello said. "i'm 
no walker." 

"is that firing?" i asked. i thought i could hear 
firing a long way away. 

"i don't know," aymo said. he listened. 

"i think so," i said. 

"the first thing we will see will be the cavalry," 
piani said. 

"i don't think they've got any cavalry." 

"i hope to christ not," bonello said. "i don't want 
to be stuck on a lance by any cavalry." 

"you certainly shot that sergeant, tenente," piani 
said. we were walking fast. 

"i killed him," bonello said. "i never kille

"you killed him on the sit all right," piani said. 
"he wasn't flying very fast when you killed him." 

"never mind. that's one thing i can always remem- 
ber. i killed that of a sergeant." 

"what will you say in confession?" aymo asked. 

"i'll say, 'bless me, father, i killed a sergeant/ " they 
all laughed. 

"he's an anarchist," piani said. "he doesn't go to 
church." 

"piani's an anarchist too," bonello said. 

"are you really anarchists?" i asked. 

"no, tenente. we're socialists. we come from 
imola." 

"haven't you ever been there?" 

"no." 

"by christ it's a fine place, tenente. you come 
there after the war and we'll show you something." 

"are you all socialists?" 

"everybody." 

"is it a fine town?" 

"wonderful. you never saw a town like that." 

"how did you get to be socialists?"

we've always been socialists."

nd muddy. we did not see any troops; only aban- 
doned trucks and stores. along the river bank there 
was nothing and no one but the wet brush and muddy 
ground. we went up to the bank and finally we saw 
the railway bridge. 

"what a beautiful bridge/' aymo said. it was a 
long plain iron bridge across what was usually a dry 
river-bed. 

"we better hurry and get across before they blow it 
up," i said. 

"there's nobody to blow it up," piani said. "they're 
all gone." 

"it's probably mined," bonello said. "you cross 
first, tenente." 

"listen to the anarchist," aymo said. "make him 
go first." 

"hi go," i said. "it won't be mined to blow up with 
one man." 

"you see," piani said. "that is brains. why 
haven't you brains, anarchist?" 

223 



224 a farewell to arms 

"if i had brains i wouldn't be here," bonello said. 

"that's pretty good, tenente," aymo said. 

"that's pretty good," i said. we were close to the 
bridge now. the sky had clouded over again and it 
was raining a little.

"a german staff car crossed on the upper bridge." 

"a staff car?" 

"yes." 

"holy mary." 

the others came and we all crouched in the mud be- 
hind the embankment, looking across the rails at the 
bridge, the line of trees, the ditch and the road. 

"do you think we're cut off then, tenente?" 

"i don't know. all i know is a german staff car 
went along that road." 



a farewell to arms 225 

"you don't feel funny, tenente? you haven't got 
strange feelings in the head?" 

"don't be funny, bonello. ,, 

"what about a drink ?" piani asked. "if we're cut 
off we might as well have a drink." he unhooked his 
canteen and uncorked it. 

"look! look!" aymo said and pointed toward the 
road. along the top of the stone bridge we could see 
german helmets moving. they were bent forward and 
moved smoothly, almost supernaturally, along. as 
they came off the bridge we saw them. they were 
bicycle troops. i saw the faces of the first two. they 
were ruddy and healthy-looking. their helmets came

they did not talk but we could not have heard them 
because of the noise from the river. they were gone 
out of sight up the road. 

"holy mary," aymo said. 

"they were germans," piani said. "those weren't 
austrians." 

"why isn't there somebody here to stop them?" i 
said. "why haven't they blown the bridge up? why 
aren't there machine-guns along this embankment?" 

"you tell us, tenente," bonello said. 

i was very angry. 

"the whole bloody thing is crazy. down below they 
blow up a little bridge. here they leave a bridge on 
the main road. where is everybody? don't they try 
and stop them at all?" 



226 a farewell to arms 

"you tell us, tenente," bonello said. i shut up. it 
was none of my business ; all i had to do was to get to 
pordenone with three ambulances. i had failed at that. 
all i had to do now was get to pordenone. i prob- 
ably could not even get to udine. the hell i c

the thing to do was to be calm and not get shot or 
captured. 

"didn't you have a canteen open?" i asked piani. 
he handed it to me. i took a long drink. "we might 
as well start," i said. "there's no hurry though. do 
you want to eat something?" 

"this is no place to stay," bonello said. 

"all right. we'll start." 

"should we keep on this side — out of sight?" 

"we'll be better off on top. they may come along 
this bridge too. we don't want them on top of us 
before we see them." 

we walked along the railroad track. on both sides 
of us stretched the wet plain. ahead across the plain 
was the hill of udine. the roofs fell away from the 
castle on the hill. we could see the campanile and the 
clock-tower. there were many mulberry trees in the 
fields. ahead i saw a p

up. the ties had been dug out too and thrown down 
the embankment. 

"down! down!" aymo said. we dropped down be- 
side the embankment. there was another group of 
bicyclists passing along the road. i looked over the 
edge and saw them go on. 

"they saw us but they went on," aymo said. 

"we'll get killed up there, tenente," bonello said. 

"they don't want us," i said. "they're after some- 
thing else. we're in more danger if they should come 
on us suddenly." 



a farewell to arms 227 

"i'd rather walk here out of sight," bonello said. 

"all right. we'll walk along the tracks." 

"do you think we can get through?" aymo asked. 

"sure. there aren't very many of them yet. we'll 
go through in the dark." 

"what was that staff car doing?"

back of the neck and the bullet had ranged upward and

wiped at his face, with a piece of the emergency dress- 
ing, then let it alone. 

"the ," he said. 

"they weren't germans," i said. "there can't be 
any germans over there." 

"italians," piani said, using the word as an epithet, 
"italiani!" bonello said nothing. he was sitting be- 
side aymo, not looking at him. piani picked up aymo's 
cap where it had rolled down the embankment and put 
it over his face. he took out his canteen. 

"do you want a drink?" piani handed bonello the 
canteen. 

"no," bonello said. he turned to me. "that might 
have happened to us any time on the railway tracks." 

"no," i said. "it was because we started across the 
field." 

bonello shook his head. "aymo's dead," he said. 
"who's dead next, tenente? where do

 we go now?" 

"those were italians that shot," i said. "they 
weren't germans." 

"i suppose if they were germans they'd have killed 
all of us," bonello said.

"we are in more danger from italians than ger- 
mans/' i said. "the rear guard are afraid of every- 
thing. the germans know what they're after." 

"you reason it out, tenente," bonello said. 

"where do we go now?" piani asked. 

"we better lie up some place till it's dark. if we 
could get south we'd be all right." 

"they'd have to shoot us all to prove they were right 
the first time," bonello said. "i'm not going to try 
them." 

"we'll find a place to lie up as near to udine as we 
can get and then go through when it's dark." 

"let's go then," bonello said. we went down the 
north side of the embankment i looked back. ay mo 
lay in the mud with the angle of the embankme

from the farmhouse itself. i walked toward it, seeing 
it very clearly. the balcony of the second floor merged 
into the barn and there was hay coming out between 
the columns. the courtyard was of stone blocks and 
all the trees were dripping with the rain. there was a

big empty two- wheeled cart, the shafts tipped high up 
in the rain. i came to the courtyard, crossed it, and 
stood under the shelter of the balcony. the door of the 
house was open and i went in. bonello and piani came 
in after me. it was dark inside. i went back to the 
kitchen. there were ashes of a fire on the big open 
hearth. the pots hung over the ashes, but they were 
empty. i looked around but i could not find anything 
to eat. 

"we ought to lie up in the barn," i said. "do you 
think you could find anything to eat, piani, and bring 
it up there ?" 

'til look," piani said. 

'til look too," bonello said. 

"all right, ,, i said. 'til go up and look at the 
barn." i found a stone stai

here was no shelling. 
that was something. they must have gotten some 
troops along the road. i looked down in the half-light 
of the hay-barn and saw piani standing on the hauling

floor. he had a long sausage, a jar of something and 
two bottles of wine under his arm. 

"come up," i said. "there is the ladder." then i 
realized that i should help him with the things and 
went down. i was vague in the head from lying in the 
hay. i had been nearly asleep. 

"where's bonello?" i asked. 

"i'll tell you," piani said. we went up the ladder. 
up on the hay we set the things down. piani took out 
his knife with the corkscrew and drew the cork on a 
wine bottle. 

"they have sealing-wax on it," he said. "it must be 
good." he smiled. 

"where's bonello?" i asked. 

piani looked at me. 

"he went away, tenente," he said. "he wanted to 
be a prisoner." 

i did not say anything. 

"he was afraid we would get killed." 

i held the bottle of wine and did not say anything.

to the north. we were 
very close to germans twice in the rain but they did 
not see us. we got past the town to the north without 
seeing any italians, then after a while came on the 
main channels of the retreat and walked all night 
toward the tagliamento. i had not realized how gigan- 
tic the retreat was. the whole country was moving, as 
well as the army. we walked all night, making better 
time than the vehicles. my leg ached and i was tired 
but we made good time. it seemed so silly for bonello 
to have decided to be taken prisoner. there was no 
danger. we had walked through two armies without 
incident. if aymo had not been killed there would 
never have seemed to be any danger. no one had

bothered us when we were in plain sight along the rail- 
way. the killing came suddenly and unreasonably. i 
wondered where bonello was. 

"how do you feel, tenente? ,, piani asked. we were 
going along the side of a road crowded with vehicles 
and troops. 

"fine."

"i'm tired of this walking/' 

"well, all we have to do is walk now. we don't have 
to worry." 

"bonello was a fool." 

"he was a fool all right." 

"what will you do about him, tenente?" 

"i don't know." 

"can't you just put him down as taken prisoner?" 

"i don't know." 

"you see if the war went on they would make bad 
trouble for his family." 

"the war won't go on," a soldier said. "we're 
going home. the war is over." 

"everybody's going home." 

"we're all going home." 

"come on, tenente," piani said. he wanted to get 
past them. 

"tenente? who's a tenente? a basso gli ufficiali!

will 
go on." 

"the germans could come on," i said. "i wonder 
why they don't come on." 

"i don't know. i don't know anything about this 
kind of war." 

"they have to wait for their transport i suppose." 

"i don't know," piani said. alone he was much 
gentler. when he was with the others he was a very 
rough talker. 

"are you married, luigi?" 

"you know i am married." 

"is that why you did not want to be a prisoner?" 

"that is one reason. are you married, tenente?" 

"no." 

"neither is bonello." 

"you can't tell anything by a man's being married. 
but i should think a married man would want to get 
back to his wife," i said. i would be glad to talk about 
wives. 

"yes." 

"how are your feet?" 

"they're sore enough." 

before daylight we reached the bank of the taglia- 
mento and followed down along the flooded river to the 
bridge where all the traffic was crossing. 

"they ought to be able to hold at this river," piani 
said. in the dark the flood looked high. the water 
swirled
