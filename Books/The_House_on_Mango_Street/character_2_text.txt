there and dance before she gets old.

sally  i!!  the  girl  with  eyes  like  egypt  and  nylons  the 
color of smoke.  the  boys  at school  think  she's  beautiful 
because her hair is shiny black like raven feathers and when
she laughs, she flicks  her hair back  like  a satin  shawl  over 
her shoulders and laughs. 

her  father  says  to  be  this  beautiful  is  trouble.  they 
are  very  strict  in  his  religion.  they  are  not  supposed  to 
dance.  he remembers his sisters and is sad. then she can't 
go  oul.  sally

trees and more trees and plenty of blue sky. and you could 
laugh, sally. you could go to sleep and wake up and never 
have  to  think  who  likes  and  doesn't  like  you.  you  could 
close your eyes and you wouldn't have to worry what people 
said because' you never belonged here anyway and nobody 
could make you sad and nobody would think you're strange 
because you  like to dream and dream. and no one could 
yell at you if they saw  you out in the dark leaning against 
a car, leaning against somebody without someone thinking 
you are bad, without somebody sayin

sally was going to get permission to stay with us a little 
and  one  thursday  she  came  finally  with  a  sack  full  of 
clothes and a paper bag of sweetbread her mama sent. and 
would've stayed too except when the dark came her father, 
whose  eyes  were  little  from  crying,  knocked  on  the door 
and said  please  come  back,  this  is  the  last  time.  and  she 
said  daddy and went home. 

then we  didn't need  to worry.  until  one day sally's 
father  catches  her talking  to  a  boy  a

what sally said 

he never hits me hard. she said  her mama rubs lard
 
on all  the  places where it  hurts. then at  school  she'd  say
 
she fell. that's where all  the blue places come from. that's
 
why  her skin  is  always  scarred.
 

but who believes her. a girl that big, a girl who comes
 
in  with  her pretty face all  beaten and black can't be falling
 
off the stairs.  he never hits  me hard.
 

but sally doesn't tell  about that time he  hit  her with
 
his  hands just like a dog, she said, l

this is  where i  wanted to die and where i  tried one 
day  but  not even the  monkey  garden would  have  me.  it 
was  the last day  i  would go there. 

who was it that said i  was getting too old to play the 
games? who was it i didn't listen to? i only remember that 
when  the  others  ran,  i  wanted  to  run  too,  up and down 
and through the monkey garden, fast as the boys, not like 
sally  who screamed if she got her stockings muddy. 

i  said,  sally,  come on,  but she  wouldn't.  she stayed 
by  the curb talking to tito and his  friends.  play  with  the 
kids  if you want,  she said,  i'm staying here. she could be 
stuck-up like  that if she wanted to,  so i just left. 

i t  was  her own fault  too.  when i  got back sally  was 
pretending to be mad ... something about the boys having 
stolen  her  keys.  please  give  them  back  to  me,  she  said 
punching the nearest o

ne with a soft fist. they were laugh­
ing.  she was  too.  it was a joke i  didn't get. 

i wanted to go back with the other kids who were still 

jumping on cars, still chasing each other through the gar­
den, but sally  had her own game. 

one  of the  boys  invented  the  rules.  one  of tito's 
friends  said you can't get the keys back unless you  kiss  us 
and sally  pretended to be  mad at first  but she said yes.  it 
was  that simple. 

i  don't know  why,  but something inside  me  wanted 
to  throw  a  stick.  something  wanted  to  say  no  when  i 
watched sally going into the garden with tito's buddies all 

grinning. it was just a  kiss,  that's all.  a  li.ss  for each  0de­
s<>  what, she said, 

only  how  come  i  felt  angry  inside.  like  something 
wasn't right. sally went behind that old blue pickup to usa 
the boys and get her keys back

, and i  ran up three flights 
of stairs to where tito lived. his mother was ironing shirts. 
she was sprinkling water on them from an empty pop botde 
and smoking a cigarette. 

your son and  his  friends  stole  sally's  keys  and  now 
they won't give  them back unles she kisses them and right 
now  they're making her kiss  them, i said all out of breath 
from the three flights  of stairs. 

those kids, she said, not looking up from her ironing.
 
that's all?
 
what do you  want me to do, she said, call  the cops?
 

and kept on ironing. 

i  looked  at  her  a  long  time,  but  couldn't  think  of 
anything to say, and ran back down the three flights to the 
garden where  sally  needed  to be  saved.  i

took  three big

but when i  got there sally said go home. those boys 
said  leave  us  alone.  i  felt  stupid with  my  brick.  they all 
looked at me as  if i  was  the one that was crazy and made 
me feel  ashamed. 

and then i don't know why but i  had to run away.  i 
had to hide myself at the other end of the garden, in the 
jungle part, under a tree that wouldn't mind if i lay down 
and cried a  long time.  i closed  my eyes ljke  tight stars  so 
that  i  wouldn't,  but  i  did.  my  face  felt  hot.  everything 
inside hiccupped

willed  it,  but when i  got up my dress was green and i had 
a  headache. 

i looked at my feet in their white socks and ugly round 
shoes. they seemed far away.  they didn't seem to be my 
feet anymore. and the garden that had been such a good 
place  to  play didn't seem mine either.

sally, you lied. it wasn't what you said at all. what he 
did. where he touched me.  i didn't want it, sally. the way 
they said it, the way  it's supposed to be, all the storybooks 
and movies,  why did you lie  to me? 

i was waiting by the red clowns. i was standing by the 

tilt-a-whirl  where  you  said.  and  anyway  i  don't like car­
nivals.  i went to be with you because you laugh on the tilt­

when i called? why didn't you tell them to leave me alone? 
the one who grabbed me by  the arm, he wouldn't let me 
go. he said i love you, spanish girl, i love you, and pressed 
his  sour mouth to mine. 

sally, make him stop.  i couldn't make them go away. 
i  couldn't do anything but cry.  i don't remember.  it was 
dark.  i  don't remember.  i  don't  remember.  please  don't

that  watched.  the  tilt-a-whirl.  the  red  clowns  laughing 
their thick-tongue laugh. 

then the colors began to whirl. sky tipped. their high

sally got married like we  knew she would, young and 

not  ready  but  married just  the  same.  she  met  a  marsh­
mallow  salesman  at a  school bazaar, and she married  him 
in another state where it's legal to get married before eighth 
grade. she has  her husband and  her house  now,  her pil­

she did it to escape.
