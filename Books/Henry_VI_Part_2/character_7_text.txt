to you duke humfrey must vnload his greefe:
your greefe, the common greefe of all the land.
what? did my brother henry spend his youth,
his valour, coine, and people in the warres?
did he so often lodge in open field:
in winters cold, and summers parching heate,
to conquer france, his true inheritance?
and did my brother bedford toyle his wits,
to keepe by policy what henrie got:
haue you your selues, somerset, buckingham,
braue yorke, salisbury, and victorious warwicke,
receiud deepe scarres in france and normandie:
or hath mine vnckle beauford, and my selfe,
with all the learned counsell of the realme,
studied so long, sat in the councell house,
early and late, debating too and fro
how france and frenchmen might be kept in awe,
and hath his highnesse in his infancie,
crowned in paris in despight of foes,
and shall these labours, and these honours dye?
shall henries conquest, bedfords vigilance,
your deeds of warre, and all

n thou wert regent for our soueraigne,
haue made thee fear'd and honor'd of the people,
ioyne we together for the publike good,
in what we can, to bridle and suppresse
the pride of suffolke, and the cardinall,
with somersets and buckinghams ambition,
and as we may, cherish duke humfries deeds,
while they do tend the profit of the land

   war. so god helpe warwicke, as he loues the land,
and common profit of his countrey

   yor. and so sayes yorke,
for he hath greatest cause

   salisbury. then lets make hast away,
and looke vnto the maine

   warwicke. vnto the maine?
oh father, maine is lost,
that maine, which by maine force warwicke did winne,
and would haue kept, so long as breath did last:
main-chance father you meant, but i meant maine,
which i will win from france, or else be slaine.

exit warwicke, and salisbury. manet yorke.

  yorke. aniou and maine are giuen to the french,
paris is lost, the state of normandie

   queene. beside the haughtie protector, haue we beauford
the imperious churchman; somerset, buckingham,
and grumbling yorke: and not the least of these,
but can doe more in england then the king

   suff. and he of these, that can doe most of all,
cannot doe more in england then the neuils:
salisbury and warwick are no simple peeres

   queene. not all these lords do vex me halfe so much,
as that prowd dame, the lord protectors wife:
she sweepes it through the court with troups of ladies,
more like an empresse, then duke humphreyes wife:
strangers in court, doe take her for the queene:
she beares a dukes reuenewes on her backe,
and in her heart she scornes our pouertie:
shall i not liue to be aueng'd on her?
contemptuous base-borne callot as she is,
she vaunted 'mongst her minion

for i am bold to counsaile you in this;
although we fancie not the cardinall,
yet must we ioyne with him and with the lords,
till we haue brought duke humphrey in disgrace.
as for the duke of yorke, this late complaint
will make but little for his benefit:
so one by one wee'le weed them all at last,
and you your selfe shall steere the happy helme.
