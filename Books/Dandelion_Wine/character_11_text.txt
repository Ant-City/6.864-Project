ing earth as house lights winked slowly on. a 
sprinkle of windows came suddenly alight miles off in dawn country. 

"everyone yawn. everyone up." 

the great house stirred below. 

"grandpa, get your teeth from the water glass!" he waited a decent interval. 
"grandma and great-grandma, fry hot cakes!" 

the warm scent of fried batter rose in the drafty halls to stir the boarders, the aunts, 
the uncles, the visiting cousins, in their rooms. 

"street where all the old people live, wake up! miss helen loomis, colonel freeleigh, 
miss bentley! cough, get up, take pills, move around! mr. jonas, hitch up your horse, get 
your junk wagon out and around!" 

the bleak mansions across the town ravine opened baleful dragon eyes. soon, in the

at all the dogs. "mr. tridden, run to the carbarn!" soon, scattering hot blue sparks above 
it, the town trolley would sail the riverin

sked for a recital of the most 
unusual ices and when the fountain man said, "old fashioned lime-vanilla ice . . ." 

"that's it!" said bill forrester. 

"yes, sir!" said douglas. 

and, while waiting, they turned slowly on their rotating stools. the silver spigots, the 
gleaming mirrors, the hushed whirl-around ceiling fans, the green shades over the small 
windows, the harp-wire chairs, passed under their moving gaze. they stopped turning. 
their eyes had touched upon the face and form of miss helen loomis, ninety-five years 
old, ice-cream spoon in hand, ice cream in mouth. 

"young man," she said to bill forrester, "you are a person of taste and imagination. 
also, you have the will power of ten men; otherwise you would not dare veer away from 
the common flavors listed on the menu and order, straight out, without quibble or 
reservation, such an unheard-of thing as lime-vanilla ice." 

he bowed his head solemnly to her. 

"come sit with me, both of you," she said. "we'll talk of strange ice cr

smiling, they carried their dishes to her table and sat. 

"you look like a spaulding," she said to the boy. "you've got your grandfather's head. 
and you, you're william forrester. you write for the chronicle, a good enough column. 
i've heard more about you than i'd care to tell." 

"i know you," said bill forrester. "you're helen loomis." he hesitated, then continued. 
"t was in love with you once," he said. 

"now that's the way i like a conversation to open." she dug quietly at her ice cream. 
"that's grounds for another meeting. no-don't tell me where or when or how you were in 
love with me. we'll save that for next time. you've taken away my appetite with your 
talk. look there now! well, i must get home anyway. since you're a reporter, come for 
tea tomorrow between three and four; it's just possible i can sketch out the

k at the top of the pyramid, laughing, calling to him to 
come on up the shadowy side into the sun, and he was climbing, she putting her hand 
down to help him up the last step, and then they were laughing on camel back, loping 
toward the great stretched bulk of the sphinx, and late at night, in the native quarter, 
there was the tinkle of small hammers on bronze and silver, and music from some 
stringed instruments fading away and away and away . . . 



william forrester opened his eyes. miss helen loomis had finished the adventure and 
they were home again, very familiar to each other, on the best of terms, in the garden, 
the tea cold in the silver pourer, the biscuits dried in the latened sun. he sighed and 
stretched and sighed again. 

"i've never been so comfortable in my life." 

"nor i." 

"i've kept you late. i should have gone an hour ago." 

"you know i love every minute of it. but what you should see in an old silly 
woman . . ." 

he lay back in his chair and half closed his eyes an

that was the photograph; that was the way he knew her. now he was talking again, 
after the remembering and the thinking over and the holding of the picture in his mind. 
"when i first saw that picture— it was a simple, straightforward picture with a simple 
hairdo— i didn't know it had been taken that long ago. the item in the paper said 
something about helen loomis marshaling the town ball that night. i tore the picture 
from the paper. i carried it with me all that day. i intended going to the ball. then, late 
in the afternoon, someone saw me looking at the picture, and told me about it. how the 
picture of the beautiful girl had been taken so long ago and used every year since by the 
paper. and they said i shouldn't go to the town ball that night, carrying that picture and 
looking for you." 

they sat in the garden for a long minute. he glanced over

and be married and be happy. but you must promise me one thing." 

"anything." 

"you must promise me not to live to be too old, william. if it is at all convenient, die 
before you're fifty. it may take a bit of doing. but i advise this simply because there is no 
telling when another helen loomis might be born. it would be dreadful, wouldn't it, if you 
lived on to be very, very old and some afternoon in 1999 walked down main street and 
saw me standing there, aged twenty-one, and the whole thing out of balance again? i 
don't think we could go through any more afternoons like these we've had, no matter 
how pleasant, do you? a thousand gallons of tea and five hundred biscuits is enough for 
one friendship. so you must have an attack of pneumonia some time in about twenty 
years. for i

lies. it was a rustling night in october, and there she stood, pulling taffy from a hook 
in the kitchen, singing, and there she was, running on the moss by the river, and 
swimming in the granite pit beyond town on a spring night, in the soft deep warm 
waters, and now it was the fourth of july with rockets slamming the sky and every porch 
full of now red-fire, now blue-fire, now white-fire faces, hers dazzling bright among them 
as the last rocket died. 

"can you see all these things?" asked helen loomis. "can you see me doing them and 
being with them?" 

"yes," said william forrester, eyes closed. "i can see you." 
"and then," she said, "and then . . ." 

her voice moved on and on as the afternoon grew late and the twilight deepened 
quickly, but her voice moved in the garden and anyone passing on the road, at a far 
distance, could have heard its moth sound, faintly, faintly . . . 



two days later william forrester was at his desk in his room when the letter came. 
douglas brought it upsta
