ns in the night sky of an as yet unburied summer. 
why and how? 
because i say it is so.

summer, 1974

it was a quiet morning, the town covered over with darkness and at ease in bed. 
summer gathered in the weather, the wind had the proper touch, the breathing of the 
world was long and warm and slow. you had only to rise, lean from your window, and 
know that this indeed was the first real time of freedom and living, this was the first 
morning of summer. 

douglas spaulding, twelve, freshly wakened, let summer idle him on its early-morning 
stream. lying in his third-story cupola bedroom, he felt the tall power it gave him, riding

high in the june wind, the grandest tower in town. at night, when the trees washed 
together, he flashed his gaze like a beacon from this lighthouse in all directions over 
swarming seas of elm and oak and maple. now . . . 

"boy," whispered douglas.

k alarms tinkled faintly. the courthouse clock boomed. birds leaped from trees 
like a net thrown by his hand, singing. douglas, conducting an orchestra, pointed to the 
eastern sky.

he folded his arms and smiled a magician's smile. yes, sir, he thought, everyone 
jumps, everyone runs when i yell. it'll be a fine season. he gave the town a last snap of 
his fingers. 

doors slammed open; people stepped out. 
summer 1928 began. 



crossing the lawn that morning, douglas spaulding broke a spider web with his face. a 
single invisible line on the air touched his brow and snapped without a sound. 

so, with the subtlest of incidents, he knew that this day was going to be different. it 
would be different also, because, as his father explained, driving douglas and his ten- 
year-old brother tom out of town toward the country, there were some days 
compounded completely of odor, nothing but the world blowing in one nostril and out the 
other. and some days, he went on, were

no time machine in there. he's no inventor, and if he was, we'd known about an 
important thing like a time machine years ago." 

charlie and john tiptoed up the front-porch steps. douglas snorted and shook his 
head, staying at the bottom of: the steps. 

"okay, douglas," said charlie. "be a knucklehead. sure, colonel freeleigh didn't invent 
this time machine. but he's got a proprietary interest in it, and it's been here all the 
time. we were too darned dumb to notice! so long, douglas spaulding, to you!" 

charlie took john's elbow as though he was escorting a lady, opened the front-porch 
screen and went in. the screen door did not slam. 

douglas had caught the screen and was following silently. 

charlie walked across the enclosed porch, knocked, and opened the inside door. they 
all peered down a long dark hall toward a room that was lit like an undersea grotto, soft 
green, dim, and watery. 

"colonel freeleigh?"

s. look . . ." 

miss fern and miss roberta peered from the cobwebbed attic window. below, as if no 
great tragedy had occurred, the oaks and elms continued to grow in fresh sunlight. a boy 
strolled by on the sidewalk, turned, strolled by again, looking up. 

in the attic the old women peered at each other as if trying to see their faces in a 
running stream. 

"the police!" 

but no one hammered the downstairs door and cried, "in the name of the law!" 
"who's that boy down there?" 

"douglas, douglas spaulding! lord, he's come to ask for a ride in our green machine. 
he doesn't know. our pride has ruined us. pride and that electrical contraption!" 

"that terrible salesman from gumport falls. it's his fault, him and his talking." 

talking, talking, like soft rain on a summer roof. 

suddenly it was another day, another noon. they sat with white fans and dishes of 
cool, trembling lime jell-0 on their arbored porch.

he ran laughing. he sat easy. he was not a bully. he was kind. his hair was dark and 
curly and his teeth were white as cream. he remembered the words to all the cowboy 
songs and would teach you if you asked. he knew the names of all the wild flowers and 
when the moon would rise and set and when the tides came in or out. he was, in fact, 
the only god living in the whole of green town, illinois, during the twentieth century that 
douglas spaulding knew of. 

and right now he and douglas were hiking out beyond town on another warm and 
marble-round day, the sky blue blown-glass reaching high, the creeks bright with mirror 
waters fanning over white stones. it was a day as perfect as the flame of a candle. 

douglas walked through it thinking it would go on this way forever. the perfection, the 
roundness, the grass smell traveled on out ahead as far and fast as the speed of light. 
the sound of a good friend whistling like an oriole, pegg

grandma, who was going to live forever, can die . . .if all of this is 
true . . . then ... i, douglas spaulding, some day . . . must . . . 



but the fireflies, as if extinguished by his somber thoughts, had softly turned 
themselves off. 

i can't write any more, anyway, thought douglas. i won't write any more. i won't, i 
won't finish it tonight. 

he looked over at tom asleep on his upraised elbow and hand. he touched tom's wrist 
and tom collapsed into a sighing ruin, back upon the bed. 

douglas picked up the mason jar with the cold dark lumps in it and the cool lights 
flicked on again, as if give

the sunlight outside the theater blazed down upon unreal street, unreal buildings, and 
people moving slowly, as if under a bright and heavy ocean of pure burning gas and him 
thinking that now, now at last he must go home and finish out the final line in his nickel 
tablet: some day, i, douglas spaulding, must die . . . 

it had taken him ten minutes to get up enough courage to cross the street, his heart 
slowing, and there was the arcade and he saw the strange wax witch back where she had 
always hidden in cool dusty shadow with the fates and furies tucked under her 
fingernails. a car passing flashed an explosion of light through the arcade, jumping the 
shadows, making it seem that the wax woman nodded swiftly for him to enter. 

and he had gone in at the witch's summoning and come forth fi

tom laughed and shook his brother's arm.

"all that on just this one card?" 

"all that, every single bit of it, tom." 

in the light of the electric bulb they bent, the two boys' heads down, the witch's head 
down, staring and staring at the beautiful blank but promising white card, their bright 
eyes sensing each and every incredibly hidd
