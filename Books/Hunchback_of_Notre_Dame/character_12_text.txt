al gave the order to
continue, the gallery was far from full, and that after the flemish
envoys there had arrived new personages forming part of the cortege,
whose names and ranks, shouted out in the midst of his dialogue by the
intermittent cry of the usher, produced considerable ravages in it. let
the reader imagine the effect in the midst of a theatrical piece, of the
yelping of an usher, flinging in between two rhymes, and often in the
middle of a line, parentheses like the following,--

“master jacques charmolue, procurator to the king in the ecclesiastical
courts!”

“jehan de harlay, equerry guardian of the office of chevalier of the
night watch of the city of paris!”

“messire galiot de genoilhac, chevalier, seigneur de brussac, master of
the king’s artillery!”

“master dreux-raguier, surveyor of the woods and forests of the king our
sovereign, in the land of france, champagne and brie!”

the king, admiral of fran

question her goat.

“djali, what does master guichard grand-remy, captain of the pistoliers
of the town do, at the procession of candlemas?”

djali reared himself on his hind legs, and began to bleat, marching
along with so much dainty gravity, that the entire circle of spectators
burst into a laugh at this parody of the interested devoutness of the
captain of pistoliers.

“djali,” resumed the young girl, emboldened by her growing success,
“how preaches master jacques charmolue, procurator to the king in the
ecclesiastical court?”

the goat seated himself on his hind quarters, and began to bleat, waving
his fore feet in so strange a manner, that, with the exception of
the bad french, and worse latin, jacques charmolue was there
complete,--gesture, accent, and attitude.

and the crowd applauded louder than ever.

“sacrilege! profanation!” resumed the voice of the bald man.

the gypsy turned round once more.

difference between monseigneur and monsieur, between _domine_ and
_domne_. it was evidently the meeting of a teacher and a disciple.

“well!” resumed the archdeacon, after a fresh silence which master
jacques took good care not to disturb, “how are you succeeding?”

“alas! master,” said the other, with a sad smile, “i am still seeking
the stone. plenty of ashes. but not a spark of gold.”

dom claude made a gesture of impatience. “i am not talking to you of
that, master jacques charmolue, but of the trial of your magician. is it
not marc cenaine that you call him? the butler of the court of accounts?
does he confess his witchcraft? have you been successful with the
torture?”

“alas! no,” replied master jacques, still with his sad smile; “we have
not that consolation. that man is a stone. we might have him boiled in
the marché aux pourceaux, before he would say anything. nevertheless, we
are sparing nothing for the sake of getting at the truth; he is already

“oh!” said he, “good and honorable pavement of paris, cursed staircase,
fit to put the angels of jacob’s ladder out of breath! what was i
thinking of to thrust myself into that stone gimlet which pierces the
sky; all for the sake of eating bearded cheese, and looking at the
bell-towers of paris through a hole in the wall!”

he advanced a few paces, and caught sight of the two screech owls,
that is to say, dom claude and master jacques charmolue, absorbed in
contemplation before a carving on the façade. he approached them on
tiptoe, and heard the archdeacon say in a low tone to charmolue: “‘twas
guillaume de paris who caused a job to be carved upon this stone of
the hue of lapis-lazuli, gilded on the edges. job represents the
philosopher’s stone, which must also be tried and martyrized in order
to become perfect, as saith raymond lulle: _sub conservatione formoe

did not love the magistracy, which arose, possibly, from the grudge
which he cherished against the palais de justice since his dramatic
misadventure.

“they are messieurs the masters of requests of the king’s household.”

“and that boar in front of him?”

“he is monsieur the clerk of the court of parliament.”

“and that crocodile on the right?”

“master philippe lheulier, advocate extraordinary of the king.”

“and that big, black tom-cat on the left?”

“master jacques charmolue, procurator of the king in the ecclesiastical
court, with the gentlemen of the officialty.”

“come now, monsieur,” said gringoire, “pray what are all those fine
fellows doing yonder?”

“they are judging.”

“judging whom? i do not see the accused.”

“‘tis a woman, sir. you cannot see her. she has her back turned to us,
and she is hidden from us by the crowd. stay, yonder she is, where you
see a group of partisans.”

“who is the woman?” asked gringoire. “do you know

t a dagger was found on the person of the accused. goody falourdel,
have you brought that leaf into which the crown which the demon gave you
was transformed?

“yes, monseigneur,” she replied; “i found it again. here it is.”

a bailiff banded the dead leaf to the crocodile, who made a doleful
shake of the head, and passed it on to the president, who gave it to the
procurator of the king in the ecclesiastical court, and thus it made the
circuit of the hail.

“it is a birch leaf,” said master jacques charmolue. “a fresh proof of
magic.”

a counsellor took up the word.

“witness, two men went upstairs together in your house: the black man,
whom you first saw disappear and afterwards swimming in the seine, with
his priestly garments, and the officer. which of the two handed you
the crown?” the old woman pondered for a moment and then said,--“the
officer.”

a murmur ran through the crowd.

“ah!” thought gringoire, “this makes some doubt in my mind.”

but master philippe lheulier, adv

“do i deny it?” she said with terrible accents; and she rose with
flashing eyes.

the president continued squarely,--

“then how do you explain the facts laid to your charge?”

she replied in a broken voice,--

“i have already told you. i do not know. ‘twas a priest, a priest whom i
do not know; an infernal priest who pursues me!”

“that is it,” retorted the judge; “the surly monk.”

“oh, gentlemen! have mercy! i am but a poor girl--”

“of egypt,” said the judge.

master jacques charmolue interposed sweetly,--

“in view of the sad obstinacy of the accused, i demand the application
of the torture.”

“granted,” said the president.

the unhappy girl quivered in every limb. but she rose at the command of
the men with partisans, and walked with a tolerably firm step, preceded
by charmolue and the priests of the officiality, between two rows of
halberds, towards a medium-sized door which suddenly opened and closed
again behind her, and which produced upon the grief-stricken gr

on the bed, in a negligent attitude, sat pierrat torterue, the official
torturer. his underlings, two gnomes with square faces, leather aprons,
and linen breeches, were moving the iron instruments on the coals.

in vain did the poor girl summon up her courage; on entering this
chamber she was stricken with horror.

the sergeants of the bailiff of the courts drew up in line on one side,
the priests of the officiality on the other. a clerk, inkhorn, and a
table were in one corner.

master jacques charmolue approached the gypsy with a very sweet smile.

“my dear child,” said he, “do you still persist in your denial?”

“yes,” she replied, in a dying voice.

“in that case,” replied charmolue, “it will be very painful for us to
have to question you more urgently than we should like. pray take the
trouble to seat yourself on this bed. master pierrat, make room for
mademoiselle, and close the door.”

pierrat rose with a growl.

“if i shut the door,” he muttered, “my fire will

had closed through fear.

a tumbrel drawn by a stout norman horse, and all surrounded by cavalry
in violet livery with white crosses, had just debouched upon the place
through the rue saint-pierre-aux-boeufs. the sergeants of the watch were
clearing a passage for it through the crowd, by stout blows from their
clubs. beside the cart rode several officers of justice and police,
recognizable by their black costume and their awkwardness in the saddle.
master jacques charmolue paraded at their head.

in the fatal cart sat a young girl with her arms tied behind her back,
and with no priest beside her. she was in her shift; her long black hair
(the fashion then was to cut it off only at the foot of the gallows)
fell in disorder upon her half-bared throat and shoulders.

athwart that waving hair, more glossy than the plumage of a raven, a
thick, rough, gray rope was visible, twisted and knotted, chafing her
delicate collar-bones and twining round the charming neck of th

“be at ease,” replied gringoire. “‘tis one of my friends.” then the
philosopher setting his lantern on the ground, crouched upon the stones,
and exclaimed enthusiastically, as he pressed djali in his arms,--

“oh! ‘tis a graceful beast, more considerable no doubt, for it’s
neatness than for its size, but ingenious, subtle, and lettered as a
grammarian! let us see, my djali, hast thou forgotten any of thy pretty
tricks? how does master jacques charmolue?...”

the man in black did not allow him to finish. he approached gringoire
and shook him roughly by the shoulder.

gringoire rose.

“‘tis true,” said he: “i forgot that we are in haste. but that is no
reason master, for getting furious with people in this manner. my dear
and lovely child, your life is in danger, and djali’s also. they want
to hang you again. we are your friends, and we have come to save you.
