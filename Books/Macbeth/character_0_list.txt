[CHARACTER] - 
                [CHARACTER]
is a scottish general and the thane of glamis who is led to wicked
thoughts by the prophecies of the three witches, especially after
their prophecy that he will be made thane of cawdor comes true.
[CHARACTER] is a brave soldier and a powerful man, but he is not a virtuous
one. he is easily tempted into murder to fulfill his ambitions to
the throne, and once he commits his first crime and is crowned king
of scotland, he embarks on further atrocities with increasing ease.
ultimately, [CHARACTER] proves himself better suited to the battlefield than
to political intrigue, because he lacks the skills necessary to
rule without being a tyrant. his response to every problem is violence
and murder. unlike shakespeare's great villains, such as iago in othello and
richard iii in richard iii, [CHARACTER] is never comfortable
in his role as a criminal. he is unable to bear the psychological
consequences of his atrocities.
