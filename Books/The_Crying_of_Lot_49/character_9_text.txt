t each time went ragged or wavered violently before she could take the brush away. she'd been up 
most of the night, after another three-in-the-morning phone call, its announcing bell clear cardiac terror, so out of nothing did it come, 
the instrument one second inert, the next screaming. it brought both of them instantly awake and they lay, joints unlocking, not even 
wanting to look at each other for the first few rings. she finally, having nothing she knew of to lose, had taken it. it was dr hilarius, her 
shrink or psychotherapist. but he sounded like pierce doing a gestapo officer. 

"i didn't wake you up, did i," he began, dry. "you sound so frightened. how are the pills, not working?" 

"i'm not taking them," she said. 
"you feel threatened by them?" 
"i don't know what's inside them." 

"you don't believe that they're only tranquiliz-ers." 
"do i trust you?" she didn't, and what he said next explained why not. 
"we still need a hundred-and-fourth for the bridge." chuckled aridly. the b

"no," she said, "you have half a million others to choose from. it's three in the morning." 
"we want you." hanging in the air over her bed she now beheld the well-known portrait of uncle that appears in front of all our 
post offices, his eyes gleaming unhealthily, his sunken yellow cheeks most violently rouged, his finger pointing between her eyes. i 
want you. she had never asked dr hilarius why, being afraid of all he might answer. 

"i am having a hallucination now, i don't need drugs for that." 
"don't describe it," he said quickly. "well. was there anything else you wanted to talk about." "did i call you?" 
"i thought so," he said, "i had this feeling. not telepathy. but rapport with a patient is a curious thing sometimes." 
"not this time." she hung up. and then couldn't get to sleep. but would be damned if she'd take the capsules he'd given her.

 want to get hooked in any way, she'd told him that. "so," he shrugged, "on me you are not hooked? 
leave then. you're cured." 

she didn't leave. not that the shrink held any dark power over her. but it was easier to stay. who'd know the day she was cured? 
not him, he'd admitted that himself. "pills are different," she pleaded. hilarius only made a face at her, one he'd made before. he was 
full of these delightful lapses from orthodoxy. his theory being that a face is symmetrical like a rorschach blot, tells a story like a tat 
picture, excites a response like a suggested word, so why not. he claimed to have once cured a case of hysterical blindness with his 
number 37, the "fu-manchu" (many of the faces having like german symphonies both a number and nickname), which involved 
slanting the eyes up with the index fingers, enl

arging the nostrils with the middle fingers, pulling the mouth wide with the pinkies 
and protruding the tongue. on hilarius it was truly alarming. and in fact, as oedipa's uncle sam hallucination faded, it was this 
fu-manchu face that came dissolving in to replace it and stay with her for what was left of the hours before dawn. it put her in hardly 
any shape to see roseman. 

but roseman had also spent a sleepless night, brooding over the perry mason television program the evening before, which 
his wife was fond of but toward which roseman cherished a fierce ambivalence, wanting at once to be a successful trial l

, then, with no idea she was moving toward anything new. mucho maas, enigmatic, whistling "i want to kiss your 
feet," a new recording by sick dick and the volkswagens (an english group he was fond of at that time but did not believe in), 
stood with hands in pockets while she explained about going down to san narciso for a while to look into pierce's books and records 
and confer with metzger, the co-executor. mucho was sad to see her go, but not desperate, so after telling him to hang up if dr hilarius 

called and look after the oregano in the garden, which had contracted a. strange mold, she went. 

 

san narciso lay further south, near l.a. like many named places in california it was less an identifiable city than a 

grouping of concepts—census tracts, special purpose bond-issue districts, shopping nuclei, all overlaid with access roads to its 
own freeway. but it had been pierce's domicile, and headquarters: the place he'd begun his land speculating in ten years ago, and

"think of it," he went on, also drunk. "a whole underworld of suicides who failed. all keeping in touch through that secret 
delivery system. what do they tell each other?" he shook his head, smiling, stumbled off his stool and headed off to take a leak, 
disappearing into the dense crowd. he didn't come back. 

oedipa sat, feeling as alone as she ever had, now the only woman, she saw, in a room full of drunken male homosexuals. 

story of my life, she thought, mucho won't talk to me, hilarius won't listen, clerk maxwell didn't even look at me, and this 
group, god knows. despair came over her, as it will when nobody around has any sexual relevance to you. she gauged the 
spectrum of feeling out there as running from really violent hate (an indian-looking kid hardly out of his teens, with frosted 
shoulder-length hair tucked behind his ears and pointed cowboy boots) to dry speculation (a hornrimmed ss type who stared at 
her legs, trying to figure out if she was in drag), none of whi

partner. jesus arrabal 
would have called it an anarchist miracle. oedipa, withno name for it, was\only demoralized. she curtsied andfled. 

! 
next day, after twelve hours of sleep and no dreams to speak of, oedipa checked out of the hotel and drove down the 

peninsula to kinneret. she had decided on route, with time to think about the day preceding, to go see dr hilarius her shrink, 
and tell him all. she might well be in the cold and sweatless meathooks of a psychosis. with her own eyes she had verified a 
waste system: seen two waste postmen, a waste mailbox, waste stamps, waste cancellations. and the image of 
the muted post horn all but saturating the bay area. yet she wanted it all to be fantasy—some clear result of her several 
wounds, needs, dark doubles. she wanted hilarius to tell her she was some kind of a nut and needed a rest, and that there was n

she pulled into the drive at hilarius's clinic a little after sunset. the light in his office didn't seem to be on. eucalyptus 

branches blew in a great stream of air that flowed downhill, sucked to the evening sea. halfway along the flagstone path, she 
was startled by an insect whirring loudly past her ear, followed at once by the sound of a gunshot. that was no insect, 
thought oedipa, at which point, hearing another shot, she made the connection. in the fading light she was a clear target; the 
only way to go was toward the cl

inic. she dashed up to the glass doors, found them locked, the lobby inside dark. oedipa 
picked up a rock next to a flower bed and heaved it at one of the doors. it bounced off. she was looking around for another rock 
when a white shape appeared inside, fluttering up to the door and unlocking it for her. it was helga blamm, hilarius's sometime 
assistant. 

"hurry," she chattered, as oedipa slipped inside. the woman was close to hysterical. 

"what's happening?" oedipa said. 

"he's gone crazy. i tried to call the police, but he took a chair and smashed the switchboard with it." 

"dr hilarius?" 

"he thinks someone's after him." tear streaks had meandered down over the nurse's cheekbones. "he's locked himself in 

the office with that rifle." a gewehr 43, from the war, oedipa recalled, that he kept as a souvenir. 
"he sho

of nothing but. he couldn't cope." 

"i've been away for a while," oedipa said. "maybe i could find out what it is. maybe i'd be less of a threat for him." blamm 

burned her mouth on the coffee. "start telling him your troubles and he'll probably shoot you." 

in front of his door, which she could never remember having seen closed, oedipa stood hipshot awhile, questioning her 

own sanity. why hadn't she split out through blamm's window and read about the rest of it in the paper? 

"who is it?" hilarius screamed, having picked up her breathing, or something. 

"mrs maas." 

"may speer and his ministry of cretins rot eternally in hell. do you realize that half these rounds are duds?" 

"may i come in? could we talk?" 
"i'm sure you'd all like that," hilarius said. 
"i'm unarmed. you can frisk me." 

"while you karate-chop me in the spine, no thank you." 
"why are you resisting every suggestion i make?" 
"listen," hilarius said after awhile, "have i seemed to you a good enough freudian? have i e

"and part of me must have really wanted to believe 
—like a child hearing, in perfect safety, a tale of horror 

—that the unconscious would be like any other room, once the light was let in. that the dark shapes would resolve only into toy horses and 
biedermeyer furniture. that therapy could tame it after all, bring it into society with no fear of its someday reverting. i wanted to believe, 
despite everything my life had been. can you 
imagine?" 

 

she could not, having no idea what hilarius had done before showing up in kinneret. far away she now heard sirens, the electronic kind the 

local cops used, that sounded like a slide-whistle being played over a pa. system. with linear obstinacy they grew louder. 

"yes, i hear them," hilarius said. "do you think anyone can protect me from these fanatics? they walk through walls. they replicate: 

you flee them, turn a corner, and there they are, coming for you again." 

"do me a favor?" oedipa said. "don't shoot at the cops, they're on

your side." 
"your israeli has access to every uniform known," hilarius said. "i can't guarantee the safety of the 'police.' you couldn't guarantee where 

they'd take me if i surrendered, could you." 

she heard him pacing around his office. unearthly siren-sounds converged on them from all over the night. "there is a face," hilarius said, 

"that i can make. one you haven't seen; no one in this country has. i have only made it once in my life, and perhaps today in central europe 
there still lives, in whatever vegetable ruin, the young man who saw it. he would be, now, about your age. hopelessly insane. his name was 
zvi. will you tell the 'police,' or whatever they are calling themselves tonight, that i can make that face again? that it has an 
effective radius of a hundred yards and drives anyone unlucky enough to see it

 down forever into the darkened oubliette, 
among the terrible shapes, and secures the hatch irrevocably above them? thank you." 

the sirens had reached the front of the clinic. she heard car doors slamming, cops yelling, suddenly a great smash as they 

broke in. the office door opened then. hilarius grabbed her by the wrist, pulled her inside, locked the door again. 
"so now i'm a hostage," oedipa said. 
"oh," said hilarius, "it's you." 
"well who did you think you'd been——" 

"discussing my case with? another. there is me, there are the others. you know, with the lsd, we're finding, the 

distinction begins to vanish. egos lose their sharp edges. but i never took the drug, i chose to remain in relative paranoia, where 
at least i know who i am and who the others are. perhaps that is why you also refused to participate, mrs maas?" he held the rifle 
at sling arms and beamed at her. "well, then. you were suppos

you supposed to say?" 

oedipa shrugged. "face up to your social responsibilities," she suggested. "accept the reality principle. you're outnumbered 

and they have superior firepower." 

"ah, outnumbered. we were outnumbered there too." he watched her with a coy look. 

"where?" 

"where i made that face. where i did my internship." 
she knew then approximately what he was talking about, but to narrow it said, "where," again. 
"buchenwald," replied hilarius. cops began hammering on the office door. 

"he has a gun," oedipa called, "and i'm in 
here." 

"who are you, lady?" she told him. "how do you spell that first name?" he also took down her address, age, phone number, 
next of kin, husband's occupation, for the news media. hilarius all the while was rummaging in his desk for more ammo. "can you 
talk him out of it?" the cop wanted to know. "tv folks would like to get some footage through the window. could you keep him 
occupied?" 
"hang tough,"

 oedipa advised, "we'll see." "nice act you all have there," nodded hilarius. "you think," said oedipa, "then, that 
they're trying to bring you back to israel, to stand trial, like they did eichinann?" the shrink kept nodding. "why? what did 
you do at buchenwald?" 

"i worked," hilarius told her, "on experimentally-induced insanity. a catatonic jew was as good as a dead one. liberal ss 
circles felt it would be more humane." so they had gone at their subjects with metronomes, serpents, brechtian vignettes at 
midnight, surgical removal of certain glands, magic-lantern hallucinations, new drugs, threats recited over hidden 
loudspeakers, hypnotism, clocks that ran backward, and faces. hilarius had been put in charge of faces. "the allied

not to dream, and spent the other 21 at the forcible acquisition of faith. and yet my penance hasn't been enough. they've come like angels 
of death to get me, despite all i tried to do." 
"how's it going?" the cop inquired. 

"just marv," said oedipa. "i'll let you know if it's hopeless." then she saw that hilarius had left the gewehr on his desk and was 

across the room ostensibly trying to open a file cabinet. she picked the rifle up, pointed it at him, and said, "i ought to kill you." she knew 
he had wanted her to get the weapon. 

"isn't that what you've been sent to do?" he crossed and uncrossed his eyes at her; stuck out his tongue tentatively. 
"i came," she said, "hoping you could talk me out of a fantasy." 
"cherish it!" cried hilarius, fiercely. "what else do any of you have? hold it tightly b

"come on in," oedipa yelled. 

tears sprang to hilarius's eyes. "you aren't going to shoot?" 
the cop tried the door. "it's locked, hey," he said. 
"bust it down," roared oedipa, "and hitler hilarius here will foot the bill." 
outside, as a number of nervous patrolmen approached hilarius, holding up strait jackets and billy clubs they would not need, 
and as three rival ambulances backed snarling up onto the lawn, jockeying for position, causing helga blamm between sobs to call 
the drivers filthy names, oedipa spotted among searchlights and staring crowds a kcuf mobile unit, with her husband mucho 
inside it, spieling into a microphone. she moseyed over past snapping flashbulbs and stuck h

 only smiled. it seemed odd. how could they hear a smile? oedipa got in, trying 
not to make noise. mucho thrust the mike in front of her, mumbling, "you're on, just be yourself." then in his earnest 
broadcasting voice, "how do you feel about this terrible thing?" "terrible," said oedipa. 

"wonderful," said mucho. he had her go on to give listeners a summary of what'd happened in the office. "thank you, mrs 

edna mosh," he wrapped up, "for your eyewitness account of this dramatic siege at the hilarius psychiatric clinic. this is kcuf 
mobile two, sending it back now to 'rabbit' warren, at the studio." he cut his power. something was not quite right. 
"edna mosh?" oedipa said. "it'll come out the right way," mucho said. "i was allowing for the distortion on these rigs, and then when 
they put it on tape." 
"where are they taking him?" "community hospital, i guess," mucho said, "for observation. i wonder what they can observe."
