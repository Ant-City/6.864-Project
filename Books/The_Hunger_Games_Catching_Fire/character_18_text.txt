€œabout trying to subdue things in the districts,â€ he says. 

my head turns swiftly from side to side, but no one seems to have heard. the camera crew 
got sidetracked at a table of shellfish, and the couples dancing around us are either too drunk 
or too self-involved to notice. 

â€œsorry,â€ he says. he should be. this is no place to be voicing such thoughts. 

â€œsave it for home,â€ i tell him. 

just then portia appears with a large man who looks vaguely familiar. she introduces him 
as plutarch heavensbee, the new head gamemaker. plutarch asks peeta if he can steal me for 
a dance. peeta's recovered  his camera  face and good-naturedly passes  me over, warning the 
man not to get too attached. 

i don't want to dance with plutarch heavensbee. i don't want to feel his hands, one resting 
against mine, one on  my  hip. i'm  not  used to  being touched, except by peeta or my  family, 
and  i  rank  gamemakers  somewhere  below  maggots  in  terms  of  creatures  i  want  in  contact

ta singling himself out as a target 
for the gamemakers' anger. that's part of my job. to draw fire away from peeta. but how did 
he upset them? because i'd love to do just that and more. to break through the smug veneer 
of those who use their brains to find amusing ways to kill us. to make them realize that while 
we're vulnerable to the capitol's cruelties, they are as well. 

do you have any idea how much i hate you? i think. you, who have given your talents to 

the games? 

i try to catch plutarch heavensbee's eye, but he seems to be intentionally ignoring me, as 
he has the entire training period. i remember how he sought me out for a dance, how pleased 
he was to show me the mockingjay on his watch. his friendly manner has no place here. how 
could it, when i'm a mere tribute and he's the head gamemaker? so powerful, so removed, so 
safe ... 

suddenly i know just what i'm going to do. something that will blow anything peeta did 
right out of the water. i go over to the knot-tying  station and g

the effect on the gamemakers is immediate and satisfying. several let out small shrieks. 
others lose their grips on their wineglasses, which shatter musically against the ground. two 
seem to be considering fainting. the look of shock is unanimous. 

now i have plutarch heavensbee's attention. he stares steadily at me as the juice from the 
peach he crushed  in  his  hand runs through his  fingers. finally  he clears his throat  and says, 
â€œyou may go now, miss everdeen.â€ 

i  give  a  respectful  nod  and  turn  to  go,  but  at  the  last  moment  i  can't  resist  tossing  the 
container of berry juice over my shoulder. i can hear the contents splatter against the dummy 
while a couple more wineglasses break. as the elevator doors close before me, i see no one

â€œdid you see any water?â€ asks finnick. 

â€œonly the saltwater where we started the games,â€ i say. 

â€œthere must be some other source,â€ says peeta, frowning. â€œor we'll all be dead in a matter 

of days.â€ 

â€œwell,  the  foliage  is  thick.  maybe  there  are  ponds  or  springs  somewhere,â€  i  say 
doubtfully. i instinctively feel the capitol might want these unpopular games over as soon as 
possible. plutarch heavensbee might have already been given orders to knock us off. â€œat any 
rate, there's no point in trying to find out what's over the edge of this hill, because the answer 
is nothing.â€ 

â€œthere must be drinkable water between the force field and the wheel,â€ peeta insists. we 
all  know  what  this  means.  heading  back  down.  heading  back  to  the  careers  and  the 
bloodshed. with mags hardly able to walk and peeta too weak to fight.

â€œyes, tick, tock, the arena's a clock. it's a clock, wiress, you were right,â€ i say. â€œyou were 

right.â€ 

relief  floods  her  face  â€”  i  guess  because  somebody  has  finally  understood  what  she's 

known probably from the first tolling of the bells. â€œmidnight.â€ 

â€œit starts at midnight,â€ i confirm. 

a  memory  struggles  to  surface  in  my  brain.  i  see  a  clock.  no,  it's  a  watch,  resting  in 
plutarch heavensbee's palm. â€œit starts at midnight,â€ plutarch said. and then my mockingjay 
lit up briefly and vanished. in retrospect, it's like he was giving me a clue about the arena. but 
why would he? at the time, i was no more a tribute in these games than he was. maybe  he 
thought it would help me as a mentor. or maybe this had been the plan all along. 

wiress nods at the blood rain. â€œone-thirty,â€ she says. 

â€œexactly. one-thirty. and at two, a terrible poisonous fog begins there,â€ i say, poin

nonexistent. it doesn't matter. i'm not escaping, just finishing a job. 

i creep down a narrow hallway to a metal door that stands slightly ajar. someone is behind 
it. i take out the syringe and grip it in my hand. flattening myself against the wall, i listen to 
the voices inside. 

â€œcommunications  are  down  in  seven,  ten,  and  twelve.  but  eleven  has  control  of 

transportation now, so there's at least a hope of them getting some food out.â€ 

plutarch heavensbee. i think.  although i've only  really spoken with  him once. a  hoarse 

voice asks a question. 

â€œno, i'm sorry. there's no way i can get you to four. but i've given special orders for her 

retrieval if possible. it's the best i can do, finnick.â€ 

finnick. my mind struggles to make sense of the conversation, of the fact that it's taking 
place  between  plutarch  heavensbee  and  finnick.  is  he  so  near  and  dear  to the  capitol  that 
he'll be excused his crimes? or did he really h
