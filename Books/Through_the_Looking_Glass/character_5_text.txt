the end of the pencil, which came some
way over his shoulder, and began writing for him.

the poor king looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil
for some time without saying anything; but alice was too strong for him,
and at last he panted out, â€˜my dear! i really must get a thinner pencil.
i canâ€™t manage this one a bit; it writes all manner of things that i
donâ€™t intend--â€™

â€˜what manner of things?â€™ said the queen, looking over the book (in which
alice had put â€˜the white knight is sliding down the poker. he balances
very badlyâ€™) â€˜thatâ€™s not a memorandum of your feelings!â€™

there was a book lying near alice on the table, and while she sat
watching the white king (for she was still a little anxious about him,
and had the ink all ready to throw over him, in case he fainted again),
she turned over the leaves, to find some part that she could read,
â€˜--for itâ€™s all in some language i donâ€™t know,â€™ she said to herself.

it was like this.

eat club. just as he reached
her, the horse stopped suddenly: â€˜youâ€™re my prisoner!â€™ the knight cried,
as he tumbled off his horse.

startled as she was, alice was more frightened for him than for herself
at the moment, and watched him with some anxiety as he mounted again.
as soon as he was comfortably in the saddle, he began once more â€˜youâ€™re
my--â€™ but here another voice broke in â€˜ahoy! ahoy! check!â€™ and alice
looked round in some surprise for the new enemy.

this time it was a white knight. he drew up at aliceâ€™s side, and tumbled
off his horse just as the red knight had done: then he got on again,
and the two knights sat and looked at each other for some time without
speaking. alice looked from one to the other in some bewilderment.

â€˜sheâ€™s my prisoner, you know!â€™ the red knight said at last.

â€˜yes, but then _i_ came and rescued her!â€™ the white knight replied.

â€˜well, we must fight for her, then,â€™ said the red knight, as he took up
his helmet (which hung from the

saddle, and was something the shape of a
horseâ€™s head), and put it on.

â€˜you will observe the rules of battle, of course?â€™ the white knight
remarked, putting on his helmet too.

â€˜i always do,â€™ said the red knight, and they began banging away at each
other with such fury that alice got behind a tree to be out of the way
of the blows.

â€˜i wonder, now, what the rules of battle are,â€™ she said to herself, as
she watched the fight, timidly peeping out from her hiding-place: â€˜one
rule seems to be, that if one knight hits the other, he knocks him off
his horse, and if he misses, he tumbles off himself--and another rule
seems to b

n they tumble! just like
a whole set of fire-irons falling into the fender! and how quiet the
horses are! they let them get on and off them just as if they were
tables!â€™

another rule of battle, that alice had not noticed, seemed to be that
they always fell on their heads, and the battle ended with their both
falling off in this way, side by side: when they got up again, they
shook hands, and then the red knight mounted and galloped off.

â€˜it was a glorious victory, wasnâ€™t it?â€™ said the white knight, as he
came up panting.

â€˜i donâ€™t know,â€™ alice said doubtfully. â€˜i donâ€™t want to be anybodyâ€™s
prisoner. i want to be a queen.â€™

â€˜so you will, when youâ€™ve crossed the next brook,â€™ said the white
knight. â€˜iâ€™ll see you safe to the end of the wood--and then i must go
back, you know. thatâ€™s the end of my move.â€™

â€˜thank you very much,â€™ said alice. â€˜may i help you off with your
helmet?â€™ it was evidently more than he could manage by himself; however,
she managed to s

€™ she said cheerfully. â€˜is that your
invention too?â€™

the knight looked down proudly at his helmet, which hung from the
saddle. â€˜yes,â€™ he said, â€˜but iâ€™ve invented a better one than that--like
a sugar loaf. when i used to wear it, if i fell off the horse, it always
touched the ground directly. so i had a very little way to fall, you
see--but there was the danger of falling into it, to be sure. that
happened to me once--and the worst of it was, before i could get out
again, the other white knight came and put it on. he thought it was his
own helmet.â€™

the knight looked so solemn about it that alice did not dare to laugh.
â€˜iâ€™m afraid you must have hurt him,â€™ she said in a trembling voice,
â€˜being on the top of his head.â€™

â€˜i had to kick him, of course,â€™ the knight said, very seriously. â€˜and
then he took the helmet off again--but it took hours and hours to get me
out. i was as fast as--as lightning, you know.â€™

â€˜but thatâ€™s a different kind of fastness,â€™ alice obje
