ert. i've asked for dr.
guitierrez to visit us here. he is a senior researcher at the reserva biol¢gica de carara, which is
across the bay. perhaps he can identify the animal for us."
"isn't there someone from cabo blanco?" bowman asked. "that's where she was bitten."
"unfortunately not," dr. cruz said. "cabo blanco has no permanent staff, and no researcher
has worked there for some time. you were probably the first people to walk on that beach in
several months. but i am sure you will find dr. guitierrez to be knowledgeable."
dr. guitierrez turned out to be a bearded man wearing khaki shorts and shirt. the surprise was
that he was american. he was introduced to the bowmans, saying in a soft southern accent, "mr.
and mrs. bowman, how you doing, nice to meet you," and then explaining that he was a field
biologist from yale who had worked in costa rica for the last five years. marty guitierrez
examined tina thoroughly, lifting her arm gently, peering closely at each of the bites with a
penlight, t

hen measuring them with a small pocket ruler. after a while, guitierrez stepped away,
nodding to himself as if he had understood something. he then inspected the polaroids, and
asked several questions about the saliva, which cruz told him was still being tested in the lab.
finally he turned to mike bowman and his wife, waiting tensely. "i think tina's going to be fine.
i just want to be clear about a few details," he said, making notes in a precise band. "your
daughter says she was bitten by a green lizard, approximately one foot high, which walked
upright onto the

 beach from the mangrove swamp?"
"that's right, yes."
"and the lizard made some kind of a vocalization?"
"tina said it chirped, or squeaked."
"like a mouse, would you say?"
"yes."
"well, then," dr. guitierrez said, "i know this lizard." he explained that, of the six thousand
species of lizards in the world, no more than a dozen species walked upright. of those species,
only four were found in latin america. and judging by the coloration, the lizard could be only one
of the four. "i am sure this lizard was a basiliscus amoratus, a striped basilisk lizard, found here 
in costa rica and also in honduras. standing on their hind legs, they are sometimes as tall as a
foot."
"are they poisonous?"
"no, mrs.

 bowman. not at all." guitierrez explained that the swelling in tina's arm was an
allergic reaction. "according to the literature, fourteen percent of people are strongly allergic to
reptiles," he said, "and your daughter seems to be one of them."
"she was screaming, she said it was so painful."
"probably it was," guitierrez said. "reptile saliva contains serotonin, which causes tremendous
pain." he turned to cruz. "her blood pressure came down with antihistamines?"
"yes," cruz said. "promptly."
"serotonin," guitierrez said. "no question."
still, ellen bowman remained uneasy. "but why would a lizard bite her in the first place?"
"lizard bites are very common," guitierrez said. "animal handlers in zoos get bitten all the
time. and just the other day i heard that a lizard had bitten an infant in her crib in amaloya,

about
sixty miles from where you were. so bites do occur. i'm not sure why your daughter had so many
bites. what was she doing at the time?"
"nothing. she said she was sitting pretty still, because she didn't want to frighten it away."
"sitting pretty still," guitierrez said, frowning. he shook his head. "well. i don't think we can say
exactly what happened. wild animals are unpredictable."
"and what about the foamy saliva on her arm?" ellen said. "i keep thinking about rabies. . . ."
"no, no," dr. guitierrez said. "a reptile can't carry rabies, mrs. bowman. your daughter has
suffered an allergic reaction to the bite of a basilisk lizard. nothing more serious."
mike bowman then showed guitierrez the picture that tina had drawn. guitierrez nodded. "i

this as a picture of a basillsk lizard," he said. "a few details are wrong, of course.
the neck is much too long, and she has drawn the hind legs with only three toes instead of five.
the tall is too thick, and raised too high. but otherwise this is a perfectly serviceable lizard of the
kind we are talking about."
"but tina specifically said the neck was long," ellen bowman insisted. "and she said there
were three toes on the foot."
"tina's pretty observant," mike bowman said.
"i'm sure she is," guitierrez said, smiling. "but i still think your daughter was bitten by a
common basilisk amoratus, and had a severe herpetological reaction. normal time course with
medication is twelve hours. she should be just fine in the morning."
in the modern laboratory in the basement of the cl¡nica santa maria, word was received that dr.
guitierrez had identified the animal that had bitten the american child as a harmless basilisk
lizard. immediately the analysis of the saliva was halted, even though a prelimina

you know that?"
"because i looked," she said. "anyway, all the birds on the beach made marks in the sand with
three toes, like this." she held up her hand, middle three fingers spread wide. "and the lizard
made those kind of marks in the sand, too."
"the lizard made marks like a bird?"
"uh-huh," tina said. "he walked like a bird, too. he jerked his head like this, up and down."
she took a few steps, bobbing her head.
after the bowmans had departed, dr. cruz decided to report this conversation to guitierrez, at
the biological station.
"i must admit the girl's story is puzzling," guitierrez said. "i have been doing some checking
myself. i am no longer certain she was bitten by a basilisk. not certain at all."
"then what could it be?"
"well," guitierrez said, "let's not speculate prematurely. by the way, have you heard of any
other lizard bites at the hospital?"
"no, why?"
"let me know, my friend, if you do."

he then called the medical officer in amaloya, who confirmed that a nine-day-old infant,
sleeping in its crib, had been bitten on the foot by an animal the grandmother-the only person
actually to see it-claimed was a lizard. subsequently the foot had become swollen and the infant
had nearly died. the grandmother described the lizard as green with brown stripes. it had bitten
the child several times before the woman frightened it away.
"strange," guitierrez had said.
"no, like all the others," the medical officer replied, adding that he had heard of other biting
incidents: a child in v squez, the next village up the coast, had been bitten while sleeping. and
another in puerta sotrero. all these incidents had occurred in the last two months. all had
involved sleeping children and infants.
such a new and distinctive pattern led guitierrez to suspect the presence of a previously
unknown species of lizard. this was particularly likely to happen in cos

reason. costa rica was becoming deforested, and as jungle species lost their habitats,
they moved to other areas, and sometimes changed behavior as well.
so a new species was perfectly possible. but along with the excitement of a new species was
the worrisome possibility of new diseases. lizards carried viral diseases, including several that
could be transmitted to man. the most serious was central saurian encephalitis, or cse, which
caused a form of sleeping sickness in human beings and horses. guitierrez felt it was important
to find this new lizard, if only to test it for disease.
sitting on the beach, he watched the sun drop lower, and sighed. perhaps tina bowman had
seen a new animal, and perhaps not. certainly guitierrez had not. earlier that morning, he had
taken the air pistol, loaded the clip with ligamine darts, and set out for the beach with high hopes.
but the day was wasted. soon he would have to begin the drive back up the hill from the beach;
he did not want to drive that road in d

arkness.
guitierrez got to his feet and started back up the beach. farther along, he saw the dark shape
of a howler monkey, ambling along the edge of the mangrove swamp. guitierrez moved away,
stepping out toward the water. if there was one howler, there would probably be others in the
trees overhead, arid howlers tended to urinate on intruders.
but this particular howler monkey seemed to be alone, and walking slowly, and pausing
frequently to sit on its haunches. the monkey had something in its mouth. as guitierrez came
closer, he saw it was eating a lizard. the tail and the hind legs drooped from the monkey's jaws.
even from a distance, guitierrez could see the brown st

iving in a protected reserve, stared curiously. he did not run away, even when the first dart
whined harmlessly past him. when the second dart struck deep in the thigh, the howler shrieked in
anger and surprise, dropping the remains of its meal as it fled into the jungle.
guitierrez got to his feet and walked forward. he wasn't worried about the monkey; the
tranquilizer dose was too small to give it anything but a few minutes of dizziness. already he was
thinking of what to do with his new find. guitierrez himself would write the preliminary report, but
the remains would have to be sent back to the united states for final positive identification, of
course. to whom should he send it? the acknowledged expert was edward h. simpson,
emeritus professor of zoology at columbia university, in new york. an elegant older man with
swept-back white hair, simpson was the world's leading authority on lizard taxonomy. probably,
marty thought, he would send his lizard to dr. simpson.

before lunchtime, the lab had its answer: the lizard blood showed no significant reactivity to any
viral or bacterial antigen. they had run toxicity profiles as well, and they had found only one
positive match: the blood was mildly reactive to the venom of the indian king cobra. but such
cross-reactivity was common among reptile species, and dr. stone did not think it noteworthy to
include in the fax his technician sent to dr. martin guitierrez that same evening.
there was never any question about identifying the lizard; that would await the return of dr.
simpson. he was not due back for several weeks, and his secretary asked if the tdl would
please store the lizard fragment in the meantime. dr. stone put it back in the zip-lock bag and
stuck it in the freezer.
martin guitierrez read the fax from the columbia medical center/tropical diseases laboratory. it
was brief: -

uitierrez made two assumptions based on the memo. first, that his identification of the lizard
as a basilisk had been confirmed by scientists at columbia university. and second, that the
absence of communicable disease meant the recent episodes of sporadic lizard bites implied no
serious health hazards for costa rica. on the contrary, he felt his original views were correct:
that a lizard species had been driven from the forest into a new habitat, and was coming into
contact with village people. guitierrez was certain that in a few more weeks the lizards would
settle down and the biting episodes won end.
the tropical rain fell in great drenching sheets, hammering the corrugated roof of the clinic in
bah¡a anasco. it was nearly midnight; power had been lost in the storm, and the midwife elena
morales was working by flashlight when she heard a squeaking, chirping sound. thinking that it
was a rat, she quickly put a compress on the forehead of the mother and went into the next room

the same details, again and again, day after day. the same story.
for a long time, grant thought they must believe he was lying to them, and that there was
something they wanted him to tell, although he could not imagine what it was. yet, in some odd
way, they seemed to be waiting.
finally, he was sitting around the swimming pool of the hotel one afternoon, watching tim and
lex splash, when an american in khakis walked up.
"we've never met," the american said. "my name is marty guitierrez. i'm a researcher here, at
the carara station."
grant said, "you were the one who found the original specimen of the procompsognathus"
that's right, yes." guitierrez sat next to him. "you must be eager to go home."
"yes," grant said. "i have only a few days left to dig before the winter sets in. in montana, you
know, the first snow usually comes in august."
guitierrez said, "is that why the hammond foundation supported northern digs? because
intact genetic material from dinosaurs was more likel

y to be recovered from cold climates?"
"that's what i presume, yes." 
guitierrez nodded. "he was a clever man, mr. hammond."
grant said nothing. guitierrez sat back in the pool chair.
"the authorities won't tell you," guitierrez said finally. "because they are afraid, and perhaps
also resentful of you, for what you have done. but something very peculiar is happening in the
rural regions."
"biting the babies?"
"no, thankfully, that has stopped. but something else. this spring, in the ismaloya section,
which is to the north, some unknown animals ate the crops in a very peculiar manner. they
moved each day, in a straight line-almost as straight as an arrow-from the coast, into the
mountains, into the jungle."

right.
"like a migration," guitierrez said. "wouldn't you say?"
"what crops?" grant said.
"well, it was odd. they would only eat agama beans and soy, and sometimes chickens."
grant said, "foods rich in lysine. what happened to these animals?"
"presumably," guitierrez said, "they entered the jungles. in any case, they have not been
found. of course, it would be difficult to search for them in the jungle. a search party could spend
years in the ismaloya mountains, with nothing to show for it."
"and we are being kept here because . . ."
guitierrez shrugged. "the government is worried. perhaps there are more animals. more
trouble. they are feeling cautious."
"do you think there are more animals?" grant said.
"i can't say. can you?"
"no," grant said. "i can't sa

"but you suspect?"
grant nodded. "possibly there are. yes."
"i agree."
guitierrez pushed up from his chair. he waved to tim and lex, playing in the pool. "probably
they will send the children home," he said. "there is no reason not to do that." he put on his
sunglasses. "enjoy your stay with us, dr. grant. it is a lovely country here."
grant said, "you're telling me we're not going anywhere?"
"none of us is going anywhere, dr. grant," guitierrez said, smiling. and then he turned, and
walked back toward the entrance of the hotel.
