King Lear
Lear's basic flaw at the beginning of the play is that
he values appearances above reality. He wants to be treated as a
king and to enjoy the title, but he doesn't want to fulfill a king's
obligations of governing for the good of his subjects. Similarly,
his test of his daughters demonstrates that he values a flattering
public display of love over real love. He doesn't ask "which of
you doth love us most," but rather, "which of you shall we say doth
love us most?" (1.1.49). Most readers conclude
that Lear is simply blind to the truth, but Cordelia is already
his favorite daughter at the beginning of the play, so presumably
he knows that she loves him the most. Nevertheless, Lear values
Goneril and Regan's fawning over Cordelia's sincere sense of filial
duty.

An important question to ask is whether Lear develops
as a character--whether he learns from his mistakes and becomes a
better and more insightful human being. In some ways the answer
is no: he doesn't completely recover his sanity and emerge as a
better king. But his values do change over the course of
the play. As he realizes his weakness and insignificance in comparison
to the awesome forces of the natural world, he becomes a humble
and caring individual. He comes to cherish Cordelia above everything
else and to place his own love for Cordelia above every other consideration,
to the point that he would rather live in prison with her than rule
as a king again.
