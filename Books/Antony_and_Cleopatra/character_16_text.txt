weak, most weak,
your reconciler! wars 'twixt you twain would be
as if the world should cleave, and that slain men
should solder up the rift.

antony.
when it appears to you where this begins,
turn your displeasure that way; for our faults
can never be so equal that your love
can equally move with them. provide your going;
choose your own company, and command what cost
your heart has mind to.

enobarbus.
how now, friend eros!

eros.
there's strange news come, sir.

enobarbus.
what, man?

eros.
caesar and lepidus have made wars upon pompey.

enobarbus.
this is old: what is the success?

eros.
caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst pompey,
presently denied him rivality; would not let him partake in the
glory of the action: and not resting here, accuses him of letters
he had formerly wrote to pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him:
so the p

eros.
most noble sir, arise; the queen approaches:
her head's declin'd, and death will seize her, but
your comfort makes the rescue.

antony.
i have offended reputation,--
a most unnoble swerving.

eros.
sir, the queen.

antony.
o, whither hast thou led me, egypt? see
how i convey my shame out of thine eyes
by looking back, what i have left behind

that overtopp'd them all. betray'd i am:
o this false soul of egypt! this grave charm,
whose eye beck'd forth my wars and call'd them home;
whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,--
like a right gypsy, hath, at fast and loose,
beguil'd me to the very heart of loss.--

for poor'st diminutives, for doits; and let

my good knave eros, now thy captain is
even such a body: here i am antony;
yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
i made these wars for egypt; and the queen,--
whose heart i thought i had, for she had mine;
which, whilst it was mine, had annex'd unto't
a million moe, now lost,--she, eros, has
pack'd cards with caesar, and false-play'd my glory
unto an enemy's triumph.--
nay, weep not, gentle eros; there is left us
ourselves to end ourselves.--

with ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
the courage of a woman; less noble mind
than she which by her death our caesar tells
'i am conqueror of myself.' thou art sworn, eros,

is come indeed--when i should see behind me

his corrigible neck, his face subdu'd
to penetrative shame; whilst the wheel'd seat
of fortunate caesar, drawn before him, branded
his baseness that ensued?
