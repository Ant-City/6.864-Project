  warwicke. i wonder how the king escap'd our hands?
  pl. while we pursu'd the horsmen of y north,
he slyly stole away, and left his men:
whereat the great lord of northumberland,
whose warlike eares could neuer brooke retreat,
chear'd vp the drouping army, and himselfe.

  warw. and when the king comes, offer him no violence,
vnlesse he seeke to thrust you out perforce

but little thinkes we shall be of her counsaile,
by words or blowes here let vs winne our right

   rich. arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house

   warw. the bloody parliament shall this be call'd,
vnlesse plantagenet, duke of yorke, be king,
and bashfull henry depos'd, whose cowardize
hath made vs by-words to our enemies

i meane to take possession of my right

   warw. neither the king, nor he that loues him best,
the prowdest hee that holds vp lancaster,
dares stirre a wing, if warwick shake his bells.
ile plant plantagenet, root him vp who dares:
resolue thee richard, clayme the english crowne.

he durst not sit there, had your father liu'd.
my gracious lord, here in the parliament
let vs assayle the family of yorke

   henry. ah, know you not the citie fauours them,
and they haue troupes of souldiers at their beck?
