sorders follow us disquietly to our graves. find
out
     this villain, edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it
     carefully. and the noble and true-hearted kent banish'd! his
     offence, honesty! 'tis strange.                       exit.
  edm. this is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we
are
     sick in fortune, often the surfeit of our own behaviour, we
make
     guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as
if
     we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion;
     knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical pre-dominance;
     drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforc'd obedience of
     planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a
divine
     thrusting on. an admirable evasion of whore-master man, to
lay
     his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! my father
     compounded with my mother under the dragon's tail, and my
     nativity was under ursa major, so that it follows i am rough
and

     if there be any good meaning toward you. i have told you
what i
     have seen and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image and
     horror of it. pray you, away!
  edg. shall i hear from you anon?
  edm. i do serve you in this business.
                                                     exit edgar.
     a credulous father! and a brother noble,
     whose nature is so far from doing harms
     that he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty
     my practices ride easy! i see the business.
     let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit;
     all with me's meet that i can fashion fit.

scene iii.
the duke of albany's palace.

enter goneril and [her] steward [oswald].

  gon. did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?
  osw. ay, madam.
  gon. by day and night, he wrongs me! every hour
     he flashes into one gross crime or other
     that sets us all at odds. i'll not endure it.

  osw. he's coming, madam; i hear him.
  gon. put on what weary negligence you please,
     you and your fellows. i'd have it come to question.
     if he distaste it, let him to our sister,
     whose mind and mine i know in that are one,
     not to be overrul'd. idle old man,
     that still would manage those authorities
     that he hath given away! now, by my life,
     old fools are babes again, and must be us'd
     with checks as flatteries, when they are seen abus'd.
     remember what i have said.
  osw. very well, madam.
  gon. and let his knights have colder looks among you.
     what grows of it, no matter. advise your fellows so.
     i would breed from hence occasions, and i shall,
     that i may speak. i'll write straight to my sister
     to hold my very course. prepare for dinner.
                                                         exeunt.

s tale
in
     telling it and deliver a plain message bluntly. that which
     ordinary men are fit for, i am qualified in, and the best of
me
     is diligence.
  lear. how old art thou?
  kent. not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so
old to
     dote on her for anything. i have years on my back
forty-eight.
  lear. follow me; thou shalt serve me. if i like thee no worse
after
     dinner, i will not part from thee yet. dinner, ho, dinner!
     where's my knave? my fool? go you and call my fool hither.

  osw. so please you-                                      exit.
  lear. what says the fellow there? call the clotpoll back.
     [exit a knight.] where's my fool, ho? i think the world's
     asleep.

  lear. ha! say'st thou so?
  knight. i beseech you pardon me, my lord, if i be mistaken; for
     my duty cannot be silent when i think your highness wrong'd.
  lear. thou but rememb'rest me of mine own conception. i have
     perceived a most faint neglect of late, which i have rather
     blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence
     and purpose of unkindness. i will look further into't. but
     where's my fool? i have not seen him this two days.
  knight. since my young lady's going into france, sir, the fool
     hath much pined away.
  lear. no more of that; i have noted it well. go you and tell my
     daughter i would speak with her. [exit knight.] go you, call

  lear. how now, my pretty knave? how dost thou?
  fool. sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.
  kent. why, fool?
  fool. why? for taking one's part that's out of favour. nay, an
thou
     canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold
shortly.
     there, take my coxcomb! why, this fellow hath banish'd two

st his will. if
     thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.- how now,
     nuncle? would i had two coxcombs and two daughters!
  lear. why, my boy?
  fool. if i gave them all my living, i'ld keep my coxcombs
myself.
     there's mine! beg another of thy daughters.
  lear. take heed, sirrah- the whip.
  fool. truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipp'd out,

  fool. mark it, nuncle.

          speak less than thou knowest,
          lend less than thou owest,
          ride more than thou goest,
          learn more than thou trowest,

then 'tis like the breath of an unfeed lawyer- you gave
me
     nothing for't. can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?
  lear. why, no, boy. nothing can be made out of nothing.
  fool. [to kent] prithee tell him, so much the rent of his land
     comes to. he will not believe a fool.
  lear. a bitter fool!
  fool. dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter
     fool and a sweet fool?
  lear. no, lad; teach me.
  fool.   that lord that counsell'd thee
            to give away thy land,
          come place him here by me-
            do thou for him stand.
          the sweet and bitter fool
            will presently appear;
          the one in motley here,
            the other found out there.
  lear. dost thou call me fool, boy?
  fool. all thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast
     born with.
  kent. this is not altogether fool, my lord.
  fool. no, faith; lords and great me

they
     will not let me have all the fool to myself; they'll be
     snatching. give me an egg, nuncle, and i'll give thee two
     crowns.
  lear. what two crowns shall they be?
  fool. why, after i have cut the egg i' th' middle and eat up
the
     meat, the two crowns of the egg. when thou clovest thy crown
i'
     th' middle and gav'st away both parts, thou bor'st thine ass
on
     thy back o'er the dirt. thou hadst little wit in thy bald
crown
     when thou gav'st thy golden one away. if i speak like myself
in
     this, let him be whipp'd that first finds it so.

                  their manners are so apish.

  lear. when were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?
  fool. i have us'd it, nuncle, ever since thou mad'st thy
daughters
     thy mother; for when thou gav'st them the rod, and put'st
down
     thine own breeches,

     [sings]    then they for sudden joy did weep,
                  and i for sorrow sung,
                that such a king should play bo-peep
                  and go the fools among.

     prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool
to
     lie. i would fain learn to lie.

lying;
     and sometimes i am whipp'd for holding my peace. i had
rather be
     any kind o' thing than a fool! and yet i would not be thee,

     in rank and not-to-be-endured riots. sir,
     i had thought, by making this well known unto you,
     to have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful,
     by what yourself, too, late have spoke and done,
     that you protect this course, and put it on
     by your allowance; which if you should, the fault
     would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,
