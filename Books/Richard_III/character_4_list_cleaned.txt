[CHARACTER] - 
 the wife of king edward iv and the mother of the
two young princes (the heirs to the throne) and their older sister,
young elizabeth. after edward's death, [CHARACTER] (also called
lady gray) is at richard's mercy. richard rightly views her as an
enemy because she opposes his rise to power, and because she is intelligent
and fairly strong-willed. elizabeth is part of the woodeville family;
her kinsmen--dorset, rivers, and gray--are her allies in the court.
