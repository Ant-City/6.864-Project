ies ten thick upon her,
     all his whole household; each of which is set
     upon his fellow, and have all their charge,
     when he goes out, when he comes in, examined.

     volp: i will go see her, though but at her window.

     mos: in some disguise, then.

     volp: that is true; i must
     maintain mine own shape still the same: we'll think.

     st. mark's place; a retired corner before corvino's house.

     enter sir politick would-be, and peregrine.

     sir p: sir, to a wise man, all the world's his soil:
     it is not italy, nor france, nor europe,
     that must bound me, if my fates call me forth.
     yet, i protest, it is no salt desire
     of seeing countries, shifting a religion,
     nor any disaffection to the state
     where i was bred, and unto which i owe
     my dearest plots, hath brought me out; much less,
     that idle, antique, stale, gray-headed project
     of knowing men's minds, and manners, with ulysses!

as there want of counsel in the plot:
     but fortune can, at any time, o'erthrow
     the projects of a hundred learned clerks, sir.

     corb [listening]: what's that?

     volt: will't please you, sir, to go along?

     [exit corbaccio, followed by voltore.]

     mos: patron, go in, and pray for our success.

     volp [rising from his couch.]: need makes devotion:
     heaven your labour bless!

     [enter sir politick would-be and peregrine.]

     sir p: i told you, sir, it was a plot: you see
     what observation is! you mention'd me,
     for some instructions: i will tell you, sir,
     (since we are met here in this height of venice,)
     some few perticulars i have set down,
     only for this meridian, fit to be known
     of your crude traveller, and they are these.
     i will not touch, sir, at your phrase, or clothes,
     for they are old.

     per: sir, i have better.

     sir p: pardon,
     i meant, as they are

very turn!

     mos: sir, i can fit you.

     volp: canst thou?

     mos: yes, i know
     one o' the commandadori, sir, so like you;
     him will i straight make drunk, and bring you his habit.

     volp: a rare disguise, and answering thy brain!
     o, i will be a sharp disease unto them.

     mos: sir, you must look for curses--

     volp: till they burst;
     the fox fares ever best when he is curst.

     enter peregrine disguised, and three merchants.

     per: am i enough disguised?

     1 mer: i warrant you.

     per: all my ambition is to fright him only.

     2 mer: if you could ship him away, 'twere excellent.

     3 mer: to zant, or to aleppo?

     per: yes, and have his
     adventures put i' the book of voyages.
     and his gull'd story register'd for truth.
     well, gentlemen, when i am in a while,
     and that you think us warm in our discourse,
     know your approaches.

     1 mer: trust

they'll put you to the rack, you must be sudden.

     sir p: sir, i have an ingine--

     3 mer [within.]: sir politick would-be?

     2 mer [within.]: where is he?

     sir p: that i have thought upon before time.

     per: what is it?

     sir p: i shall ne'er endure the torture.
     marry, it is, sir, of a tortoise-shell,
     fitted for these extremities: pray you, sir, help me.
     here i've a place, sir, to put back my legs,
     please you to lay it on, sir,
     [lies down while peregrine places the shell upon him.]
     --with this cap,
     and my black gloves. i'll lie, sir, like a tortoise,
     'till they are gone.

     per: and call you this an ingine?

     sir p: mine own device--good sir, bid my wife's women
     to burn my papers.

     [exit peregrine.]

     [the three merchants rush in.]

     1 mer: where is he hid?

     3 mer: we must,
     and will sure find him.

     2 mer: which is his study?

     [re-enter peregrine.]

     1 mer: what
     are you, sir?
