Leading Lady - 
      A stereotypical star of the stage, the Leading Lady bristles at the Characters' experiment. Petty and egotistical, she will not support their laughter, protests their vulgar stage tricks, and continually insists that she will deliver a performance superior to theirs. She plays the role of the Step-Daughter.
