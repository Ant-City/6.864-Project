[CHARACTER] - 
      almasy's best friend in the desert. [CHARACTER] is a rational, level-headed man who, like almasy, chose to live in the desert to study the features of the land and report back to the geographical society. unlike almasy, [CHARACTER] includes his own emotional reactions in his writing and reports, and is not shy to describe his amazement at a particular mountain or his wonder at the size of the moon. [CHARACTER] always carries a copy of anna karenina, the famous tale of adultery, but remains ever faithful to his wife back home. [CHARACTER] sees the church as proclaiming a jingoistic pro-war message during world war ii. he takes his own life in the church, and almasy concludes that he "died because of nations."
