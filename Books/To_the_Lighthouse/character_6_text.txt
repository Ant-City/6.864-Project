of it all. there might be some simpler way, some
less laborious way, she sighed. when she looked in the glass and saw her
hair grey, her cheek sunk, at fifty, she thought, possibly she might have
managed things better--her husband; money; his books. but for her own
part she would never for a single second regret her decision, evade
difficulties, or slur over duties. she was now formidable to behold, and
it was only in silence, looking up from their plates, after she had spoken
so severely about charles tansley, that her daughters, prue, nancy,
rose--could sport with infidel ideas which they had brewed for themselves
of a life different from hers; in paris, perhaps; a wilder life; not
always taking care of some man or other; for there was in all their minds
a mute questioning of deference and chivalry, of the bank of england and
the indian empire, of ringed fingers and lace, though to them all there
was something in this of the essence of beauty, which called out the
manliness in their girlish hearts,

 and made them, as they sat at table
beneath their mother's eyes, honour her strange severity, her extreme
courtesy, like a queen's raising from the mud to wash a beggar's dirty
foot, when she admonished them so very severely about that wretched
atheist who had chased them--or, speaking accurately, been invited to
stay with them--in the isle of skye.

"there'll be no landing at the lighthouse tomorrow," said charles tansley,
clapping his hands together as he stood at the window with her husband.
surely, he had said enough. she wished they would both leave her and
james alone and go on talking. she looked at him. he was such a
miserable specimen, the children said, all humps and hollows. he couldn't
play cricket; he poked; he shuffled. he was a sarcastic brute, andrew
said. they knew what he liked best--to be for ever walking up and down,
up and down, with mr. ramsay, and saying who had won this, who had won

balliol," who had buried his light temporarily at bristol or bedford, but
was bound to be heard of later when his prolegomena, of which mr. tansley
had the first pages in proof with him if mr. ramsay would like to see
them, to some branch of mathematics or philosophy saw the light of day.
that was what they talked about.

she could not help laughing herself sometimes. she said, the other day,
something about "waves mountains high." yes, said charles tansley, it
was a little rough. "aren't you drenched to the skin?" she had said.
"damp, not wet through," said mr. tansley, pinching his sleeve, feeling
his socks.

but it was not that they minded, the children said. it was not his face;
it was not his manners. it was him--his point of view. when they talked
about something interesting, people, music, history, anything, even said
it was a fine evening so why not sit out of doors, then what they
complained of about charles tansley was that until he had

indescribable air of expectation, as if she were going to meet some one
round the corner, she told the story; an affair at oxford with some girl;
an early marriage; poverty; going to india; translating a little poetry
"very beautifully, i believe," being willing to teach the boys persian or
hindustanee, but what really was the use of that?--and then lying, as they
saw him, on the lawn.

it flattered him; snubbed as he had been, it soothed him that mrs. ramsay
should tell him this. charles tansley revived. insinuating, too, as she
did the greatness of man's intellect, even in its decay, the subjection of
all wives--not that she blamed the girl, and the marriage had been happy
enough, she believed--to their husband's labours, she made him feel better
pleased with himself than he had done yet, and he would have liked, had
they taken a cab, for example, to have paid the fare. as for her little
bag, might he not carry that? no, no, she said, she always carried that

eight children. stepping through fields of flowers and taking to her

her eyes and the wind in her hair--he had hold of her bag.

"good-bye, elsie," she said, and they walked up the street, she holding
her parasol erect and walking as if she expected to meet some one round
the corner, while for the first time in his life charles tansley felt an
extraordinary pride; a man digging in a drain stopped digging and looked
at her, let his arm fall down and looked at her; for the first time in his
life charles tansley felt an extraordinary pride; felt the wind and the
cyclamen and the violets for he was walking with a beautiful woman. he
had hold of her bag.

mrs. ramsay to soften his voice into some semblance of geniality at least.

 one quick doing after another that it was all ephemeral as
a rainbow--this sound which had been obscured and concealed under the
other sounds suddenly thundered hollow in her ears and made her look up
with an impulse of terror.

they had ceased to talk; that was the explanation. falling in one second
from the tension which had gripped her to the other extreme which, as if
to recoup her for her unnecessary expense of emotion, was cool, amused,
and even faintly malicious, she concluded that poor charles tansley had
been shed. that was of little account to her. if her husband required
sacrifices (and indeed he did) she cheerfully offered up to him charles
tansley, who had snubbed her little boy.

one moment more, with her head raised, she listened, as if she waited for
some habitual sound, some regular mechanical sound; and then, hearing
something rhythmical, half said, half chanted, beginning in the garden, as
her husband beat up and down the terrace, something between a croak and a
song, she was soot

he had a splendid forehead. then, looking up, as her husband passed her
once more, she was relieved to find that the ruin was veiled; domesticity
triumphed; custom crooned its soothing rhythm, so that when stopping
deliberately, as his turn came round again, at the window he bent
quizzically and whimsically to tickle james's bare calf with a sprig of
something, she twitted him for having dispatched "that poor young man,"
charles tansley. tansley had had to go in and write his dissertation,
he said.

"james will have to write his dissertation one of these days," he added
ironically, flicking his sprig.

hating his father, james brushed away the tickling spray with which in a
manner peculiar to him, compound of severity and humour, he teased his
youngest son's bare leg.

were being fused into force, burning and illuminating (quietly though she
sat, taking up her stocking again), and into this delicious fecundity,
this fountain and spray of life, the fatal sterility of the male plunged
itself, like a beak of brass, barren and bare. he wanted sympathy. he
was a failure, he said. mrs. ramsay flashed her needles. mr. ramsay
repeated, never taking his eyes from her face, that he was a failure.
she blew the words back at him. "charles tansley..." she said. but he
must have more than that. it was sympathy he wanted, to be assured of his
genius, first of all, and then to be taken within the circle of life,
warmed and soothed, to have his senses restored to him, his barrenness
made furtile, and all the rooms of the house made full of life--the
drawing-room; behind the drawing-room the kitchen; above the kitchen the
bedrooms; and beyond them the nurseries; they must be furnished, they must
be filled with life.

of mrs. ramsay in her head.) arriving late at night, with a light tap on
one's bedroom door, wrapped in an old fur coat (for the setting of her
beauty was always that--hasty, but apt), she would enact again whatever it

sniffing; mr. bankes saying, "the vegetable salts are lost." all this she
would adroitly shape; even maliciously twist; and, moving over to the

insist that she must, minta must, they all must marry, since in the whole

andrew was with them--what could it mean? except that she had decided,
rightly, mrs. ramsay thought (and she was very, very fond of minta), to
accept that good fellow, who might not be brilliant, but then, thought
mrs. ramsay, realising that james was tugging at her, to make her go on
reading aloud the fisherman and his wife, she did in her own heart
infinitely prefer boobies to clever men who wrote dissertations;
charles tansley, for instance. anyhow it must have happened, one way
or the other, by now.

but she read, "next morning the wife awoke first, and it was just
daybreak, and from her bed she saw the beautiful country lying before
her. her husband was still stretching himself..."

but how could minta say now that she would not have him? not if she
agreed to spend whole afternoons trapesing about the country alone--for
andrew would be off after his crabs--but possibly nancy was with them.

partly to encourage them to be off (for her sympathies were with paul),

"there isn't a cloud anywhere within miles," at which she could feel
little charles tansley, who had followed them out, snigger. but she
did it on purpose. whether nancy was there or not, she could not be
certain, looking from one to the other in her mind's eye.

at the far end was her husband, sitting down, all in a heap, frowning.
what at? she did not know. she did not mind. she could not
understand how she had ever felt any emotion or affection for him. she
had a sense of being past everything, through everything, out of
everything, as she helped the soup, as if there was an eddy--there--
and one could be in it, or one could be out of it, and she was out of
it. it's all come to an end, she thought, while they came in one after
another, charles tansley--"sit there, please," she said--augustus
carmichael--and sat down. and meanwhile she waited, passively, for
some one to answer her, for something to happen. but this is not a
thing, she thought, ladling out soup, that one says.

raising her eyebrows at the discrepancy--that was what she was
thinking, this was what she was doing--ladling out soup--she felt, more
and more strongly, outside that eddy; or as if a shade had fallen, and,
robbed of colour, she saw things truly. the room (she looked ro

that's what has been puzzling me. she took up the salt cellar and put
it down again on a flower pattern in the table-cloth, so as to remind
herself to move the tree.

"it's odd that one scarcely gets anything worth having by post, yet one
always wants one's letters," said mr. bankes.

what damned rot they talk, thought charles tansley, laying down his
spoon precisely in the middle of his plate, which he had swept clean,
as if, lily thought (he sat opposite to her with his back to the window
precisely in the middle of view), he were determined to make sure of
his meals. everything about him had that meagre fixity, that bare
unloveliness. but nevertheless, the fact remained, it was impossible
to dislike any one if one looked at them. she liked his eyes; they
were blue, deep set, frightening.

red as he did when my husband
took him there. are you a good sailor, mr. tansley?" she asked.

mr. tansley raised a hammer: swung it high in air; but realising, as it
descended, that he could not smite that butterfly with such an
instrument as this, said only that he had never been sick in his life.
but in that one sentence lay compact, like gunpowder, that his
grandfather was a fisherman; his father a chemist; that he had worked
his way up entirely himself; that he was proud of it; that he was
charles tansley--a fact that nobody there seemed to realise; but one of
these days every single person would know it. he scowled ahead of him.
he could almost pity these mild cultivated people, who would be blown
sky high, like bales of wool and barrels of apples, one of these days
by the gunpowder that was in him.

"will you take me, mr. tansley?" said lily, quickly, kindly, for, of
course, if mrs. ramsay said to her, as in effect she did, "i am

purposely, however, for she had it on her mind that lily, who had
helped her with mr. tansley, was out of things, she exempted her from
the rest; said "lily anyhow agrees with me," and so drew her in, a
little fluttered, a little startled. (for she was thinking about
love.) they were both out of things, mrs. ramsay had been thinking,
both lily and charles tansley. both suffered from the glow of the
other two. he, it was clear, felt himself utterly in the cold; no
woman would look at him with paul rayley in the room. poor fellow!
still, he had his dissertation, the influence of somebody upon
something: he could take care of himself. with lily it was different.

her little grey dress with her little puckered face and her little
chinese eyes. everything about her was so small. yet, thoug

intelligence, which ran up and down, crossed this way and that, like
iron girders spanning the swaying fabric, upholding the world, so that
she could trust herself to it utterly, even shut her eyes, or flicker
them for a moment, as a child staring up from its pillow winks at the
myriad layers of the leaves of a tree. then she woke up. it was still
being fabricated. william bankes was praising the waverly novels.

he read one of them every six months, he said. and why should that make
charles tansley angry? he rushed in (all, thought mrs. ramsay, because
prue will not be nice to him) and denounced the waverly novels when he
knew nothing about it, nothing about it whatsoever, mrs. ramsay thought,
observing him rather than listening to what he said. she could see how
it was from his manner--he wanted to assert himself, and so it would
always be with him till he got his professorship or married his wife,
and so need not be always saying, "i--i--i." for that was what his

now to listen to what paul rayley was trying to say about books one had
read as a boy. they lasted, he said. he had read some of tolstoi at
school. there was one he always remembered, but he had forgotten the
name. russian names were impossible, said mrs. ramsay. "vronsky," said
paul. he remembered that because he always thought it such a good name
for a villain. "vronsky," said mrs. ramsay; "oh, anna karenina," but
that did not take them very far; books were not in their line. no,
charles tansley would put them both right in a second about books, but
it was all so mixed up with, am i saying the right thing? am i making
a good impression? that, after all, one knew more about him than
about tolstoi, whereas, what paul said was about the thing, simply, not
himself, nothing else. like all stupid people, he had a kind of
modesty too, a consideration for what you were feeling, which, once in
a way at least, she found attractive. now he was thinking, not about
himself, or about tolstoi, but wh

speaking to prue in her own mind, you will be as happy as she is one of
these days. you will be much happier, she added, because you are my

people's daughters. but dinner was over. it was time to go. they
were only playing with things on their plates. she would wait until
they had done laughing at some story her husband was telling. he was
having a joke with minta about a bet. then she would get up.

she liked charles tansley, she thought, suddenly; she liked his laugh.
she liked him for being so angry with paul and minta. she liked his
awkwardness. there was a lot in that young man after all. and lily,
she thought, putting her napkin beside her plate, she always has some
joke of her own. one need never bother about lily. she waited. she
tucked her napkin under the edge of her plate. well, were they done
now? no. that story had led to another story. her husband was in
great spirits tonight, and wishing, she supposed

then one saw mrs. ramsay in the midst of this hubbub standing there with
minta's arm in hers, bethink her, "yes, it is time for that now," and
so make off at once with an air of secrecy to do something alone. and
directly she went a sort of disintegration set in; they wavered about,
went different ways, mr. bankes took charles tansley by the arm and went
off to finish on the terrace the discussion they had begun at dinner
about politics, thus giving a turn to the whole poise of the evening,
making the weight fall in a different direction, as if, lily thought,
seeing them go, and hearing a word or two about the policy of the
labour party, they had gone up on to the bridge of the ship and were
taking their bearings; the change from poetry to politics struck her
like that; so mr. bankes and charles mrs. ramsay going upstairs in

but he wanted to ask her something more. would they go to the lighthouse
tomorrow?

no, not tomorrow, she said, but soon, she promised him; the next fine
day. he was very good. he lay down. she covered him up. but he
would never forget, she knew, and she felt angry with charles tansley,
with her husband, and with herself, for she had raised his hopes. then
feeling for her shawl and remembering that she had wrapped it round the
boar's skull, she got up, and pulled the window down another inch or
two, and heard the wind, and got a breath of the perfectly indifferent
chill night air and murmured good night to mildred and left the room
and let the tongue of the door slowly lengthen in the lock and went

neither of them slept well; they were excitable children, and since he
said things like that about the lighthouse, it seemed to her likely
that he would knock a pile of books over, just as they were going to
sleep, clumsily sweeping them off the table with his elbow. for she
supposed that he had gone upstairs to work. yet he looked so desolate;
yet she would feel relieved when he went; yet she would see that he was
better treated tomorrow; yet he was admirable with her husband; yet his

that was clear. he was reading something that moved him very much. he
was half smiling and then she knew he was controlling his emotion. he
was tossing the pages over. he was acting it--perhaps he was
thinking himself the person in the book. she wondered what book it was.
oh, it was one of old sir walter's she saw, adjusting the shade of her
lamp so that the light fell on her knitting. for charles tansley had
been saying (she looked up as if she expected to hear the crash of
books on the floor above), had been saying that people don't read scott
any more. then her husband thought, "that's what they'll say of me;"
so he went and got one of those books. and if he came to the
conclusion "that's true" what charles tansley said, he would accept it
about scott. (she could see that he was weighing, considering, putting
this with that as he read.) but not about himself. he was always

she murmured, putting the book on the table.

what had happened, she wondered, as she took up her knitting, since she
had seen him alone? she remembered dressing, and seeing the moon;
andrew holding his plate too high at dinner; being depressed by
something william had said; the birds in the trees; the sofa on the
landing; the children being awake; charles tansley waking them with his
books falling--oh, no, that she had invented; and paul having a wash-
leather case for his watch. which should she tell him about?

"they're engaged," she said, beginning to knit, "paul and minta."

"so i guessed," he said. there was nothing very much to be said about
it. her mind was still going up and down, up and down with the poetry;
he was still feeling very vigorous, very forthright, after reading
about steenie's funeral. so they sat silent. then she became aware

certainly she was losing consciousness of outer things. and as she
lost consciousness of outer things, and her name and her personality
and her appearance, and whether mr. carmichael was there or not, her
mind kept throwing up from its depths, scenes, and names, and sayings,
and memories and ideas, like a fountain spurting over that glaring,
hideously difficult white space, while she modelled it with greens and
blues.

charles tansley used to say that, she remembered, women can't paint,
can't write. coming up behind her, he had stood close beside her, a
thing she hated, as she painted her on this very spot. "shag tobacco,"
he said, "fivepence an ounce," parading his poverty, his principles.
(but the war had drawn the sting of her femininity. poor devils, one
thought, poor devils, of both sexes.) he was always carrying a book
about under his arm--a purple book. he "worked." he sat, she
remembered, working in a blaze of sun. a

scene on the beach. one must remember that. it was a windy morning.
they had all gone down to the beach. mrs. ramsay sat down and wrote
letters by a rock. she wrote and wrote. "oh," she said, looking up at
something floating in the sea, "is it a lobster pot? is it an upturned
boat?" she was so short-sighted that she could not see, and then
charles tansley became as nice as he could possibly be. he began
playing ducks and drakes. they chose little flat black stones and sent
them skipping over the waves. every now and then mrs. ramsay looked up
over her spectacles and laughed at them. what they said she could not
remember, but only she and charles throwing stones and getting on very
well all of a sudden and mrs. ramsay watching them. she was highly
conscious of that. mrs. ramsay, she thought, stepping back and screwing

these, when she released faculties that had been on the strain, stood

one with years. the great revelation had never come. the great
revelation perhaps never did come. instead there were little daily
miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark;
here was one. this, that, and the other; herself and charles tansley
and the breaking wave; mrs. ramsay bringing them together; mrs. ramsay
saying, "life stand still here"; mrs. ramsay making of the moment
something permanent (as in another sphere lily herself tried to
make of the moment something permanent)--this was of the nature
of a revelation. in the midst of chaos there was shape; this eternal

shaking) was struck into stability. life stand still here, mrs. ramsay

making her nest in its heart. and this, like all instincts, was a
little distressing to people who did not share it; to mr. carmichael
perhaps, to herself certainly. some notion was in both of them about
the ineffectiveness of action, the supremacy of thought. her going was
a reproach to them, gave a different twist to the world, so that they
were led to protest, seeing their own prepossessions disappear, and
clutch at them vanishing. charles tansley did that too: it was part of
the reason why one disliked him. he upset the proportions of one's
world. and what had happened to him, she wondered, idly stirring the
platains with her brush. he had got his fellowship. he had married;
he lived at golder's green.

she had gone one day into a hall and heard him speaking during the war.
he was denouncing something: he was condemning somebody. he was
preaching brotherly love. and all she felt was how could he love his

her smoking shag ("fivepence an ounce, miss briscoe") and making it his
business to tell her women can't write, women can't paint, not so much
that he believed it, as that for some odd reason he wished it? there
he was lean and red and raucous, preaching love from a platform (there
were ants crawling about among the plantains which she disturbed with
her brush--red, energetic, shiny ants, rather like charles tansley).
she had looked at him ironically from her seat in the half-empty hall,
pumping love into that chilly space, and suddenly, there was the old
cask or whatever it was bobbing up and down among the waves and mrs.
ramsay looking for her spectacle case among the pebbles. "oh, dear!

collar, as if afraid to sanction such exaggeration, but could stand it
