Lady Capulet - 
                Juliet's
mother, Capulet's wife. A woman who herself married young (by her
own estimation she gave birth to Juliet at close to the age of fourteen),
she is eager to see her daughter marry Paris. She is an ineffectual
mother, relying on the Nurse for moral and pragmatic support.
