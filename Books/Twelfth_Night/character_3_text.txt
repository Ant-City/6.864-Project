antonio.
will you stay no longer; nor will you not that i go with you?

sebastian.
by your patience, no. my stars shine darkly over me: the
malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours; therefore i
shall crave of you your leave that i may bear my evils alone: it
were a bad recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.

antonio.
let me know of you whither you are bound.

sebastian.
no, sooth, sir; my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy. but i
perceive in you

so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not
extort from me what i am willing to
keep in; therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express
myself. you must know of me then, antonio, my name is sebastian,
which i called roderigo. my father was that sebastian of
messaline whom i know you have heard of. he left behind him
myself and a sister, both born in an hour. if the heavens had
been pleas'd, would we had so ended! but you, sir, alter'd that;
for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was
my sister drown'd.

antonio.
alas the day!

sebastian.
a lady, sir, though it was said she much resembl'd me, was yet of
many accounted beautiful; but, though i could not, with such
estimable wonder, over-far believe that, yet thus

far i will
boldly publish her: she bore mind that envy could not but call
fair. she is drown'd already, sir, with salt water, though i seem
to drown her remembrance again with more.

antonio.
pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.

sebastian.
o good antonio, forgive me your trouble!

antonio.
if you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant.

sebastian.
if you will not undo what you have done, that is, kill him whom
you have recover'd, desire it not. fare ye well at once; my bosom
is full of kindness, and i am yet so near the manners of my
mother that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
tales of me. i am bound to the count orsino's court; farewell.
[exit.]

antonio.
the gentleness of all the gods go with thee!
i have many enemies in orsino's court,
else would i very shortly see thee there.

hurch. i have dogg'd him, like his murderer. he does obey every
point of the letter that i dropp'd to betray him; he does smile
his face into more lines than is in the new map, with the
augmentation of the indies: you have not seen such a thing as 't
is.  i  can hardly forbear hurling things at him. i know my lady
will strike him; if she do, he'll smile, and take 't for a great
favour.

sebastian.
i would not by my will have troubled you;
but, since you make your pleasure of your pains,
i will no further chide you.

antonio.
i could not stay behind you: my desire,
more sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;
and not all love to see you, though so much
as might have drawn one to a longer voyage,
but jealousy what might befall your travel,
being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,
unguided and unfriended, often prove
rough and unhospita

ble. my willing love,

set forth in your pursuit.

sebastian.
my kind antonio,
i can no other answer make but thanks,
and thanks, and ever thanks; too oft good turns
are shuffl'd off with such uncurrent pay:
but, were my worth as is my conscience firm,
you should find better dealing. what's to do?
shall we go see the reliques of this town?

antonio.
to-morrow, sir; best first go see your lodging.

sebastian.
i am not weary, and 't is long to night;
i pray you, let us satisfy our eyes
with the memorials and the things of fame
that do renown this city.

antonio.
would you'd pardon me;
i do not without danger walk these streets.
once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleys
i did some service; of such note indeed,
that, were i ta'en here, it would scarce be answer'd.

sebastian.
belike you slew great number of his people.

antonio.
th' offence is not of such a bloody nature;

might well have given us bloody argument.
it might have since been answer'd in repaying
what we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,
most of our city did: only myself stood out;
for which, if i be lapsed in this place,
i shall pay dear.

sebastian.
do not then walk too open.

antonio.
it doth not fit me. hold, sir, here's my purse.
in the south suburbs, at the elephant,
is best to lodge. i will bespeak our diet,
whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
with viewing of the town; there shall you have me.

sebastian.
why i your purse?

antonio.
haply your eye shall light upon some toy
you have desire to purchase; and your store,
i think, is not for idle markets, sir.

most venerable worth, did i devotion.

thou hast, sebastian, done good feature shame.

i could not find him at the elephant:
yet there he was; and there i found this credit,
that he did range the town to seek me out.
his counsel now might do me golden service;
for though my soul disputes well with my sense,
that this may be some error, but no madness,
