Richard - 
      A younger brother of Edward and George, Richard is a fierce supporter of the Yorks' claim to the throne. Most noted for his physical deformities, including a hump back, lame leg, and shriveled arm, Richard takes his physical deformity as proof that he will not succeed with women or in the world of the court. Therefore, he decides that the only thing for him is to gain the throne. Yet there are many ahead of him in line to the crown, who he must eliminate along the way, performing the role of a good brother and subject while secretly behaving with bloodthirsty abandon. Killing Henry, Richard declares himself severed from a world of family and brotherhood; he stands alone in his quest for the crown. One of the most compelling characters in Shakespeare's oeuvre, Richard has greater command of language than most other characters, and he has the best speeches. Richard's deformities raise many questions; does he use his deformity as an excuse for his behavior, or is his body an outward manifestation of his ambition and his evil nature?
