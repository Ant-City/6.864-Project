and as each and all of them were warmed without by the sun, so each
had a private little sun for her soul to bask in; some dream, some
affection, some hobby, at least some remote and distant hope which,
though perhaps starving to nothing, still lived on, as hopes will.
they were all cheerful, and many of them merry.

they came round by the pure drop inn, and were turning out of the
high road to pass through a wicket-gate into the meadows, when one of
the women said--

"the load-a-lord!  why, tess durbeyfield, if there isn't thy father
riding hwome in a carriage!"

a young member of the band turned her head at the exclamation.
she was a fine and handsome girl--not handsomer than some others,
possibly--but her mobile peony mouth and large innocent eyes added
eloquence to colour and shape.  she wore a red ribbon in her hair,
and was the only one of the white company who could boast of such
a pronounced adornment.  as she looked round durbeyfield was seen
moving along the road in a chaise belonging to

oment her eyes grew moist, and her glance
drooped to the ground.  perceiving that they had really pained her
they said no more, and order again prevailed.  tess's pride would not
allow her to turn her head again, to learn what her father's meaning
was, if he had any; and thus she moved on with the whole body to the
enclosure where there was to be dancing on the green.  by the time
the spot was reached she has recovered her equanimity, and tapped her
neighbour with her wand and talked as usual.

tess durbeyfield at this time of her life was a mere vessel of
emotion untinctured by experience.  the dialect was on her tongue
to some extent, despite the village school: the characteristic
intonation of that dialect for this district being the voicing
approximately rendered by the syllable ur, probably as rich an
utterance as any to be found in human speech.  the pouted-up deep red
mouth to which this syllable was native had hardly as yet settled
into its definite shape, and her lower lip had a way of thrust

"better than none.  'tis melancholy work facing and footing it to one
of your own sort, and no clipsing and colling at all.  now, pick and
choose."

"'ssh--don't be so for'ard!" said a shyer girl.

the young man, thus invited, glanced them over, and attempted some
discrimination; but, as the group were all so new to him, he could
not very well exercise it.  he took almost the first that came to
hand, which was not the speaker, as she had expected; nor did it
happen to be tess durbeyfield.  pedigree, ancestral skeletons,
monumental record, the d'urberville lineaments, did not help tess in
her life's battle as yet, even to the extent of attracting to her a
dancing-partner over the heads of the commonest peasantry.  so much
for norman blood unaided by victorian lucre.

the name of the eclipsing girl, whatever it was, has not been handed
down; but she was envied by all as the first who enjoyed the luxury
of a masculine partner that evening.  yet such was the force of
example that t

the gate while no intruder was in the way, now dropped in quickly,
and soon the couples became leavened with rustic youth to a marked
extent, till at length the plainest woman in the club was no longer
compelled to foot it on the masculine side of the figure.

the church clock struck, when suddenly the student said that he must
leave--he had been forgetting himself--he had to join his companions.
as he fell out of the dance his eyes lighted on tess durbeyfield,
whose own large orbs wore, to tell the truth, the faintest aspect of
reproach that he had not chosen her.  he, too, was sorry then that,
owing to her backwardness, he had not observed her; and with that in
his mind he left the pasture.

on account of his long delay he started in a flying-run down the lane
westward, and had soon passed the hollow and mounted the next rise.
he had not yet overtaken his brothers, but he paused to get breath,
and looked back.  he could see the white figures of the

maiden with whom he had not danced.  trifling as the matter was, he
yet instinctively felt that she was hurt by his oversight.  he wished
that he had asked her; he wished that he had inquired her name.  she
was so modest, so expressive, she had looked so soft in her thin
white gown that he felt he had acted stupidly.

however, it could not be helped, and turning, and bending himself to
a rapid walk, he dismissed the subject from his mind.

as for tess durbeyfield, she did not so easily dislodge the incident
from her consideration.  she had no spirit to dance again for a long
time, though she might have had plenty of partners; but ah! they did
not speak so nicely as the strange young man had done.  it was not
till the rays of the sun had absorbed the young stranger's retreating
figure on the hill that she shook off her temporary sadness and
answered her would-be partner in the affirmative.

she remained with her comrades till dusk, and participated with

"very well said, tess!" observed her father sententiously.

"who said i had such a thought?" asked joan.

"i fancy it is in your mind, mother.  but i'll go."

rising early next day she walked to the hill-town called shaston,
and there took advantage of a van which twice in the week ran from
shaston eastward to chaseborough, passing near trantridge, the parish
in which the vague and mysterious mrs d'urberville had her residence.

tess durbeyfield's route on this memorable morning lay amid the
north-eastern undulations of the vale in which she had been born, and
in which her life had unfolded.  the vale of blackmoor was to her the
world, and its inhabitants the races thereof.  from the gates and
stiles of marlott she had looked down its length in the wondering
days of infancy, and what had been mystery to her then was not
much less than mystery to her now.  she had seen daily from her
chamber-window towers, villages, faint white mansions

 outside the
immediate boundaries of the estate.

everything on this snug property was bright, thriving, and well kept;
acres of glass-houses stretched down the inclines to the copses at
their feet.  everything looked like money--like the last coin issued
from the mint.  the stables, partly screened by austrian pines
and evergreen oaks, and fitted with every late appliance, were
as dignified as chapels-of-ease.  on the extensive lawn stood an
ornamental tent, its door being towards her.

simple tess durbeyfield stood at gaze, in a half-alarmed attitude,
on the edge of the gravel sweep.  her feet had brought her onward to
this point before she had quite realized where she was; and now all
was contrary to her expectation.

"i thought we were an old family; but this is all new!" she said, in
her artlessness.  she wished that she had not fallen in so readily
with her mother's plans for "claiming kin," and had endeavoured to
gain assistance nearer home.

stoke d'urberville took her back to the lawn and into the tent, where
he left her, soon reappearing with a basket of light luncheon, which
he put before her himself.  it was evidently the gentleman's wish not
to be disturbed in this pleasant _tête-à-tête_ by the servantry.

"do you mind my smoking?" he asked.

"oh, not at all, sir."

he watched her pretty and unconscious munching through the skeins of
smoke that pervaded the tent, and tess durbeyfield did not divine,
as she innocently looked down at the roses in her bosom, that there
behind the blue narcotic haze was potentially the "tragic mischief"
of her drama--one who stood fair to be the blood-red ray in the
spectrum of her young life.  she had an attribute which amounted
to a disadvantage just now; and it was this that caused alec
d'urberville's eyes to rivet themselves upon her.  it was a
luxuriance of aspect, a fulness of growth, which made her appear more
of a woman than she really

was.  she had inherited the feature from
her mother without the quality it denoted.  it had troubled her mind
occasionally, till her companions had said that it was a fault which
time would cure.

she soon had finished her lunch.  "now i am going home, sir," she
said, rising.

"and what do they call you?" he asked, as he accompanied her along
the drive till they were out of sight of the house.

"tess durbeyfield, down at marlott."

"and you say your people have lost their horse?"

"i--killed him!" she answered, her eyes filling with tears as she
gave particulars of prince's death.  "and i don't know what to do
for father on account of it!"

"i must think if i cannot do something.  my mother must find a berth
for you.  but, tess, no nonsense about 'd'urberville';--'durbeyfield'
only, you know--quite another name."

"i wish for no better, sir," said she with something of dignity.

the crest of the first hill, chatting compliments to tess as they
went, the cart with her box being left far behind.  rising still, an
immense landscape stretched around them on every side; behind, the
green valley of her birth, before, a gray country of which she knew
nothing except from her first brief visit to trantridge.  thus they
reached the verge of an incline down which the road stretched in a
long straight descent of nearly a mile.

ever since the accident with her father's horse tess durbeyfield,
courageous as she naturally was, had been exceedingly timid on
wheels; the least irregularity of motion startled her.  she began to
get uneasy at a certain recklessness in her conductor's driving.

"you will go down slow, sir, i suppose?" she said with attempted
unconcern.

d'urberville looked round upon her, nipped his cigar with the tips of
his large white centre-teeth, and allowed his lips to smile slowly of
themselves.

"why, tess," he answered, after another whiff or two, "it isn't a

"i don't know much of her yet, sir."

"you'll find her so; she must be, to make you learn to whistle to her
bullfinches.  i am rather out of her books just now, but you will be
quite in favour if you treat her live-stock well.  good morning.  if
you meet with any difficulties and want help here, don't go to the
bailiff, come to me."


it was in the economy of this _régime_ that tess durbeyfield had
undertaken to fill a place.  her first day's experiences were fairly
typical of those which followed through many succeeding days.  a
familiarity with alec d'urberville's presence--which that young man
carefully cultivated in her by playful dialogue, and by jestingly
calling her his cousin when they were alone--removed much of her
original shyness of him, without, however, implanting any feeling
which could engender shyness of a new and tenderer kind.  but she was
more pliable under his han

her mother was subdued.

"i thought if i spoke of his fond feelings and what they might lead
to, you would be hontish wi' him and lose your chance," she murmured,
wiping her eyes with her apron.  "well, we must make the best of it,
i suppose.  'tis nater, after all, and what do please god!"

the event of tess durbeyfield's return from the manor of her bogus
kinsfolk was rumoured abroad, if rumour be not too large a word for
a space of a square mile.  in the afternoon several young girls of
marlott, former schoolfellows and acquaintances of tess, called to
see her, arriving dressed in their best starched and ironed, as
became visitors to a person who had made a transcendent conquest (as
they supposed), and sat round the room looking at her with great
curiosity.  for the fact that it was this said thirty-first co

her gown; and as the day wears on
its feminine smoothness becomes scarified by the stubble and bleeds.

at intervals she stands up to rest, and to retie her disarranged
apron, or to pull her bonnet straight.  then one can see the oval
face of a handsome young woman with deep dark eyes and long heavy
clinging tresses, which seem to clasp in a beseeching way anything
they fall against.  the cheeks are paler, the teeth more regular,
the red lips thinner than is usual in a country-bred girl.

it is tess durbeyfield, otherwise d'urberville, somewhat changed--the
same, but not the same; at the present stage of her existence living
as a stranger and an alien here, though it was no strange land that
she was in.  after a long seclusion she had come to a resolve to
undertake outdoor work in her native village, the busiest season of
the year in the agricultural world having arrived, and nothing that
she could do within the house being so remunerative for the time as
harvesting in the fields.

the face of tess flushed slightly, but still she did not pause.

the eldest of the comers, a girl who wore a triangular shawl, its
corner draggling on the stubble, carried in her arms what at first
sight seemed to be a doll, but proved to be an infant in long
clothes.  another brought some lunch.  the harvesters ceased working,
took their provisions, and sat down against one of the shocks.  here
they fell to, the men plying a stone jar freely, and passing round a
cup.

tess durbeyfield had been one of the last to suspend her labours.
she sat down at the end of the shock, her face turned somewhat away
from her companions.  when she had deposited herself a man in a
rabbit-skin cap, and with a red handkerchief tucked into his belt,
held the cup of ale over the top of the shock for her to drink.  but
she did not accept his offer.  as soon as her lunch was spread she
called up the big girl, her sister, and took the baby of her, who,
glad to be relieved of the burden, went away to

of her own death, when all these charms would have disappeared; a day
which lay sly and unseen among all the other days of the year, giving
no sign or sound when she annually passed over it; but not the less
surely there.  when was it?  why did she not feel the chill of each
yearly encounter with such a cold relation?  she had jeremy taylor's
thought that some time in the future those who had known her would
say: "it is the ----th, the day that poor tess durbeyfield died"; and
there would be nothing singular to their minds in the statement.  of
that day, doomed to be her terminus in time through all the ages, she
did not know the place in month, week, season or year.

almost at a leap tess thus changed from simple girl to complex woman.

on a thyme-scented, bird-hatching morning in may, between two and
three years after the return from trantridge--silent, reconstructive
years for tess durbeyfield--she left her home for the second time.

having packed up her luggage so that it could be sent to her later,
she started in a hired trap for the little town of stourcastle,
through which it was necessary to pass on her journey, now in a
direction almost opposite to that of her first adventuring.  on the
curve of the nearest hill she looked back regretfully at marlott and
her father's house, although she had been so anxious to get away.

her kindred dwelling there would probably continue their d

there was, it might be said, the energy of her mother's unexpended
family, as well as the natural energy of tess's years, rekindled
after the experience which had so overwhelmed her for the time. let
the truth be told--women do as a rule live through such humiliations,
and regain their spirits, and again look about them with an
interested eye.  while there's life there's hope is a conviction not
so entirely unknown to the "betrayed" as some amiable theorists would
have us believe.

tess durbeyfield, then, in good heart, and full of zest for life,
descended the egdon slopes lower and lower towards the dairy of her
pilgrimage.

the marked difference, in the final particular, between the rival
vales now showed itself.  the secret of blackmoor was best discovered
from the heights around; to read aright the valley before her it was
necessary to descend into its midst.  when tess had accomplished this
feat she found herself to be standing on a carpeted level, which
stretched to the east and wes

amongst ourselves, though we need not own it to other folks.  i would
just marry 'n to-morrow!"

"so would i--and more," murmured izz huett.

"and i too," whispered the more timid retty.

the listener grew warm.

"we can't all marry him," said izz.

"we shan't, either of us; which is worse still," said the eldest.
"there he is again!"

they all three blew him a silent kiss.

"why?" asked retty quickly.

"because he likes tess durbeyfield best," said marian, lowering her
voice.  "i have watched him every day, and have found it out."

there was a reflective silence.

"but she don't care anything for 'n?" at length breathed retty.

"well--i sometimes think that too."

"but how silly all this is!" said izz huett impatiently.  "of course
he won't marry any one of us, or tess either--a gentleman's son,
who's going to be a great landowner and farmer abroad!  more likely
to ask us to come wi'en as farm-hands at so much a year!"

against her knee, went round to where they stood.  soon the sound of
old pretty's milk fizzing into the pail came through the hedge, and
then angel felt inclined to go round the corner also, to finish off a
hard-yielding milcher who had strayed there, he being now as capable
of this as the dairyman himself.

all the men, and some of the women, when milking, dug their foreheads
into the cows and gazed into the pail.  but a few--mainly the younger
ones--rested their heads sideways.  this was tess durbeyfield's
habit, her temple pressing the milcher's flank, her eyes fixed on
the far end of the meadow with the quiet of one lost in meditation.
she was milking old pretty thus, and the sun chancing to be on the
milking-side, it shone flat upon her pink-gowned form and her white
curtain-bonnet, and upon her profile, rendering it keen as a cameo
cut from the dun background of the cow.

she did not know that clare had followed her round, and that he sat
under his cow watching her.  the stillness of her he

dairyman crick, as he sat down to breakfast next day, with a riddling
gaze round upon the munching men and maids. "now, just who mid ye
think?"

one guessed, and another guessed.  mrs crick did not guess, because
she knew already.

"well," said the dairyman, "'tis that slack-twisted 'hore's-bird of a
feller, jack dollop.  he's lately got married to a widow-woman."

"not jack dollop?  a villain--to think o' that!" said a milker.

the name entered quickly into tess durbeyfield's consciousness, for
it was the name of the lover who had wronged his sweetheart, and had
afterwards been so roughly used by the young woman's mother in the
butter-churn.

"and had he married the valiant matron's daughter, as he promised?"
asked angel clare absently, as he turned over the newspaper he was
reading at the little table to which he was always banished by mrs
crick, in her sense of his gentility.

"not he, sir.  never meant to," replied the dairyman. "as i say, 'tis

ession was the discovery
that no "mrs clare" had ever been heard of by the cottagers or by
the farmer himself, though tess was remembered well enough by her
christian name.  his name she had obviously never used during their
separation, and her dignified sense of their total severance was
shown not much less by this abstention than by the hardships she had
chosen to undergo (of which he now learnt for the first time) rather
than apply to his father for more funds.

from this place they told him tess durbeyfield had gone, without due
notice, to the home of her parents on the other side of blackmoor,
and it therefore became necessary to find mrs durbeyfield.  she had
told him she was not now at marlott, but had been curiously reticent
as to her actual address, and the only course was to go to marlott
and inquire for it.  the farmer who had been so churlish with tess
was quite smooth-tongued to clare, and lent him a horse and man to
drive him towards marlott, the gig he had arrived in being sent back
to
