"my old pie," he said.

"oh, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, dads, dads, dads!"

she drew him into the salon, where the family waited, a boy and girl his daughter's age, his sister-in-law and her husband. he greeted marion with his voice pitched carefully to avoid either feigned enthusiasm or dislike, but her response was more frankly tepid, though she minimized her expression of unalterable distrust by directing her regard toward his child. the two men clasped hands in a friendly way and lincoln peters rested his for a moment on charlie's shoulder.

the room was warm and comfortably american. the three children moved intimately about, playing through the yellow oblongs that led to other rooms; the cheer of six o'clock spoke in the eager smacks of the fire and the sounds of french activity in the kitchen. but charlie did not relax; his heart sat up rigidly in his body and he drew confidence from his daughter, who from time to time came close to him, holding in her arms the doll he had brought.

he lunched with lincoln peters at griffons, trying to keep down his exultation.

"there's nothing quite like your own child," lincoln said. "but you understand how marion feels too."

"there's another thing." lincoln hesitated. "while you and helen were tearing around europe throwing money away, we were just getting along. i didn't touch any of the prosperity because i never got ahead enough to carry anything but my insu
