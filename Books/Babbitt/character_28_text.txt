and this morning babbitt was too disquieted to entertain her with items
from mechanics' liens, mortgages recorded, and contracts awarded. he
rose. as he looked at her his eyebrows seemed shaggier than usual.
suddenly:

"yes, maybe--kind of shame to not keep in touch with folks like the
mckelveys. we might try inviting them to dinner, some evening. oh,
thunder, let's not waste our good time thinking about 'em! our little
bunch has a lot liver times than all those plutes. just compare a real
human like you with these neurotic birds like lucile mckelvey--all
highbrow talk and dressed up like a plush horse! you're a great old
girl, hon.!"

he covered his betrayal of softness with a complaining: "say, don't let
tinka go and eat any more of that poison nutfudge. for heaven's sake,

fe and you at the house,"
said mckelvey, much less vaguely.

then the chairman's voice, that prodigious voice which once had roused
them to cheer defiance at rooters from ohio or michigan or indiana,
whooped, "come on, you wombats! all together in the long yell!" babbitt
felt that life would never be sweeter than now, when he joined with paul
riesling and the newly recovered hero, mckelvey, in:

baaaaaattle-ax get an ax, bal-ax, get-nax, who, who? the u.! hooroo!

the babbitts invited the mckelveys to dinner, in early december, and the
mckelveys not only accepted but, after changing the date once or twice,
actually came.

the babbitts somewhat thoroughly discussed the details of the dinner,
from the purchase of a bottle of champagne to the number of salted
almonds to be placed before each person. especially did they mention the
matter of the other guests. to the last babbitt held out for giving
paul riesling the benefit of being with the mckelveys. "good old charley
would like paul and ve

wives.

neither angus nor maxwell belonged to the elks or to the athletic club;
neither of them had ever called babbitt "brother" or asked his opinions
on carburetors. the only "human people" whom she invited, babbitt
raged, were the littlefields; and howard littlefield at times became so
statistical that babbitt longed for the refreshment of gunch's, "well,
old lemon-pie-face, what's the good word?"

immediately after lunch mrs. babbitt began to set the table for the
seven-thirty dinner to the mckelveys, and babbitt was, by order, home at
four. but they didn't find anything for him to do, and three times mrs.
babbitt scolded, "do please try to keep out of the way!" he stood in the
door of the garage, his lips drooping, and wished that littlefield or
sam doppelbrau or somebody would come along and talk to him. he saw ted
sneaking about the corner of the house.

"what's the matter, old man?" said babbitt.

"is that you, thin, owld one? gee, ma certainly is on the warpath!
i told her rone and i w

to-night, and she bit me. she says i got to take a bath, too. but, say,
the babbitt men will be some lookers to-night! little theodore in a
dress-suit!"

"the babbitt men!" babbitt liked the sound of it. he put his arm about
the boy's shoulder. he wished that paul riesling had a daughter, so that
ted might marry her. "yes, your mother is kind of rouncing round, all
right," he said, and they laughed together, and sighed together, and
dutifully went in to dress.

the mckelveys were less than fifteen minutes late.

babbitt hoped that the doppelbraus would see the mckelveys' limousine,
and their uniformed chauffeur, waiting in front.

the dinner was well cooked and incredibly plentiful, and mrs. babbitt
had brought out her grandmother's silver candlesticks. babbitt worked
hard. he was good. he told none of the jokes he wanted to tell. he
listened to the others. he started maxwell off with a resounding, "let's
hear about your trip to the yellowstone." he was laudatory,

lunch--said they wanted to have us up to the house for dinner before
long."

she achieved, "oh, it's just been one of those quiet evenings that are
often so much more enjoyable than noisy parties where everybody talks at
once and doesn't really settle down to-nice quiet enjoyment."

but from his cot on the sleeping-porch he heard her weeping, slowly,
without hope.

for a month they watched the social columns, and waited for a return
dinner-invitation.

as the hosts of sir gerald doak, the mckelveys were headlined all the
week after the babbitts' dinner. zenith ardently received sir gerald
(who had come to america to buy coal). the newspapers interviewed him
on prohibition, ireland, unemployment, naval aviation, the rate of
exchange, tea-drinking versus whisky-drinking, the psychology of
american women, and daily life as lived by english county families. sir
gerald seemed to have heard of all those topics. the mckelveys gave him
a singhalese dinner, and miss elnora pearl bates, society edi

e folks that, just because they happen to lay up a big wad, go

to address 'em so's to make 'em feel at home!"

that evening, as he was driving home, he passed mckelvey's limousine
and saw sir gerald, a large, ruddy, pop-eyed, teutonic englishman whose
dribble of yellow mustache gave him an aspect sad and doubtful. babbitt
drove on slowly, oppressed by futility. he had a sudden, unexplained,
and horrible conviction that the mckelveys were laughing at him.

he betrayed his depression by the violence with which he informed his
wife, "folks that really tend to business haven't got the time to waste
on a bunch like the mckelveys. this society stuff is like any other
hobby; if you devote yourself to it, you get on. but i like to have a
chance to visit with you and the children instead of all this idiotic
chasing round."

they did not speak of the mckelveys again.

it was a shame, at this worried time, to have to think about

e? think of him 'phoning me, instead of his
wife sitting down and writing us a regular bid! well, i guess
we're stuck for it. that's the trouble with all this class-brother
hooptedoodle."

he accepted overbrook's next plaintive invitation, for an evening two
weeks off. a dinner two weeks off, even a family dinner, never seems
so appalling, till the two weeks have astoundingly disappeared and
one comes dismayed to the ambushed hour. they had to change the date,
because of their own dinner to the mckelveys, but at last they gloomily
drove out to the overbrooks' house in dorchester.

it was miserable from the beginning. the overbrooks had dinner at
six-thirty, while the babbitts never dined before seven. babbitt
permitted himself to be ten minutes late. "let's make it as short as
possible. i think we'll duck out quick. i'll say i have to be at the
office extra early to-morrow," he planned.

the overbrook house was depressing. it was the second story of a wooden
two-family dwelling; a place of baby

there, and thought they were friends of ours!"

for a week they worried, "we really ought to invite ed and his wife,
poor devils!" but as they never saw the overbrooks, they forgot them,
and after a month or two they said, "that really was the best way, just
to let it slide. it wouldn't be kind to them to have them here. they'd
feel so out of place and hard-up in our home."

they did not speak of the overbrooks again.

the certainty that he was not going to be accepted by the mckelveys made
babbitt feel guilty and a little absurd. but he went more regularly to
the elks; at a chamber of commerce luncheon he was oratorical regarding
the wickedness of strikes; and again he saw himself as a prominent
citizen.

his clubs and associations were food comfortable to his spirit.

of a decent man in zenith it was required that he should belong to
one, preferably two or three, of the innumerous "lodges" and
prosperity-boosting lunch-clubs; to the rotarians, the kiwanis, or the
boosters;

ink you'll like the cigars there." babbitt did
like the cigars. he also liked the office, which was distinguished from
other offices only by the spirited change of the familiar wall-placard
to "this is the lord's busy day." chum frink came in, then william w.
eathorne.

mr. eathorne was the seventy-year-old president of the first state bank
of zenith. he still wore the delicate patches of side-whiskers which had
been the uniform of bankers in 1870. if babbitt was envious of the
smart set of the mckelveys, before william washington eathorne he was
reverent. mr. eathorne had nothing to do with the smart set. he was
above it. he was the great-grandson of one of the five men who founded
zenith, in 1792, and he was of the third generation of bankers. he could
examine credits, make loans, promote or injure a man's business. in his
presence babbitt breathed quickly and felt young.

the reverend dr. drew bounced into the room and flowered into speech:

"i've asked you gentlemen to stay so i can put a p

what most folks here don't know is that senny is the bosom pal of some

that lord wycombe is one of the biggest guns in england--well, doak or

"oh! do you know sir gerald? the one that was here, at the mckelveys'?"

"know him? well, say, i know him just well enough so we call each other
george and jerry, and we got so pickled together in chicago--"

"that must have been fun. but--" she shook a finger at him. "--i can't
