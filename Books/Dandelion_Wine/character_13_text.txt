hot air. "steering lever! foot rest! overhead parasol! here, in tote, is the green 
machine!" 

in the dark attic the ladies shuddered, remembering, eyes shut. 
"why didn't we stab him with our darning needles!" 
"shh! listen." 

someone knocked on the front door downstairs. after a time the knocking stopped. 
they saw a woman cross the yard and enter the house next door. 

"only lavinia nebbs, come with an empty cup, to borrow sugar, i guess." 

"hold me, i'm afraid." 

they shut their eyes. the memory-play began again. an old straw hat on an iron trunk 
was suddenly flourished, it seemed, by the man from gumport falls. 

"thanks, i will have some iced tea." you could hear the cool liquid shock his stomach, 
in the silence. then he turned his gaze upon the old ladies like a doctor with a small 
light, looking into their eyes and nostrils and mouths. "ladies, i know you're both

black courthouse, and the real moon rising in vanilla whiteness from the dark east. 

in the drugstore fans whispered in the high ceiling. in the rococo shade of porches, a 
few invisible people sat. cigars glowed pink, on occasion. screen doors whined their 
springs and slammed. on the purple bricks of the summer-night streets, douglas 
spaulding ran; dogs and boys followed after.

"hi, miss lavinia!" 

the boys loped away. waving after them quietly, lavinia nebbs sat all alone with a tall 
cool lemonade in her white i fingers, tapping it to her lips, sipping, waiting. 

"here i am, lavinia." 

she turned and there was francine, all in snow white, at the bottom steps of the 
porch, in the smell of zinnias and hibiscus. 

lavinia nebbs locked her front door and, leaving her lemonade glass half empty on the 
porch, said, "it's a fine night for the movie." 

they walked down the street. 

"where you going, girls?" cried miss fern and miss roberta from their

there was a great moving hum, a bumbling and murmuring of creature, insect, or plant 
life. it smelled like a greenhouse, of secret vapors and ancient, washed shales and 
quicksands. and always the black dynamo humming, with sparkles like great electricity 
where fireflies moved on the air. 

"it won't be me coming back through this old ravine tonight late, so darned late; it'll 
be you, lavinia, you down the steps and over the bridge and maybe the lonely one 
there." 

"bosh!" said lavinia nebbs. 

"it'll be you alone on the path, listening to your shoes, not me. you all alone on the 
way back to your house. lavinia, don't you get lonely living in that house?" 

"old maids love to live alone." lavinia pointed at the hot shadowy path leading down 
into the dark. "let's take the short cut." 



"i'm afraid!"

"get home!" cried francine. 
he did not hear. 

"you!" shrieked francine. "get home, get out of this place, you hear? get home, get 
home, get home!"

douglas jerked his head, stared at them as if they were i. not there. his mouth 
moved. he gave a bleating sound. then, ■ silently, he whirled about and ran. he ran 
silently up the distant hills into the warm darkness. 

francine sobbed and cried again and, doing this, walked on with lavinia nebbs. 



"there you are! i thought you ladies'd never come!" helen greer stood tapping her 
foot atop her porch steps. "you're only an hour late, that's all. what happened?" 

"we—" started francine. 

lavinia clutched her arm tight. "there was a commotion. somebody found elizabeth 
ramsell in the ravine." 

"dead? was she— dead?" 

lavinia nodded. helen gasped and put her hand to her throat. "who found her?" 
lavinia held francine's wrist firmly. "we don't know."

face was set and pale, like all the faces they had seen on the half-empty streets. "for 
eating in the show," said lavinia as the druggist weighed out a nickel's worth of the 
green candy with a silver shovel. 

"you sure look pretty tonight, ladies. you looked cool this afternoon, miss lavinia, 
when you was in for a chocolate soda. so cool and nice that someone asked after you." 

"oh?" 

"man sitting at the counter— watched you walk out. said to me, 'say, who's that?' why, 
that's lavinia nebbs, prettiest maiden lady in town, i said, 'she's beautiful,' he said. 
'where does she live?' "here the druggist paused uncomfortably. 

"you didn't!" said francine. "you didn't give him her address, i hope? you didn't!" 

"i guess i didn't think. i said, 'oh, over on park street, you know, near the ravine. ' a 
casual remark. but now, tonight, them finding the body, i heard a minute ago, i thought, 
my god, what've i done!" he handed over the package, much too full.

"the police are home with their covers up over their ears." 

"let's just say i'm enjoying myself, precariously, but safely. if there was any real 
chance of anything happening to me, i'd stay here with you, you can be sure of that." 

"maybe part of you doesn't want to live anymore." 

"you and francine. honestly!" 

"i feel so guilty. i'll be drinking some hot cocoa just as you reach the ravine bottom 
and walk on the bridge." 

"drink a cup for me. good night." 

lavinia nebbs walked alone down the midnight street, down the late summer-night 
silence. she saw houses with the dark windows and far away she heard a dog barking. in 
five minutes, she thought, i'll be safe at home. in five minutes i'll be phoning silly little 
francine. i'll—"

she heard the man's voice. 
a man's voice singing far away among the trees. 
"oh, give me a june night, the moonlight and you . . ." 
she walked a little faster.

a step and an echo.

weakly she asked of the ravine, "officer kennedy, is that you?" 
the crickets were still. 

the crickets were listening. the night was listening to her. for a change, all of the far 
summer-night meadows and close summer-night trees were suspending motion; leaf, 
shrub, star, and meadow grass ceased their particular tremors and were listening to 
lavinia nebbs's heart. and perhaps a thousand miles away, across locomotive-lonely 
country, in an empty way station, a single traveler reading a dim newspaper under a 
solitary naked bulb, might raise up his head, listen, and think, what's that? and decide, 
only a woodchuck, surely, beating on a hollow log. but it was lavinia nebbs, it was most 
surely the heart of lavinia nebbs.

"don't take it so hard, charlie." 

"well, what're we going to talk about now? it's no use talking the lonely one if he 
ain't even alive! it's not scary anymore!" 

"don't know about you, charlie," said tom. "i'm going back to summer's ice house 
and sit in the door and pretend he's alive and get cold all up and down my spine." 

"that's cheating." 

"you got to take your chills where you can find them, charlie." 

douglas did not listen to tom and charlie. he looked at lavinia nebbs's house and 
spoke, almost to himself. 

"i was there last night in the ravine. i saw it. i saw everything. on my way home i cut 
across here. i saw that lemonade glass right on the porch rail, half empty. thought i'd 
like to drink it. like to drink it, i thought. i was in the ravine and i was here, right in the 
middle of it all." 

tom and charlie, in turn, ignored douglas. 

"for that matter," said tom. "i don't really think the lonely one is dead." 

"you were here this morning when the am

"sure," said tom. 

"well, that was the lonely one, dumb! read the papers! after ten long years 
escaping, old lavinia nebbs up and stabbed him with a handy pair of sewing scissors. i 
wish she'd minded her own business." 

"you want she'd laid down and let him squeeze her windpipe?" 

"no, but the least she could've done is gallop out of the house and down the street 
screaming 'lonely one! lonely one!' long enough to give him a chance to beat it. this 
town used to have some good stuff in it up until about twelve o'clock last night. from 
here on, we're vanilla junket." 

"let me say it for the last time, charlie;

"yeah," said tom, and stopped, suddenly thoughtful. 

"tom, you're a pal, you got a real brain. none of us would've saved the day this way. 
the summer was sure going bad up to this very minute. you got your thumb in the dike 
just in time. august won't be a total loss. hey, kids!" 

and charlie was off, waving his arms, yelling. 

tom stood on the sidewalk in front of lavinia nebbs' house, his face pale. 
"my gosh!" he whispered. "what've i gone and done now!" 
he turned to douglas. 

"i say, doug, what've i gone and done now?" 
douglas was staring at the house. his lips moved. 

"i was there, last night, in the ravine. i saw elizabeth ramsell. it came by here last 
night on the way home. i saw the lemonade glass there on the rail. just last night it was. 
i could drink that, i thought ... i could drink that . . ."
