                the
daughter of capulet and lady capulet. a beautiful thirteen-year-old
girl, [CHARACTER] begins the play as a naive child who has thought little
about love and marriage, but she grows up quickly upon falling in
love with romeo, the son of her family's great enemy. because she
is a girl in an aristocratic family, she has none of the freedom
romeo has to roam around the city, climb over walls in the middle
of the night, or get into swordfights. nevertheless, she shows amazing
courage in trusting her entire life and future to romeo, even refusing
to believe the worst reports about him after he gets involved in
a fight with her cousin. [CHARACTER]'s closest friend and confidant is
her nurse, though she's willing to shut the nurse out of her life
the moment the nurse turns against romeo.
