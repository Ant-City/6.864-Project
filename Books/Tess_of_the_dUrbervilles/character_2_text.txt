kinswoman."

"yes, you ought, perhaps, to ha' done that," snored sir john.

joan durbeyfield always managed to find consolation somewhere: "well,
as one of the genuine stock, she ought to make her way with 'en, if
she plays her trump card aright.  and if he don't marry her afore he
will after.  for that he's all afire wi' love for her any eye can
see."

"what's her trump card?  her d'urberville blood, you mean?"

"no, stupid; her face--as 'twas mine."

having mounted beside her, alec d'urberville drove rapidly along
the crest of the first hill, chatting compliments to tess as they
went, the cart with her box being left far behind.  rising still, an
immense landscape stretched around them on every side; behind, the
green valley of her birth, before, a gray country of which she knew
nothing except from her first brief visit to trantridge.  thus they
reached the verge of an incline down which the road stretched in a
long straight descent of nearly a mile.

you meet with any difficulties and want help here, don't go to the

it was in the economy of this _r√©gime_ that tess durbeyfield had
undertaken to fill a place.  her first day's experiences were fairly
typical of those which followed through many succeeding days.  a
familiarity with alec d'urberville's presence--which that young man
carefully cultivated in her by playful dialogue, and by jestingly
calling her his cousin when they were alone--removed much of her
original shyness of him, without, however, implanting any feeling
which could engender shyness of a new and tenderer kind.  but she was
more pliable under his hands than a mere companionship would have
made her, owing to her unavoidable dependence upon his mother, and,
through that lady's comparative helplessness, upon him.

she thought she heard a rustling behind the bed.  the old lady was
not present, and turning round the girl had an impression that
the toes of a pair of boots were visible below the fringe of the
curtains.  thereupon her whistling became so disjointed that the
listener, if such there were, must have discovered her suspicion of
his presence.  she searched the curtains every morning after that,
but never found anybody within them.  alec d'urberville had evidently
thought better of his freak to terrify her by an ambush of that kind.

every village has its idiosyncrasy, its constitution, often its own
code of morality.  the levity of some of the younger women in and
about trantridge was marked, and was perhaps symptomatic of the
choice spirit who ruled the slopes in that vicinity.  the place had
also a more abiding defect; it drank hard.  the staple conversation
on the farms around was on the uselessness of saving money; and

aused the mishap; she happened
also to be his recently married wife, in which assortment there was
nothing unusual at trantridge as long as any affection remained
between wedded couples; and, indeed, it was not uncustomary in their
later lives, to avoid making odd lots of the single people between
whom there might be a warm understanding.

he beckoned to her, and she reluctantly retreated towards him.

"well, my beauty, what are you doing here?"

she was so tired after her long day and her walk that she confided
her trouble to him--that she had been waiting ever since he saw her
to have their company home, because the road at night was strange to
her.  "but it seems they will never leave off, and i really think i
will wait no longer."

"certainly do not.  i have only a saddle-horse here to-day; but come

tess was indignant and ashamed.  she no longer minded the loneliness
of the way and the lateness of the hour; her one object was to get
away from the whole crew as soon as possible.  she knew well enough
that the better among them would repent of their passion next day.
they were all now inside the field, and she was edging back to rush
off alone when a horseman emerged almost silently from the corner of
the hedge that screened the road, and alec d'urberville looked round
upon them.

"what the devil is all this row about, work-folk?" he asked.

the explanation was not readily forthcoming; and, in truth, he did
not require any.  having heard their voices while yet some way off he
had ridden creepingly forward, and learnt enough to satisfy himself.

tess was standing apart from the rest, near the gate.  he bent over
towards her.  "jump up behind me," he whispered, "and we'll get shot
of the screaming cats in a jiffy!"

she felt almost ready to faint,

having buttoned the overcoat round her shoulders he plunged into the
webs of vapour which by this time formed veils between the trees.
she could hear the rustling of the branches as he ascended the
adjoining slope, till his movements were no louder than the hopping
of a bird, and finally died away.  with the setting of the moon the
pale light lessened, and tess became invisible as she fell into
reverie upon the leaves where he had left her.

in the meantime alec d'urberville had pushed on up the slope to clear
his genuine doubt as to the quarter of the chase they were in.  he
had, in fact, ridden quite at random for over an hour, taking any
turning that came to hand in order to prolong companionship with her,
and giving far more attention to tess's moonlit person than to any
wayside object.  a little rest for the jaded animal being desirable,
he did not hasten his search for landmarks.  a clamber over the
hill into the adjoining vale brought him to the fence of a h

she said that she did not wish him to drive her further, and they
stopped just under the clump of trees.  d'urberville alighted, and
lifted her down bodily in his arms, afterwards placing her articles
on the ground beside her.  she bowed to him slightly, her eye just
lingering in his; and then she turned to take the parcels for
departure.

alec d'urberville removed his cigar, bent towards her, and said--

"you are not going to turn away like that, dear!  come!"

"if you wish," she answered indifferently.  "see how you've mastered
me!"

she thereupon turned round and lifted her face to his, and remained
like a marble term while he imprinted a kiss upon her cheek--half
perfunctorily, half as if zest had not yet quite died out.  her eyes
vaguely rested upon the remotest trees in the lane while the kiss was
given, as though she were nearly unconscious

her acquaintance with alec d'urberville and its results, murmuring
the words without flinching, and with her eyelids drooping down.

explanations were done.  tess's voice throughout had hardly risen

roaching that well-known form--so strangely
accoutred as the methodist--the one personage in all the world she
wished not to encounter alone on this side of the grave.

there was not much time, however, for thought or elusion, and she
yielded as calmly as she could to the necessity of letting him
overtake her.  she saw that he was excited, less by the speed of his
walk than by the feelings within him.

"tess!" he said.

she slackened speed without looking round.

"tess!" he repeated.  "it is i--alec d'urberville."

she then looked back at him, and he came up.

"i see it is," she answered coldly.

"well--is that all?  yet i deserve no more!  of course," he added,
with a slight laugh, "there is something of the ridiculous to your
eyes in seeing me like this.  but--i must put up with that. ...  i
heard you had gone away; nobody knew where.  tess, you wonder why i

a mere point it advanced to the shape of a ninepin, and was soon
perceived to be a man in black, arriving from the direction of
flintcomb-ash.  the man at the slicer, having nothing else to do with
his eyes, continually observed the comer, but tess, who was occupied,
did not perceive him till her companion directed her attention to his
approach.

it was not her hard taskmaster, farmer groby; it was one in a
semi-clerical costume, who now represented what had once been the
free-and-easy alec d'urberville.  not being hot at his preaching
there was less enthusiasm about him now, and the presence of the
grinder seemed to embarrass him.  a pale distress was already on
tess's face, and she pulled her curtained hood further over it.

d'urberville came up and said quietly--

"i want to speak to you, tess."

"you have refused my last request, not to come near me!" said she.

"yes, but i have a good reason."

"well, tell it."

"it is more serious than you may think."

"o alec d'urberville! what does this mean?  what have i done!"

"done?" he said, with a soulless sneer in the word.  "nothing
intentionally.  but you have been the means--the innocent means--of
my backsliding, as they call it.  i ask myself, am i, indeed, one of
those 'servants of corruption' who, 'after they have escaped the
pollutions of the world, are again entangled therein and overcome'--
whose latter end is worse than their beginning?"  he laid his hand on
her shoulder.  "tess, my girl, i was on the way to, a

 away her appetite; and marian was thinking of inducing tess
to descend by a ladder on the further side of the stack when the
gentleman came forward and looked up.

tess uttered a short little "oh!"  and a moment after she said,
quickly, "i shall eat my dinner here--right on the rick."

sometimes, when they were so far from their cottages, they all did
this; but as there was rather a keen wind going to-day, marian and
the rest descended, and sat under the straw-stack.

the newcomer was, indeed, alec d'urberville, the late evangelist,
despite his changed attire and aspect.  it was obvious at a glance
that the original _weltlust_ had come back; that he had restored
himself, as nearly as a man could do who had grown three or four
years older, to the old jaunty, slapdash guise under which tess
had first known her admirer, and cousin so-called.  having decided
to remain where she was, tess sat down among the bundles, out of
sight of the ground, and began her meal; till, by-and-by, she heard
footsteps on the

in the afternoon the farmer made it known that the rick was to be
finished that night, since there was a moon by which they could see
to work, and the man with the engine was engaged for another farm on
the morrow.  hence the twanging and humming and rustling proceeded
with even less intermission than usual.

it was not till "nammet"-time, about three o-clock, that tess raised
her eyes and gave a momentary glance round.  she felt but little
surprise at seeing that alec d'urberville had come back, and was
standing under the hedge by the gate.  he had seen her lift her
eyes, and waved his hand urbanely to her, while he blew her a kiss.
it meant that their quarrel was over.  tess looked down again, and
carefully abstained from gazing in that direction.

thus the afternoon dragged on.  the wheat-rick shrank lower, and the
straw-rick grew higher, and the corn-sacks were carted away.  at six
o'clock the wheat-rick was about shoulder-high from the ground.  but
the unthreshed she

by degrees the freshest among them began to grow cadaverous and
saucer-eyed.  whenever tess lifted her head she beheld always the
great upgrown straw-stack, with the men in shirt-sleeves upon it,
against the gray north sky; in front of it the long red elevator
like a jacob's ladder, on which a perpetual stream of threshed straw
ascended, a yellow river running uphill, and spouting out on the top
of the rick.

she knew that alec d'urberville was still on the scene, observing
her from some point or other, though she could not say where.  there
was an excuse for his remaining, for when the threshed rick drew
near its final sheaves a little ratting was always done, and men
unconnected with the threshing sometimes dropped in for that
performance--sporting characters of all descriptions, gents with
terriers and facetious pipes, roughs with sticks and stones.

but there was another hour's work before the layer of live rats at
the base of

accompanied by 'liza-lu and the boy, she again ascended the little
lane which secluded the church from the townlet.  as soon as they got
into the street they beheld a man on horseback gazing up and down.
"ah--i'm looking for you!" he said, riding up to them.  "this is
indeed a family gathering on the historic spot!"

it was alec d'urberville.  "where is tess?" he asked.

personally joan had no liking for alec.  she cursorily signified the
direction of the church, and went on, d'urberville saying that he
would see them again, in case they should be still unsuccessful in
their search for shelter, of which he had just heard.  when they had
gone, d'urberville rode to the inn, and shortly after came out on
foot.

in the interim tess, left with the children inside the bedstead,
remained talking with them awhile, till, seeing that no more

ly turned to withdraw, passing near an altar-tomb, the
oldest of them all, on which was a recumbent figure.  in the dusk she
had not noticed it before, and would hardly have noticed it now but
for an odd fancy that the effigy moved.  as soon as she drew close
to it she discovered all in a moment that the figure was a living
person; and the shock to her sense of not having been alone was so
violent that she was quite overcome, and sank down nigh to fainting,
not, however, till she had recognized alec d'urberville in the form.

he leapt off the slab and supported her.

"i saw you come in," he said smiling, "and got up there not to
interrupt your meditations.  a family gathering, is it not, with
these old fellows under us here?  listen."

he stamped with his heel heavily on the floor; whereupon there arose
a hollow echo from below.

"that shook them a bit, i'll warrant!" he continued.  "and you

benvill lane soon stretched before him, its hedges and trees purple
with buds; but he was looking at other things, and only recalled
himself to the scene sufficiently to enable him to keep the way.  in
something less than an hour-and-a-half he had skirted the south of
the king's hintock estates and ascended to the untoward solitude of
cross-in-hand, the unholy stone whereon tess had been compelled by
alec d'urberville, in his whim of reformation, to swear the strange
oath that she would never wilfully tempt him again.  the pale and
blasted nettle-stems of the preceding year even now lingered nakedly
in the banks, young green nettles of the present spring growing from
their roots.

thence he went along the verge of the upland overhanging the other
hintocks, and, turning to the right, plunged into the bracing
calcareous region of flintcomb-ash, the address from which she had
written to him in one of the letter
