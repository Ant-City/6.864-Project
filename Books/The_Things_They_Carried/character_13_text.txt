just  the  opposite.  what  i  remember  more  than  anything  is  the  man's
willful, almost ferocious silence. in all that time together, all those hours,
he never asked the obvious questions: why was i there? why alone? why
so  preoccupied?  if  elroy  was  curious  about  any  of  this,  he  was  careful
never to put it into words.

my hunch, though, is that he already knew. at least the basics. after
all, it was 1968, and guys were burning draft cards, and canada was just
a boat ride away. elroy berdahl was no hick. his bedroom, i remember,
was cluttered with books and newspapers. he killed me at the scrabble
board,  barely  concentrating,  and  on  those  occasions  when  speech  was
necessary he had a way of compressing large thoughts into small, cryptic
packets of language. one evening, just at sunset, he pointed up at an owl
circling over the violet-lighted forest to the west. "hey, o'brien," he said.
"there's jesus." the man was sharp—he didn't miss much. those razor
eyes.  now  and  th

that i'd slipped out of my own skin, hovering a few feet away while some
poor yo-yo with my name and face tried to make his way toward a future
he didn't understand and didn't want. even now i can see myself as i was
then.  it's  like  watching  an  old  home  movie:  i'm  young  and  tan  and  fit.
i've  got  hair—lots  of  it.  i  don't  smoke  or  drink.  i'm  wearing  faded  blue
jeans and a white polo shirt. i can see myself sitting on elroy berdahl's
dock near dusk one evening, the sky a bright shimmering pink, and i'm
finishing  up  a  letter  to  my  parents  that  tells  what  i'm  about  to  do  and
why i'm doing it and how sorry i am that i'd never found the courage to
talk to them about it. i ask them not to be angry. i try to explain some of
my  feelings,  but  there  aren't  enough  words,  and  so  i  just  say  that  it's  a
thing  that  has  to  be  done.  at  the  end  of  the  letter  i  talk  about  the
vacations  we  used

rying.
now,  perhaps,  you  can  understand  why  i've  never  told  this  story
before.  it's  not  just  the  embarrassment  of  tears.  that's  part  of  it,  no
doubt,  but  what  embarrasses  me  much  more,  and  always  will,  is  the
paralysis that took my heart. a moral freeze: i couldn't decide, i couldn't
act,  i  couldn't  comport  myself  with  even  a  pretense  of  modest  human
dignity.

all i could do was cry. quietly, not bawling, just the chest-chokes.
at the rear of the boat elroy berdahl pretended not to notice. he held
a  fishing  rod  in  his  hands,  his  head  bowed  to  hide  his  eyes.  he  kept
humming  a  soft,  monotonous  little  tune.  everywhere,  it  seemed,  in  the
trees and water and sky, a great worldwide sadness came pressing down
on me, a crushing sorrow, sorrow like i had never known it before. and
what  was  so  sad,  i  realized,  was  that  canada  had  become  a  pitiful
fantasy.  silly  and  hopeless.  it  was  no  longer  a  possibility.  right  then,
