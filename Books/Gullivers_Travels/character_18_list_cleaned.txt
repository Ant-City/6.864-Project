[CHARACTER] - 
                the
master of the antelope, the
ship on which gulliver embarks for the south seas at the outset
of his first journey, in 1699. when the antelope sinks, gulliver
is washed ashore on lilliput. no details are given about the personality
of prichard, and he is not important in gulliver's life or in the
unfolding of the novel's plot. that gulliver takes pains to name
him accurately reinforces our impression that he is obsessive about
facts but not always reliable in assessing overall significance.
