no matter which way us change up, he want to sit next to squeak.

while me and shug sleeping and he driving, he tell squeak all about life in north memphis, tennessee. i can't half sleep
for him raving bout clubs and clothes and forty-nine brands of beer. talking so much bout stuff to drink make me have to
pee. then us have to find a road going off into the bushes to relieve ourselves.

mr. try to act like he don't care i'm going.

you'll be back, he say. nothing up north for nobody like you. shug got talent, he say. she can sing. she got spunk, he say.
she can talk to anybody. shug got looks, he say. she can stand

let me go with you, i say. i can press your clothes, do your hair. it would be like old times, when you was singing at
harpo's.

she say, naw. she can act like she not bored in front of a audience of strangers, a lot of them white, but she wouldn't
have the nerve to try to act in front of me.

besides, she say. you not my maid. i didn't bring you to memphis to be that. i brought you here to love you and help you
get on your feet.

and now she off on the road for two weeks, and me and grady and squeak rattle round the house trying to get our stuff
together. squeak been going round to a lot of clubs and grady been taking her. plus he seem to be doing a little farming
out back the house.

i sit in the dining room making pants after pants. i got pants now in every color and size under the sun. since us started
making pants down home, i ain't been able to stop. i change the cloth, i change the print, i change the waist, i change the
pocket. i change the hem, i change the fullness of the leg. i m

ardly wrinkle at all, and the little figures in the cloth always look perky and
bright. and they full round the ankle so if she want to sing in 'em and wear 'em sort of like a long dress, she can. plus,
once shug put them on, she knock your eyes out.

miss celie, she say. you is a wonder to behold.

i duck my head. she run round the house looking at herself in mirrors. no matter how she look, she look good.

you know how it is when you don't have nothing to do, i say, when she brag to grady and squeak bout her pants. i sit
here thinking bout how to make a living and before i know it i'm off on another pair pants.

by now squeak see a pair she like. oh, miss celie, she say. can i try on those?

she put on a pair the color of sunset. orangish with a little grayish fleck. she come back out looking just fine. grady look
at her like he could eat her up.

shug finger the pieces of cloth i got hanging on everything. it all soft, flowing, rich and catch the light. this a far cry from
that stiff army
