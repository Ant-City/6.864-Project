mr. frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury, and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life. his coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved.
now, upon his fatherâ€™s marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a most proper attention, that the visit should take place. there was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when mrs. perry drank tea with mrs. and miss bates, or when mrs. and miss bates returned the visit. now was the time for mr. frank churchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion. for a few days, every morning visit in highbury included some mention of the handsome letter mrs. weston had received. â€œi suppose you have heard of the handsome letter mr. frank churchill has written to mrs. weston? i understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed. mr. woodhouse t

real, long-standing regard brought the westons and mr. knightley; and by mr. elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of mr. woodhouseâ€™s drawing-room, and the smiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.
after these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were mrs. and miss bates, and mrs. goddard, three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield, and who were fetched and carried home so often, that mr. woodhouse thought it no hardship for either james or the horses. had it taken place only once a year, it would have been a grievance.
mrs. bates, the widow of a former vicar of highbury, was a very old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. she lived with her single daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the regar

such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might constrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things, to say:
â€œmrs. bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome. serle understands boiling an egg better than any body. i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you seeâ€”one of our small eggs will not hurt you. miss bates, let emma help you to a little bit of tartâ€”a very little bit. ours are all apple-tarts. you need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here. i do not advise the custard. mrs. godd

 boys and girls, but a single woman, of good fortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else. and the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first; for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper. those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross. this does not apply, however, to miss bates; she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very much to the taste of every body, though single and though poor. poverty certainly has not contracted her mind: i really believe, if she had only a shilling in the world, she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a great charm.â€

â€œoh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that i have hardly any uneasiness about it. either bathing has been of the greatest service to her, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of mr. wingfieldâ€™s, which we have been applying at times ever since august.â€
â€œit is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of use to herâ€”and if i had known you were wanting an embrocation, i would have spoken toâ€”

they were just approaching the house where lived mrs. and miss bates. she determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers. there was always sufficient reason for such an attention; mrs. and miss bates loved to be called on, and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as rather negligent in that respect, and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts.

the house belonged to people in business. mrs. and miss bates occupied the drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized apartment, which was every thing to them, the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to give up her place to miss woodhouse, and her more active, talking daughter, almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after mr. woodhouseâ€™s h

this she had been prepared for when she entered the house; but meant, having once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst all the mistresses and misses of highbury, and their card-parties. she had not been prepared to have jane fairfax succeed mr. elton; but he was actually hurried off by miss bates, she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the coles, to usher in a letter from her niece.
â€œoh! yesâ€”mr. elton, i understandâ€”certainly as to dancingâ€”mrs. cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at bath wasâ€”mrs. cole was so kind as to sit some time with us, talking of jane; for as soon as she came in, she began inquiring after her, jane is so very great a favourite there. whenever she is with us, mrs. cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough; and i must say that jane

all this spoken extremely fast obliged miss bates to stop for breath; and emma said something very civil about the excellence of miss fairfaxâ€™s handwriting.
â€œyou are extremely kind,â€ replied miss bates, highly gratified; â€œyou who are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself. i am sure there is nobodyâ€™s praise that could give us so much pleasure as miss woodhouseâ€™s. my mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know. maâ€™am,â€ addressing her, â€œdo you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say about janeâ€™s handwr

and emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it. she was pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming very rude, of making her escape from jane fairfaxâ€™s letter, and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse, when miss bates turned to her again and seized her attention.
â€œmy motherâ€™s deafness is very trifling you seeâ€”just nothing at all. by only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over, she is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. but it is very remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me. jane speaks so distinct! however, she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at my motherâ€™s time of lifeâ€

â€œbut, in spite of all her friendsâ€™ urgency, and her own wish of seeing ireland, miss fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and mrs. bates?â€
â€œyesâ€”entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and colonel and mrs. campbell think she does quite right, just what they should recommend; and indeed they particularly wish her to try her native air, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately.â€

and not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded. she regained the streetâ€”happy in this, that though much had been forced on her against her will, though she had in fact heard the whole substance of jane fairfaxâ€™s letter, she had been able to escape the letter itself.

â€œi hope every body had a pleasant evening,â€ said mr. woodhouse, in his quiet way. â€œi had. once, i felt the fire rather too much; but then i moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me. miss bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she always is, though she speaks rather too quick. however, she is very agreeable, and mrs. bates too, in a different way. i like old friends; and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a very well-behaved young lady indeed. she must have found the evening agreeable, mr. knightley, because she had emma.â€

mr. knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express; and before he could make any reply, mr. woodhouse, whose thoughts were on the batesâ€™s, saidâ€”
â€œit is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined! a great pity indeed! and i have often wishedâ€”but it is so little one can venture to doâ€”small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommonâ€”now we have killed a porker, and emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg; it is very small and delicateâ€”hartfield pork is not like any other porkâ€”but still it is porkâ€”and, my dear emma, unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks, nicely fried, as ours

he had time only to say,
â€œno, not at randalls; i have not been near randalls,â€ when the door was thrown open, and miss bates and miss fairfax walked into the room. full of thanks, and full of news, miss bates knew not which to give quickest. mr. knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment, and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him.
â€œoh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? my dear miss woodhouseâ€”i come quite over-powered. such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork! you are too bountiful! have you heard the news? mr. elton is going to be married.â€

â€œmr. elton going to be married!â€ said emma, as soon as she could speak. â€œhe will have every bodyâ€™s wishes for his happiness.â€
â€œhe is very young to settle,â€ was mr. woodhouseâ€™s observation. â€œhe had better not be in a hurry. he seemed to me very well off as he was. we were always glad to see him at hartfield.â€

janeâ€™s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her.

the shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes, when in came harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the â€œoh! miss woodhouse, what do you think has happened!â€ which instantly burst forth,

â€œas you are going farther on business, sir, i will take the opportunity of paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other, and therefore may as well be paid now. i have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours, (turning to emma,) a lady residing in or near highbury; a family of the name of fairfax. i shall have no difficulty, i suppose, in finding the house; though fairfax, i believe, is not the proper nameâ€”i should rather say barnes, or bates. do you know any family of that name?â€
â€œto be sure we do,â€ cried his father; â€œmrs. batesâ€”we passed her houseâ€”i saw miss bates at the window. true, true, you are acquainted with miss fairfax; i remember you knew her at weymouth, and a fine girl she is. call upon her, by all means.â€

mr. frank churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could, and his father gave his hearty support by calling out, â€œmy good friend, this is quite unnecessary; frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it, and as to mrs. batesâ€™s, he may get there from the crown in a hop, step, and jump.â€
they were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one, and a graceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave. emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, and could now engage to think of them all at randalls any hour of the day, with full confidence in their comfort.

at last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the crown; and being now almost facing the house where the bateses lodged, emma recollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him if he had paid it.
â€œyes, oh! yesâ€â€”he replied; â€œi was just going to mention it. a very successful visit:â€”i saw all the three ladies; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint. if the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. as it was, i was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. ten minutes would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all

she meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at mr. coleâ€™s; and without being able to forget that among the failings of mr. elton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with mr. cole.
her fatherâ€™s comfort was amply secured, mrs. bates as well as mrs. goddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty, before she left the house, was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her power, by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine, for whatever unwilling self-denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal.â€”she had provided a plentiful

they were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of the early was frank churchill. in he walked, the first and the handsomest; and after paying his compliments en passant to miss bates and her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle, where sat miss woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her, would not sit at all. emma divined what every body present must be thinking. she was his object, and every body must perceive it. she introduced him to her friend, miss smith, and, at convenient moments afterwards, heard what each thought of the other. â€œhe had never seen so lovely a face, and was delighted with her naivete.â€ and she, â€œonly to be sure it

before he could return to his chair, it was taken by mrs. weston.
â€œthis is the luxury of a large party,â€ said she:â€”â€œone can get near every body, and say every thing. my dear emma, i am longing to talk to you. i have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like yourself, and i must tell them while the idea is fresh. do you know how miss bates and her niece came here?â€
â€œhow?â€”they were invited, were not they?â€
â€œoh! yesâ€”but how they were conveyed hither?â€”the manner of their coming?â€
â€œthey walked, i conclude. how else could they come?â€
â€œvery true.â€”well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have jane fairfax walking home again, late at night, and cold as the nights are now. and as i looked at her, though i never saw her appear to more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, and wou

ld therefore be particularly liable to take cold. poor girl! i could not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as mr. weston came into the room, and i could get at him, i spoke to him about the carriage. you may guess how readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, i made my way directly to miss bates, to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home; for i thought it would be making her comfortable at once. good soul! she was as grateful as possible, you may be sure. â€˜nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!â€™â€”but with many, many thanksâ€”â€˜there was no occasion to trouble us, for mr. knightleyâ€™s carriage had brought, and was to take them home again.â€™ i was quite surprized;â€”very glad, i am sure; but really quite surprized. such a very kind attention

is a very humane one; and this, considering jane fairfaxâ€™s ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;â€”and for an act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr. knightley. i know he had horses to-dayâ€”for we arrived together; and i laughed at him about it, but he said not a word that could betray.â€
â€œwell,â€ said mrs. weston, smiling, â€œyou give him credit for more simple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do; for while miss bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and i have never been able to get it out again. the more i think of it, the more probable it appears. in short, i have made a match between mr. knightley and jane fairfax. see the consequence of keeping you company!â€”what do you say to it?â€
â€œmr. knightley and jane fairfax!â€ exclaimed emma. â€œdear mrs. weston, how could you think of such a thing?â€”mr. knightley!â€”mr. knightley must not marry!â€”you would not have little henry cut out from

â€œnay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very well know.â€
â€œbut the imprudence of such a match!â€
â€œi am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.â€
â€œi see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than what you mention. his good-nature, his humanity, as i tell you, would be quite enough to account for the horses. he has a great regard for the bateses, you know, independent of jane fairfaxâ€”and is always glad to shew them attention. my dear mrs. weston, do not take to match-making. you do it very ill. jane fairfax mistress of the abbey!â€”oh! no, no;â€”every feeling revolts. for his own sake, i would not have him do so mad a thing.â€
â€œimprudent, if you pleaseâ€”but not mad. excepting inequality of fortune, and perhaps a little disparity of age, i can see nothing unsuitable.â€

â€œnonsense! he does not care about jane fairfax. in the way of love, i am sure he does not. he would do any good to her, or her family; butâ€”â€
â€œwell,â€ said mrs. weston, laughing, â€œperhaps the greatest good he could do them, would be to give jane such a respectable home.â€
â€œif it would be good to her, i am sure it would be evil to himself; a very shameful and degrading connexion. how would he bear to have miss bates belonging to him?â€”to have her haunting the abbey, and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying jane?â€”â€˜so very kind and obliging!â€”but he always had been such a very kind neighbour!â€™ and then fly off, through half a sentence, to her motherâ€™s old petticoat. â€˜not that it was such a very old petticoat eitherâ€”for still it would last a great whileâ€”and, indeed, she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong.â€™â€

another song, however, was soon begged for. â€œone more;â€”they would not fatigue miss fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more.â€ and frank churchill was heard to say, â€œi think you could manage this without effort; the first part is so very trifling. the strength of the song falls on the second.â€
mr. knightley grew angry.
â€œthat fellow,â€ said he, indignantly, â€œthinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice. this must not be.â€ and touching miss bates, who at that moment passed nearâ€”â€œmiss bates, are you mad, to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner? go, and interfere. they have no mercy on her.â€
miss bates, in her real anxiety for jane, could hardly stay even to be grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing. here ceased the concert part of the evening, for miss woodhouse and miss fairfax were the only young lady performers; but soon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancingâ€”originating no

emma had no longer an alarm for henry; his interest was yet safe; and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. not more than five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful, and she found herself well matched in a partner. they were a couple worth looking at.
two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. it was growing late, and miss bates became anxious to get home, on her motherâ€™s account. after some attempts, therefore, to be permitted to begin again, they were obliged to thank mrs. weston, look sorrowful, and have done.
â€œperhaps it is as well,â€ said frank churchill, as he attended emma to her carriage. â€œi must have asked miss fairfax, and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me, after yours.â€

ling children round the bakerâ€™s little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread, she knew she had no reason to complain, and was amused enough; quite enough still to stand at the door. a mind lively and at ease, can do with seeing nothing, and can see nothing that does not answer.
she looked down the randalls road. the scene enlarged; two persons appeared; mrs. weston and her son-in-law; they were walking into highbury;â€”to hartfield of course. they were stopping, however, in the first place at mrs. batesâ€™s; whose house was a little nearer randalls than fordâ€™s; and had all but knocked, when emma caught their eye.â€”immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; and the agreeableness of yesterdayâ€™s engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting. mrs. weston informed her that she was going to call on the bateses, in order to hear the new instrument.
â€œfor my companion tells me,â€ said she, â€œthat i absolutely promised miss bates last night, that i would come t

â€œdo come with me,â€ said mrs. weston, â€œif it be not very disagreeable to you. it need not detain us long. we will go to hartfield afterwards. we will follow them to hartfield. i really wish you to call with me. it will be felt so great an attention! and i always thought you meant it.â€
he could say no more; and with the hope of hartfield to reward him, returned with mrs. weston to mrs. batesâ€™s door. emma watched them in, and then joined harriet at the interesting counter,â€”trying, with all the force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be it ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern. at last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.
â€œshould i send it to mrs. goddardâ€™s, maâ€™am?â€ asked mrs. ford.â€”â€œyesâ€”noâ€”yes, to mrs. goddardâ€™s. only my patt

â€œthat you do not give another half-second to the subject. to hartfield, if you please, mrs. ford.â€
â€œaye, that will be much best,â€ said harriet, quite satisfied, â€œi should not at all like to have it sent to mrs. goddardâ€™s.â€
voices approached the shopâ€”or rather one voice and two ladies: mrs. weston and miss bates met them at the door.
â€œmy dear miss woodhouse,â€ said the latter, â€œi am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while, and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and miss smith. how do you do, miss smith?â€”very well i thank you.â€”and i begged mrs. weston to come with me, that i might be sure of succeeding.â€
â€œi hope mrs. bates and miss fairfax areâ€”â€

emma would be â€œvery happy to wait on mrs. bates, &c.,â€ and they did at last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from miss bates than,
â€œhow do you do, mrs. ford? i beg your pardon. i did not see you before. i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. jane came back delighted yesterday. thank ye, the gloves do very wellâ€”only a little too large about the wrist; but jane is taking them in.â€

miss bates had just done as patty opened the door; and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to, pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.
â€œpray take care, mrs. weston, there is a step at the turning. pray take care, miss woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircaseâ€”rather darker and narrower than one could wish. miss smith, pray take care. miss woodhouse, i am quite concerned, i am sure you hit your foot. miss smith, the step at the turning.â€

the appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was tranquillity itself; mrs. bates, deprived of her usual employment, slumbering on one side of the fire, frank churchill, at a table near her, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and jane fairfax, standing with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.
busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing emma again.
â€œthis is a pleasure,â€ said he, in rather a low voice, â€œcoming at least ten minutes earlier than i had calculated. you find me trying to be useful; tell me if

â€œconjectureâ€”aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes one conjectures wrong. i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall make this rivet quite firm. what nonsense one talks, miss woodhouse, when hard at work, if one talks at all;â€”your real workmen, i suppose, hold their tongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a wordâ€”miss fairfax said something about conjecturing. there, it is done. i have the pleasure, madam, (to mrs. bates,) of restoring your spectacles, healed for the present.â€
he was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape a little from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged miss fairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.
â€œif you are very kind,â€ said he, â€œit will be one of the waltzes we danced last night;â€”let me live them over again. you did not enjoy them as i did; you appeared tired the whole time. i believe you were glad we danced no longer; but i w

â€œi do not see much sign of it. she is playing robin adair at this momentâ€”his favourite.â€
shortly afterwards miss bates, passing near the window, descried mr. knightley on horse-back not far off.
â€œmr. knightley i declare!â€”i must speak to him if possible, just to thank him. i will not open the window here; it would give you all cold; but i can go into my motherâ€™s room you know. i dare say he will come in when he knows who is here. quite delightful to have you all meet so!â€”our little room so honoured!â€

â€œhow dâ€™ ye do?â€”how dâ€™ye do?â€”very well, i thank you. so obliged to you for the carriage last night. we were just in time; my mother just ready for us. pray come in; do come in. you will find some friends here.â€
so began miss bates; and mr. knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,
â€œhow is your niece, miss bates?â€”i want to inquire after you all, but particularly your niece. how is miss fairfax?â€”i hope she caught no cold last night. how is she to-day? tell me how miss fairfax is.â€
and miss bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else. the listeners were amused; and mrs. weston gave emma a look of particular meaning.

but emma still shook her head in steady scepticism.
â€œso obliged to you!â€”so very much obliged to you for the carriage,â€ resumed miss bates.
he cut her short with,

â€œoh! dear, kingstonâ€”are you?â€”mrs. cole was saying the other day she wanted something from kingston.â€
â€œmrs. cole has servants to send. can i do any thing for you?â€
â€œno, i thank you. but do come in. who do you think is here?â€”miss woodhouse and miss smith; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte. do put up your horse at the crown, and come in.â€

â€œyes, very true,â€ cried frank, â€œvery true. you want your neighboursâ€™ opinions. i do not wonder at you. if one could ascertain what the chief of themâ€”the coles, for instance. they are not far off. shall i call upon them? or miss bates? she is still nearer.â€”and i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body. i think we do want a larger council. suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us?â€
â€œwellâ€”if you please,â€ said mrs. weston rather hesitating, â€œif you think she will be of any use.â€

â€œaye, do, frank.â€”go and fetch miss bates, and let us end the matter at once. she will enjoy the scheme, i am sure; and i do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties. fetch miss bates. we are growing a little too nice. she is a standing lesson of how to be happy. but fetch them both. invite them both.â€

s of decision. all the rest, in speculation at least, was perfectly smooth. all the minor arrangements of table and chair, lights and music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between mrs. weston and mrs. stokes.â€”every body invited, was certainly to come; frank had already written to enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight, which could not possibly be refused. and a delightful dance it was to be.
most cordially, when miss bates arrived, did she agree that it must. as a counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much safer character,) she was truly welcome. her approbation, at once general and minute, warm and incessant, could not but please; and for another half-hour they were all walking to and fro, between the different rooms, some suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment of the future. the party did not break up without emmaâ€™s being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero

â€œyes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and i must be off immediately. i am almost afraid that every moment will bring him.â€

â€œyesâ€”i have called there; passing the door, i thought it better. it was a right thing to do. i went in for three minutes, and was detained by miss batesâ€™s being absent. she was out; and i felt it impossible not to wait till she came in. she is a woman that one may, that one must laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. it was better to pay my visit, thenâ€â€”

there was no reason to suppose mr. elton thought at all differently from his wife. he seemed not merely happy with her, but proud. he had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to highbury, as not even miss woodhouse could equal; and the greater part of her new acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of judging, following the lead of miss batesâ€™s good-will, or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself, were very well satisfied; so that mrs. eltonâ€™s praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded by miss woodhouse, who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being â€œvery pleasant and very elegantly dressed.â€
in one respect mrs. elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first. her feelings altered towards emma.â€”

she looked on with some amusement.â€”miss batesâ€™s gratitude for mrs. eltonâ€™s attentions to jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth. she was quite one of her worthiesâ€”the most amiable, affable, delightful womanâ€”just as accomplished and condescending as mrs. elton meant to be considered. emmaâ€™s only surprize was that jane fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate mrs. elton as she seemed to do. she heard of her walking with the eltons, sitting with the eltons, spending a day with the eltons! this was

jane had come to highbury professedly for three months; the campbells were gone to ireland for three months; but now the campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till midsummer, and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there. according to miss batesâ€”it all came from herâ€”mrs. dixon had written most pressingly. would jane but go, means were to be found, servants sent, friends contrivedâ€”no travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still she had declined it!
â€œshe must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing this invitation,â€ was emmaâ€™s conclusion. â€œshe must be under some sort of penance, inflicted either by the campbells or herself. there is great fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.â€”she is not

â€œsuch attentions as mrs. eltonâ€™s, i should have imagined, would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax. mrs. eltonâ€™s invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting.â€
â€œi should not wonder,â€ said mrs. weston, â€œif miss fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her auntâ€™s eagerness in accepting mrs. eltonâ€™s civilities for her. poor miss bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated, in spite of the very natural wish of a little change.â€
both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few minutes silence, he said,

no invitation came amiss to her. her bath habits made evening-parties perfectly natural to her, and maple grove had given her a taste for dinners. she was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms, at the poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being no ice in the highbury card-parties. mrs. bates, mrs. perry, mrs. goddard and others, were a good deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged. in the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior partyâ€”in which her card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true styleâ€”and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper

mr. westonâ€™s ball was to be a real thing. a very few to-morrows stood between the young people of highbury and happiness.
mr. woodhouse was resigned. the time of year lightened the evil to him. may was better for every thing than february. mrs. bates was engaged to spend the evening at hartfield, james had due notice, and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little henry nor dear little john would have any thing the matter with them, while dear emma were gone.

emma found that it was not mr. westonâ€™s fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger. they had stopped at mrs. batesâ€™s door to offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the eltons.
frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness, which shewed a mind not at ease. he was looking about, he was going to the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,â€”impatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her.

mr. and mrs. elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed.
â€œbut miss bates and miss fairfax!â€ said mr. weston, looking about. â€œwe thought you were to bring them.â€
the mistake had been slight. the carriage was sent for them now. emma longed to know what frankâ€™s first opinion of mrs. elton might be; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and her smiles of graciousness. he was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion, by giving her very proper attention, after the introduction had passed.
in a few minutes the carriage returned.â€”someb

â€œa very fine young man indeed, mr. weston. you know i candidly told you i should form my own opinion; and i am happy to say that i am extremely pleased with him.â€”you may believe me. i never compliment. i think him a very handsome

while she talked of his son, mr. westonâ€™s attention was chained; but when she got to maple grove, he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.
mrs. elton turned to mrs. weston. â€œi have no doubt of its being our carriage with miss bates and jane. our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious!â€”i believe we drive faster than any body.â€”what a pleasure it is to send oneâ€™s carriage for a friend!â€”i understand you were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite unnecessary. you may be very sure i shall always take care of them.â€

â€œso very obliging of you!â€”no rain at all. nothing to signify. i do not care for myself. quite thick shoes. and jane declaresâ€”well!â€”(as soon as she was within the door) well! this is brilliant indeed!â€”this is admirable!â€”excellently contrived, upon my word. nothing wanting. could not have imagined it.â€”so well lighted up!â€”j

frank churchill returned to his station by emma; and as soon as miss bates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of mrs. elton and miss fairfax, who were standing a little way behind her.â€”he was thoughtful. whether he were overhearing too, she could not determine. after a good many compliments to jane on her dress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, mrs. elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herselfâ€”and it was, â€œhow do you like my gown?â€”how do you like my trimming?â€”how has wright done my hair?â€â€”wit

 not thrown away on her, she bounded higher than ever, flew farther down the middle, and was in a continual course of smiles.
mr. elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (emma trusted) very foolish. she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife, though growing very like her;â€”she spoke some of her feelings, by observing audibly to her partner,
â€œknightley has taken pity on poor little miss smith!â€”very good-natured, i declare.â€
supper was announced. the move began; and miss bates might be heard from that moment, without interruption, till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon.

in this state frank churchill had found her, she trembling and conditioning, they loud and insolent. by a most fortunate chance his leaving highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment. the pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward, and leave his horses to meet him by another road, a mile or two beyond highburyâ€”and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of miss bates, and to have forgotten to restore them, he had been obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a few minutes: he was therefore later than he had intended; and being on foot, was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them. the terror which the woman and boy had been creating in harriet was then their own portion. he had left them completely frightened; and harriet eagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak, had just strength enough to reach hartfield, before her spirits were quit

brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking, of private understanding even, between frank churchill and jane.
he had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to spend his evening at hartfield. emma and harriet were going to walk; he joined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who, like themselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as the weather threatened rain; mr. and mrs. weston and their son, miss bates and her niece, who had accidentally met. they all united; and, on reaching hartfield gates, emma, who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father, pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him. the randalls party agreed to it immediately; and after a pretty long speech from miss bates, which few persons listened to, she also found it possible to accept dear miss woodhouseâ€™s most obliging invitation.

emma was out of hearing. she had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of mr. westonâ€™s hint.
â€œwhy, to own the truth,â€ cried miss bates, who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes, â€œif i must speak on this subject, there is no denying that mr. frank churchill might haveâ€”i do not mean to say that he did not dream itâ€”i am sure i have sometimes the oddest dreams in the worldâ€”but if i am questioned about it, i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring; for mrs. perry herself mentioned it to my mother, and the coles knew of it as well as ourselvesâ€”but it was quite a secret, known to nobody

they had a very fine day for box hill; and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in favour of a pleasant party. mr. weston directed the whole, officiating safely between hartfield and the vicarage, and every body was in good time. emma and harriet went together; miss bates and her niece, with the eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. mrs. weston remained with mr. woodhouse. nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there. seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency. there was a languor, a want of spirits, a want of union, which could not be got over. they separated too much into parties. the eltons walked together; mr. knightley

some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. miss bates said a great deal; mrs. elton swelled at the idea of miss woodhouseâ€™s presiding; mr. knightleyâ€™s answer was the most distinct.
â€œis miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of?â€

f this day of pleasure. such another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people, she hoped never to be betrayed into again.
while waiting for the carriage, she found mr. knightley by her side. he looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,
â€œemma, i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do: a privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but i must still use it. i cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates? how could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?â€”emma, i had not thought it possible.â€
emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.
â€œnay, how could i help saying what i did?â€”nobody could have helped it. it was not so very bad. i dare say she did not understand me.â€

 motion. she continued to look back, but in vain; and soon, with what appeared unusual speed, they were half way down the hill, and every thing left far behind. she was vexed beyond what could have been expressedâ€”almost beyond what she could conceal. never had she felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance in her life. she was most forcibly struck. the truth of this representation there was no denying. she felt it at her heart. how could she have been so brutal, so cruel to miss bates! how could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued! and how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude, of concurrence, of common kindness!
time did not compose her. as she reflected more, she seemed but to feel it more. she never had been so depressed. happily it was not necessary to speak. there was only harriet, who seemed not in spirits herself, fagged, and very willing to be silent; and emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the

â€œthe ladies were all at home.â€ she had never rejoiced at the sound before, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs, with any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation, or of deriving it, except in subsequent ridicule.
there was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking. she heard miss batesâ€™s voice, something was to be done in a hurry; the maid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment, and then ushered her in too soon. the aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room. jane she had a distinct glimpse of, looking extremely ill; and, before the door had shut them out, she heard miss bates saying, â€œwell, my dear, i shall say you are laid down upon the bed, and i am sure you are ill enough.â€

â€œi am afraid jane is not very well,â€ said she, â€œbut i do not know; they tell me she is well. i dare say my daughter will be here presently, miss woodhouse. i hope you find a chair. i wish hetty had not gone. i am very little ableâ€”have you a chair, maâ€™am? do you sit where you like? i am sure she will be here presently.â€
emma seriously hoped she would. she had a momentâ€™s fear of miss bates keeping away from her. but miss bates soon cameâ€”â€œvery happy and obligedâ€â€”but emmaâ€™s conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as beforeâ€”less ease of look and manner. a very friendly inquiry after miss fairfax, she hoped, might lead the way to a return of old feelings. the touch seemed immediate.

er towards jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing but pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past, obliged her to admit that jane might very naturally resolve on seeing mrs. cole or any other steady friend, when she might not bear to see herself. she spoke as she felt, with earnest regret and solicitudeâ€”sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from miss bates to be now actually determined on, might be as much for miss fairfaxâ€™s advantage and comfort as possible. â€œit must be a severe trial to them all. she had understood it was to be delayed till colonel campbellâ€™s return.â€
â€œso very kind!â€ replied miss bates. â€œbut you are always kind.â€
there was no bearing such an â€œalways;â€ and to break through her dreadful gratitude, emma made the direct inquiry ofâ€”
â€œwhereâ€”may i ask?â€”is miss fairfax going?â€

ame to talk to mr. elton about relief from the parish; he is very well to do himself, you know, being head man at the crown, ostler, and every thing of that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some help; and so, when mr. elton came back, he told us what john ostler had been telling him, and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to randalls to take mr. frank churchill to richmond. that was what happened before tea. it was after tea that jane spoke to mrs. elton.â€
miss bates would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her; but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of mr. frank churchillâ€™s going, she proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence.
what mr. elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the accumulation of the ostlerâ€™s own knowledge, and the knowledge of the servants at randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from richmond soon after the return

there was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and it caught emmaâ€™s attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind. the contrast between mrs. churchillâ€™s importance in the world, and jane fairfaxâ€™s, struck her; one was every thing, the other nothingâ€”and she sat musing on the difference of womanâ€™s destiny, and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed, till roused by miss batesâ€™s saying,
â€œaye, i see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. what is to become of that?â€”very true. poor dear jane was talking of it just now.â€”â€˜you must go,â€™ said she. â€˜you and i must part. you will have no business here.â€”let it stay, however,â€™ said she; â€˜give it houseroom till colonel campbell comes back. i shall talk about it to him; he will settle for me; he will help me out of all my difficulties.â€™â€”and to this day, i do believe, she knows not whether it was his pre

emma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself. time, however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be friends again. while he stood, as if meaning to go, but not goingâ€”her father began his inquiries.
â€œwell, my dear, and did you get there safely?â€”and how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter?â€”i dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming. dear emma has been to call on mrs. and miss bates, mr. knightley, as i told you before. she is always so attentive to them!â€
emmaâ€™s colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a smile, and shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at mr. knightley.â€”it seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour, as if his eyes received the truth from hers, and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.â€” he looked at her with a glow of regard. she was warmly gratifiedâ€”and in anot

 little gallantry, or however else it happened, but she thought nothing became him more.â€”it was with him, of so simple, yet so dignified a nature.â€”she could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction. it spoke such perfect amity.â€”he left them immediately afterwardsâ€”gone in a moment. he always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory, but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance.
emma could not regret her having gone to miss bates, but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier;â€”it would have been a great pleasure to talk over jane fairfaxâ€™s situation with mr. knightley.â€”neither would she regret that he should be going to brunswick square, for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyedâ€”but it might have happened at a better timeâ€”and to have had longer notice of it, would have been pleasanter.â€”they parted thorough friends, however; she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance, and his

r of such exercise for his patient. the answer was only in this short note:
â€œmiss fairfaxâ€™s compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to any exercise.â€
emma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it was impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. in spite of the answer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove to mrs. batesâ€™s, in the hope that jane would be induced to join herâ€”but it would not do;â€”miss bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest serviceâ€”and every thing that message could do was triedâ€”but all in vain. miss bates was obliged to return without success; jane was quite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse.â€”emma wished she could have seen her, and tried her own powers; bu

emma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an examination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to miss bates with a most friendly note. in half an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks from miss bates, bu

â€œah!â€ thought emma, â€œhe would have done as much for harriet.â€
â€œthis was settled last night, and frank was off with the light this morning. he stopped at highbury, at the batesâ€™s, i fancy, some timeâ€”and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as i tell you, he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.â€”he was very much agitatedâ€”very much, indeedâ€”to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing i had ever seen him before.â€”in addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion o

this point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear emmaâ€™s thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them, sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hoursâ€”mrs. weston, who had been calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took hartfield in her way home, almost as much in duty to emma as in pleasure to herself, to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.
mr. weston had accompanied her to mrs. batesâ€™s, and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having then induced miss fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned with much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a quarter of an hour spent in mrs. batesâ€™s parlour, with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded.

 said, in a low, but very feeling tone,
â€œthis is most kind, indeed!â€”miss woodhouse, it is impossible for me to expressâ€”i hope you will believeâ€”excuse me for being so entirely without words.â€
emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, if the sound of mrs. eltonâ€™s voice from the sitting-room had not checked her, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand.
mrs. bates and mrs. elton were together. miss bates was out, which accounted for the previous tranquillity. emma could have wished mrs. elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience with every body; and as mrs. elton met her with unusual graciousness, she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm.
she soon believed herself to penetrate mrs. eltonâ€™s thoughts, and understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being in miss fairfaxâ€™s confidence, and fancying herself acquainte

d with what was still a secret to other people. emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face; and while paying her own compliments to mrs. bates, and appearing to attend to the good old ladyâ€™s replies, she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to miss fairfax, and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,
â€œwe can finish this some other time, you know. you and i shall not want opportunities. and, in fact, you have heard all the essential already. i only wanted to prove to you that mrs. s. admits our apology, and is no

        â€œfor when a ladyâ€™s in the case,
        â€œyou know all other things give place.â€
 
now i say, my dear, in our case, for lady, readâ€”â€”mum! a word to the wise.â€”i am in a fine flow of spirits, anâ€™t i? but i want to set your heart at ease as to mrs. s.â€”my representation, you see, has quite appeased her.â€
and again, on emmaâ€™s merely turning her head to look at mrs. batesâ€™s knitting, she added, in a half whisper,
â€œi mentioned no names, you will observe.â€”oh! no; cautious as a minister of state. i managed it extremely well.â€
emma could not doubt. it was a palpable display, repeated on every possible occasion. when they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and mrs. weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with,
â€œdo not you think, miss woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered?â€”do not you think her cure does p

erry the highest credit?â€”(here was a side-glance of great meaning at jane.) upon my word, perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!â€”oh! if you had seen her, as i did, when she was at the worst!â€â€”and when mrs. bates was saying something to emma, whispered farther, â€œwe do not say a word of any assistance that perry might have; not a word of a certain young physician from windsor.â€”oh! no; perry shall have all the credit.â€
â€œi have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, miss woodhouse,â€ she shortly afterwards began, â€œsince the party to box hill. very pleasant party. but yet i think there was something wanting. things did not seemâ€”that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.â€”so

 it appeared to me at least, but i might be mistaken. however, i think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again. what say you both to our collecting the same party, and exploring to box hill again, while the fine weather lasts?â€”it must be the same party, you know, quite the same party, not one exception.â€
soon after this miss bates came in, and emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting, she supposed, from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say every thing.
â€œthank you, dear miss woodhouse, you are all kindness.â€”it is impossible to sayâ€”yes, indeed, i quite understandâ€”dearest janeâ€™s prospectsâ€”that is, i do not mean.â€”but she is charmingly recovered.â€”how is mr. woodhouse?â€”i am so glad.â€”quite out of my power.â€”such a happy little circle as you

ess, mrs. elton, speaking louder, said,
â€œyes, here i am, my good friend; and here i have been so long, that anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologise; but, the truth is, that i am waiting for my lord and master. he promised to join me here, and pay his respects to you.â€
â€œwhat! are we to have the pleasure of a call from mr. elton?â€”that will be a favour indeed! for i know gentlemen do not like morning visits, and mr. eltonâ€™s time is so engaged.â€
â€œupon my word it is, miss bates.â€”he really is engaged from morning to night.â€”there is no end of peopleâ€™s coming to him, on some pretence or other.â€”the magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens, are always wanting his opinion. they seem not able to do any thing without him.â€”â€˜upon my word, mr. e.,â€™ i often say, â€˜rather you than i.â€”i do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument, if i had half so many applicants.â€™â€”bad enough as it is, for i absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable

 degree.â€”i believe i have not played a bar this fortnight.â€”however, he is coming, i assure you: yes, indeed, on purpose to wait on you all.â€ and putting up her hand to screen her words from emmaâ€”â€œa congratulatory visit, you know.â€”oh! yes, quite indispensable.â€
miss bates looked about her, so happilyâ€”!
â€œhe promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from knightley; but he and knightley are shut up together in deep consultation.â€”mr. e. is knightleyâ€™s right hand.â€
emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, â€œis mr. elton gone on foot to donwell?â€”he will have a hot walk.â€
â€œoh! no, it is a meeting at the crown, a regular meeting. weston and cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead.â€”i fan

oon nothing; and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it.
â€œit is to be a secret, i conclude,â€ said he. â€œthese matters are always a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them. only let me be told when i may speak out.â€”i wonder whether jane has any suspicion.â€
he went to highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on that point. he told her the news. was not she like a daughter, his eldest daughter?â€”he must tell her; and miss bates being present, it passed, of course, to mrs. cole, mrs. perry, and mrs. elton, immediately afterwards. it was no more than the principals were prepared for; they had calculated from the time of its being known at randalls, how soon it would be over highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as the evening wonder in many a family circle, with great sagacity.
in general, it was a very well approved match. some might think him, and others might think her, the most in luck. one set might recommend
