Eowyn - 
                    	The
Lady of Rohan and future wife of Faramir. Eowyn, driven by a desire
for combat and for Aragorn's affection, disguises herself in men's
clothing and endangers herself to challenge the Lord of the Nazgul. With
the passing of the Shadow of Mordor, Eowyn is freed from her desire
for war, and she turns her affections to Faramir.
