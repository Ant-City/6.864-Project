Bernhard V. O'Hare - 
 A wartime pal of Vonnegut. O'Hare appears when Vonnegut
visits him and his wife in Pennsylvania while trying to do research
and collect remembrances for his Dresden book. Like his wife, Mary,
and Vonnegut himself, O'Hare, a nonfictional character, helps ground Slaughterhouse-Five in
reality. Vonnegut actually has this other survivor of the firebombing
contribute to the research and recollection process involved in
creating the book, which allows us to take the novelistic details
as fact and appreciate the thoughtful manner in which they are presented.
