sonnet

 in slashing, hewing, cleaving, word and deed,
   i was the foremost knight of chivalry,
   stout, bold, expert, as e'er the world did see;
 thousands from the oppressor's wrong i freed;
 great were my feats, eternal fame their meed;
   in love i proved my truth and loyalty;
   the hugest giant was a dwarf for me;
 ever to knighthood's laws gave i good heed.
 my mastery the fickle goddess owned,
   and even chance, submitting to control,
     grasped by the f

loutish son, the love he bears him so blindfolds his eyes that he does
not see his defects, or, rather, takes them for gifts and charms of mind

it down again, not knowing what to write. one of these times, as i was
pondering with the paper before me, a pen in my ear, my elbow on the
desk, and my cheek in my hand, thinking of what i should say, there came
in unexpectedly a certain lively, clever friend of mine, who, seeing me
so deep in thought, asked the reason; to which i, making no mystery of
it, answered that i was thinking of the preface i had to make for the
story of "don quixote," which so troubled me that i had a mind not to
make any at all, nor even publish the achievements of so noble a knight.

"for, how could you expect me not to feel uneasy about what that ancient
lawgiver they call the public will say when it sees me, after slumbering
so many years in the silence of oblivion, coming out now with all my
years upon my back, and with a book as dry as a rush, devoid of
invention, meagre in style, poor in thoughts, wholly wanting in learning

well, then, attend to me, and you will see how, in the opening and
shutting of an eye, i sweep away all your difficulties, and supply all
those deficiencies which you say check and discourage you from bringing
before the world the story of your famous don quixote, the light and

"say on," said i, listening to his talk; "how do you propose to make up
for my diffidence, and reduce to order this chaos of perplexity i am in?"

to which he made answer, "your first difficulty about the sonnets,
epigrams, or complimentary verses which you want for the beginning, and
which ought to be by persons of importance and rank, can be removed if

observations made such an impression on me that, without attempting to
question them, i admitted their soundness, and out of them i determined

been seen in that neighbourhood. i have no desire to magnify the service

d, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names out of his
memory and fancy, he decided upon calling him rocinante, a name, to his
thinking, lofty, sonorous, and significant of his condition as a hack
before he became what he now was, the first and foremost of all the hacks
in the world.

having got a name for his horse so much to his taste, he was anxious to
get one for himself, and he was eight days more pondering over this
point, till at last he made up his mind to call himself "don quixote,"
whence, as has been already said, the authors of this veracious history
have inferred that his name must have been beyond a doubt quixada, and
not quesada as others would have it. recollecting, however, that the
valiant amadis was not content to call himself curtly amadis and nothing
more, but added the name of his kingdom and country to make it famous,
and called himself amadis of gaul, he, like a good knight, resolved to
add on the name of his, and to style himself don quixote of la

this speech, especially when he had thought of some one to call his lady!
there was, so the story goes, in a village near his own a very
good-looking farm-girl with whom he had been at one time in love, though,
so far as is known, she never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter.

execution of his design, urged on to it by the thought of all the world
was losing by his delay, seeing what wrongs he intended to right,
grievances to redress, injustices to repair, abuses to remove, and duties
to discharge. so, without giving notice of his intention to anyone, and
without anybody seeing him, one morning before the dawning of the day

t forth my first sally in the early morning, will do
it after this fashion? 'scarce had the rubicund apollo spread o'er the
face of the broad spacious earth the golden threads of his bright hair,
scarce had the little birds of painted plumage attuned their notes to
hail with dulcet and mellifluous harmony the coming of the rosy dawn,
that, deserting the soft couch of her jealous spouse, was appearing to
mortals at the gates and balconies of the manchegan horizon, when the
renowned knight don quixote of la mancha, quitting the lazy down, mounted
his celebrated steed rocinante and began to traverse the ancient and
famous campo de montiel;'" which in fact he was actually traversing.
"happy the age, happy the time," he continued, "in which shall be made
known my deeds of fame, worthy to be moulded in brass, carved in marble,
limned in pictures, for a memorial for ever. and thou, o sage magician,
whoever thou art, to whom it shall fall to be the chronicler of this
wondrous history, forge

bout it, and that rocinante was in a hurry to reach the
stable, he made for the inn door, and perceived the two gay damsels who
were standing there, and who seemed to him to be two fair maidens or
lovely ladies taking their ease at the castle gate.

at this moment it so happened that a swineherd who was going through the
stubbles collecting a drove of pigs (for, without any apology, that is
what they are called) gave a blast of his horn to bring them together,
and forthwith it seemed to don quixote to be what he was expecting, the
signal of some dwarf announcing his arrival; and so with prodigious
satisfaction he rode up to the inn and to the ladies, who, seeing a man
of this sort approaching in full armour and with lance and buckler, were
turning in dismay into the inn, when don quixote, guessing their fear by
their flight, raising his pasteboard visor, disclosed his dry dusty
visage, and with courteous bearing and gentle voice addressed them, "your
ladyships need not fly or fear

any rudeness, for that it belongs not to
the order of knighthood which i profess to offer to anyone, much less to
highborn maidens as your appearance proclaims you to be." the girls were
looking at him and straining their eyes to make out the features which
the clumsy visor obscured, but when they heard themselves called maidens,
a thing so much out of their line, they could not restrain their
laughter, which made don quixote wax indignant, and say, "modesty becomes
the fair, and moreover laughter that has little cause is great silliness;
this, however, i say not to pain or anger you, for my desire is none
other than to serve you."

the incomprehensible language and the unpromising looks of our cavalier
only increased the ladies' laughter, and that increased his irritation,
and matters might have gone farther if at that moment the landlord had
not come out, who, being a very fat man, was a very peaceful one.

 he,
seeing this grotesque figure clad in armour that did not match any more
than his saddle, bridle, lance, buckler, or corselet, was not at all
indisposed to join the damsels in their manifestations of amusement; but,
in truth, standing in awe of such a complicated armament, he thought it
best to speak him fairly, so he said, "senor caballero, if your worship
wants lodging, bating the bed (for there is not one in the inn) there is
plenty of everything else here." don quixote, observing the respectful
bearing of the alcaide of the fortress (for so innkeeper and inn seemed
in his eyes), made answer, "sir castellan, for me anything will suffice,
for

'my armour is my only wear,
my only rest the fray.'"

the host fancied he called him castellan because he took him for a
"worthy of castile," though he was in fact an andalusian, and one from
the strand of san lucar, as crafty a thief as cacus and as full of tricks
as a student or a page. "in that case," said h

"'your bed is on the flinty rock,

and if so, you may dismount and safely reckon upon any quantity of
sleeplessness under this roof for a twelvemonth, not to say for a single
night." so saying, he advanced to hold the stirrup for don quixote, who
got down with great difficulty and exertion (for he had not broken his
fast all day), and then charged the host to take great care of his horse,
as he was the best bit of flesh that ever ate bread in this world. the
landlord eyed him over but did not find him as good as don quixote said,
nor even half as good; and putting him up in the stable, he returned to
see what might be wanted by his guest, whom the damsels, who had by this
time made their peace with him, were now relieving of

green ribbons, which, as there was no untying the knots,
required to be cut. this, however, he would not by any means consent to,
so he remained all the evening with his helmet on, the drollest and
oddest figure that can be imagined; and while they were removing his
armour, taking the baggages who were about it for ladies of high degree
belonging to the castle, he said to them with great sprightliness:

"oh, never, surely, was there knight

has given you the knowledge of my name altogether prematurely. a time,

 ladyships to command and me to obey, and then

the girls, who were not used to hearing rhetoric of this sort, had
nothing to say in reply; they only asked him if he wanted anything to
eat. "i would gladly eat a bit of something," said don quixote, "for i
feel it would come very seasonably." the day happened to be a friday, and
in the whole inn there was nothing but some pieces of the fish they call
in castile "abadejo," in andalusia "bacallao," and in some places
"curadillo," and in others "troutlet;" so they asked him if he thought he
could eat troutlet, for there was no other fish to give him. "if there be
troutlets enough," said don quixote, "they will be the same thing as a
trout; for it is all one to me whether i am given ei

lse placed it there, and this service one of the ladies
rendered him. but to give him anything to drink was impossible, or would
have been so had not the landlord bored a reed, and putting one end in
his mouth poured the wine into him through the other; all which he bore
with patience rather than sever the ribbons of his helmet.

while this was going on there came up to the inn a sowgelder, who, as he
approached, sounded his reed pipe four or five times, and thereby
completely convinced don quixote that he was in some famous castle, and
that they were regaling him with music, and that the stockfish was trout,
the bread the whitest, the wenches ladies, and the landlord the castellan
of the castle; and consequently he held that his enterprise and sally had
been to some purpose. but still it distressed him to think he had not
been dubbed a knight, for it was plain to him he could not lawfully
engage in any adventure without receiving the order of knighthood.

harassed by this reflection, he made haste with his scanty pothouse
supper, and having finished it called the landlord, and shutting himself
into the stable with him, fell on his knees before him, saying, "from
this spot i rise not, valiant knight, until your courtesy grants me the
boon i seek, one that will redound to your praise and the benefit of the
human race." the landlord, seeing his guest at his feet and hearing a
speech of this kind, stood starin

g at him in bewilderment, not knowing
what to do or say, and entreating him to rise, but all to no purpose
until he had agreed to grant the boon demanded of him. "i looked for no

have to tell you that the boon i have asked and your liberality has
granted is that you shall dub me knight to-morrow morning, and that
to-night i shall watch my arms in the chapel of this your castle; thus
tomorrow, as i have said, will be accomplished what i so much desire,
enabling me lawfully to roam through all the four quarters of the world
seeking adventures on behalf of those in distress, as is the duty of
chivalry and of knights-errant like myself, whose ambition is dire

oreover, that in this
castle of his there was no chapel in which he could watch his armour, as
it had been pulled down in order to be rebuilt, but that in a case of
necessity it might, he knew, be watched anywhere, and he might watch it
that night in a courtyard of the castle, and in the morning, god willing,
the requisite ceremonies might be performed so as to have him dubbed a
knight, and so thoroughly dubbed that nobody could be more so. he asked
if he had any money with him, to which don quixote replied that he had
not a farthing, as in the histories of knights-errant he had never read
of any of them carrying any. on this point the landlord told him he was
mistaken; for, though not recorded in the histories, because in the
author's opinion there was no need to mention anything so obvious and
necessary as money and clean shirts, it was not to be supposed therefore
that they did not carry them, and he might regard it as certain and
established that all knights-errant (about whom t

everything in cunning saddle-bags that were hardly seen on the horse's
croup, as if it were something else of more importance, because, unless
for some such reason, carrying saddle-bags was not very favourably
regarded among knights-errant. he therefore advised him (and, as his
godson so soon to be, he might even command him) never from that time
forth to travel without money and the usual requirements, and he would
find the advantage of them when he least expected it.

don quixote promised to follow his advice scrupulously, and it was
arranged forthwith that he should watch his armour in a large yard at one
side of the inn; so, collecting it all together, don quixote placed it on
a trough that stood by the side of a well, and bracing his buckler on his
arm he grasped his lance and began with a stately air to march up and
down in front of the trough, and as he began his march night began to
fall.

the landlord told all the people who were in the inn about the craz

, they
flocked to see it from a distance, and observed with what composure he
sometimes paced up and down, or sometimes, leaning on his lance, gazed on
his armour without taking his eyes off it for ever so long; and as the
night closed in with a light from the moon so brilliant that it might vie
with his that lent it, everything the novice knight did was plainly seen
by all.

meanwhile one of the carriers who were in the inn thought fit to water
his team, and it was necessary to remove don quixote's armour as it lay
on the trough; but he seeing the other approach hailed him in a loud
voice, "o thou, whoever thou art, rash knight that comest to lay hands on
the armour of the most valorous errant that ever girt on sword, have a
care what thou dost; touch it not unless thou wouldst lay down thy life
as the penalty of thy rashness." the carrier gave no heed to these words
(and he would have done better to heed them if he had been heedful of his
health), but seizing it by the straps fl

ung the armour some distance from
him. seeing this, don quixote raised his eyes to heaven, and fixing his
thoughts, apparently, upon his lady dulcinea, exclaimed, "aid me, lady
mine, in this the first encounter that presents itself to this breast
which thou holdest in subjection; let not thy favour and protection fail
me in this first jeopardy;" and, with these words and others to the same
purpose, dropping his buckler he lifted his lance with both hands and
with it smote such a blow on the carrier's head that he stretched him on
the ground, so stunn

ed that had he followed it up with a second there
would have been no need of a surgeon to cure him. this done, he picked up
his armour and returned to his beat with the same serenity as before.




shortly after this, another, not knowing what had happened (for the
carrier still lay senseless), came with the same object of giving water
to his mules, and was proceeding to remove the armour in order to clear
the trough, when don quixote, without uttering a word or imploring aid
from anyone, once more dropped his buckler and once more lifted his
lance, and without actually breaking the second carrier's head into
pieces, made more than three of it, for he laid it open in four. at the
noise all the people of the inn ran to the spot, and among them the
landlord. seeing this, don quixote braced his buckler on his arm, and
with his hand on his sword exclaimed, "o lady of beauty, strength and
support of my faint heart, it is t
 
 ___________________________
 
ime for thee to turn the eyes of thy
greatness on this thy captive knight on the brink of so mighty an
adventure." by this he felt himself so inspired that he would not have
flinched if all the carriers in the world had assailed him. the comrades
of the wounded perceiving the plight they were in began from a distance
to shower stones on don quixote, who screened himself as best he could
with his buckler, not daring to quit the trough and leave his armour
unprotected. the landlord shouted to them to leave him alone, for he had
already told them that he was mad, and as a madman he would not be
accountable even if he killed them all. still louder shouted don quixote,
calling them knaves and traitors, and the lord of the castle, who allowed
knights-errant to be treated in this fashion, a villain and a low-born
knight whom, had he recei

lready
told him, he said, there was no chapel in the castle, nor was it needed
for what remained to be done, for, as he understood the ceremonial of the
order, the whole point of being dubbed a knight lay in the accolade and
in the slap on the shoulder, and that could be administered in the middle
of a field; and that he had now done all that was needful as to watching
the armour, for all requirements were satisfied by a watch of two hours
only, while he had been more than four about it. don quixote believed it
all, and told him he stood there ready to obey him, and to make an end of
it with as much despatch as possible; for, if he were again attacked, and
felt himself to be dubbed knight, he would not, he thought, leave a soul
alive in the castle, except such as out of respect he might spare at his
bidding.

thus warned and menaced, the castellan forthwith brought out a book in
which he used to enter the straw and barley he served out to the
carriers, and, with a lad carrying a c

andle-end, and the two damsels
already mentioned, he returned to where don quixote stood, and bade him
kneel down. then, reading from his account-book as if he were repeating
some devout prayer, in the middle of his delivery he raised his hand and
gave him a sturdy blow on the neck, and then, with his own sword, a smart
slap on the shoulder, all the while muttering between his teeth as if he
was saying his prayers. having done this, he directed one of the ladies
to gird on his sword, which she did with great self-possession and
gravity, and not a little was required to

 prevent a burst of laughter at
each stage of the ceremony; but what they had already seen of the novice
knight's prowess kept their laughter within bounds. on girding him with
the sword the worthy lady said to him, "may god make your worship a very
fortunate knight, and grant you success in battle." don quixote asked her
name in order that he might from that time forward know to whom he was
beholden for the favour he had received, as he meant to confer upon her
some portion of the honour he acquired by the might of his arm. she
answered with great humility that she was called la tolosa, and that she
was the daughter of a cobbler of toledo who lived in the stalls of
sanchobienaya, and that wherever she might be she would serve and esteem
him as her lord. don quixote said in reply that she would

he asked her name, and she said it was la molinera, and that she was the
daughter of a respectable miller of antequera; and of her likewise don
quixote requested that she would adopt the "don" and call herself dona
molinera, making offers to her further services and favours.

having thus, with hot haste and speed, brought to a conclusion these
never-till-now-seen ceremonies, don quixote was on thorns until he saw
himself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures; and saddling
rocinante at once he mounted, and embracing his host, as he returned
thanks for his kindness in knighting him, he addressed him in language so
extraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of it or report it.
the landlord, to get him out of the inn, replied with no less rhetoric
though with shorter words, and without calling upon him to pay the
reckoning let him go with a godspeed.

of what happened to our knight when he left the inn


day was dawning when don quixote quitted the inn, so happy, so gay, so
exhilarated at finding himself now dubbed a knight, that his joy was like
to burst his horse-girths. however, recalling the advice of his host as
to the requisites he ought to carry with him, especially that referring
to money and shirts, he determined to go home and provide himself with
all, and also with a squire, for he reckoned upon securing a
farm-labourer, a neighbour of his, a poor man with a family, but very
well qualified for the office of s

oak, and tied to another, and
stripped from the waist upwards, a youth of about fifteen years of age,
from whom the cries came. nor were they without cause, for a lusty farmer
was flogging him with a belt and following up every blow with scoldings
and commands, repeating, "your mouth shut and your eyes open!" while the
youth made answer, "i won't do it again, master mine; by god's passion i
won't do it again, and i'll take more care of the flock another time."

seeing what was going on, don quixote said in an angry voice,
"discourteous knight, it ill becomes you to assail one who cannot defend
himself; mount your steed and take your lance" (for there was a lance
leaning against the oak to which the mare was tied), "and i will make you
know that you are behaving as a coward." the farmer, seeing before him
this figure in full armour brandishing a lance over his head, gave
himself up for dead, and made answer meekly, "sir knight, this youth that
i am chastising is my servant, employed

 by me to watch a flock of sheep
that i have hard by, and he is so careless that i lose one every day, and
when i punish him for his carelessness and knavery he says i do it out of
niggardliness, to escape paying him the wages i owe him, and before god,
and on my soul, he lies."

"lies before me, base clown!" said don quixote. "by the sun that shines
on us i have a mind to run you through with this lance. pay him at once
without another word; if not, by the god that rules us i will make an end
of you, and annihilate you on the spot; release him instantly."




the farmer hung his head, and without a word untied his servant, of whom
don quixote asked how much his master owed him.

he replied, nine months at seven reals a month. don quixote added it up,
found that it came to sixty-three reals, and told the

 farmer to pay it
down immediately, if he did not want to die for it.

the trembling clown replied that as he lived and by the oath he had sworn
(though he had not sworn any) it was not so much; for there were to be
taken into account and deducted three pairs of shoes he had given him,
and a real for two blood-lettings when he was sick.

"all that is very well," said don quixote; "but let the shoes and the
blood-lettings stand as a setoff against the blows you have given him
without any cause; for if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you paid
for, you have damaged that of his body, and if the barber took blood from
him when he was sick, you have drawn it when he was sound; so on that
score he owes you nothing."

"the difficulty is, sir knight, that i have no money here; let andres
come home with me, and i will pay him all, real by real."

"i go with him!" s

aid the youth. "nay, god forbid! no, senor, not for the
world; for once alone with me, he would ray me like a saint bartholomew."

"he will do nothing of the kind," said don quixote; "i have only to
command, and he will obey me; and as he has sworn to me by the order of
knighthood which he has received, i leave him free, and i guarantee the
payment."

"consider what you are saying, senor," said the youth; "this master of
mine is not a knight, nor has he received any order of knighthood; for he
is juan haldudo the rich, of quintanar."

"that matters little," replied don quixote; "there may be haldudos
knights; moreover, everyone is the son of his works."

"that

is true," said andres; "but this master of mine--of what works is
he the son, when he refuses me the wages of my sweat and labour?"

"i do not refuse, brother andres," said the farmer, "be good enough to
come along with me, and i swear by all the orders of knighthood there are
in the world to pay you as i have agreed, real by real, and perfumed."

"for the perfumery i excuse you," said don quixote; "give it to him in
reals, and i shall be satisfied; and see that you do as you have sworn;
if not, by the same oath i swear to come back and hunt you out and punish
you; and i shall find you though you should lie closer than a lizard. and
if you desire to know who it is lays this command upon you, that you be
more firmly bound to obey it, know that i am the valorous don quixote of
la mancha, the undoer of wrongs and injustices; and so, god be with you,
and keep in mind what you have pro

ed him up again, and gave him such a
flogging that he left him for dead.

"now, master andres," said the farmer, "call on the undoer of wrongs; you
will find he won't undo that, though i am not sure that i have quite done
with you, for i have a good mind to flay you alive." but at last he
untied him, and gave him leave to go look for his judge in order to put
the sentence pronounced into execution.

andres went off rather down in the mouth, swearing he would go to look
for the valiant don quixote of la mancha and tell him exactly what had
happened, and that all would have to be repaid him sevenfold; but for all
that, he went off weeping, while his master stood laughing.

thus did the valiant don quixote right that wrong, and, thoroughly
satisfied with what had taken place, as he considered he had made a very
happy and noble beginning with his knighthood, he took the road towards
his village in perfect self-content, saying in a low voice, "well mayest
thou this day call thyself f

greatest wrong and grievance that ever injustice conceived and cruelty
perpetrated: who hath to-day plucked the rod from the hand of yonder
ruthless oppressor so wantonly lashing that tender child."

he now came to a road branching in four directions, and immediately he
was reminded of those cross-roads where knights-errant used to stop to

ke. in imitation of them he halted for
a while, and after having deeply considered it, he gave rocinante his
head, submitting his own will to that of his hack, who followed out his
first intention, which was to make straight for his own stable. after he
had gone about two miles don quixote perceived a large party of people,
who, as afterwards appeared, were some toledo traders, on their way to
buy silk at murcia. there were six of them coming along under their
sunshades, with four servants mounted, and three muleteers on foot.
scarcely had don quixote descried them when the fancy possessed him that
this must be some new adventure; and to help him to imitate as far as he
could those passages he had read of in his books, here seemed to come one
made on purpose, which he reso

ze of their owner; they wished, however, to learn quietly
what was the object of this confession that was demanded of them, and one
of them, who was rather fond of a joke and was very sharp-witted, said to
him, "sir knight, we do not know who this good lady is that you speak of;
show her to us, for, if she be of such beauty as you suggest, with all
our hearts and without any pressure we will confess the truth that is on
your part required of us."

"if i were to show her to you," replied don quixote, "what merit would
you have in confessing a truth so manifest? the essential point is that
without seeing her you must believe, confess, affirm, swear, and defend
it; else ye have to do with me in battle, ill-conditioned, arrogant
rabble that ye are; and come ye on, one by one as the order of knighthood
requires, or all together as is the custom and vile usage of your breed,
here do i bide and await you relying on the justice of the cause i
maintain."

"sir knight," replied the trader,

is lady, though it be no bigger than a grain of wheat;
for by the thread one gets at the ball, and in this way we shall be
satisfied and easy, and you will be content and pleased; nay, i believe
we are already so far agreed with you that even though her portrait
should show her blind of one eye, and distilling vermilion and sulphur
from the other, we would nevertheless, to gratify your worship, say all
in her favour that you desire."

"she distils nothing of the kind, vile rabble," said don quixote, burning
with rage, "nothing of the kind, i say, only ambergris and civet in
cotton; nor is she one-eyed or humpbacked, but straighter than a
guadarrama spindle: but ye must pay for the blasphemy ye have uttered
against beauty like that of my lady."

and so saying, he charged with levelled lance against the one who had
spoken, with such fury and fierceness that, if luck had not contrived
that rocinante should stumble midway and come down, it would have gone
hard with the rash trader. d

our; and all the while he was struggling to get
up he kept saying, "fly not, cowards and caitiffs! stay, for not by my
fault, but my horse's, am i stretched here."




one of the muleteers in attendance, who could not have had much good
nature in him, hearing the poor prostrate man blustering in this style,
was unable to refrain from giving him an answer on his ribs; and coming
up to him he seized his lance, and having broken it in pieces, with one
of them he began so to belabour our don quixote that, notwithstanding and
in spite of his armour, he milled him like a measure of wheat. his
masters called out not to lay on so hard and to leave him alone, but the
muleteers blood was up, and he did not care to drop the game until he had
vented the rest of his wrath, and gathering up the remaining fragments of
the lance he finished with a discharge upon the unhappy victim, who all
through the storm of sticks that rained on him never ceased threatening
heaven, and earth, and the brigand

and so he went on with the ballad as far as the lines:

o noble marquis of mantua,
  my uncle and liege lord!

as chance would have it, when he had got to this line there happened to
come by a peasant from his own village, a neighbour of his, who had been
with a load of wheat to the mill, and he, seeing the man stretched there,
came up to him and asked him who he was and what was the matter with him
that he complained so dolefully.

don quixote was firmly persuaded that this was the marquis of mantua, his
uncle, so the only answer he made was to go on with his ballad, in which
he told the tale of his misfortune, and of the loves of the emperor's son
and his wife all exactly as the ballad sings it.

the peasant stood amazed at hearing such nonsense, and relieving him of
the visor, already battered to pieces by blows, he wiped his face, which
was covered with dust, and as soon as he had done so he recognised him
and said, "senor

s he could his breastplate and
backpiece to see if he had any wound, but he could perceive no blood nor
any mark whatever. he then contrived to raise him from the ground, and
with no little difficulty hoisted him upon his ass, which seemed to him
to be the easiest mount for him; and collecting the arms, even to the
splinters of the lance, he tied them on rocinante, and leading him by the
bridle and the ass by the halter he took the road for the village, very
sad to hear what absurd stuff don quixote was talking.

nor was don quixote less so, for what with blows and bruises he could not
sit upright on the ass, and from time to time he sent up sighs to heaven,
so that once more he drove the peasant to ask what ailed him. and it
could have been only the devil himself that put into his head tales to
match his own adventures, for now, forgetting baldwin, he bethought
himself of the moor abindarraez, when the alcaide of antequera, rodrigo
de narvaez, took him prisoner and carried him awa

 he gave
him for reply the same words and phrases that the captive abindarraez
gave to rodrigo de narvaez, just as he had read the story in the "diana"
of jorge de montemayor where it is written, applying it to his own case
so aptly that the peasant went along cursing his fate that he had to
listen to such a lot of nonsense; from which, however, he came to the
conclusion that his neighbour was mad, and so made all haste to reach the
village to escape the wearisomeness of this harangue of don quixote's;
who, at the end of it, said, "senor don rodrigo de narvaez, your worship
must know that this fair xarifa i have mentioned is now the lovely
dulcinea del toboso, for whom i have done, am doing, and will do the most
famous deeds of chivalry that in this world have been seen, are to be
seen, or ever shall be seen."

to this the peasant answered, "senor--sinner that i am!--cannot your
worship see that i am not don rodrigo de narvaez nor the marquis of
mantua, but pedro alonso your neigh

bour, and that your worship is neither
baldwin nor abindarraez, but the worthy gentleman senor quixada?"

"i know who i am," replied don quixote, "and i know that i may be not
only those i have named, but all the twelve peers of france and even all
the nine worthies, since my achievements surpass all that they have done
all together and each of them on his own account."

with this talk and more of the same kind they reached the village just as
night was beginning to fall, but the peasant waited until it was a little
later that the belaboured gentleman might not be seen riding in such a
miserable trim. when it was what seemed to

him the proper time he entered
the village and went to don quixote's house, which he found all in
confusion, and there were the curate and the village barber, who were
great friends of don quixote, and his housekeeper was saying to them in a
loud voice, "what does your worship think can have befallen my master,
senor licentiate pero perez?" for so the curate was called; "it is three
days now since anything has been seen of him, or the hack, or the
buckler, lance, or armour. miserable me! i am certain of it, and it is as
true as that i was born to die, that these accursed books of chivalry he
has, and has got into the way of reading so constantly, have upset his
reason; for now i r

they carried him to bed at once, and after searching for his wounds could
find none, but he said they were all bruises from having had a severe
fall with his horse rocinante when in combat with ten giants, the biggest
and the boldest to be found on earth.

"so, so!" said the curate, "are there giants in the dance? by the sign of
the cross i will burn them to-morrow before the day over."

they put a host of questions to don quixote, but his only answer to all
was--give him something to eat, and leave him to sleep, for that was what
he needed most. they did so, and the curate questioned the peasant at
great length as to how he had found don quixote. he told him, and the
nonsense he had talked when found and on the way home, all which made the
licentiate the more eager to do what he did the next day, which was to
summon his friend the barber, master nicholas, and go with him to don
quixote's house.

 any more books, and so he
decided that, "contents uncertified," all the rest should be burned; but
just then the barber held open one, called "the tears of angelica."

"i should have shed tears myself," said the curate when he heard the
title, "had i ordered that book to be burned, for its author was one of
the famous poets of the world, not to say of spain, and was very happy in
the translation of some of ovid's fables."

away by this noise and outcry, they proceeded no farther with the
scrutiny of the remaining books, and so it is thought that "the carolea,"
"the lion of spain," and "the deeds of the emperor," written by don luis
de avila, went to the fire unseen and unheard; fo

among those that remained, and perhaps if the curate had seen them they
would not have undergone so severe a sentence.

when they reached don quixote he was already out of bed, and was still
shouting and raving, and slashing and cutting all round, as wide awake as
if he had never slept.

they closed with him and by force got him back to bed, and when he had
become a little calm, addressing the curate, he said to him, "of a truth,
senor archbishop turpin, it is a great disgrace for us who call ourselves
the twelve peers, so carelessly to allow the knights of the court to gain
the victory in this tourney, we the adventurers having carr

honour on the three former days."

"hush, gossip," said the curate; "please god, the luck may turn, and what
is lost to-day may be won to-morrow; for the present let your worship
have a care of your health, for it seems to me that you are
over-fatigued, if not badly wounded."

"wounded no," said don quixote, "but bruised and battered no doubt, for
that bastard don roland has cudgelled me with the trunk of an oak tree,
and all for envy, because he sees that i alone rival him in his
achievements. but i should not call myself reinaldos of montalvan did he
not pay me for it in spite of all his enchantments as soon as i rise from
this bed. for the present let them bring me something to eat, for that, i
feel, is what will be more to my purpose, and leave it to me to avenge
myself."

iner did not permit it, and so in them was verified
the proverb that the innocent suffer for the guilty.

one of the remedies which the curate and the barber immediately applied
to their friend's disorder was to wall up and plaster the room where the
books were, so that when he got up he should not find them (possibly the
cause being removed the effect might cease), and they might say that a
magician had carried them off, room and all; and this was done with all
despatch. two days later don quixote got up, and the first thing he did
was to go and look at his books, and not finding the room where he had
left it, he wandered from side to side looking for it. he came to the
place where the door used to be, and tried it with his hands, and turned
and twisted his eyes in every direction without saying a word; but after
a good while he asked his housekeeper whereabouts was the room that held
his books.

the housekeeper, who had been already well instructed in what she was to
answer, sa

er a little while he made off, flying through the roof,
and left the house full of smoke; and when we went to see what he had
done we saw neither book nor room: but we remember very well, the
housekeeper and i, that on leaving, the old villain said in a loud voice
that, for a private grudge he owed the owner of the books and the room,
he had done mischief in that house that would be discovered by-and-by: he
said too that his name was the sage munaton."

"he must have said friston," said don quixote.

"i don't know whether he called himself friston or friton," said the
housekeeper, "i only know that his name ended with 'ton.'"

"so it does," said don quixote, "and he is a sage magician, a great enemy
of mine, who has a spite against me because he knows by his arts and lore
that in process of time i am to engage in single combat with a knight
whom he befriends and that i am to conquer, and he will be unable to
prevent it; and for this reason he endeavours to do me all the ill turns

that he can; but i promise him it will be hard for him to oppose or avoid
what is decreed by heaven."

"who doubts that?" said the niece; "but, uncle, who mixes you up in these
quarrels? would it not be better to remain at peace in your own house
instead of roaming the world looking for better bread than ever came of
wheat, never reflecting that many go for wool and come back shorn?"

"oh, niece of mine," replied don quixote, "how much astray art thou in
thy reckoning: ere they shear me i shall have plucked away and stripped
off the beards of all who dare to touch only the tip of a hair of mine."

the two were unwilling to make any further answer, as they saw that his
anger was kindling.

in short, then, he remained at home fifteen days very quietly without
showing any signs of a desire to take up with his former delusions, and
during this time he held lively discussions with his two gossips, the
curate a

nd the barber, on the point he maintained, that knights-errant
were what the world stood most in need of, and that in him was to be
accomplished the revival of knight-errantry. the curate sometimes
contradicted him, sometimes agreed with him, for if he had not observed
this precaution he would have been unable to bring him to reason.

meanwhile don quixote worked upon a farm labourer, a neighbour of his, an
honest man (if indeed that title can be given to him who is poor), but
with very little wit in his pate. in a word, he so talked him over, and
with such persuasions and promises, that the poor clown made up his mind
to sally forth with him and serve him as esquire. don quixote, among
other things, told him he ought to be ready to go with him gladly,
because any moment an adventure might occur that might win an island in
the twinkling of

 an eye and leave him governor of it. on these and the
like promises sancho panza (for so the labourer was called) left wife and
children, and engaged himself as esquire to his neighbour.

don quixote next set about getting some money; and selling one thing and
pawning another, and making a bad bargain in every case, he got together
a fair sum. he provided himself with a buckler, which he begged as a loan
from a friend, and, restoring his battered helmet as best he could, he
warned his squire sancho of the day and hour he meant to set out, that he
might provide himself with what he thought most needful. above all, he
charged him to take alforjas with him. the other said he would, and t

he meant to take also a very good ass he had, as he was not much given to
going on foot. about the ass, don quixote hesitated a little, trying
whether he could call to mind any knight-errant taking with him an
esquire mounted on ass-back, but no instance occurred to his memory. for
all that, however, he determined to take him, intending to furnish him
with a more honourable mount when a chance of it presented itself, by
appropriating the horse of the first discourteous knight he encountered.
himself he provided with shirts and such other things as he could,

im; all which being done,
without taking leave, sancho panza of his wife and children, or don
quixote of his housekeeper and niece, they sallied forth unseen by
anybody from the village one night, and made such good way in the course
of it that by daylight they held themselves safe from discovery, even
should search be made for them.

sancho rode on his ass like a patriarch, with his alforjas and bota, and
longing to see himself soon governor of the island his master had
promised him. don quixote decided upon taking the same route and road he
had taken on his first journey, that over the campo de montiel, which he
travelled with less discomfort than on the last occasion, for, as it was
early morning and the rays of the sun fell on them obliquely, the heat
did not distress them.

and now said sancho panza to his master, "your worship will take care,
senor knight-errant, not to forget about the island you have promised me,
for be it ever so big i'll be equal to governing it."

o which don quixote replied, "thou must know, friend sancho panza, that
it was a practice very much in vogue with the knights-errant of old to
make their squires governors of the islands or kingdoms they won, and i
am determined that there shall be no failure on my part in so liberal a
custom; on the contrary, i mean to improve upon it, for they sometimes,
and perhaps most frequently, waited until their squires were old, and
then when they had had enough of service and hard days and worse nights,

thee to be crowned king of one of them. nor needst thou count this
wonderful, for things and chances fall to the lot of such knights in ways

i promise thee."

"in that case," said sancho panza, "if i should become a king by one of
those miracles your worship speaks of, even juana gutierrez, my old
woman, would come to be queen and my children infantes."

"well, who doubts it?" said don quixote.

"i doubt it," replied sancho panza, "because for my part i am persuaded
that though god should shower down kingdoms upon earth, not one of them
would fit the head of mari gutierrez. let me tell you, senor, she is not
worth two maravedis for a queen; countess will fit her better, and that
only with god's help."

"leave it to god, sancho," returned don quixote, "for he will give her
what suits her best; but do not undervalue thyself so much as to come to
be content with anything less

"i will not, senor," answered sancho, "specially as i have a man of such
quality for a master in your worship, who will know how to give me all
that will be suitable for me and that i can bear."

sweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth."

"what giants?" said sancho panza.

"those thou seest there," answered his master, "with the long arms, and
some have them nearly two leagues long."

"look, your worship," said sancho; "what we see there are not giants but
windmills, and what seem to be their arms are the sails that turned by
the wind make the millstone go."

"it is easy to see," replied don quixote, "that thou art not used to this
business of adventures; those are giants; and if thou art afraid, away
with thee out of this and betake thyself to prayer while i engage them in
fierce and unequal combat."

so saying, he gave the spur to his steed rocinante, heedless of the cries
his squire sancho sent after him, warning him that most certainly they
were windmills and not giants he was going to attack. he, however, was so
positive they were giants that he neither heard the cries of sanc

a slight breeze at this moment sprang up, and the great sails began to
move, seeing which don quixote exclaimed, "though ye flourish more arms
than the giant briareus, ye have to reckon with me."

so saying, and commending himself with all his heart to his lady
dulcinea, imploring her to support him in such a peril, with lance in
rest and covered by his buckler, he charged at rocinante's fullest gallop
and fell upon the first mill that stood in front of him; but as he drove
his lance-point into the sail the wind whirled it round with such force
that it shivered the lance to pieces, swee

who went rolling over on the plain, in a sorry condition. sancho hastened
to his assistance as fast as his ass could go, and when he came up found
him unable to move, with such a shock had rocinante fallen with him.

"god bless me!" said sancho, "did i not tell your worship to mind what
you were about, for they were only windmills? and no one could have made
any mistake about it but one who had something of the same kind in his
head."

"hush, friend sancho," replied don quixote, "the fortunes of war more
than any other are liable to frequent fluctuations; and moreover i think,
and it is the truth, that that same sage friston who carried off my study
and books, has turned these giants into mills in order to rob me of the
glory of vanquishing them, such is the enmity he bears me; but in the end
his wicked arts will avail but little against my good sword."

"god order it as he may," said sancho panza, and helping him to rise got
him up again on rocinante, whose s

houlder was half out; and then,
discussing the late adventure, they followed the road to puerto lapice,
for there, said don quixote, they could not fail to find adventures in
abundance and variety, as it was a great thoroughfare. for all that, he
was much grieved at the loss of his lance, and saying so to his squire,
he added, "i remember having read how a spanish knight, diego perez de
vargas by name, having broken his sword in battle, tore from an oak a
ponderous bough or branch, and with it did such things that day, and
pounded so many moors, that he got the surname of machuca, and he and his
descendants from that

such deeds that thou mayest deem thyself very fortunate in being found
worthy to come and see them, and be an eyewitness of things that will

"be that as god will," said sancho, "i believe it all as your worship
says it; but straighten yourself a little, for you seem all on one side,
may be from the shaking of the fall."

"that is the truth," said don quixote, "and if i make no complaint of the
pain it is because knights-errant are not permitted to complain of any
wound, even though their bowels be coming out through it."

"if so," said sancho, "i have nothing to say; but god knows i would
rather your worship complained when anything ailed you. for my part, i
confess i must complain however small the ache may be; unless this rule
about not complaining extends to the squires of knights-errant also."

along behind his master munching deliberately,
and from time to time taking a pull at the bota with a relish that the
thirstiest tapster in malaga might have envied; and while he went on in
this way, gulping down draught after draught, he never gave a thought to
any of the promises his master had made him, nor did he rate it as
hardship but rather as recreation going in quest of adventures, however
dangerous they might be. finally they passed the night among some trees,
from one of which don quixote plucked a dry branch to serve him after a
fashion as a lance, and fixed on it the head he had removed from the
broken one. all that night don quixote lay awake thinking of his lady
dulcinea, in order to conform to what he had read in his books, how many
a night in the forests and deserts knights used to lie sleepless
supported by the memory of their mistresses. not so did sancho panza
spend it, for having his stomach full of something stronger than chicory
water he made but one sleep of

it, and, if his master had not called him,
neither the rays of the sun beating on his face nor all the cheery notes
of the birds welcoming the approach of day would have had power to waken
him. on getting up he tried the bota and found it somewhat less full than
the night before, which grieved his heart because they did not seem to be
on the way to remedy the deficiency readily. don quixote did not care to
break his fast, for, as has been already said, he confined himself to
savoury recollections for nourishment.

they returned to the road they had set out with, leading to puerto
lapice, and at three in the afternoon they came in sight of it. "here,
brother sancho panza," said don quixote when he saw it, "we may plunge
our hands up to the elbows in what they call adventures; but observe,
even shouldst thou see me in the greatest danger in the world, thou must
not put a ha

ted or allowed thee by the laws of knighthood to help me until thou
hast been dubbed a knight."

"most certainly, senor," replied sancho, "your worship shall be fully
obeyed in this matter; all the more as of myself i am peaceful and no
friend to mixing in strife and quarrels: it is true that as regards the
defence of my own person i shall not give much heed to those laws, for
laws human and divine allow each one to defend himself against any
assailant whatever."

"that i grant," said don quixote, "but in this matter of aiding me
against knights thou must put a restraint upon thy natural impetuosity."

"i will do so, i promise you," answered sancho, "and will keep this
precept as carefully as sunday."

while they were thus talking there appeared on the road two friars of the
order of st. benedict, mounted on two dromedaries, for not less tall were
the two mules they rode on. they wore travelling spectacles and carried
sunshades; and behind them came a coach attended by four or

five persons
on horseback and two muleteers on foot. in the coach there was, as
afterwards appeared, a biscay lady on her way to seville, where her
husband was about to take passage for the indies with an appointment of
high honour. the friars, though going the same road, were not in her
company; but the moment don quixote perceived them he said to his squire,
"either i am mistaken, or this is going to be the most famous adventure
that has ever been seen, for those black bodies we see there must be, and
doubtless are, magicians who are carrying off some stolen princess in
that coach, and with all my might i must undo this wrong."

"this will be worse than the windmills," said sancho. "look, senor; those
are friars of st. benedict, and the coach plainly belongs to some
travellers: i tell you to mind well w

hat you are about and don't let the
devil mislead you."

"i have told thee already, sancho," replied don quixote, "that on the
subject of adventures thou knowest little. what i say is the truth, as
thou shalt see presently."

so saying, he advanced and posted himself in the middle of the road along
which the friars were coming, and as soon as he thought they had come
near enough to hear what he said, he cried aloud, "devilish and unnatural
beings, release instantly the highborn princesses whom you are carrying
off by force in this coach, else prepare to meet a speedy death as the
just punishment 
 
 ___________________________
 
of your evil deeds."

the friars drew rein and stood wondering at the appearance of don quixote
as well as at his words, to which they replied, "senor caballero, we are
not devilish or unnatural, but two brothers of st. benedict following our
road, nor do we know whether or not there are any captive princesses
coming in this coach."

"no soft words with me, for i know you, lying rabble," said don quixote,
and without waiting for a reply he spurred rocinante and with levelled
lance charged the first friar with such fury and determination, that, if
the friar had not flung himself off the mule, he would have brought him
to the ground against his will, and sore wounded, if not killed outright.
the second brother, seeing how his comrade was treated, drove his heels
into his castle of a mule and made off across the country faster than the
wind.

und, dismounting briskly
from his ass, rushed towards him and began to strip off his gown. at that
instant the friars muleteers came up and asked what he was stripping him
for. sancho answered them that this fell to him lawfully as spoil of the
battle which his lord don quixote had won. the muleteers, who had no idea
of a joke and did not understand all this about battles and spoils,
seeing that don quixote was some distance off talking to the travellers
in the coach, fell upon sancho, knocked him down, and leaving hardly a
hair in his beard, belaboured him with kicks and left him stretched
breathless and senseless on the ground; and without any more delay helped
the friar to mount, who, trembling, terrified, and pale, as soon as he
found himself in the saddle, spurred after his companion, who was
standing at a distance looking on, watching the result of the onslaught;
then, not caring to w

don quixote was, as has been said, speaking to the lady in the coach:
"your beauty, lady mine," said he, "may now dispose of your person as may
be most in accordance with your pleasure, for the pride of your ravishers
lies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine; and lest
you should be pining to know the name of your deliverer, know that i am
called don quixote of la mancha, knight-errant and adventurer, and
captive to the peerless and beautiful lady dulcinea del toboso: and in
retur

n for the service you have received of me i ask no more than that
you should return to el toboso, and on my behalf present yourself before
that lady and tell her what i have done to set you free."

one of the squires in attendance upon the coach, a biscayan, was
listening to all don quixote was saying, and, perceiving that he would
not allow the coach to go on, but was saying it must return at once to el
toboso, he made at him, and seizing his lance addressed him in bad
castilian and worse biscayan after his fashion, "begone, caballero, and
ill go with thee; by the god that made me, unless thou quittest coach,
slayest thee as art here a biscayan."

don quixote understood him quite well, and answered him very quietly, "if
thou wert a knight, as thou art none, i should have

already chastised thy
folly and rashness, miserable creature." to which the biscayan returned,
"i no gentleman!--i swear to god thou liest as i am christian: if thou
droppest lance and drawest sword, soon shalt thou see thou art carrying
water to the cat: biscayan on land, hidalgo at sea, hidalgo at the devil,
and look, if thou sayest otherwise thou liest."

"'"you will see presently," said agrajes,'" replied don quixote; and
throwing his lance on the ground he drew his sword, braced his buckler on
his arm, and attacked the biscayan, bent upon taking his life.

the biscayan, when he saw him coming on, though he wished to dismount
from his mule, in which, being one of those sorry ones let out for hire,
he had no confidence, had no choice but to draw his sword; it was lucky
for him, however, that he was near the coach, from which he was able to
snatch a cushion that served him for a shield; and they went

at one
another as if they had been two mortal enemies. the others strove to make
peace between them, but could not, for the biscayan declared in his
disjointed phrase that if they did not let him finish his battle he would
kill his mistress and everyone that strove to prevent him. the lady in
the coach, amazed and terrified at what she saw, ordered the coachman to
draw aside a little, and set herself to watch this severe struggle, in
the course of which the biscayan smote don quixote a mighty stroke on the
shoulder over the top of his buckler, which, given to one without armour,
would have cleft him to the waist. don quixote, feeling the weight of
this prodigious blow, cried aloud, saying, "o lady of my soul, dulcinea,
flower of beauty, come to the aid of this your knight, who, in fulfilling
his obligations to your beauty, finds himself in this extreme peril." to
say this, to lift his sword, to shelter himself well behind his buckler,
and to assail the biscayan was t

he work of an instant, determined as he
was to venture all upon a single blow. the biscayan, seeing him come on
in this way, was convinced of his courage by his spirited bearing, and
resolved to follow his example, so he waited for him keeping well under
cover of his cushion, being unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with
his mule, which, dead tired and never meant for this kind of game, could
not stir a step.

on, then, as aforesaid, came don quixote against the wary biscayan, with
uplifted sword and a firm intention of splitting him in half, while on
his side the biscayan waited for him sword in hand, and under the
protection of his cushion; and all present stood trembling, waiting in
suspense the result of blows such as threatened to fall, and the lady in
the coach and the rest of her following were making a thousand vows and
offerings to all the images and shrines of spain, that god might deliver
her squire and all of them from th

themselves. but it spoils all, that at this point and crisis the author
of the history leaves this battle impending, giving as excuse that he
could find nothing more written about these achievements of don quixote
than what has been already set forth. it is true the second author of
this work was unwilling to believe that a history so curious could have
been allowed to fall under the sentence of oblivion, or that the wits of
la mancha could have been so undiscerning as not to preserve in their
archives or registries some documents referring to this famous knight;
and this being his persuasion, he did not despair of finding the
conclusion of this pleasant history, which, heaven favouring him, he di

in the first part of this history we left the valiant biscayan and the
renowned don quixote with drawn swords uplifted, ready to deliver two
such furious slashing blows that if they had fallen full and fair they
would at least have split and cleft them asunder from top to toe and laid
them open like a pomegranate; and at this so critical point the
delightful history came to a stop and stood cut short without any
intimation from the author where what was missing was to be found.

on the other hand, it struck me that, inasmuch as among his books there
had been found such modern ones as "the enlightenment of jealousy" and
the "nymphs and shepherds of henares," his story must likewise be modern,
and that though it might not be written, it might exist in the memory of
the people of his village and of those in the neighbourhood. this
reflection kept me perplexed and longing to know really and truly the
whole life and wondrous deeds of our famous spaniard, don quixote of la
mancha, light and mirror of manchegan chivalry, and the first that in our
age and in these so evil days devoted himself to the labour and exercise
of the arms of knight-errantry, righting wrongs, succouring widows, and
protecting damsels of that sort that used to ride about, whip in hand, on
their palfreys, with all their virginity about them, from mountain to
mountain and valley to valley--for, if it were not for some ruffian, or

which time they had never slept a day under a roof, went to their graves

and other respects our gallant don quixote is worthy of everlasting and
notable praise, nor should it be withheld even from me for the labour and
pains spent in searching for the conclusion of this delightful history;
though i know well that if heaven, chance and good fortune had not helped
me, the world would have remained deprived of an entertainment and
pleasure that for a couple of hours or so may well occupy him who shall
read it attentively. the discovery of it occurred in this way.

the margin, as i told you, this is written: 'this dulcinea del toboso so
often mentioned in this history, had, they say, the best hand of any
woman in all la mancha for salting pigs.'"

when i heard dulcinea del toboso named, i was struck with surprise and
amazement, for it occurred to me at once that these pamphlets contained
the history of don quixote. with this idea i pressed him to read the
beginning, and doing so, turning the arabic offhand into castilian, he
told me it meant, "history of don quixote of la mancha, written by cide
hamete benengeli, an arab historian." it required great caution to hide
the joy i felt when the title of the book reached my ears, and snatching
it from the silk mercer, i bought all the papers and pamphlets from the
boy for half a real; and if he had had his wits about him and had known

the cloister of the cathedral, and begged him to turn all these pamphlets
that related to don quixote into the castilian tongue, without omitting
or adding anything to them, offering him whatever payment he pleased. he
was satisfied with two arrobas of raisins and two bushels of wheat, and
promised to translate them faithfully and with all despatch; but to make
the matter easier, and not to let such a precious find out of my hands, i

etween don quixote and the biscayan was
drawn to the very life, they planted in the same attitude as the history
describes, their swords raised, and the one protected by his buckler, the
other by his cushion, and the biscayan's mule so true to nature that it
could be seen to be a hired one a bowshot off. the biscayan had an
inscription under his feet which said, "don sancho de azpeitia," which no
doubt must have been his name; and at the feet of rocinante was another
that said, "don quixote." rocinante was marvellously portrayed, so long
and thin, so lank and lean, with so much backbone and so far gone in
consumption, that he showed plainly with what judgment and propriety the
name of rocinante had been bestowed upon him. near him was sancho panza
holding the halter of his ass, at whose feet was another label that said,
"sancho zancas," and according to the picture, he must have had a big
belly, a short body, and long shanks, for which reason, no doubt, the

useless--as if a mountain had fallen on him, he began to bleed from nose,
mouth, and ears, reeling as if about to fall backwards from his mule, as
no doubt he would have done had he not flung his arms about its neck; at
the same time, however, he slipped his feet out of the stirrups and then
unclasped his arms, and the mule, taking fright at the terrible blow,
made off across the plain, and with a few plunges flung its master to the
ground. don quixote stood looking on very calmly, and, when he saw him
fall, leaped from his horse and with great briskness ran to him, and,
presenting the point of his sword to his eyes, bade him surrender, or he
would cut his head off. the biscayan was so bewildered that he was unable
to answer a word, and it would have gone hard with him, so blind was don

the combat in great terror, hastened to where he stood and implored him

gravity and dignity, "in truth, fair ladies, i am well content to do what
ye ask of me; but it must be on one condition and understanding, which is
that this knight promise me to go to the village of el toboso, and on my
behalf present himself before the peerless lady dulcinea, that she deal

grant him the victory, and that he might thereby win some island to make
him governor of, as he had promised. seeing, therefore, that the struggle
was now over, and that his master was returning to mount rocinante, he

rup for him, and, before he could mount, he
went on his knees before him, and taking his hand, kissed it saying, "may
it please your worship, senor don quixote, to give me the government of
that island which has been won in this hard fight, for be it ever so big
i feel myself in sufficient force to be able to govern it as much and as
well as anyone in the world who has ever governed islands."

to which don quixote replied, "thou must take notice, brother sancho,
that this adventure and those like it are not adventures of islands, but
of cross-roads, in which nothing is got except a broken head or an ear
the less: have patience, for adventures will present themselves from
which i may make you, not only a governor, but something more."

sancho gave him many thanks, and again kissing his hand and the skirt of
his hauberk, helped him to mount rocinante, and mounting his ass himself,

ow his master, who at a brisk pace, without taking
leave, or saying anything further to the ladies belonging to the coach,
turned into a wood that was hard by. sancho followed him at his ass's
best trot, but rocinante stepped out so that, seeing himself left behind,
he was forced to call to his master to wait for him. don quixote did so,
reining in rocinante until his weary squire came up, who on reaching him
said, "it seems to me, senor, it would be prudent in us to go and take
refuge in some church, for, seeing how mauled he with whom you fought has
been left, it will be no wonder if they give information of the affair to
the holy brotherhood and arrest us, and, faith, if they do, before we
come out of gaol we shall have to sweat for it."

"peace," said don quixote; "where hast thou ever seen or heard that a

knight-errant has been arraigned before a court of justice, however many
homicides he may have committed?"

"i know nothing about omecils," answered sancho, "nor in my life have had
anything to do with one; i only know that the holy brotherhood looks
after those who fight in the fields, and in that other matter i do not
meddle."

"then thou needst have no uneasiness, my friend," said don quixote, "for
i will deliver thee out of the hands of the chaldeans, much more out of
those of the brotherhood. but tell me, as thou livest, hast thou seen a
more valiant knight than i in all the known world; hast thou read in
history of any who has or had higher mettle in attack, more spirit in
maintaining it, more dexterity in wounding or skill in overthrowing?"

"the truth is," answered sancho, "that i have never read any history, for
i can neither read nor write, but what i will venture to

white ointment in the alforjas."

"all that might be well dispensed with," said don quixote, "if i had
remembered to make a vial of the balsam of fierabras, for time and
medicine are saved by one single drop."

"what vial and what balsam is that?" said sancho panza.

"it is a balsam," answered don quixote, "the receipt of which i have in
my memory, with which one need have no fear of death, or dread dying of
any wound; and so when i make it and give it to thee thou hast nothing to

supreme liquor, for i am persuaded it will be worth more than two reals

and honour; but it remains to be told if it costs much to make it."

"with less than three reals, six quarts of it may be made," said don
quixote.

"sinner that i am!" said sancho, "then why does your worship put off
making it and teaching it to me?"

"peace, friend," answered don quixote; "greater secrets i mean to teach
thee and greater favours to bestow upon thee; and for the present let us
see to the dressing, for my ear pains me more than i could wish."

sancho took out some lint and ointment from the alforjas; but when don

and clapping his hand upon his sword and raising his eyes to heaven, be

"thou art wrong there," said don quixote, "for we shall not have been
above two hours among these cross-roads before we see more men in armour
than came to albraca to win the fair angelica."

"enough," said sancho; "so be it then, and god grant us success, and that

come, and then let me die."

me great pain."

"i have here an onion and a little cheese and a few scraps of bread,"
said sancho, "but they are not victuals fit for a valiant knight like
your worship."

"how little thou knowest about it," answered don quixote; "i would have
thee to know, sancho, that it is the glory of knights-errant to go
without eating for a month, and even when they do eat, that it should be
of what comes first to hand; and this would have been clear to thee hadst
thou read as many histories as i have, for, though they are very many,
among them all i have found no mention made of knights-errant eating,
unless by accident or at some sumptuous banquets prepared for them, and

"pardon me, your worship," said sancho, "for, as i cannot read or write,
as i said just now, i neither know nor comprehend the rules of the
profession of chivalry: henceforward i will stock the alforjas with every
kind of dry fruit for your worship, as you are a knight; and for myself,
as i am not one, i will furnish them with poultry and other things more
substantial."

"i do not say, sancho," replied don quixote, "that it is imperative on
knights-errant not to eat anything else but the fruits thou speakest of;
only that their more usual diet must be those, and certain herbs they
found in the fields which they knew and i know too."

"a good thing it is," answered sancho, "to know those herbs, for to my
thinking it will be needful some day to put that knowledge into
practice."

and here taking out what he said he had brought, the pair made their

e to reach some habitation before night set in; but
daylight and the hope of succeeding in their object failed them close by
the huts of some goatherds, so they determined to pass the night there,
and it was as much to sancho's discontent not to have reached a house, as
it was to his master's satisfaction to sleep under the open heaven, for
he fancied that each time this happened to him he performed an act of
ownership that helped to prove his chivalry.

what befell don quixote with certain goatherds


he was cordially welcomed by the goatherds, and sancho, having as best he
could put up rocinante and the ass, drew towards the fragrance that came
from some pieces of salted goat simmering in a pot on the fire; and
though he would have liked at once to try if they were ready to be
transferred from the pot to the stomach, he refrained from doing so as
the goatherds removed them from the fire, and laying sheepskins on the
ground, quickly spread their rude table,

and with signs of hearty
good-will invited them both to share what they had. round the skins six
of the men belonging to the fold seated themselves, having first with
rough politeness pressed don quixote to take a seat upon a trough which
they placed for him upside down. don quixote seated himself, and sancho
remained standing to serve the cup, which was made of horn. seeing him
standing, his master said to him:

"that thou mayest see, sancho, the good that knight-errantry contains in
itself, and how those who fill any office in it are on the high road to
be speedily honoured and esteemed by the world, i desire that thou seat
thyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people, and
that thou be one with me who am thy master and natural lord, and that

rced to chew slowly, drink little, wipe
my mouth every minute, and cannot sneeze or cough if i want or do other
things that are the privileges of liberty and solitude. so, senor, as for
these honours which your worship would put upon me as a servant and
follower of knight-errantry, exchange them for other things which may be
of more use and advantage to me; for these, though i fully acknowledge
them as received, i renounce from this moment to the end of the world."

"for all that," said don quixote, "thou must seat thyself, because him
who humbleth himself god exalteth;" and seizing him by the arm he forced
him to sit down beside himself.

the goatherds did not understand this jargon about squires and
knights-errant, and all they did was to eat in silence and stare at their
guests, who with great elegance and appetite were stowing away pieces as
big as one's fist. the course of meat finished, they spread upon the
sheepskins a great heap of parched acorns, and with them they put do

half cheese harder than if it had been made of mortar. all this while the
horn was not idle, for it went round so constantly, now full, now empty,
like the bucket of a water-wheel, that it soon drained one of the two
wine-skins that were in sight. when don quixote had quite appeased his
appetite he took up a handful of the acorns, and contemplating them
attentively delivered himself somewhat in this fashion:

"happy the age, happy the time, to which the ancients gave the name of
golden, not because in that fortunate age the gold so coveted in this our
iron one was gained without toil, but because they that lived in it knew
not the two words "mine" and "thine"! in that blessed age all things were
in common; to win the daily food no labour was requ

ld thank you for yours."

all this long harangue (which might very well have been spared) our
knight delivered because the acorns they gave him reminded him of the
golden age; and the whim seized him to address all this unnecessary
argument to the goatherds, who listened to him gaping in amazement
without saying a word in reply. sancho likewise held his peace and ate
acorns, and paid repeated visits to the second wine-skin, which they had
hung up on a cork tree to keep the wine cool.

don quixote was longer in talking than the supper in finishing, at the
end of which one of the goatherds said, "that your worship, senor
knight-errant, may say with more truth that we show you hospitality with
ready good-will, we will give you amusement and pleasure by making one of
our comrades sing: he will be here before long, and he is a very
intelligent youth and deep in love, and what is more he can read and
write and play on the rebeck to perfection."

the goatherd had hardly done speaking,

here the goatherd brought his song to an end, and though don quixote
entreated him to sing more, sancho had no mind that way, being more
inclined for sleep than for listening to songs; so said he to his master,
"your worship will do well to settle at once where you mean to pass the
night, for the labour these good men are at all day does not allow them
to spend the night in singing."

"i understand thee, sancho," replied don quixote; "i perceive clearly
that those visits to the wine-skin demand compensation in sleep rather
than in music."

"it's sweet

"i do not deny it," replied don quixote; "but settle thyself where thou
wilt; those of my calling are more becomingly employed in watching than
in sleeping; still it would be as well if thou wert to dress this ear for
me again, for it is giving me more pain than it need."

sancho did as he bade him, but one of the goatherds, seeing the wound,
told him not to be uneasy, as he would apply a remedy with which it would
be soon healed; and gathering some leaves of rosemary, of which there was
a great quantity there, he chewed them

and applying them to the ear he secured them firmly with a bandage,

of what a goatherd related to those with don quixote


just then another young man, one of those who fetched their provisions
from the village, came up and said, "do you know what is going on in the
village, comrades?"

"how could we know it?" replied one of them.

"well, then, you must know," continued the young man, "this morning that
famous student-shepherd called chrysostom died, and it is rumoured that
he died of love for that devil of a village girl the daughter of
guillermo the rich, she that wanders about the wolds here in the

even if i knew i
should not return to the village tomorrow."

"we will do the same," answered the goatherds, "and cast lots to see who
must stay to mind the goats of all."

"thou sayest well, pedro," said one, "though there will be no need of
taking that trouble, for i will stay behind for all; and don't suppose it
is virtue or want of curiosity in me; it is that the splinter that ran
into my foot the other day will not let me walk."

"for all that, we thank thee," answered pedro.

don quixote asked pedro to tell him who the dead man was and who the
shepherdess, to which pedro replied that all he knew was that the dead
man was a wealthy gentleman belonging to a village in those mountains,
who had been a student at salamanca for many years, at the end of which
he returned to his village with the reputation of being very learned and
deeply read. "above all, they said, he was learned in the science of the
stars and of what went on yonder in the heavens and the sun and the moon,

or he told us of the cris of the sun and moon to exact time."

"eclipse it is called, friend, not cris, the darkening of those two
luminaries," said don quixote; but pedro, not troubling himself with
trifles, went on with his story, saying, "also he foretold when the year
was going to be one of abundance or estility."

"sterility, you mean," said don quixote.

"sterility or estility," answered pedro, "it is all the same in the end.
and i can tell you that by this his father and friends who believed him
grew very rich because they did as he advised them, bidding them 'sow
barley this year, not wheat; this year you may sow pulse and not barley;
the next there will be a full oil crop, and the three following not a
drop will be got.'"

"that science is called astrology," said don quixote.

"i do not know what it is called," replied pedro, "b

to be known that he had changed his dress with no other object than to
wander about these wastes after that shepherdess marcela our lad
mentioned a while ago, with whom the deceased chrysostom had fallen in
love. and i must tell you now, for it is well you should know it, who
this girl is; perhaps, and even without any perhaps, you will not have
heard anything like it all the days of your life, though you should live
more years than sarna."

"say sarra," said don quixote, unable to endure the goatherd's confusion
of words.

"the sarna lives long enough," answered pedro; "and if, senor, you must
go finding fault with words at every step, we shall not make an end of it
this twelvemonth."

"pardon me, friend," said don quixote; "but, as there is such a
difference between sarna and sarra, i told you of it; however, you have
answered very rightly, for sarna lives longer than sarra: so continue
your story, and i will not object any more to anything."

the custody of the girl's property brought him while he put off her
marriage; and, faith, this was said in praise of the good priest in more

these little villages everything is talked about and everything is carped
at, and rest assured, as i am, that the priest must be over and above
good who forces his parishioners to speak well of him, especially in
villages."

"that is the truth," said don quixote; "but go on, for the story is very
good, and you, good pedro, tell it with very good grace."

"may that of the lord not be wanting to me," said pedro; "that is the one
to have. to proceed; you must know that though the uncle put before his
niece and described to her the qualities of each one in particular of the
many who had asked her in marriage, begging her to marry and make a
choice according to her own taste, she never gave any other answer than
that she had no desire to marry just

ure so formidable and gaining possession of a beauty so supreme. all
that i have told you being such well-established truth, i am persuaded
that what they say of the cause of chrysostom's death, as our lad told
us, is the same. and so i advise you, senor, fail not to be present
to-morrow at his burial, which will be well worth seeing, for chrysostom
had many friends, and it is not half a league from this place to where he
directed he should be buried."

"i will make a point of it," said don quixote, "and i thank you for the
pleasure you have given me by relating so interesting a tale."

"oh," said the goatherd, "i do not know even the half of what has
happened to the lovers of marcela, but perhaps to-morrow we may fall in
with some shepherd on the road who can tell us; and now it will be well
for you to go and sleep under cover, for the night air may hurt your
wound, though with the remedy i have applied to you there is no fear of
an untoward result."

and passed all the rest of the night in thinking of his lady dulcinea, in
imitation of the lovers of marcela. sancho panza settled himself between
rocinante and his ass, and slept, not like a lover who had been
discarded, but like a man who had been soundly kicked.

in which is ended the story of the shepherdess marcela, with other
incidents

bit hardly had day begun to show itself through the balconies of the
east, when five of the six goatherds came to rouse don quixote and tell
him that if he was still of a mind to go and see the famous burial of
chrysostom they would bear him company. don quixote, who desired nothing
better, rose and ordered sancho to saddle and pannel at once, which he
did with all despatch, and with the same they all set out forthwith. they
had not gone a quarter of a league when at the meeting of two paths they
saw coming towards them some six shepherds dressed in black sheepskins
and with their heads crowned with garlands of cypre

the burial, so they went on all together.

one of those on horseback addressing his companion said to him, "it seems
to me, senor vivaldo, that we may reckon as well spent the delay we shall
incur in seeing this remarkable funeral, for remarkable it cannot but be
judging by the strange things these shepherds have told us, of both the
dead shepherd and homicide shepherdess."

"so i think too," replied vivaldo, "and i would delay not to say a day,
but four, for the sake of seeing it."

don quixote asked them what it was they had heard of marcela and
chrysostom. the traveller answered that the same morning they had met
these shepherds, and seeing them dressed in this mournful fashion they
had asked them the reason of their appearing in such a guise; which one
of them gave, describing the strange behaviour and beauty of a
shepherdess called marcela, and the loves of many who courted her,
together with the death of that chrysostom to whose burial they were
going. in short, he repeate

this conversation dropped, and another was commenced by him who was
called vivaldo asking don quixote what was the reason that led him to go
armed in that fashion in a country so peaceful. to which don quixote
replied, "the pursuit of my calling does not allow or permit me to go in
any other fashion; easy life, enjoyment, and repose were invented for
soft courtiers, but toil, unrest, and arms were invented and made for
those alone whom the world calls knights-errant, of whom i, though
unworthy, am the least of all."

the instant they heard this all set him down as mad, and the better to
settle the point and discover what kind of madness his was, vivaldo
proceeded to ask him what knights-erra

nt meant.

"have not your worships," replied don quixote, "read the annals and
histories of england, in which are recorded the famous deeds of king
arthur, whom we in our popular castilian invariably call king artus, with
regard to whom it is an ancient tradition, and commonly received all over
that kingdom of great britain, that this king did not die, but was
changed by magic art into a raven, and that in process of time he is to
return to reign and recover his kingdom and sceptre; for which reason it
cannot be proved that from that time to t

his chivalry, of which, as i have already said, i, though a sinner, have
made profession, and what the aforesaid knights professed that same do i
profess, and so i go through these solitudes and wilds seeking
adventures, resolved in soul to oppose my arm and person to the most
perilous that fortune may offer me in aid of the weak and needy."

by these words of his the travellers were able to satisfy themselves of
don quixote's being out of his senses and of the form of madness that
overmastered him, at which they felt the same astonishment that all felt
on first becoming acquainted with it; and vivaldo, who was a person of
great shrewdness and of a lively temperament, in order to beguile the
short journey which they said was required to reach the mountain, the
scene of the burial, sought to give him an opportunity of going on with
his absurdities. so he said to him, "it seems to me, senor knight-errant,

in the world, and i imagine even that of the carthusian monks is not so
austere."

"as austere it may perhaps be," replied our don quixote, "but so
necessary for the world i am very much inclined to doubt. for, if the
truth is to be told, the soldier who executes what his captain orders
does no less than the captain himself who gives the order. my meaning,
is, that churchmen in peace and quiet pray to heaven for the welfare of
the world, but we soldiers and knights carry into effect what they pray
for, defending it with the might of our arms and the edge of our swords,
not under shelter but in the open air, a target for the

nights-errant, and that is that
when they find themselves about to engage in some mighty and perilous
adventure in which there is manifest danger of losing their lives, they
never at the moment of engaging in it think of commending themselves to
god, as is the duty of every good christian in like peril; instead of
which they commend themselves to their ladies with as much devotion as if
these were their gods, a thing which seems to me to savour somewhat of
heathenism."

"sir," answered don quixote, "that cannot be on any account omitted, and
the knight-errant would be disgraced who acted otherwise: for it is usual
and customary in knight-errantry that the knight-errant, who on engaging
in any great feat of arms has his lady before him, should turn his eyes
towards her softly and lovingly, as though with them entreating her to
favour and protect him in the hazardous venture he is about to undertake,
and even though no one hear him, he is bound to say certain words between

 of his
horse that he can help falling to the ground; but i know not how the dead
man had time to commend himself to god in the course of such rapid work
as this; it would have been better if those words which he spent in
commending himself to his lady in the midst of his career had been
devoted to his duty and obligation as a christian. moreover, it is my
belief that all knights-errant have not ladies to commend themselves to,
for they are not all in love."

"that is impossible," said don quixote: "i say it is impossible that
there could be a knight-errant without a lady, because to such it is as
natural and proper to be in love as to the heavens to have stars: most
certainly no history has been seen in which there is to be found a
knight-errant without an amour, and for the simple reason that without
one he would be held no legitimate knight but a bastard, and one who had
gained entrance into the stronghold of the said knighthood, not by the
door, but over the wall like a thief

and a robber."

"nevertheless," said the traveller, "if i remember rightly, i think i
have read that don galaor, the brother of the valiant amadis of gaul,
never had any special lady to whom he might commend himself, and yet he
was not the less esteemed, and was a very stout and famous knight."

to which our don quixote made answer, "sir, one solitary swallow does not
make summer; moreover, i know that knight was in secret very deeply in
love; besides which, that way of falling in love with all that took his
fancy was a natural propensity which he could not control. but, in short,
it is very manifest that he had one alone whom he made mistress of his
will, to whom he commended himself very frequently and very secretly, for
he prided himself on being a reticent knight."

"then if it be essential that ev
 
 ___________________________
 
t-errant should be in love,"
said the traveller, "it may be fairly supposed that your worship is so,
as you are of the order; and if you do not pride yourself on being as
reticent as don galaor, i entreat you as earnestly as i can, in the name
of all this company and in my own, to inform us of the name, country,
rank, and beauty of your lady, for she will esteem herself fortunate if
all the world knows that she is loved and served by such a knight as your
worship seems to be."

at this don quixote heaved a deep sigh and said, "i cannot say positively
whether my sweet enemy is pleased or not that the world should know i
serve her; i can only say in answer to what has been so courteously asked
of me, that her name is dulcinea, her country el toboso, a village of la
mancha, her rank must be at least that of a princess, since she is my
queen and lady, and her beauty superhuman, since all the impossible and
fanciful attributes of beauty which the poets apply to their ladies are

d in her; for her hairs are gold, her forehead elysian fields, her
eyebrows rainbows, her eyes suns, her cheeks roses, her lips coral, her
teeth pearls, her neck alabaster, her bosom marble, her hands ivory, her
fairness snow, and what modesty conceals from sight such, i think and
imagine, as rational reflection can only extol, not compare."

"we should like to know her lineage, race, and ancestry," said vivaldo.

to which don quixote replied, "she is not of the ancient roman curtii,
caii, or scipios, nor of the modern colonnas or orsini, nor of the
moncadas or requesenes of catalonia, nor yet of the rebellas or
villanovas of valencia; palafoxes, nuzas, rocabertis, corellas, lunas,
alagones, urreas, foces, or gurreas of aragon; cerdas, manriques,
mendozas, or guzmans of castile; alencastros, pallas, or meneses of
portugal; but she is of those of el toboso of la mancha, a lineage that
though modern, may furnish a sourc

dispute with me save on the condition that zerbino placed at the foot of
the trophy of orlando's arms, saying,

'these let none move who dareth not his might with roland prove.'"

"although mine is of the cachopins of laredo," said the traveller, "i
will not venture to compare it with that of el toboso of la mancha,
though, to tell the truth, no such surname has until now ever reached my
ears."

"what!" said don quixote, "has that never reached them?"

the rest of the party went along listening with great attention to the
conversation of the pair, and even the very goatherds and shepherds
perceived how exceedingly out of his wits our don quixote was. sancho
panza alone thought that what his master said was the truth, knowing who
he was and having known him from his birth; and all that he felt any
difficulty in believing was that about the fair dulcinea del toboso,
because neither any such name nor any

covered with a great variety of flowers and branches, on seeing which one
of the goatherds said, "those who come there are the bearers of
chrysostom's body, and the foot of that mountain is the place where he
ordered them to bury him." they therefore made haste to reach the spot,
and did so by the time those who came had laid the bier upon the ground,
and four of them with sharp pickaxes were digging a grave by the side of
a hard rock. they greeted each other courteously, and then don quixote
and those who accompanied him turned to examine the bier, and on it,
covered with flowers, they saw a dead body in the dress of a shepherd, to
all appearance of one thirty years of age, and showing even in death that
in life he had been of comely features and gallant bearing. around him on
the bier itself were laid some books, and several papers open and folded;
and those who were looking on as well as those who were opening the grave
and all the others who were there preserved a strange

that he saw for the first time that mortal enemy of the human race, and
here, too, for the first time he declared to her his passion, as
honourable as it was devoted, and here it was that at last marcela ended
by scorning and rejecting him so as to bring the tragedy of his wretched
life to a close; here, in memory of misfortunes so great, he desired to
be laid in the bowels of eternal oblivion." then turning to don quixote
and the travellers he went on to say, "that body, sirs, on which you are
looking with compassionate eyes, was the abode of a soul on which heaven
bestowed a vast share of its riches. that is the body of chrysostom, who
was unrivalled in wit, unequalled in courtesy, unapproached in gentle
bearing, a phoenix in friendship, generous without limit, grave without
arrogance, gay without vulgarity, and, in short, first in all that
constitutes goodness and second to none in all that makes up mis

into the thickest part of a wood that was hard by, leaving all who were

some--those wounded by the irresistible shafts launched by her bright
eyes--made as though they would follow her, heedless of the frank
declaration they had heard; seeing which, and deeming this a fitting
occasion for the exercise of his chivalry in aid of distressed damsels,
don quixote, laying his hand on the hilt of his sword, exclaimed in a
loud and distinct voice:

"let no one, whatever his rank or condition, dare to follow the beautiful
marcela, under pain of incurring my fierce indignation. she has shown by
clear and satisfactory arguments that little or no fault is to be found
with her for the death of chrysostom, and also how far she is from
yielding to the wishes of any of her lovers, for which reason, instead of
being followed and persecuted, she should in ju

whether it was because of the threats of don quixote, or because ambrosio
told them to fulfil their duty to their good friend, none of the
shepherds moved or stirred from the spot until, having finished the grave
and burned chrysostom's papers, they laid his body in it, not without
many tears from those who stood by. they closed the grave with a heavy
stone until a slab was ready which ambrosio said he meant to have
prepared, with an epitaph which was to be to this effect:

the body of a lover lies;

they then strewed upon the grave a profusion of flowers and branches, and
all expressing their condolence with his friend ambrosio, took their
vivaldo and his companion did the same; and don quixote bade farewell to
his hosts and to the travellers, who pressed him to come with them to
seville, as being such a convenient place for finding adventures, for
they presented themselves in every street and round every corner oftener
than anywhere else. don quixote thanked them for their advice and for the
disposition they showed to do him a favour, and said that for the present
he would not, and must not go to seville until he had cleared all these
mountains of highwaymen and robbers, of wh

seeing his good intention, the travellers were unwilling to press him
further, and once more bidding him farewell, they left him and pursued
their journey, in the course of which they did not fail to discuss the
story of marcela and chrysostom as well as the madness of don quixote.
he, on his part, resolved to go in quest of the shepherdess marcela, and
make offer to her of all the service he could render her; but things did
not fall out with him as he expected, according to what is related in the
course of this veracious history, of which the second part ends here.

soon as don quixote took
leave of his hosts and all who had been present at the burial of
chrysostom, he and his squire passed into the same wood which they had
seen the shepherdess marcela enter, and after having wandered for more
than two hours in all directions in search of her without finding her,
they came to a halt in a glade covered with tender grass, beside which
ran a pleasant cool stream that invited and compelled them to pass there
the hours of the noontide heat, which by this time was beginning

on oppressively. don quixote and sancho dismounted, and turning rocinante
and the ass loose to feed on the grass that was there in abundance, they
ransacked the alforjas, and without any ceremony very peacefully and
sociably master and man made their repast on what they found in them.

sancho had not thought it worth while to hobble rocinante, feeling sure,
from what he knew of his staidness and freedom from incontinence, that
all the mares in the cordova pastures would not lead him into an
impropriety. chance, how

ever, and the devil, who is not always asleep, so
ordained it that feeding in this valley there was a drove of galician
ponies belonging to certain yanguesan carriers, whose way it is to take
their midday rest with their teams in places and spots where grass and
water abound; and that where don quixote chanced to be suited the
yanguesans' purpose very well. it so happened, then, that rocinante took
a fancy to disport himself with their ladyships the ponies, and
abandoning his usual gait and demeanour as he scented them, he, without
asking leave of his master, got up a briskish little trot and hastened to
make known his wishes to them; they, however, it seemed, preferred their
pasture to him, and received him with their heels and teeth to such
effect that they soon broke his girths and

left him naked without a
saddle to cover him; but what must have been worse to him was that the
carriers, seeing the violence he was offering to their mares, came
running up armed with stakes, and so belaboured him that they brought him
sorely battered to the ground.

by this time don quixote and sancho, who had witnessed the drubbing of
rocinante, came up panting, and said don quixote to sancho:

"so far as i can see, friend sancho, these are not knights but base folk
of low birth: i mention it because thou canst lawfully aid me in taking
due vengeance for the insult offered to rocinante before our eyes."

"what the devil vengeance can we take," answered sancho, "if they are
more than twenty, and we no more than two, or, indeed, perhaps not more
than one and a half?"

"i count for a hundred," replied don quixote, and without more words he
drew his sword and attack

ed and impelled by
the example of his master, sancho did the same; and to begin with, don
quixote delivered a slash at one of them that laid open the leather
jerkin he wore, together with a great portion of his shoulder. the
yanguesans, seeing themselves assaulted by only two men while they were
so many, betook themselves to their stakes, and driving the two into the
middle they began to lay on with great zeal and energy; in fact, at the
second blow they brought sancho to the ground, and don quixote fared the
same way, all his skill and high mettle availing him nothing, and fate
willed it that he should fall at the feet of rocinante, who had not yet
risen; whereby it may be seen how furiously stakes can pound in angry
boorish hands.

then, seeing the mischief they had done, the yanguesans with all the
haste they could loaded their team and pursued their journey, leaving the
two adventurers a sorry sight and in sorrier mood.

he called to him in a weak and doleful voice, "senor don quixote, ah,

"what wouldst thou, brother sancho?" answered don quixote in the same
feeble suffering tone as sancho.

"i would like, if it were possible," answered sancho panza, "your worship
to give me a couple of sups of that potion of the fiery blas, if it be
that you have any to hand there; perhaps it will serve for broken bones
as well as for wounds."

"if i only had it here, wretch that i am, what more should we want?" said
don quixote; "but i swear to thee, sancho panza, on the faith of a
knight-errant, ere two days are over, unless fortune orders

mean to have it in my possession, or my hand will have lost its cunning."

"but in how many does your worship think we shall have the use of our
feet?" answered sancho panza.

"for myself i must say i cannot guess how many," said the battered knight
don quixote; "but i take all the blame upon myself, for i had no business
to put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed knights like
myself, and so i believe that in punishment for having transgressed the
laws of chivalry the god of battles has permitted this chastisement to be
administered to me; for which reason, brother sancho, it is well thou
shouldst receive a hint on the matter which i am now about to mention to
thee, for it is of much importance to the welfare of both of us. it is at

thrashing. i never thought it of rocinante, for i took him to be a
virtuous person and as quiet as myself. after all, they say right that it
takes a long time to come to know people, and that there is nothing sure
in this life. who would have said that, after such mighty slashes as your
worship gave that unlucky knight-errant, there was coming, travelling
post and at the very heels of them, such a great storm of sticks as has
fallen upon our shoulders?"

"and yet thine, sancho," replied don quixote, "ought to be used to such
squalls; but mine, reared in soft cloth and fine linen, it is plain they
must feel more keenly the pain of this mishap, and if it were not that i
imagine--why do i say imagine?--know of a certainty that all these
annoyances are very necessary accompaniments of the calling of arms, i
would lay me down here to die of pure vexation."

to this the squire replied, "senor, as these mishaps are what one reaps
of chivalry, tell me if they happen very often, or if they

fixed times for coming to pass; because it seems to me that after two
harvests we shall be no good for the third, unless god in his infinite
mercy helps us."

"know, friend sancho," answered don quixote, "that the life of
knights-errant is subject to a thousand dangers and reverses, and neither
more nor less is it within immediate possibility for knights-errant to
become kings and emperors, as experience has shown in the case of many
different knights with whose histories i am thoroughly acquainted; and i

their sticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and

thinking of whether all those stake-strokes were an indignity or not
gives me no uneasiness, which the pain of the blows does, for they will
remain as deeply impressed on my memory as on my shoulders."

"for all that let me tell thee, brother panza," said don quixote, "that
there is no recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain
which death does not remove."

"and what greater misfortune can there be," replied panza, "than the one
that waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? if our
mishap were one of those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it
would not be so bad; but i am beginning to think that all the plasters in
a hospital almost won't be enough to put us right."

"no more of that: pluck strength out o

do," returned don quixote, "and let us see how rocinante is, for it seems
to me that not the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of
the poor beast."

"there is nothing wonderful in that," replied sancho, "since he is a
knight-errant too; what i wonder at is that my beast should have come off
scot-free where we come out scotched."

"fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief
to it," said don quixote; "i say so because this little beast may now
supply the want of rocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where i
may be cured of my wounds. and moreover i shall not hold it any dishonour
to be so mounted, for i remember having read how the good old silenus,
the tutor and instructor of the gay god of laughter, when he entered the
city of the hundred gates, went very contentedly mounted on a handsome
ass."

"it may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered
sancho, "

but there is a great difference between going mounted and going
slung like a sack of manure."

to which don quixote replied, "wounds received in battle confer honour
instead of taking it away; and so, friend panza, say no more, but, as i
told thee before, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy
beast in whatever fashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere
night come on and surprise us in these wilds."

"and yet i have heard your worship say," observed panza, "that it is very
meet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they
esteem it very good fortune."

one of these was amadis, when, under the name of beltenebros, he took up
his abode on the pena pobre for--i know not if it was eight years or

and execrations on whomsoever it was that had brought him there, he
raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a turkish bow without power
to bring himself upright, but with all his pains he saddled his ass, who
too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to the excessive licence of the
day; he next raised up rocinante, and as for him, had he possessed a
tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither sancho nor his master
would have been behind him.

to be brief, sancho fixed don quixote on the ass and secured rocinante
with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, he proceeded more
or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high road might
be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to
better, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and
on it he perceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of
don quixote must needs be a castle. sancho insisted that it was an inn,

of what happened to the ingenious gentleman in the inn which he took to
be a castle


the innkeeper, seeing don quixote slung across the ass, asked sancho what
was amiss with him. sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had
fallen down from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. the innkeeper
had a wife whose disposition was not such as those of her calling
commonly have, for she was by nature kind-hearted and felt for the
sufferings of her neighbours, so she at once set about tending don
quixote, and made her young daughter, a very comely girl, help her in
taking care of her guest. there was

 besides in the inn, as servant, an
asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of one
eye and not very sound in the other. the elegance of her shape, to be
sure, made up for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from
head to foot, and her shoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made
her contemplate the ground more than she liked. this graceful lass, then,
helped the young girl, and the two made up a very bad bed for don quixote
in a garret that showed evident signs of having formerly served for many
years as a straw-loft, in which there was also quartered a carrier whose
bed was placed a little beyond our don quixote's, and, though only made
of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the advantage of
it, as don quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a
quilt, full of pellets which, were they not seen through th

wool, would to the touch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made
of buckler leather, and a coverlet the threads of which anyone that chose
might have counted without missing one in the reckoning.

on this accursed bed don quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and
her daughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while
maritornes--for that was the name of the asturian--held the light for
them, and while plastering him, the hostess, observing how full of wheals
don quixote was in some places, remarked that this had more the look of
blows than of a fall.

it was not blows, sancho said, but that the rock had many points and
projections, and that each of them had left its mark. "pray, senora," he

dy aches so that i feel as if i had had a thousand
thwacks."

"that may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened
to me to dream that i was falling down from a tower and never coming to
the ground, and when i awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and
shaken as if i had really fallen."

"there is the point, senora," replied sancho panza, "that i without
dreaming at all, but being more awake than i am now, find myself with
scarcely less wheals than my master, don quixote."

"how is the gentleman called?" asked maritornes the asturian.

"don quixote of la mancha," answered sancho panza, "and he is a
knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen
in the world this long time past."

"what is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass.

"are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered sancho panza.
"well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing
that in two words is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day

rld, and to-morrow will have two or
three crowns of kingdoms to give his squire."

"then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master
as this, you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a
county?"

"it is too soon yet," answered sancho, "for we have only been a month
going in quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that
can be called one, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for
another thing is found; however, if my master don quixote gets well of
this wound, or fall, and i am left none the worse of it, i would not
change my hopes for the best title in spain."

to all this conversation don quixote was listening very attentively, and
sitting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand
he said to her, "believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate
in having in this castle of yours sheltered my person, which is such that
if i do not myself praise it, it is because of what is commonly said,

family asleep she would come in search of him and meet his wishes
unreservedly. and it is said of this good lass that she never made
promises of the kind without fulfilling them, even though she made them
in a forest and without any witness present, for she plumed herself
greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an
employment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and
ill-luck had brought her to that position. the hard, narrow, wretched,
rickety bed of don quixote stood first in the middle of this star-lit
stable, and close beside it sancho made his, which merely consisted of a
rush mat and a blanket that looked as if it was of threadbare canvas
rather than of wool. next to these two beds was that of the carrier, made
up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings of the
two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump,
and in prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of arevalo,

to proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them
their second feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and
lay waiting for his conscientious maritornes. sancho was by this time
plastered and had lain down, and though he strove to sleep the pain of
his ribs would not let him, while don quixote with the pain of his had
his eyes as wide open as a hare's.

the inn was all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light
except that given by a lantern that hung burning in the middle of the
gateway. this strange stillness, and the thoughts, always present to our
knight's mind, of the incidents described at every turn in the books that
were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to his imagination as
extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was that he

though the queen guinevere herself and the dame quintanona should present

while he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the
hour--an unlucky one for him--arrived for the asturian to come, who in
her smock, with bare feet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with
noiseless and cautious steps entered the chamber where the three were
quartered, in quest of the carrier; but scarcely had she gained the door
when don quixote perceived her, and sitting up in his bed in spite of his
plasters and the pain of his ribs, he stretched out his arms to receive
his beauteous damsel. the asturian, who went all doubled up and in
silence with her hands before her feeling for her lover, encountered the
arms of don quixote, who grasped her tightly by the wrist, and drawing
her towards him, while she dared not utter a word, made her sit down on
the bed. he then felt her smock, and although it was of sackcloth it

maritornes was fretting and sweating at finding herself held so fast by
don quixote, and not understanding or heeding the words he addressed to
her, she strove without speaking to free herself. the worthy carrier,
whose unholy thoughts kept him awake, was aware of his doxy the moment
she entered the door, and was listening attentively to all don quixote
said; and jealous that the asturian should have broken her word with him
for another, drew nearer to don quixote's bed and stood still to see what
would come of this talk which he could not understand; but when he

a certain share fell upon maritornes, who,
irritated by the pain and flinging modesty aside, paid back so many in
return to sancho that she woke him up in spite of himself. he then,
finding himself so handled, by whom he knew not, raising himself up as
well as he could, grappled with maritornes, and he and she between them
began the bitterest and drollest scrimmage in the world. the carrier,
however, perceiving by the light of the innkeeper candle how it fared
with his ladylove, quitting don quixote, ran to bring her the help she
needed; and the innkeeper did the same but with a different intention,
for his was to chastise the lass, as he believed that beyond a doubt she
alone was the cause of all the harmony. and so, as the saying is, cat to
rat, rat to rope, rope to stick, the carrier pounded sancho, sancho the
lass, she him, and the innkeeper her, and all worked away so briskly that
they did not give themselves a moment's rest; and the best of it was that

sound spot left where a hand could light.

it so happened that there was lodging that night in the inn a caudrillero
of what they call the old holy brotherhood of toledo, who, also hearing
the extraordinary noise of the conflict, seized his staff and the tin
case with his warrants, and made his way in the dark into the room
crying: "hold! in the name of the jurisdiction! hold! in the name of the
holy brotherhood!"

the first that he came upon was the pummelled don quixote, who lay
stretched senseless on his back upon his broken-down bed, and, his hand
falling on the beard as he felt about, he continued to cry, "help for the
jurisdiction!" but perceiving that he whom he had laid hold of did not
move or stir, he concluded that he was dead and that those in the room
were his murderers, and with this suspicion he raised his voice still
higher, calling out, "shut the inn gate; see that no one goes out; they
have killed a man here!" this cry startled them all,

and each dropped the
contest at the point at which the voice reached him. the innkeeper
retreated to his room, the carrier to his pack-saddles, the lass to her
crib; the unlucky don quixote and sancho alone were unable to move from
where they were. the cuadrillero on this let go don quixote's beard, and
went out to look for a light to search for and apprehend the culprits;
but not finding one, as the innkeeper had purposely extinguished the
lantern on retreating to his room, he was compelled to have recourse to
the hearth, where after much time and trouble he lit another lamp.

by this time don quixote had recovered from his swoon; and in the same
tone of voice in which he had called to his squire the day before when he
lay stretched "in the vale of the stakes," he began calling to him now,
"sancho, my friend, art thou asleep? sleepest thou, friend sancho?"

"how can i sleep, curses on it!" returned sancho discontentedly and
bitterly, "when it is plain that all the devils have been at me this
night?"

"thou mayest well believe that," answered don quixote, "because, either i
know little, or this castle is enchanted, for thou must know-but this
that i am now about to tell thee thou must swear to keep secret until
after my death."

"i swear it," answered sancho.

"i say so," continued don quixote, "because i hate taking away anyone's
good name."

"i say," replied sancho, "that i swear to hold my tongue about it till
the end of your worship's days, and god grant i may be able to let it out
tomorrow."

"it is not for that," replied sancho, "but because i hate keeping things

"at any rate," said don quixote, "i have more confidence in thy affection
and good nature; and so i would have thee know that this night there
befell me one of the strangest adventures that i could describe, and to
relate it to thee briefly thou must know that a little while ago the
daughter of the lord of this castle came to me, and that she is the most

all my life? unlucky me and the mother that bore me! for i am not a
knight-errant and never expect to be one, and of all the mishaps, the
greater part falls to my share."

"then thou hast been thrashed too?" said don quixote.

"didn't i say so? worse luck to my line!" said sancho.

"be not distressed, friend," said don quixote, "for i will now make the
precious balsam with which we shall cure ourselves in the twinkling of an
eye."

by this time the cuadrillero had succeeded in lighting the lamp, and came
in to see the man that he thought had been killed; and as sancho caught

sancho; "if not, let my shoulders speak to the point."

"mine could speak too," said don quixote, "but that is not a sufficient
reason for believing that what we see is the enchanted moor."

the officer came up, and finding them engaged in such a peaceful
conversation, stood amazed; though don quixote, to be sure, still lay on
his back unable to move from pure pummelling and plasters. the officer
turned to him and said, "well, how goes it, good man?"

"i would speak more politely if i were you," replied don quixote; "is it
the way of this country to address knights-errant in that

the cuadrillero finding himself so disrespectfully treated by such a
sorry-looking individual, lost his temper, and raising the lamp full of
oil, smote don quixote such a blow with it on the head that he gave him a
badly broken pate; then, all being in darkness, he went out, and sancho
panza said, "that is certainly the enchanted moor, senor, and he keeps
the treasure for others, and for us only the cuffs and lamp-whacks."

"that is the truth," answered don quixote, "and there is no use in
troubling oneself about these matters of enchantment or being angry or
vexed at them, for as they are invisible and visionary we shall find no
one on whom to avenge ourselves, do what we may; rise, sancho, if thou
canst, and call the alcaide of this fortress, and get him to give me a
little oil, wine, salt, and rosemary to make the salutiferous balsam, for

nd of which he awoke and felt very great bodily relief and so much ease
from his bruises that he thought himself quite cured, and verily believed
he had hit upon the balsam of fierabras; and that with this remedy he
might thenceforward, without any fear, face any kind of destruction,
battle, or combat, however perilous it might be.

sancho panza, who also regarded the amendment of his master as
miraculous, begged him to give him what was left in the pigskin, which
was no small quantity. don quixote consented, and he, taking it with both
hands, in good faith and with a better will, gulped down and drained off
very little less than his master. but the fact is, that the stomach of
poor sancho was of necessity not so delicate as that of his master, and
so, before vomiting, he was seized with such gripings and retchings, and
such sweats and faintness, that verily and truly he believed his last
hour had come, and finding himself so racked and tormented he cursed the
balsam and the thief

that had given it to him.

don quixote seeing him in this state said, "it is my belief, sancho, that
this mischief comes of thy not being dubbed a knight, for i am persuaded
this liquor cannot be good for those who are not so."

"if your worship knew that," returned sancho--"woe betide me and all my
kindred!--why did you let me taste it?"

at this moment the draught took effect, and the poor squire began to
discharge both ways at such a rate that the rush mat on which he had
thrown himself and the canvas blanket he had cove

ring him were fit for
nothing afterwards. he sweated and perspired with such paroxysms and
convulsions that not only he himself but all present thought his end had
come. this tempest and tribulation lasted about two hours, at the end of
which he was left, not like his master, but so weak and exhausted that he
could not stand. don quixote, however, who, as has been said, felt
himself relieved and well, was eager to take his departure at once in
quest of adventures, as it seemed to him that all the time he loitered
there was a fraud upon the world and those in it who stood in need of his
help and protection, all the more when he had the security and confidence
his balsam afforded him; and so, urged by this impulse, he saddled
rocinante himself and put the pack-saddle on his squire's beast, whom
likewise he helped to dress

which i have received to procure you satisfaction and reparation to the
utmost of your desire."

the innkeeper replied to him with equal calmness, "sir knight, i do not
want your worship to avenge me of any wrong, because when any is done me
i can take what vengeance seems good to me; the only thing i want is that
you pay me the score that you have run up in the inn last night, as well
for the straw and barley for your two beasts, as for supper and beds."

"then this is an inn?" said don quixote.

"and a very respectable one," said the innkeeper.

"i have been under a mistake all this time," answered don quixote, "for
in truth i thought it was a castle, and not a bad one; but since it
appears that it is not a castle but an inn, all that can be done now is
that you should excuse the payment, for i cannot contravene the rule of
knights-errant, of whom i know as a fact (and up to the present i have
read nothing to the contrary) that they never paid for lodging or

heir due by law and right in return for the
insufferable toil they endure in seeking adventures by night and by day,
in summer and in winter, on foot and on horseback, in hunger and thirst,
cold and heat, exposed to all the inclemencies of heaven and all the
hardships of earth."

"i have little to do with that," replied the innkeeper; "pay me what you
owe me, and let us have no more talk of chivalry, for all i care about is
to get my money."

"you are a stupid, scurvy innkeeper," said don quixote, and putting spurs
to rocinante and bringing his pike to the slope he rode out of the inn
before anyone could stop him, and pushed on some distance without looking
to see if his squire was following him.

the innkeeper when he saw him go without paying him ran to get payment of
sancho, who said that as his master would not pay neither would he,
because, being as he was squire to a knight-errant, the same rule and
reason held good for him as for his master with regard to not paying

 he passed out very well pleased at having
paid nothing and carried his point, though it had been at the expense of
his usual sureties, his shoulders. it is true that the innkeeper detained
his alforjas in payment of what was owing to him, but sancho took his
departure in such a flurry that he never missed them. the innkeeper, as
soon as he saw him off, wanted to bar the gate close, but the blanketers
would not agree to it, for they were fellows who would not have cared two
farthings for don quixote, even had he been really one of the
knights-errant of the round table.

sancho reached his master so limp and faint that he could not urge on his
beast. when don quixote saw the state he was in he said, "i have now come
to the conclusion, good sancho, that this castle or inn is beyond a doubt
enchanted, because those who have so atrociously dive

 enchantments; and what i make out clearly from all this is, that
these adventures we go seeking will in the end lead us into such
misadventures that we shall not know which is our right foot; and that
the best and wisest thing, according to my small wits, would be for us to
return home, now that it is harvest-time, and attend to our business, and
give over wandering from zeca to mecca and from pail to bucket, as the
saying is."

"how little thou knowest about chivalry, sancho," replied don quixote;
"hold thy peace and have patience; the day will come when thou shalt see
with thine own eyes what an honourable thing it is to wander in the
pursuit of this calling; nay, tell me, what greater pleasure can there be
in the world, or what delight can equal that of winning a battle, and
triumphing over one's enemy? none, beyond all doubt."

"very likely," answered sancho, "though i do not know it; all i know is
that since we have been knights-errant, or since your worship has been

ord,' which was one of the best swords that ever knight in the
world possessed, for, besides having the said virtue, it cut like a
razor, and there was no armour, however strong and enchanted it might be,
that could resist it."

"such is my luck," said sancho, "that even if that happened and your
worship found some such sword, it would, like the balsam, turn out
serviceable and good for dubbed knights only, and as for the squires,
they might sup sorrow."

"fear not that, sancho," said don quixote: "heaven will deal better by
thee."

thus talking, don quixote and his squire were going along, when, on the
road they were following, don quixote perceived approaching them a large
and thick cloud of dust, on seeing which he turned to sancho and said:

"this is the day, sancho, on which will be seen the boon my fortune is
reserving for me; this, i say, is the day on which as much as on any
other shall be displayed the might of my arm, and on which i shall do
deeds that shall remain w

seest thou that cloud of dust which rises yonder? well, then, all that is
churned up by a vast army composed of various and countless nations that
comes marching there."

"according to that there must be two," said sancho, "for on this opposite
side also there rises just such another cloud of dust."

don quixote turned to look and found that it was true, and rejoicing
exceedingly, he concluded that they were two armies about to engage and
encounter in the midst of that broad plain; for at all times and seasons
his fancy was full of the battles, enchantments, adventures, crazy feats,
loves, and defiances that are recorded in the books of chivalry, and
everything he said, thought, or did had reference to such things. now the
cloud of dust he had seen was raised by two great droves of sheep coming

along the same road in opposite directions, which, because of the dust,
did not become visible until they drew near, but don quixote asserted so
positively that they were armies that sancho was led to believe it and
say, "well, and what are we to do, senor?"

"what?" said don quixote: "give aid and assistance to the weak and those
who need it; and thou must know, sancho, that this which comes opposite
to us is conducted and led by the mighty emperor alifanfaron, lord of the
great isle of trapobana; this other that marches behind me is that of his
enemy the king of the garamantas, pentapolin of the bare arm, for he
always goes into battle with his right arm bare."

"but why are these two lords such enemies?"

"they are at enmity," replied don quixote, "because this 
 
 ___________________________
 
alifanfaron is a
furious pagan and is in love with the daughter of pentapolin, who is a
very beautiful and moreover gracious lady, and a christian, and her
father is unwilling to bestow her upon the pagan king unless he first
abandons the religion of his false prophet mahomet, and adopts his own."

"by my beard," said sancho, "but pentapolin does quite right, and i will
help him as much as i can."

"in that thou wilt do what is thy duty, sancho," said don quixote; "for
to engage in battles of this sort it is not requisite to be a dubbed
knight."

"that i can well understand," answered sancho; "but where shall we put
this ass where we may be sure to find him after the fray is over? for i
believe it has not been the custom so far to go into battle on a beast of
this kind."

"that is true," said don quixote, "and what you had best do with him is
to leave him to take his chance whether he be lost or not, for the horses
we shall have when we come

out victors will be so many that even
rocinante will run a risk of being changed for another. but attend to me
and observe, for i wish to give thee some account of the chief knights
who accompany these two armies; and that thou mayest the better see and
mark, let us withdraw to that hillock which rises yonder, whence both
armies may be seen."

they did so, and placed themselves on a rising ground from which the two
droves that don quixote made armies of might have been plainly seen if
the clouds of dust they raised had not obscured them and blinded the
sight; nevertheless, seeing in his imagination what he did not see and
what did not exist, he began thus in a loud voice:

"that knight whom thou seest yonder in yellow armour, who bears upon his
shield a lion crowned crouching at the feet of a damsel, is the valiant
laurcalco, lord of the silver bridge; that one in armour with flowers of
gold, who bears on his shield thre

ellous readiness; brimful and saturated
with what he had read in his lying books! sancho panza hung upon his
words without speaking, and from time to time turned to try if he could
see the knights and giants his master was describing, and as he could not
make out one of them he said to him:

"senor, devil take it if there's a sign of any man you talk of, knight or
giant, in the whole thing; maybe it's all enchantment, like the phantoms
last night."

"how canst thou say that!" answered don quixote; "dost thou not hear the
neighing of the steeds, the braying of the trumpets, the roll of the
drums?"

"i hear nothing but a great bleating of ewes and sheep," said sancho;
which was true, for by this time the two flocks had come close.

"the fear thou art in, sancho," said don quixote, "prevents thee from
seeing or hearing correctly, for one of the effects of fear is to derange
the senses and make things appear different from what they are; if thou
art in such fear, withdraw to one s

ide and leave me to myself, for alone
i suffice to bring victory to that side to which i shall give my aid;"
and so saying he gave rocinante the spur, and putting the lance in rest,
shot down the slope like a thunderbolt. sancho shouted after him, crying,
"come back, senor don quixote; i vow to god they are sheep and ewes you
are charging! come back! unlucky the father that begot me! what madness
is this! look, there is no giant, nor knight, nor cats, nor arms, nor
shields quartered or whole, nor vair azure or bedevilled. what are you
about? sinner that i am before god!" but not for all these entreaties did
don quixote turn back; on the contrary he went on shouting out, "ho,
knights, ye who follow and fight under the banners of the valiant emperor
pentapolin of the ba

re arm, follow me all; ye shall see how easily i
shall give him his revenge over his enemy alifanfaron of the trapobana."

so saying, he dashed into the midst of the squadron of ewes, and began
spearing them with as much spirit and intrepidity as if he were
transfixing mortal enemies in earnest. the shepherds and drovers
accompanying the flock shouted to him to desist; seeing it was no use,
they ungirt their slings and began to salute his ears with stones as big
as one's fist. don quixote gave no heed to the stones, but, letting drive
right and left kept saying:

"where art thou, proud alifanfaron? come before me; i am a single knight
who would fain prove thy prowess hand to hand, and make thee yield thy
life a penalty for the wrong thou dost to the valiant pentapolin
garamanta." here came a sugar-plum from the brook that struck him on the
side and buried a couple of ribs in his body. feeling himself so smitten,
he imagined himself slain or badly wounded for certain, and

more than seven,
and made off without waiting to ascertain anything further.

all this time sancho stood on the hill watching the crazy feats his
master was performing, and tearing his beard and cursing the hour and the
occasion when fortune had made him acquainted with him. seeing him, then,
brought to the ground, and that the shepherds had taken themselves off,
he ran to him and found him in very bad case, though not unconscious; and
said he:

"did i not tell you to come back, senor don quixote; and that what you
were going to attack were not armies but droves of sheep?"

"that's how that thief of a sage, my enemy, can alter and falsify
things," answered don quixote; "thou must know, sancho, that it is a very
easy matter for those of his sort to make us believe what they choose;
and this malignant being who persecutes me, envious of the glory he knew
i was to win in this battle, has turned the squadrons of the enemy into
droves of sheep. at any rate, do this much, i beg of the

thee at first. but go not just yet, for i want thy help and assistance;
come hither, and see how many of my teeth and grinders are missing, for i
feel as if there was not one left in my mouth."

sancho came so close that he almost put his eyes into his mouth; now just
at that moment the balsam had acted on the stomach of don quixote, so, at
the very instant when sancho came to examine his mouth, he discharged all
its contents with more force than a musket, and full into the beard of
the compassionate squire.

"holy mary!" cried sancho, "what is this that has happened me? clearly
this sinner is mortally wounded, as he vomits blood from the mouth;" but
considering the matter a little more closely he perceived by the colour,
taste, and smell, that it was not blood but the balsam from the flask
which he had seen him d

aken with such a loathing that
his stomach turned, and he vomited up his inside over his very master,
and both were left in a precious state. sancho ran to his ass to get
something wherewith to clean himself, and relieve his master, out of his
alforjas; but not finding them, he well-nigh took leave of his senses,
and cursed himself anew, and in his heart resolved to quit his master and
return home, even though he forfeited the wages of his service and all
hopes of the promised island.

don quixote now rose, and putting his left hand to his mouth to keep his
teeth from falling out altogether, with the other he laid hold of the
bridle of rocinante, who had never stirred from his master's side--so
loyal and well-behaved was he--and betook himself to where the squire
stood leaning over his ass with his hand to his cheek, like one in deep
dejection. seeing him in this mood, looking so sad, don quixote said to
him:

"bear in mind, sancho, that one man is no more than another, unless he

follows that the evil having lasted long, the good must be now nigh at
hand; so thou must not distress thyself at the misfortunes which happen
to me, since thou hast no share in them."

"how have i not?" replied sancho; "was he whom they blanketed yesterday
perchance any other than my father's son? and the alforjas that are
missing to-day with all my treasures, did they belong to any other but
myself?"

"what! are the alforjas missing, sancho?" said don quixote.

"yes, they are missing," answered sancho.

"in that case we have nothing to eat to-day," replied don quixote.

"it would be so," answered sancho, "if there were none of the herbs your
worship says you know in these meadows, those with which knights-errant
as unlucky as your worship are wont to supply such-like shortcomings."

"for all that," answered don quixote, "i would rather have just now a
quarter of bread, or a loaf and a couple of pilchards' heads, than all

they had graduated in the university of paris; whereby we may see that
the lance has never blunted the pen, nor the pen the lance."

"well, be it as your worship says," replied sancho; "let us be off now
and find some place of shelter for the night, and god grant it may be
somewhere where there are no blankets, nor blanketeers, nor phantoms, nor
enchanted moors; for if there are, may the devil take the whole concern."

"ask that of god, my son," said don quixote; "and do thou lead on where
thou wilt, for this time i leave our lodging to thy choice; but reach me
here thy hand, and feel with thy finger, and find out how many of my
teeth and grinders are missing from this right side of the upper jaw, for
it is there i feel the pain."

sancho put in his fingers, and feeling about asked him, "how many
grinders used your worship have on this side?"

"four," replied don quixote, "besides the back-tooth, all whole and quite
sound."

"mind what you

are saying, senor."

"i say four, if not five," answered don quixote, "for never in my life
have i had tooth or grinder drawn, nor has any fallen out or been
destroyed by any decay or rheum."

"well, then," said sancho, "in this lower side your worship has no more
than two grinders and a half, and in the upper neither a half nor any at
all, for it is all as smooth as the palm of my hand."

"luckless that i am!" said don quixote, hearing the sad news his squire
gave him; "i had rather they despoiled me of an arm, so it were not the
sword-arm; for i tell thee, sancho, a mouth without teeth is like a mill
without a millstone, and a tooth is much more to be prized than a
diamond; but we who profess the austere order of chivalry are liable to
all this. mount, friend, and lead the way, and i will follow thee at
whatever pace thou wilt."

sancho did as he bade him, and proceeded in the direction in which he
thought

he might find refuge without quitting the high road, which was
there very much frequented. as they went along, then, at a slow pace--for
the pain in don quixote's jaws kept him uneasy and ill-disposed for
speed--sancho thought it well to amuse and divert him by talk of some
kind, and among the things he said to him was that which will be told in
the following chapter.




chapter xix.

of the shrewd discourse which sancho held with his master, and of the
adventure that befell him with a dead body, together with other notable
occurrences

"it seems to me, senor, that all these mishaps that have befallen us of

made not to eat bread off a tablecloth or embrace the queen, and all the
rest of it that your worship swore to observe until you had taken that
helmet of malandrino's, or whatever the moor is called, for i do not very
well remember."

"thou art very right, sancho," said don quixote, "but to tell the truth,
it had escaped my memory; and likewise thou mayest rely upon it that the
affair of the blanket happened to thee because of thy fault in not
reminding me of it in time; but i will make amends, for there are ways of
compounding for everything in the order of chivalry."

"why! have i taken an oath of some sort, then?" said sancho.

"it makes no matter that thou hast not taken an oath," said don quixote;
"suffice it that i see thou art not quite clear of complicity

 it so happened that the night
closed in somewhat darkly, but for all that they pushed on, sancho
feeling sure that as the road was the king's highway they might
reasonably expect to find some inn within a league or two. going along,
then, in this way, the night dark, the squire hungry, the master
sharp-set, they saw coming towards them on the road they were travelling
a great number of lights which looked exactly like stars in motion.
sancho was taken aback at the sight of them, nor did don quixote
altogether relish them: the one pulled up his ass by the halter, the
other his hack by the bridle, and they stood still, watching anxiously to
see what all this would turn out to be, and found that the lights were
approaching them, and the nearer they came the greater they seemed, at
which spectacle sancho began to shake like a man dosed with mercury, and
don quixote's hair stood on end; he, however, plucking up spirit a
little, said:

"this, no doubt, sancho, will be a most mighty and

 perilous adventure, in
which it will be needful for me to put forth all my valour and
resolution."

"unlucky me!" answered sancho; "if this adventure happens to be one of
phantoms, as i am beginning to think it is, where shall i find the ribs
to bear it?"

"be they phantoms ever so much," said don quixote, "i will not permit
them to touch a thread of thy garments; for if they played tricks with
thee the time before, it was because i was unable to leap the walls of
the yard; but now we are on a wide plain, where i shall be able to wield
my sword as i please."

"and if they enchant and cripple you as they did the last time," said
sancho, "what difference will it make being on the open plain or not?"

"for all that," replied don quixote, "i entreat thee, sancho, to keep a
good heart, for

that behind them there came a litter covered over
with black and followed by six more mounted figures in mourning down to
the very feet of their mules--for they could perceive plainly they were
not horses by the easy pace at which they went. and as the encamisados
came along they muttered to themselves in a low plaintive tone. this
strange spectacle at such an hour and in such a solitary place was quite
enough to strike terror into sancho's heart, and even into his master's;
and (save in don quixote's case) did so, for all sancho's resolution had
now broken down. it was just the opposite with his master, whose
imagination immediately conjured up all this to him vividly as one of the
adventures of his books.

he took it into his head that the litter was a bier on which was borne
some sorely wounded or slain knight, to avenge whom was a task reserved
for him alone; and without any further reasoning he laid his lance in
rest, fixed himself firmly in his saddle, and with gallant spirit

e carry upon that bier,
for, to judge by appearances, either ye have done some wrong or some
wrong has been done to you, and it is fitting and necessary that i should
know, either that i may chastise you for the evil ye have done, or else
that i may avenge you for the injury that has been inflicted upon you."

"we are in haste," answered one of the encamisados, "and the inn is far
off, and we cannot stop to render you such an account as you demand;" and
spurring his mule he moved on.

don quixote was mightily provoked by this answer, and seizing the mule by
the bridle he said, "halt, and be more mannerly, and render an account of
what i have asked of you; else, take my defiance to combat, all of you."

the mule was shy, and was so frightened at her bridle being seized that
rearing up she flung her rider to the ground over her haunches. an
attendant who was on foot, seeing the encamisado fall, began to abuse don
quixote, who now moved to anger, without any more ado, laying his lan

o see, for it seemed just
as if wings had that instant grown upon rocinante, so lightly and proudly
did he bear himself. the encamisados were all timid folk and unarmed, so
they speedily made their escape from the fray and set off at a run across
the plain with their lighted torches, looking exactly like maskers
running on some gala or festival night. the mourners, too, enveloped and
swathed in their skirts and gowns, were unable to bestir themselves, and
so with entire safety to himself don quixote belaboured them all and
drove them off against their will, for they all thought it was no man but
a devil from hell come to carry away the dead body they had in the
litter.

sancho beheld all this in astonishment at the intrepidity of his lord,
and said to himself, "clearly this master of mine is as bold and valiant
as he says he is."

a burning torch lay on the ground near the first man whom the mule had
thrown, by the light of which don quixote perceived him, and coming up to

 him to
yield himself prisoner, or else he would kill him; to which the prostrate
man replied, "i am prisoner enough as it is; i cannot stir, for one of my
legs is broken: i entreat you, if you be a christian gentleman, not to
kill me, which will be committing grave sacrilege, for i am a licentiate
and i hold first orders."

"then what the devil brought you here, being a churchman?" said don
quixote.

"what, senor?" said the other. "my bad luck."

"then still worse awaits you," said don quixote, "if you do not satisfy
me as to all i asked you at first."

"you shall be soon satisfied," said the licentiate; "you must know, then,
that though just now i said i was a licentiate, i am only a bachelor, and
my name is alonzo lopez; i am a native of alcobendas, i come from the
city of baeza with eleven others, priests, the same who fled with the
torches, and we are going to the city of segovia accompanying a dead body
which is in that litter, and is that of a gentleman who died in baez

where he was interred; and now, as i said, we are taking his bones to
their burial-place, which is in segovia, where he was born."

"and who killed him?" asked don quixote.

"god, by means of a malignant fever that took him," answered the
bachelor.

"in that case," said don quixote, "the lord has relieved me of the task
of avenging his death had any other slain him; but, he who slew him
having slain him, there is nothing for it but to be silent, and shrug
one's shoulders; i should do the same were he to slay myself; and i would
have your reverence know that i am a knight of la mancha, don quixote by
name, and it is my business and calling to roam the world righting wrongs
and redressing injuries."

"i do not know how that about righting wrongs can be," said the ba

"for from straight you have made me crooked, leaving me with a broken leg
that will never see itself straight again all the days of its life; and
the injury you have redressed in my case has been to leave me injured in
such a way that i shall remain injured for ever; and the height of
misadventure it was to fall in with you who go in search of adventures."

"things do not all happen in the same way," answered don quixote; "it all
came, sir bachelor alonzo lopez, of your going, as you did, by night,
dressed in those surplices, with lighted torches, praying, covered with
mourning, so that naturally you looked like something evil and of the
other world; and so i could not avoid doing my duty in attacking you, and
i should have attacked you even had i known positively that you were the
very devils of hell, for such i certainly believed and took you to be."

"as my fate has so willed it," said the bachelor,

"i entreat you, sir
knight-errant, whose errand has been such an evil one for me, to help me
to get from under this mule that holds one of my legs caught between the
stirrup and the saddle."

"i would have talked on till to-morrow," said don quixote; "how long were
you going to wait before telling me of your distress?"

he at once called to sancho, who, however, had no mind to come, as he was
just then engaged in unloading a sumpter mule, well laden with provender,
which these worthy gentlemen had brought with them. sancho made a bag of
his coat, and, getting together as much as he could, and as the bag would
hold, he loaded his beast, and then hastened to obey his master's call,
and helped him to remove the bachelor from under the

 mule; then putting
him on her back he gave him the torch, and don quixote bade him follow
the track of his companions, and beg pardon of them on his part for the
wrong which he could not help doing them.

and said sancho, "if by chance these gentlemen should want to know who
was the hero that served them so, your worship may tell them that he is
the famous don quixote of la mancha, otherwise called the knight of the
rueful countenance."

the bachelor then took his departure.

i forgot to mention that before he did so he said to don quixote,
"remember that you stand excommunicated for having laid violent hands on
a holy thing, juxta illud, si quis, suadente diabolo."

"i do not understand that latin," answered don quixote, "but i know well
i did not lay hands, only this pike; besides, i did not think i was
committing an assault upon priests or thin

fared with cid ruy diaz when he broke the chair of the ambassador of that
king before his holiness the pope, who excommunicated him for the same;
and yet the good roderick of vivar bore himself that day like a very
noble and valiant knight."

on hearing this the bachelor took his departure, as has been said,
without making any reply; and don quixote asked sancho what had induced
him to call him the "knight of the rueful countenance" more then than at
any other time.

"i will tell you," answered sancho; "it was because i have been looking
at you for some time by the light of the torch held by that unfortunate,
and verily your worship has got of late the most ill-favoured countenance
i ever saw: it must be either owing to the fatigue of this combat, or
else to the want of teeth and grinders."

"it is not that," replied don quixote,

ney on making that
countenance," said sancho; "for all that need be done is for your worship
to show your own, face to face, to those who look at you, and without
anything more, either image or shield, they will call you 'him of the
rueful countenance' and believe me i am telling you the truth, for i
assure you, senor (and in good part be it said), hunger and the loss of
your grinders have given you such an ill-favoured face that, as i say,
the rueful picture may be very well spared."

don quixote laughed at sancho's pleasantry; nevertheless he resolved to
call himself by that name, and have his shield or buckler painted as he
had devised.

don quixote would have looked to see whether the body in the litter were
bones or not, but sancho would not have it, saying:

"senor, you have ended this perilous adventure more safely for yourself
than any of those i have seen: perhaps these people, though beaten and
routed, may bethink themselves that it is a single man that has beaten

had brought with them on their sumpter mule. but another piece of
ill-luck befell them, which sancho held the worst of all, and that was
that they had no wine to drink, nor even water to moisten their lips; and
as thirst tormented them, sancho, observing that the meadow where they
were was full of green and tender grass, said what will be told in the
following chapter.

of the unexampled and unheard-of adventure which was achieved by the
valiant don quixote of la mancha with less peril than any ever achieved
by any famous knight in the world

"it cannot be, senor, but that this grass is a proof that there must be
hard by some spring or brook to give it moisture, so it would be well to
move a little farther on, that we may find some place where we may quench
this terrible thirst that plagues us, which beyond a doubt is more
distressing than hunger."

the advice seemed good to don quixote, and, he leading rocinante by the
bridle and sancho

rom great rocks, struck their ears. the sound cheered them
greatly; but halting to make out by listening from what quarter it came
they heard unseasonably another noise which spoiled the satisfaction the
sound of the water gave them, especially for sancho, who was by nature
timid and faint-hearted. they heard, i say, strokes falling with a
measured beat, and a certain rattling of iron and chains that, together
with the furious din of the water, would have struck terror into any
heart but don quixote's. the night was, as has been said, dark, and they
had happened to reach a spot in among some tall trees, whose leaves
stirred by a gentle breeze made a low ominous sound; so that, what with
the solitude, the place, the darkness, the noise of the water, and the
rustling of the leaves, everything inspired awe and dread; more
especially as they perceived that the strokes did not cease, nor the wind
lull, nor morning approach; to all which might be added their ignorance

but don quixote, supported by his intrepid heart, leaped on rocinante,
and bracing his buckler on his arm, brought his pike to the slope, and
said, "friend sancho, know that i by heaven's will have been born in this
our iron age to revive in it the age of gold, or the golden as it
is called; i am he for whom perils, mighty achievements, and valiant
deeds are reserved; i am, i say again, he who is to revive the knights of

instead and in lieu of it you mean to desert me now in a place so far
from human reach: for god's sake, master mine, deal not so unjustly by
me, and if your worship will not entirely give up attempting this feat,
at least put it off till morning, for by what the lore i learned when i
was a shepherd tells me it cannot want three hours of dawn now, because
the mouth of the horn is overhead and makes midnight in the line of the
left arm."

"how canst thou see, sancho," said don quixote, "where it makes that
line, or where this mouth or this occiput is that thou talkest of, when
the night is so dark that there is not a star to be seen in the whole
heaven?"

"that's true," said sancho, "but fear has sharp eyes, and sees things
underground, much more above in heavens; besides, there is good reason to
show that it now wants but little of day."

"let it want what it may," replied don quixote, "it shall not be said of
me now or at any time that tears or entreaties turned

what thou hast to do is to tighten
rocinante's girths well, and wait here, for i shall come back shortly,
alive or dead."

sancho perceiving it his master's final resolve, and how little his
tears, counsels, and entreaties prevailed with him, determined to have
recourse to his own ingenuity and compel him, if he could, to wait till
daylight; and so, while tightening the girths of the horse, he quietly
and without being felt, with his ass' halter tied both rocinante's legs,
so that when don quixote strove to go he was unable as the horse could
only move by jumps. seeing the success of his trick, sancho panza said:

"see there, senor! heaven, moved by my tears and prayers, has so ordered
it that rocinante cannot stir; and if you will be obstinate, and spur and
strike him, you will only provoke fortune, and kick, as they say, against
the pricks."

don quixote at this grew desperate, but the more he drove his heels into
the horse, the less he stirred him; and not having any suspicio

thou wilt, for i will act as i think most consistent with my character."

"be not angry, master mine," replied sancho, "i did not mean to say
that;" and coming close to him he laid one hand on the pommel of the
saddle and the other on the cantle so that he held his master's left
thigh in his embrace, not daring to separate a finger's width from him;
so much afraid was he of the strokes which still resounded with a regular
beat. don quixote bade him tell some story to amuse him as he had
proposed, to which sancho replied that he would if his dread of what he
heard would let him; "still," said he, "i will strive to tell a story
which, if i can manage to relate it, and nobody interferes with the
telling, is the best of stories, and let your worship give me your
attention, for here i begin. what was, was; and may the good that is to
come be for all, and the evil for him who goes to look for it--your
worship must know that the

beginning the old folk used to put to their
tales was not just as each one pleased; it was a maxim of cato zonzorino
the roman, that says 'the evil for him that goes to look for it,' and it
comes as pat to the purpose now as ring to finger, to show that your
worship should keep quiet and not go looking for evil in any quarter, and
that we should go back by some other road, since nobody forces us to
follow this in which so many terrors affright us."

"go on with thy story, sancho," said don quixote, "and leave the choice
of our road to my care."

"i say then," continued sancho, "that in a village of estremadura there
was a goat-shepherd--that is to say, one who tended goats--which shepherd
or goatherd, as my story goes, was called lope ruiz, and this lope ruiz
was in love with a shepherdess called torralva, which shepherdess called
torralva was the daughter of a rich grazier, and this rich grazier-"

"if that is the way thou tellest thy tale, sancho," said don quixote,

days; go straight on with it, and tell it like a reasonable man, or else
say nothing."

"tales are always told in my country in the very way i am telling this,"
answered sancho, "and i cannot tell it in any other, nor is it right of
your worship to ask me to make new customs."

"tell it as thou wilt," replied don quixote; "and as fate will have it
that i cannot help listening to thee, go on."

"and so, lord of my soul," continued sancho, as i have said, this
shepherd was in love with torralva the shepherdess, who was a wild buxom
lass with something of the look of a man about her, for she had little
moustaches; i fancy i see her now."

"then you knew her?" said don quixote.

"i did not know her," said sancho, "but he who told me the story said it
was so true and certain that when i told it to another

e reason, according to evil tongues, was some little
jealousy she caused him that crossed the line and trespassed on forbidden
ground; and so much did the shepherd hate her from that time forward
that, in order to escape from her, he determined to quit the country and
go where he should never set eyes on her again. torralva, when she found
herself spurned by lope, was immediately smitten with love for him,
though she had never loved him before."

"that is the natural way of women," said don quixote, "to scorn the one
that loves them, and love the one that hates them: go on, sancho."

"it came to pass," said sancho, "that the shepherd carried out his
intention, and driving his goats before him took his way across the
plains of estremadura to pass over into the kingdom of portugal.
torralva, who knew of it, went after him, and on foot and barefoot
followed him at a distance, with a pilgrim's staff in her hand and a
scrip round her neck, in which she carried, it is said, a bit of

 again brought over
another--let your worship keep count of the goats the fisherman is taking
across, for if one escapes the memory there will be an end of the story,
and it will be impossible to tell another word of it. to proceed, i must
tell you the landing place on the other side was miry and slippery, and
the fisherman lost a great deal of time in going and coming; still he
returned for another goat, and another, and another."

"take it for granted he brought them all across," said don quixote, "and
don't keep going and coming in this way, or thou wilt not make an end of
bringing them over this twelvemonth."

"how many have gone across so far?" said sancho.

"how the devil do i know?" replied don quixote.

"there it is," said sancho, "what i told you, that you must keep a good
count; well then, by god, there is an end of the story, for there is no
going any farther."

"how can that be?" said don quixote; "is it so essential to the story to
know to a nicety the goats that

 have crossed over, that if there be a
mistake of one in the reckoning, thou canst not go on with it?"

"no, senor, not a bit," replied sancho; "for when i asked your worship to
tell me how many goats had crossed, and you answered you did not know, at
that very instant all i had to say passed away out of my memory, and,
faith, there was much virtue in it, and entertainment."

"so, then," said don quixote, "the story has come to an end?"

"as much as my mother has," said sancho.

"in truth," said don quixote, "thou hast told one of the rarest stories,
tales, or histories, that anyone in the world could have imagined, and
such a way of telling it and ending it was never seen nor will be in a
lifetime; though i expected nothing else from thy excellent
understanding. but i do not wonder, for perhaps those ceaseless strokes
may have confused thy wits."

"all that may be," replied sancho, 
 
 ___________________________
 
"but i know that as to my story, all
that can be said is that it ends there where the mistake in the count of
the passage of the goats begins."

"let it end where it will, well and good," said don quixote, "and let us
see if rocinante can go;" and again he spurred him, and again rocinante
made jumps and remained where he was, so well tied was he.

just then, whether it was the cold of the morning that was now
approaching, or that he had eaten something laxative at supper, or that
it was only natural (as is most likely), sancho felt a desire to do what
no one could do for him; but so great was the fear that had penetrated
his heart, he dared not separate himself from his master by as much

 this accomplished, which he fancied was all he had to do to
get out of this terrible strait and embarrassment, another still greater
difficulty presented itself, for it seemed to him impossible to relieve
himself without making some noise, and he ground his teeth and squeezed
his shoulders together, holding his breath as much as he could; but in
spite of his precautions he was unlucky enough after all to make a little
noise, very different from that which was causing him so much fear.

don quixote, hearing it, said, "what noise is that, sancho?"

"i don't know, senor," said he; "it must be something new, for adventures
and misadventures never begin with a trifle." once more he tried his
luck, and succeeded so well, that without any further noise or
disturbance he found himself relieved of the burden that had given him so
much discomfort. but as don quixote's sense of smell was as acute as his
hearing, and as sancho was so closely linked with him that the fumes rose
almost in a st

raight line, it could not be but that some should reach his
nose, and as soon as they did he came to its relief by compressing it
between his fingers, saying in a rather snuffing tone, "sancho, it
strikes me thou art in great fear."

"i am," answered sancho; "but how does your worship perceive it now more
than ever?"

"because just now thou smellest stronger than ever, and not of
ambergris," answered don quixote.

"very likely," said sancho, "but that's not my fault, but your worship's,
for leading me about at unseasonable hours and at such unwonted paces."

"then go back three or four, my friend," said don quixote, all the time
with his fingers to his nose; "and for the future pay more attention to
thy person and to what thou owest to mine; for it is my great familiarity
with thee that has bred this contempt."

"i'll bet," replied sancho, "that your worship thinks i have done
something i ou

ght not with my person."

"it makes it worse to stir it, friend sancho," returned don quixote.

with this and other talk of the same sort master and man passed the
night, till sancho, perceiving that daybreak was coming on apace, very
cautiously untied rocinante and tied up his breeches. as soon as
rocinante found himself free, though by nature he was not at all
mettlesome, he seemed to feel lively and began pawing--for as to
capering, begging his pardon, he knew not what it meant. don quixote,
then, observing that rocinante could move, took it as a good sign and a
signal that he should attempt the dread adventure. by this time day had
fully broken and everything showed distinctly, and don quixote saw that
he was among some tall trees, chestnuts, which cast a very deep shade; he
perceived likewise that the sound of the strokes did not cease, but could
not discover what caused it, and so without any further delay he let
rocinante feel the spur, and once more taking leave of san

n prosperity or adversity; and advancing
some distance through the shady chestnut trees they came upon a little
meadow at the foot of some high rocks, down which a mighty rush of water
flung itself. at the foot of the rocks were some rudely constructed
houses looking more like ruins than houses, from among which came, they
perceived, the din and clatter of blows, which still continued without
intermission. rocinante took fright at the noise of the water and of the
blows, but quieting him don quixote advanced step by step towards the
houses, commending himself with all his heart to his lady, imploring her
support in that dread pass and enterprise, and on the way commending
himself to god, too, not to forget him. sancho who never quitted his
side, stretched his neck as far as he could and peered between the legs
of rocinante to see if he could now discover what it was that caused him
such fear and apprehension. they went it might be a hundred paces
farther, when on turning a corner th

e true cause, beyond the possibility
of any mistake, of that dread-sounding and to them awe-inspiring noise
that had kept them all the night in such fear and perplexity, appeared
plain and obvious; and it was (if, reader, thou art not disgusted and
disappointed) six fulling hammers which by their alternate strokes made
all the din.

when don quixote perceived what it was, he was struck dumb and rigid from
head to foot. sancho glanced at him and saw him with his head bent down
upon his breast in manifest mortification; and don quixote glanced at
sancho and saw him with his cheeks puffed out and his mouth full of
laughter, and evidently ready to explode with it, and in spite of his
vexation he could not help laughing at the sight of him; and when sancho
saw his master begin he let go so heartily that he had to hold his sides
with both
 
 ___________________________
 
 hands to keep himself from bursting with laughter. four times
he stopped, and as many times did his laughter break out afresh with the
same violence as at first, whereat don quixote grew furious, above all
when he heard him say mockingly, "thou must know, friend sancho, that of
heaven's will i was born in this our iron age to revive in it the golden
or age of gold; i am he for whom are reserved perils, mighty
achievements, valiant deeds;" and here he went on repeating the words
that don quixote uttered the first time they heard the awful strokes.

don quixote, then, seeing that sancho was turning him into ridicule, was
so mortified and vexed that he lifted up his pike and smote him two such
blows that if, instead of catching them on his shoulders, he had caught
them on his head there would have been no wages to pay, unless indeed to
his heirs. sancho seeing that he was getting an awkward return in earnest
for his jest, and fearing his master might carry it still further, said

to him very humbly, "calm yourself, sir, for by god i am only joking."

"well, then, if you are joking i am not," replied don quixote. "look
here, my lively gentleman, if these, instead of being fulling hammers,
had been some perilous adventure, have i not, think you, shown the
courage required for the attempt and achievement? am i, perchance, being,
as i am, a gentleman, bound to know and distinguish sounds and tell
whether they come from fulling mills or not; and that, when perhaps, as
is the case, i have never in my life seen any as you have, low boor as
you are, that have been born and bred among them? but turn me

with the joke. but tell me, your worship, now that peace is made between
us (and may god bring you out of all the adventures that may befall you
as safe and sound as he has brought you out of this one), was it not a
thing to laugh at, and is it not a good story, the great fear we were
in?--at least that i was in; for as to your worship i see now that you
neither know nor understand what either fear or dismay is."

"i do not deny," said don quixote, "that what happened to us may be worth
laughing at, but it is not worth making a story about, for it is not
everyone that is shrewd enough to hit the right point of a thing."

"at any rate," said sancho, "your worship knew how to hit the right point
with your pike, aiming at my head and hitting me on the shoulders, thanks
be to god and my own smartness in dodging it. but let that pass; all will
come out in the scouring; for i have heard say 'he loves thee well that

any hard words they give a servant to give him a pair of breeches; though
i do not know what they give after blows, unless it be that
knights-errant after blows give islands, or kingdoms on the mainland."

"it may be on the dice," said don quixote, "that all thou sayest will
come true; overlook the past, for thou art shrewd enough to know that our
first movements are not in our own control; and one thing for the future
bear in mind, that thou curb and restrain thy loquacity in my company;
for in all the books of chivalry that i have read, and they are
innumerable, i never met with a squire who talked so much to his lord as
thou dost to thine; and in fact i feel it to be a great fault of thine
and of mine: of thine, that thou hast

ours and
benefits that i have promised you will come in due time, and if they do
not your wages at least will not be lost, as i have already told you."

"all that your worship says is very well," said sancho, "but i should
like to know (in case the time of favours should not come, and it might
be necessary to fall back upon wages) how much did the squire of a
knight-errant get in those days, and did they agree by the month, or by
the day like bricklayers?"

"i do not believe," replied don quixote, "that such squires were ever on
wages, but were dependent on favour; and if i have now mentioned thine in
the sealed will i have left at home, it was with a view to what may
happen; for as yet i know not how chivalry will turn out in these
wretched times of ours, and i do not wish my soul to suffer for trifles
in the other world; for i would have thee know, sancho, that in this
there is no condition more hazardous than that of adventurers."

"that is true," said sancho, "since the mere

 noise of the hammers of a
fulling mill can disturb and disquiet the heart of such a valiant errant
adventurer as your worship; but you may be sure i will not open my lips
henceforward to make light of anything of your worship's, but only to
honour you as my master and natural lord."

the earth; for next to parents, masters are to be respected as though
they were parents."

aside to right they came upon another road, different from that which
they had taken the night before. shortly afterwards don quixote perceived
a man on horseback who wore on his head something that shone like gold,
and the moment he saw him he turned to sancho and said:

"i think, sancho, there is no proverb that is not true, all being maxims
drawn from experience itself, the mother of all the sciences, especially
that one that says, 'where one door shuts, another opens.' i say so
because if last night fortune shut the door of the adventure we were
looking for against us, cheating us with the fulling mills, it now op

to my ignorance of fulling mills, or the darkness of the night. i say
this because, if i mistake not, there comes towards us one who wears on
his head the helmet of mambrino, concerning which i took the oath thou
rememberest."

"mind what you say, your worship, and still more what you do," said
sancho, "for i don't want any more fulling mills to finish off fulling
and knocking our senses out."

"the devil take thee, man," said don quixote; "what has a helmet to do
with fulling mills?"

"i don't know," replied sancho, "but, faith, if i might speak as i used,
perhaps i could give such reasons that your worship would see you were
mistaken in what you say."

"how can i be mistaken in what i say, unbelieving traitor?" returned don
quixote; "tell me, seest thou not yonder knight coming towards us on a
dappled grey steed, who has upon his head a helmet of gold?"

"what i see and make out," answered sancho, "is only a man on

a grey ass
like my own, who has something that shines on his head."

"well, that is the helmet of mambrino," said don quixote; "stand to one
side and leave me alone with him; thou shalt see how, without saying a
word, to save time, i shall bring this adventure to an issue and possess
myself of the helmet i have so longed for."

"i will take care to stand aside," said sancho; "but god grant, i say
once more, that it may be marjoram and not fulling mills."

"i have told thee, brother, on no account to mention those fulling mills
to me again," said don quixote, "or i vow--and i say no more-i'll full

ber of the larger served
the smaller, and in it there was a sick man who required to be bled and
another man who wanted to be shaved, and on this errand the barber was
going, carrying with him a brass basin; but as luck would have it, as he
was on the way it began to rain, and not to spoil his hat, which probably
was a new one, he put the basin on his head, and being clean it glittered
at half a league's distance. he rode upon a grey ass, as sancho said, and
this was what made it seem to don quixote to be a dapple-grey steed and a
knight and a golden helmet; for everything he saw he made to fall in with
his crazy chivalry and ill-errant notions; and when he saw the poor
knight draw near, without entering into any parley with him, at
rocinante's top speed he bore down upon him with the pike pointed low,
fully determined to run him through and through, and as he reached him,
without checking the fury of his charge, he cried to him:

"defend thyself, miserable being, or yield me of th
 
 ___________________________
 
ine own accord that
which is so reasonably my due."

the barber, who without any expectation or apprehension of it saw this
apparition coming down upon him, had no other way of saving himself from
the stroke of the lance but to let himself fall off his ass; and no
sooner had he touched the ground than he sprang up more nimbly than a
deer and sped away across the plain faster than the wind.

he left the basin on the ground, with which don quixote contented
himself, saying that the pagan had shown his discretion and imitated the
beaver, which finding itself pressed by the hunters bites and cuts off
with its teeth that for which, by its natural instinct, it knows it is
pursued.

he told sancho to pick up the helmet, and he taking it in his hands said:

"by god the basin is a good one, and worth a real of eight if it is worth
a maravedis," and handed it to his master, who immediately put it on his
head, turning it round, now this

 way, now that, in search of fitment, and
not finding it he said, "clearly the pagan to whose measure this famous
head-piece was first forged must have had a very large head; but the
worst of it is half of it is wanting."

when sancho heard him call the basin a headpiece he was unable to
restrain his laughter, but remembering his master's wrath he checked
himself in the midst of it.

"what art thou laughing at, sancho?" said don quixote.

"i am laughing," said he, "to think of the great head the pagan must have
had who owned this helmet, for it looks exactly like a regular barber's
basin."

"dost thou know what i suspect, sancho?" said don quixote; "that this
wonderful piece of this enchanted helmet must by some strange accident
have come into the hands of some one who was unable to recognise or
realise its value, and who, not knowing what he did, and seeing it to be
of the purest gold, must have melted down one half

 even come up to it; and in the meantime i will wear it as
well as i can, for something is better than nothing; all the more as it
will be quite enough to protect me from any chance blow of a stone."

"that is," said sancho, "if it is not shot with a sling as they were in
the battle of the two armies, when they signed the cross on your
worship's grinders and smashed the flask with that blessed draught that
made me vomit my bowels up."

"it does not grieve me much to have lost it," said don quixote, "for thou
knowest, sancho, that i have the receipt in my memory."

"so have i," answered sancho, "but if ever i make it, or try it again as
long as i live, may this be my last hour; moreover, i have no intention
of putting myself in the way of wanting it, for i mean, with all my five
senses, to keep myself from being wounded or from wounding anyone: as to
being blanketed again i say nothing, for it is hard to prevent mishaps of
that sort, and if they come there is nothing for it but to

shoulders together, hold our breath, shut our eyes, and let ourselves go
where luck and the blanket may send us."

"thou art a bad christian, sancho," said don quixote on hearing this,
"for once an injury has been done thee thou never forgettest it: but know
that it is the part of noble and generous hearts not to attach importance
to trifles. what lame leg hast thou got by it, what broken rib, what
cracked head, that thou canst not forget that jest? for jest and sport it
was, properly regarded, and had i not seen it in that light i would have
returned and done more mischief in revenging thee than the greeks did for
the rape of helen, who, if she were a

 sort of jest and earnest it was, and i know it will never be
rubbed out of my memory any more than off my shoulders. but putting that
aside, will your worship tell me what are we to do with this dapple-grey
steed that looks like a grey ass, which that martino that your worship
overthrew has left deserted here? for, from the way he took to his heels
and bolted, he is not likely ever to come back for it; and by my beard
but the grey is a good one."

"i have never been in the habit," said don quixote, "of taking spoil of
those whom i vanquish, nor is it the practice of chivalry to take away
their horses and leave them to go on foot, unless indeed it be that the
victor have lost his own in the combat, in which case it is lawful to
take that of the vanquished as a thing won in lawful war; therefore,
sancho, leave this horse, or ass, or whatever thou wilt have it to be;
for when its owner sees us gone hence he will come back for it."

"god knows i should like to take it," returned sanc

ho, "or at least to
change it for my own, which does not seem to me as good a one: verily the
laws of chivalry are strict, since they cannot be stretched to let one
ass be changed for another; i should like to know if i might at least
change trappings."

"on that head i am not quite certain," answered don quixote, "and the
matter being doubtful, pending better information, i say thou mayest
change them, if so be thou hast urgent need of them."

"so urgent is it," answered sancho, "that if they were for my own person
i could not want them more;" and forthwith, fortified by this licence, he
effected the mutatio capparum, rigging out his beast to the ninety-nines
and making quite another thing of it. this done, they broke their fast on
the remains of the spoils of war plundered from the sumpter mul

lowed him wherever he led, lovingly and sociably;
nevertheless they returned to the high road, and pursued it at a venture
without any other aim.

as they went along, then, in this way sancho said to his master, "senor,
would your worship give me leave to speak a little to you? for since you
laid that hard injunction of silence on me several things have gone to
rot in my stomach, and i have now just one on the tip of my tongue that i
don't want to be spoiled."

"say, on, sancho," said don quixote, "and be brief in thy discourse, for
there is no pleasure in one that is long."

"well then, senor," returned sancho, "i say that for some days past i
have been considering how little is got or gained by going in search of
these adventures that your worship seeks in these wilds and cross-roads,
where, even if the most perilous are victoriously achieved, there is no
one to see or know of them, and so they must be left untold for ever, to
the loss of your worship's object and the credit t

g which the lord in whose service we may be will perforce have

go beyond squirely limits, though i make bold to say that, if it be the
practice in chivalry to write the achievements of squires, i think mine
must not be left out."

"thou speakest not amiss, sancho," answered don quixote, "but before that
point is reached it is requisite to roam the world, as it were on
probation, seeking adventures, in order that, by achieving some, name and
fame may be acquired, such that when he betakes himself to the court of
some great monarch the knight may be already known by his deeds, and that
the boys, the instant they see him enter the gate of the city, may all
follow him and surround him, crying, 'this is the knight of the sun'-or

to so exalted a rank. he marries his squire to a damsel of the
princess's, who will be, no doubt, the one who was confidante in their
amour, and is daughter of a very great duke."

"that's what i want, and no mistake about it!" said sancho. "that's what
i'm waiting for; for all this, word for word, is in store for your
worship under the title of the knight of the rueful countenance."

"thou needst not doubt it, sancho," replied don quixote, "for in the same
manner, and by the same steps as i have described here, knights-errant
rise and have risen to be kings and emperors; all we want now is to find
out what king, christian or pagan, is at war and has a beautiful
daughter; but there will be time enough to think of that, for, as i have
told thee, fame must be won in other quarters before repairing to the
court. there is another thing, too, that is wanting; for supposing we
find a king who is at war and has a beautiful daught

ur worship says, to seize her and transport her. but the
mischief is that until peace is made and you come into the peaceful
enjoyment of your kingdom, the poor squire is famishing as far as rewards
go, unless it be that the confidante damsel that is to be his wife comes
with the princess, and that with her he tides over his bad luck until
heaven otherwise orders things; for his master, i suppose, may as well
give her to him at once for a lawful wife."

"nobody can object to that," said don quixote.

"then since that may be," said sancho, "there is nothing for it but to
commend ourselves to god, and let fortune take what course it will."

"god guide it according to my wishes and thy wants," said don quixote,
"and mean be he who thinks himself mean."

"in god's name let him be so," said sancho: "i am an old christian, and
to fit me for a count that's enough."

"and more than enough for thee," said don quixote; "and even wert thou
not, it would make no difference, because i bein

"title thou shouldst say, not tittle," said his master.

"so be it," answered sancho. "i say i will know how to behave, for once
in my life i was beadle of a brotherhood, and the beadle's gown sat so
well on me that all said i looked as if i was to be steward of the same
brotherhood. what will it be, then, when i put a duke's robe on my back,
or dress myself in gold and pearls like a count? i believe they'll come a
hundred leagues to see me."

"thou wilt look well," said don quixote, "but thou must shave thy beard
often, for thou hast it so thick and rough and unkempt, that if thou dost
not shave it every second day at least, they will see what thou art at
the distance of a musket shot."

"what more will it be," said sancho, "than having a barber, and keeping
him at wages in the house? and even if it be necessary, i will make him
go behind me like a nobleman's equerry."

"why, how dost thou know that noblemen have equerries behind them?" asked
don quixote.

"i

or a month at the
capital and there i saw taking the air a very small gentleman who they
said was a very great man, and a man following him on horseback in every
turn he took, just as if he was his tail. i asked why this man did not
join the other man, instead of always going behind him; they answered me
that he was his equerry, and that it was the custom with nobles to have
such persons behind them, and ever since then i know it, for i have never
forgotten it."

"thou art right," said don quixote, "and in the same way thou mayest
carry thy barber with thee, for customs did not come into use all
together, nor were they all invented at once, and thou mayest be the
first count to have a barber to follow him; and, indeed, shaving one's
beard is a greater trust than saddling one's horse."

"let the barber business be my look-out," said sancho; "and your
worship's be it to strive to become a king, and make me a count."

"so it shall be," answered don quixote, and raising his eyes he

of the freedom don quixote conferred on several unfortunates who against

cide hamete benengeli, the arab and manchegan author, relates in this
most grave, high-sounding, minute, delightful, and original history that
after the discussion between the famous don quixote of la mancha and his
squire sancho panza which is set down at the end of chapter twenty-one,
don quixote raised his eyes and saw coming along the road he was
following some dozen men on foot strung together by the neck, like beads,
on a great iron chain, and all with manacles on their hands. with them
there came also two men on horseback and two on foot; those on horseback
with wheel-lock muskets, those on foot with javelins and swords, and as
soon as sancho saw them he said:

"that is
 
 ___________________________
 
 a chain of galley slaves, on the way to the galleys by force of
the king's orders."

"how by force?" asked don quixote; "is it possible that the king uses
force against anyone?"

"i do not say that," answered sancho, "but that these are people
condemned for their crimes to serve by force in the king's galleys."

"in fact," replied don quixote, "however it may be, these people are
going where they are taking them by force, and not of their own will."

"just so," said sancho.

"then if so," said don quixote, "here is a case for the exercise of my
office, to put down force and to succour and help the wretched."

"recollect, your worship," said sancho, "justice, which is the king
himself, is not using force or doing wrong to such persons, but punishing
them for their crimes."

the chain of galley slaves had by this time come

 up, and don quixote in
very courteous language asked those who were in custody of it to be good
enough to tell him the reason or reasons for which they were conducting
these people in this manner. one of the guards on horseback answered that
they were galley slaves belonging to his majesty, that they were going to
the galleys, and that was all that was to be said and all he had any
business to know.

"nevertheless," replied don quixote, "i should like to know from each of
them separately the reason of his misfortune;" to this he added more to
the same effect to induce them to tell him what he wanted so civilly that
the other mounted guard said to him:

"though we have here the register and certificate of the sentence of
every one of these wretches, this is no time to take them out or read
them; come and ask themselves; they can tell if they choose, and they
will, for these fellows take a pleasure in doing and talking

about
rascalities."

with this permission, which don quixote would have taken even had they
not granted it, he approached the chain and asked the first for what
offences he was now in such a sorry case.

he made answer that it was for being a lover.

"for that only?" replied don quixote; "why, if for being lovers they send
people to the galleys i might have been rowing in them long ago."

"the love is not the sort your worship is thinking of," said the galley
slave; "mine was that i loved a washerwoman's basket of clean linen so
well, and held it so close in my embrace, that if the arm of the law had
not forced it from me, i should never have let it go of my own will to
this moment; i was caught in the act, there was no occasion for torture,
the case was settled, they

treated me to a hundred lashes on the back,
and three years of gurapas besides, and that was the end of it."

"what are gurapas?" asked don quixote.

"gurapas are galleys," answered the galley slave, who was a young man of
about four-and-twenty, and said he was a native of piedrahita.

don quixote asked the same question of the second, who made no reply, so
downcast and melancholy was he; but the first answered for him, and said,
"he, sir, goes as a canary, i mean as a musician and a singer."

"what!" said don quixote, "for being musicians and singers are people
sent to the galleys too?"

"yes, sir," answered the galley slave, "for there is nothing worse than
singing under suffering."

"on the contrary, i have heard say," said don quixote, "that he who sings
scares away his wo

es."

"here it is the reverse," said the galley slave; "for he who sings once
weeps all his life."

"i do not understand it," said don quixote; but one of the guards said to
him, "sir, to sing under suffering means with the non sancta fraternity
to confess under torture; they put this sinner to the torture and he
confessed his crime, which was being a cuatrero, that is a
cattle-stealer, and on his confession they sentenced him to six years in
the galleys, besides two bundred lashes that he has already had on the
back; and he is always dejected and downcast because the other thieves
that were left behind and that march here ill-

treat, and snub, and jeer,
and despise him for confessing and not having spirit enough to say nay;
for, say they, 'nay' has no more letters in it than 'yea,' and a culprit
is well off when life or death with him depends on his own tongue and not
on that of witnesses or evidence; and to my thinking they are not very
far out."

"and i think so too," answered don quixote; then passing on to the third
he asked him what he had asked the others, and the man answered very
readily and unconcernedly, "i am going for five years to their ladyships
the gurapas for the want of ten ducats."

"i will give twenty with pleasure to get you out of that trouble," said
don quixote.

"that," said the galley slave, "is like a man having money at sea when he
is dying of hunger and has no way of buying what he wants; i say so
because if at the right time i had had those tw

enty ducats that your
worship now offers me, i would have greased the notary's pen and
freshened up the attorney's wit with them, so that to-day i should be in
the middle of the plaza of the zocodover at toledo, and not on this road
coupled like a greyhound. but god is great; patience--there, that's
enough of it."

don quixote passed on to the fourth, a man of venerable aspect with a
white beard falling below his breast, who on hearing himself asked the
reason of his being there began to weep without answering a word, but the
fifth acted as his tongue and said, "this worthy man is going to the
galleys for four years, after having gone the rounds in ceremony and on
horseback."

"that means," said sancho panza, "as i take it, to have been exposed to
shame in public."

"just so," replied the galley slave, "and

 the offence for which they gave
him that punishment was having been an ear-broker, nay body-broker; i
mean, in short, that this gentleman goes as a pimp, and for having
besides a certain touch of the sorcerer about him."

"if that touch had not been thrown in," said don quixote, "he would not
deserve, for mere pimping, to row in the galleys, but rather to command
and be admiral of them; for the office of pimp is no ordinary one, being
the office of persons of discretion, one very necessary in a well-ordered
state, and only to be exercised by persons of good birth; nay, there
ought to be an inspector and overseer of them, as in other offices, and
recognised number, as with the brokers on change; in this way many of the
evils would be avoided which are caused by

ny harm by it, for my
only object was that all the world should enjoy itself and live in peace
and quiet, without quarrels or troubles; but my good intentions were
unavailing to save me from going where i never expect to come back from,
with this weight of years upon me and a urinary ailment that never gives
me a moment's ease;" and again he fell to weeping as before, and such
compassion did sancho feel for him that he took out a real of four from
his bosom and gave it to him in alms.

don quixote went on and asked another what his crime was, and the man
answered with no less but rather much more sprightliness than the last
one.

"i am here because i carried the joke too far with a couple of cousins of
mine, and with a couple of other cousins who were none of mine; in short,
i carried the joke so far with them all that it ended in such a
complicated increase of kindred that no accountant could make it clear:
it was all proved against me, i got no favour, i had no money, i was nea

turned in a little one towards the
other. he was bound differently from the rest, for he had to his leg a
chain so long that it was wound all round his body, and two rings on his
neck, one attached to the chain, the other to what they call a
"keep-friend" or "friend's foot," from which hung two irons reaching to
his waist with two manacles fixed to them in which his hands were secured
by a big padlock, so that he could neither raise his hands to his mouth
nor lower his head to his hands. don quixote asked why this man carried
so many more chains than the others. the guard replied that it was
because he alone had committed more crimes than all the rest put
together, and was so daring and such a villain, that though they marched
him in that fashion they did not feel sure of him, but were in dread of
his making his escape.

"what crimes can he have committed," said don quixote, "if they have not
deserved a heavier punishment than being sent to the galleys?"

"he goes for ten years,"

are becoming tiresome with all this inquisitiveness about the lives of
others; if you want to know about mine, let me tell you i am gines de

"he says true," said the commissary, "for he has himself written his
story as grand as you please, and has left the book in the prison in pawn
for two hundred reals."

"and i mean to take it out of pawn," said gines, "though it were in for
two hundred ducats."

"is it so good?" said don quixote.

"so good is it," replied gines, "that a fig for 'lazarillo de tormes,'
and all of that kind that have been written, or shall be written compared
with it: all i will say about it is that it deals with facts, and facts
so neat and diverting that no lies could match them."

"and how is the book entitled?" asked don quixote.

"the 'life of gines de pasamonte,'" replied the subject of it.

"and is it finished?" asked don quixote.

"how can it be finished," said the other, "when my lif

finished? all that is written is from my birth down to the point when
they sent me to the galleys this last time."

"then you have been there before?" said don quixote.

"in the service of god and the king i have been there for four years
before now, and i know by this time what the biscuit and courbash are
like," replied gines; "and it is no great grievance to me to go back to
them, for there i shall have time to finish my book; i have still many
things left to say, and in the galleys of spain there is more than enough
leisure; though i do not want much for what i have to write, for i have
it by heart."

asamonte;
"their lordships yonder never gave you that staff to ill-treat us
wretches here, but to conduct and take us where his majesty orders you;
if not, by the life of-never mind-; it may be that some day the stains
made in the inn will come out in the scouring; let everyone hold his
tongue and behave well and speak better; and now let us march on, for we
have had quite enough of this entertainment."

the commissary lifted his staff to strike pasamonte in return for his
threats, but don quixote came between them, and begged him not to ill-use
him, as it was not too much to allow one who had his hands tied to have
his tongue a trifle free; and turning to the whole chain of them he said:

"from all you have told me, dear brethren, make out clearly that though
they have punished you for your faults, the punishments you are about to
endure do not give you much pleasure, and that you go to them very much
against the grain and against your will, and that perhaps this one's want

 to give aid to those in need and under the oppression of the
strong. but as i know that it is a mark of prudence not to do by foul
means what may be done by fair, i will ask these gentlemen, the guards
and commissary, to be so good as to release you and let you go in peace,
as there will be no lack of others to serve the king under more
favourable circumstances; for it seems to me a hard case to make slaves
of those whom god and nature have made free. moreover, sirs of the
guard," added don quixote, "these poor fellows have done nothing to you;
let each answer for his own sins yonder; there is a god in heaven who
will not forget to punish the wicked or reward the good; and it is not
fitting that honest men should be the instruments of punishment to
others, they being therein no way concerned. this request i make thus
gently and quietly, that, if you comply with it, i may have reason for
thanking you; and, if you will not voluntarily, this lance and sword
together with the might of

my arm shall compel you to comply with it by
force."

"nice nonsense!" said the commissary; "a fine piece of pleasantry he has
come out with at last! he wants us to let the king's prisoners go, as if
we had any authority to release them, or he to order us to do so! go your
way, sir, and good luck to you; put that basin straight that you've got
on your head, and don't go looking for three feet on a cat."

"'tis you that are the cat, rat, and rascal," replied don quixote, and
acting on the word he fell upon him so suddenly that without giving him
time to defend himself he brought him to the ground sorely wounded with a
lance-thrust; and lucky it was for him that it was the one that had the
musket. the other guards stood thunderstruck and amazed at this

would have gone badly with him if the galley slaves, seeing the chance
before them of liberating themselves, had not effected it by contriving
to break the chain on which they were strung. such was the confusion,
that the guards, now rushing at the galley slaves who were breaking
loose, now to attack don quixote who was waiting for them, did nothing at
all that was of any use. sancho, on his part, gave a helping hand to
release gines de pasamonte, who was the first to leap forth upon the
plain free and unfettered, and who, attacking the prostrate commissary,
took from him his sword and the musket, with which, aiming at one and
levelling at another, he, without ever discharging it, drove every one of
the guards off the field, for they took to flight, as well to escape
pasamonte's musket, as the s

howers of stones the now released galley
slaves were raining upon them. sancho was greatly grieved at the affair,
because he anticipated that those who had fled would report the matter to
the holy brotherhood, who at the summons of the alarm-bell would at once
sally forth in quest of the offenders; and he said so to his master, and
entreated him to leave the place at once, and go into hiding in the
sierra that was close by.

"that is all very well," said don quixote, "but i know what must be done
now;" and calling together all the galley slaves, who were now running
riot, and had stripped the commissary to the skin, he collected them
round him to hear what he had to say, and addressed them as follows: "to
be grateful for benefits received is the part of persons of good birth,
and one of the sins most offensive to god is ingratitude; i say so
because, sirs, ye have already seen by manifest proof the benefit ye have
received of me; in return for which

we will say for your worship's intention, and this is a condition that
can be complied with by night as by day, running or resting, in peace or
in war; but to imagine that we are going now to return to the flesh-pots
of egypt, i mean to take up our chain and set out for el toboso, is to
imagine that it is now night, though it is not yet ten in the morning,
and to ask this of us is like asking pears of the elm tree."

"then by all that's good," said don quixote (now stirred to wrath), "don
son of a bitch, don ginesillo de paropillo, or whatever your name is, you
will have to go yourself alone, with your tail between your legs and the
whole chain on your back."

pasamonte, who was anything but meek (being by this time thoroughly
convinced that don quixote was not quite right in his head as he had
committed such a vagary as to set them free), finding himself abused in
this fashion, gave the wink to his companions, and falling back they

 shower stones on don quixote at such a rate that he was quite
unable to protect himself with his buckler, and poor rocinante no more
heeded the spur than if he had been made of brass. sancho planted himself
behind his ass, and with him sheltered himself from the hailstorm that
poured on both of them. don quixote was unable to shield himself so well
but that more pebbles than i could count struck him full on the body with
such force that they brought him to the ground; and the instant he fell
the student pounced upon him, snatched the basin from his head, and with
it struck three or four blows on his shoulders, and as many more on the
ground, knocking it almost to pieces. they then stripped him of a jacket

stockings if his greaves

 had not prevented them. from sancho they took
his coat, leaving him in his shirt-sleeves; and dividing among themselves
the remaining spoils of the battle, they went each one his own way, more
solicitous about keeping clear of the holy brotherhood they dreaded, than
about burdening themselves with the chain, or going to present themselves
before the lady dulcinea del toboso. the ass and rocinante, sancho and
don quixote, were all that were left upon the spot; the ass with drooping
head, serious, shaking his ears from time to time as if he thought the
storm of stones that assailed them was not yet over; rocinante stretched
beside his master, for he too had been brought to the ground by a stone;
sancho stripped, and trembling with fear of the holy brotherhood; and don
quixote fuming to find himself so served by the very persons for whom he
had done so much.

seeing himself served in this way, don quixote said to his squire, "i
have always heard it said, sancho, that to do good to boors is to throw
water into the sea. if i had believed thy words, i should have avoided
this trouble; but it is done now, it is only to have patience and take
warning for the future."

"your worship will take warning as much as i am a turk," returned sancho;
"but, as you say this mischief might have been avoided if you had
believed me, believe me now, and a still greater one will be avoided; for

"thou art a coward by nature, sancho," said don quixote, "but lest thou
shouldst say i am obstinate, and that i never do as thou dost advise,
this once i will take thy advice, and withdraw out of reach of that fury
thou so dreadest; but it must be on one condition, that never, in life or
in death, thou art to say to anyone that i retired or withdrew from this
danger out of fear, but only in compliance with thy entreaties; for if
thou sayest otherwise thou wilt lie therein, and from this time to that,
and from that to this, i give thee lie, an

notion of what they call safe conduct; so repent not of having taken my
advice, but mount rocinante if you can, and if not i will help you; and
follow me, for my mother-wit tells me we have more need of legs than

don quixote mounted without replying, and, sancho leading the way on his
ass, they entered the side of the sierra morena, which was close by, as
it was sancho's design to cross it entirely and come out again at el viso
or almodovar del campo, and hide for some days among its crags so as to
escape the search of the brotherhood should they come to look for them.
he was encouraged in this by perceiving that the stock of provisions
carried by the ass had come safe out of the fray with the galley slaves,

seemed prudent to sancho to pass the night and even some days, at least
as many as the stores he carried might last, and so they encamped between
two rocks and among some cork trees; but fatal destiny, which, according
to the opinion of those who have not the light of the true faith,
directs, arranges, and settles everything in its own way, so ordered it
that gines de pasamonte, the famous knave and thief who by the virtue and
madness of don quixote had been released from the chain, driven by fear
of the holy brotherhood, which he had good reason to dread, resolved to
take hiding in the mountains; and his fate and fear led him to the same
spot to which don quixote and sancho panza had been led by theirs, just
in time to recognise them and leave them to fall asleep: and as the
wicked are always ungrateful, and necessity leads to evildoing, and
immediate advantage overcomes all considerations of the future, gines,

eful nor well-principled, made up his mind to steal
sancho panza's ass, not troubling himself about rocinante, as being a
prize that was no good either to pledge or sell. while sancho slept he
stole his ass, and before day dawned he was far out of reach.

aurora made her appearance bringing gladness to the earth but sadness to
sancho panza, for he found that his dapple was missing, and seeing
himself bereft of him he began the saddest and most doleful lament in the
world, so loud that don quixote awoke at his exclamations and heard him
saying, "o son of my bowels, born in my very house, my children's
plaything, my wife's joy, the envy of my neighbours, relief of my
burdens, and lastly, half supporter of myself, for with the
six-and-twenty maravedis thou didst earn me daily i met half my charges."

don quixote, when he heard the lament and learned the cause, consoled
sancho with the best arguments he could, entreating him to be patient,
and promising to give him a letter of excha

nge ordering three out of five
ass-colts that he had at home to be given to him. sancho took comfort at
this, dried his tears, suppressed his sobs, and returned thanks for the
kindness shown him by don quixote. he on his part was rejoiced to the
heart on entering the mountains, as they seemed to him to be just the
place for the adventures he was in quest of. they brought back to his
memory the marvellous adventures that had befallen knights-errant in like
solitudes and wilds, and he went along reflecting on these things, so
absorbed and carried away by them that he had no thought for anything
else.

nor had sancho any other care (now that he fancied he was travelling in a
safe quarter) than

great alacrity, and though the valise was secured by a
chain and padlock, from its torn and rotten condition he was able to see
its contents, which were four shirts of fine holland, and other articles
of linen no less curious than clean; and in a handkerchief he found a
good lot of gold crowns, and as soon as he saw them he exclaimed:

"blessed be all heaven for sending us an adventure that is good for
something!"

searching further he found a little memorandum book richly bound; this
don quixote asked of him, telling him to take the money and keep it for
himself. sancho kissed his hands for the favour, and cleared the valise
of its linen, which he stowed away in the provision sack. considering the
whole matter, don quixote observed:

"it seems to me, sancho--and it is impossible it can be otherwise-that
some strayed traveller must have crossed this sierra and been attacked
and slain by footpads, who brought him to this remote spot to bury him."

"that cannot be," answered sanc

ho, "because if they had been robbers they
would not have left this money."

"thou art right," said don quixote, "and i cannot guess or explain what
this may mean; but stay; let us see if in this memorandum book there is
anything written by which we may be able to trace out or discover what we
want to know."

he opened it, and the first thing he found in it, written roughly but in
a very good hand, was a sonnet, and reading it aloud that sancho might
hear it, he found that it ran as follows:

"there is nothing to be learned from that rhyme," said sancho, "unless by
that clue there's in it, one may draw out the ball of the whole matter."

"what clue is there?" said don quixote.

"i thought your worship spoke of a clue in it," said sancho.

"i only said chloe," replied don quixote; "and that no doubt, is the name
of the lady of whom the author of the sonnet complains; and, faith, he
must be a tolerable poet, or i know little of the craft."

"then your worship understands rhyming too?"

"and better than thou thinkest," replied don quixote, "as thou shalt see

or i would have thee know, sancho, that all or
most of the knights-errant in days of yore were great troubadours and
great musicians, for both of these accomplishments, or more properly
speaking gifts, are the peculiar property of lovers-errant: true it is
that the verses of the knights of old have more spirit than neatness in
them."

"read more, your worship," said sancho, "and you will find something that
will enlighten us."

don quixote turned the page and said, "this is prose and seems to be a
letter."

"a correspondence letter, senor?"

"from the beginning it seems to be a love letter," replied don quixote.

"then let your worship read it aloud," said sancho, "for i am very fond
of love matters."

"with all my heart," said don quixote, and reading it aloud as sancho had
requested him, he found it ran thus:

news of my death will reach thy e

when he had finished the letter, don quixote said, "there is less to be
gathered from this than from the verses, except that he who wrote it is
some rejected lover;" and turning over nearly all the pages of the book
he found more verses and letters, some of which he could read, while
others he could not; but they were all made up of complaints, laments,
misgivings, desires and aversions, favours and rejections, some
rapturous, some doleful. while don quixote examined the book, sancho
examined the valise, not leaving a corner in the

he was bareheaded, and notwithstanding the swiftness with which he passed
as has been described, the knight of the rueful countenance observed and
noted all these trifles, and though he made the attempt, he was unable to
follow him, for it was not granted to the feebleness of rocinante to make
way over such rough ground, he being, moreover, slow-paced and sluggish
by nature. don quixote at once came to the conclusion that this was the
owner of the saddle-pad and of the valise, and made up his mind to go in
search of him, even though he should have to wander a year in those
mountains before he found him, and so he directed sancho to take a short
cut over one side of the mountain, while he himself went by the other,
and perhaps by this means they might light upon this man who had passed
so quickly out of their sight.

"i could not do that," said sancho, "for when i separ

ich sancho made answer, "far better would it be not to look for him,
for, if we find him, and he happens to be the owner of the money, it is
plain i must restore it; it would be better, therefore, that without
taking this needless trouble, i should keep possession of it until in
some other less meddlesome and officious way the real owner may be
discovered; and perhaps that will be when i shall have spent it, and then
the king will hold me harmless."

"thou art wrong there, sancho," said don quixote, "for now that we have a
suspicion who the owner is, and have him almost before us, we are bound
to seek him and make restitution; and if we do not see him, the strong
suspicion we have as to his being the owner makes us as guilty as if he
were so; and so, friend sancho, let not our search for him give thee any
uneasiness, for if we find him it will relieve mine."

and so saying he gave rocinante the spur, and sancho followed him on foot
and loaded, and after having partly made the circ

found lying in a ravine, dead and half devoured by dogs and pecked by
jackdaws, a mule saddled and bridled, all which still further
strengthened their suspicion that he who had fled was the owner of the
mule and the saddle-pad.

as they stood looking at it they heard a whistle like that of a shepherd
watching his flock, and suddenly on their left there appeared a great
number of goats and behind them on the summit of the mountain the
goatherd in charge of them, a man advanced in years. don quixote called
aloud to him and begged him to come down to where they stood. he shouted
in return, asking what had brought them to that spot, seldom or never
trodden except by the feet of goats, or of the wolves and other wild
beasts that roamed around. sancho in return bade him come down, and they
would explain all to him.

the goatherd descended, and reaching the place where don quixote stood,
he said, "i will wager you are looking at that hack mule that lies dead
in the hollow there, and, f

aith, it has been lying there now these six

"we have come upon nobody," answered don quixote, "nor on anything except
a saddle-pad and a little valise that we found not far from this."

"i found it too," said the goatherd, "but i would not lift it nor go near
it for fear of some ill-luck or being charged with theft, for the devil
is crafty, and things rise up under one's feet to make one fall without
knowing why or wherefore."

"that's exactly what i say," said sancho; "i found it too, and i would
not go within a stone's throw of it; there i left it, and there it lies
just as

 it was, for i don't want a dog with a bell."

"tell me, good man," said don quixote, "do you know who is the owner of
this property?"

"all i can tell you," said the goatherd, "is that about six months ago,
more or less, there arrived at a shepherd's hut three leagues, perhaps,
away from this, a youth of well-bred appearance and manners, mounted on
that same mule which lies dead here, and with the same saddle-pad and
valise which you say you found and did not touch. he asked us what part
of this sierra was the most rugged and retired; we told him that it was
where we

we do to take him, whether by force or
of his own consent, to the town of almodovar, which is eight leagues from
this, and there strive to cure him (if indeed his malady admits of a
cure), or learn when he is in his senses who he is, and if he has
relatives to whom we may give notice of his misfortune. this, sirs, is
all i can say in answer to what you have asked me; and be sure that the
owner of the articles you found is he whom you saw pass by with such
nimbleness and so naked."

for don quixote had already described how he had seen the man go bounding
along the mountain side, and he was now filled with amazement at what he
heard from the goatherd, and more eager than ever to discover who the
unhappy madman was; and in his heart he resolved, as he had done before,
to search for him all over the mountain, not leaving a corner or cave
unexamined until he had found him. but chance arranged matters better
than he expected or hoped, for at that very moment, in a gorge on the

 that opened where they stood, the youth he wished to find made
his appearance, coming along talking to himself in a way that would have
been unintelligible near at hand, much more at a distance. his garb was
what has been described, save that as he drew near, don quixote perceived
that a tattered doublet which he wore was amber-tanned, from which he
concluded that one who wore such garments could not be of very low rank.

approaching them, the youth greeted them in a harsh and hoarse voice but
with great courtesy. don quixote returned his salutation with equal
politeness, and dismounting from rocinante advanced with well-bred
bearing and grace to embrace him, and held him for some time close in his
arms as if he had known him for a long time. the other,

placing his hands on don quixote's shoulders, stood gazing at him as if
seeking to see whether he knew him, not less amazed, perhaps, at the
sight of the face, figure, and armour of don quixote than don quixote was
at the sight of him. to be brief, the first to speak after embracing was
the ragged one, and he said what will be told farther on.

in which is continued the adventure of the sierra morena


the history relates that it was with the greatest attention don quixote
listened to the ragged knight of the sierra, who began by saying:

"of a surety, senor, whoever you are, for i know you not, i thank you for
the proofs of kindness and courtesy you have shown me, an

"mine," replied don quixote, "is to be of service to you, so much so that
i had resolved not to quit these mountains until i had found you, and
learned of you whether there is any kind of relief to be found for that
sorrow under which from the strangeness of your life you seem to labour;
and to search for you with all possible diligence, if search had been
necessary. and if your misfortune should prove to be one of those that
refuse admission to any sort of consolation, it was my purpose to join
you in lamenting an

in life, to tell me who you are and the cause that has brought you to
live or die in these solitudes like a brute beast, dwelling among them in
a manner so foreign to your condition as your garb and appearance show.
and i swear," added don quixote, "by the order of knighthood which i have
received, and by my vocation of knight-errant, if you gratify me in this,
to serve you with all the zeal my calling demands of me, either in
relieving your misfortune if it admits of relief, or in joining you in
lamenting it as i promised to do."

the knight of the thicket, hearing him of the rueful countenance talk in
this strain, did nothing but stare at him, and stare at him again, and
again survey him from head to foot; and when he had thoro

e corner of a rock. on
reaching it he stretched himself upon the grass, and the others did the
same, all keeping silence, until the ragged one, settling himself in his
place, said:

"if it is your wish, sirs, that i should disclose in a few words the
surpassing extent of my misfortunes, you must promise not to break the
thread of my sad story with any question or other interruption, for the
instant you do so the tale i tell will come to an end."

these words of the ragged one reminded don quixote of the tale his squire
had told him, when he failed to keep count of the goats that had crossed
the river and the story remained unfinished; but to return to the ragged
one, he went on to say:

"i give you this warning because i wish to pass briefly over the story of
my misfortunes, for recalling them to memory only serves to add fresh
ones, and the less you question me the sooner shall i make an end of the
recital, though i shall not omit to relate anything of importance in
order full

y to satisfy your curiosity."

don quixote gave the promise for himself and the others, and with this
assurance he began as follows:

"my name is cardenio, my birthplace one of the best cities of this
andalusia, my family noble, my parents rich, my misfortune so great that
my parents must have wept and my family grieved over it without being
able by their wealth to lighten it; for the gifts of fortune can do
little to relieve reverses sent by heaven. in that same country there was
a heaven in which love had placed all the glory

ably, a circumstance that aroused in me a certain amount of
jealousy; not that i feared any change in the constancy or faith of
luscinda; but still my fate led me to forebode what she assured me
against. don fernando contrived always to read the letters i sent to
luscinda and her answers to me, under the pretence that he enjoyed the
wit and sense of both. it so happened, then, that luscinda having begged
of me a book of chivalry to read, one that she was very fond of, amadis
of gaul-"

don quixote no sooner heard a book of chivalry mentioned, than he said:

"had your worship told me at the beginning of your story that the lady
luscinda was fond of books of chivalry, no other laudation would have
been requisite to impress upon me the superiority of her understanding,
for it could not have been of the excellence you describe had a taste for
such delightful reading been wanting; so, as far as i am concerned, you
need waste no more words in describing her beauty, worth, and

got one of them now, thanks to the spite of wicked and envious
enchanters;--but pardon me for having broken the promise we made not to
interrupt your discourse; for when i hear chivalry or knights-errant
mentioned, i can no more help talking about them than the rays of the sun
can help giving heat, or those of the moon moisture; pardon me,
therefore, and proceed, for that is more to the purpose now."

while don quixote was saying this, cardenio allowed his head to fall upon
his breast, and seemed plunged in deep thought; and though twice don
quixote bade him go on with his story, he neither looked up nor uttered a
word in reply; but after some time he raised his head and said, "i cannot
get rid of the idea, nor will anyone in the world remove it, or make me
think otherwise--and he would be a blockhead who would hold or believe
anything else than that that arrant knave master elisabad made free with

"that is not true, by all that's good," said don quixote in high wrath,
turning upon him angrily, as his way was; "and it is a very great
slander, or rather villainy. queen madasima was a very illustrious lady,
and it is not to be supposed that so exalted a princess would have made
free with a quack; and whoever maintains the contrary lies like a great
scoundrel, and i will give him to know it, on foot or on horseback, armed
or unarmed, by night or by day, or as he likes best."

cardenio was looking at him steadily, and his mad fit having now

on with his story, nor would don
quixote have listened to it, so much had what he had heard about madasima
disgusted him. strange to say, he stood up for her as if she were in
earnest his veritable born lady; to such a pass had his unholy books
brought him. cardenio, then, being, as i said, now mad, when he heard
himself given the lie, and called a scoundrel and other insulting names,
not relishing the jest, snatched up a stone that he found near him, and
with it delivered such a blow on don quixote's breast that he laid him on
his back. sancho panza, seeing his master treated in this fashion,
attacked the madman with his closed fist; but the ragged one received him
in such a way that with a blow of his fist he stretched him at his feet,
and then mounting upon him crushed his ribs to his own satisfaction; the
goatherd, who came to the rescue, shared the same fate; and having beaten
and pummelled them all he left them and quietly withdrew to his
hiding-place on the mountain. sancho r

oured without deserving it, ran to take vengeance
on the goatherd, accusing him of not giving them warning that this man
was at times taken with a mad fit, for if they had known it they would
have been on their guard to protect themselves. the goatherd replied that
he had said so, and that if he had not heard him, that was no fault of

ended in their seizing each other by the beard, and exchanging such
fisticuffs that if don quixote had not made peace between them, they
would have knocked one another to pieces.

"leave me alone, sir knight of the rueful countenance," said sancho,
grappling with the goatherd, "for of this fellow, who is a clown like
myself, and no dubbed knight, i can safely take satisfaction for the
affront he has offered me, fighting with him hand to hand like an honest
man."

"that is true," said don quixote, "but i know that he is not to blame for
what has happened."

with this he pacified t

end of his story. the goatherd told him, as he had told him before, that

with him either in or out of his senses.

don quixote took leave of the goatherd, and once more mounting rocinante
bade sancho follow him, which he having no ass, did very discontentedly.
they proceeded slowly, making their way into the most rugged part of the
mountain, sancho all the while dying to have a talk with his master, and
longing for him to begin, so that there should be no breach of the
injunction laid upon him; but unable to keep silence so long he said to
him:

"senor don quixote, give me your worship's blessing and dismissal,

could talk to rocinante about whatever came into my head, and so put up
with my ill-fortune; but it is a hard case, and not to be borne with
patience, to go seeking adventures all one's life and get nothing but
kicks and blanketings, brickbats and punches, and with all this to have
to sew up one's mouth without daring to say what is in one's heart, just
as if one were dumb."

"i understand thee, sancho," replied don quixote; "thou art dying to have
the interdict i placed upon thy tongue removed; consider it removed, and
say what thou wilt while we are wandering in these mountains."

"so be it," said sancho; "let me speak now, for god knows what will
happen by-and-by; and to take advantage of the permit at once, i ask,
what made your worship stand up so for that queen majimasa, or whatever
her name is, or what did it matter whether that abbot was a friend of
hers or not? for if your worship had let that pas

his story, and the blow of the stone, and the kicks, and more than half a
dozen cuffs would have been escaped."

"in faith, sancho," answered don quixote, "if thou knewest as i do what
an honourable and illustrious lady queen madasima was, i know thou
wouldst say i had great patience that i did not break in pieces the mouth
that uttered such blasphemies, for a very great blasphemy it is to say or
imagine that a queen has made free with a surgeon. the truth of the story
is that that master elisabad whom the madman mentioned was a man of great
prudence and sound judgment, and served as governor and physician to the
queen, but to suppose tha

did not know what he
was saying, remember when he said it he was out of his wits."

"that is what i say," said sancho; "there was no occasion for minding the
words of a madman; for if good luck had not helped your worship, and he
had sent that stone at your head instead of at your breast, a fine way we
should have been in for standing up for my lady yonder, god confound her!
and then, would not cardenio have gone free as a madman?"

"against men in their senses or against madmen," said don quixote, "every
knight-errant is bound to stand up for the honour of women, whoever they
may be, much more for queens of such high degree and dignity as queen
madasima, for whom i have a particular regard on account of her amiable
qualities; for, besides being extremely beautiful, she was very wise, and
very patient under her misfortunes, of which she had many; and the
counsel and society of the master elisabad were a great help and support

"senor," replied sancho, "is it a good rule of chivalry that we should go
astray through these mountains without path or road, looking for a madman
who when he is found will perhaps take a fancy to finish what he began,
not his story, but your worship's head and my ribs, and end by breaking
them altogether for us?"

"peace, i say again, sancho," said don quixote, "for let me tell thee it
is not so much the desire of finding that madman that leads me into these
regions as that which i have of performing among them an achievement
wherewith i shall win eternal name and fame throughout the known world;
and it shall be such that i shall thereby set the seal on all that can
make a knight-errant perfect and famous."

"and is it very perilous, this achievement?"

"no," replied he of the rueful countenance; "though it may be in the dice

"on my diligence!" said sancho.

will soon begin. but as it is not right to keep thee any longer in
suspense, waiting to see what comes of my words, i would have thee know,
sancho, that the famous amadis of gaul was one of the most perfect
knights-errant--i am wrong to say he was one; he stood alone, the first,

so, as it is
easier for me to imitate him in this than in cleaving giants asunder,
cutting off serpents' heads, slaying dragons, routing armies, destroying
fleets, and breaking enchantments, and as this place is so well suited
for a similar purpose, i must not allow the opportunity to escape which
now so conveniently offers me its forelock."

"what is it in reality," said sancho, "that your worship means to do in
such an out-of-the-way place as this?"

"have i not told thee," answered don quixote, "that i mean to imitate
amadis here, playing the victim of despair, the madman, the maniac, so as
at the same time to imitate the valiant don roland, when at the fountain
he had evidence of the fair angelica having disgraced herself with medoro

waters of the clear springs, slew destroyed flocks, burned down huts,
levelled houses, dragged mares after him, and perpetrated a hundred
thousand other outrages worthy of eve

of amadis, who without giving way to any
mischievous madness but merely to tears and sorrow, gained as much fame
as the most famous."

"it seems to me," said sancho, "that the knights who behaved in this way
had provocation and cause for those follies and penances; but what cause
has your worship for going mad? what lady has rejected you, or what
evidence have you found to prove that the lady dulcinea del toboso has
been trifling with moor or christian?"

"there is the point," replied don quixote, "and that is the beauty of
this business of mine; no thanks to a knight-errant for going mad when he
has cause; the thing is to turn crazy without any provocation, and let my
lady know, if i do this in the dry, what i would do in the moist;
moreover i have abundant cause in the long separation i have endured from
my lady till death, dulcinea del toboso; for as thou didst hear that
shepherd ambrosio say the other day, in absence all ills are felt and
feared; and so, friend sancho, waste

heard your worship calling a barber's basin mambrino's helmet without
ever seeing the mistake all this time, but that one who says and
maintains such things must have his brains addled? i have the basin in my
sack all dinted, and i am taking it home to have it mended, to trim my
beard in it, if, by god's grace, i am allowed to see my wife and children
some day or other."

"look here, sancho," said don quixote, "by him thou didst swear by just
now i swear thou hast the most limited understanding that any squire in
the world has or ever had. is it possible that all this time thou hast
been going about with me thou hast never found out that all things

ravings, and to go always by contraries? and not because it really is so,
but because there is always a swarm of enchanters in attendance upon us

nothing of the sort; and indeed, sir knight of the rueful countenance, if
my departure and your worship's madness are to come off in earnest, it
will be as well to saddle rocinante again in order that he may supply the
want of dapple, because it will save me time in going and returning: for
if i go on foot i don't know when i shall get there or when i shall get

"i declare, sancho," returned don quixote, "it shall be as thou wilt, for
thy plan does not seem to me a bad one, and three days hence thou wilt
depart, for i wish thee to observe in the meantime what i do and say for
her sake, that thou mayest be able to tell it."

"but what more have i to see besides what i have seen?" said sancho.

"much thou knowest about it!" said don quixote. "i have now got to tear
up my garments, to scatter about my armour, knock my head against these
rocks, and more of the same sort of thing, which th

hell, or even worse if there be anything worse."

"for one who is in hell," said sancho, "nulla est retentio, as i have
heard say."

"i do not understand what retentio means," said don quixote.

"retentio," answered sancho, "means that whoever is in hell never comes
nor can come out of it, which will be the opposite case with your worship
or my legs will be idle, that is if i have spurs to enliven rocinante:

will not say anything to the contrary."

"that is true," said he of the rueful countenance, "but how shall we
manage to write the letter?"

"and the ass-colt order too," added sancho.

"all shall be included," said don quixote; "and as there is no paper, it
would be well done to write it on the leaves of trees, as the ancients
did, or on tablets of wax; though that would be as hard to find just now
as paper. but it has just occurred to me how it may be conveniently and
even more than conveniently written, and that is in the note-book that
belonged to cardenio, and thou wilt take care to have it copied on paper,

"that is all very well," said sancho, "but the order must needs be
signed, and if it is copied they will say the signature is false, and i
shall be left without ass-colts."

"the order shall go signed in the same book," said don quixote, "and on

knight of the rueful countenance.' and it will be no great matter if it
is in some other person's hand, for as well as i recollect dulcinea can

"so, so!" said sancho; "lorenzo corchuelo's daughter is the lady dulcinea

princess your worship was in love with, or some person great enough to
deserve the rich presents you have sent her, such as the biscayan and the
galley slaves, and many more no doubt, for your worship must have won
many victories in the time when i was not yet your squire. but all things

"i have before now told thee many times, sancho," said don quixote, "that

always striving at sharpness; but to show thee what a fool thou art and
how rational i am, i would have thee listen to a short story. thou must

"i say that your worship is entirely right," said sancho, "and that i am
an ass. but i know not how the name of ass came into my mouth, for a rope
is not to be mentioned in the house of him who has been hanged; but now
for the letter, and then, god be with you, i am off."

don quixote took out the note-book, and, retiring to one side, very
deliberately began to write the letter, and when he had finished it he
called to sancho, saying he wished to read it to him, so that he might
commit it to memory, in case of losing it on the road; for with evil
fortune like his anything might be apprehended. to which sancho replied,

everything as you like in it! and how well you fit in 'the knight of the

"everything is needed for the calling i follow," said don quixote.

"now then," said sancho, "let your worship put the order for the three
ass-colts on the other side, and sign it very plainly, that they may
recognise it at first sight."

"with all my heart," said don quixote, and as he had written it he read
it to this effect:

"mistress niece,--by this first of ass-colts please pay to sancho panza,

"that will do," said sancho; "now let your worship sign it."

"there is no need to sign it," said don quixote, "but merely to put my
flourish, which is the same as a signature, and enough for three asses,
or even three hundred."

"i can trust your worship," returned sancho; "let me go and saddle
rocinante, and be ready to give me your blessing, for i mean to go at
once without seeing the fooleries your worship is going to do; i'll say i
saw you do so many that she will not want any more."

from all this, what has your worship to eat until i come back? will you
sally out on the road like cardenio to force it from the shepherds?"

"do you know what i am afraid of?" said sancho upon this; "that i shall
not be able to find my way back to this spot where i am leaving you, it
is such an out-of-the-way place."

"observe the landmarks well," said don quixote, "for i will try not to go
far from this neighbourhood, and i will even take care to mount the
highest of these rocks to see if i can discover thee returning; however,
not to miss me and lose thyself, the best plan will be to cut some
branches of the broom that is so abundant about here, and as thou goest

"so i will," said sancho panza, and having cut some, he asked his
master's blessing, and not without many tears on both sides, took his
leave of him, and mounting rocinante, of whom don quixote charged him
earnestly to have as much care as of his own person, he set out for the
plain, strewing at intervals the branches of broom as his master had
recommended him; and so he went his way, though don quixote still
entreated him to see him do were it only a couple of mad acts. he had not
gone a hundred paces, however, when he returned and said:

"i must say, senor, your worship said quite right, that in order to be
able to swear without a weight on my conscience that i had seen you do
mad things, it would be well for me to see if it were only one; though in

and the barber of his own village, the same who had carried out the
scrutiny and sentence upon the books; and as soon as they recognised
sancho panza and rocinante, being anxious to hear of don quixote, they
approached, and calling him by his name the curate said, "friend sancho
panza, where is your master?"

sancho recognised them at once, and determined to keep secret the place
and circumstances where and unde

each one; my master is engaged very much to his taste doing penance in
the midst of these mountains;" and then, offhand and without stopping, he
told them how he had left him, what adventures had befallen him, and how
he was carrying a letter to the lady dulcinea del toboso, the daughter of
lorenzo corchuelo, with whom he was over head and ears in love. they were
both amazed at what sancho panza told them; for though they were aware of
don quixote's madness and the nature of it, each time they heard of it
they were filled with fresh wonder. they then asked sancho panza to show
them the letter he was carrying to the lady dulcinea del toboso. he said
it was written in a note-book, and that his master's directions were that
he should have it copied on paper at the first village he came to. on
this the curate said if he showed it to him, he himself would make a fair
copy of it. sancho put his hand into his bosom in search of the note-b

but could not find it, nor, if he had been searching until now, could he
have found it, for don quixote had kept it, and had never given it to
him, nor had he himself thought of asking for it. when sancho discovered
he could not find the book his face grew deadly pale, and in great haste
he again felt his body all over, and seeing plainly it was not to be
found, without more ado he seized his beard with both hands and plucked
away half of it, and then, as quick as he could and without stopping,
gave himself half a dozen cuffs on the face and nose till they were
bathed in blood.

lord was to make a marriage for him (for he would be a widower by that
time, as a matter of course) and was to give him as a wife one of the
damsels of the empress, the heiress of some rich and grand state on the
mainland, having nothing to do with islands of any sort, for he did not
care for them now. all this sancho delivered with so much
composure--wiping his nose from time to time--and with so little
common-sense that his two hearers were again filled with wonder at the
force of don quixote's madness that could run away with this poor man's
reason. they did not care to take the trouble of disabusing him of his
error, as they considered that since it did not in any way hurt his
conscience it would be better to leave him in it, and they would have all
the more amusement in listening to his simplicities; and so they bade him
pray to god for his lord's health, as it was a very likely and a very
feasible thing for him in course of time to come to be an emperor, as he

that he would tell them afterwards the reason why he was unwilling, and
why it did not suit him to enter it; but he begged them to bring him out
something to eat, and to let it be hot, and also to bring barley for
rocinante. they left him and went in, and presently the barber brought
him out something to eat. by-and-by, after they had between them
carefully thought over what they should do to carry out their object, the
curate hit upon an idea very well adapted to humour don quixote, and
effect their purpose; and his notion, which he explained to the barber,
was that he himself should assume the disguise of a wandering damsel,
while the other should try as best he could to pass for a squire, and
that they should thus proceed to where don quixote was, and he,
pretending to be an aggrieved and distressed damsel, should ask a favour
of him, which as a valiant knight-errant he could not refuse to grant;
and the favour he meant to ask him was that he should accompany her

whither she would conduct him, in order to redress a wrong which a wicked
knight had done her, while at the same time she should entreat him not to
require her to remove her mask, nor ask her any question touching her
circumstances until he had righted her with the wicked knight. and he had
no doubt that don quixote would comply with any request made in these
terms, and that in this way they might remove him and take him to his own
village, where they would endeavour to find out if his extraordinary
madness admitted of any kind of remedy.

with other matters worthy of record in this great history

contrary so good that they immediately

they begged a petticoat and hood of the landlady, leaving her in pledge a
new cassock of the curate's; and the barber made a beard out of a
grey-brown or red ox-tail in which the landlord used to stick his comb.
the landlady asked them what they wanted these things for, and the curate
told her in a few words about the madness of don quixote, and how this
disguise was intended to get him away from the mountain where he then
was. the landlord and landlady immediately came to the conclusion that
the madman was their guest, the balsam man and master of the blanketed
squire, and they told the curate all that had passed between him and
them, not omitting what sancho had been so silent about. finally the
landlady dressed up the curate in a style that left nothing to be
desired; she put on him a cloth petticoat with black velvet st

t struck the
curate that he was doing wrong in rigging himself out in that fashion, as
it was an indecorous thing for a priest to dress himself that way even
though much might depend upon it; and saying so to the barber he begged
him to change dresses, as it was fitter he should be the distressed
damsel, while he himself would play the squire's part, which would be
less derogatory to his dignity; otherwise he was resolved to have nothing
more to do with the matter, and let the devil take don quixote. just at
this moment sancho came up, and on seeing the pair in such a costume he
was unable to restrain his laughter; the barber, however, agreed to do as
the curate wished, and, altering their plan, the curate went on to
instruct him how to play his part and what to say to don quixote to
induce and compel him to come with them and give up his fancy for the
place he had chosen for his idle penance. the barber told him he could
manage it properly without any instruction, and as he did not

dress himself up until they were near where don quixote was, he folded up
the garments, and the curate adjusted his beard, and they set out under
the guidance of sancho panza, who went along telling them of the
encounter with the madman they met in the sierra, saying nothing,
however, about the finding of the valise and its contents; for with all
his simplicity the lad was a trifle covetous.

the next day they reached the place where sancho had laid the
broom-branches as marks to direct him to where he had left his master,
and recognising i

take in offering consolation to grief that is beyond the reach of it."

as they, both of them, desired nothing more than to hear from his own
lips the cause of his suffering, they entreated him to tell it, promising
not to do anything for his relief or comfort that he did not wish; and
thereupon the unhappy gentleman began his sad story in nearly the same
words and manner in which he had related it to don quixote and the
goatherd a few days before, when, through master elisabad, and don
quixote's scrupulous observance of what was due to chivalry, the tale was
left unfinished, as this history has already recorded; but now
fortunately the mad fit kept off, allowed him to tell it to the end; and
so, coming to the incident of the note which don fernando had found in
the volume of "amadis of gaul," cardenio said that he remembered it
perfectly and that it was in these words:

"luscinda to cardenio.

e made them; and the barber, who had been listening to all
attentively and in silence, on his part some kindly words also, and with
no less good-will than the curate offered his services in any way that
might be of use to them. he also explained to them in a few words the
object that had brought them there, and the strange nature of don
quixote's madness, and how they were waiting for his squire, who had gone
in search of him. like the recollection of a dream, the quarrel he had
had with don quixote came back to cardenio's memory, and he described it
to the others; but he was unable to say what the dispute was about.

at this moment they heard a shout, and recognised it as coming from
sancho panza, who, not finding them where he had left them, was calling
aloud to them. they went to meet him, and in answer to their inquiries
about don quixote, he told them how he had found him stripped to his
shirt, lank, yellow, half dead with hunger, and sighing for his lady
dulcinea; and althoug

resence of her
beauty until he had done deeds to make him worthy of her favour; and if
this went on, sancho said, he ran the risk of not becoming an emperor as
in duty bound, or even an archbishop, which was the least he could be;
for which reason they ought to consider what was to be done to get him
away from there. the licentiate in reply told him not to be uneasy, for
they would fetch him away in spite of himself. he then told cardenio and
dorothea what they had proposed to do to cure don quixote, or at any rate
take him home; upon which dorothea said that she could play the
distressed damsel better than the barber; especially as she had there the
dress in which to do it to the life, and that they might trust to her
acting the part in every particular requisite for carrying out their
scheme, for she had read a great many books of chivalry, and knew exactly
the style in which afflicted damsels begged boons of knights-errant.

"in that case," said the curate, "there is nothing mor

curate; "and as for your master's marrying, i will
do all in my power towards it:" with which sancho was as much pleased as
the curate was amazed at his simplicity and at seeing what a hold the
absurdities of his master had taken of his fancy, for he had evidently
persuaded himself that he was going to be an emperor.

by this time dorothea had seated herself upon the curate's mule, and the
barber had fitted the ox-tail beard to his face, and they now told sancho
to conduct them to where don quixote was, warning him not to say that he
knew either the licentiate or the barber, as his master's becoming an
emperor entirely depended on his not recognising them; neither the curate
nor cardenio, however, thought fit to go with them; cardenio lest he
should remind don quixote of the quarrel he had with him, and the curate
as there was no necessity for his presence just yet, so they allowed the
others to go on before them, while they themselves followed slowly on
foot. the curate did not fo

rget to instruct dorothea how to act, but she
said they might make their minds easy, as everything would be done
exactly as the books of chivalry required and described.

they had gone about three-quarters of a league when they discovered don
quixote in a wilderness of rocks, by this time clothed, but without his
armour; and as soon as dorothea saw him and was told by sancho that that
was don quixote, she whipped her palfrey, the well-bearded barber
following her, and on coming up to him her squire sprang from his mule
and came forward to receive her in his arms, and she dismounting with
great ease of manner advanced to kneel before the feet of don quixote;
and though he strove to raise her up, she without rising addressed him in
this fashion:

"from this spot i will not rise, valiant and doughty knight, until your
goodness and courtesy grant me a boon, which will redound to the hon

and afflicted damsel the sun has seen; and if the might of your strong
arm corresponds to the repute of your immortal fame, you are bound to aid
the helpless being who, led by the savour of your renowned name, hath
come from far distant lands to seek your aid in her misfortunes."

"i will not answer a word, beauteous lady," replied don quixote, "nor
will i listen to anything further concerning you, until you rise from the
earth."

"i will not rise, senor," answered the afflicted damsel, "unless of your
courtesy the boon i ask is first granted me."

"i grant and accord it," said don quixote, "provided without detriment or
prejudice to my king, my country, or her who holds the key of my heart
and freedom, it may be complied with."

"it will not be to the detriment or prejudice of any of them, my worthy
lord," said the affli

cted damsel; and here sancho panza drew close to his
master's ear and said to him very softly, "your worship may very safely
grant the boon she asks; it's nothing at all; only to kill a big giant;
and she who asks it is the exalted princess micomicona, queen of the
great kingdom of micomicon of ethiopia."

"let her be who she may," replied don quixote, "i will do what is my
bounden duty, and what my conscience bids me, in conformity with what i
have professed;" and turning to the damsel he said, "let your great
beauty rise, for i grant the boon which you would ask of me."

"then what i ask," said the damsel, "is that your magnanimous person
accompany me at once whither i will conduct you, and that you promise not
to engage in any other adventure or quest until you have avenged me of a
traitor who against all human and divine law, has

 usurped my kingdom."

"i repeat that i grant it," replied don quixote; "and so, lady, you may
from this day forth lay aside the melancholy that distresses you, and let
your failing hopes gather new life and strength, for with the help of god
and of my arm you will soon see yourself restored to your kingdom, and
seated upon the throne of your ancient and mighty realm, notwithstanding
and despite of the felons who would gainsay it; and now hands to the
work, for in delay there is apt to be danger."

the distressed damsel strove with much pertinacity to kiss

 his hands; but
don quixote, who was in all things a polished and courteous knight, would
by no means allow it, but made her rise and embraced her with great
courtesy and politeness, and ordered sancho to look to rocinante's
girths, and to arm him without a moment's delay. sancho took down the
armour, which was hung up on a tree like a trophy, and having seen to the
girths armed his master in a trice, who as soon as he found himself in
his armour exclaimed:

"let us be gone in the name of god to bring aid to this

great lady."

the barber was all this time on his knees at great pains to hide his
laughter and not let his beard fall, for had it fallen maybe their fine
scheme would have come to nothing; but now seeing the boon granted, and
the promptitude with which don quixote prepared to set out in compliance
with it, he rose and took his lady's hand, and between them they placed
her upon the mule. don quixote then mounted rocinante, and the barber
settled himself on his beast, sancho being left to go on foot, which made
him feel anew the loss of his dapple, finding the want of him now. but he
bore all with cheerfulness, being persuaded that his master had now
fairly started and was just on the point of becoming an emperor; for he
felt no doubt at all that he would marry this princess, and be king of
micomicon at least. the only thing that troubled him was the reflection
that this kingdom was

kward places they encountered did not allow those
on horseback to go as fast as those on foot. they then posted themselves
on the level ground at the outlet of the sierra, and as soon as don
quixote and his companions emerged from it the curate began to examine
him very deliberately, as though he were striving to recognise him, and
after having stared at him for some time he hastened towards him with
open arms exclaiming, "a happy meeting with the mirror of chivalry, my
worthy compatriot don quixote of la mancha, the flower and cream of high
breeding, the protection and relief of the distressed, the quintessence
of knights-errant!" and so saying he clasped in his arms the knee of don
quixote's left leg. he, astonished at the stranger's words and behaviour,
looked at him attentively, and at length recognised him, very much
surprised to see him there, and made great efforts to dismount. this,
however, the curate would not allow, on which don quixote said, "permit
me, senor licentiate,

 saying ill-conditioned,
lifted its hind hoofs and let fly a couple of kicks in the air, which
would have made master nicholas wish his expedition in quest of don
quixote at the devil had they caught him on the breast or head. as it
was, they so took him by surprise that he came to the ground, giving so
little heed to his beard that it fell off, and all he could do when he
found himself without it was to cover his face hastily with both his
hands and moan that his teeth were knocked out. don quixote when he saw
all that bundle of beard detached, without jaws or blood, from the face
of the fallen squire, exclaimed:

"by the living god, but this is a great miracle! it has knocked off and
plucked away the beard from his face as if it had been shaved off
designedly."

the curate, seeing the danger of discovery that threatened his scheme, at
once pounced upon the beard and hastened with it to where master nicholas
lay, still uttering moans, and drawing his head to his breast had it on

in an instant, muttering over him some words which he said were a certain
special charm for sticking on beards, as they would see; and as soon as
he had it fixed he left him, and the squire appeared well bearded and
whole as before, whereat don quixote was beyond measure astonished, and
begged the curate to teach him that charm when he had an opportunity, as
he was persuaded its virtue must extend beyond the sticking on of beards,
for it was clear that where the beard had been stripped off the flesh
must have remained torn and lacerated, and when it could heal all that it
must be good for more than beards.

"and so it is," said the curate, and he promised to teach it to him on
the first opportunity. they then agreed that for the prese

the inn, which might be about six leagues from where they were.

three then being mounted, that is to say, don quixote, the princess, and
the curate, and three on foot, cardenio, the barber, and sancho panza,
don quixote said to the damsel:

"let your highness, lady, lead on whithersoever is most pleasing to you;"
but before she could answer the licentiate said:

"towards what kingdom would your ladyship direct our course? is it
perchance towards that of micomicon? it must be, or else i know little
about kingdoms."

she, being ready on all points, understood that she was to answer "yes,"
so she said "yes, senor, my way lies towards that kingdom."

"in that case," said the curate, "we must pass right

able to embark, fortune favouring; and if the wind be fair and the sea
smooth and tranquil, in somewhat less than nine years you may come in
sight of the great lake meona, i mean meotides, which is little more than
a hundred days' journey this side of your highness's kingdom."

"your worship is mistaken, senor," said she; "for it is not two years
since i set out from it, and though i never had good weather,
nevertheless i am here to behold what i so longed for, and that is my
lord don quixote of la mancha, whose fame came to my ears as soon as i
set foot in spain and impelled me to go in search of him, to commend
myself to his courtesy, and entrust the justice of my cause to the might
of his invincible arm."

"enough; no more praise," said don quixote at this, "for i hate all
flattery; and though this may not be so, still language of the kind is
offensive to my chaste ears. i will only say, senora, that whether it has
might or not, that which it may or may not have shall be

service even to death; and now, leaving this to its proper season, i
would ask the senor licentiate to tell me what it is that has brought him
into these parts, alone, unattended, and so lightly clad that i am filled
with amazement."

"i will answer that briefly," replied the curate; "you must know then,
senor don quixote, that master nicholas, our friend and barber, and i
were going to seville to receive some money that a relative of mine who
went to the indies many years ago had sent me, and not such a small sum
but that it was over sixty thousand pieces of eight, full weight, which
is something; and passing by this place yesterday we were attacked by
four footpads, who stripped us even to our beards, and them they stripped
off so that the barber found it necessary to put on a false one, and even

their feet, stirred up the holy brotherhood which for many years past has
been quiet, and, lastly, has done a deed by which his soul may be lost
without any gain to his body." sancho had told the curate and the barber
of the adventure of the galley slaves, which, so much to his glory, his
master had achieved, and hence the curate in alluding to it made the most
of it to see what would be said or done by don quixote; who changed
colour at every word, not daring to say that it was he who had been the
liberator of those worthy people. "these, then," said the curate, "were
they who robbed us; and god in his mercy pardon him who would not let
them go to the punishment they deserved."

about, and that it was a sin to set them at liberty, as they were all on
the march there because they were special scoundrels."

"blockhead!" said don quixote at this, "it is no business or concern of
knights-errant to inquire whether any persons in affliction, in chains,
or oppressed that they may meet on the high roads go that way and suffer
as they do because of their faults or because of their misfortunes. it
only concerns them to aid them as persons in need of help, having regard
to their sufferings and not to their rascalities. i encountered a chaplet

and lies like a whoreson villain, and this i will give him to know to the
fullest extent with my sword;" and so saying he settled himself in his
stirrups and pressed down his morion; for the barber's basin, which
according to him was mambrino's helmet, he carried hanging at the
saddle-bow until he could repair the damage done to it by the galley
slaves.

dorothea, who was shrewd and sprightly, and by this time thoroughly
understood don quixote's crazy turn, and that all except sancho panza
were making game of him, not to be behind the rest said to him, on
observing his irritation, "sir knight, remember the boon you have
promised me, and that in accordance with it you must not engage in any
other adventure, be it ever so pressing; calm yourself, for if the
licentiate had known that the galley slaves had been set free by that
unconquered arm he would have stopped his mouth thrice over, or even

tended towards disrespect of your worship."

"that i swear heartily," said the curate, "and i would have even plucked
off a moustache."

"i will hold my peace, senora," said don quixote, "and i will curb the
natural anger that had arisen in my breast, and will proceed in peace and
quietness until i have fulfilled my promise; but in return for this
consideration i entreat you to tell me, if you have no objection to do
so, what is the nature of your trouble, and how many, who, and what are
the persons of whom i am to require due satisfaction, and on whom i am to
take vengeance on your behalf?"

"that i will do with all my heart," replied dorothea, "if it will not be

"it will not be wearisome, senora," said don quixote; to which dorothea
replied, "well, if that be so, give me your attention." as soon as she
said this, cardenio and the barber drew close to her side, eager to hear
what sort of story the quick-witted dorothea would invent for herself;
and sancho did the same, for he was as much taken in by her as his
master; and she having settled herself comfortably in the saddle, and
with the help of coughing and other preliminaries taken time to think,
began with great sprightliness of manner in this f

loyal vassals, for there would be no possibility of defending myself
against the giant's devilish power; and that i should at once with some
of my followers set out for spain, where i should obtain relief in my
distress on finding a certain knight-errant whose fame by that time would
extend over the whole kingdom, and who would be called, if i remember
rightly, don azote or don gigote."

"'don quixote,' he must have said, senora," observed sancho at this,
"otherwise called the knight of the rueful countenance."

"that is it," said dorothea; "he said, moreover, that he would be tall of
stature and lank featured; and that on his right side under the left
shoulder, or thereabouts, he would have a grey mole with hairs like
bristles."

on hearing this, don quixote said to his squire, "here, sancho my son,
bear a hand and help me to strip, for i want to see if i am the knight

"what does your worship want to strip for?" said dorothea.

"to see if i have that mole your father spoke of," answered don quixote.

"there is no occasion to strip," said sancho; "for i know your worship
has just such a mole on the middle of your backbone, which is the mark of
a strong man."

"that is enough," said dorothea, "for with friends we must not look too
closely into trifles; and whether it be on the shoulder or on the
backbone matters little; it is enough if there is a mole, be it where it
may, for it is all the same flesh; no doubt my good father hit the truth
in every particular, and i have made a luc

ky hit in commending myself to
don quixote; for he is the one my father spoke of, as the features of his
countenance correspond with those assigned to this knight by that wide
fame he has acquired not only in spain but in all la mancha; for i had
scarcely landed at osuna when i heard such accounts of his achievements,
that at once my heart told me he was the very one i had come in search
of."

"but how did you land at osuna, senora," asked don quixote, "when it is
not a seaport?"

but before dorothea could reply the curate anticipated her, saying, "the
princess meant to say that after she had landed at malaga the first place
where she heard of your worship was osuna."

"that is what i meant to say," said dorothea.

"and that would be only natural," said the curate. "will your majesty
please proceed?"

"there is no more to add," said dorothea, "save that in finding don
quixote i have had such good fortune, that i already reckon a

i cannot read them), that if this predicted knight, after having cut the
giant's throat, should be disposed to marry me i was to offer myself at
once without demur as his lawful wife, and yield him possession of my
kingdom together with my person."

"what thinkest thou now, friend sancho?" said don quixote at this.
"hearest thou that? did i not tell thee so? see how we have already got a
kingdom to govern and a queen to marry!"

"on my oath it is so," said sancho; "and foul fortune to him who won't
marry after slitting senor pandahilado's windpipe! and then, how
ill-favoured the queen is! i wish the fleas in my bed were that sort!"

and so saying he cut a couple of capers in the air with every sign of
extreme satisfaction, and then ran to seize the bridle of dorothea's
mule, and checkin

d when in sight of port; and he and i came to land
on a couple of planks as if by a miracle; and indeed the whole course of
my life is a miracle and a mystery as you may have observed; and if i
have been over minute in any respect or not as precise as i ought, let it
be accounted for by what the licentiate said at the beginning of my tale,
that constant and excessive troubles deprive the sufferers of their
memory."

"they shall not deprive me of mine, exalted and worthy princess," said
don quixote, "however great and unexampled those which i shall endure in
your service may be; and here i confirm anew the boon i have promised
you, and i swear to go with you to the end of the world until i find
myself in the presence of your fierce enemy, whose haughty head i trust
by the aid of my arm to cut off with the edge of this--i will not say
good sword, thanks to gines de pasamonte who carried away mine"--(this he
said between his teeth, and then continued), "and when it has been cut

be left to your own decision to dispose of your person as may be most
pleasing to you; for so long as my memory is occupied, my will enslaved,
and my understanding enthralled by her-i say no more--it is impossible
for me for a moment to contemplate marriage, even with a phoenix."

the last words of his master about not wanting to marry were so
disagreeable to sancho that raising his voice he exclaimed with great
irritation:

"by my oath, senor don quixote, you are not in your right senses; for how
can your worship possibly object to marrying such an exalted princess as
this? do you think fortune will offer you behind every stone such a piece
of luck as is offered you now? is my lady dulcinea fairer, perchance? not
she; nor half as fair; and i will even go so far as to say she does not
come up to the shoe of this one here. a poor chance i have of getting

kingdom that comes to hand without any trouble, and when you are king
make me a marquis or governor of a province, and for the rest let the
devil take it all."

don quixote, when he heard such blasphemies uttered against his lady
dulcinea, could not endure it, and lifting his pike, without saying
anything to sancho or uttering a word, he gave him two such thwacks that
he brought him to the ground; and had it not been that dorothea cried out
to him to spare him he would have no doubt taken his life on the spot.

"do you think," he said to him after a pause, "you scurvy clown, that you
are to be always interfering with me, and that you are to be always

g so,
how can you bestow favours upon me? that is what i complain of. let your
worship at any rate marry this queen, now that we have got her here as if
showered down from heaven, and afterwards you may go back to my lady
dulcinea; for there must have been kings in the world who kept
mistresses. as to beauty, i have nothing to do with it; and if the truth
is to be told, i like them both; though i have never seen the lady
dulcinea."

"how! never seen her, blasphemous traitor!" exclaimed don quixote; "hast
thou not just now brought me a message from her?"

"i mean," said sancho, "that i did not see her so much at my leisure that
i could take particular notice of her beauty, or of her charms piecemeal;
but taken in the lump i like her."

"now i forgive thee," said don quixote; "and do thou forgive me the
injury i have done thee; for our first impulses are not in our control."

"that i see," replied sancho, "and with me the wish to speak is always
the first impulse, and i cannot h

"for all that, sancho," said don quixote, "take heed of what thou sayest,

"well, well," said sancho, "god is in heaven, and sees all tricks, and
will judge who does most harm, i in not speaking right, or your worship
in not doing it."

"that is enough," said dorothea; "run, sancho, and kiss your lord's hand
and beg his pardon, and henceforward be more circumspect with your praise
and abuse; and say nothing in disparagement of that lady toboso, of whom

, "since thy return i have had no opportunity or time
to ask thee many particulars touching thy mission and the answer thou
hast brought back, and now that chance has granted us the time and
opportunity, deny me not the happiness thou canst give me by such good
news."

"let your worship ask what you will," answered sancho, "for i shall find
a way out of all as as i found a way in; but i implore you, senor, not
not to be so revengeful in future."

"why dost thou say that, sancho?" said don quixote.

"i say it," he returned, "because those blows just now were more because
of the quarrel the devil stirred up between us both the other night, than
for what i said against my lady dulcinea, whom i love and reverence as i
would a relic--though there is nothing of that about her--merely as
something belonging to your worship."

"say no more on that subject for thy life, sancho," said don quixote,
"for it is displeasing to me; i have already pardoned thee for that, and
thou knowest the

words or objurgations, for at the
first one gines jumped down, and at a like racing speed made off and got
clear of them all. sancho hastened to his dapple, and embracing him he
said, "how hast thou fared, my blessing, dapple of my eyes, my comrade?"
all the while kissing him and caressing him as if he were a human being.
the ass held his peace, and let himself be kissed and caressed by sancho
without answering a single word. they all came up and congratulated him
on having found dapple, don quixote especially, who told him that
notwithstanding this he would not cancel the order for the three
ass-colts, for which sancho thanked him.

while the two had been going along conversing in this fashion, the curate
observed to dorothea that she had shown great cleverness, as well in the
story itself as in its conciseness, and the resemblance it bore to those
of the books of chivalry. she said that she had many times amused herself
reading them; but that she did not know the situation of the

to imagine it."

"but another strange thing about it," said the curate, "is that, apart
from the silly things which this worthy gentleman says in connection with
his craze, when other subjects are dealt with, he can discuss them in a
perfectly rational manner, showing that his mind is quite clear and
composed; so that, provided his chivalry is not touched upon, no one
would take him to be anything but a man of thoroughly sound
understanding."

while they were holding this conversation don quixote continued his with
sancho, saying:

"friend panza, let us forgive and forget as to our quarrels, and tell me
now, dismissing anger and irritation, where, how, and when didst thou
find dulcinea? what was she doing? what didst thou say to her? what did
she answer? how did she look when she was reading my letter? who copied
it out for thee? and everything in the matter that seems to thee worth
knowing, asking, and learning; neither adding nor falsifying to give me
pleasure, nor yet curtai

ling lest you should deprive me of it."

"senor," replied sancho, "if the truth is to be told, nobody copied out
the letter for me, for i carried no letter at all."

"it is as thou sayest," said don quixote, "for the note-book in which i
wrote it i found in my own possession two days after thy departure, which
gave me very great vexation, as i knew not what thou wouldst do on
finding thyself without any letter; and i made sure thou wouldst return
from the place where thou didst first miss it."

"so i should have done," said sancho, "if i had not got it by heart when
your worship read it to me, so that i repeated it to a sacristan, who
copied it out for me from hearing it, so exactly that h

e said in all the
days of his life, though he had read many a letter of excommunication, he
had never seen or read so pretty a letter as that."

"and hast thou got it still in thy memory, sancho?" said don quixote.

"no, senor," replied sancho, "for as soon as i had repeated it, seeing
there was no further use for it, i set about forgetting it; and if i
recollect any of it, it is that about 'scrubbing,'i mean to say
'sovereign lady,' and the end 'yours till death, the knight of the rueful
countenance;' and between these two i put into it more than three hundred
'my souls' and 'my life's' and 'my eyes."

squire, together with other incidents


"all that is not unsatisfactory to me," said don quixote. "go on; thou
didst reach her; and what was that queen of beauty doing? surely thou
didst find her stringing pearls, or embroidering some device in gold
thread for this her enslaved knight."

"i did not," said sancho, "but i found her winnowing two bushels of wheat
in the yard of her house."

"then depend upon it," said don quixote, "the grains of that wheat were
pearls when touched by her hands; and didst thou look, friend? was it
white wheat or brown?"

"it was neither, but red," said sancho.

"then i promise thee," said don quixote, "that, winnowed by her hands,
beyond a doubt the bread it made was of the whitest; but go on; when thou
gavest her my letter, did she kiss it? did she place it on her head? did
she perform any ceremony befitting it, or what did she do?"

"when i went to give it to her," replied s

ancho, "she was hard at it
swaying from side to side with a lot of wheat she had in the sieve, and
she said to me, 'lay the letter, friend, on the top of that sack, for i
cannot read it until i have done sifting all this."

"discreet lady!" said don quixote; "that was in order to read it at her
leisure and enjoy it; proceed, sancho; while she was engaged in her
occupation what converse did she hold with thee? what did she ask about
me, and what answer didst thou give? make haste; tell me all, and let not
an atom be left behind in the ink-bottle."

"she asked me nothing," said sancho; "but i told her how your worship was
left doing penance in her service, naked from the waist up, in among
these mountains like a savage, sleeping on the groun

fortune."

"in saying i cursed my fortune thou saidst wrong," said don quixote; "for
rather do i bless it and shall bless it all the days of my life for
having made me worthy of aspiring to love so lofty a lady as dulcinea del
toboso."

"and so lofty she is," said sancho, "that she overtops me by more than a
hand's-breadth."

"what! sancho," said don quixote, "didst thou measure with her?"

"i measured in this way," said sancho; "going to help her to put a sack
of wheat on the back of an ass, we came so close together that i could
see she stood more than a good palm over me."

"well!" said don quixote, "and doth she not of a truth accompany and
adorn this greatness with a thousand million charms of mind! but one
thing thou wilt not deny, sancho; when thou camest close to her didst
thou not perceive a sabaean odour, an aromatic fragrance, a

what, delicious, that i cannot find a name for; i mean a redolence, an
exhalation, as if thou wert in the shop of some dainty glover?"

"all i can say is," said sancho, "that i did perceive a little odour,
something goaty; it must have been that she was all in a sweat with hard
work."

"it could not be that," said don quixote, "but thou must have been
suffering from cold in the head, or must have smelt thyself; for i know
well what would be the scent of that rose among thorns, that lily of the
field, that dissolved amber."

"maybe so," replied sancho; "there often comes from myself that same
odour which then seemed to me to come from her grace the lady dulcinea;
but that's no wonder, for one devil is like another."

"well then," continued don quixote, "now she has done sifting the corn

absurdities, and to set out at once for el toboso, unless something else
of greater importance should happen, for she had a great desire to see
your worship. she laughed greatly when i told her how your worship was
called the knight of the rueful countenance; i asked her if that biscayan
the other day had been there; and she told me he had, and that he was an
honest fellow; i asked her too about the galley slaves, but she said she
had not seen any as yet."

"so far all goes well," said don quixote; "but tell me what jewel was it
that she gave thee on taking thy leave, in return for thy tidings of me?
for it is a usual and ancient custom with knights and ladies errant to
give the squires, damsels, or dwarfs who bring tidings of their ladies to
the knights, or of their knights to the ladies, some rich jewel as a
guerdon for good news,' and acknowledgment of the message."

"that is very likely," said sancho, "and a good custom it was, to my
mind; but that must have been in days gone

 by, for now it would seem to
be the custom only to give a piece of bread and cheese; because that was
what my lady dulcinea gave me over the top of the yard-wall when i took
leave of her; and more by token it was sheep's-milk cheese."

"she is generous in the extreme," said don quixote, "and if she did not
give thee a jewel of gold, no doubt it must have been because she had not
one to hand there to give thee; but sleeves are good after easter; i
shall see her and all shall be made right. but knowest thou what amazes
me, sancho? it seems to me thou must have gone and come through the air,

and return, though it is more than thirty leagues from here to there.

done by the craft and skill of the sage enchanters who take care of those
valiant knights; so that, friend sancho, i find no difficulty in
believing that thou mayest have gone from this place to el toboso and
returned in such a short time, since, as i have said, some friendly sage
must have carried thee through the air without thee perceiving it."

"that must have been it," said sancho, "for indeed rocinante went like a
gipsy's ass with quicksilver in his ears."

"quicksilver!" said don quixote, "aye and what is more, a legion of
devils, folk that can travel and make others travel without being weary,
exactly as the whim seizes them. but putting this aside, what thinkest
thou i ought to do about my lady's command to go and see her? for though
i feel that i am bound to obey her mandate, i feel too that i am debarred
by the boon i have accorded to the princess that accompanies us, and the
law of chivalry compels me to have regard for my word in preference to my
inclination; on th

od! blush for what you have said,
and take my advice, and forgive me, and marry at once in the first
village where there is a curate; if not, here is our licentiate who will
do the business beautifully; remember, i am old enough to give advice,
and this i am giving comes pat to the purpose; for a sparrow in the hand
is better than a vulture on the wing, and he who has the good to his hand
and chooses the bad, that the good he complains of may not come to him."

"look here, sancho," said don quixote. "if thou art advising me to marry,
in order that immediately on slaying the giant i may become king, and be
able to confer favours on thee, and give thee what i have promised, let
me tell thee i shall be able very easily to satisfy thy desires without
marrying; for before going into battle i will make it a stipulation that,
if i come out of it victorious, even i do not marry, they shall give me a
portion of the kingdom, that i may bestow it upon whomsoever i
choose, and when they give i

thou have me bestow
it but upon thee?"

"that is plain speaking," said sancho; "but let your worship take care to
choose it on the seacoast, so that if i don't like the life, i may be
able to ship off my black vassals and deal with them as i have said;
don't mind going to see my lady dulcinea now, but go and kill this giant
and let us finish off this business; for by god it strikes me it will be
one of great honour and great profit."

"i hold thou art in the right of it, sancho," said don quixote, "and i
will take thy advice as to accompanying the princess before going to see
dulcinea; but i counsel thee not to say anything to any one, or to those
who are with us, about what we have considered and discussed, for as
dulcinea is so decorous that she does not wish her thoughts to be known
it is not right that i or anyone for me should disclose them."

"well then, if that be so," said sancho, "how is it that your worship
makes all those you overcome by your arm go to present themsel

my lady dulcinea, this being the same thing as signing your name to it
that you love her and are her lover? and as those who go must perforce
kneel before her and say they come from your worship to submit themselves
to her, how can the thoughts of both of you be hid?"

"o, how silly and simple thou art!" said don quixote; "seest thou not,
sancho, that this tends to her greater exaltation? for thou must know
that according to our way of thinking in chivalry, it is a high honour to
a lady to have many knights-errant in her service, whose thoughts never
go beyond serving her for her own sake, and who look for no other reward
for their great and true devotion than that she should be willing to
accept them as her knights."

"it is with that kind of love," said sancho, "i have heard preachers say
we ought to

 love our lord, for himself alone, without being moved by the
hope of glory or the fear of punishment; though for my part, i would
rather love and serve him for what he could do."

master nicholas here called out to them to wait a while, as they wanted
to halt and drink at a little spring there was there. don quixote drew
up, not a little to the satisfaction of sancho, for he was by this time
weary of telling so many lies, and in dread of his master catching him
tripping, for though he knew that dulcinea was a peasant girl of el
toboso, he had never seen her in all his life. cardenio had now put on
the clothes which dorothea was wearing when they found her, and though
they were not very good, they were far better than those he put off. they
dismounted together by the side of the spring, and with what

 the curate
had provided himself with at the inn they appeased, though not very well,
the keen appetite they all of them brought with them.

while they were so employed there happened to come by a youth passing on
his way, who stopping to examine the party at the spring, the next moment
ran to don quixote and clasping him round the legs, began to weep freely,
saying, "o, senor, do you not know me? look at me well; i am that lad
andres that your worship released from the oak-tree where i was tied."

don quixote recognised him, and taking his hand he turned to those
present and said: "that your worships may see how important it is to have
knights-errant to redress the wrongs and injuries done by tyrannical and
wicked men in this world, i may tell you that some days ago passing

he promised to do all i enjoined, specified, and required of him? answer
without hesitation; tell these gentlemen what took place, that they may
see that it is as great an advantage as i say to have knights-errant
abroad."

"all that your worship has said is quite true," answered the lad; "but
the end of the business turned out just the opposite of what your worship
supposes."

"how! the opposite?" said don quixote; "did not the clown pay thee then?"

"not only did he not pay me," replied the lad, "but as soon as your
worship had passed out of the wood and we were alone, he tied me up again
to the same oak and gave me a fresh flogging, that left me like a flayed
saint bartholomew; and every stroke he gave me he followed up with some
jest or gibe about having made a fool of your worship, and but for the
pain i was suffering i should have laughed at the things he said. in
short he left me in such a

giving me one or two dozen lashes, and would have then loosed me and paid
me what he owed me; but when your worship abused him so out of measure,
and gave him so many hard words, his anger was kindled; and as he could
not revenge himself on you, as soon as he saw you had left him the storm
burst upon me in such a way, that i feel as if i should never be a man
again."

"the mischief," said don quixote, "lay in my going away; for i should not
have gone until i had seen thee paid; because i ought to have known well
by long experience that there is no clown who will keep his word if he
finds it will not suit him to keep it; but thou rememberest, andres, that
i swore if he did not pay thee i would go and seek him, and find him
though he were to hide himself in the whale's belly."

"that is true," said andres; "but it was of no use."

d don quixote; and
so saying, he got up hastily and bade sancho bridle rocinante, who was
browsing while they were eating. dorothea asked him what he meant to do.
he replied that he meant to go in search of this clown and chastise him
for such iniquitous conduct, and see andres paid to the last maravedi,
despite and in the teeth of all the clowns in the world. to which she
replied that he must remember that in accordance with his promise he
could not engage in any enterprise until he had concluded her

as he knew this better than anyone, he should restrain his ardour until
his return from her kingdom.

"that is true," said don quixote, "and andres must have patience until my

until i have seen him avenged and paid."

"i have no faith in those oaths," said andres; "i would rather have now
something to help me to get to seville than all the revenges in the
world; if you have here anything to eat that i can take with me, give it
me, and god be with your worship and all knights-errant; and may their

, and seeing that nobody gave him
anything more, bent his head, and took hold of the road, as the saying
is. however, before leaving he said, "for the love of god, sir
knight-errant, if you ever meet me again, though you may see them cutting
me to pieces, give me no aid or succour, but leave me to my misfortune,
which will not be so great but that a greater will come to me by being
helped by your worship, on whom and all the knights-errant that have ever
been born god send his curse."

don quixote was getting up to chastise him, but he took to his heels at
such a pace that no one attempted to follow him; and mightily chapfallen
was don quixote at andres' story, and the others had to take great care
to restrain their laughter so as not to put him entirely out of
countenance.

sancho panza's fear and dread; but though he would have rather not

daughter, and maritornes, when they saw don quixote and sancho coming,
went out to welcome them with signs of hearty satisfaction, which don
quixote received with dignity and gravity, and bade them make up a better
bed for him than the last time: to which the landlady replied that if he
paid better than he did the last time she would give him one fit for a
prince. don quixote said he would, so they made up a tolerable one for
him in the same garret as before; and he lay down at once, being sorely
shaken and in want of sleep.

"by my faith you are not going to make a beard of my tail any longer; you
must give me back tail, for it is a shame the way that thing of my

stick in my good tail."

but for all she tugged at it the barber would not give it up until the
licentiate told him to let her have it, as there was now no further
occasion for that stratagem, because he might declare himself and appear
in his own character, and tell don quixote that he had fled to this inn
when those thieves the galley slaves robbed him; and should he ask for
the princess's squire, they could tell him that she had sent him on
before her to give notice to the people of her kingdom that she was
coming, and bringing with her the deliverer of them all. on this the
barber cheerfully restored the tail to the landlady, and at the same time
they returned all the accessories they had borrowed to effect don
quixote's deliverance. all the people of the in

astonishment at the beauty of dorothea, and even at the comely figure of
the shepherd cardenio. the curate made them get ready such fare as there
was in the inn, and the landlord, in hope of better payment, served them
up a tolerably good dinner. all this time don quixote was asleep, and
they thought it best not to waken him, as sleeping would now do him more
good than eating.

while at dinner, the company consisting of the landlord, his wife, their
daughter, maritornes, and all the travellers, they discussed the strange
craze of don quixote and the manner in which he had been found; and the
landlady told them what had taken place between him and the carrier; and
then, looking round to see if sancho was there, when she saw he was not,
she gave them the

chivalry which don quixote had read that had turned his brain, the
landlord said:

"i cannot understand how that can be, for in truth to my mind there is no
better reading in the world, and i have here two or three of them, with
other writings that are the very life, not only of myself but of plenty
more; for when it is harvest-time, the reapers flock here on holidays,

into an old ancient man, who told him such things as were never heard.
hold your peace, senor; for if you were to hear this you would go mad
with delight. a couple of figs for your great captain and your diego
garcia!"

hearing this dorothea said in a whisper to cardenio, "our landlord is
almost fit to play a second part to don quixote."

"i think so," said cardenio, "for, as he shows, he accepts it as a
certainty that everything those books relate took place exactly as it is
written down; and the barefooted friars themselves would not persuade him
to the contrary."

"but consider, brother," said the curate once more, "there never was any
felixmarte of hircania in the world, nor any cirongilio of thrace, or any
of the other knights of the same sort, that the books of chivalry talk
of; the whole thing is the fabricat

ones, that would be to the advantage and even to the taste of some; but i
hope the time will come when i can communicate my ideas to some one who
may be able to mend matters; and in the meantime, senor landlord, believe
what i have said, and take your books, and make up your mind about their
truth or falsehood, and much good may they do you; and god grant you may
not fall lame of the same foot your guest don quixote halts on."

"no fear of that," returned the landlord; "i shall not be so mad as to
make a knight-errant of myself; for i see well enough that things are not
now as they used to be in those days, when they say those famous knights
roamed about the world."

sancho had made his appearance in the middle of this conversation, and he
was very much troubled and cast down by what he heard said about
knights-errant being now no longer in vogue, and all books of chivalry
being folly and lies; a

there remained but little more of the novel to be read, when sancho panza
burst forth in wild excitement from the garret where don quixote was
lying, shouting, "run, sirs! quick; and help my master, who is in the
thick of the toughest and stiffest battle i ever laid eyes on. by the
living god he has given the giant, the enemy of my lady the princess
micomicona, such a slash that he has

 sliced his head clean off as if it
were a turnip."

"what are you talking about, brother?" said the curate, pausing as he was
about to read the remainder of the novel. "are you in your senses,
sancho? how the devil can it be as you say, when the giant is two
thousand leagues away?"

here they heard a loud noise in the chamber, and don quixote shouting
out, "stand, thief, brigand, villain; now i have got thee, and thy
scimitar shall not avail thee!" and then it seemed as though he were
slashing vigorously at the wall.

"don't stop to listen," said sancho, "but go in and part them or help my
master: though there is no need of that now, for no doubt the giant is
dead by this time and giving account to god of his past wicked life; for
i saw the blood flowing on the ground, and the head cut off and fallen on
one side, and it is

as big as a large wine-skin."

"may i die," said the landlord at this, "if don quixote or don devil has
not been slashing some of the skins of red wine that stand full at his
bed's head, and the spilt wine must be what this good fellow takes for
blood;" and so saying he went into the room and the rest after him, and
there they found don quixote in the strangest costume in the world. he
was in his shirt, which was not long enough in front to cover his thighs
completely and was six fingers shorter behind; his legs were very long
and lean, covered with hair, and anything but clean; on his head he had a
little greasy red cap that belonged to the host, round his left arm he
had rolled the blanket of the bed, to which sancho, for reasons best
known to himself, owed a grudge, and in his right hand he held his
unsheathed sword, with wh

much had his master's promises addled his wits.

the landlord was beside himself at the coolness of the squire and the
mischievous doings of the master, and swore it should not be like the
last time when they went without paying; and that their privileges of
chivalry should not hold good this time to let one or other of them off
without paying, even to the cost of the plugs that would have to be put
to the damaged wine-skins. the curate was holding don quixote's hands,
who, fancying he had now ended the adventure and was in the presence of
the princess micomicona, knelt before the curate and said, "exalted and
beauteous lady, your highness may live from this day forth fearless of
any harm this base being could do you; and i too from this day forth am
released from the promise i gave you, since by the help of god on high
and by the favour of her by whom i live and breathe, i have fulfilled it
so successfully."

"did not i say so?" said sancho

 on hearing this. "you see i wasn't drunk;
there you see my master has already salted the giant; there's no doubt
about the bulls; my county is all right!"

who could have helped laughing at the absurdities of the pair, master and
man? and laugh they did, all except the landlord, who cursed himself; but
at length the barber, cardenio, and the curate contrived with no small
trouble to get don quixote on the bed, and he fell asleep with every
appearance of excessive weariness. they left him to sleep, and came out
to the gate of the inn to console sancho panza on not having found the
head of the giant; but much more work had they to appease the landlord,
who was furious at the sudden death of his wine-skins; and said the
landlady half scolding, half crying, "at an evil moment and in an unlucky
hour he came into my house, this knight-errant--would that i had never
set eyes on him, for d

r unless
you want to hear some lie from her lips."

"i have never told a lie," was the immediate reply of her who had been
silent until now; "on the contrary, it is because i am so truthful and so
ignorant of lying devices that i am now in this miserable condition; and
this i call you yourself to witness, for it is my unstained truth that
has made you false and a liar."

cardenio heard these words clearly and distinctly, being quite close to
the speaker, for there was only the door of don quixote's room between
them, and the instant he did so, uttering a loud exclamation he cried,
"good god! what is this i hear? what voice is this that has reached my
ears?" startled at the voice the lady turned her head; and not seeing the
speaker she stood up and attempted to enter the room; observing which the
gentleman held her back, preventing her from moving a step. in her
agitation and sudden movement the silk with which she had covered her
face fell off and disclosed a countenance of incom

his good name and of his soul; and in short
everybody in the inn was full of contentment and satisfaction at the
happy issue of such a complicated and hopeless business. the curate as a
sensible man made sound reflections upon the whole affair, and
congratulated each upon his good fortune; but the one that was in the
highest spirits and good humour was the landlady, because of the promise
cardenio and the curate had given her to pay for all the losses and
damage she had sustained through don quixote's means. sancho, as has been
already said, was the only one who was distressed, unhappy, and dejected;
and so with a long face he went in to his master, who had just awoke, and
said to him:

"sir rueful countenance, your worship may as well sleep on as much as you
like, without troubling yourself about killing any giant or restoring her
kingdom to the princess; for that is all over and settled now."

"i should think it was," replied don quixote, "for i have had the most
prodigious and

h!--i
brought his head tumbling to the ground, and so much blood gushed forth
from him that it ran in rivulets over the earth like water."

"like red wine, your worship had better say," replied sancho; "for i
would have you know, if you don't know it, that the dead giant is a
hacked wine-skin, and the blood four-and-twenty gallons of red wine that
it had in its belly, and the cut-off head is the bitch that bore me; and
the devil take it all."

"what art thou talking about, fool?" said don quixote; "art thou in thy
senses?"

"let your worship get up," said sancho, "and you will see the nice
business you have made of it, and what we have to pay; and you will see
the queen turned into a private lady called dorothea, and other things
that will astonish you, if you understand them."

"i shall not be surprised at anything of the kind," returned don quixote;
"for if thou dost remember the last time we were here i told thee that
everything that happened here was a matter of enchantmen

, "if my blanketing was the
same sort of thing also; only it wasn't, but real and genuine; for i saw
the landlord, who is here to-day, holding one end of the blanket and
jerking me up to the skies very neatly and smartly, and with as much
laughter as strength; and when it comes to be a case of knowing people, i
hold for my part, simple and sinner as i am, that there is no enchantment
about it at all, but a great deal of bruising and bad luck."

"well, well, god will give a remedy," said don quixote; "hand me my
clothes and let me go out, for i want to see these transformations and
things thou speakest of."

sancho fetched him his clothes; and while he was dressing, the curate
gave don fernando and the others present an account of don quixote's
madness and of the stratagem they had made use of to withdraw him from
that pena pobre where he fancied himself stationed because of his lady's
scorn. he described to them also nearly all the adventures that sancho
had mentioned, at which t

that luscinda would act and support dorothea's part sufficiently well.

"no," said don fernando, "that must not be, for i want dorothea to follow
out this idea of hers; and if the worthy gentleman's village is not very
far off, i shall be happy if i can do anything for his relief."

"it is not more than two days' journey from this," said the curate.

"even if it were more," said don fernando, "i would gladly travel so far
for the sake of doing so good a work.

"at this moment don quixote came out in full panoply, with mambrino's
helmet, all dinted as it was, on his head, his buckler on his arm, and
leaning on his staff or pike. the strange figure he presented filled don
fernando and the rest with amazement as they contemplated his lean yellow
face half a league long, his armour of all sorts, and the solemnity of
his deportment. they stood silent waiting to see what he would say, and
he, fixing his eyes on the air dorothea, addressed her with great gravity
and composure:

accomplished things more difficult: it is no great matter to kill a whelp
of a giant, however arrogant he may be; for it is not many hours since i
myself was engaged with one, and-i will not speak of it, that they may
not say i am lying; time, however, that reveals all, will tell the tale
when we least expect it."

"you were engaged with a couple of wine-skins, and not a giant," said the
landlord at this; but don fernando told him to hold his tongue and on no
account interrupt don quixote, who continued, "i say in conclusion, high
and disinherited lady, that if your father has brought about this
metamorphosis in your person for the reason i have mentioned, you ought
not to attach any importance to it; for there is no peril on earth
through which my sword will not force a way, and with it, before many
days are over, i will bring your enemy's head to the ground and place on
yours the crown of your kingdom."

don quixote said no more, and waited for the reply of the princes

you i should never have lit upon the good fortune i now possess; and in
this i am saying what is perfectly true; as most of these gentlemen who
are present can fully testify. all that remains is to set out on our
journey to-morrow, for to-day we could not make much way; and for the
rest of the happy result i am looking forward to, i trust to god and the
valour of your heart."

so said the sprightly dorothea, and on hearing her don quixote turned to
sancho, and said to him, with an angry air, "i declare now, little
sancho, thou art the greatest little villain in spain. say, thief and
vagabond, hast thou not just now told me that this princess had been
turned into a maiden called dorothea, and that the head which i am
persuaded i cut off from a giant was the bitch that bore thee, and other
nonsense that put me in the greatest perplexity i have ever been in all
my life? i vow" (and here he looked to heaven and ground his tee

the wine-skins, and the blood being red wine, i make no mistake, as sure
as there is a god; because the wounded skins are there at the head of
your worship's bed, and the wine has made a lake of the room; if not you
will see when the eggs come to be fried; i mean when his worship the
landlord calls for all the damages: for the rest, i am heartily glad that
her ladyship the queen is as she was, for it concerns me as much as
anyone."

"i tell thee again, sancho, thou art a fool," said don quixote; "forgive
me, and that will do."

"that will do," said don fernando; "let us say no more about it; and as
her ladyship the princess proposes to set out to-morrow because it is too
late to-day, so be it, and we will pass the night in pleasant
conversation, and to-morrow we will all accompany senor don quixote; for
we wish to witness the valiant and unparalleled achievements he is about
to perform in the course of this mighty enterprise which he has
undertaken."

"it is i who shall wai

t upon and accompany you," said don quixote; "and i
am much gratified by the favour that is bestowed upon me, and the good
opinion entertained of me, which i shall strive to justify or it shall
cost me my life, or even more, if it can possibly cost me more."

many were the compliments and expressions of politeness that passed
between don quixote and don fernando; but they were brought to an end by
a traveller who at this moment entered the inn, and who seemed from his
attire to be a christian lately come from the country of the moors, for
he was dressed in a short-skirted coat of blue cloth with half-sleeves
and without a collar; his breeches were also of blue cloth, and his cap
of the same colour, and he wore yellow buskins and had a moorish cutlass
slung from a baldric across his breast. behind him, mounted upon an ass,

night was now approaching, and by the orders of those who accompanied don
fernando the landlord had taken care and pains to prepare for them the
best supper that was in his power. the hour therefore having arrived they
all took their seats at a long table like a refectory one, for round or
square table there was none in the inn, and the seat of honour at the
head of it, though he was for refusing it, they assigned to don quixote,
who desired the lady micomicona to place herself by his side, as he was
her protector. luscinda and zoraida took their places next her, opposite
to them were don fernando and cardenio, and next the captive and the
other gentlemen, and by the side of the ladies, the curate and the
barber. and so they supped in high enjoyment, which was increased when
they observed don quixote leave off eating, and, moved by an impulse like
that which made him deliver himself at such length when he supped

this peace is the true end of war; and war is only another name for arms.
this, then, being admitted, that the end of war is peace, and that so far
it has the advantage of the end of letters, let us turn to the bodily
labours of the man of letters, and those of him who follows the
profession of arms, and see which are the greater."

don quixote delivered his discourse in such a manner and in such correct
language, that for the time being he made it impossible for any of his
hearers to consider him a madman; on the contrary, as they were mostly
gentlemen, to whom arms are an appurtenance by birth, they listened to
him with great pleasure as he continued: "here, then, i say is what the
student has to undergo; first of all poverty: not that all are poor, but
to put the case as strongly as possible: and when i have said that he

continuing his discourse don quixote said: "as we began in the student's
case with poverty and its accompaniments, let us see now if the soldier
is richer, and we shall find that in poverty itself there is no one
poorer; for he is dependent on his miserable pay, which comes late or
never, or else on what he can plunder, seriously imperilling his life and
conscience; and sometimes his nakedness will be so great that a slashed
doublet serves him for unifo

detestable an age as we live in now; for though no peril can make me
fear, still it gives me some uneasiness to think that powder and lead may
rob me of the opportunity of making myself famous and renowned throughout
the known earth by the might of my arm and the edge of my sword. but
heaven's will be done; if i succeed in my attempt i shall be all the more
honoured, as i have faced greater dangers than the knights-errant of yore
exposed themselves to."

all this lengthy discourse don quixote delivered while the others supped,
forgetting to raise a morsel to his lips, though sancho more than once
told him to eat his supper, as he would have time enough afterwards to
say all he wanted. it excited fresh pity in those who had heard him to
see a man of apparently sound sense, and with rational views on every
subject he discussed, so hopelessly wanting in all, when his wretched
unlucky chivalry was in question. the curate told him he was quite right
in all he had said in favour of

 arms, and that he himself, though a man
of letters and a graduate, was of the same opinion.

they finished their supper, the cloth was removed, and while the hostess,
her daughter, and maritornes were getting don quixote of la mancha's
garret ready, in which it was arranged that the women were to be
quartered by themselves for the night, don fernando begged the captive to
tell them the story of his life, for it could not fail to be strange and
interesting, to judge by the hints he had let fall on his arrival in
company with zoraida. to this the captive replied that he would very
willingly yield to his request, only he feared his tale would not give
them as much pleasure as he wished; nevertheless, not to

with ruffled sleeves that he wore showed that he
was, as his servant said, a judge of appeal. he led by the hand a young
girl in a travelling dress, apparently about sixteen years of age, and of
such a high-bred air, so beautiful and so graceful, that all were filled
with admiration when she made her appearance, and but for having seen
dorothea, luscinda, and zoraida, who were there in the inn, they would
have fancied that a beauty like that of this maiden's would have been
hard to find. don quixote was present at the entrance of the judge with
the young lady, and as soon as he saw him he said, "your worship may with
confidence enter and take your ease in this castle; for though the
accommodation be scanty and poor, there are no quarters so cramped or
inconvenient that they cannot make room for arms and letters; above all
if arms and letters have beauty for a guide and leader, as letters
represented by your worship have in this fair maiden, to whom not only
ought castles to throw th

down to give her a reception. enter, your worship, i say, into this
paradise, for here you will find stars and suns to accompany the heaven
your worship brings with you, here you will find arms in their supreme
excellence, and beauty in its highest perfection."

the judge was struck with amazement at the language of don quixote, whom
he scrutinized very carefully, no less astonished by his figure than by
his talk; and before he could find words to answer him he had a fresh
surprise, when he saw opposite to him luscinda, dorothea, and zoraida,
who, having heard of the new guests and of the beauty of the young lady,
had come to see her and welcome her; don fernando, cardenio, and the
curate, however, greeted him in a more intelligible and polished style.
in short, the judge made his entrance in a state of bewilde

rment, as well
with what he saw as what he heard, and the fair ladies of the inn gave
the fair damsel a cordial welcome. on the whole he could perceive that
all who were there were people of quality; but with the figure,
countenance, and bearing of don quixote he was at his wits' end; and all
civilities having been exchanged, and the accommodation of the inn
inquired into, it was settled, as it had been before settled, that all
the women should retire to the garret that has been already mentioned,
and that the men should remain outside as if to guard them; the judge,
therefore, was very well pleased to allow his daughter, for such the
damsel was, to go with the ladies, which she did very willingly; and with
part of the host's narrow bed and ha

could not but join in them. the words the brothers exchanged, the emotion
they showed can scarcely be imagined, i fancy, much less put down in
writing. they told each other in a few words the events of their lives;
they showed the true affection of brothers in all its strength; then the
judge embraced zoraida, putting all he possessed at her disposal; then he
made his daughter embrace her, and the fair christian and the lovely moor
drew fresh tears from every eye. and there was don quixote observing all
these strange proceedings attentively without uttering a word, and
attributing the whole to chimeras of knight-errantry. then they agreed
that the captain and zoraida should return with his brother to seville,
and send news to his father of his having been delivered and found, so as
to enable him to come and be present at the marriage and baptism of
zoraida, for it was impossible for the judge to put off his journey, as
he was informed that in a month from that time the fle

of his extraordinary humour, with which he was not a little amused.
sancho panza alone was fuming at the lateness of the hour for retiring to
rest; and he of all was the one that made himself most comfortable, as he
stretched himself on the trappings of his ass, which, as will be told
farther on, cost him so dear.

the ladies, then, having retired to their chamber, and the others having
disposed themselves with as little discomfort as they could, don quixote
sallied out of the inn to act as sentinel of the castle as he had
promised. it happened, however, that a little before the approach of dawn
a voice so musical and sweet reached the ears of the ladies that it
forced them all to listen attentively, but especially dorothea, who had
been awake, and by whose side dona clara de viedma, for so the judge's
daughter was called, lay sleeping. no one could imagine who it was that
sang so sweetly, and the voice was unaccompanied by any instrument. a

dorothea could not help laughing to hear how like a child dona clara
spoke. "let us go to sleep now, senora," said she, "for the little of the
night that i fancy is left to us: god will soon send us daylight, and we
will set all to rights, or it will go hard with me."

with this they fell asleep, and deep silence reigned all through the inn.
the only persons not asleep were the landlady's daughter and her servant
maritornes, who, knowing the weak point of don quixote's humour, and that
he was outside the inn mounting guard in armour and on horseback,
resolved, the pair of them, to play some trick upon him, or at any rate
to amuse themselves for a while by listening to his nonsense. as it so
happened there was not a window in the whole inn that looked outwards
except a hole in the wall of a straw-loft through which they used to
throw out the straw. at this hole the two demi-damsels posted themselves,
and observed don quixote on his horse, leaning on h

 steeds in haste to rise
betimes and come forth to see my lady; when thou seest her i entreat of
thee to salute her on my behalf: but have a care, when thou shalt see her
and salute her, that thou kiss not her face; for i shall be more jealous
of thee than thou wert of that light-footed ingrate that made thee sweat
and run so on the plains of thessaly, or on the banks of the peneus (for
i do not exactly recollect where it was thou didst run on that occasion)
in thy jealousy and love."

don quixote had got so far in his pathetic speech when the landlady's
daughter began to signal to him, saying, "senor, come over here, please."

at these signals and voice don quixote turned his head and saw by the
light of the moon, which then was in its full splendour, that some one
was calling to him from the hole in the wall, which seemed to him to be a
window, and what is more, with a gilt grating, as rich castles, such as
he believed the inn to be, ought to have; and it immediately suggested

"my mistress wants nothing of that sort, sir knight," said maritornes at
this.

"what then, discreet dame, is it that your mistress wants?" replied don
quixote.

"only one of your fair hands," said maritornes, "to enable her to vent
over it the great passion which has brought her to this loophole,
so much to the risk of her honour; for if the lord her father had heard
her, the least slice he would cut off her would be her ear."

"i should like to see that tried," said don quixote; "but he had better
beware of that, if he does not want to meet the most disastrous end that
ever father in the world met for having laid hands on the tender limbs of
a love-stricken daughter."

maritornes felt sure that don quixote would present the hand she had
asked, and making up her mind what to do, she got down from the hole and
went into the stable, where she took the halter of sancho panza's ass,
and in all haste returned to the hole, just as don quixote had planted
himself sta

may observe the contexture of the sinews, the close network of the

"that we shall see presently," said maritornes, and making a running knot
on the halter, she passed it over his wrist and coming down from the hole
tied the other end very firmly to the bolt of the door of the straw-loft.

don quixote, feeling the roughness of the rope on his wrist, exclaimed,
"your grace seems to be grating rather than caressing my hand; treat it
not so harshly, for it is not to blame for the offence my resolution has
given you, nor is it just to wreak all your vengeance on so small a part;
remember that one who loves so well should not revenge herself so
cruelly."

but there was nobody now to listen to these words of don quixote's, for

but he was very much deceived in this conclusion, for daylight had hardly
begun to appear when there came up to the inn four men on horseback, well
equipped and accoutred, with firelocks across their saddle-bows. they
called out and knocked loudly at the gate of the inn, which was still
shut; on seeing which, don quixote, even there where he was, did not
forget to act as sentinel, and said in a loud and imperious tone,
"knights, or squires, or whatever ye be, ye have no right to knock at the
gates of this castle; for it is plain enough that they who are within are
either asleep, or else are not in the habit of throwing open the fortress
until the sun's rays are spread over the whole surface of the earth.

"what the devil fortress or castle is this," said one, "to make us stand
on such ceremony? if you are the innkeeper bid them open to us; we are
travellers who only want to feed our horses and go on, for we are in
haste."

"do you think, gentlemen, that i look like an innkeeper?" said don
quixote.

"i don't know what you look like," replied the other; "but i know that
you are talking nonsense when you call this inn a castle."

"a castle it is," returned don quixote, "nay, more, one of the best in
this whole province, and it has within it people who have had the sceptre
in the hand and the crown on the head."

"it would be better if it were the other way," said the traveller, "the
sceptre on the head and the crown in the hand; but if so, may be there is
within some company of players, with whom it is a common thing to have
those crowns and sceptres you speak of; for in such a small inn as this,
and where such silence is kept, i do not believe any p

crowns and sceptres can have taken up their quarters."

"you know but little of the world," returned don quixote, "since you are
ignorant of what commonly occurs in knight-errantry."

but the comrades of the spokesman, growing weary of the dialogue with don
quixote, renewed their knocks with great vehemence, so much so that the
host, and not only he but everybody in the inn, awoke, and he got up to
ask who knocked. it happened at this moment that one of the horses of the
four who were seeking admittance went to smell rocinante, who melancholy,
dejected, and with drooping ears stood motionless, sup

stretched master; and as he was, after all, flesh, though he looked as if
he were made of wood, he could not help giving way and in return smelling
the one who had come to offer him attentions. but he had hardly moved at
all when don quixote lost his footing; and slipping off the saddle, he
would have come to the ground, but for being suspended by the arm, which
caused him such agony that he believed either his wrist would be cut
through or his arm torn off; and he hung so near the ground that he could
just touch it with his feet, which was all the worse for him; for,
finding how little was wanted to enable him to plant his feet firmly, he
struggled and stretched himself as much as he could to gain a footing;

in which are continued the unheard-of adventures of the inn


so loud, in fact, were the shouts of don quixote, that the landlord
opening the gate of the inn in all haste, came out in dismay, and ran to
see who was uttering such cries, and those who were outside joined him.
maritornes, who had been by this time roused up by the same outcry,
suspecting what it was, ran to the loft and, without anyone seeing her,
untied the halter by which don quixote was suspended, and down he came to
the ground in the sight of the landlord and the travellers, who
approaching asked him what was the matter with him

replying a word took the rope off his wrist, and rising to his
feet leaped upon rocinante, braced his buckler on his arm, put his lance
in rest, and making a considerable circuit of the plain came back at a
half-gallop exclaiming:

"whoever shall say that i have been enchanted with just cause, provided
my lady the princess micomicona grants me permission to do so, i give him
the lie, challenge him and defy him to single combat."

the newly arrived travellers were amazed at the words of don quixote; but
the landlord removed their surprise by telling them who he was, and not
to mind him as he was out of his senses. they then asked the landlord if
by any chance a youth of about fifteen years of age had come to that inn,
one dressed like a muleteer, and of such and such an appearance,
describing that of dona clara's lover. the landlord replied that there
were so many people in the inn he had not noticed the person they were
inquiring for; but one of them observing the coach in which t

und the inn, lest he
should escape over the wall of the yard." "so be it," said another; and
while two of them went in, one remained at the gate and the other made
the circuit of the inn; observing all which, the landlord was unable to
conjecture for what reason they were taking all these precautions, though
he understood they were looking for the youth whose description they had
given him.

it was by this time broad daylight; and for that reason, as well as in
consequence of the noise don quixote had made, everybody was awake and
up, but particularly dona clara and dorothea; for they had been able to
sleep but badly that night, the one from agitation at having her lover so
near her, the other from curiosity to see him. don quixote, when he saw
that not one of the four travellers took any notice of him or replied to
his challenge, was furious and ready to die with indignation and wrath;
and if he could have found in the ordinances of chivalry that it was
lawful for a knight-errant

ch his life, honour, and heart were
at stake. the servants pressed him, saying that most certainly they would
not return without him, and that they would take him away whether he
liked it or not.

"you shall not do that," replied don luis, "unless you take me dead;
though however you take me, it will be without life."

by this time most of those in the inn had been attracted by the dispute,
but particularly cardenio, don fernando, his companions, the judge, the
curate, the barber, and don quixote; for he now considered there was no
necessity for mounting guard over the castle any longer. cardenio being
already acquainted with the young man's story, asked the men who wanted
to take him away, what object they had in seeking to carry off this youth
against his will.

"our object," said one of the four, "is to save the life of his father,
who is in danger of losing it through this gentleman's disappearance."

upon this don luis exclaimed, "there is no need to make my affairs public

t of the gate and demanded his reckoning,
abusing them for their dishonesty with such language that he drove them
to reply with their fists, and so they began to lay on him in such a
style that the poor man was forced to cry out, and call for help. the
landlady and her daughter could see no one more free to give aid than don
quixote, and to him the daughter said, "sir knight, by the virtue god has
given you, help my poor father, for two wicked men are beating him to a
mummy."

to which don quixote very deliberately and phlegmatically replied, "fair
damsel, at the present moment your request is inopportune, for i am
debarred from involving myself in any adventure until i have brought to a
happy conclusion one to which my word has pledged me; but that which i
can do for you is what i will now mention: run and tell your father to
stand his ground as well as he can in this battle, and on no account to
allow himself to be vanquished, while i go and request permission of the
princess mi

comicona to enable me to succour him in his distress; and if
she grants it, rest assured i will relieve him from it."

"sinner that i am," exclaimed maritornes, who stood by; "before you have
got your permission my master will be in the other world."

"give me leave, senora, to obtain the permission i speak of," returned
don quixote; "and if i get it, it will matter very little if he is in the
other world; for i will rescue him thence in spite of all the same world
can do; or at any rate i will give you such a revenge over those who
shall have sent him there that you will be more than moderately
satisfied;" and without saying anything more he went and knelt before
dorothea, requesting her highness in knightly and errant phrase to be
pleased to grant him permission to aid and succour the castellan of that
castle, who

 now stood in grievous jeopardy. the princess granted it
graciously, and he at once, bracing his buckler on his arm and drawing
his sword, hastened to the inn-gate, where the two guests were still
handling the landlord roughly; but as soon as he reached the spot he
stopped short and stood still, though maritornes and the landlady asked
him why he hesitated to help their master and husband.

"i hesitate," said don quixote, "because it is not lawful for me to draw
sword against persons of squirely condition; but call my squire sancho to
me; for this defence and vengeance are his affair and business."

thus matters stood at the inn-gate, where there was a very lively
exchange of fisticuffs and punches, to the sore damage of the landlord
and to the wrath of maritornes, the landlady, and her daughter, who were
furious when they saw the pusillanimity of don quixote, and the hard
treatment their master, husban

ssed his hands by force, nay, bathed them with his tears, in a way
that would have touched a heart of marble, not to say that of the judge,
who, as a shrewd man, had already perceived how advantageous the marriage
would be to his daughter; though, were it possible, he would have
preferred that it should be brought about with the consent of the father
of don luis, who he knew looked for a title for his son.

the guests had by this time made peace with the landlord, for, by
persuasion and don quixote's fair words more than by threats, they had
paid him what he demanded, and the servants of don luis were waiting for
the end of the conversation with the judge and their master's decision,
when the devil, who never sleeps, contrived that the barber, from whom
don quixote had taken mambrino's helmet, and sancho panza the trappings
of his ass in exchange for those of his own, should at this instant enter
the inn; which said barber, as he led his ass to the stable, observed

gave the barber a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood. the barber,
however, was not so ready to relinquish the prize he had made in the
pack-saddle; on the contrary, he raised such an outcry that everyone in
the inn came running to know what the noise and quarrel meant. "here, in
the name of the king and justice!" he cried, "this thief and highwayman
wants to kill me for trying to recover my property."

"you lie," said sancho, "i am no highwayman; it was in fair war my master
don quixote won these spoils."

don quixote was standing by at the time, highly pleased to see his
squire's stoutness, both offensive and defensive, and from that time
forth he reckoned him a man of mettle, and in his heart resolved to dub
him a knight on the first opportunity that presented itself, feeling sure
that the order of chivalry would be fittingly bestowed upon him.

in the course of the altercation, among other things the barber said,
"gentlemen, this pack-saddle is mine as surely as i

owe god a death, and
i know it as well as if i had given birth to it, and here is my ass in
the stable who will not let me lie; only try it, and if it does not fit
him like a glove, call me a rascal; and what is more, the same day i was
robbed of this, they robbed me likewise of a new brass basin, never yet
handselled, that would fetch a crown any day."

at this don quixote could not keep himself from answering; and
interposing between the two, and separating them, he placed the
pack-saddle on the ground, to lie there in sight until the truth was
established, and said, "your worships may perceive clearly and plainly
the error under which this worthy squire lies when he calls a basin which
was, is, and shall be the helmet of mambrino which i won from him in fair
war, and made myself master of by legitimate and lawful possession. with

such transformations will take place in adventures of chivalry. to
confirm all which, run, sancho my son, and fetch hither the helmet which
this good fellow calls a basin."

"egad, master," said sancho, "if we have no other proof of our case than
what your worship puts forward, mambrino's helmet is just as much a basin
as this good fellow's caparison is a pack-saddle."

"do as i bid thee," said don quixote; "it cannot be that everything in
this castle goes by enchantment."

sancho hastened to where the basin was, and brought it back with him, and
when don quixote saw it, he took hold of it and said:

"your worships may see with what a face this squire can assert that this
is a basin and not the helmet i told you of; and i swear by the order of
chivalry i profess, that this helmet is the identical one i took from
him, without anything added to or taken from it."

"there is no doubt of t

chapter xlv.

in which the doubtful question of mambrino's helmet and the pack-saddle
is finally settled, with other adventures that occurred in truth and
earnest


"what do you think now, gentlemen," said the barber, "of what these
gentles say, when they want to make out that this is a helmet?"

"and whoever says the contrary," said don quixote, "i will let him know
he lies if he is a knight, and if he is a squire that he lies again a
thousand times."

our own barber, who was present at all this, and understood don quixote's
humour so thoroughly, took it into his head to back up his delusion and
carry on the joke for the general amusement; so addressing the other
barber he said:

"senor barber, or whatever you are, you must know that i belong to your
profession too, and have had a licence to practise for more than twenty

to soldiers' arms; and i say-saving better opinions and always with
submission to sounder judgments--that this piece we have now before us,
which this worthy gentleman has in his hands, not only is no barber's
basin, but is as far from being one as white is from black, and truth
from falsehood; i say, moreover, that this, although it is a helmet, is
not a complete helmet."

"certainly not," said don quixote, "for half of it is wanting, that is to
say the beaver."

"it is quite true," said the curate, who saw the object of his friend the
barber; and cardenio, don fernando and his companions agreed with him,
and even the judge, if his thoughts had not been so full of don luis's
affair, would have helped to carry on the joke; but he was so taken up
with the serious matters he had on his mind that he paid little or no
attention to these facetious proceedings.

"god bless me!" exclaimed their

 butt the barber at this; "is it possible
that such an honourable company can say that this is not a basin but a
helmet? why, this is a thing that would astonish a whole university,
however wise it might be! that will do; if this basin is a helmet, why,
then the pack-saddle must be a horse's caparison, as this gentleman has
said."

"to me it looks like a pack-saddle," said don quixote; "but i have
already said that with that question i do not concern myself."

"as to whether it be pack-saddle or caparison," said the curate, "it is
only for senor don quixote to say; for in these matters of chivalry all
these gentlemen and i bow to his authority."

"by god, gentlemen," said don quixote, "so many strange things have
happened to me in this castle on the two occasions on which i have
sojourned in it, that i will not venture to assert anything positively in
reply to any

swer; but as to the question whether this is a
pack-saddle or a caparison i will not venture to give a positive opinion,
but will leave it to your worships' better judgment. perhaps as you are
not dubbed knights like myself, the enchantments of this place have
nothing to do with you, and your faculties are unfettered, and you can
see things in this castle as they really and truly are, and not as they
appear to me."

"there can be no question," said don fernando on this, "but that senor
don quixote has spoken very wisely, and that with us rests the decision
of this matter; and that we may have surer ground to go on, i will take
the votes of the gentlemen in secret, and declare the result clearly and
fully."

to those who were in the secret of don quixote's humour all this afforded
great amusement; but to those who knew nothing about it, it seemed the
greatest nonsense in the world, in particular to the four servants of don
luis, as well as to don luis himself, and to three other t

n spite of
you and your ass, this is a caparison and no pack-saddle, and you have

"may i never share heaven," said the poor barber, "if your worships are
not all mistaken; and may my soul appear before god as that appears to me
a pack-saddle and not a caparison; but, 'laws go,'-i say no more; and
indeed i am not drunk, for i am fasting, except it be from sin."

the simple talk of the barber did not afford less amusement than the
absurdities of don quixote, who now observed:

"there is no more to be done now than for each to take what belongs to
him, and to whom god has given it, may st. peter add his blessing."

but said one of the four servants, "unless, indeed, this is a deliberate
joke, i cannot bring myself to believe that men so intelligent as those
present are, or seem to be, can venture to declare and assert that this
is not a basin, and that not a pack-saddle; but as i perceive that they
do assert and declare it, i can only come

"it is all the same," said the servant; "that is not the point; but
whether it is or is not a pack-saddle, as your worships say."

on hearing this one of the newly arrived officers of the brotherhood, who
had been listening to the dispute and controversy, unable to restrain his
anger and impatience, exclaimed, "it is a pack-saddle as sure as my
father is my father, and whoever has said or will say anything else must
be drunk."

"you lie like a rascally clown," returned don quixote; and lifting his
pike, which he had never let out of his hand, he delivered such a blow at
his head that, had not the officer dodged it, it would have stretched him
at full length. the pike was shivered in pieces against the ground, and
the rest of the officers, seeing their comrade assaulted, raised a shout,
calling for help for the holy brotherhood. the landlord, who was of the
fraternity, ran at once to fetch his staff of office and his sword, and

clustered round him, lest he should escape from them in the confusion;
the barber, seeing the house turned upside down, once more laid hold of
his pack-saddle and sancho did the same; don quixote drew his sword and
charged the officers; don luis cried out to his servants to leave him
alone and go and help don quixote, and cardenio and don fernando, who
were supporting him; the curate was shouting at the top of his voice, the
landlady was screaming, her daughter was wailing, maritornes was weeping,
dorothea was aghast, luscinda terror-stricken, and dona clara in a faint.

him from escaping, a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood; the judge took

ndo had got one of the officers down and was
belabouring him heartily; the landlord raised his voice again calling for
help for the holy brotherhood; so that the whole inn was nothing but
cries, shouts, shrieks, confusion, terror, dismay, mishaps, sword-cuts,
fisticuffs, cudgellings, kicks, and bloodshed; and in the midst of all
this chaos, complication, and general entanglement, don quixote took it
into his head that he had been plunged into the thick of the discord of
agramante's camp; and, in a voice that shook the inn like thunder, he
cried out:

"hold all, let all sheathe their swords, let all be calm and attend to me
as they value their lives!"

all paused at his mighty voice, and he went on to say, "did i not tell
you, sirs, that this castle was enchanted, and that a legion or so of
devils dwelt in it? in proof whereof i call upon you to behold with your

 the midst of us. see how they fight, there for the
sword, here for the horse, on that side for the eagle, on this for the
helmet; we are all fighting, and all at cross purposes. come then, you,
senor judge, and you, senor curate; let the one represent king agramante
and the other king sobrino, and make peace among us; for by god almighty
it is a sorry business that so many persons of quality as we are should
slay one another for such trifling cause." the officers, who did not
understand don quixote's mode of speaking, and found themselves roughly
handled by don fernando, cardenio, and their companions, were not to be
appeased; the barber was, however, for both his beard and his pack-saddle
were the worse for the struggle; sancho like a good servant obeyed the
slightest word of his master; while the four servants of don luis kept
quiet when they saw how little they gained by not being so. the landlord
alone insisted upon it that they must punish the insolence of this
madman, who at

every turn raised a disturbance in the inn; but at length
the uproar was stilled for the present; the pack-saddle remained a
caparison till the day of judgment, and the basin a helmet and the inn a
castle in don quixote's imagination.

all having been now pacified and made friends by the persuasion of the
judge and the curate, the servants of don luis began again to urge him to
return with them at once; and while he was discussing the matter with
them, the judge took counsel with don fernando, cardenio, and the curate
as to what he ought to do in the case, telling them how it stood, and
what don luis had said to him. it was agreed at length that don fernando
should tell the servants of don luis who he

ing that whatever the result might be they were likely
to get the worst of the battle; but one of them, the one who had been
thrashed and kicked by don fernando, recollected that among some warrants
he carried for the arrest of certain delinquents, he had one against don
quixote, whom the holy brotherhood had ordered to be arrested for setting
the galley slaves free, as sancho had, with very good reason,
apprehended. suspecting how it was, then, he wished to satisfy himself as
to whether don quixote's features corresponded; and taking a parchment
out of his bosom he lit upon what he was in search of, and setting
himself to read it deliberately, for he was not a quick reader, as he
made out each word he fixed his eyes on don quixote, and went on
comparing the description in the warrant with his face, and discovered
that beyond all doubt he was the person described in it. as soon as he
had satisfied himself, folding up the parchment, he took the warrant in
his left hand and with his r

ight seized don quixote by the collar so
tightly that he did not allow him to breathe, and shouted aloud, "help
for the holy brotherhood! and that you may see i demand it in earnest,
read this warrant which says this highwayman is to be arrested."

the curate took the warrant and saw that what the officer said was true,
and that it agreed with don quixote's appearance, who, on his part, when
he found himself roughly handled by this rascally clown, worked up to the
highest pitch of wrath, and all his joints cracking with rage, with both
hands seized the officer by the throat with all his might, so that had he
not been helped by his comrades he would have yielded up his life ere don
quixote released his hold. the landlord, who had perforce to support his
brother officers, ran at once to aid them. the landlady, when she saw her
husband engag

ed in a fresh quarrel, lifted up her voice afresh, and its
note was immediately caught up by maritornes and her daughter, calling
upon heaven and all present for help; and sancho, seeing what was going
on, exclaimed, "by the lord, it is quite true what my master says about
the enchantments of this castle, for it is impossible to live an hour in
peace in it!"

don fernando parted the officer and don quixote, and to their mutual
contentment made them relax the grip by which they held, the one the coat
collar, the other the throat of his adversary; for all this, however, the
officers did not cease to demand their prisoner and call on them to help,
and deliver him over bound into their power, as was required for the
service of the king and of the holy brotherhood, on whose behalf they
again demanded aid and assistance to effect the capture of this robber
and footpad of the highways.

of the end of the notable adventure of the officers of the holy
brotherhood; and of the great ferocity of our worthy knight, don quixote


while don quixote was talking in this strain, the curate was endeavouring
to persuade the officers that he was out of his senses, as they might
perceive by his deeds and his words, and that they need not press the
matter any further, for even if they arrested him and carried him off,
they would have to release him by-and-by as a madman; to which the holder
of the warrant replied that he had nothing to do with inquiring into don
quixote's madness, but only to execute his superior's or

ders, and that
once taken they might let him go three hundred times if they liked.

"for all that," said the curate, "you must not take him away this time,
nor will he, it is my opinion, let himself be taken away."

in short, the curate used such arguments, and don quixote did such mad
things, that the officers would have been more mad than he was if they
had not perceived his want of wits, and so they thought it best to allow
themselves to be pacified, and even to act as peacemakers between the
barber and sancho panza, who still continued their altercation with much
bitterness. in the end they, as officers of justice, settled the question
by arbitration in such a manner that both sides were, if not perfectly
contented, at least to some extent satisfied; f

or they changed the
pack-saddles, but not the girths or head-stalls; and as to mambrino's
helmet, the curate, under the rose and without don quixote's knowing it,
paid eight reals for the basin, and the barber executed a full receipt
and engagement to make no further demand then or thenceforth for
evermore, amen. these two disputes, which were the most important and
gravest, being settled, it only remained for the servants of don luis to
consent that three of them should return while one was left to accompany
him whither don fernando desired to take him; and good luck and better
fortune, having already begun to solve difficulties and

studied the various countenances, but particularly her spaniard's, whom
she followed with her eyes and clung to with her soul. the gift and
compensation which the curate gave the barber had not escaped the
landlord's notice, and he demanded don quixote's reckoning, together with
the amount of the damage to his wine-skins, and the loss of his wine,
swearing that neither rocinante nor sancho's ass should leave the inn
until he had been paid to the very last farthing. the curate settled all
amicably, and don fernando paid; though the judge had also very readily
offered to pay the score; and all became so peaceful and quiet that the
inn no longer reminded one of the discord of agramante's camp, as don
quixote said, but of the peace and tra

were due to the great zeal and eloquence of the curate, and to the
unexampled generosity of don fernando.

finding himself now clear and quit of all quarrels, his squire's as well
as his own, don quixote considered that it would be advisable to continue
the journey he had begun, and bring to a close that great adventure for
which he had been called and chosen; and with this high resolve he went
and knelt before dorothea, who, however, would not allow him to utter a
word until he had risen; so to obey her he rose, and said, "it is a
common proverb, fair lady, that 'diligence is the mother of good
fortune,' and experience has often shown in important affairs that the
earnestness of the neg

may seize it to fortify himself in some impregnable castle or stronghold,
against which all my efforts and the might of my indefatigable arm may
avail but little? therefore, lady, let us, as i say, forestall his
schemes by our activity, and let us depart at once in quest of fair
fortune; for your highness is only kept from enjoying it as fully as you
could desire by my delay in encountering your adversary."

don quixote held his peace and said no more, calmly awaiting the reply of
the beauteous princess, who, with commanding dignity and in a style
adapted to don quixote's own, replied to him in these words, "i give you
thanks, sir knight, for the eagerness you, like a good knight to whom it
is a natural obligation to succour the orphan and the needy, display to
afford me aid in my sore trouble; and heaven grant that your wishes and
mine may be realised, so that you may see that there are women in this

i have no will but yours; dispose of me entirely in accordance with your
good pleasure; for she who has once entrusted to you the defence of her
person, and placed in your hands the recovery of her dominions, must not
think of offering opposition to that which your wisdom may ordain."

"on, then, in god's name," said don quixote; "for, when a lady humbles
herself to me, i will not lose the opportunity of raising her up and
placing her on the throne of her ancestors. let us depart at once, for
the common saying that in delay there is danger, lends spurs to my
eagerness to take the road; and as neither heaven has created nor hell
seen any that can daunt or intimidate me, saddle rocinante, sancho, and
get ready thy ass and the queen's palfrey, and let us take leave of the
castellan and these gentlemen, and go hence

 this very instant."

sancho, who was standing by all the time, said, shaking his head, "ah!
master, master, there is more mischief in the village than one hears of,
begging all good bodies' pardon."

"what mischief can there be in any village, or in all the cities of the
world, you booby, that can hurt my reputation?" said don quixote.

"if your worship is angry," replied sancho, "i will hold my tongue and
leave unsaid what as a good squire i am bound to say, and what a good
servant should tell his master."

"say what thou wilt," returned don quixote, "provided thy words be not
meant to work upon my fears; for thou, if thou fearest, art behaving like
thyself; but i like myself, in not fearing."

"it is nothing of the sort, as i am a sinner before god," said sancho,
"but that i take it to be sure and certain that t

wed him to proceed, and he continued, "this i say, senor,
because, if after we have travelled roads and highways, and passed bad
nights and worse days, one who is now enjoying himself in this inn is to
reap the fruit of our labours, there is no need for me to be in a hurry
to saddle rocinante, put the pad on the ass, or get ready the palfrey;
for it will be better for us to stay quiet, and let every jade mind her
spinning, and let us go to dinner."

good god, what was the indignation of don quixote when he heard the
audacious words of his squire! so great was it, that in a voice
inarticulate with rage, with a stammering tongue, and eyes that flashed
living fire, he exclaimed, "rascally clown, boorish, insolent, and
ignorant, ill-spoken, foul-mouthed, impudent backbiter and slanderer!

illustrious ladies? hast thou dared to harbour such gross and shameless
thoughts in thy muddled imagination? begone from my prese

haps he did not utter them without cause, and from
his good sense and christian conscience it is not likely that he would
bear false witness against anyone. we may therefore believe, without any
hesitation, that since, as you say, sir knight, everything in this castle
goes and is brought about by means of enchantment, sancho, i say, may
possibly have seen, through this diabolical medium, what he says he saw
so much to the detriment of my modesty."

"i swear by god omnipotent," exclaimed don quixote at this, "your
highness has hit the point; and that some vile illusion must have come
before this sinner of a sancho, that made him see what it would have been
impossible to see by any other means than enchantments; for i know well
enough, from the poor fellow's goodness and harmlessness, that he is
incapable of bearing false witness against anybody."

"true, no doubt," said don fernando, "for which reason, senor don
quixote, you ought to forgive him and restore him to the bosom of your

favour, sicut erat in principio, before illusions of this sort had taken
away his senses."

don quixote said he was ready to pardon him, and the curate went for
sancho, who came in very humbly, and falling on his knees begged for the
hand of his master, who having presented it to him and allowed him to
kiss it, gave him his blessing and said, "now, sancho my son, thou wilt
be convinced of the truth of what i have many a time told thee, that
everything in this castle is done by means of enchantment."

"so it is, i believe," said sancho, "except the affair of the blanket,

"believe it not," said don quixote, "for had it been so, i would have
avenged thee that instant, or even now; but neither then nor now could i,
nor have i seen anyone upon whom to avenge thy wrong."

they were all eager to know what the affair of the blanket was, and the
landlord gave them a minute account of sancho's flights, at which they
laughed not a little, and at which sancho would have been no less out of
countenance had not his master once more assured him it was all
enchantment. for all that his simplicity never

heir plan they arranged with the owner of an oxcart who
happened to be passing that way to carry him after this fashion. they
constructed a kind of cage with wooden bars, large enough to hold don
quixote comfortably; and then don fernando and his companions, the
servants of don luis, and the officers of the brotherhood, together with
the landlord, by the directions and advice of the curate, covered their
faces and disguised themselves, some in one way, some in another, so as
to appear to don quixote quite different from the persons he had seen in
the castle. this done, in profound silence they entered the room where he
was asleep, taking his rest after the past frays, and advancing to
where he was sleeping tranquilly, not dreaming of anything of the kind
happening, they seized him firmly and bound him fast hand and foot, so
that, when he awoke startled, he was unable to move, and could only
marvel and wonder at the strange figures he saw before him; upon which he
at once gave way to

is expedient that thou shouldst go to the destination assigned to both of

close he raised his voice to a high pitch, and then lowered it to such a
soft tone, that even those who knew it was all a joke were almost
inclined to take what they heard seriously.

don quixote was comforted by the prophecy he heard, for he at once
comprehended its meaning perfectly, and perceived it was promised to him
that he should see himself united in holy and lawful matrimony with his
beloved dulcinea del toboso, from whose blessed womb should proceed the
whelps, his sons, to the eternal glory of la mancha; and being thoroughly
and firmly persuaded of this, he lifted up his voice, and with a deep
sigh exclaimed, "oh thou, whoever thou art, who hast foretold me so much

will, which is already made, i have declared the sum that shall be paid

sancho bowed his head very respectfully and kissed both his hands, for,
being tied together, he could not kiss one; and then the apparitions
lifted the cage upon their shoulders and fixed it upon the ox-cart.

forgotten calling of knight-adventurers, they may have newly invented

"i don't know what to think," answered sancho, "not being as well read as
your worship in errant writings; but for all that i venture to say and
swear that these apparitions that are about us are not quite catholic."

"catholic!" said don quixote. "father of me! how can they be catholic
when they are all devils that have taken fantastic shapes to come and do
this, and bring me to this condition? and if thou wouldst prove it, touch
them, and feel them, and thou wilt find they have only bodies of air, and
no consistency except in appearance."

"by god, master," returned sancho, "i have touched them already; and that
devil, that goes about there so busily, has firm flesh, and another
property very different from what i have heard s

all accounts they all smell of brimstone and other bad smells; but this
one smells of amber half a league off." sancho was here speaking of don
fernando, who, like a gentleman of his rank, was very likely perfumed as
sancho said.

"marvel not at that, sancho my friend," said don quixote; "for let me
tell thee devils are crafty; and even if they do carry odours about with
them, they themselves have no smell, because they are spirits; or, if
they have any smell, they cannot smell of anything sweet, but of
something foul and fetid; and the reason is that as they carry hell with
them wherever they go, and can get no ease whatever from their torments,
and as a sweet smell is a thing that gives pleasure and enjoyment, it is
impossible that they can smell sweet; if, then, this

time the curate had made an
arrangement with the officers that they should bear them company as far
as his village, he paying them so much a day. cardenio hung the buckler
on one side of the bow of rocinante's saddle and the basin on the other,
and by signs commanded sancho to mount his ass and take rocinante's
bridle, and at each side of the cart he placed two officers with their
muskets; but before the cart was put in motion, out came the landlady and
her daughter and maritornes to bid don quixote farewell, pretending to
weep with grief at his misfortune; and to them don quixote said:

"weep not, good ladies, for all these mishaps are the lot of those who
follow the profession i profess; and if these reverses did not befall me
i should not esteem myself a famous knight-errant; for such things never
happen to knights of little renown and fame, because nobody in the world
thinks about them; to valiant knights they do, for these are envied for
their virtue and valour by many princes

s, if, through inadvertence, i have in aught offended you;
for intentionally and wittingly i have never done so to any; and pray to
god that he deliver me from this captivity to which some malevolent
enchanter has consigned me; and should i find myself released therefrom,
the favours that ye have bestowed upon me in this castle shall be held in
memory by me, that i may acknowledge, recognise, and requite them as they
deserve."

while this was passing between the ladies of the castle and don quixote,
the curate and the barber bade farewell to don fernando and his
companions, to the captain, his brother, and the ladies, now all made
happy, and in particular to dorothea and luscinda. they all embraced one
another, and promised to let each other know how things went with them,
and don fernando directed the curate where to write to him, to tell him
what became of don quixote, assuring him that there was nothing that
could give him more pleasure than to hear of it, and that he too, on hi

nt them himself. the curate thanked him, and
opening them he saw at the beginning of the manuscript the words, "novel
of rinconete and cortadillo," by which he perceived that it was a novel,
and as that of "the ill-advised curiosity" had been good he concluded
this would be so too, as they were both probably by the same author; so
he kept it, intending to read it when he had an opportunity. he then
mounted and his friend the barber did the same, both masked, so as not to
be recognised by don quixote, and set out following in the rear of the
cart. the order of march was this: first went the cart with the owner
leading it; at each side of it marched the officers of the brotherhood,
as has been said, with their muskets; then followed sancho panza on his
ass, leading rocinante by the bridle; and behind all came the curate and
the barber on their mighty mules, with faces covered, as aforesaid, and a
grave and serious air, measuring their pace to suit the slow steps of the
oxen. don quixo

oxen, but like men who rode canons' mules, and in haste to take their
noontide rest as soon as possible at the inn which was in sight not a
league off. the quick travellers came up with the slow, and courteous
salutations were exchanged; and one of the new comers, who was, in fact,
a canon of toledo and master of the others who accompanied him, observing
the regular order of the procession, the cart, the officers, sancho,
rocinante, the curate and the barber, and above all don quixote caged and
confined, could not help asking what was the meaning of carrying the man
in that fashion; though, from the badges of the officers, he already
concluded that he must be some desperate highwayman or other malefactor
whose punishment fell within the jurisdiction of the holy brotherhood.
one of the officers to whom he had put the question, replied, "let the
gentleman himself tell you the meaning of his going this way, senor, for
we do not know."

ation and said, "haply, gentlemen, you
are versed and learned in matters of errant chivalry? because if you are
i will tell you my misfortunes; if not, there is no good in my giving
myself the trouble of relating them;" but here the curate and the barber,
seeing that the travellers were engaged in conversation with don quixote,
came forward, in order to answer in such a way as to save their stratagem
from being discovered.

the canon, replying to don quixote, said, "in truth, brother, i know more
about books of chivalry than i do about villalpando's elements of logic;
so if that be all, you may safely tell me what you please."

"in god's name, then, senor," replied don quixote; "if that be so, i
would have you know that i am held enchanted in this cage by the envy and
fraud of wicked enchanters; for virtue is more persecuted by the wicked
than loved by the good. i am a knight-errant, and not one of those whose

persia, or brahmans that india, or gymnosophists that ethiopia ever
produced, will place their names in the temple of immortality, to serve
as examples and patterns for ages to come, whereby knights-errant may see
the footsteps in which they must tread if they would attain the summit
and crowning point of honour in arms."

"what senor don quixote of la mancha says," observed the curate, "is the
truth; for he goes enchanted in this cart, not from any fault or sins of
his, but because of the malevolence of those to whom virtue is odious and
valour hateful. this, senor, is the knight of the rueful countenance, if
you have ever heard him named, whose valiant achievements and mighty
deeds shall be written on lasting brass and imperishable marble,
notwithstanding all the efforts of envy to obscure them and malice to
hide them."

when

 the canon heard both the prisoner and the man who was at liberty
talk in such a strain he was ready to cross himself in his astonishment,
and could not make out what had befallen him; and all his attendants were
in the same state of amazement.

at this point sancho panza, who had drawn near to hear the conversation,
said, in order to make everything plain, "well, sirs, you may like or
dislike what i am going to say, but the fact of the matter is, my master,
don quixote, is just as much enchanted as my mother. he is in his full
senses, he eats and he drinks, and he has his calls like other men and as
he had yesterday, before they caged him. and if that's the case, what do
they mean by wanting me to believe that he is enchanted? for i have heard
many a one say that enchanted people neither eat, nor sleep, nor talk;
and my master, if you don't stop him, will talk more than thirty
lawyers." then turning to the curate he exclaimed, "ah, senor curate,

t."

the barber did not care to answer sancho lest by his plain speaking he
should disclose what the curate and he himself were trying so hard to
conceal; and under the same apprehension the curate had asked the canon
to ride on a little in advance, so that he might tell him the mystery of
this man in the cage, and other things that would amuse him. the canon
agreed, and going on ahead with his servants, listened with attention to
the account of the character, life, madness, and ways of don quixote,
given him by the curate, who described to him briefly the beginning and
origin of his craze, and told him the whole story of his adventures up to
his being confined in the cage, together with the plan they had of taking
him home to try if by any means they could discover a cure for his
madness. the canon and his servants were surprised anew when they heard
don quixote's strange story, and when it was finished he said, "to tell
the truth, senor curate, i for my part consider what they ca

their battles, silly in their arguments, absurd in their travels, and, in
short, wanting in everything like intelligent art; for which reason they
deserve to be banished from the christian commonwealth as a worthless

the curate listened to him attentively and felt that he was a man of
sound understanding, and that there was good reason in what he said; so
he told him that, being of the same opinion himself, and bearing a grudge
to books of chivalry, he had burned all don quixote's, which were many;
and gave him an account of the scrutiny he had made of them, and of those
he had condemned to the flames and those he had spared, with which the
canon was not a little amused, adding that though he had said so much in
condemnation of these books, still he found one good thing in them, and
that was the opportunity they afforded to a gifted intellect for
displaying itself; for they presented a wide and spacious field over
which the pen might range freely, describing shi

and plentiful pasture for the oxen, while we take our noontide rest."

"and so it seems," returned the curate, and he told the canon what he
proposed to do, on which he too made up his mind to halt with them,
attracted by the aspect of the fair valley that lay before their eyes;
and to enjoy it as well as the conversation of the curate, to whom he had
begun to take a fancy, and also to learn more particulars about the
doings of don quixote, he desired some of his servants to go on to the
inn, which was not far distant, and fetch from it what eatables there
might be for the whole party, as he meant to rest for the afternoon where
he was; to which one of his servants replied that the sumpter mule, which
by this time ought to have reached the inn, carried provisions enough to
make it unnecessary to get anything from the inn except barley.

"in that case," said the canon, "take all the beasts there, and bring the

"i do not understand 'going anywhere,'" said don quixote; "explain

the point."

"is it possible," said sancho, "that your worship does not understand
'going anywhere'? why, the schoolboys know that from the time they were
babes. well then, you must know i mean have you had any desire to do what
cannot be avoided?"

you to such a pass that you have to be shut up in a cage and carried on
an ox-cart as one would carry a lion or a tiger from place to place to
make money by showing it. come, senor don quixote, have some compassion
for yourself, return to the bosom of common sense, and make use of the
liberal share of it that heaven has been pleased to bestow upon you,
employing your abundant gifts of mind in some other reading that may
serve to benefit your conscience and add to your honour. and if, still
led away by your natural bent, you desire to read books of achievements
and of chivalry, read the book of judges in the holy scriptures, for

follow the arduous calling of knight-errantry which they set forth; for
you deny that there ever were amadises of gaul or of greece, or any other
of the knights of whom the books are full."

"it is all exactly as you state it," said the canon; to which don quixote
returned, "you also went on to say that books of this kind had done me
much harm, inasmuch as they had upset my senses, and shut me up in a
cage, and that it would be better for me to reform and change my studies,
and read other truer books which would afford more pleasure and
instruction."

"just so," said the canon.

"well then," returned don quixote, "to my mind it is you who are the one
that is out of his wits and enchanted, as you have ventured to utter such
blasphemies against

achievements of christian knights of these and foreign realms, which are
so authentic and true, that, i repeat, he who denies them must be totally
wanting in reason and good sense."

the canon was amazed to hear the medley of truth and fiction don quixote
uttered, and to see how well acquainted he was with everything relating
or belonging to the achievements of his knight-errantry; so he said in
reply:

"i cannot deny, senor don quixote, that there is some truth in what you
say, especially as regards the spanish knights-errant; and i am willing
to grant too that the twelve peers of france existed, but i am not
disposed to believe that they did all the things that the archbishop
turpin relates of them. for the truth of the matter is they

"a good joke, that!" returned don quixote. "books that have been printed

have been submitted, and read with universal delight, and extolled by
great and small, rich and poor, learned and ignorant, gentle and simple,

offer me some opportunity of making myself an emperor, so as to show my
heart in doing good to my friends, particularly to this poor sancho
panza, my squire, who is the best fellow in the world; and i would gladly
give him a county i have promised him this ever so long, only that i am
afraid he has not the capacity to govern his realm."

sancho partly heard these last words of his master, and said to him,
"strive hard you, senor don quixote, to give me that county so often
promised by you and so long looked for by me, for i promise you there
will be no want of capacity in me to govern it; and even if there is, i
have heard say there are men in the world who farm seigniories, paying so
much a year, and they themselves taking charge of the government, while
the lord, with his legs stretched out, enjoys the revenue they pay him,
without troubling himself about anything else. that's what i'll do, and
not stand haggling over tri

nothing more to desire, and when one has nothing more to desire there is
an end of it; so let the county come, and god be with you, and let us see
one another, as one blind man said to the other."

"that is not bad philosophy thou art talking, sancho," said the canon;
"but for all that there is a good deal to be said on this matter of
counties."

to which don quixote returned, "i know not what more there is to be said;
i only guide myself by the example set me by the great amadis of gaul,
when he made his squire count of the insula firme; and so, without any
scruples of conscience, i can make a count of sancho panza, for he is one
of the best squires that ever knight-errant had."

the canon was astonished at the methodical nonsense (if nonsense be
capable of method) that don quixote uttered, at the way in which he had
described the adventure of the

"at all events, senor," returned the goatherd, "they shelter men of
experience; and that you may see the truth of this and grasp it, though i
may seem to put myself forward without being asked, i will, if it will
not tire you, gentlemen, and you will give me your attention for a
little, tell you a true story which will confirm this gentleman's word
(and he pointed to the curate) as well as my own."

to this don quixote replied, "seeing that this affair has a certain
colour of chivalry about it, i for my part, brother, will hear you most
gladly, and so will all these gentlemen, from the high intelligence they
possess and their love of curious novelties that interest, charm, and
entertain the mind, as i feel quite sure your story will do. so begin,
friend, for we are all prepared to listen."

"i draw my stakes," said sancho, "and will retreat with this pasty to the

yself for three days; for i have
heard my lord, don quixote, say that a knight-errant's squire should eat
until he can hold no more, whenever he has the chance, because it often
happens them to get by accident into a wood so thick that they cannot
find a way out of it for six days; and if the man is not well filled or
his alforjas well stored, there he may stay, as very often he does,
turned into a dried mummy."

"thou art in the right of it, sancho," said don quixote; "go where thou
wilt and eat all thou canst, for i have had enough, and only want to give
my mind its refreshment, as i shall by listening to this good fellow's
story."

"it is what we shall all do," said the canon; and then begged the
goatherd to begin the promised tale.

the goatherd gave the goat which he held by the horns a couple of slaps
on the back, saying, "lie down here beside me, spotty, for we have time
enough to return to our fold." the goat seemed to understand him, for a

of the quarrel that don quixote had with the goatherd, together with the
rare adventure of the penitents, which with an expenditure of sweat he
brought to a happy conclusion


the goatherd's tale gave great satisfaction to all the hearers, and the
canon especially enjoyed it, for he had remarked with particular
attention the manner in which it had been told, which was as unlike the
manner of a clownish goatherd as it was like that of a polished city wit;
and he observed that the curate had been quite right in saying

that the
woods bred men of learning. they all offered their services to eugenio
but he who showed himself most liberal in this way was don quixote, who
said to him, "most assuredly, brother goatherd, if i found myself in a
position to attempt any adventure, i would, this very instant, set out on
your behalf, and would rescue leandra from that convent (where no doubt
she is kept against her will), in spite of the abbess and all who might
try to prevent me, and would place her in your hands to deal with her
according to your will and pleasure, observing, however, the laws of
chivalry which lay down that no violence of any kind is to

enchanter may not prove so great but that the power of another better
disposed may prove superior to it, and then i promise you my support and
assistance, as i am bound to do by my profession, which is none other
than to give aid to the weak and needy."

the goatherd eyed him, and noticing don quixote's sorry appearance and
looks, he was filled with wonder, and asked the barber, who was next him,
"senor, who is this man who makes such a figure and talks in such a
strain?"

"who should it be," said the barber, "but the famous don quixote of la
mancha, the undoer of injustice, the righter of wrongs, the protector of
damsels, the terror of giants, and the winner of battles?"

"that," said the goatherd, "sounds like what one reads in the books of
the knights-errant, who did all that yo

my belief that either you are joking, or else this gentleman has empty

"you are a great scoundrel," said don quixote, "and it is you who are
empty and a fool. i am fuller than ever was the whoreson bitch that bore
you;" and passing from words to deeds, he caught up a loaf that was near
him and sent it full in the goatherd's face, with such force that he
flattened his nose; but the goatherd, who did not understand jokes, and
found himself roughly handled in such good earnest, paying no respect to
carpet, tablecloth, or diners, sprang upon don quixote, and seizing him
by the throat with both hands would

no doubt have throttled him, had not
sancho panza that instant come to the rescue, and grasping him by the
shoulders flung him down on the table, smashing plates, breaking glasses,
and upsetting and scattering everything on it. don quixote, finding
himself free, strove to get on top of the goatherd, who, with his face
covered with blood, and soundly kicked by sancho, was on all fours
feeling about for one of the table-knives to take a bloody revenge with.
the canon and the curate, however, prevented him, but the barber so
contrived it that he got don quixote under him, and rained down upon him
such a shower of fisticuffs that the poor knight's face streamed with
blood as freely as his own. the canon and the curate were bur

grasp of one of the canon's servants, who kept him from going to his

at last, while they were all, with the exception of the two bruisers who
were mauling each other, in high glee and enjoyment, they heard a trumpet
sound a note so doleful that it made them all look in the direction
whence the sound seemed to come. but the one that was most excited by
hearing it was don quixote, who though sorely against his will he was
under the goatherd, and something more than pretty well pummelled, said
to him, "brother devil (for it is impossible but that thou must be one
since thou hast had might and strength enough to overcome mine), i ask
thee to agree to a truce for but one hour for the solemn note of yonder
trumpet that falls on our ears seems to me to summon me to some new
adventure." the goatherd, who was by this time tired of pummelling and
being pummelled, release

and turning his eyes to the quarter where the sound had been heard,
suddenly saw coming down the slope of a hill several men clad in white
like penitents.

the fact was that the clouds had that year withheld their moisture from
the earth, and in all the villages of the district they were organising
processions, rogations, and penances, imploring god to open the hands of
his mercy and send the rain; and to this end the people of a village that
was hard by were going i

n procession to a holy hermitage there was on one
side of that valley. don quixote when he saw the strange garb of the
penitents, without reflecting how often he had seen it before, took it
into his head that this was a case of adventure, and that it fell to him
alone as a knight-errant to engage in it; and he was all the more
confirmed in this notion, by the idea that an image draped in black they
had with them was some illustrious lady that these villains and
discourteous thieves were carrying off by force. as soon as this occurred
to him he ran with all speed to roc

he had no spurs--and at a full canter (for in all this veracious history
we never read of rocinante fairly galloping) set off to encounter the
penitents, though the curate, the canon, and the barber ran to prevent
him. but it was out of their power, nor did he even stop for the shouts
of sancho calling after him, "where are you going, senor don quixote?
what devils have possessed you to set you on against our catholic faith?
plague take me! mind, that is a procession of penitents, and the lady
they are carrying on that stand there is the blessed image of the
immaculate virgin. take care what you are doing, senor, for this time it
may be safely said you don't know what you are about." sancho laboured in
vain, for his master was so bent on coming to quarters with these sheeted
figures and releasing the lady in black that he did not hear

 not have turned back if the king had ordered
him. he came up with the procession and reined in rocinante, who was
already anxious enough to slacken speed a little, and in a hoarse,
excited voice he exclaimed, "you who hide your faces, perhaps because you
are not good subjects, pay attention and listen to what i am about to say
to you." the first to halt were those who were carrying the image, and
one of the four ecclesiastics who were chanting the litany, struck by the
strange figure of don quixote, the leanness of rocinante, and the other
ludicrous peculiarities he observed, said in reply to him, "brother, if
you have anything to say to us say it quickly, for these brethren are
whipping themselves, and we cannot stop, nor is it reasonable we should
stop to hear anything, unless indeed it is short enough to be said in two
words."

"i will say it in one," replied don quixote, "and it is this; that at
once, this very instant, ye release that fair lady whose tears and sad
aspect sho

red to her the liberty
she pines for and deserves."

from these words all the hearers concluded that he must be a madman, and
began to laugh heartily, and their laughter acted like gunpowder on don
quixote's fury, for drawing his sword without another word he made a rush
at the stand. one of those who supported it, leaving the burden to his
comrades, advanced to meet him, flourishing a forked stick that he had
for propping up the stand when resting, and with this he caught a mighty
cut don quixote made at him that severed it in two; but with the portion
that remained in his hand he dealt such a thwack on the shoulder of don
quixote's sword arm (which the buckler could not protect against the
clownish assault) that poor don quixote came to the ground in a sad
plight.

sancho panza, who was coming on close behind puffing and blowing, seeing
him fall, cried out to his assailant not to strike him again, for he was
a poor enchanted knight, who had never harmed anyone all the days of h

life; but what checked the clown was, not sancho's shouting, but seeing
that don quixote did not stir hand or foot; and so, fancying he had
killed him, he hastily hitched up his tunic under his girdle and took to
his heels across the country like a deer.

by this time all don quixote's companions had come up to where he lay;
but the processionists seeing them come running, and with them the
officers of the brotherhood with their crossbows, apprehended mischief,
and clustering round the image, raised their hoods, and grasped their
scourges, as the priests did their tapers, and awaited the attack,
resolved to defend themselves and even to take the offensive against
their assailants if they could. fortune, however, arranged the matter
better than they expected, for all

sancho did was to fling himself on his
master's body, raising over him the most doleful and laughable
lamentation that ever was heard, for he believed he was dead. the curate
was known to another curate who walked in the procession, and their
recognition of one another set at rest the apprehensions of both parties;
the first then told the other in two words who don quixote was, and he
and the whole troop of penitents went to see if the poor gentleman was
dead, and heard sancho panza saying, with tears in his eyes, "oh flower
of chivalry, that with one blow of a stick hast ended the course of thy
well-spent life! oh pride of thy race, honour and glory of all la mancha,
nay, of all the world, that for want of thee will be full of evil-doers,
no longer in fear of punishment for their misdeeds! oh thou, generous

outrages, enamoured without reason, imitator of the good, scourge of the
wicked, enemy of the mean, in short, knight-errant, which is all that can
be said!"

at the cries and moans of sancho, don quixote came to himself, and the
first word he said was, "he who lives separated from you, sweetest
dulcinea, has greater miseries to endure than these. aid me, friend
sancho, to mount the enchanted cart, for i am not in a condition to press
the saddle of rocinante, as this shoulder is all knocked to pieces."

"that i will do with all my heart, senor," said sancho; "and let us
return to our village with these gentlemen, who seek your good, and there
we will prepare for making another sally, whi

profitable and creditable to us."

"thou art right, sancho," returned don quixote; "it will be wise to let
the malign influence of the stars which now prevails pass off."

the canon, the curate, and the barber told him he would act very wisely
in doing as he said; and so, highly amused at sancho panza's
simplicities, they placed don quixote in the cart as before. the
procession once more formed itself in order and proceeded on its road;
the goatherd took his leave of the party; the officers of the brotherhood
declined to go any farther, and the curate paid them what was due to
them; the canon begged the curate to let him know how don quixote did,
whether he was cured of his madness or still suffered from it, and then
begged leave to continue his journey; in short, they all separated and
went their ways, leaving to themselve

deliberate pace took the road the curate directed, and at the end of six
days they reached don quixote's village, and entered it about the middle

dispel the loathing and disgust caused by another don quixote who, under
the name of second part, has run masquerading through the whole world.
and he who has shown the greatest longing for him has been the great
emperor of china, who wrote me a letter in chinese a month ago and sent
it by a special courier. he asked me, or to be truthful, he begged me to
send him don quixote, for he intended to found a college where the
spanish tongue would be taught, and it was his wish that the book to be
read should be the history of don quixote. he also added

that no one may dare to bring forward any further evidence against him,

reputable person should have given an account of all these shrewd
lunacies of his without going into the matter again; for abundance, even

chapter i.

of the interview the curate and the barber had with don quixote about his
malady


cide hamete benengeli, in the second part of this history, and third
sally of don quixote, says that the curate and the barber remained nearly
a month without seeing him, lest they should recall or bring back to his
recollection what had taken place. they did not, however, omit to visit
his niece and housekeeper, and charge them to be careful to treat him
with attention, and give him comforting things to eat, and such as were
good for the heart and the brain, whence, it was plain to see, all his
misfortune proceeded. the niece and housekeeper replied that they did so,
and mea

course of their conversation they fell to discussing what they call
state-craft and systems of government, correcting this abuse and
condemning that, reforming one practice and abolishing another, each of
the three setting up for a new legislator, a modern lycurgus, or a
brand-new solon; and so completely did they remodel the state, that they
seemed to have thrust it into a furnace and taken out something quite
different from what they had put in; and on all the subjects they dealt
with, don quixote spoke with such good sense that the pair of examiners
were fully convinced that he was quite recovered and in his full senses.

the niece and housekeeper were present at the conversation and could not
find words enough to express their thanks to god at seeing their master
so clear in his mind; the curate, however, changing his original plan,
which was to avoid touching upon matters of chivalry, resolved to test
don quixote's recovery thoroughly, and see whether it were genuine or
not; a

another, he came at last to talk of the
news that had come from the capital, and, among other things, he said it
was considered certain that the turk was coming down with a powerful
fleet, and that no one knew what his purpose was, or when the great storm
would burst; and that all christendom was in apprehension of this, which
almost every year calls us to arms, and that his majesty had made
provision for the security of the coasts of naples and sicily and the
island of malta.

to this don quixote replied, "his majesty has acted like a prudent
warrior in providing for the safety of his realms in time, so that the
enemy may not find him unprepared; but if my advice were taken i would
recommend him to adopt a measure which at present, no doubt, his majesty
is very far from thinking of."

the moment the curate heard this he said to himself, "god keep thee in
his hand, poor don quixote, for it seems to me thou art precipitating
thyself from the height of thy madness into the profound
 
 ___________________________
 
 abyss of thy
simplicity."

but the barber, who had the same suspicion as the curate, asked don
quixote what would be his advice as to the measures that he said ought to
be adopted; for perhaps it might prove to be one that would have to be
added to the list of the many impertinent suggestions that people were in
the habit of offering to princes.

"mine, master shaver," said don quixote, "will not be impertinent, but,
on the contrary, pertinent."

"i don't mean that," said the barber, "but that experience has shown that
all or most of the expedients which are proposed to his majesty are
either impossible, or absurd, or injurious to the king and to the
kingdom."

"mine, however," replied don quixote, "is neither impossible nor absurd,
but the easiest, the most reasonable, the readiest and most expeditious
that could suggest itself to any projector's mind."

"you tak

e a long time to tell it, senor don quixote," said the curate.

"i don't choose to tell it here, now," said don quixote, "and have it
reach the ears of the lords of the council to-morrow morning, and some
other carry off the thanks and rewards of my trouble."

"for my part," said the barber, "i give my word here and before god that
i will not repeat what your worship says, to king, rook or earthly
man--an oath i learned from the ballad of the curate, who, in the
prelude, told the king of the thief who had robbed him of the hundred
gold crowns and his pacing mule."

"i am not versed in stories," said do

n quixote; "but i know the oath is a
good one, because i know the barber to be an honest fellow."

"even if he were not," said the curate, "i will go bail and answer for
him that in this matter he will be as silent as a dummy, under pain of
paying any penalty that may be pronounced."

"and who will be security for you, senor curate?" said don quixote.

"my profession," replied the curate, "which is to keep secrets."

"ods body!" said don quixote at this, "what more has his majesty to do
but to command, by public proclamation, all the knights-errant that are
scattered over spain to assemble on a fixed day in the capital, for even
if no more than half a dozen come, there may be one among them who alone
will suffice to destroy the entire might of the turk. give me your
attention and follow me. is it, pray, any new thing for a single
knight-errant to demolish an army of two hundred thousand men, as if they
all had but one throat or

ogeny of amadis of gaul! if
any these were alive today, and were to come face to face with the turk,
by my faith, i would not give much for the turk's chance. but god will
have regard for his people, and will provide some one, who, if not so
valiant as the knights-errant of yore, at least will not be inferior to
them in spirit; but god knows what i mean, and i say no more."

"alas!" exclaimed the niece at this, "may i die if my master does not
want to turn knight-errant again;" to which don quixote replied, "a
knight-errant i shall die, and let the turk come down or go up when he
likes, and in as strong force as he can, once more i say, god knows what
i mean." but here the barber said, "i ask your worships to give me leave
to tell a short story of something that happened in seville, which comes
so pat to the purpose just now that i should like greatly to tell it."
don quixote gave him leave, and the rest prepared to listen, and he began
thus:

"in the madhouse at seville there wa

as it pleases me and may be needful.'

"the governor and the bystanders laughed, and at their laughter the
chaplain was half ashamed, and he replied, 'for all that, senor neptune,
it will not do to vex senor jupiter; remain where you are, and some other
day, when there is a better opportunity and more time, we will come back
for you.' so they stripped the licentiate, and he was left where he was;
and that's the end of the story."

"so that's the story, master barber," said don quixote, "which came in so
pat to the purpose that you could not help telling it? master shaver,
master shaver! how blind is he who cannot see through a sieve. is it
possible that you do not know that comparisons of wit with wit, valour
with valour, beauty with beauty, birth with birth, are always odious and
unwelcome? i, master barber, am not neptune, the god of the waters, nor
do i try to make anyone take me for an astute man, for i am not one. my
only endeavour is to convince the world of the

s-errant, the light and glory of chivalry. these, or
such as these, i would have to carry out my plan, and in that case his
majesty would find himself well served and would save great expense, and
the turk would be left tearing his beard. and so i will stay where i am,
as the chaplain does not take me away; and if jupiter, as the barber has
told us, will not send rain, here am i, and i will rain when i please. i
say this that master basin may know that i understand him."

"indeed, senor don quixote," said the barber, "i did not mean it in that
way, and, so help me god, my intention was good, and your worship ought
not to be vexed."

"as to whether i ought to be vexed or not," returned don quixote, "i
myself am the best judge."

hereupon the curate observed, "i have hardly said a word as yet; and i
would gladly be relieved of a doubt, arising from what don quixote has
said, that worries and works my conscience."

"the senor curate has leave for more than that," returned don quix

ote,
"so he may declare his doubt, for it is not pleasant to have a doubt on
one's conscience."

"well then, with that permission," said the curate, "i say my doubt is
that, all i can do, i cannot persuade myself that the whole pack of
knights-errant you, senor don quixote, have mentioned, were really and
truly persons of flesh and blood, that ever lived in the world; on the
contrary, i suspect it to be all fiction, fable, and falsehood, and
dreams told by men awakened from sleep, or rather still half asleep."

"that is another mistake," replied don quixote, "into which many have
fallen who do not believe that there ever were such knights in the world,
and i have often, with divers people and on divers occasions, tried to
expose this almost universal erro

nd quick to put it away from him; and as i have depicted
amadis, so i could, i think, portray and describe all the knights-errant
that are in all the histories in the world; for by the perception i have
that they were what their histories describe, and by the deeds they did
and the dispositions they displayed, it is possible, with the aid of
sound philosophy, to deduce their features, complexion, and stature."

"how big, in your worship's opinion, may the giant morgante have been,
senor don quixote?" asked the barber.

"with regard to giants," replied don quixote, "opinions differ as to
whether there ever were any or not in the world; but the holy scripture,
which cannot err by a jot from the truth, shows us that there were, when
it gives us the history of that big philistine, goliath, who was seven
cubits and a half in height, which is a huge size. likewise, in the
island of sicily, there have been found leg-bones and arm-bones so large
that their size makes it plain that their o

he history in which his deeds are particularly
mentioned, that he frequently slept under a roof and as he found houses
to contain him, it is clear that his bulk could not have been anything
excessive."

"that is true," said the curate, and yielding to the enjoyment of hearing
such nonsense, he asked him what was his notion of the features of
reinaldos of montalban, and don roland and the rest of the twelve peers
of france, for they were all knights-errant.

"as for reinaldos," replied don quixote, "i venture to say that he was
broad-faced, of ruddy complexion, with roguish and somewhat prominent
eyes, excessively punctilious and touchy, and given to the society of
thieves and scapegraces. with regard to roland, or rotolando, or orlando
(for the histories call him by all these names), i am of opinion, and
hold, that he was of middle height, broad-shouldered, rather bow-legged,
swarthy-complexioned, red-bearded, with a hairy body and a severe
expression of countenance, a man of few
 
 ___________________________
 
 words, but very polite and
well-bred."

"if roland was not a more graceful person than your worship has
described," said the curate, "it is no wonder that the fair lady angelica
rejected him and left him for the gaiety, liveliness, and grace of that
budding-bearded little moor to whom she surrendered herself; and she
showed her sense in falling in love with the gentle softness of medoro
rather than the roughness of roland."

"that angelica, senor curate," returned don quixote, "was a giddy damsel,
flighty and somewhat wanton, and she left the world as full of her
vagaries as of the fame of her beauty. she treated with scorn a thousand
gentlemen, men of valour and wisdom, and took up with a smooth-faced
sprig of a page, without fortune or fame, except such reputation for
gratitude as the affection he bore his friend got for him. the great poet
who sang her beauty, the famous ariosto, not caring to sing her
adventures after her contemptible surrender (which pro
 
 ___________________________
 
bably were not over
and above creditable), dropped her where he says:

how she received the sceptre of cathay,
some bard of defter quill may sing some day;

and this was no doubt a kind of prophecy, for poets are also called
vates, that is to say diviners; and its truth was made plain; for since
then a famous andalusian poet has lamented and sung her tears, and
another famous and rare poet, a castilian, has sung her beauty."

"tell me, senor don quixote," said the barber here, "among all those who
praised her, has there been no poet to write a satire on this lady
angelica?"

"i can well believe," replied don quixote, "that if sacripante or roland
had been poets they would have given the damsel a trimming; for it is
naturally the way with poets who have been scorned and rejected by their
ladies, whether fictitious or not, in short by those whom they select as
the ladies of their thoughts, to avenge themselves in satires and
libels--a v

famatory verse against the lady
angelica, who turned the world upside down."

"strange," said the curate; but at this moment they heard the housekeeper
and the niece, who had previously withdrawn from the conversation,
exclaiming aloud in the courtyard, and at the noise they all ran out.




chapter ii.

which treats of the notable altercation which sancho panza had with don
quixote's niece, and housekeeper, together with other droll matters


the history relates that the outcry don quixote, the curate, and the
barber heard came from the niece and the housekeeper exclaiming to
sancho, who was striving to force his way in to see don quixote while
they held the door against him, "what does the vagabond want in this
house? be off to your own, brother, for it is you, and no one else, that
delude my master, and lead him astray, and take him tramping about the
country."

to which sancho replied, "devil's own housekeeper! it is i who am
deluded, and led astray, and taken trampin

is it something to eat, glutton and gormandiser that
thou art?"

"it is not something to eat," replied sancho, "but something to govern
and rule, and better than four cities or four judgeships at court."

"for all that," said the housekeeper, "you don't enter here, you bag of
mischief and sack of knavery; go govern your house and dig your
seed-patch, and give over looking for islands or shylands."

the curate and the barber listened with great amusement to the words of
the three; but don quixote, uneasy lest sancho should blab and blurt out
a whole heap of mischievous stupidities, and touch upon points that might
not be altogether to his credit, called to him and made the other two
hold their tongues and let him come in. sancho entered, and the curate
and the barber took their leave of don quixote, of whose recovery they
despaired when they saw how wedded he was to his crazy ideas, and how
saturated with the nonsense of his unlucky chivalry; and said the curate
to the barber, "y

what comes of all these absurdities of the knight and squire, for it
seems as if they had both been cast in the same mould, and the madness of
the master without the simplicity of the man would not be worth a
farthing."

"that is true," said the barber, "and i should like very much to know
what the pair are talking about at this moment."

"i promise you," said the curate, "the niece or the housekeeper will tell
us by-and-by, for they are not the ones to forget to listen."

meanwhile don quixote shut himself up in his room with sancho, and when

shouldst have said, and sayest, that i took thee out of thy cottage, when
thou knowest i did not remain in my house. we sallied forth together, we
took the road together, we wandered abroad together; we have had the same
fortune and the same luck; if they blanketed thee once, they belaboured
me a hundred times, and that is the only advantage i have of thee."

"that

 was only reasonable," replied sancho, "for, by what your worship
says, misfortunes belong more properly to knights-errant than to their
squires."

"thou art mistaken, sancho," said don quixote, "according to the maxim
quando caput dolet, etc."

"i don't understand any language but my own," said sancho.

"i mean to say," said don quixote, "that when the head suffers all the
members suffer; and so, being thy lord and master, i am thy head, and
thou a part of me as thou art my servant; and therefore any evil that
affects or shall affect me should give thee pain, and what affects thee
give pain to me."

"it should be so," said sancho; "but when i was blanketed as a member, my
head was on the other side of the wall, looking on while i was flying
through the air, and did not feel any pain whatever; and if the members
are ob

liged to feel the suffering of the head, it should be obliged to
feel their sufferings."

"dost thou mean to say now, sancho," said don quixote, "that i did not
feel when they were blanketing thee? if thou dost, thou must not say so
or think so, for i felt more pain then in spirit than thou didst in body.
but let us put that aside for the present, for we shall have
opportunities enough for considering and settling the point; tell me,
sancho my friend, what do they say about me in the village here? what do
the common people think of me? what do the hidalgos? what do the
caballeros? what do they say of my valour; of my achievement

ore than ours, which i hold to be
the golden of these latter days. profit by this advice, sancho, and
report to me clearly and faithfully the truth of what thou knowest
touching what i have demanded of thee."

"that i will do with all my heart, master," replied sancho, "provided
your worship will not be vexed at what i say, as you wish me to say it
out in all its nakedness, without putting any more clothes on it than it
came to my knowledge in."

"i will not be vexed at all," returned don quixote; "thou mayest speak
freely, sancho, and without any beating about the bush."

"well then," said he, "first of all, i have to tell you that the common
people consider your worship a mighty great madman, and me no less a
fool. the hidalgos say that, not keeping within the bounds of your
quality of gentleman, you have assumed the 'don,' and made a knight of
yourself at a jump, with four vine-stocks and a couple of acres of land,
and never a shirt to your back. the caballeros say they do no

t want to
have hidalgos setting up in opposition to them, particularly squire
hidalgos who polish their own shoes and darn their black stockings with
green silk."

"that," said don quixote, "does not apply to me, for i always go well
dressed and never patched; ragged i may be, but ragged more from the wear
and tear of arms than of time."

"as to your worship's valour, courtesy, accomplishments, and task, there
is a variety of opinions. some say, 'mad but droll;' others, 'valiant but
unlucky;' others, 'courteous but meddling,' and then they go into such a
number of things that they don't leave a whole bone either in your
worship or in myself."

"recollect, sancho," said

not particularly cleanly in his dress, or pure in his morals. of

hast said."

"that's just where it is, body of my father!"

"is there more, then?" asked don quixote.

"there's the tail to be skinned yet," said sancho; "all so far is cakes
and fancy bread; but if your worship wants to know all about the
calumnies they bring against you, i will fetch you one this instant who
can tell you the whole of them without missing an atom; for last night
the son of bartholomew carrasco, who has been studying at salamanca, came
home after having been made a bachelor, and when i went to welcome him,
he told me that your worship's history is already abroad in boo

ks, with
the title of the ingenious gentleman don quixote of la mancha; and he
says they mention me in it by my own name of sancho panza, and the lady
dulcinea del toboso too, and divers things that happened to us when we
were alone; so that i crossed myself in my wonder how the historian who
wrote them down could have known them."

"i promise thee, sancho," said don quixote, "the author of our history
will be some sage enchanter; for to such nothing that they choose to
write about is hidden."

"what!" said sancho, "a sage and an enchanter! why, the bachelor samson
carrasco (that is the name of him i spoke of) says the author of the
history is called cide hamete berengena."

"that is a moorish name," said don quixote.

"may be so," replied sancho; "for i have heard say that the moors are
mostly great lovers of berengenas."

"thou must have mistaken the

 surname of this 'cide'--which means in
arabic 'lord'--sancho," observed don quixote.

"very likely," replied sancho, "but if your worship wishes me to fetch
the bachelor i will go for him in a twinkling."

"thou wilt do me a great pleasure, my friend," said don quixote, "for
what thou hast told me has amazed me, and i shall not eat a morsel that
will agree with me until i have heard all about it."

"then i am off for him," said sancho; and leaving his master he went in
quest of the bachelor, with whom he returned in a short time, and, all
three together, they had a very droll colloquy.

 he was afraid he might have dealt
with his love affairs in some indecorous fashion, that might tend to the
discredit and prejudice of the purity of his lady dulcinea del toboso; he
would have had him set forth the fidelity and respect he had always
observed towards her, spurning queens, empresses, and damsels of all
sorts, and keeping in check the impetuosity of his natural impulses.
absorbed and wrapped up in these and divers other cogitations, he was
found by sancho and carrasco, whom don quixote received with great
courtesy.

the bachelor, though he was called samson, was of no great bodily size,
but he was a very great wag; he was of a sallow complexion, but very
sharp-witted, somewhere about four-and-twenty years of age, with a round
face, a flat nose, and a large mouth, all indications of a mischievous
disposition and a love of fun and jokes; and of this he gave a sample as
soon as he saw don quixote, by falling on his knees before him and
saying, "let me kiss your mightine

great deeds, and a double blessing on that connoisseur who took the
trouble of having it translated out of the arabic into our castilian
vulgar tongue for the universal entertainment of the people!"

"so true is it, senor," said samson, "that my belief is there are more
than twelve thousand volumes of the said history in print this very day.
only ask portugal, barcelona, and valencia, where they have been printed,
and moreover there is a report that it is being printed at antwerp, and i
am persuaded there will not be a country or language in which there will
not be a translation of it."

"one of the things," here observed don quixote, "that ought to give most
pleasure to a virtuous and eminent man is to find himself in his lifetime
in print and in type, familiar in people's mouths with a good name; i say
with a good name, for if it be the opposite, then there is no death to be
compared to it."

"if it goes by good name and fame," said the bachelor, "your worship
alone bears away the palm from all the knights-errant; for the moor in
his own language, and the christian in his, have taken care to set before
us your ga

fortitude in adversity, your patience under misfortunes as well as

"i never heard my lady dulcinea called dona," observed sancho here;
"nothing more than the lady dulcinea del toboso; so here already the
history is wrong."

"that is not an objection of any importance," replied carrasco.

"certainly not," said don quixote; "but tell me, senor bachelor, what
deeds of mine are they that are made most of in this history?"

"on that point," replied the bachelor, "opinions differ, as tastes do;
some swear by the adventure of the windmills that your worship took to be
briareuses and giants; others by that of the fulling mills; one cries up
the description of the two armies that afterwards took the appearance of
two droves of sheep; another that of the dead body on its way to be
buried at segovia; a third says

"tell me, senor bachelor," said sancho at this point, "does the adventure
with the yanguesans come in, when our good rocinante went hankering after
dainties?"

"the sage has left nothing in the ink-bottle," replied samson; "he tells
all and sets down everything, even to the capers that worthy sancho cut
in the blanket."

"i cut no capers in the blanket," returned sancho; "in the air i did, and
more of them than i liked."

"there is no human history in the world, i suppose," said don quixote,
"that has not its ups and downs, but more than others such as deal with
chivalry, for they can never be entirely made up of prosperous
adventures."

"for all that," replied the bachelor, "there are those who have read the
history who say they would have been glad if the author had left out some
of the countless cudgellings that were inflicted on senor don quixote in
various encounters."

"that's where the truth of the history comes in," said sancho.

"at the same time they might fa

irly have passed them over in silence,"
observed don quixote; "for there is no need of recording events which do
not change or affect the truth of a history, if they tend to bring the
hero of it into contempt. aeneas was not in truth and earnest so pious as
virgil represents him, nor ulysses so wise as homer describes him."

"that is true," said samson; "but it is one thing to write as a poet,
another to write as a historian; the poet may describe or sing things,
not as they were, but as they ought to have been; but the historian has
to write the

ht to have been, but as they were,
without adding anything to the truth or taking anything from it."

"well then," said sancho, "if this senor moor goes in for telling the
truth, no doubt among my master's drubbings mine are to be found; for
they never took the measure of his worship's shoulders without doing the
same for my whole body; but i have no right to wonder at that, for, as my
master himself says, the members must share the pain of the head."

"you are a sly dog, sancho," said don quixote; "i' faith, you have no
want of memory when you choose to remember."

"if i were to try to forget the thwacks they gave me," said sancho, "my
weals would not let me, for they are still fresh on my ribs."

"hush, sancho," said don quixote, "and don't interrupt the bachelor, whom
i entreat to go on and tell all that is said about me in this history."

"and about me," said sancho, "for they say, too, that i am one of the
principal presonages in it."

"personages, not presonages, friend

o," said samson.

"what! another word-catcher!" said sancho; "if that's to be the way we
shall not make an end in a lifetime."

"may god shorten mine, sancho," returned the bachelor, "if you are not
the second person in the history, and there are even some who would
rather hear you talk than the cleverest in the whole book; though there
are some, too, who say you showed yourself over-credulous in believing
there was any possibility in the government of that island offered you by
senor don quixote."

"there is still sunshine on the wall," said don quixote; "and when sancho
is somewhat more advanced in life, with the experience that years bring,
he will be fitter and better qualified for being a governor than he is at
present."

"by god, master," said sancho, "the island that i cannot govern with the
years i have, i'll not be able to govern with the years of methuselah;
the difficulty is that the said island keeps its distance somewhere, i
know not where; and not that there is a

ny want of head in me to govern
it."

"leave it to god, sancho," said don quixote, "for all will be and perhaps
better than you think; no leaf on the tree stirs but by god's will."

"that is true," said samson; "and if it be god's will, there will not be
any want of a thousand islands, much less one, for sancho to govern."

"i have seen governors in these parts," said sancho, "that are not to be
compared to my shoe-sole; and for all that they are called 'your
lordship' and served on silver."

"those are not governors of islands," observed samson, "but of other

it."

"that would be working miracles," said samson.

"miracles or no miracles," said sancho, "let everyone mind how he speaks
or writes about people, and not set down at random the first thing that
comes into his head."

"one of the faults they find with this history," said the bachelor, "is
that its author inserted in it a novel called 'the ill-advised
curiosity;' not that it is bad or ill-told, but that it is out of place
and has nothing to do with the history of his worship senor don quixote."

"i will bet the son of a dog has mixed the cabbages and the baskets,"
said sancho.

"then, i say," said don quixote, "the author of my history was no sage,
but some ignorant chatterer, who, in a haphazard and heedless way, set
about writing it, let it turn out as it might, just as orbaneja, the
painter of ubeda, used to do, who, when they asked him what he was
painting, answered, 'what it may turn out.' sometimes he would paint a
cock in such a fashion, and so unlike, that he had t

ible."

"no fear of that," returned samson, "for it is so plain that there is
nothing in it to puzzle over; the children turn its leaves, the young
people read it, the grown men understand it, the old folk praise it; in a
word, it is so thumbed, and read, and got by heart by people of all
sorts, that the instant they see any lean hack, they say, 'there goes
rocinante.' and those that are most given to reading it are the pages,
for there is not a lord's ante-chamber where there is not a 'don quixote'
to be found; one takes it up if another lays it down; this one pounces
upon it, and that begs for it. in short, the said history is the most
delightful and least injurious entertainment that has been hitherto seen,
for there is not to be found in the whole of it even the semblance of an
immodest word, or a thought that is other than catholic."

"to write in any other way," said don quixote, "would not be to write
truth, but falsehood, and historians who have recourse to falsehood ought

the cleverest character in comedy is the clown, for he who would make
people take him for a fool, must not be one. history is in a measure a
sacred thing, for it should be true, and where the truth is, there god
is; but notwithstanding this, there are some who write and fling books
broadcast on the world as if they were fritters."

"there is no book so bad but it has something good in it," said the
bachelor.

"no doubt of that," replied don quixote; "but it often happens that those
who have acquired and attained a well-deserved reputation by their
writings, lose it entirely, or damage it in some degree, when they give
them to the press."

"the reason of that," said samson, "is, that as printed works are
examined leisurely, their faults are easily seen; and the greater the
fame of the writer, the more closely are they scrutinised. men famous for
their genius, great poets, illustrious historians, are always, or most
commonly, envie

d by those who take a particular delight and pleasure in
criticising the writings of others, without having produced any of their
own."

"that is no wonder," said don quixote; "for there are many divines who
are no good for the pulpit, but excellent in detecting the defects or
excesses of those who preach."

"all that is true, senor don quixote," said carrasco; "but i wish such
fault-finders were more lenient and less exacting, and did not pay so
much attention to the spots on the bright sun of the work they grumble
at; for if aliquando bonus dormitat homerus, they should remember how
long he remained awake to shed the light of his work with as little shade
as possible; and perhaps it may be that what they find fault with may be
moles, that sometimes heighten the beauty of the face that bears them;
and so i say very great is th

himself, for of all impossibilities the greatest is to write one that
will satisfy and please all readers."

"that which treats of me must have pleased few," said don quixote.

"quite the contrary," said the bachelor; "for, as stultorum infinitum est
numerus, innumerable are those who have relished the said history; but
some have brought a charge against the author's memory, inasmuch as he
forgot to say who the thief was who stole sancho's dapple; for it is not
stated there, but only to be inferred from what is set down, that he was
stolen, and a little farther on we see sancho mounted on the same ass,
without any reappearance of it. they say, too, that he f

woman is waiting for me; after dinner i'll come back, and will answer you
and all the world every question you may choose to ask, as well about the
loss of the ass as about the spending of the hundred crowns;" and without
another word or waiting for a reply he made off home.

don quixote begged and entreated the bachelor to stay and do penance with
him. the bachelor accepted the invitation and remained, a couple of young
pigeons were added to the ordinary fare, at dinner they talked chivalry,
carrasco fell in with his host's humour, the banquet came to an end, they
took their afternoon sleep, sancho returned, and their conversation was
resumed.

sancho came back to don quixote's house, and returning to the late
subject of conversation, he said, "as to what senor samson said, that he
would like to know by whom, or how, or when my ass was stolen, i say in
reply that the same night we went into the sierra morena, flying from the
holy brotherhood after that unlucky adventure of the galley slaves, and
the other of the corpse that was going to segovia, my master and i
ensconced ourselves in a thicket, and there, my master leaning on his
lance, and i seated on my dap

we fell asleep as if it had been on four feather mattresses; and i in
particular slept so sound, that, whoever he was, he was able to come and
prop me up on four stakes, which he put under the four corners of the
pack-saddle in such a way that he left me mounted on it, and took away
dapple from under me without my feeling it."

"that is an easy matter," said don quixote, "and it is no new occurrence,
for the same thing happened to sacripante at the siege of albracca; the
famous thief, brunello, by the same contrivance, took his horse from
between his legs."

"day came," continued sancho, "and the moment i stirred the stakes gave
way and i fell to the ground with a mighty come down; i looked about for
the ass, but could not see him; the tears rushed to my eyes and i raised
such a lamentation that, if the author of our history has not put it in,

"i don't know what to say to that," said sancho, "unless that the
historian made a mistake, or perhaps it might be a blunder of the
printer's."

"no doubt that's it," said samson; "but what became of the hundred
crowns? did they vanish?"

to which sancho answered, "i spent them for my own good, and my wife's,
and my children's, and it is they that have made my wife bear so
patiently all my wanderings on highways and byways, in the service of my
master, don quixote; for if after all this time i had come back to the
house without a rap and without the ass, it would have been a poor
look-out for me; and if anyone wants to know anything more about me, here
i am, ready to answer the king himself in person; and it is no affair of
anyone's whether i took or did not take, whether i spent or did not
spend; for the whacks that were given me in these journeys were to be
paid for in money, even if they were valued at no more than four
maravedis apiece, anothe

r hundred crowns would not pay me for half of
them. let each look to himself and not try to make out white black, and
black white; for each of us is as god made him, aye, and often worse."

"i will take care," said carrasco, "to impress upon the author of the
history that, if he prints it again, he must not forget what worthy
sancho has said, for it will raise it a good span higher."

"is there anything else to correct in the history, senor bachelor?" asked
don quixote.

"no doubt there is," replied he; "but not anything that will be of the
same importance as those i have mentioned."

"does the author promise a second part at all?" said don quixote.

"he does promise one," replied samson; "but he says he has not found it,
nor does he know who has got it; and we cannot say whether it will appear
or not; and so, on that head, as some say that no second part has ever
been good, and others that enough has been already written about don
quixote, it is t

hought there will be no second part; though some, who are
jovial rather than saturnine, say, 'let us have more quixotades, let don
quixote charge and sancho chatter, and no matter what it may turn out, we
shall be satisfied with that.'"

"and what does the author mean to do?" said don quixote.

"what?" replied samson; "why, as soon as he has found the history which
he is now searching for with extraordinary diligence, he will at once
give it to the press, moved more by the profit that may accrue to him
from doing so than by any thought of praise."

whereat sancho observed, "the author looks for money and profit, does he?
it will be a wonder if he succeeds, for it will be only hurry, hurry,
with him, like the tailor on easter eve; and works done in a hurry are
never finishe

uld make up not only one
second part, but a hundred. the good man fancies, no doubt, that we are
fast asleep in the straw here, but let him hold up our feet to be shod
and he will see which foot it is we go lame on. all i say is, that if my
master would take my advice, we would be now afield, redressing outrages
and righting wrongs, as is the use and custom of good knights-errant."

sancho had hardly uttered these words when the neighing of rocinante fell
upon their ears, which neighing don quixote accepted as a happy omen, and
he resolved to make another sally in three or four days from that time.
announcing his intention to the bachelor, he asked his advice as to the
quarter in which he ought to commence his expedition, and the bachelor
replied that in his opinion he ought to go to the kingdom of aragon, and
the city of saragossa, where there were to be certain solemn joustings at
the festival of st. george, at which he might win renown above all the
knights of aragon, which woul

attendance on him readily; but to expect me to draw sword, even against
rascally churls of the hatchet and hood, is idle. i don't set up to be a
fighting man, senor samson, but only the best and most loyal squire that
ever served knight-errant; and if my master don quixote, in consideration
of my many faithful services, is pleased to give me some island of the
many his worship says one may stumble on in these parts, i will take it
as a great favour; and if he does not give it to me, i was born like
everyone else, and a man must not live in dependence on anyone except
god; and what is more, my bread will taste as well, and perhaps even
better, without a government than if i were a governor; and how do i know

'when good luck comes to thee, take it in.'"

"brother sancho," said carrasco, "you have spoken like a professor; but,
for all that, put your trust in god and in senor don quixote, for he will
give you a kingdom, not to say an island."

"it is all the same, be it more or be it less," replied sancho; "though i
can tell senor carrasco that my master would not throw the kingdom he
might give me into a sack all in holes; for i have felt my own pulse and
i find myself sound enough to rule kingdoms and govern islands; and i
have before now told my master as much."

their souls, as i have. nay, only look at my disposition, is that likely
to show ingratitude to anyone?"

"god grant it," said don quixote; "we shall see when the government
comes; and i seem to see it already."

he then begged the bachelor, if he were a poet, to do him the favour of
composing some verses for him conveying the farewell he meant to take of
his lady dulcinea del toboso, and to see that a letter of her name was
placed at the beginning of each line, so that, at the end of the verses,
"dulcinea del toboso" might be read by putting together the first
letters. the bachelor replied that although he was not one of

e required verses; though he saw a great difficulty in
the task, as the letters which made up the name were seventeen; so, if he
made four ballad stanzas of four lines each, there would be a letter
over, and if he made them of five, what they called decimas or
redondillas, there were three letters short; nevertheless he would try to
drop a letter as well as he could, so that the name "dulcinea del toboso"
might be got into four ballad stanzas.

"it must be, by some means or other," said don quixote, "for unless the
name stands there plain and manifest, no woman would believe the verses
were made for her."

they agreed upon this, and that the departure should take place in three
days from that time. don quixote charged the bachelor to keep it a
secret, especially from the curate and master nicholas, and from his
niece and the housekeeper, lest they should prevent the execution of his
praiseworthy and valiant purpose. carrasco promised all, and then took
his leave, charging don qui

to which he replied, "wife, if it were god's will, i should be very glad
not to be so well pleased as i show myself."

"i don't understand you, husband," said she, "and i don't know what you
mean by saying you would be glad, if it were god's will, not to be well
pleased; for, fool as i am, i don't know how one can find pleasure in not
having it."

"hark ye, teresa," replied sancho, "i am glad because i have made up my
mind to go back to the service of my master don quixote, who means to go
out a third time to seek for adventures; and i am going with him again,
for my necessities will have it so, and also the hope that cheers me with
the thought that i may find another hundred crowns like those we have
spent; though it makes me sad to have to leave thee and the children; and
if god would be pleased to let me have my daily bread, dry-shod and at

do it at small cost by merely willing it

"i declare thou hast a devil of some sort in thy body!" said sancho. "god

she already saw sanchica dead and buried.

sancho consoled her by saying that though he must make her a countess, he
would put it off as long as possible. here their conversation came to an
end, and sancho went back to see don quixote, and make arrangements for
their departure.

of what took place between don quixote and his niece and housekeeper; one
of the most important chapters in the whole history


while sancho panza and his wife, teresa cascajo, held the above
irrelevant conversation, don quixote's niece and housekeeper were not
idle, for by a thousand signs they began to perceive that their uncle and
master meant to give them the slip the third time, and once more betake
himself to his

n unlucky scheme; but it
was all preaching in the desert and hammering cold iron. nevertheless,
among many other representations made to him, the housekeeper said to
him, "in truth, master, if you do not keep still and stay quiet at home,
and give over roaming mountains and valleys like a troubled spirit,
looking for what they say are called adventures, but what i call
misfortunes, i shall have to make complaint to god and the king with loud
supplication to send some remedy."

to which don quixote replied, "what answer god will give to your
complaints, housekeeper, i know not, nor what his majesty will answer
either; i only know that if i were king i should decline to answer the
numberless silly petitions they present every day; for one of the
greatest among the many troubles kings have is being obliged to listen to
all and answer all, and therefore i should be sorry that any affairs of
mine should worry him."

whereupon the housekeeper said, "tell us, senor, at his majesty's cou

are there no knights?"

"there are," replied don quixote, "and plenty of them; and it is right
there should be, to set off the dignity of the prince, and for the
greater glory of the king's majesty."

"then might not your worship," said she, "be one of those that, without
stirring a step, serve their king and lord in his court?"

"recollect, my friend," said don quixote, "all knights cannot be
courtiers, nor can all courtiers be knights-errant, nor need they be.
there must be all sorts in the world; and though we may be all knights,
there is a great difference between one and another; for the courtiers,
without quitting their chambers, or the threshold of the court, range the
world over by looking at a map, without its costing them a farthing, and
without suffering heat or cold, hunger or thirst; but we, the true
knights-errant, measure the whole earth

 we read in their histories, there have been some among them who
have been the salvation, not merely of one kingdom, but of many."

"ah, senor," here exclaimed the niece, "remember that all this you are
saying about knights-errant is fable and fiction; and their histories, if
indeed they were not burned, would deserve, each of them, to have a
sambenito put on it, or some mark by which it might be known as infamous
and a corrupter of good manners."

"by the god that gives me life," said don quixote, "if thou wert not my
full niece, being daughter of my own sister, i would inflict a
chastisement upon thee for the blasphemy thou hast uttered that all the
world should ring with. what! can it be that a young hussy that hardly
knows how to handle a dozen lace-bobbins dares to wag her tongue and
criticise the histories of knights-errant? what would senor amadis say if
he heard of such a thing? he, however, no doubt would forgive thee, for
he was the most humble-minded and courteous knigh

life, but in that which has no end; i know, as our great castilian poet
says, that--

it is by rugged paths like these they go
that scale the heights of immortality,
unreached by those that falter here below."

"woe is me!" exclaimed the niece, "my lord is a poet, too! he knows
everything, and he can do everything; i will bet, if he chose to turn
mason, he could make a house as easily as a cage."

"i can tell you, niece," replied don quixote, "if these chivalrous
thoughts did not engage all my faculties, there would be nothing that i
could not do, nor any sort of knickknack that would not come from my
hands, particularly cages and tooth-picks."

at this moment there came a knocking at the door, and when they asked who
was there, sancho panza made answer that it was he. the instant the
housekeeper knew who it was, she ran to hide herself so as not to see
him; in such abhorrence did she hold him. the niece let him in, and his

of what passed between don quixote and his squire, together with other
very notable incidents


the instant the housekeeper saw sancho panza shut himself in with her
master, she guessed what they were about; and suspecting that the result
of the consultation would be a resolve to undertake a third sally, she
seized her mantle, and in deep anxiety and distress, ran to find the
bachelor samson carrasco, as she thought that, being a well-spoken man,
and a new friend of her master's, he might be able to persuade him to

skull; so that to bring him round again, ever so little, cost me more
than six hundred eggs, as god knows, and all the world, and my hens too,
that won't let me tell a lie."

"that i can well believe," replied the bachelor, "for they are so good
and so fat, and so well-bred, that they would not say one thing for
another, though they were to burst for it. in short then, mistress
housekeeper, that is all, and there is nothing the matter, except what it
is feared don quixote may do?"

"no, senor," said she.

"well then," returned the bachelor, "don't be uneasy, but go home in
peace; get me ready something hot for breakfast, and while you are on the
way say the prayer of santa apollonia, that is if you know it; for i will
come presently and you will see miracles."

"woe is me," cried the housekeeper, "is it the prayer of santa apollonia
you would have me say? that would do if it was the toothache my master
had; but it is in the brains, what he has got."

"i know what i am saying, mistress housekeeper; go, and don't set
yourself to argue with me, for you know i am a bachelor of salamanca, and
one can't be more of a bachelor than that," replied carrasco; and with
this the housekeeper retired, and the bachelor went to look for the
curate, and arrange with him what will be told in its proper place.

while don quixote and sancho were shut up together, they had a discussion
which the history records with great precision and scrupulous exactness.
sancho said to his master, "senor, i have educed my wife to let me go
with your worship wherever you choose to take me."

"induced, you should say, sancho," said don quixote; "not educed."

"once or twice, as well as i remember," replied sancho, "i have begged of
your worship not to mend my words, if so be as you understand what i mean
by them; and if you don

"i don't understand thee, sancho," said don quixote at once; "for i know
not what 'i am so focile' means."

"'so focile' means i am so much that way," replied sancho.

"i understand thee still less now," said don quixote.

"well, if you can't understand me," said sancho, "i don't know how to put
it; i know no more, god help me."

"oh, now i have hit it," said don quixote; "thou wouldst say thou art so
docile, tractable, and gentle that thou wilt take what i say to thee, and
submit to what i teach thee."

"i would bet," said sancho, "that from the very first you understood me,
and knew what i meant, but you wanted to put me out that you might hear
me make another couple of dozen blunders."

"may be

so," replied don quixote; "but to come to the point, what does
teresa say?"

"teresa says," replied sancho, "that i should make sure with your
worship, and 'let papers speak and beards be still,' for 'he who binds
does not wrangle,' since one 'take' is better than two 'i'll give
thee's;' and i say a woman's advice is no great thing, and he who won't
take it is a fool."

"and so say i," said don quixote; "continue, sancho my friend; go on; you
talk pearls to-day."

"the fact is," continued sancho, "that, as your worship knows better than
i do, we are all of us liable to death, and to-day we are, and to-morrow
we are not, and the lamb goes as soon as the sheep, and nobody can
promise himself more hours of life in this world than god may be pleased
to give him; for death is deaf, and when it comes to knock at our life's
door, it is always urgent, and neither prayers, nor struggles, nor

and as they tell us from the pulpits every day."

"all that is very true," said don quixote; "but i cannot make out what
thou art driving at."

"what i am driving at," said sancho, "is that your worship settle some
fixed wages for me, to be paid monthly while i am in your service, and
that the same be paid me out of your estate; for i don't care to stand on
rewards which either come late, or ill, or never at all; god help me with
my own. in short, i would like to know what i am to get, be it much or
little; for the hen will lay on one egg, and many littles make a much,

 long as one gains something there is nothing lost. to be sure, if
it should happen (what i neither believe nor expect) that your worship
were to give me that island you have promised me, i am not so ungrateful
nor so grasping but that i would be willing to have the revenue of such
island valued and stopped out of my wages in due promotion."

"sancho, my friend," replied don quixote, "sometimes proportion may be as
good as promotion."

"i see," said sancho; "i'll bet i ought to have said proportion, and not
promotion; but it is no matter, as your worship has understood me."

"and so well understood," returned don quixote, "that i have seen into
the depths of thy thoughts, and know the mark thou art shooting at with
the countless shafts of thy proverbs. look here, sancho, i would readily
fix thy wages if i had ever found any instance in the histories of the

almighty in his infinite power grant that any person or persons, who
would impede or hinder thy third sally, may find no way out of the
labyrinth of their schemes, nor ever accomplish what they most desire!"
and then, turning to the housekeeper, he said, "mistress housekeeper may
just as well give over saying the prayer of santa apollonia, for i know
it is the positive determination of the spheres that senor don quixote
shall proceed to put into execution his new and lofty designs; and i

this knight not to keep the might of his strong arm and the virtue of his
valiant spirit any longer curbed and checked, for by his inactivity he is

orphans, of the honour of virgins, of the aid of widows, and of the
support of wives, and other matters of this kind appertaining, belon

and were it requisite to attend your magnificence as squire, i should

at this, don quixote, turning to sancho, said, "did i not tell thee,
sancho, there would be squires enough and to spare for me? see now who
offers to become one; no less than the illustrious bachelor samson
carrasco, the perpetual joy and delight of the courts of the salamancan
schools, sound in body, discreet, patient under heat or cold, hunger or
thirst, with all the qualifications requisite to make a knight-errant's

m down as one of
the greatest simpletons of modern times; and he said to himself that two
such lunatics as master and man the world had never seen. in fine, don
quixote and sancho embraced one another and made friends, and by the
advice and with the approval of the great carrasco, who was now their
oracle, it was arranged that their departure should take place three days
thence, by which time they could have all that was requisite for the
journey ready, and procure a closed helmet, which don quixote said he
must by all means take. samson offered him one, as he knew a friend of
his who had it would not refuse it to him, though it was more dingy with
rust and mildew than bright and clean like burnished steel.

the curses which both housekeeper and niece poured out on the bachelor
were past counting; they tore their hair, they clawed their faces, and in
the style of the hired mourners that were once in fashion, they raised a
lamentation over the departure of their master and uncle, as

 if it had
been his death. samson's intention in persuading him to sally forth once
more was to do what the history relates farther on; all by the advice of
the curate and barber, with whom he had previously discussed the subject.
finally, then, during those three days, don quixote and sancho provided
themselves with what they considered necessary, and sancho having
pacified his wife, and don quixote his niece and housekeeper, at
nightfall, unseen by anyone except the bachelor, who thought fit to
accompany them half a league out of the village, they set out for el
toboso, don quixote on his good rocinante and sancho on his old dapple,
his alforjas furnished with certain matters in the way of victuals, and
his purse with money that don quixote gave him to meet emergencies.
samson embraced him, and entreated him to let him hear of his good or
evil fortunes, so that he might rejoice ove

began on the plains of montiel; nor is it much that he asks in
consideration of all he promises, and so he goes on to say:

don quixote and sancho were left alone, and the moment samson took his
departure, rocinante began to neigh, and dapple to sigh, which, by both
knight and squire, was accepted as a good sign and a very happy omen;
though, if the truth is to be told, the sighs and brays of dapple were
louder than the neighings of the hack, from which sancho inferred that
his good fortune was to exceed and overtop that of his master, building,
perhaps, upon some judicial astrology that he may have known, though the

said don quixote, "sancho, my friend, night is drawing on upon us as we
go, and more darkly than will allow us to reach el toboso by daylight;
for there i am resolved to go before i engage in another adventure, and
there i shall obtain the blessing and generous permission of the peerless

"so i believe," replied sancho; "but i think it will be difficult for
your worship to speak with her or see her, at any rate where you will be
able to receive her blessing; unless, indeed, she throws it over the wall
of the yard where i saw her the time before, when i took her the letter
that told of the follies and mad things your worship was doing in the
heart of sierra morena."

"didst thou take that for a yard wall, sancho," said don quixote, "where
or at which thou sawest that never sufficiently extolled grace and
beauty? it must have been the gallery, corridor, or portico of some rich
and royal palace."

"it might have been all that," returned sancho, "but to me it looked like
a wall, unless i am short of memory."

"at all events, let us go there, sancho," said don quixote; "for, so that
i see her, it is the same to me whether it be over a wall, or at a
window, or through the chink of a door, or the grate of a garden; f

reason and strength to my heart, so that i shall be unmatched and
unequalled in wisdom and valour."

"well, to tell the truth, senor," said sancho, "when i saw that sun of
the lady dulcinea del toboso, it was not bright enough to throw out beams
at all; it must have been, that as her grace was sifting that wheat i
told you of, the thick dust she raised came before her face like a cloud
and dimmed it."

"what! dost thou still persist, sancho," said don quixote, "in saying,
thinking, believing, and maintaining that my lady dulcinea was sifting
wheat, that being an occupation and task entirely at variance with what
is and should be the employment of persons of distinction, who are
constituted and reserved for other avocations and pursuits that show
their rank a bowshot off? thou hast forgotten, o sancho, those lines of
our poet wherein he paints for us how, in their crystal abodes, those
four nymphs employed themselves who rose from their loved

"that, sancho," returned don quixote, "reminds me of what happened to a
famous poet of our own day, who, having written a bitter satire against
all the courtesan ladies, did not insert or name in it a certain lady of
whom it was questionable whether she was one or not. she, seeing she was
not in the list of the poet, asked him what he had seen in her that he

ur thoughts, indolence by traversing the world in all
directions seeking opportunities of making ourselves, besides christians,
famous knights. such, sancho, are the means by which we reach those
extremes of praise that fair fame carries with it."

"all that your worship has said so far," said sancho, "i have understood
quite well; but still i would be glad if your worship would dissolve a
doubt for me, which has just this minute come into my mind."

"solve, thou meanest, sancho," said don quixote; "say on, in god's name,
and i will answer as well as i can."

"tell me, senor," sancho went on to say, "those julys or augusts, and all
those venturous knights that you say are now dead--where are they now?"

"the heathens," replied don quixote, "are, no doubt, in hell; the
christians, if they were good christians, are either in purgatory or in
heaven."

"very good," said sancho; "but now i want to know--the tombs where the
bodies of those great lords are, have they silver lamps bef

to which don quixote made answer: "the tombs of the heathens were
generally sumptuous temples; the ashes of julius caesar's body were
placed on the top of a stone pyramid of vast size, which they now call in
rome saint peter's needle. the emperor hadrian had for a tomb a castle as
large as a good-sized village, which they called the moles adriani, and
is now the castle of st. angelo in rome. the queen artemisia buried her

the world; bu

t none of these tombs, or of the many others of the
heathens, were ornamented with winding-sheets or any of those other
offerings and tokens that show that they who are buried there are
saints."

"that's the point i'm coming to," said sancho; "and now tell me, which is
the greater work, to bring a dead man to life or to kill a giant?"

"the answer is easy," replied don quixote; "it is a greater work to bring
to life a dead man."

"now i have got you," said sancho; "in that case the fame of them who
bring the dead to life, who give sight to the blind, cure cripples,
restore health to the sick, and before whose tombs there are lamps
burning, and whose chapels are filled with devout folk on their knees
adoring their relics be a better fame in this life and in the other than
that which all the heathen emperors and knights-errant that have ever

"that i grant, too," said don quixote.

"then this fame, these favours, these privileges, or whatever you call
it," said sancho, "belong to the bodies and relics of the saints who,
with the approbation and permission of our holy mother church, have
lamps, tapers, winding-sheets, crutches, pictures, eyes and legs, by
means of which they increase devotion and add to their own christian

"what wouldst thou have me infer from all thou hast said, sancho?" asked
don quixote.

"my meaning is," said sancho, "let us set about becoming saints, and we
shall obtain more quickly the fair fame we are striving after; for you
know, senor, yesterday or the day before yesterday (for it is so lately
one may say so) they canonised and beatified two little barefoot friars,

"all that is true," returned don quixote, "but we cannot all be friars,
and many are the ways by which god takes his own to heaven; chivalry is a
religion, there are sainted knights in glory."

"yes," said sancho, "but i have heard say that there are more friars in
heaven than knights-errant."

"that," said don quixote, "is because those in religious orders are more
numerous than knights."

"the errants are many," said sancho.

"many," replied don quixote, "but few they who deserve the name of
knights."

with these, and

 other discussions of the same sort, they passed that
night and the following day, without anything worth mention happening to
them, whereat don quixote was not a little dejected; but at length the
next day, at daybreak, they descried the great city of el toboso, at the
sight of which don quixote's spirits rose and sancho's fell, for he did
not know dulcinea's house, nor in all his life had he ever seen her, any
more than his master; so that they were both uneasy, the one to see her,
the other at not having seen her, and sancho was at a loss to know what
he was to do when his master sent him to el toboso. in the end, don
quixote made up his mind to enter the city at nightfall, and they waited
until the time came among some oak trees that were near el toboso; and
when the moment t

chapter ix.

wherein is related what will be seen there


'twas at the very midnight hour--more or less--when don quixote and
sancho quitted the wood and entered el toboso. the town was in deep
silence, for all the inhabitants were asleep, and stretched on the broad
of their backs, as the saying is. the night was darkish, though sancho
would have been glad had it been quite dark, so as to find in the
darkness an excuse for his blundering. all over the place nothing was to
be heard except the barking of dogs, which deafened the ears of don
quixote and troubled the heart of sancho. now and then an ass brayed,

gs grunted, cats mewed, and the various noises they made seemed louder
in the silence of the night; all which the enamoured knight took to be of
evil omen; nevertheless he said to sancho, "sancho, my son, lead on to
the palace of dulcinea, it may be that we shall find her awake."

"body of the sun! what palace am i to lead to," said sancho, "when what i
saw her highness in was only a very little house?"

"most likely she had then withdrawn into some small apartment of her
palace," said don quixote, "to amuse herself with damsels, as great
ladies and princesses are accustomed to do."

"senor," said sancho, "if your worship will have it in spite of me that
the house of my lady dulcinea is a palace, is this an hour, think you, to
find the door open; and will it be right for us to go knocking till they
hear us and open the door; making a disturbance and confusion all through
the household? are we going, do you fancy, to the house of our wenches,
like gallants who come and knock and g

o in at any hour, however late it
may be?"

"let us first of all find out the palace for certain," replied don
quixote, "and then i will tell thee, sancho, what we had best do; but
look, sancho, for either i see badly, or that dark mass that one sees
from here should be dulcinea's palace."

"then let your worship lead the way," said sancho, "perhaps it may be so;
though i see it with my eyes and touch it with my hands, i'll believe it
as much as i believe it is daylight now."

don quixote took the lead, and having gone a matter of two hundred paces
he came upon the mass that produced the shade, and found it was a great
tower, and then he perceived that the building in question was no palace,
but the chief church of the town, and said he, "it's the church we have
lit upon, sancho."

"so i see," said sancho, "and god grant we may not light upon our graves;
it is no good sign to find oneself wandering in a graveyard at this time
of night; and that, after my telling your wor

ship, if i don't mistake,
that the house of this lady will be in an alley without an outlet."

"the curse of god on thee for a blockhead!" said don quixote; "where hast
thou ever heard of castles and royal palaces being built in alleys
without an outlet?"

"senor," replied sancho, "every country has a way of its own; perhaps
here in el toboso it is the way to build palaces and grand buildings in
alleys; so i entreat your worship to let me search about among these
streets or alleys before me, and perhaps, in some corner or other, i may
stumble on this palace--and i wish i saw the dogs eating it for leading
us such a dance."

"speak respe

ctfully of what belongs to my lady, sancho," said don
quixote; "let us keep the feast in peace, and not throw the rope after
the bucket."

"i'll hold my tongue," said sancho, "but how am i to take it patiently
when your worship wants me, with only once seeing the house of our
mistress, to know always, and find it in the middle of the night, when
your worship can't find it, who must have seen it thousands of times?"

"thou wilt drive me to desperation, sancho," said don quixote. "look
here, heretic, have i not told thee a thousand times that i have never
once in my life seen the peerless dulcinea or crossed the threshold of
her palace, and that i am enamoured solely by hearsay and by the great
reputation she bears for beauty and discretion?"

"i hear it now," returned sancho; "and i may tell you that if you have
not seen her, no more have i."

"that cannot be," said don quixote, "for, at any rate, thou saidst, on
bringing back the answer to the letter i sent

 by thee, that thou sawest
her sifting wheat."

"don't mind that, senor," said sancho; "i must tell you that my seeing
her and the answer i brought you back were by hearsay too, for i can no
more tell who the lady dulcinea is than i can hit the sky."

"sancho, sancho," said don quixote, "there are times for jests and times
when jests are out of place; if i tell thee that i have neither seen nor
spoken to the lady of my heart, it is no reason why thou shouldst say
thou hast not spoken to her or seen her, when the contrary is the case,
as thou well knowest."

while the two were engaged in this conversation, they perceived some one
with a pair of mules approaching the spot where they stood, and from the
noise the plough made, as it dragged along the ground, they guessed

to be some labourer who had got up before daybreak to go to his work, and
so it proved to be. he came along singing the ballad that says--

ill did ye fare, ye men of france, in roncesvalles chase--

"may i die, sancho," said don quixote, when he heard him, "if any good
will come to us tonight! dost thou not hear what that clown is singing?"

"i do," said sancho, "but what has roncesvalles chase to do with what we
have in hand? he might just as well be singing the ballad of calainos,
for any good or ill that can come to us in our business."

by this time the labourer had come up, and don quixote asked him, "can
you tell me, worthy friend, and god speed you, whereabouts here is the
palace of the peerless princess dona d

ork for a rich farmer. in that house
opposite there live the curate of the village and the sacristan, and both
or either of them will be able to give your worship some account of this
lady princess, for they have a list of all the people of el toboso;
though it is my belief there is not a princess living in the whole of it;
many ladies there are, of quality, and in her own house each of them may
be a princess."

"well, then, she i am inquiring for will be one of these, my friend,"
said don quixote.

"may be so," replied the lad; "god be with you, for here comes the
daylight;" and without waiting for any more of his questions, he whipped
on his mules.

sancho, seeing his master downcast and somewhat dissatisfied, said to
him, "senor, daylight will be here before long, and it will not do for us
to let the sun find us in the street; it will be better for us to quit
the city, and for your worship to hide in some forest in the
neighbourhood, and i will come back in the daytime, and

i won't leave a
nook or corner of the whole village that i won't search for the house,
castle, or palace, of my lady, and it will be hard luck for me if i don't
find it; and as soon as i have found it i will speak to her grace, and
tell her where and how your worship is waiting for her to arrange some
plan for you to see her without any damage to her honour and reputation."

"sancho," said don quixote, "thou hast delivered a thousand sentences
condensed in the compass of a few words; i thank thee for the advice thou
hast given me, and take it most gladly. come, my son, let us go look for
some place where i may hide, while thou dost return, as thou sayest, to
seek, and speak with my lady, from whose discretion and courtesy i look
for favours more than miraculous."

sancho was in a fever to get his master out of the town, lest he should
discover the falsehood of the reply he had brough

took at once, and two miles out of the village they found a forest or

the city to speak to dulcinea, in which embassy things befell him which
demand fresh attention and a new chapter.

under the same fear and apprehension, he has recorded it without adding

his story, he says that as soon as don quixote had ensconced himself in
the forest, oak grove, or wood near el toboso, he bade sancho return to
the city, and not come into his presence again without having first
spoken on his behalf to his lady, and begged of her that it might be her
good pleasure to permit herself to be seen by her enslaved knight, and
deign to bestow her blessing upon him, so that he might thereby hope for
a happy issue in all his encounters and difficult enterprises. sancho
undertook to execute the task according

to the instructions, and to bring
back an answer as good as the one he brought back before.

"go, my son," said don quixote, "and be not dazed when thou findest
thyself exposed to the light of that sun of beauty thou art going to
seek. happy thou, above all the squires in the world! bear in mind, and
let it not escape thy memory, how she receives thee; if she changes

shouldst thou haply find her seated in the sumptuous state chamber proper
to her rank; and should she be standi

no bigger than a hazel nut; remember what they say, that a stout heart
breaks bad luck, and that where there are no fletches there are no pegs;
and moreover they say, the hare jumps up where it's not looked for. i say
this because, if we could not find my lady's palaces or castles to-night,
now that it is daylight i count upon finding them when i least expect it,
and once found, leave it to me to manage her."

"verily, sancho," said don quixote, "thou dost always bring in thy
proverbs happily, whatever we deal with; may god give me better luck in
what i am anxious about."

with this, sancho wheeled about and gave dapple the stick, and don
quixote remained behind, seated on his horse, resting in his stirrups and
leaning on the end of his lance, filled with sad and troubled
forebodings; and there we will leave him, and accompany sancho, who went
off no less serious and troubled than he left his master; so much so,
that as soon

as he had got out of the thicket, and looking round saw that
don quixote was not within sight, he dismounted from his ass, and seating
himself at the foot of a tree began to commune with himself, saying,
"now, brother sancho, let us know where your worship is going. are you
going to look for some ass that has been lost? not at all. then what are
you going to look for? i am going to look for a princess, that's all; and
in her for the sun of beauty and the whole heaven at once. and where do
you expect to find all this, sancho? where? why, in the great city of el

toboso. well, and for whom are you going to look for her? for the famous
knight don quixote of la mancha, who rights wrongs, gives food to those
who thirst and drink to the hungry. that's all very well, but do you know
her house, sancho? my master says it will be some royal palace or grand
castle. and have you ever seen her by any chance? neither i nor my master
ever saw her. and does it strike you that it would be just and right if
the el toboso people, finding out that you were here with the intention
of going to tamper with their princesses and trouble their ladies, were

he spied, coming from el toboso towards the spot where he stood, three
peasant girls on three colts, or fillies--for the author does not make
the point clear, though it is more likely they were she-asses, the usual
mount with village girls; but as it is of no great consequence, we need
not stop to prove it.

to be brief, the instant sancho saw the peasant girls, he returned full
speed to seek his master, and found him sighing and uttering a thousand
passionate lamentations. when don quixote saw him he exclaimed, "what
news, sancho, my friend? am i to mark this day with a white stone or a
black?"

"your worship," replied sancho, "had better mark it with ruddle, like the
inscriptions on the walls of class rooms, that those who see it may see
it plain."

"then thou bringest good news," said don quixote.

"so good," replied sancho, "that your worship has only to spur rocinante
and get out into the open field to see the lady dulcinea del toboso, who,
with two others, damsel

he truth or
not? come, senor, push on, and you will see the princess our mistress
coming, robed and adorned--in fact, like what she is. her damsels and she
are all one glow of gold, all bunches of pearls, all diamonds, all
rubies, all cloth of brocade of more than ten borders; with their hair
loose on their shoulders like so many sunbeams playing with the wind; and
moreover, they come mounted on three piebald cackneys, the finest sight
ever you saw."

"hackneys, you mean, sancho," said don quixote.

"there is not much difference between cackneys and hackneys," said
sancho; "but no matter what they come on, there they are, the finest
ladies one could wish for, especially my lady the princess dulcinea, who
staggers one's senses."

"let us go, sancho, my son," said don quixote, "and in guerdon of this
news, as unexpected as it is good, i bestow upon thee the best spoil i
shall win in the first adventure i may have; or if that does not satisfy
thee, i promise thee the foals i shall

 have this year from my three mares
that thou knowest are in foal on our village common."

"i'll take the foals," said sancho; "for it is not quite certain that the
spoils of the first adventure will be good ones."

by this time they had cleared the wood, and saw the three village lasses
close at hand. don quixote looked all along the road to el toboso, and as
he could see nobody except the three peasant girls, he was completely
puzzled, and asked sancho if it was outside the city he had left them.

"how outside the city?" returned sancho. "are your worship's eyes in the
back of your head, that you can't see that they are these who are coming
here, shining like the very sun at noonday?"

"i see nothing, sancho," said don quixote, "but three country girls on
three jackasses."

"now, may god del

iver me from the devil!" said sancho, "and can it be
that your worship takes three hackneys--or whatever they're called-as
white as the driven snow, for jackasses? by the lord, i could tear my
beard if that was the case!"

"well, i can only say, sancho, my friend," said don quixote, "that it is
as plain they are jackasses--or jennyasses--as that i am don quixote, and
thou sancho panza: at any rate, they seem to me to be so."

"hush, senor," said sancho, "don't talk that way, but open your eyes, and
come and pay your respects to the lady of your thoughts, who is close
upon us now;" and with these words he advanced to receive the three
village lasses, and dismounting from dapple, caught hold of one of the
asses of the three country girls by the halter, and dropping on both
knees on the ground, he said, "queen and princess and duchess of beauty,

may it please your haughtiness and greatness to receive into your favour
and good-will your captive knight who stands there turned into marble

magnificent presence. i am sancho panza, his squire, and he the vagabond
knight don quixote of la mancha, otherwise called 'the knight of the
rueful countenance.'"

don quixote had by this time placed himself on his knees beside sancho,
and, with eyes starting out of his head and a puzzled gaze, was regarding
her whom sancho called queen and lady; and as he could see nothing in her
except a village lass, and not a very well-favoured one, for she was
platter-faced and snub-nosed, he was perplexed and bewildered, and did
not venture to open his lips. the country girls, at the same time, were
astonished to see these two men, so different in appearance, on their

is not your magnanimous heart softened by seeing the pillar and prop of
knight-errantry on his knees before your sublimated presence?"

on hearing this, one of the others exclaimed, "woa then! why, i'm rubbing
thee down, she-ass of my father-in-law! see how the lordlings come to
make game of the village girls now, as if we here could not chaff as well
as themselves. go your own way, and let us go ours, and it will be better
for you."

"get up, sancho," said don quixote at this; "i see that fortune, 'with
evil done to me unsated still,' has taken possession of all the roads by
which any comfort may reach 'this wretched soul' that i carry in my
flesh. and thou, highest perfection of excellence that can be desired,

that adores thee, though the malign enchanter that persecutes me has
brought clouds and cataracts on my eyes, and to them, and them only,

e way and let us pass, and we'll thank you."

sancho stood aside and let her go, very well pleased to have got so well
out of the hobble he was in. the instant the village lass who had done
duty for dulcinea found herself free, prodding her "cackney" with a spike
she had at the end of a stick, she set off at full speed across the
field. the she-ass, however, feeling the point more acutely than usual,
began cutting such capers, that it flung the lady dulcinea to the ground;
seeing which, don quixote ran to raise her up, and sancho to fix and
girth the pack-saddle, which also had slipped under the ass's belly. the
pack-saddle being secured, as don quixote was about to lift up his
enchanted mistress in his arms and put her upon her beast, the lady,
getting up from the ground, saved him the trouble, for, going back a
little, she took a short run, and putting both hands on the croup of the
ass she dropped into the saddle more lightly than a falcon, and sat
astride like a man, whereat sa

ncho said, "rogue! but our lady is lighter
than a lanner, and might teach the cleverest cordovan or mexican how to
mount; she cleared the back of the saddle in one jump, and without spurs
she is making the hackney go like a zebra; and her damsels are no way
behind her, for they all fly like the wind;" which was the truth, for as
soon as they saw dulcinea mounted, they pushed on after her, and sped
away without looking back, for more than half a league.

don quixote followed them with his eyes, and when they were no longer in
sight, he turned to sancho and said, "how now, sancho? thou seest how i
am hated by enchanters! and see to what a length the malice and spite
they bear me go, when they seek to deprive me of the happiness it would
give me to see my lady in her own proper form. the fact is i was born to
be an example of misfortune, and the target and mark at which the arrows
of adversity are aimed and directed. observe too, sancho, that these

ir to foul, without meddling with her smell; for by that
we might somehow have found out what was hidden underneath that ugly
rind; though, to tell the truth, i never perceived her ugliness, but only
her beauty, which was raised to the highest pitch of perfection by a mole
she had on her right lip, like a moustache, with seven or eight red hairs
like threads of gold, and more than a palm long."

"from the correspondence which exists between those of the face and those
of the body," said don quixote, "dulcinea must have another mole
resembling that on the thick of the thigh on that side on which she has
the one on her face; but hairs of the length thou hast mentioned are very
long for moles."

"well, all i can say is there they were as plain as could be," replied
sancho.

"i believe it, my friend," returned don quixote; "for nature bestowed
nothing on dulcinea that was not perfect and well-finished; and so, if
she had a hundred moles like the one thou hast described, in her they

would not be moles, but moons and shining stars. but tell me, sancho,
that which seemed to me to be a pack-saddle as thou wert fixing it, was
it a flat-saddle or a side-saddle?"

"it was neither," replied sancho, "but a jineta saddle, with a field
covering worth half a kingdom, so rich is it."

"and that i could not see all this, sancho!" said don quixote; "once more
i say, and will say a thousand times, i am the most unfortunate of men."

sancho, the rogue, had enough to do to hide his laughter, at hearing the
simplicity of the master he had so nicely befooled. at length, after a
good deal more conversation had passed between them, they remounted their
beasts, and followed the road to saragossa, which they expected to reach
in time to take part in a certain grand festival which is held every year
in that illustrious city; but before the

of the strange adventure which the valiant don quixote had with the car
or cart of "the cortes of death"


dejected beyond measure did don quixote pursue his journey, turning over
in his mind the cruel trick the enchanters had played him in changing his
lady dulcinea into the vile shape of the village lass, nor could he think
of any way of restoring her to her original form; and these reflections
so absorbed him, that without being aware of it he let go rocinante's
bridle, and he, perceiving the liberty that was granted him, stopped at
every step to crop the fresh grass with which the plain abounded.

sancho recalled him from his

gallant spirit that knights-errant ought to have. what the devil is this?
what weakness is this? are we here or in france? the devil fly away with
all the dulcineas in the world; for the well-being of a single
knight-errant is of more consequence than all the enchantments and
transformations on earth."

"hush, sancho," said don quixote in a weak and faint voice, "hush and
utter no blasphemies against that enchanted lady; for i alone am to blame
for her misfortune and hard fate; her calamity has come of the hatred the
wicked bear me."

"so say i," returned sancho; "his heart rend in twain, i trow, who saw
her once, to see her now."

"thou mayest well say that, sancho," replied don quixote, "as thou sawest
her in the full perfection of her beauty; for the enchantment does not go

worship conquers some giant, or some other knight, and orders him to go
and present himself before the beauty of the lady dulcinea. where is this
poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find her? i
think i can see them wandering all over el toboso, looking like noddies,
and asking for my lady dulcinea; and even if they meet her in the middle
of the street they won't know her any more than they would my father."

"perhaps, sancho," returned don quixote, "the enchantment does not go so
far as to deprive conquered and presented giants and knights of the power
of recognising dulcinea; we will try by experiment with one or two of the
first i vanquish and send to her, whether they see her or not, by
commanding them to return and give me an account of what happened to them
in this respect."

"i declare, i think what your worship has proposed is excellent," said
sancho; "and that by this plan we shall find out what we want to know;

misfortune will be more yours than hers; but so long as the lady dulcinea
is well and happy, we on our part will make the best of it, and get on as
well as we can, seeking our adventures, and leaving time to take his own
course; for he is the best physician for these and greater ailments."

don quixote was about to reply to sancho panza, but he was prevented by a
cart crossing the road full of the most diverse and strange personages
and figures that could be imagined. he who led the mules and acted as
carter was a hideous demon; the cart was open to the sky, without a tilt
or cane roof, and the first figure that presented itself to don quixote's
eyes was that of death itself with a human face; next to it was an angel
with large painted wings, and at one side an emperor, with a crown, to

all appearance of gold, on his head. at the feet of death was the god
called cupid, without his bandage, but with his bow, quiver, and arrows;
there was also a knight in full armour, except that he had no morion or
helmet, but only a hat decked with plumes of divers colours; and along
with these there were others with a variety of costumes and faces. all
this, unexpectedly encountered, took don quixote somewhat aback, and
struck terror into the heart of sancho; but the next instant don quixote
was glad of it, believing that some new perilous adventure was presenting
itself to him, and under this impression, and with a spirit prepared to

and menacing tone, exclaimed, "carter, or coachman, or devil, or whatever
thou art, tell me at once who thou art, whither thou art going, and who
these folk are thou carriest in thy wagon, which looks more like charon's
boat than an ordinary cart."

the utmost exactitude, for as i am a devil i am up to everything."

"by the faith of a knight-errant," replied don quixote, "when i saw this

declare one must touch with the hand what appears to the eye, if
illusions are to be avoided. god speed you, good people; keep your

e company in a
mummers' dress with a great number of bells, and armed with three blown
ox-bladders at the end of a stick, joined them, and this merry-andrew
approaching don quixote, began flourishing his stick and banging the
ground with the bladders and cutting capers with great jingling of the
bells, which untoward apparition so startled rocinante that, in spite of
don quixote's efforts to hold him in, taking the bit between his teeth he
set off across the plain with greater speed than the bones of his anatomy
ever gave any promise of.

sancho, who thought his master was in danger of being thrown, jumped off
dapple, and ran in all haste to help him; but by the time he reached him
he was already on the ground, and beside him was rocinante, who had come
down with his master, the usual end and upshot of rocinante's vivacity
and high spirits. but the moment sanch

don quixote, the dancing devil with the bladders jumped up on dapple, and
beating him with them, more by the fright and the noise than by the pain
of the blows, made him fly across the fields towards the village where
they were going to hold their festival. sancho witnessed dapple's career
and his master's fall, and did not know which of the two cases of need he
should attend to first; but in the end, like a good squire and good
servant, he let his love for his master prevail over his affection for

his ass; though every time he saw the bladders rise in the air and come
down on the hind quarters of his dapple he felt the pains and terrors of
death, and he would have rather had the blows fall on the apples of his
own eyes than on the least hair of his ass's tail. in this trouble and
perplexity he came to where don quixote lay in a far sorrier plight than
he liked, and having helped him to mount rocinante, he said to him,
"senor, the devil has carried off my dapple."

"what devil?" asked don quixote.

"the one with the bladders," said sancho.

"then i will recover him," said don quixote, "even if he be shut up with
him in the deepest and darkest dungeons of hell. follow me, sancho, for
the cart goes slowly, and with the mules of it i will make good the loss
of dapple."

"you need not take the trouble

, senor," said sancho; "keep cool, for as i
now see, the devil has let dapple go and he is coming back to his old
quarters;" and so it turned out, for, having come down with dapple, in
imitation of don quixote and rocinante, the devil made off on foot to the
town, and the ass came back to his master.

"for all that," said don quixote, "it will be well to visit the
discourtesy of that devil upon some of those in the cart, even if it were
the emperor himself."

"don't think of it, your worship," returned sancho; "take my advice and
never meddle with actors, for they are a favoured class; i myself have
known an actor taken up for two murders, and yet come off scot-free;
remember that, as they are merry folk who give pleasure, everyone favours
and protects them, and helps and makes much of them, above all when they

dress and appearance look like princes."

"still, for all that," said don quixote, "the player devil must not go
off boasting, even if the whole human race favours him."

so saying, he made for the cart, which was now very near the town,
shouting out as he went, "stay! halt! ye merry, jovial crew! i want to
teach you how to treat asses and animals that serve the squires of
knights-errant for steeds."

so loud were the shouts of don quixote, that those in the cart heard and
understood them, and, guessing by the words what the speaker's intention
was, death in an ins

tant jumped out of the cart, and the emperor, the
devil carter and the angel after him, nor did the queen or the god cupid
stay behind; and all armed themselves with stones and formed in line,
prepared to receive don quixote on the points of their pebbles. don
quixote, when he saw them drawn up in such a gallant array with uplifted
arms ready for a mighty discharge of stones, checked rocinante and began
to consider in what way he could attack them with the least danger to
himself. as he halted sancho came up, and seeing him disposed to attack
this well-ordered squadron, said to him, "it would be the height of
madness to attempt such an enterprise; remember, senor, that against sops

w oneself away under a brass bell; and besides, one
should remember that it is rashness, and not valour, for a single man to
attack an army that has death in it, and where emperors fight in person,
with angels, good and bad, to help them; and if this reflection will not
make you keep quiet, perhaps it will to know for certain that among all
these, though they look like kings, princes, and emperors, there is not a
single knight-errant."

"now indeed thou hast hit the point, sancho," said don quixote, "which
may and should turn me from the resolution i had already formed. i cannot
and must not draw sword, as i have many a time before told thee, against
anyone who is not a dubbed knight; it is for thee, sancho, if thou wilt,
to take vengeance for the wrong done to thy dapple; and i will help thee
from here by shouts and salutary counsels."

"there is no occasion to take vengeance on anyone, senor," replied
sancho; "for it is not the part of good christians to revenge wrongs; and

good-will and pleasure, and that is to live in peace as long as heaven

"well," said don quixote, "if that be thy determination, good sancho,
sensible sancho, christian sancho, honest sancho, let us leave these
phantoms alone and turn to the pursuit of better and worthier adventures;
for, from what i see of this country, we cannot fail to find plenty of
marvellous ones in it."

he at once wheeled about, sancho ran to take possession of his dapple,
death and his flying squadron returned to their cart and pursued their
journey, and thus the dread adventure of the cart of death ended

of the strange adventure which befell the valiant don quixote with the
bold knight of the mirrors


the night succeeding the day of the encounter with death, don quixote and
his squire passed under some tall shady trees, and don quixote at
sancho's persuasion ate a little from the store carried by dapple, and
over their supper sancho said to his master, "senor, what a fool i should
have looked if i had chosen for my reward the spoils of the first
adventure your worship achieved, instead of the foals of the three mares.
after all, 'a sparrow in the hand is better than a vulture on the wing.'"

"at the same time, sancho," replied don quixote, "if thou hadst let me
attack them as i wanted, at the very least the emperor's

have taken them by force and given them into thy hands."

"the sceptres and crowns of those play-actor emperors," said sancho,
"were never yet pure gold, but only brass foil or tin."

"that is true," said don quixote, "for it would not be right that the
accessories of the drama should be real, instead of being mere fictions
and semblances, like the drama itself; towards which, sancho-and, as a
necessary consequence, towards those who represent and produce it--i
would that thou wert favourably disposed, for they are all instruments of
great good to the state, placing before us at every step a mirror in
which we may see vividly displayed what goes on in human life; nor is

to be than the play and the players. come, tell me, hast thou not seen a
play acted in which kings, emperors, pontiffs, knights, ladies, and
divers other personages were introduced? one plays the villain, another
the knave, this one the merchant, that the soldier, one the sharp-witted
fool, another the foolish lover; and when the play is over, and they have
put off the dresses they wore in it, all the actors become equal."

"yes, i have seen that," said sancho.

"well then," said don quixote, "the same thing happens in the comedy and
life of this world, where some play emperors, others popes, and, in
short, all the characters that can be brought into a play; but when it is
over, that is to say when life ends, death strips them all of the
garments that distinguish one from the other, and all are equal in the
grave."

"a fine comparison!" said sancho; "though not so new but that i have
heard it many and many a time, as well as that other one of the game of
chess; how, so lon

office, and when the game is finished they are all mixed, jumbled up and

life in the grave."

"thou art growing less doltish and more shrewd every day, sancho," said
don quixote.

"ay," said sancho; "it must be that some of your worship's shrewdness
sticks to me; land that, of itself, is barren and dry, will come to yield
good fruit if you dung it and till it; what i mean is that your worship's
conversation has been the dung that has fallen on the barren soil of my
dry wit, and the time i have been in your service and society has been
the tillage; and with the help of this i hope to yield fruit in abundance
that will not fall away or slide from those paths of g

don quixote laughed at sancho's affected phraseology, and perceived that
what he said about his improvement was true, for now and then he spoke in
a way that surprised him; though always, or mostly, when sancho tried to
talk fine and attempted polite language, he wound up by toppling over
from the summit of his simplicity into the abyss of his ignorance; and
where he showed his culture and his memory to the greatest advantage was
in dragging in proverbs, no matter whether they had any bearing or not

and let no one fancy that the author was at all astray when he compared
the friendship of these animals to that of men; for men have received
many lessons from beasts, and learned many important things, as, for
example, the clyster from the stork, vomit and gratitude from the dog,
watchfulness from the crane, foresight from the ant, modesty from the
elephant, and loyalty from the horse.

sancho at last fell asleep at the foot of a cork tree, while don quixote
dozed at that of a sturdy oak; but a short time only had elapsed when a
noise he heard behind him awoke him, and rising up startled, he listened
and looked in the direction the noise came from, and perceived two men on
horseback, one of whom, letting himself drop from the saddle, said to the
other, "dismount, my friend, and take the bridles off the horses, for, so
far as i can see, this place will furnish grass for them, and the
solitude and silence my love-sick thoughts need of." as he

stretched himself upon the ground, and as he flung himself down, the
armour in which he was clad rattled, whereby don quixote perceived that
he must be a knight-errant; and going over to sancho, who was asleep, he
shook him by the arm and with no small difficulty brought him back to his
senses, and said in a low voice to him, "brother sancho, we have got an
adventure."

"god send us a good one," said sancho; "and where may her ladyship the
adventure be?"

"where, sancho?" replied don quixote; "turn thine eyes and look, and thou

ove happy, for i saw him fling himself off his horse and throw
himself on the ground with a certain air of dejection, and his armour

"well," said sancho, "how does your worship make out that to be an
adventure?"

"i do not mean to say," returned don quixote, "that it is a complete
adventure, but that it is the beginning of one, for it is in this way
adventures begin. but listen, for it seems he is tuning a lute or guitar,
and from the way he is spitting and clearing his chest he must be getting
ready to sing something."

"faith, you are right," said sancho, "and no doubt he is some enamoured
knight."

"there is no knight-errant that is not," said don quixote; "but let us

most ungrateful woman on earth! what! can it be, most serene casildea de

perish in ceaseless wanderings and rude and arduous toils? it is not
enough that i have compelled all the knights of navarre, all the leonese,
all the tartesians, all the castilians, and finally all the knights of la
mancha, to confess thee the most beautiful in the world?"

"not so," said don quixote at this, "for i am of la mancha, and i have
never confessed anything of the sort, nor could i nor should i confess a
thing so much to the prejudice of my lady's beauty; thou seest how this
knight is raving, sancho. but let us listen, perhaps he will tell us more
about himself."

"that he will," returned sancho, "for he seems in a mood to bewail
himself for a month at a stretch."

but this was not the case, for the knight of the grove, hearing voices
near him, instead of continuing his

 lamentation, stood up and exclaimed
in a distinct but courteous tone, "who goes there? what are you? do you
belong to the number of the happy or of the miserable?"

"of the miserable," answered don quixote.

"then come to me," said he of the grove, "and rest assured that it is to
woe itself and affliction itself you come."

don quixote, finding himself answered in such a soft and courteous
manner, went over to him, and so did sancho.

the doleful knight took don quixote by the arm, saying, "sit down here,
sir knight; for, that you are one, and of those that profess
knight-errantry, it is to me a sufficient proof to have found you in this
place, where solitude and night, the natural couch and proper retreat of
knights-errant, keep you company." to which don made answer, "a knight i
am of the profession you mention, and though sorrows, misfortunes, and
calamities have made my heart their abode, the compassion i feel for the

in the meantime, they had seated themselves together on the hard ground
peaceably and sociably, just as if, as soon as day broke, they were not
going to break one another's heads.

"are you, sir knight, in love perchance?" asked he of the grove of don
quixote.

"by mischance i am," replied don quixote; "though the ills arising from
well-bestowed affections should be esteemed favours rather than
misfortunes."

"that is true," returned he of the grove, "if scorn did not unsettle our
reason and understanding, for if it be excessive it looks like revenge."

"i was never scorned by my lady," said don quixote.

"certainly not," said sancho, who stood close by, "for my lady is as a
lamb, and softer than a roll of butter."

"is this your squire?" asked he of the grove.

among the things that passed between don quixote and the knight of the

sir knight, i would have you know that my destiny, or, more properly
speaking, my choice led me to fall in love with the peerless casildea de
vandalia. i call her peerless because she has no peer, whether it be in
bodily stature or in the supremacy of rank and beauty. this same
casildea, then, that i speak of, requited my honourable passion and
gentle aspirations by compelling me, as his stepm

that she surpasses all women alive to-day in beauty, and that i am the
most valiant and the most deeply enamoured knight on earth; in support of
which claim i have already travelled over the greater part of spain, and
have there vanquished several knights who have dared to contradict me;
but what i most plume and pride myself upon is having vanquished in
single combat that so famous knight don quixote of la mancha, and made
him confess that my casildea is more beautiful than his dulcinea; and in
this one victory i hold myself to have conquered all the knights in the
world; for this don quixote that i speak of has vanquished them all, and
i having vanquished him, his glory, his fame, and his honour have passed
and are transferred to my person; for

don quixote was amazed when he heard the knight of the grove, and was a
thousand times on the point of telling him he lied, and had the lie
direct already on the tip of his tongue; but he restrained himself as
well as he could, in order to force him to confess the lie with his own
lips; so he said to him quietly, "as to what you say, sir knight, about
having vanquished most of the knights of spain, or even of the whole
world, i say nothing; but that you have vanquished don quixote of la

him, although there are few like him."

"how! not vanquished?" said he of the grove; "by the heaven that is above
us i fought don quixote and overcame him and made him yield; and he is a
man of tall stature, gaunt features, long, lank limbs, with hair turning
grey, an aquiline nose rather hooked, and large black drooping
moustaches; he does battle under the name of 'the countenance,' and he
has for squire a peasant called sancho panza; he presses the loins and
rules the reins of a famous steed called rocinante; and lastly, he has
for the mistress of his will a certain dulcinea del toboso, once upon a
time called aldonza lo

because her name is casilda and she is of andalusia. if all these tokens
are not enough to vindicate the truth of what i say, here is my sword,
that will compel incredulity itself to give credence to it."

"calm yourself, sir knight," said don quixote, "and give ear to what i am
about to say to you. i would have you know that this don quixote you
speak of is the greatest friend i have in the world; so much so that i
may say i regard him in the same light as my own person; and from the
precise and clear indications you have given i cannot but think that he
must be the very one you have vanquished. on the other hand, i see with
my eyes and feel with my hands that it is impossible it can have been the
same; unless indeed it be that, as he has many enemies who are
enchanters, and one in particular who is always persecuting him, s

of these may have taken his shape in order to allow himself to be
vanquished, so as to defraud him of the fame that his exalted
achievements as a knight have earned and acquired for him throughout the
known world. and in confirmation of this, i must tell you, too, that it
is but ten hours since these said enchanters his enemies transformed the
shape and person of the fair dulcinea del toboso into a foul and mean
village lass, and in the same way they must have transformed don quixote;
and if all this does not suffice to convince you of the truth of what i
say, here is don quixote himself, who will maintain it by arms, on foot
or on horseback or in any way you please."

and so saying he stood up and laid his hand on his sword, waiting to see
what the knight of the grove would do, who in an equally calm voice said
in reply, "pledges don't distress a good payer; he who has succeeded in
vanquishing you once when transformed, sir don quixote, may fairly hope

e body. it is, in fact, stated, that
it was of enormous size, hooked in the middle, covered with warts, and of
a mulberry colour like an egg-plant; it hung down two fingers' length
below his mouth, and the size, the colour, the warts, and the bend of it,
made his face so hideous, that sancho, as he looked at him, began to
tremble hand and foot like a child in convulsions, and he vowed in his
heart to let himself be given two hundred buffets, sooner than be
provoked to fight that monster. don quixote examined his adversary, and
found that he already had his helmet on and visor lowered, so that he
could not see his face; he observed, however, that he was a sturdily
built man, but not very tall in stature. over his armour he wore a
surcoat or cassock of what seemed to be the finest cloth of gold, all
bespangled with glittering mirrors like little moons, which gave him an
extremely gallant and splendid appearance; above his helmet fluttered a
great quantity of plumes, green, yellow, and

don quixote observed all, and took note of all, and from what he saw and
observed he concluded that the said knight must be a man of great
strength, but he did not for all that give way to fear, like sancho
panza; on the contrary, with a composed and dauntless air, he said to the
knight of the mirrors, "if, sir knight, your great eagerness to fight has
not banished your courtesy, by it i would entreat you to raise your visor
a little, in order that i may see if the comeliness of your countenance
cor

responds with that of your equipment."

"whether you come victorious or vanquished out of this emprise, sir
knight," replied he of the mirrors, "you will have more than enough time
and leisure to see me; and if now i do not comply with your request, it
is because it seems to me i should do a serious wrong to the fair
casildea de vandalia in wasting time while i stopped to raise my visor
before compelling you to confess what you are already aware i maintain."

"well then," said don quixote, "while we are mounting you can at least
tell me if i am that don quixote whom you said you vanquished."

"to that we answer you," said he of the mirrors, "that you are as like
the very knight i vanquished as one egg is like another, but as you say
enchanters persecute you, i will not venture to say positively whether
you are the said person or not."

"that," said don quixote, "is enough to convince me that you are under a
deception; however, entirely to relieve you of it, let our hors

brought, and in less time than it would take you to raise your visor, if
god, my lady, and my arm stand me in good stead, i shall see your face,
and you shall see that i am not the vanquished don quixote you take me to
be."

with this, cutting short the colloquy, they mounted, and don quixote
wheeled rocinante round in order to take a proper distance to charge back
upon his adversary, and he of the mirrors did the same; but don quixote
had not moved away twenty paces when he heard himself called by the
other, and, each returning half-way, he of the mirrors said to him,
"remember, sir knight, that the terms of our combat are, that the
vanquished, as i said before, shall be at the victor's disposal."

"i am aware of it already," said don quixote; "provided what is commanded
and imposed upon the vanquished be things that do not transgress the
limits of chivalry."

"that is understood," replied he of the mirrors.

this moment the extraordinary nose of the squire presented itself to
don quixote's view, and he was no less amazed than sancho at the sight;
insomuch that he set him down as a monster of some kind, or a human being
of some new species or unearthly breed. sancho, seeing his master
retiring to run his course, did not like to be left alone with the nosy
man, fearing that with one flap of that nose on his own the battle would
be all over for him and he would be left stretched on the ground, either
by the blow or with fright; so he ran after his master, holding on to

about, he said, "i implore of your worship, senor, before you turn to
charge, to help me up into this cork tree, from which i will be able to
witness the gallant encounter your worship is going to have with this
knight, more to my taste and better than from the ground."

"it seems to me rather, sancho," said don quixote, "that thou wouldst
mount a scaffold in order to see the bulls without danger."

"to tell the truth," returned sancho, "the monstrous nose of that squire
has filled me with fear and terror, and i dare not stay near him."

"it is," said don quixote, "such a one that were i not what i am it would
terrify me too; so, come, i will help thee up where thou wilt."

while don quixote waited for sancho to mount into the cork tree he of the
mirrors took as much ground as he considered requisite

, and, supposing
don quixote to have done the same, without waiting for any sound of
trumpet or other signal to direct them, he wheeled his horse, which was
not more agile or better-looking than rocinante, and at his top speed,
which was an easy trot, he proceeded to charge his enemy; seeing him,
however, engaged in putting sancho up, he drew rein, and halted in mid
career, for which his horse was very grateful, as he was already unable
to go. don quixote, fancying that his foe was coming down upon him
flying, drove his spurs vigorously into rocinante's lean flanks and made
him scud along in such style that the history tells us that on this
occasion only was he known to make something like running, for on all
others it was a simple trot with him; and with this unparalleled fury he
bore down where he of the mirrors stood digging his spurs into his horse
up to buttons, without being able to make him stir a finger's length from

e he had come to a standstill in his course. at this lucky
moment and crisis, don quixote came upon his adversary, in trouble with
his horse, and embarrassed with his lance, which he either could not
manage, or had no time to lay in rest. don quixote, however, paid no
attention to these difficulties, and in perfect safety to himself and
without any risk encountered him of the mirrors with such force that he
brought him to the ground in spite of himself over the haunches of his
horse, and with so heavy a fall that he lay to all appearance dead, not
stirring hand or foot. the instant sancho saw him fall he slid down from
the cork tree, and made all haste to where his master was, who,
dismounting from rocinante, went and stood over him

mage of the bachelor samson
carrasco! as soon as he saw it he called out in a loud voice, "make haste
here, sancho, and behold what thou art to see but not to believe; quick,
my son, and learn what magic can do, and wizards and enchanters are
capable of."

sancho came up, and when he saw the countenance of the bachelor carrasco,
he fell to crossing himself a thousand times, and blessing himself as
many more. all this time the prostrate knight showed no signs of life,
and sancho said to don quixote, "it is my opinion, senor, that in any
case your worship should take and thrust your sword into the mouth of
this one here that looks like the bachelor samson carrasco; perhaps in
him you will kill one of your enemies, the enchanters."

"thy advice is not bad," said don quixote, "for of enemies the fewer the
better;" and he was drawing his sword to carry into effect sancho's
counsel and suggestion, when the squire of the mirrors came up, now
without the nose which had made him so hideou

s, and cried out in a loud
voice, "mind what you are about, senor don quixote; that is your friend,
the bachelor samson carrasco, you have at your feet, and i am his
squire."

"and the nose?" said sancho, seeing him without the hideous feature he
had before; to which he replied, "i have it here in my pocket," and
putting his hand into his right pocket, he pulled out a masquerade nose
of varnished pasteboard of the make already described; and sancho,
examining him more and more closely, exclaimed aloud in a voice of
amazement, "holy mary be good to me! isn't it t

am, gossip and friend sancho panza; and i'll tell you presently the means
and tricks and falsehoods by which i have been brought here; but in the
meantime, beg and entreat of your master not to touch, maltreat, wound,
or slay the knight of the mirrors whom he has at his feet; because,
beyond all dispute, it is the rash and ill-advised bachelor samson
carrasco, our fellow townsman."

at this moment he of the mirrors came to himself, and don quixote
perceiving it, held the naked point of his sword over his face, and said
to him, "you are a dead man, knight, unless you confess that the peerless
dulcinea del toboso excels your casildea de vandalia in beauty; and in
addition to this you must promise, if you should survive this encounter
and fall, to go to the city of el toboso and present yourself before her
on my behalf, that she deal with you according to her good pleasure; and
if she leaves you free to do yours, you are in like mann

you and her-conditions which, in accordance with what we stipulated
before our combat, do not transgress the just limits of knight-errantry."

"i confess," said the fallen knight, "that the dirty tattered shoe of the
lady dulcinea del toboso is better than the ill-combed though clean beard
of casildea; and i promise to go and to return from her presence to
yours, and to give you a full and particular account of all you demand of
me."

"you must also confess and believe," added don quixote, "that the knight
you vanquished was not and could not be don quixote of la mancha, but
some one else in his likeness, just as i confess and believe that you,
though you seem to be the bachelor samson carrasco, are not so, but some
other resembling him, whom my enemies have here put before me in his
shape, in order that i may restrain and moderate the vehemence of my
wrath, and make a gentle use of the glory of my victory."

the shock of my fall will allow me, for it has left me in a sorry plight
enough."

don quixote helped him to rise, with the assistance of his squire tom
cecial; from whom sancho never took his eyes, and to whom he put
questions, the replies to which furnished clear proof that he was really
and truly the tom cecial he said; but the impression made on sancho's
mind by what his master said about the enchanters having changed the face
of the knight of the mirrors into that of the bachelor samson carrasco,
would not permit him to believe what he saw with his eyes. in fine, both

out of luck, he of the mirrors and his squire parted from don quixote and
sancho, he meaning to go look for some village where he could plaster and
strap his ribs. don quixote and sancho resumed their journey to
saragossa, and on it the history leaves them in order that it may tell

the said vanquished knight was bound, under the penalty of ceasing to be

for he just then had no thought of anything but finding some village
where he could plaster himself, as has been said already. the history
goes on to say, then, that when the bachelor samson carrasco recommended
don quixote to resume his knight-errantry which he had laid aside, it was

the barber on the means to be adopted to induce don quixote to stay at

adventures; at which consultation it was decided by the unanimous vote of
all, and on the special advice of carrasco, that don quixote should be
allowed to go, as it seemed impossible to restrain him, and that samson
should sally forth to meet him as a knight-errant, and do battle with
him, for there would be no difficulty about a cause, and vanquish him,
that being looked upon as an easy matter; and that it should be agreed
and settled that the vanquished was to be at the mercy of the victor.
then, don quixote being vanquished, the bachelor knight was to command
him to return to his village and his house, and not quit

years, or until he received further orders from him; all which it was
clear don quixote would unhesitatingly obey, rather than contravene or
fail to observe the laws of chivalry; and during the period of his
seclusion he might perhaps forget his folly, or there might be an
opportunity of discovering some ready remedy for his madness. carrasco
undertook the task, and tom cecial, a gossip and neighbour of sancho
panza's, a lively, feather-headed fellow, offered himself as his squire.
carrasco armed himself in the fashion described, and tom cecial, that he

y his gossip when they met, fitted on over his own
natural nose the false masquerade one that has been mentioned; and so
they followed the same route don quixote took, and almost came up with
him in time to be present at the adventure of the cart of death and
finally encountered them in the grove, where all that the sagacious
reader has been reading about took place; and had it not been for the
extraordinary fancies of don quixote, and his conviction that the
bachelor was not the bachelor, senor bachelor would have been
incapacitated for ever from taking his degree of licentiate, all through
not finding nests where he thought to find birds.

tom cecial, seeing how ill they had succeeded, and what a sorry end their
expedition had come to, said to the bachelor, "sure enough, senor samson
carrasco, we are served right; it is easy enough to plan and set about an
enterprise, but it is often a difficult matter to come

and you are left sore and sorry! i'd like to know now which is the
madder, he who is so because he cannot help it, or he who is so of his
own choice?"

to which samson replied, "the difference between the two sorts of madmen
is, that he who is so will he nil he, will be one always, while he who is
so of his own accord can leave off being one whenever he likes."

"in that case," said tom cecial, "i was a madman of my own acco

any wish that he may recover his senses that will make me hunt him out
now, but a wish for the sore pain i am in with my ribs won't let me
entertain more charitable thoughts."

thus discoursing, the pair proceeded until they reached a town where it
was their good luck to find a bone-setter, with whose help the
unfortunate samson was cured. tom cecial left him and went home, while he

chapter xvi.

of what befell don quixote with a discreet gentleman of la mancha


don quixote pursued his journey in the high spirits, satisfaction, and
self-complacency already described, fancying himself the most valorous
knight-errant of the age in the world because of his late victory. all
the adventures that could befall him from that time forth he regarded as
already done and brought to a happy issue; he made light of enchantments
and enchanters; he thought no more of the countless drubbings that had
been administered to him in the course of his knight-errantry, nor of the

 stakes that fell upon him; in short, he said to himself that
could he discover any means, mode, or way of disenchanting his lady
dulcinea, he would not envy the highest fortune that the most fortunate
knight-errant of yore ever reached or could reach.

he was going along entirely absorbed in these fancies, when sancho said
to him, "isn't it odd, senor, that i have still before my eyes that
monstrous enormous nose of my gossip, tom cecial?"

"and dost thou, then, believe, sancho," said don quixote, "that the
knight of the mirrors was the bachelor carrasco, and his squire tom
cecial thy gossip?"

"i don't know what to say to that," replied sancho; "all i know is that
the tokens he gave me about my own house, wife and children, nobody else
but himself could have given me; and the face, once the nose was off, was
the very face of tom cecial, as i have seen it many a time in my town and
next door to my own house; and the sound of the voice was just the same."

"let us reason the ma

tter, sancho," said don quixote. "come now, by what
process of thinking can it be supposed that the bachelor samson carrasco
would come as a knight-errant, in arms offensive and defensive, to fight
with me? have i ever been by any chance his enemy? have i ever given him
any occasion to owe me a grudge? am i his rival, or does he profess arms,
that he should envy the fame i have acquired in them?"

"well, but what are we to say, senor," returned sancho, "about that
knight, whoever he is, being so like the bachelor carr

asco, and his
squire so like my gossip, tom cecial? and if that be enchantment, as your
worship says, was there no other pair in the world for them to take the
likeness of?"

"it is all," said don quixote, "a scheme and plot of the malignant
magicians that persecute me, who, foreseeing that i was to be victorious
in the conflict, arranged that the vanquished knight should display the
countenance of my friend the bachelor, in order that the friendship i
bear him should interpose to stay the edge of my sword and might of my
arm, and temper the just wrath of my heart; so that he who sought to take
my life by fraud and falsehood should save his own. and to prove it, thou

e field and jineta fashion, and of mulberry colour and
green. he carried a moorish cutlass hanging from a broad green and gold
baldric; the buskins were of the same make as the baldric; the spurs were
not gilt, but lacquered green, and so brightly polished that, matching as
they did the rest of his apparel, they looked better than if they had
been of pure gold.

when the traveller came up with them he saluted them courteously, and
spurring his mare was passing them without stopping, but don quixote
called out to him, "gallant sir, if so be your worship is going our road,
and has no occasion for speed, it would be a pleasure to me if we were to
join company."

"in truth," replied he on the mare, "i would not pass you so hastily but
for fear that horse might turn restive in the company of my mare."

"you may safely hold in your mare, senor," said sancho in reply to this,
"for our horse is the most virtuous and well-behaved horse in the world;
he never does anything wrong on such o

ccasions, and the only time he
misbehaved, my master and i suffered for it sevenfold; i say again your
worship may pull up if you like; for if she was offered to him between
two plates the horse would not hanker after her."

the traveller drew rein, amazed at the trim and features of don quixote,
who rode without his helmet, which sancho carried like a valise in front
of dapple's pack-saddle; and if the man in green examined don quixote
closely, still more closely did don quixote examine the man in green, who
struck him as being a man of intelligence. in appearance he was about
fifty years of age, with but few grey hairs, an aquiline cast of
features, and an expression between grave and gay; and his dress and
accoutrements showed him to be a man of good condition. what he in green
thought of don quixote of la mancha was that a man of that sort and shape
he had never yet seen; he marvelled at the length of his hair, his lofty
stature, the lankness and sallowness o

don quixote saw very plainly the attention with which the traveller was
regarding him, and read his curiosity in his astonishment; and courteous
as he was and ready to please everybody, before the other could ask him
any question he anticipated him by saying, "the appearance i present to
your worship being so strange and so out of the common, i should not be
surprised if it filled you with wonder; but you will cease to wonder when
i tell you, as i do, that i am one of those knights who, as people say

proper and natural duty of knights-errant; and, therefore, because of my
many valiant and christian achievements, i have been already found worthy
to make my way in print to well-nigh all, or most, of the nations of the
earth. thirty thousand volumes of my history have been printed, and it is
on the high-road to be printed thirty thousand thousands of times, if
heaven does not put a stop to it. in short, to sum up all in a few words,
or in a single one, i may tell you i am don quixote of la mancha,
otherwise called 'the knight of the rueful countenance;' for though
self-praise is degrading, i must perforce sound my own sometimes, that is
to say, when there is no one at hand to do it for me. so that, gentle
sir, neither this horse, nor this lance, nor this shield, nor this
squire, nor all these arms put together, nor the sallowness of my
countenance, nor my gaunt leanness, will henceforth astonish you, now
that you know who i am and what profession i follow."

hese words don quixote held his peace, and, from the time he took
to answer, the man in green seemed to be at a loss for a reply; after a
long pause, however, he said to him, "you were right when you saw
curiosity in my amazement, sir knight; but you have not succeeded in
removing the astonishment i feel at seeing you; for although you say,
senor, that knowing who you are ought to remove it, it has not done so;
on the contrary, now that i know, i am left more amazed and astonished
than before. what! is it poss

blessed be heaven! for by means of this history of your noble and genuine
chivalrous deeds, which you say has been printed, the countless stories
of fictitious knights-errant with which the world is filled, so much to
the injury of morality and the prejudice and discredit of good histories,
will have been driven into oblivion."

"there is a good deal to be said on that point," said don quixote, "as to
whether the histories of the knights-errant are fiction or not."

"why, is there anyone who doubts that those histories are false?" said
the man in green.

"i doubt it," said don quixote, "but never mind that just now; if our
journey lasts long enough, i trust in god i shall show your worship that
you do wrong in going with the stream of those who regard it as a matter
of certainty that they are not true."

from this last observation of don quixote's, the traveller began to h

a suspicion that he was some crazy being, and was waiting for him to confirm
it by something further; but before they could turn to any new subject
don quixote begged him to tell him who he was, since he himself had
rendered account of his station and life. to this, he in the green gaban
replied "i, sir knight of the rueful countenance, am a gentleman by
birth, native of the village where, please god, we are going to dine
today; i am more than fairly well off, and my name is don diego de
miranda. i pass my life with my wife, children, and friends; my pursuits

sked him, "what are you about, brother? what
are these kisses for?"

"let me kiss," said sancho, "for i think your worship is the first saint
in the saddle i ever saw all the days of my life."

"i am no saint," replied the gentleman, "but a great sinner; but you are,
brother, for you must be a good fellow, as your simplicity shows."

sancho went back and regained his pack-saddle, having extracted a laugh
from his master's profound melancholy, and excited fresh amazement in don
diego. don quixote then asked him how many children he had, and observed
that one of the things wherein the ancient philosophers, who were without
the true knowledge of god, placed the summum bonum was in the gifts of
nature, in those of fortune, in having many friends, and many and good
children.

"i, senor don quixote," answered the gentleman, "have one son, without
whom, perhaps, i should count myself happier than i am, not because he is
a bad son, but because he is not so good as i could wish. he is e

horace, perseus, juvenal, and tibullus; for of the moderns in our own
language he makes no great account; but with all his seeming indifference
to spanish poetry, just now his thoughts are absorbed in making a gloss
on four lines that have been sent him from salamanca, which i suspect are
for some poetical tournament."

to all this don quixote said in reply, "children, senor, are portions of
their parents' bowels, and therefore, be they good or bad, are to be
loved as we love the souls that give us life; it is for the parents to
guide them from infancy in the ways of virtue, propriety, and worthy
christian conduct, so that when grown up they may be the staff of their
parents' old age, and the glory of their posterity; and to force them to
study this or that science i do not think wise, though it may be no harm
to persuade them

the mind, and as the thought engendered there, so will be the things that
it writes down. and when kings and princes observe this marvellous
science of poetry in wise, virtuous, and thoughtful subjects, they
honour, value, exalt them, and even crown them with the leaves of that
tree which the thunderbolt strikes not, as if to show that they whose
brows are honoured and adorned with such a crown are not to be assailed
by anyone."

he of the green gaban was filled with astonishment at don quixote's
argument, so much so that he began to abandon the notion he had taken up
about his being crazy. but in the middle of the discourse, it being not
very much to his taste, sancho had turned aside out of the road to beg a
little milk from some shepherds, who were milking their ewes hard by; and
just as the gentleman, highly pleased, was about to renew the
conversation, don quixote, raising his head, perceived a cart covered
with royal flags coming along the road they were travelling; and

 
 ___________________________
 
persuaded that this must be some new adventure, he called aloud to sancho
to come and bring him his helmet. sancho, hearing himself called, quitted
the shepherds, and, prodding dapple vigorously, came up to his master, to
whom there fell a terrific and desperate adventure.

the history tells that when don quixote called out to sancho to bring him
his helmet, sancho was buying some curds the shepherds agreed to sell
him, and flurried by the great haste his master was in did not know what
to do with them or what to carry them in; so, not to lose them, for he
had already paid for them, he thought it best to throw them into his
master's helmet, and acting on this bright idea h

 went to see what his
master wanted with him. he, as he approached, exclaimed to him:

"give me that helmet, my friend, for either i know little of adventures,
or what i observe yonder is one that will, and does, call upon me to arm
myself."

he of the green gaban, on hearing this, looked in all directions, but
could perceive nothing, except a cart coming towards them with two or
three small flags, which led him to conclude it must be carrying treasure
of the king's, and he said so to don quixote. he, however, would not
believe him, being always persuaded and convinced that all that happened
to him must be adventures and still more adventures; so he replied to the
gentleman, "he who is prepared has his battle half fought; nothing is
lost by my preparing myself, for i know by experience that i have
enemies, visible and invisible, and i know not when, or where, or at what
moment, or in what shapes they will attack me;" and turning to sancho he
called for his helmet; and sancho, as

he had no time to take out the
curds, had to give it just as it was. don quixote took it, and without
perceiving what was in it thrust it down in hot haste upon his head; but
as the curds were pressed and squeezed the whey began to run all over his
face and beard, whereat he was so startled that he cried out to sancho:

"sancho, what's this? i think my head is softening, or my brains are
melting, or i am sweating from head to foot! if i am sweating it is not
indeed from fear. i am convinced beyond a doubt that the adventure which
is about to befall me is a terrible

persecute me as a creature and limb of your worship, and they must have
put that nastiness there in order to provoke your patience to anger, and
make you baste my ribs as you are wont to do. well, this time, indeed,
they have missed their aim, for i trust to my master's good sense to see
that i have got no curds or milk, or anything of the sort; and that if i
had it is in my stomach i would put it and not in the helmet."

"may be so," said don quixote. all this the gentleman was observing, and
with astonishment, more especially when, after having wiped himself
clean, his head, face, beard, and helmet, don quixote put it on, and
settling himself firmly in his stirrups, easing his sword in the
scabbard, and grasping his lance, he cried, "now, come who will, here am

by this time the cart with the flags had come up, unattended by anyone
except the carter on a mule, and a man sit

planted himself before it and said, "whither are you going, brothers?
what cart is this? what have you got in it? what flags are those?"

to this the carter replied, "the cart is mine; what is in it is a pair of
wild caged lions, which the governor of oran is sending to court as a
present to his majesty; and the flags are our lord the king's, to show
that what is here is his property."

"and are the lions large?" asked don quixote.

"so large," replied the man who sat at the door of the cart, "that
larger, or as large, have never crossed from africa to spain; i am the
keeper, and i have brought over others, but never any like these. they
are male and female; the male is in that first cage and the female in the
one behind, and they are hungry now, for they have eaten nothing to-day,
so let your worship stand aside, for we must make haste to the place
where we are to feed them."

hereupon, smiling slightly, don q

send them here shall see if i am a man to be frightened by lions. get

me out those beasts, and in the midst of this plain i will let them know
who don quixote of la mancha is, in spite and in the teeth of the
enchanters who send them to me."

"so, so," said the gentleman to himself at this; "our worthy knight has
shown of what sort he is; the curds, no doubt, have softened his skull
and brought his brains to a head."

at this instant sancho came up to him, saying, "senor, for god's sake do
something to keep my master, don quixote, from tackling these lions; for
if he does they'll tear us all to pieces here."

asked the gentleman, "that you believe and

who was insisting upon the keeper's opening the cages, he said to him,
"sir knight, knights-errant should attempt adventures which encourage the
hope of a successful issue, not those which entirely withhold it; for
valour that trenches upon temerity savours rather of madness than of
courage; moreover, these lions do not come to oppose you, nor do they
dream of such a thing; they are going as presents to his majesty, and it
will not be right to stop them or delay their journey."

scoundrel, if you don't open the cages this very instant, i'll pin you to

the mules and place myself in safety along with them before the lions are
turned out; for if they kill them on me i am ruined for life, for all i
possess is this cart and mules."

"o man of little faith," replied don quixote, "get down and unyoke; you
will soon see that you are exerting yourself for nothing, and that you
might have spared yourself the trouble."

the carter got down and with all speed unyoked the mules, and the keeper
called out at the top of his voice, "i call all here to witness that
against my will and under compulsion i open the cages and let the lions
loose, and that i warn this gentleman that he will be accountable for all
the harm and mischief which these beasts may do, and for my sal

dues as well. you, gentlemen, place yourselves in safety before i open,
for i know they will do me no harm."

once more the gentleman strove to persuade don quixote not to do such a
mad thing, as it was tempting god to engage in such a piece of folly. to
this, don quixote replied that he knew what he was about. the gentleman
in return entreated him to reflect, for he knew he was under a delusion.

"well, senor," answered don quixote, "if you do not like to be a
spectator of this tragedy, as in your opinion it will be, spur your
flea-bitten mare, and place yourself in safety."

hearing this, sancho with tears in his eyes entreated him to give up an
enterprise compared with which the one of the windmills, and the awful
one of the fulling mills, and, in fact, all the feats he had attempted in
the whole course of his life, were cakes and fancy bread. "look ye,
senor," said sancho, "there's no enchantment here, nor anyt

hing of the
sort, for between the bars and chinks of the cage i have seen the paw of
a real lion, and judging by that i reckon the lion such a paw could
belong to must be bigger than a mountain."

"fear at any rate," replied don quixote, "will make him look bigger to
thee than half the world. retire, sancho, and leave me; and if i die here
thou knowest our old compact; thou wilt repair to dulcinea--i say no
more." to these he added some further words that banished all hope of his
giving up his insane project. he of the green gaban would have offered
resistance, but he found himself ill-matched as to arms, and did not
think it prudent to come to blows with a madman, for such don quixote now
showed himself to be in every

gain; but with all his tears and
lamentations he did not forget to thrash dapple so as to put a good space
between himself and the cart. the keeper, seeing that the fugitives were
now some distance off, once more entreated and warned him as before; but
he replied that he heard him, and that he need not trouble himself with
any further warnings or entreaties, as they would be fruitless, and bade
him make haste.

during the delay that occurred while the keeper was opening the first
cage, don quixote was considering whether it would not be well to do
battle on foot, instead of on horseback, and finally resolved to fight on
foot, fearing that rocinante might take fright at the sight of the lions;
he therefore sprang off his horse, flung his lance aside, braced his
buckler on his arm, and drawing his sword, advanced slowly with
marvellous intrepidity and resolute courage, to plant himself in front of
the cart, commending himself with all his heart to god and to his lady
dulcinea.

 is to be observed, that on coming to this passage, the author of this
veracious history breaks out into exclamations. "o doughty don quixote!
high-mettled past extolling! mirror, wherein all the heroes of the world
may see themselves! second modern don manuel de leon, once the glory and
honour of spanish knighthood! in what words shall i describe this dread
exploit, by what language shall i make it credible to ages to come, what
eulogies are there unmeet for thee, though they be hyperboles piled on
hyperboles! on foot, alone, undaunted, high-souled, with but a simple
sword, and that no trenchant blade of the perrillo brand, a

 shield, but
no bright polished steel one, there stoodst thou, biding and awaiting the
two fiercest lions that africa's forests ever bred! thy own deeds be thy
praise, valiant manchegan, and here i leave them as they stand, wanting
the words wherewith to glorify them!"

here the author's outburst came to an end, and he proceeded to take up
the thread of his story, saying that the keeper, seeing that don quixote
had taken up his position, and that it was impossible for him to avoid
letting out the male without incurring the enmity of the fiery and daring
knight, flung open the doors of the first cage, containing, as has been
said, the lion, which was now seen to be of enormous size, and grim and
hideous mien. the first thing he did was to turn round in the cage in
which he lay, and protrude his claws, and stretch himself thoroughly; he
next opened his mouth, and yawned very leisurely, and with n

palms' length of tongue that he had thrust forth, he licked the dust out
of his eyes and washed his face; having done this, he put his head out of
the cage and looked all round with eyes like glowing coals, a spectacle
and demeanour to strike terror into temerity itself. don quixote merely
observed him steadily, longing for him to leap from the cart and come to
close quarters with him, when he hoped to hew him in pieces.

so far did his unparalleled madness go; but the noble lion, more
courteous than arrogant, not troubling himself about silly bravado, after
having looked all round, as has been said, turned about and presented his
hind-quarters to don quixote, and very coolly and tranquilly lay down
again in the cage. seeing this, don quixote ordered the keeper to

ot seek to tempt fortune a second time. the lion has the door
open; he is free to come out or not to come out; but as he has not come
out so far, he will not come out to-day. your worship's great courage has
been fully manifested already; no brave champion, so it strikes me, is
bound to do more than challenge his enemy and wait for him on the field;
if his adversary does not come, on him lies the disgrace, and he who
waits for him carries off the crown of victory."

"that is true," said don quixote; "close the door, my friend, and let me
have, in the best form thou canst, what thou hast seen me do, by way of
certificate; to wit, that thou didst open for the lion, that i waited for
him, that he did not come out, that i still waited for him, and that
still he did not come out, and lay down again. i am not bound to do more;
enchantments avaunt, and god uphold the right, the truth, and true
chivalry! close the door as i bade thee, while i make signals to the
fugitives that have left us

, that they may learn this exploit from thy
lips."

the keeper obeyed, and don quixote, fixing on the point of his lance the
cloth he had wiped his face with after the deluge of curds, proceeded to
recall the others, who still continued to fly, looking back at every
step, all in a body, the gentleman bringing up the rear. sancho, however,
happening to observe the signal of the white cloth, exclaimed, "may i
die, if my master has not overcome the wild beasts, for he is calling to
us."

they all stopped, and perceived that it was don quixote who was making
signals, and sha

king off their fears to some extent, they approached
slowly until they were near enough to hear distinctly don quixote's voice
calling to them. they returned at length to the cart, and as they came
up, don quixote said to the carter, "put your mules to once more,
brother, and continue your journey; and do thou, sancho, give him two
gold crowns for himself and the keeper, to compensate for the delay they
have incurred through me."

"that will i give with all my heart," said sancho; "but what has become
of the lions? are they dead or alive?"

the keeper, then, in full detail, and bit by bit, described the end of
the contest, exalting to the best of his power and ability the valour of
don quixote,

 at the sight of whom the lion quailed, and would not and
dared not come out of the cage, although he had held the door open ever
so long; and showing how, in consequence of his having represented to the
knight that it was tempting god to provoke the lion in order to force him
out, which he wished to have done, he very reluctantly, and altogether
against his will, had allowed the door to be closed.

"what dost thou think of this, sancho?" said don quixote. "are there any
enchantments that can prevail against true valour? the enchanters may be
able to rob me of good fortune, but of fortitude and courage they
cannot."

sancho paid the crowns, the carter put to, the keeper kissed don
quixote's hands for the bounty bestowed upon him, and promised to give an
account of the valiant exploit to the king himself, as soon as he saw him
at court.

"then," said don quixote, "if his majesty should happen to ask who
performed it, you must say the k

night of the lions; for it is my desire
that into this the name i have hitherto borne of knight of the rueful
countenance be from this time forward changed, altered, transformed, and
turned; and in this i follow the ancient usage of knights-errant, who
changed their names when they pleased, or when it suited their purpose."

the cart went its way, and don quixote, sancho, and he of the green gaban
went theirs. all this time, don diego de miranda had not spoken a word,
being entirely taken up with observing and noting all that don quixote
did and said, and the opinion he formed was that he was a man of brains
gone mad, and a madman on the verge of rationality. the first part of his
history had not yet reached him, for, had he read it, the amazement with
which his words and deeds filled him would have vanished, as he would
then have understood the 
 
 ___________________________
 
nature of his madness; but knowing nothing of
it, he took him to be rational one moment, and crazy the next, for what
he said was sensible, elegant, and well expressed, and what he did,
absurd, rash, and foolish; and said he to himself, "what could be madder
than putting on a helmet full of curds, and then persuading oneself that
enchanters are softening one's skull; or what could be greater rashness
and folly than wanting to fight lions tooth and nail?"

don quixote roused him from these reflections and this soliloquy by
saying, "no doubt, senor don diego de miranda, you set me down in your
mind as a fool and a madman, and it would be no wonder if you did, for my
deeds do not argue anything else. but for all that, i would have you take
notice that i am neither so mad nor so foolish as i must have seemed to
you. a gallant knight shows to advantage bringing his lance to bear
adroitly upon a fierce bull under the eyes of his sovereign, in the midst

hness, than to sink until
he reaches the point of cowardice; for, as it is easier for the prodigal
than for the miser to become generous, so it is easier for a rash man to
prove truly valiant than for a coward to rise to true valour; and believe
me, senor don diego, in attempting adventures it is better to lose by a
card too many than by a card too few; for to hear it said, 'such a knight
is rash and daring,' sounds better than 'such a knight is timid and
cowardly.'"

"i protest, senor don quixote," said don diego, "everything you have said
and done is proved correct by the test of reason itself; and i believe,
if the laws and ordinances of knight-errantry should be lost, they might
be found in your worship's breast as in their own proper depository and
muniment-house; but let us make haste, and reach my village, where you
shall take rest after your late exertions; for if they have not been of

e."

"i take the invitation as a great favour and honour, senor don diego,"
replied don quixote; and pressing forward at a better pace than before,
at about two in the afternoon they reached the village and house of don
diego, or, as don quixote called him, "the knight of the green gaban."

don quixote found don diego de miranda's house built in village style,
with his arms in rough stone over the street door; in the patio was the
store-room, and at the entrance the cellar, with plenty of wine-jars
standing round, which, coming from el toboso, brought back to his memory
his enchanted and transformed dulcinea; and with a sigh, and not thinking
of what he was saying, or in whose presence he was, he exclaimed--

  "o ye sweet treasures, to my sorrow found!
  once sweet and welcome when '

  "o ye tobosan jars, how ye bring back to my memory the
  sweet object of my bitter regrets!"

the student poet, don diego's son, who had come out with his mother to
receive him, heard this exclamation, and both mother and son were filled
with amazement at the extraordinary figure he presented; he, however,
dismounting from rocinante, advanced with great politeness to ask
permission to kiss the lady's hand, while don diego said, "senora, pray
receive with your wonted kindness senor don quixote of la mancha, whom
you see before you, a knight-errant, and the bravest and wisest in the
world."

the lady, whose name was dona christina, received him with every sign of
good-will and great courtesy, and don quixote placed himself at her
service with an abundance of well-chosen and polished phrases. almost the
same civilities were exchanged between him and the student, who listening
to don quixote, took him to be a sensible, clear-headed person.

verything belonging to don diego's
mansion, putting before us in his picture the whole contents of a rich
gentleman-farmer's house; but the translator of the history thought it
best to pass over these and other details of the same sort in silence, as
they are not in harmony with the main purpose of the story, the strong
point of which is truth rather than dull digressions.

they led don quixote into a room, and sancho removed his armour, leaving
him in loose walloon breeches and chamois-leather doublet, all stained
with the rust of his armour; his collar was a falling one of scholastic
cut, without starch or lace, his buskins buff-coloured, and his shoes
polished. he wore his good sword, which hung in a baldric of sea-wolf's
skin, for he had suffered for many years, they say, from an ailment of
the kidneys; and over all he threw a long cloak of good grey cloth. but
first of all

, with five or six buckets of water (for as regard the number
of buckets there is some dispute), he washed his head and face, and still
the water remained whey-coloured, thanks to sancho's greediness and
purchase of those unlucky curds that turned his master so white. thus
arrayed, and with an easy, sprightly, and gallant air, don quixote passed
out into another room, where the student was waiting to entertain him
while the table was being laid; for on the arrival of so distinguished a
guest, dona christina was anxious to show that she knew how and was able
to give a becoming reception to those who came to her house.

while don quixote was taking off his armour, don lorenzo (for so don
diego's son was called) took the opportunity to say to his father, "what
are we to make of this gentleman you have brought home to us, si

 to say, my son," replied. don diego; "all i can tell
thee is that i have seen him act the acts of the greatest madman in the
world, and heard him make observations so sensible that they efface and
undo all he does; do thou talk to him and feel the pulse of his wits, and
as thou art shrewd, form the most reasonable conclusion thou canst as to
his wisdom or folly; though, to tell the truth, i am more inclined to
take him to be mad than sane."

with this don lorenzo went away to entertain don quixote as has been
said, and in the course of the conversation that passed between them don
quixote said to don lorenzo, "your father, senor don diego de miranda,
has told me of the rare abilities and subtle intellect you possess, and,
above all, that you are a great poet."

"a poet, it may be," replied don lorenzo, "but a great one, by no means.
it is true that i am somewhat given to poetry and to reading good poets,
but not so much so as to justify the title of 'great' which my father
gives
 
 ___________________________
 
 me."

"i do not dislike that modesty," said don quixote; "for there is no poet
who is not conceited and does not think he is the best poet in the
world."

"there is no rule without an exception," said don lorenzo; "there may be
some who are poets and yet do not think they are."

"very few," said don quixote; "but tell me, what verses are those which
you have now in hand, and which your father tells me keep you somewhat
restless and absorbed? if it be some gloss, i know something about
glosses, and i should like to hear them; and if they are for a poetical
tournament, contrive to carry off the second prize; for the first always
goes by favour or personal standing, the second by simple justice; and so
the third comes to be the second, and the first, reckoning in this way,
will be third, in th

e same way as licentiate degrees are conferred at the
universities; but, for all that, the title of first is a great
distinction."

"so far," said don lorenzo to himself, "i should not take you to be a
madman; but let us go on." so he said to him, "your worship has
apparently attended the schools; what sciences have you studied?"

"that of knight-errantry," said don quixote, "which is as good as that of
poetry, and even a finger or two above it."

"i do not know what science that is," said don lorenzo, "and until now i
have never heard of it."

"it is a science," said don quixote, "that comprehends in itself all or
most of the sciences in the world, for he who professes it must be a
jurist, and must know the rules of justice, distributive and equitable,
so as to give to each one what belongs to him and is due to him. he must
be a theologian, so as to be

e needy, and, lastly, an upholder
of the truth though its defence should cost him his life. of all these
qualities, great and small, is a true knight-errant made up; judge then,
senor don lorenzo, whether it be a contemptible science which the knight
who studies and professes it has to learn, and whether it may not compare
with the very loftiest that are taught in the schools."

"if that be so," replied don lorenzo, "this science, i protest, surpasses
all."

"how, if that be so?" said don quixote.

"what i mean to say," said don lorenzo, "is, that i doubt whether there
are now, or ever were, any knights-errant, and adorned with such
virtues."

"many a time," replied don quixote, "have i said what i now say once
more, that the majority of the world are of opinion that there never were
any knights-errant in it; and as it is my opinion that, unless heaven by
some miracle brings home to them the truth that there were and are, all
the pains one takes will be in vain (as experience

oned to dinner, they brought their colloquy to a close.
don diego asked his son what he had been able to make out as to the wits
of their guest. to which he replied, "all the doctors and clever scribes
in the world will not make sense of the scrawl of his madness; he is a
madman full of streaks, full of lucid intervals."

they went in to dinner, and the repast was such as don diego said on the
road he was in the habit of giving to his guests, neat, plentiful, and
tasty; but what pleased don quixote most was the marvellous silence that
reigned throughout the house, for it was like a carthusian monastery.

when the cloth had been removed, grace said and their hands washed, don
quixote earnestly pressed don lorenzo to repeat to him his verses for the
poetical tournament, to which he replied, "not to be like those poets
who, when they are asked to recite their verses, refuse, and when they
are not asked for them vomit them up, i will repeat my gloss, for which i
do not expect any priz

ingenuity."

"a discerning friend of mine," said don quixote, "was of opinion that no
one ought to waste labour in glossing verses; and the reason he gave was
that the gloss can never come up to the text, and that often or most
frequently it wanders away from the meaning and purpose aimed at in the
glossed lines; and besides, that the laws of the gloss were too strict,
as they did not allow interrogations, nor 'said he,' nor 'i say,' nor
turning verbs into nouns, or altering the construction, not to speak of
other restrictions and limitations that

 fetter gloss-writers, as you no
doubt know."

"verily, senor don quixote," said don lorenzo, "i wish i could catch your
worship tripping at a stretch, but i cannot, for you slip through my
fingers like an eel."

"i don't understand what you say, or mean by slipping," said don quixote.

"i will explain myself another time," said don lorenzo; "for the present
pray attend to the glossed verses and the gloss, which run thus:

could 'was' become an 'is' for me,
then would i ask no more than this;
or could, for me, the time that is

and dying, seek release from pain.
and yet, thought were the best for me.
  anon the thought aside i fling,

and dread the time that is to be."

when don lorenzo had finished reciting his gloss, don quixote stood up,
and in a loud voice, almost a shout, exclaimed as he grasped don
lorenzo's right hand in his, "by the highest heavens, noble youth, but
you are the best poet on earth, and deserve to be crowned with laurel,
not by cyprus or by gaeta--as a certain poet, god forgive him, said--but
by the academies of athens, if they still flourished, and by those that
flourish now, paris, bologna, salamanca. heaven grant that the judges who

 with his arrows,
and the muses never cross the thresholds of their doors. repeat me some

is there any need to say that don lorenzo enjoyed hearing himself praised
by don quixote, albeit he looked upon him as a madman? power of flattery,
how far-reaching art thou, and how wide are the bounds of thy pleasant
jurisdiction! don lorenzo gave a proof of it, for he complied with don
quixote's request and entreaty, and repeated to him this sonnet on the
fable or story of pyramus and thisbe.

impatient of delay, with reckless pace
  the rash maid wins the fatal spot where she
sinks not in lover's arms but death's embrace.
  so runs the strange tale, how the lovers twain
one sword, one sepulchre, one memory,
  slays, and entombs, and brings to life again.

"blessed be god," said don quixote when he had heard don lorenzo's
sonnet, "that among the hosts there are of irritable poets i have found
one consummate one, which, senor, the art of this sonnet proves to me
that you are!"

for four days was don quixote most sumptuously entertained in don diego's
house, at the end of which time he asked his permission to depart,
telling him he thanked him for the kindness and hospitality he had
received in his house, but that, as it did not become knights-errant to
give themselves up f

 all through the country, and at the same time to investigate and
explore the origin and true source of the seven lakes commonly called the
lakes of ruidera.

don diego and his son commended his laudable resolution, and bade him
furnish himself with all he wanted from their house and belongings, as
they would most gladly be of service to him; which, indeed, his personal
worth and his honourable profession made incumbent upon them.

the day of his departure came at length, as welcome to don quixote as it
was sad and sorrowful to sancho panza, who was very well satisfied with
the abundance of don diego's house, and objected to return to the
starvation of the woods and wilds and the short-commons of his
ill-stocked alforjas; these, however, he filled and packed with what he
considered needful. on taking leave, don quixote said to don lorenzo, "i
know not whether i have told you already, but if i have i tell you once
more, that if you wish to spare yourself fatigue and toil in reachin

inaccessible summit of the temple of fame, you have nothing to do but to
turn aside out of the somewhat narrow path of poetry and take the still
narrower one of knight-errantry, wide enough, however, to make you an
emperor in the twinkling of an eye."

in this speech don quixote wound up the evidence of his madness, but
still better in what he added when he said, "god knows, i would gladly
take don lorenzo with me to teach him how to spare the humble, and
trample the proud under foot, virtues that are part and parcel of the
profession i belong to; but since his tender age does not allow of it,
nor his praiseworthy pursuits permit it, i will simply content myself
with impressing it upon your worship that you will become famous as a

pinion of others rather than by your own;
because no fathers or mothers ever think their own children ill-favoured,
and this sort of deception prevails still more strongly in the case of
the children of the brain."

both father and son were amazed afresh at the strange medley don quixote
talked, at one moment sense, at another nonsense, and at the pertinacity
and persistence he displayed in going through thick and thin in quest of
his unlucky adventures, which he made the end and aim of his desires.
there was a renewal of offers of service and civilities, and then, with
the gracious permission of the lady of the castle, they took their
departure, don quixote on rocinante, and sancho on dapple.

when he fell in with a couple of either priests or students, and a couple

carried, wrapped up in a piece of green buckram by way of a portmanteau,

r way from some large town where they had bought them, and were
taking them home to their village; and both students and peasants were
struck with the same amazement that everybody felt who saw don quixote
for the first time, and were dying to know who this man, so different
from ordinary men, could be. don quixote saluted them, and after
ascertaining that their road was the same as his, made them an offer of
his company, and begged them to slacken their pace, as their young asses
travelled faster than his horse; and then, to gratify them, he told them
in a few words who he was and the calling and profession he followed,
which was that of a knight-errant seeking adventures in all parts of the
world. he informed them that his own name was don quixote of la mancha,

all this was greek or gibberish to the peasants, but not so to the
students, who very soon perceived the crack in don quixote's pate; for
all that, however, they regarded him with admiration and respect, and one
of them said to him, "if you, sir knight, have no fixed road, as it is
the way with those who seek adventures not to have any, let your worship
come with us; you will see one of the finest and richest weddings that up
to this day have ever been celebrated in la mancha, or for many a league
round."

don quixote asked him if it was some prince's, that he spoke of it in
this way. "not at all," said the s

ove of marrying her to basilio, who
had not so large a share of the gifts of fortune as of nature; for if the
truth be told ungrudgingly, he is the most agile youth we know, a mighty
thrower of the bar, a first-rate wrestler, and a great ball-player; he
runs like a deer, and leaps better than a goat, bowls over the nine-pins
as if by magic, sings like a lark, plays the guitar so as to make it
speak, and, above all, handles a sword as well as the best."

"for that excellence alone," said don quixote at this, "the youth
deserves to marry, not merely the fair quiteria, but queen guinevere
herself, were she alive now, in spite of launcelot and all who would try
to prevent it."

"say that to my wife," said sancho, who had until now listened in
silence, "for she won't hear of anything but each one marrying his equal,
holding with the proverb 'each ewe to her like.' what i would like is
that this good basilio (for i am beginning to take a fancy to him
already) should marry this lady qui

meant to say the opposite--on people who would prevent those who love one
another from marrying."

"if all those who love one another were to marry," said don quixote, "it
would deprive parents of the right to choose, and marry their children to
the proper person and at the proper time; and if it was left to daughters
to choose husbands as they pleased, one would be for choosing her
father's servant, and another, some one she has seen passing in the
street and fancies gallant and dashing, though he may be a drunken bully;
for love and fancy easily blind the eyes of the judgment, so much wanted
in choosing one's way of life; and the matrimonial choice

returned, or bartered, or changed; for it is an inseparable accident that
lasts as long as life lasts; it is a noose that, once you put it round
your neck, turns into a gordian knot, which, if the scythe of death does
not cut it, there is no untying. i could say a great deal more on this
subject, were i not prevented by the anxiety i feel to know if the senor
licentiate has anything more to tell about the story of basilio."

to this the student, bachelor, or, as don quixote called him, licentiate,
replied, "i have nothing whatever to say further, but that from the
moment basilio learned that the fair quiteria was to be married to
camacho the rich, he has never been seen to smile, or heard to utter
rational word, and he always goes about moody and dejected, talking to
himself in a way that shows plainly he is out of his senses. he eats
little and sleeps little, and all he eats is fruit, and when he sleeps,
if he sleeps at all, it is in the field on the hard

ell me, is there anyone who can boast of having driven a
nail into the wheel of fortune? no, faith; and between a woman's 'yes'
and 'no' i wouldn't venture to put the point of a pin, for there would
not be room for it; if you tell me quiteria loves basilio heart and soul,
then i'll give him a bag of good luck; for love, i have heard say, looks
through spectacles that make copper seem gold, poverty wealth, and bleary
eyes pearls."

"what art thou driving at, sancho? curses on thee!" said don quixote;
"for when thou takest to stringing proverbs and sayings together, no one
can understand thee but judas himself, and i wish he had thee. tell me,
thou animal, what dost thou know about nails or wheels, or anything
else?"

"oh, if you don't understand me," replied sancho, "it is no wonder my
words are taken for nonsense; but no matter; i understand myself, and i
know i have not said anything very foolish in what i have said; only your
worship, senor, is always gravelling at everything i

"cavilling, not gravelling," said don quixote, "thou prevaricator of

i have not been bred up at court or trained at salamanca, to know whether
i am adding or dropping a letter or so in my words. why! god bless me,
it's not fair to force a sayago-man to speak like a toledan; maybe there
are toledans who do not hit it off when it comes to polished talk."

"that is true," said the licentiate, "for those who have been bred up

"as to whether you turn your back or not, i do not concern myself,"
replied the master of fence; "though it might be that your grave would be
dug on the spot where you planted your foot the first time; i mean that
you would be stretched dead there for despising skill with the sword."

"we shall soon see," replied corchuelo, and getting off his ass briskly,
he drew out furiously one of the swords the licentiate carried on his
beast.

"it must not be that way," said don quixote at this point; "i will be the
director of this fencing match, and judge of this often disputed
question;" and dismounting from rocinante and grasping his lance, he
planted himself in the middle of the road, just as the licentiate, with
an easy, graceful bearing and step, advanced towards corchuelo, who came
on against him, darting fire from his eyes, as the saying is. the other
two of the company, the peasants, without dismounting from their asses,
served as spectators of the mortal trag

bands, some dancing, others singing, others playing the various
instruments already mentioned. in short, it seemed as though mirth and
gaiety were frisking and gambolling all over the meadow. several other
persons were engaged in erecting raised benches from which people might
conveniently see the plays and dances that were to be performed the next
day on the spot dedicated to the celebration of the marriage of camacho
the rich and the obsequies of basilio. don quixote would not enter the
village, although the peasant as well as the bachelor pressed him; he
excused himself, however, on the grounds, amply sufficient in his
opinion, that it was the custom of knights-errant to sleep in the fields
and woods in preference to towns, even were it under gilded ceilings; and
so turned aside a little out of the road, very much against sancho's
will, as the good quarters he had enjoyed in the castle or house of don
diego came back to his mind.

scarce had the fair aurora given bright phoebus time to dry the liquid
pearls upon her golden locks with the heat of his fervent rays, when don
quixote, shaking off sloth from his limbs, sprang to his feet and called
to his squire sancho, who was still snoring; seeing which don quixote ere
he roused him thus addressed him: "happy thou, above all the dwellers on
the face of the earth, that, without envying or being envied, sleepest
with tranquil mind, and that neither enchanters persecute nor
enchantments affright. sleep, i say, and will say a hundred times,
without any jealous thoughts of thy mistress to make thee keep ceaseless
vigils, or any cares as to how thou art to pay the debts thou owest, or
find to-morrow's food for thyself and thy needy little family, to

have imposed upon masters. the servant sleeps and the master lies awake
thinking how he is to feed him, advance him, and reward him. the distress
of seeing the sky turn brazen, and withhold its needful moisture from the
earth, is not felt by the servant but by the master, who in time of
scarcity and famine must support him who has served him in times of
plenty and abundance."

to all this sancho made no reply because he was asleep, nor would he have
wakened up so soon as he did had not don quixote brought him to his
senses with the butt of his lance. he awoke at last, drowsy and lazy, and
casting his eyes about in every direction, observed, "there comes, if i
don't mistake, from the quarter of that arcade a steam and a smell a
great deal more like fried rashers than galingale or thyme; a wedding
that begins with smells like that, by my faith, ought to be plentiful and
unstinting."

"have done, thou glutton," said don quixote; "come, let us go and witness
this bridal, and see wha

sword-play. they won't give a pint of wine at the tavern for a good cast
of the bar or a neat thrust of the sword. talents and accomplishments
that can't be turned into money, let count dirlos have them; but when
such gifts fall to one that has hard cash, i wish my condition of life
was as becoming as they are. on a good foundation you can raise a good
building, and the best foundation in the world is money."

"for god's sake, sancho," said don quixote here, "stop that harangue; it
is my belief, if thou wert allowed to continue all thou beginnest every
instant, thou wouldst have no time left for eating or sleeping; for thou
wouldst spend it all in talking."

"if your worship had a good memory," replied sancho, "you would remember
the articles of our agreement before we started from home this last time;
one of them was that i was to be let say all i liked, so long as it was
not against my neighbour or your worship's authority; and so f

ar, it
seems to me, i have not broken the said article."

"i remember no such article, sancho," said don quixote; "and even if it
were so, i desire you to hold your tongue and come along; for the
instruments we heard last night are already beginning to enliven the
valleys again, and no doubt the marriage will take place in the cool of
the morning, and not in the heat of the afternoon."

sancho did as his master bade him, and putting the saddle on rocinante
and the pack-saddle on dapple, they both mounted and at a leisurely pace
entered the arcade. the first thing that presented itself to sancho's

said the cook; "sinner that i am! how particular and
bashful you are!" and so saying, he seized a bucket and plunging it into
one of the half jars took up three hens and a couple of geese, and said
to sancho, "fall to, friend, and take the edge off your appetite with
these skimmings until dinner-time comes."

"i have nothing to put them in," said sancho.

"well then," said the cook, "take spoon and all; for camacho's wealth and
happiness furnish everything."

while sancho fared thus, don quixote was watching the entrance, at one
end of the arcade, of some twelve peasants, all in holiday and gala
dress, mounted on twelve beautiful mares with rich handsome field
trappings and a number of little bells attached to their petrals, who,
marshalled in regular order, ran not one but several courses over the
meadow, with jubilant shouts and cries of "long live camacho and
quiteria! he as rich as she is fair; and she the fairest on earth!"

hearing this, don quixote said to himself, "it i

r-and-twenty lads of gallant and high-spirited mien,
clad in the finest and whitest of linen, and with handkerchiefs
embroidered in various colours with fine silk; and one of those on the
mares asked an active youth who led them if any of the dancers had been
wounded. "as yet, thank god, no one has been wounded," said he, "we are
all safe and sound;" and he at once began to execute complicated figures
with the rest of his comrades, with so many turns and so great dexterity,
that although don quixote was well used to see dances of the same kind,
he thought he had never seen any so good as this. he also admired another
that came in composed of fair young maidens, none of whom seemed to be
under fourteen or over eighteen years of age, all clad in green stuff,
with their locks partly braided, partly flowing loose, but all of such
bright gold as to vie with the sunbeams, and over them they wore garlands
of jessamine, roses, amaranth, and honeysuckle. at their head were a

in the same manner all the characters of the two bands advanced and
retired, and each executed its figures, and delivered its verses, some of
them graceful, some burlesque, but don quixote's memory (though he had an
excellent one) only carried away those that have been just quoted. all
then mingled together, forming chains and breaking off again with
graceful, unconstrained gaiety; and whenever love passed in front of the
castle he shot his arrows up at it, while interest broke gilded pellets
against it. at length, after they had danced a good while, interest drew
out a great purse, made of the skin of a large brindled cat and to all
appearance full of money, and flung it

take her and lead her away captive, on seeing which, love and his
supporters made as though they would release her, the whole action being
to the accompaniment of the tabors and in the form of a regular dance.
the wild men made peace between them, and with great dexterity readjusted
and fixed the boards of the castle, and the damsel once more ensconced
herself within; and with this the dance wound up, to the great enjoyment
of the beholders.

don quixote asked one of the nymphs who it was that had composed and
arranged it. she replied that it was a beneficiary of the town who had a
nice taste in devising things of the sort. "i will lay a wager," said don
quixote, "that the same bachelor or beneficiary is a greater friend of
camacho's than of basilio's, and that he is better at satire than at
vespers; he has introduced the accomplishments of basilio and the riches
of camacho very neatly into the dance." sancho panza, who was listening
to

all this, exclaimed, "the king is my cock; i stick to camacho." "it is
easy to see thou art a clown, sancho," said don quixote, "and one of that
sort that cry 'long life to the conqueror.'"

"i don't know of what sort i am," returned sancho, "but i know very well
i'll never get such elegant skimmings off basilio's pots as these i have
got off camacho's;" and he showed him the bucketful of geese and hens,
and seizing one began to eat with great gaiety and appetite, saying, "a
fig for the accomplishments of basilio! as much as thou hast so much art
thou worth, and as much as thou art worth so much hast thou. as a

grandmother of mine used to say, there are only two families in the
world, the haves and the haven'ts; and she stuck to the haves; and to
this day, senor don quixote, people would sooner feel the pulse of

horse with a pack-saddle. so once more i say i stick to camacho, the
bountiful skimmings of whose pots are geese and hens, hares and rabbits;

only rinsings."

for three days."

"god grant i may see thee dumb before i die, sancho," said don quixote.

"at the rate we are going," said sancho, "i'll be chewing clay before
your worship dies; and then, maybe, i'll be so dumb that i'll not say a
word until the end of the world, or, at least, till the day of judgment."

"even should that happen, o sancho," said don quixote, "thy silence will
never come up to all thou hast talked, art talking, and wilt talk all thy
life; moreover, it naturally stands to reason, that my death will come
before thine; so i never expect to see thee dumb, not even when thou art
drinking or sleeping, and that is the utmost i can say."

"in good faith, senor," replied sancho, "there's no trusting that

reaping and cutting down, as well the dry grass as the green; she never

has a canine appetite that is never satisfied; and though she has no
belly, she shows she has a dropsy and is athirst to drink the lives of
all that live, as one would drink a jug of cold water."

"say no more, sancho," said don quixote at this; "don't try to better it,
and risk a fall; for in truth what thou hast said about death in thy
rustic phrase is what a good preacher might have said. i tell thee,
sancho, if thou hadst discretion equal to thy mother wit, thou mightst
take a pulpit in hand, and go about the world preaching fine sermons."
"he preaches well who lives well," said sancho, "and i know no more
theology than that."

good a fearer of god as my neighbours; but leave me to despatch these
skimmings, for all the rest is only idle talk that we shall be called to
account for in the other world;" and so saying, he began a fresh attack
on the bucket, with such a hearty appetite that he aroused don quixote's,
who no doubt would have helped him had he not been prevented by what must
be told farther on.

while don quixote and sancho were engaged in the discussion set forth the
last chapter, they heard loud shouts and a great noise, which were
uttered and made by the men on the mares as they went at full gallop,
shouting, to receive the bride and bridegroom, who were approaching with

don quixote laughed at sancho's boorish eulogies and thought that, saving
his lady dulcinea del toboso, he had never seen a more beautiful woman.
the fair quiteria appeared somewhat pale, which was, no doubt, because of
the bad night brides always pass dressing themselves out for their
wedding on the morrow. they advanced towards a theatre that stood on one
side of the meadow decked with carpets and boughs, where they were to
plight their troth, and from which they were to behold the dances and

leaving one half of it fixed there, showed it to be a sheath that
concealed a tolerably long rapier; and, what may be called its hilt being
planted in the ground, he swiftly, coolly, and deliberately threw himself
upon it, and in an instant the bloody point and half the steel blade
appeared at his back, the unhappy man falling to the earth bathed in his
blood, and transfixed by his own weapon.

his friends at once ran to his aid, filled with grief at his misery and
sad fate, and don quixote, dismounting from rocinante, hastened to
support him, and took him in his arms, and found he had not yet ceased to
breathe. they were about to draw out the rapier, but the priest who was
standing by objected to its being withdrawn before he had confessed him,
as the instant of its withdrawal would be that of this death. basilio,
however, reviving slightly, said in a weak voice, as though in pain, "if
thou wouldst consent, cruel quiteria, to give me thy hand as my bride in
this last fatal

hope that my rashness would find
pardon, as by its means i attained the bliss of being thine."

hearing this the priest bade him think of the welfare of his soul rather
than of the cravings of the body, and in all earnestness implore god's
pardon for his sins and for his rash resolve; to which basilio replied
that he was determined not to confess unless quiteria first gave him her
hand in marriage, for that happiness would compose his mind and give him
courage to make his confession.

don quixote hearing the wounded man's entreaty, exclaimed aloud that what
basilio asked was just and reasonable, and moreover a request that might
be easily complied with; and that it would be as much to senor camacho's
honour to receive the lady quiteria as the widow of the brave basilio as
if he received her direct from her father.

consequences can follow the utterance of the word, for the nuptial couch

on; on the
contrary, hearing them say that the marriage, being fraudulent, would not
be valid, she said that she confirmed it afresh, whence they all
concluded that the affair had been planned by agreement and understanding
between the pair, whereat camacho and his supporters were so mortified
that they proceeded to revenge themselves by violence, and a great number
of them drawing their swords attacked basilio, in whose protection as
many more swords were in an instant unsheathed, while don quixote taking
the lead on horseback, with his lance over his arm and well covered with
his shield, made all give way before him. sancho, who never found any
pleasure or enjoyment in such doings, retreated to the wine-jars from
which he had taken his delectable skimmings, considering that, as a holy
place, that spot would be respected.

"hold, sirs, hold!" cried don quixote in a loud voice; "we have no right
to take vengeance for wrongs that love may do to us: remember love and

the rich camacho, to
show that he felt no resentment for the trick, and did not care about it,
desired the festival to go on just as if he were married in reality.
neither basilio, however, nor his bride, nor their followers would take
any part in it, and they withdrew to basilio's village; for the poor, if
they are persons of virtue and good sense, have those who follow, honour,
and uphold them, just as the rich have those who flatter and dance
attendance on them. with them they carried don quixote, regarding him as
a man of worth and a stout one. sancho alone had a cloud on his soul, for
he found himself debarred from waiting for camacho's splendid feast and
festival, which lasted until night; and thus dragged away, he moodily
followed his master, who accompanied basilio's party, and left behind him
the flesh-pots of egypt; though in his heart he took them with him, and
their now nearly finished skimmings that he carried in the bucket

married couple, who felt themselves under an obligation to him for coming
forward in defence of their cause; and they exalted his wisdom to the
same level with his courage, rating him as a cid in arms, and a cicero in
eloquence. worthy sancho enjoyed himself for three days at the expense of
the pair, from whom they learned that the sham wound was not a scheme
arranged with the fair quiteria, but a device of basilio's, who counted
on exactly the result they had seen; he confe

"that," said don quixote, "is not and ought not to be called deception
which aims at virtuous ends;" and the marriage of lovers he maintained to
be a most excellent end, reminding them, however, that love has no
greater enemy than hunger and constant want; for love is all gaiety,
enjoyment, and happiness, especially when the lover is in the possession
of the object of his love, and poverty and want are the declared enemies
of all these; which he said to urge senor basilio to abandon the practice

by itself attracts the desires of all who behold it, and the royal eagles
and birds of towering flight stoop on it as on a dainty lure; but if
beauty be accompanied by want and penury, then the ravens and the kites
and other birds of prey assail it, and she who stands firm against such
attacks well deserves to be called the crown of her husband. "remember, o
prudent basilio," added don quixote, "it was the opinion of a certain
sage, i know not whom, that there was not more than one good woman in the
whole world; and his advice was that each one should think and believe
that this one good woman was his own wife, and in this way he would live

r overheard him, and
asked, "what art thou muttering there, sancho?"

"i'm not saying anything or muttering anything," said sancho; "i was only
saying to myself that i wish i had heard what your worship has said just
now before i married; perhaps i'd say now, 'the ox that's loose licks
himself well.'"

"is thy teresa so bad then, sancho?"

"she is not very bad," replied sancho; "but she is not very good; at
least she is not as good as i could wish."

"thou dost wrong, sancho," said don quixote, "to speak ill of thy wife;
for after all she is the mother of thy children." "we are quits,"
returned sancho; "for she speaks ill of me whenever she takes it into her
head, especially when she is jealous; and satan himself could not put up
with her then."

in fine, they remained three days with the newly married couple, by whom
they were entertained and treated like kings. don quixote begged the
fencing licentiate to find him a guide to show him the way to the cave of

back to where i have my books, and will satisfy you the next time we
meet, for this will not be the last time."

"look here, senor," said sancho, "don't give yourself any trouble about
it, for i have just this minute hit upon what i asked you. the first
tumbler in the world, you must know, was lucifer, when they cast or
pitched him out of heaven; for he came tumbling into the bottomless pit."

"you are right, friend," said the cousin; and said don quixote, "sancho,
that question and answer are not thine own; thou hast heard them from
some one else."

"hold your peace, senor," said sancho; "faith, if i take to asking
questions and answering, i'll go on from this till to-morrow morning.
nay! to ask foolish things and answer nonsense i needn't go looking for
help from my neighbours."

"thou hast said more than thou art aware of, sancho," said don quixote;
"for there are some who weary themselves out in learning and proving
things that, a

the understanding or memory."

in this and other pleasant conversation the day went by, and that night
they put up at a small hamlet whence it was not more than two leagues to
the cave of montesinos, so the cousin told don quixote, adding, that if
he was bent upon entering it, it would be requisite for him to provide
himself with ropes, so that he might be tied and lowered into its depths.
don quixote said that even if it reached to the bottomless pit he meant
to see where it went to; so they bought about a hundred fathoms of rope,
and next day at two in the afternoon they arrived at the cave, the mouth
of which is spacious and wide, but full of thorn and wild-fig bushes and
brambles and briars, so thick and matted that they completely close it up
and cover it over.

on coming within sight of it the cousin, sancho, and don quixote
dismounted, and the first two immediately tied the la

tter very firmly
with the ropes, and as they were girding and swathing him sancho said to
him, "mind what you are about, master mine; don't go burying yourself
alive, or putting yourself where you'll be like a bottle put to cool in a
well; it's no affair or business of your worship's to become the explorer
of this, which must be worse than a moorish dungeon."

"tie me and hold thy peace," said don quixote, "for an emprise like this,
friend sancho, was reserved for me;" and said the guide, "i beg of you,
senor don quixote, to observe carefully and examine with a hundred eyes
everything that is within there; perhaps there may be some things for me
to put into my book of 'transformations.'"

"the drum is in hands that will know how to beat it well enough," said
sancho panza.

when he had said this and finished the tying (which was not over the
armour but only over the doublet) don quixote

ly to let the world know that while
thou dost favour me there is no impossibility i will not attempt and
accomplish." with these words he approached the cavern, and perceived
that it was impossible to let himself down or effect an entrance except
by sheer force or cleaving a passage; so drawing his sword he began to
demolish and cut away the brambles at the mouth of the cave, at the noise
of which a vast multitude of crows and choughs flew out of it so thick
and so fast that they knocked don quixote down; and if he had been as
much of a believer in augury as he was a catholic christian he would have
taken it as a bad omen and declined to bury himself in such a place. he
got up, however, and as there came no more crows, or night-birds like the
bats that flew out at the same time with the crows, the cousin and sancho
giving him rope, he lowered himself into the depths of the dread cavern;
and as he entered it sancho sent his blessing after him, making a
thousand crosses over him and s

unhurt to the light of this world thou art leaving to bury thyself in the
darkness thou art seeking there;" and the cousin offered up almost the
same prayers and supplications.

don quixote kept calling to them to give him rope and more rope, and they
gave it out little by little, and by the time the calls, which came out
of the cave as out of a pipe, ceased to be heard they had let down the
hundred fathoms of rope. they were inclined to pull don quixote up again,
as they could give him no more rope; however, they waited about half an
hour, at the end of which time they began to gather in the rope again
with great ease and without feeling any weight, which made them fancy do

quixote was remaining below; and persuaded that it was so, sancho wept
bitterly, and hauled away in great haste in order to settle the question.
when, however, they had come to, as it seemed, rather more than eighty
fathoms they felt a weight, at which they were greatly delighted; and at
last, at ten fathoms more, they saw don quixote distinctly, and sancho
called out to him, saying, "welcome back, senor, for we had begun to
think you were going to stop there to found a family." but don quixote
answered not a word, and drawing him out entirely they perceived he had
his eyes shut and every appearance of being fast asleep.

they stretched him on the ground and untied him, but still he did not
awake; however, they rolled him back and forwards and shook and pulled
him about, so that after some time he came to himself, stretching himself
just as if he were waking up from a deep and sound sleep, and looking
about him he said, "god forgive you, friends; ye have taken me away from

belerma! o tearful guadiana, and ye o hapless daughters of ruidera who
show in your waves the tears that flowed from your beauteous eyes!"

the cousin and sancho panza listened with deep attention to the words of
don quixote, who uttered them as though with immense pain he drew them up
from his very bowels. they begged of him to explain himself, and tell
them what he had seen in that hell down there.

"hell do you call it?" said don quixote; "call it by no such name, for it
does not deserve it, as ye shall soon see."

he then begged them to give him something to eat, as he was very hungry.
they spread the cousin's sackcloth on the grass, and put the stores of

it was about four in the afternoon when the sun, veiled in clouds, with
subdued light and tempered beams, enabled don quixote to relate, without
heat or inconvenience, what he had seen in the cave of montesinos to his
two illustrious hearers, and he began as follows:

"a matter of some twelve or fourteen times a man's height down in this

his bearing, his gait, his dignity and imposing presence held me
spellbound and wondering. he approached me, and the first thing he did
was to embrace me closely, and then he said to me, 'for a long time now,

bove here was true, that he had taken out the heart of
his great friend durandarte from his breast with a little dagger, and
carried it to the lady belerma, as his friend when at the point of death
had commanded him. he said in reply that they spoke the truth in every
respect except as to the dagger, for it was not a dagger, nor little, but
a burnished poniard sharper than an awl."

"that poniard must have been made by ramon de hoces the sevillian," said
sancho.

"i do not know," said don quixote; "it could not have been by that
poniard maker, however, because ramon de hoces was a man of yesterday,
and the affair of roncesvalles, where this mishap occurred, was long ago;
but the question is of no great importance, nor does it affect or make
any alteration in the truth or substance of the story."

"that is true," said the cousin; "continue, senor don quixote, for i am
listening to you with the greatest pleasure in the world."

"and with no less do i tell the tale," said don quix

 of the golden tagus. all
this that i tell you now, o cousin mine, i have told you many times
before, and as you make no answer, i fear that either you believe me not,
or do not hear me, whereat i feel god knows what grief. i have now news
to give you, which, if it serves not to alleviate your sufferings, will
not in any wise increase them. know that you have here before you (open
your eyes and you will see) that great knight of whom the sage merlin has
prophesied such great things; that don quixote of la mancha i mean, who
has again, and to better purpose than in past times, revived in these
days knight-errantry, long since forgotten, and by whose intervention and
aid it may be we shall be disenchanted; for great deeds are reserved for
great men.'

"'and if that may not be,' said the wretched durandarte in a low and
feeble voice, 'if that may not be, then, my cousin, i say "patience and
shuffle;"' and turning over on his side, he relapsed into his former
silence without uttering

world, come up to her for beauty, grace, and gaiety.'

"'hold hard!' said i at this, 'tell your story as you ought, senor don
montesinos, for you know very well that all comparisons are odious, and
there is no occasion to compare one person with another; the peerless
dulcinea del toboso is what she is, and the lady dona belerma is what she
is and has been, and that's enough.' to which he made answer, 'forgive
me, senor don quixote; i own i was wrong and spoke unadvisedly in saying
that the lady dulcinea could scarcely come up to the lady belerma; for it
were enough for me to have learned, by what means i know not, that you
are her knight, to make me bite my tongue out before i compared her to
anything save heaven itself.' after this apology which the great
montesinos made me, my heart recovered itself from the shock i had
received in hearing my lady compared with belerma."

"still i wonder," said sancho, "that yo

until you didn't leave a hair in it."

"nay, sancho, my friend," said don quixote, "it would not have been right
in me to do that, for we are all bound to pay respect to the aged, even
though they be not knights, but especially to those who are, and who are
enchanted; i only know i gave him as good as he brought in the many other
questions and answers we exchanged."

"i cannot understand, senor don quixote," remarked the cousin here, "how
it is that your worship, in such a short space of time as you have been
below there, could have seen so many things, and said and

answered so
much."

"how long is it since i went down?" asked don quixote.

"little better than an hour," replied sancho.

"that cannot be," returned don quixote, "because night overtook me while
i was there, and day came, and it was night again and day again three
times; so that, by my reckoning, i have been three days in those remote
regions beyond our ken."

"my master must be right," replied sancho; "for as everything that has
happened to him is by enchantment, maybe what seems to us an hour would
seem three days and nights there."

"that's it," said don quixote.

"and did your worship eat anything all that time, senor?" asked the
cousin

.

"i never touched a morsel," answered don quixote, "nor did i feel hunger,
or think of it."

"and do the enchanted eat?" said the cousin.

"they neither eat," said don quixote; "nor are they subject to the
greater excrements, though it is thought that their nails, beards, and
hair grow."

"and do the enchanted sleep, now, senor?" asked sancho.

"certainly not," replied don quixote; "at least, during those three days
i was with them not one of them closed an eye, nor did i either."

"the proverb, 'tell me what company thou keepest and i'll tell thee what
thou art,' is to the point here," said sancho; "your worship keeps
company with enchanted people that are always fasting and watching; what
wonder is it, then, that you neither eat nor sleep while you are with
them? but forgive me, senor, if i say that of all this you have told us
now, may god take me--i was just

going to say the devil--if i believe a

"what!" said the cousin, "has senor don quixote, then, been lying? why,
even if he wished it he has not had time to imagine and put together such
a host of lies."

"i don't believe my master lies," said sancho.

"if not, what dost thou believe?" asked don quixote.

"i believe," replied sancho, "that this merlin, or those enchanters who
enchanted the whole crew your worship says you saw and discoursed with
down there, stuffed your imagination or your mind with all this rigmarole
you have been treating us to, and all that is still to come."

"all that might be, sancho," replied don quixote; "but it is not so, for
everything that i have told you i saw with my own eyes, and touched with
my own hands. but what will you say when i tell you now how, a

ark mad, so
he said to him, "it was an evil hour, a worse season, and a sorrowful
day, when your worship, dear master mine, went down to the other world,
and an unlucky moment when you met with senor montesinos, who has sent
you back to us like this. you were well enough here above in your full
senses, such as god had given you, delivering maxims and giving advice at
every turn, and not as you are now, talking the greatest nonsense that
can be imagined."

"as i know thee, sancho," said don quixote, "i heed not thy words."

"nor i your worship's," said sancho, "whether you beat me or kill me for
those i have spoken, and will speak if you don't correct and mend your
own. but tell me, while we are still at peace, how or by what did you
recognise the lady our mistress; and if you spoke to her, what did you
say, and what did she answer?"

"i recognised her," said don quixote, "by her wearing the same garments
she wore when thou didst point her out to me. i spoke to her, but she did

and, being in great need, she also entreats your
worship as earnestly as she can to be so good as to lend her half a dozen
reals, or as much as you may have about you, on this new dimity petticoat
that i have here; and she promises to repay them very speedily.' i was
amazed and taken aback by such a message, and turning to senor montesinos
i asked him, 'is it possible, senor montesinos, that persons of
distinction under enchantment can be in need?' to which he replied,
'believe me, senor don quixote, that which is called need is to be met
with everywhere, and penetrates all quarters and reaches everyone, and
does not spare even the enchanted; and as the lady dulcinea del toboso
sends to beg those six reals, and the pledge is to all appearance a good
one, there is nothing for it but to give them to her, for no doubt she
must be in some great strait.' 'i will take no pledge of her,' i replied,
'nor yet can i give her what she asks, for all i have is four reals;

of montesinos he found written on the
margin of it, in hamete's own hand, these exact words:

"i cannot convince or persuade myself that everything that is written in
the preceding chapter could have precisely happened to the valiant don
quixote; and for this reason, that all the adventures that have occurred
up to the present have been possible and probable; but as for this one of
the cave, i see no way of accepting it as true, as it passes all
reasonable bounds. for me to believe that don quixote could lie, he being
the most truthful gentleman and the noblest knight of his time, is
impossible; he would not have told a lie though he were shot to death
with arrows. on the other hand, i reflect that he related and told the
story with all the circumstances detailed, and that he could not in so
short a space have fabricated such a vast complication of absurdities;
if, then, this adventure seems apocryphal, it is no fault of mine; and
so, without affirming its falsehood or its truth, i

d read of in his histories." and then he
goes on to say:

the cousin was amazed as well at sancho's boldness as at the patience of
his master, and concluded that the good temper the latter displayed arose
from the happiness he felt at having seen his lady dulcinea, even
enchanted as she was; because otherwise the words and language sancho had
addressed to him deserved a thrashing; for indeed he seemed to him to
have been rather impudent to his master, to whom he now observed, "i,
senor don quixote of la mancha, look upon the time i have spent in
travelling with your worship as very well employed, for i have gained
four things in the course of it; the first is that i have made your
acquaintance, which i consider great good fortune; the second, that i
have learned what the cave of montesinos contains, together with the
transformations of guadiana and of the lakes of ruidera; which will be of
use to me for the spanish ovid that i have in hand; the third, to have
discovered the antiqu

 just the thing for me for
that other book i am writing, the 'supplement to polydore vergil on the
invention of antiquities;' for i believe he never thought of inserting
that of cards in his book, as i mean to do in mine, and it will be a
matter of great importance, particularly when i can cite so grave and
veracious an authority as senor durandarte. and the fourth thing is, that
i have ascertained the source of the river guadiana, heretofore unknown
to mankind."

"you are right," said don quixote; "but i should like to know, if by
god's favour they grant you a licence to print those books of yours-which
i doubt--to whom do you mean to dedicate them?"

"there are lords and grandees in spain to whom they can be dedicated,"
said the cousin.

"not many," said don quixote; "not that they are unworthy of it, but
because they do not care to accept books and incur the obligation of
making the return that seems due to the author's labour and courtesy. one
prince i know who makes up for

ace to shelter ourselves in to-night."

"not far from this," said the cousin, "there is a hermitage, where there
lives a hermit, who they say was a soldier, and who has the reputation of
being a good christian and a very intelligent and charitable man. close
to the hermitage he has a small house which he built at his own cost, but
though small it is large enough for the reception of guests."

"has this hermit any hens, do you think?" asked sancho.

"few hermits are without them," said don quixote; "for those we see
now-a-days are not like the hermits of the egyptian deserts who were clad
in palm-leaves, and lived on the roots of the earth. but do not think
that by praising these i am disparaging the others; all i mean to say is
that the penances of those of the present day do not come up to the
asceticism and austerity of former times; but it does not follow from
this that they are not all worthy; at least i think them so; and at the
worst the hypocrite who pretends to be good do

at this point they saw approaching the spot where they stood a man on
foot, proceeding at a rapid pace, and beating a mule loaded with lances
and halberds. when he came up to them, he saluted them and passed on
without stopping. don quixote called to him, "stay, good fellow; you seem
to be making more haste than suits that mule."

"i cannot stop, senor," answered the man; "for the arms you see i carry
here are to be used tomorrow, so i must not delay; god be with you. but
if you want to know what i am carrying them for, i mean to lodge to-night
at the inn that is beyond the hermitage, and if you be going the same
road you will find me there, and i will tell you some curious things;
once more god be with you;" and he urged

on his mule at such a pace that
don quixote had no time to ask him what these curious things were that he
meant to tell them; and as he was somewhat inquisitive, and always
tortured by his anxiety to learn something new, he decided to set out at
once, and go and pass the night at the inn instead of stopping at the
hermitage, where the cousin would have had them halt. accordingly they
mounted and all three took the direct road for the inn, which they
reached a little before nightfall. on the road the cousin proposed they
should go

up to the hermitage to drink a sup. the instant sancho heard
this he steered his dapple towards it, and don quixote and the cousin did
the same; but it seems sancho's bad luck so ordered it that the hermit
was not at home, for so a sub-hermit they found in the hermitage told
them. they called for some of the best. she replied that her master had
none, but that if they liked cheap water she would give it with great
pleasure.

"if i found any in water," said sancho, "there are wells along the road
where i could have had enough of it. ah, camacho's wedding, and plentiful

 of silk, and his shoes
square-toed as they wear them at court. his age might have been eighteen
or nineteen; he was of a merry countenance, and to all appearance of an
active habit, and he went along singing seguidillas to beguile the
wearisomeness of the road. as they came up with him he was just finishing
one, which the cousin got by heart and they say ran thus--

  for the want of pence,
oh, had i but money
  i'd show more sense.

the first to address him was don quixote, who said, "you travel very
airily, sir gallant; whither bound, may we ask, if it is your pleasure to
tell us?"

to which the youth replied, "the heat and my poverty are the reason of my
travelling so airily, and it is to the wars that i am bound."

"how poverty?" asked don quixote; "the heat one can understand."

"senor," replied the youth, "in this bundle i carry velvet pantaloons to
match this jacket; if i wear them out on the road, i shall not be able to

 should have been safe to get it; for
that is the advantage of serving good masters, that out of the servants'
hall men come to be ancients or captains, or get a good pension. but i,
to my misfortune, always served place-hunters and adventurers, whose keep
and wages were so miserable and scanty that half went in paying for the
starching of one's collars; it would be a miracle indeed if a page
volunteer ever got anything like a reasonable bounty."

"and tell me, for heaven's sake," asked don quixote, "is it possible, my
friend, that all the time you served you never got any livery?"

"they gave me two," replied the page; "but just as when one quits a
religious community before making profession, they strip him of the dress
of the order and give him back his own clothes, so did my masters return
me mine; for as soon as the business on which they came to court was
finished, they went home and took back the liveries they had given merely
for show."

"what spilorceria!--as an italian

 would say," said don quixote; "but for
all that, consider yourself happy in having left court with as worthy an
object as you have, for there is nothing on earth more honourable or
profitable than serving, first of all god, and then one's king and
natural lord, particularly in the profession of arms, by which, if not
more wealth, at least more honour is to be won than by letters, as i have

 inn; and here they say sancho said to himself, "god be with
you for a master; is it possible that a man who can say things so many
and so good as he has said just now, can say that he saw the impossible
absurdities he reports about the cave of montesinos? well, well, we shall
see."

and now, just as night was falling, they reached the inn, and it was not
without satisfaction that sancho perceived his master took it for a real
inn, and not for a castle as usual. the instant they entered don quixote
asked the landlord after the man with the lances and halberds, and was
told that he was in the stable seeing to his mule; which was what sancho
and the cousin proceeded to do for their beasts, giving the best manger
and the best place in the stable to rocinante.

 is, until he had
heard and learned the curious things promised by the man who carried the
arms. he went to seek him where the innkeeper said he was and having
found him, bade him say now at any rate what he had to say in answer to
the question he had asked him on the road. "the tale of my wonders must
be taken more leisurely and not standing," said the man; "let me finish
foddering my beast, good sir; and then i'll tell you things that will
astonish you."

"don't wait for that," said don quixote; "i'll help you in everything,"
and so he did, sifting the barley for him and cleaning out the manger; a
degree of humility which made the other feel bound to tell him with a
good grace what he had asked; so seating himself on a bench, with don
quixote beside him, and the cousin, the page, sancho panza, and the
landlord, for a senate and an audience, he began his story in this way:

"you must know that in a village four leagues and a half from this inn,
it so happened that one of the re

 to know if there was any room."
"i'd make the duke of alva himself clear out to make room for master
pedro," said the landlord; "bring in the ape and the show; there's
company in the inn to-night that will pay to see that and the cleverness
of the ape." "so be it by all means," said the man with the patch; "i'll
lower the price, and be well satisfied if i only pay my expenses; and now
i'll go back and hurry on the cart with the ape and the show;" and with
this he went out of the inn.

don quixote at once asked the landlord what this master pedro was, and
what was the show and what was the ape he had with him; which the
landlord replied, "this is a famous puppet-showman, who for some time
past has been going about this mancha de aragon, exhibiting a show of the
release of melisendra by the famous don gaiferos, one of the best and
best-represented stories that have been seen in this part of the kingdom
for many a year; he has also with him an ape with the most extraordinary

er answers for him after he has
whispered into his ear; and so it is believed that this same master pedro
is very rich. he is a 'gallant man' as they say in italy, and good
company, and leads the finest life in the world; talks more than six,
drinks more than a dozen, and all by his tongue, and his ape, and his
show."

master pedro now came back, and in a cart followed the show and the
ape--a big one, without a tail and with buttocks as bare as felt, but not
vicious-looking. as soon as don quixote saw him, he asked him, "can you
tell me, sir fortune-teller, what fish do we catch, and how will it be
with us? see, here are my two reals," and he bade sancho give them to
master pedro; but he answered for the ape and said, "senor, this animal
does not give any answer or information touching things that are to come;
of things past he knows something, and more or less of things present."

"gad," said sancho, "i would not give a farthing to be told what's past
with me, for who knows that

will not receive
payment in advance or until the service has been first rendered;" and
then with his right hand he gave a couple of slaps on his left shoulder,
and with one spring the ape perched himself upon it, and putting his
mouth to his master's ear began chattering his teeth rapidly; and having
kept this up as long as one would be saying a credo, with another spring
he brought himself to the ground, and the same instant master pedro ran
in great haste and fell upon his knees before don quixote, and embracing
his legs exclaimed, "these legs do i embrace as i would embrace the two
pillars of hercules, o illustrious reviver of knight-errantry, so long
consigned to oblivion! o never yet duly extolled knight, don quixote of
la mancha, courage of the faint-hearted, prop of the tottering, arm of
the fallen, staff and counsel of all who are unfortunate!"

don quixote was thunderstruck, sancho astounded, the cousin staggered,
the page astonished, the man from the braying town agape, t

broken spout that holds a good drop of wine, with which she solaces
herself at her work."

"that i can well believe," said sancho. "she is a lucky one, and if it
was not for her jealousy i would not change her for the giantess
andandona, who by my master's account was a very clever and worthy woman;
my teresa is one of those that won't let themselves want for anything,
though their heirs may have to pay for it."

"now i declare," said don quixote, "he who reads much and travels much
sees and knows a great deal. i say so because what amount of persuasion
could have persuaded me that there are apes in the world that can divine
as i have seen now with my own eyes? for i am that very don quixote of la
mancha this worthy animal refers to, though he has gone rather too far in
my praise; but whatever i may be, i thank heaven that it has endowed me
with a tender and compassionate heart, always disposed to do good to all
and harm to none.

"if i had money," said the page, "i would ask senor ape what will happen
to me in the peregrination i am making."

to this master pedro, who had by this time risen from don quixote's feet,
replied, "i have already said that this little beast gives no answer as
to the future; but if he did, not having money would be of no
consequence, for to oblige senor don quixote, here present, i would give
up all the profits in the world. and now, because i have promised it, and
to afford him pleasure, i will set up my show and offer entertainment to
all who are in the inn, without any charge whatever." as soon as he heard
this, the landlord, delighted beyond measure, pointed out a place where
the show might be fixed, which was done at once.

don quixote was not very well satisfied with the divinations of the ape,
as he did not think it proper that an ape shoul

 the stable, where, without being overheard
by anyone, he said to him, "look here, sancho, i have been seriously
thinking over this ape's extraordinary gift, and have come to the
conclusion that beyond doubt this master pedro, his master, has a pact,
tacit or express, with the devil."

"if the packet is express from the devil," said sancho, "it must be a
very dirty packet no doubt; but what good can it do master pedro to have
such packets?"

"thou dost not understand me, sancho," said don quixote; "i only mean he
must have made some compact with the devil to infuse this power into the
ape, that he may get his living, and after he has grown rich he will give
him his soul, which is what the enemy of mankind wants; this i am led to
believe by observing that the ape only answers about things past or
present, and the devil's knowledge extends no further; for the future he
knows only by guesswork, and that not always; for it is reserved for god
alone to know the times and the seasons,

being a most profound astrologer, as most of these planet-rulers have."

"still," said sancho, "i would be glad if your worship would make master
pedro ask his ape whether what happened your worship in the cave of
montesinos is true; for, begging your worship's pardon, i, for my part,
take it to have been all flam and lies, or at any rate something you
dreamt."

"that may be," replied don quixote; "however, i will do what you suggest;
though i have my own scruples about it."

at this point master pedro came up in quest of don quixote, to tell him
the show was now ready and to come and see it, for it was worth seeing.
don quixote explained his wish, and begged him to ask his ape at once to
tell him whether certain things which had happened to him in the cave of
montesinos were dreams or realities, for to him they appeared to partake
of both. upon this master pedro, without answer

the ape, and, having placed it in front of don quixote and sancho, said:
"see here, senor ape, this gentleman wishes to know whether certain
things which happened to him in the cave called the cave of montesinos
were false or true." on his making the usual sign the ape mounted on his
left shoulder and seemed to whisper in his ear, and master pedro said at
once, "the ape says that the things you saw or that happened to you in
that cave are, part of them false, part true; and that he only knows this
and no more as regards this question; but if

"did i not say, senor," said sancho, "that i could not bring myself to
believe that all your worship said about the adventures in the cave was
true, or even the half of it?"

"the course of events will tell, sancho," replied don quixote; "time,
that discloses all things, leaves nothing that it does not drag into the
light of day, though it be buried in the bosom of the earth. but enough
of that for the present; let us go and see master pedro's show, for i am
sure there must be something novel in it."

"something!" said master pedro; "this show of mine has sixty thousand
novel things in it; let me tell you, senor don quixote, it is one of the
best-worth-seeing things in the world this day; but operibus credite et

don quixote and sancho obeyed him and went to where the show was already
put up and uncovered, set all around with lighted wax tapers which made
it look splendid and bright. when they came to it master pedro ensconced
himself inside it, for it was he who had to work the puppets, and a boy,
a servant of his, posted himself outside to act as showman and explain
the mysteries of the exhibition, having a wand in his hand to point to
the figures as they came out. and so, all who were in the inn being

 is king marsilio of sansuena, who, having seen the moor's
insolence, at once orders him (though his kinsman and a great favourite
of his) to be seized and given two hundred lashes, while carried through
the streets of the city according to custom, with criers going before him
and officers of justice behind; and here you see them come out to execute
the sentence, although the offence has been scarcely committed; for among
the moors there are no indictments nor remands as with us."

here don quixote called out, "child, child, go straight on with your
story, and don't run into curves and slants, for to establish a fact
clearly there is need of a great deal of proof and confirmation;" and
said master pedro from within, "boy, stick to your text and do as the
gentleman bids you; it's the best plan; keep to your plain song, and
don't attempt harmonies, for they are apt to break down from being over
fine."

"i will," said the boy, and he went on to say, "this figure that you see

here master pedro called out again and said, "simplicity, boy! none of
your high flights; all affectation is bad."

the interpreter made no answer, but went on to say, "there was no want of
idle eyes, that see everything, to see melisendra come down and mount,
and word was brought to king marsilio, who at once gave orders to sound
the alarm; and see what a stir there is, and how the city is drowned with
the sound of the bells pealing in the towers of all the mosques."

"nay, nay," said don quixote at this; "on that point of the bells master
pedro is very inaccurate, for bells are not in use among the moors; only
kettledrums, and a kind of small trumpet somewhat like our clarion; to
ring bells this way in sansuena is unquestionably a great absurdity."

on hearing this, master pedro stopped ringing, and said, "don't look into
trifles, senor don quixote, or want to have things up to a pitch of
perfection that is out of reach. are there not almost every day a
thousand comedies repres

all the rest of it? go on, boy, and don't mind; for so long as i fill my
pouch, no matter if i show as many inaccuracies as there are motes in a
sunbeam."

"true enough," said don quixote; and the boy went on: "see what a
numerous and glittering crowd of horsemen issues from the city in pursuit
of the two faithful lovers, what a blowing of trumpets there is, what
sounding of horns, what beating of drums and tabors; i fear me they will
overtake them and bring them back tied to the tail of their own horse,
which would be a dreadful sight."

din, thought it would be right to aid the fugitives, and standin

word, and with one bound placed himself close to the
show, and with unexampled rapidity and fury began to shower down blows on
the puppet troop of moors, knocking over some, decapitating others,
maiming this one and demolishing that; and among many more he delivered
one down stroke which, if master pedro had not ducked, made himself
small, and got out of the way, would have sliced off his head as easily
as if it had been made of almond-paste. master pedro kept shouting, "hold
hard! senor don quixote! can't you see they're not real moors you're
knocking down and killing and destroying, but only little pasteboard
figures! look--sinner that i am!--how you're wrecking and ruining all
that i'm worth!" but in spite of this, don quixote did not leave off
discharging a continuous rain of cuts, slashes, downstrokes, and
backstrokes, and at length, in less than the space of two credos, he
brought the whole show to the ground, with all its fittings and figures
shivered and knocked to pieces, k

ing marsilio badly wounded, and the
emperor charlemagne with his crown and head split in two. the whole
audience was thrown into confusion, the ape fled to the roof of the inn,
the cousin was frightened, and even sancho panza himself was in mighty
fear, for, as he swore after the storm was over, he had never seen his
master in such a furious passion.

the complete destruction of the show being thus accomplished, don quixote
became a little calmer, said, "i wish i had here before me now all those
who do not or will not believe how useful knights-errant are in the
world; just think, if i had not been here present, what would have become
of the brave don gaiferos and the fair melisendra! depend upon it, by
this time those dogs would have overtaken them and inflicted some outrage
upon them. so, then, long live knight-errantry beyond everything living
on earth this day!"

protects the fatherless, and rights wrongs, and does other charitable
deeds; but whose generous intentions have been found wanting in my case
only, blessed and praised be the highest heavens! verily, knight of the
rueful figure he must be to have disfigured mine."

sancho panza was touched by master pedro's words, and said to him, "don't
weep and lament, master pedro; you break my heart; let me tell you my
master, don quixote, is so catholic and scrupulous a christian that, if
he can make out that he has done you any wrong, he will own it, and be
willing to pay for it and make it good, and something over and above."

"only let senor don quixote pay me for some part of the work he has
destroyed," said master pedro, "and i would be content, and his worship
would ease his conscience, for he cannot be saved who keeps what is
another's against the owner's will, and makes no restitution."

"that is true," said do

"what!" returned master pedro; "and these relics lying here on the bare
hard ground--what scattered and shattered them but the invincible
strength of that mighty arm? and whose were the bodies they belonged to
but mine? and what did i get my living by but by them?"

"now am i fully convinced," said don quixote, "of what i had many a time
before believed; that the enchanters who persecute me do nothing more
than put figures like these before my eyes, and then change and turn them
into what they please. in truth and earnest, i assure you gentlemen who
now hear me, that to me everything that has taken place here seemed to
take place literally, that melisendra was melisendra, don gaiferos don

anger was roused; and to be fait

of what i intended, it is no fault of mine, but of those wicked beings
that persecute me; but, for all that, i am willing to condemn myself in
costs for this error of mine, though it did not proceed from malice; let
master pedro see what he wants for the spoiled figures, for i agree to
pay it at once in good and current money of castile."

master pedro made him a bow, saying, "i expected no less of the rare
christianity of the valiant don quixote of la mancha, true helper and
protector of all destitute and needy vagabonds; master landlord here and
the great sancho panza shall be the arbitrators and appraisers between
your worship and me of what these dilapidated figures are worth or may be
worth."

the landlord and sancho consented, and then master pedro picked up from
the ground king marsilio of saragossa with his head off, and said, "here
you see how impossible it is to restore this king to his former state, so
i think, savin

"proceed," said don quixote.

"well then, for this cleavage from top to bottom," continued master
pedro, taking up the split emperor charlemagne, "it would not be much if
i were to ask five reals and a quarter."

"it's not little," said sancho.

"nor is it much," said the landlord; "make it even, and say five reals."

"let him have the whole five and a quarter," said don quixote; "for the
sum total of this notable disaster does not stand on a quarter more or
less; and make an end of it quickly, master pedro, for it's getting on to
supper-time, and i have some hints of hunger."

"for this figure," said master pedro, "that is without a nose, and wants
an eye, and is the fair melisendra, i ask, and i am reasonable in my
charge, two reals and twelve maravedis."

"the very devil must be in it," said don quixote, "if melisendra and her
husband are not by this time

france. god help every one to his own, master pedro, and let us all
proceed fairly and honestly; and now go on."

master pedro, perceiving that don quixote was beginning to wander, and
return to his original fancy, was not disposed to let him escape, so he
said to him, "this cannot be melisendra, but must be one of the damsels
that waited on her; so if i'm given sixty maravedis for her, i'll be
content and sufficiently paid."

and so he went on, putting values on ever so many more smashed figures,
which, after the two arbitrators had adjusted them to the satisfaction of
both parties, came to forty reals and three-quarters; and over and abo

this sum, which sancho at once disbursed, master pedro asked for two
reals for his trouble in catching the ape.

"let him have them, sancho," said don quixote; "not to catch the ape, but
to get drunk; and two hundred would i give this minute for the good news,
to anyone who could tell me positively, that the lady dona melisandra and
senor don gaiferos were now in france and with their own people."

"no one could tell us that better than my ape," said master pedro; "but
there's no devil that could catch him now; i suspect, however, that
affection and hunger will drive him to come looking for me to-night; but
to-morrow will soon be here and we

in short, the puppet-show storm passed off, and all supped in peace and
good fellowship at don quixote's expense, for he was the height of
generosity. before it was daylight the man with the lances and halberds
took his departure, and soon after daybreak the cousin and the page came
to bid don quixote farewell, the former returning home, the latter
resuming his journey, towards which, to help him, don quixote gave him
twelve reals. master pedro did not care to engage in any more palaver
with don quixote, whom he knew right well; so he rose before the sun, and
having got together the remains of his show and caught his ape, he too
went off to seek his adventures. the landlord, who did not know don
quixote, was as much astonished at his mad freaks as at his generosity.
to conclude, sancho, by his master's orders, paid him very liberally, and
taking leave of him they quitted the inn at about eigh

christian taking an oath swears, or ought to swear, what is true, and

 avers, so he was telling the truth, as much as
if he swore as a catholic christian, in all he chose to write about
quixote, especially in declaring who master pedro was and what was the
divining ape that astonished all the villages with his divinations. he
says, then, that he who has read the first part of this history will
remember well enough the gines de pasamonte whom, with other galley
slaves, don quixote set free in the sierra morena: a kindness for which
he afterwards got poor thanks and worse payment from that evil-minded,
ill-conditioned set. this gines de pasamonte--don ginesillo de parapilla,
don quixote called him--it was that stole dapple from sancho panza;
which, because by the fault of the printers neither the how nor the when
was stated in the first part, has been a puzzle to a good many people,
who attribute to the bad memory of the author what was the error of the
press. in f

k him a question, not caring to pay for it, he would make
the sign to the ape and then declare that it had said so and so, which
fitted the case exactly. in this way he acquired a prodigious name and
all ran after him; on other occasions, being very crafty, he would answer
in such a way that the answers suited the questions; and as no one
cross-questioned him or pressed him to tell how his ape divined, he made
fools of them all and filled his pouch. the instant he entered the inn he
knew don quixote and sancho, and with that knowledge it was easy for him
to astonish them and all who were there; but it would have cost him dear
had don quixote brought down his hand a little lower when he cut off king
marsilio's head and destroyed all his horsemen, as related in the
preceeding chapter.

so much for master pedro and his ape; and now to return to don quixote of
la mancha. after he had left the inn he determined to visit, first of
all, the banks of the ebro and that neighbourhood, before

pproached the band near enough to see distinctly the flags,
make out the colours and distinguish the devices they bore, especially
one on a standard or ensign of white satin, on which there was painted in
a very life-like style an ass like a little sard, with its head up, its
mouth open and its tongue out, as if it were in the act and attitude of
braying; and round it were inscribed in large characters these two lines--

they did not bray in vain,
our alcaldes twain.

from this device don quixote concluded that these people must be from the
braying town, and he said so to sancho, explaining to him what was
written on the standard. at the same time he observed that the man who
had told them about the matter was wrong in saying that the two who
brayed were regidors, for according to the lines of the standard they
were alcaldes. to which sancho replied, "senor, there's nothing to stick
at in that, for maybe the regidors who brayed then came to be alcaldes of
their town afterwards, a
 
 ___________________________
 
nd so they may go by both titles; moreover, it
has nothing to do with the truth of the story whether the brayers were
alcaldes or regidors, provided at any rate they did bray; for an alcalde
is just as likely to bray as a regidor." they perceived, in short,
clearly that the town which had been twitted had turned out to do battle
with some other that had jeered it more than was fair or neighbourly.

don quixote proceeded to join them, not a little to sancho's uneasiness,
for he never relished mixing himself up in expeditions of that sort. the
members of the troop received him into the midst of them, taking him to
be some one who was on their side. don quixote, putting up his visor,
advanced with an easy bearing and demeanour to the standard with the ass,
and all the chief men of the army gathered round him to look at him,
staring at him with the usual amazement that everybody felt on seeing him

for the first time. don quixote, seeing them examining him so
attentively, and that none of them spoke to him or put any question to
him, determined to take advantage of their silence; so, breaking his own,
he lifted up his voice and said, "worthy sirs, i entreat you as earnestly
as i can not to interrupt an argument i wish to address to you, until you
find it displeases or wearies you; and if that come to pass, on the
slightest hint you give me i will put a seal upon my lips and a gag upon
my tongue."

they all bade

 him say what he liked, for they would listen to him
willingly.

with this permission don quixote went on to say, "i, sirs, am a
knight-errant whose calling is that of arms, and whose profession is to
protect those who require protection, and give help to such as stand in
need of it. some days ago i became acquainted with your misfortune and
the cause which impels you to take up arms again and again to revenge
yourselves upon your enemies; and having many times thought over your
business in my mind, i find that, according to the laws of combat, you
are mistaken in holding yourselves

was easy and his burden light; he would not, therefore, have laid any
command upon us that it was impossible to obey. thus, sirs, you are bound
to keep quiet by human and divine law."

"the devil take me," said sancho to himself at this, "but this master of
mine is a theologian; or, if not, faith, he's as like one as one egg is
like another."

don quixote stopped to take breath, and, observing that silence was still
preserved, had a mind to continue his discourse, and would have done so
had not sancho interposed with his smartness; for he, seeing his master
pause, took the lead, saying, "my lord don quixote of la mancha, who once
was called the knight of the rueful countenance, but now is called the
knight of the lions, is a gentleman of great discretion who knows latin
and his mother tongue like a bachelor, and in everything that he deals

farthings for it; and that you may see i am telling the truth, wait a bit

and then, taking hold of his nose, he began to bray so vigorously that
all the valleys around rang again.

one of those, however, that stood near him, fancying he was mocking them,
lifted up a long staff he had in his hand and smote him such a blow with
it that sancho dropped helpless to the ground. don quixote, seeing him so
roughly handled, attacked the man who had struck him lance in hand, but
so many thrust themselves between them that he could not avenge him. far
from it, finding a shower of stones rained upon him, and crossbows and
muskets unnumbered levelled at him, he wheeled rocinante round and, as
fast as his best gallop could take him, fled from the midst of them,
commending himself to god with all his heart to deliver him out of this
peril, in dread every step of some ball coming in

 at his back and coming
out at his breast, and every minute drawing his breath to see whether it
had gone from him. the members of the band, however, were satisfied with
seeing him take to flight, and did not fire on him. they put up sancho,
scarcely restored to his senses, on his ass, and let him go after his
master; not that he was sufficiently in his wits to guide the beast, but
dapple followed the footsteps of rocinante, from whom he could not remain
a moment separated. don quixote having got some way off looked back, and
seeing sancho coming, waited for him, as he perceived that no one
followed him. the men of the troop stood their ground till night, and as
the enemy did not come out to battle, they returned to their town
exulting; and had they been aware of the ancient custom of the greeks,
they would have erected a trophy on the spot.

the brave man flees, treachery is manifest and it is for wise men to
reserve themselves for better occasions. this proved to be the case with
don quixote, who, giving way before the fury of the townsfolk and the
hostile intentions of the angry troop, took to flight and, without a
thought of sancho or the danger in which he was leaving him, retreated to
such a distance as he thought made him safe. sancho, lying across his
ass, followed him, as has been said, and at length came up, having by
this time recovered his senses, and on joining him let himself drop off
dapple at rocinante's feet, sore, bruised, and belaboured. don quixote

and did not mark thee per signum crucis with a cutlass."

"i'm not equal to answering," said sancho, "for i feel as if i was
speaking through my shoulders; let us mount and get away from this; i'll
keep from braying, but not from saying that knights-errant fly and leave
their good squires to be pounded like privet, or made meal of at the
hands of their enemies."

"he does not fly who retires," returned don quixote; "for i would have
thee know, sancho, that the valour which is not based upon a foundation
of prudence is called rashness, and the exploits of the rash man are to
be attributed rather to good fortune than to courage; and so i own that i
retired, but not that i fled; and therein i have followed the example of
many valiant men who have reserved themselves for better times; the
histories are full of instances of this, but as it would not be any good

sancho was by this time mounted with the help of don quixote, who then
himself mounted rocinante, and at a leisurely pace they proceeded to take
shelter in a grove which was in sight about a quarter of a league off.
every now and then sancho gave vent to deep sighs and dismal groans, and
on don quixote asking him what caused such acute suffering, he replied
that, from the end of his back-bone up to the nape of his neck, he was so
sore that it nearly drove him out of his senses.

"the cause of that soreness," said don quixote, "will be, no doubt, that
the staff wherewith they smote thee being a very long one, it caught thee
all down the back, where all the parts that are sore are situated, and
had it reached any further thou wouldst be sorer still."

"by god," said sancho, "your worsh

must have been! of those of the present day i say nothing, because, as
your worship is one of them, i respect them, and because i know your
worship knows a point more than the devil in all you say and think."

"i would lay a good wager with you, sancho," said don quixote, "that now
that you are talking on without anyone to stop you, you don't feel a pain
in your whole body. talk away, my son, say whatever comes into your head
or mouth, for so long as you feel no pain, the irritation your
impertinences give me will be a pleasure to me; and if you are so anxious
to go home to your wife and children, god forbid that i should prevent

the rest of the time i have been sleeping on the hard ground under the
open sky, exposed to what they call the inclemencies of heaven, keeping
life in me with scraps of cheese and crusts of bread, and drinking water
either from the brooks or from the springs we come to on these by-paths
we travel."

"i own, sancho," said don quixote, "that all thou sayest is true; how
much, thinkest thou, ought i to give thee over and above what tom
carrasco gave thee?"

"i think," said sancho, "that if your worship was to add on two reals a
month i'd consider myself well paid; that is, as far as the wages of my
labour go; but to make up to me for your worship's pledge and promise to
me to give me the government of an island, it would be fair to add six
reals more, making thirty in all."

"very good," said don quixote; "it is twe

as i said before, out of your own hand."

"o body o' me!" said sancho, "but your worship is very much out in that
reckoning; for when it comes to the promise of the island we must count
from the day your worship promised it to me to this present hour we are
at now."

"well, how long is it, sancho, since i promised it to you?" said don
quixote.

"if i remember rightly," said sancho, "it must be over twenty years,
three days more or less."

don quixote gave himself a great slap on the forehead and began to laugh
heartily, and said he, "why, i have not been wandering, either in the
sierra morena or in the whole course of our sallies, but barely two
months, and thou sayest, sancho, that it is twenty years since i promised
thee the island. i believe now thou wouldst have all the money thou hast
of mine go in thy wages. if so, and if that be thy pleasure, i give it to
thee now, once and for all, and much good may it do thee, for so long as

call thee 'my lord,' thou art leaving me? thou art going now when i had a

mouth of the ass. ass thou art, ass thou wilt be, and ass thou wilt end
when the course of thy life is run; for i know it will come to its close
before thou dost perceive or discern that thou art a beast."

sancho regarded don quixote earnestly while he was giving him this
rating, and was so touched by remorse that the tears came to his eyes,
and in a piteous and broken voice he said to him, "master mine, i confess
that, to be a complete ass, all i want is a tail; if your worship will
only fix one on to me, i'll look on it as rightly placed, and i'll serve
you as an ass all the remaining days of my life. forgive me and have pity
on my folly, and remember i know but little, and, if i talk much, it's

"i should have been surprised, sancho," said don quixote, "if thou hadst
not introduced some bit of a proverb into thy speech. well, well, i
forgive thee, provided thou dost mend and not show thyself in future so
fond of thine own interest, but try to be of good cheer and take heart,
and encourage thyself to look forward to the fulfillment of my promises,
which, by being delayed, does not become impossible."

sancho said he would do so, and keep up his heart as best he could. they
then entered the grove, and don quixote settled himself at the

elm, and sancho at that of a beech, for trees of this kind and others
like them always have feet but no hands. sancho passed the night in pain,
for with the evening dews the blow of the staff made itself felt all the
more. don quixote passed it in his never-failing meditations; but, for
all that, they had some winks of sleep, and with the appearance of
daylight they pursued their journey in quest of the banks of the famous
ebro, where that befell them which will be told in the following chapter.

quitting the grove don quixote and sancho reached the river ebro, and the

t was a great delight to don quixote as he contemplated and
gazed upon the charms of its banks, the clearness of its stream, the
gentleness of its current and the abundance of its crystal waters; and
the pleasant view revived a thousand tender thoughts in his mind. above
all, he dwelt upon what he had seen in the cave of montesinos; for though
master pedro's ape had told him that of those things part was true, part
false, he clung more to their truth than to their falsehood, the very
reverse of sancho, who held them all to

as they were thus proceeding, then, they discovered a small boat, without
oars or any other gear, that lay at the water's edge tied to the stem of
a tree growing on the bank. don quixote looked all round, and seeing
nobody, at once, without more ado, dismounted from rocinante and bade
sancho get down from dapple and tie both beasts securely to the trunk of
a poplar or willow that stood there. sancho asked him the reason of this
sudden dismounting and tying. don quixote made answer, "thou must know,
sancho, that this bark is plainly, and without the possibility of any
alternative, calling and inviting me to enter it, and in it go to give
aid to some knight or other person of distinction in need of it, who is
no doubt in some sore strait; for this is the way of the books of
chivalry and of the enchanters who figure and speak in them. when a
knight is involved in some difficulty from which he cannot be delivered
save by the hand of another knight, though

proverb, 'do as thy master bids thee, and sit down to table with him;'
but for all that, for the sake of easing my conscience, i warn your
worship that it is my opinion this bark is no enchanted one, but belongs
to some of the fishermen of the river, for they catch the best shad in
the world here."

as sancho said this, he tied the beasts, leaving them to the care and
protection of the enchanters with sorrow enough in his heart. don quixote
bade him not be uneasy about deserting the animals, "for he who would
carry themselves over such longinquous roads and regions would take care
to feed them."

"i don't understand that logiquous," said sancho, "nor have i ever heard
the word all the days of my life."

"longinquous," replied don quixote, "means far off; but it is no wonder
thou dost not understand it, for thou art not bound to know latin, like
some who pretend to know it and don't."

"now they are tied," said sancho;

"what are we to do next?"

"what?" said don quixote, "cross ourselves and weigh anchor; i mean,
embark and cut the moorings by which the bark is held;" and the bark
began to drift away slowly from the bank. but when sancho saw himself
somewhere about two yards out in the river, he began to tremble and give
himself up for lost; but nothing distressed him more than hearing dapple
bray and seeing rocinante struggling to get loose, and said he to his
master, "dapple is braying in grief at our leaving him, and rocinante is
trying to escape and

 plunge in after us. o dear friends, peace be with
you, and may this madness that is taking us away from you, turned into
sober sense, bring us back to you." and with this he fell weeping so
bitterly, that don quixote said to him, sharply and angrily, "what art
thou afraid of, cowardly creature? what art thou weeping at, heart of
butter-paste? who pursues or molests thee, thou soul of a tame mouse?
what dost thou want, unsatisfied in the very heart of abundance? art
thou, perchance, tramping barefoot over the riphaean mountains, instead
of being seated on a bench like an archduke on the tranquil stream of
this pleasant river, from which in a short space we shall come out upon
the broad sea? but we mus

eight hundred leagues; and if i had here an astrolabe to take the
altitude of the pole, i could tell thee how many we have travelled,
though either i know little, or we have already crossed or shall shortly
cross the equinoctial line which parts the two opposite poles midway."

"and when we come to that line your worship speaks of," said sancho, "how
far shall we have gone?"

"very far," said don quixote, "for of the three hundred and sixty degrees
that this terraqueous globe contains, as computed by ptolemy, the
greatest cosmographer known, we shall have travelled one-half when we
come to the line i spoke of."

"by god," said sancho, "your worship gives me a nice authority for what
you say, putrid dolly something transmogrified, or whatever it is."

don quixote laughed at the interpretation sancho put upon "computed," and
the name of the cosmographer ptolemy, and said he, "thou must k

ncho; "still, i'll do as your
worship bids me; though i don't know what need there is for trying these
experiments, for i can see with my own eyes that we have not moved five
yards away from the bank, or shifted two yards from where the animals
stand, for there are rocinante and dapple in the very same place where we
left them; and watching a point, as i do now, i swear by all that's good,
we are not stirring or moving at the pace of an ant."

"try the test i told thee of, sancho," said don quixote, "and don't mind
any other, for thou knowest nothing about colures, lines, parallels,
zodiacs, ecliptics, poles, solstices, equinoxes, planets, signs,
bearings, the measures of which the celestial and terrestrial spheres are
composed; if thou wert acquainted with all these things, or any portion
of them, thou wouldst see clearly how many parallels we have cut, what
signs we have seen, and what constellations we have left behind and are
now leaving behind. but again i tell thee, feel and

hunt, for i am
certain thou art cleaner than a sheet of smooth white paper."

sancho felt, and passing his hand gently and carefully down to the hollow
of his left knee, he looked up at his master and said, "either the test
is a false one, or we have not come to where your worship says, nor
within many leagues of it."

"why, how so?" asked don quixote; "hast thou come upon aught?"

"ay, and aughts," replied sancho; and shaking his fingers he washed his
whole hand in the river along which the boat was quietly gliding in
midstream, not moved by any occult intelligence or invisible enchanter,
but simply by the current, just there smooth and gentle.

they now came in sight of some large water mills that stood in the middle
of the river, and the instant don quixote saw them he cried out, "seest
thou there, my friend? there stands the cas

tle or fortress, where there
is, no doubt, some knight in durance, or ill-used queen, or infanta, or
princess, in whose aid i am brought hither."

"what the devil city, fortress, or castle is your worship talking about,
senor?" said sancho; "don't you see that those are mills that stand in
the river to grind corn?"

"hold thy peace, sancho," said don quixote; "though they look like mills
they are not so; i have already told thee that enchantments transform
things and change their proper shapes; i do not mean to say they really
change them from one form into another, but that it seems as though they
did, as experience proved in the transformation of dulcinea, sole refuge
of my hopes."

by this time, the boat, having reached the middle of the stream, began to
move less slowly than hitherto. the millers belonging to the mills, when
they saw t

he boat coming down the river, and on the point of being sucked
in by the draught of the wheels, ran out in haste, several of them, with
long poles to stop it, and being all mealy, with faces and garments
covered with flour, they presented a sinister appearance. they raised
loud shouts, crying, "devils of men, where are you going to? are you mad?
do you want to drown yourselves, or dash yourselves to pieces among these
wheels?"

"did i not tell thee, sancho," said don quixote at this, "that we had
reached the place where i am to show what the might of my arm can do? see
what ruffians and villains come out against me; see what monsters oppose
me; see what hideous countenances come to frighten us! you shall soon
see, scoundrels!" and then standing up in the boat he began in a loud
voice to hurl threats at the millers, exclaiming, "ill-conditioned and

and so saying he drew his sword and began making passes in the air at the
millers, who, hearing but not understanding all this nonsense, strove to
stop the boat, which was now getting into the rushing channel of the
wheels. sancho fell upon his knees devoutly appealing to heaven to

quickness of the millers, who, pushing against the boat with their poles,
stopped it, not, however, without upsetting and throwing don quixote and
sancho into the water; and lucky it was for don quixote that he could
swim like a goose, though the weight of his armour carried him twice to
the bottom; and had it not been for the millers, who plunged in and
hoisted them both out, it would have been troy town with the pair of
them. as soon as, more drenched than thirsty, they were landed, sancho
went down on his knees and with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven,
prayed a long and fervent prayer to god to deliver him evermore from the
rash projects and attempts of his master. the fisher

men, the owners of
the boat, which the mill-wheels had knocked to pieces, now came up, and
seeing it smashed they proceeded to strip sancho and to demand payment
for it from don quixote; but he with great calmness, just as if nothing
had happened him, told the millers and fishermen that he would pay for
the bark most cheerfully, on condition that they delivered up to him,
free and unhurt, the person or persons that were in durance in that
castle of theirs.

"what persons or what castle art thou talking of, madman? art thou for
carrying off the people who come to grind corn in these mills?"

"that's enough," said don quixote to himself, "it would be preaching in

"with a couple more bark businesses like this we shall have sunk our
whole capital."

the fishermen and the millers stood staring in amazement at the two
figures, so very different to all appearance from ordinary men, and were
wholly unable to make out the drift of the observations and questions don
quixote addressed to them; and coming to the conclusion that they were
madmen, they left them and betook themselves, the millers to their mills,
and the fishermen to their huts. don quixote and sancho returned to their
beasts, and to their life of beasts, and so ended the adventure of the
enchanted bark.

thoughts of his love, sancho in thinking of his advancement, which just
then, it seemed to him, he was very far from securing; for, fool as he
was, he saw clearly enough that his master's acts were all or most of
them utterly senseless; and he began to cast about for an opportunity of
retiring from his service and going home some day, without entering into
any explanations or taking any farewell of him. fortune, however, ordered

it so happened that the next day towards sunset, on coming out of a wood,
don quixote cast his eyes over a green meadow, and at the far end of it
observed some people, and as he drew nearer saw that it was a hawking
party. coming closer, he distinguished among them a lady of graceful
mien, on a pure white palfrey or hackney caparisoned with green trappings
and a silver-mounted side-saddle. the lady was also in green, and so
richly and splendidly dressed that splendour itself seemed personified in
her. on her left hand she bore a hawk, a proof to don quixote's mind that

"you've got a likely one here to thrust any in!" said sancho; "leave me
alone for that! why, this is not the first time in my life i have carried
messages to high and exalted ladies."

"except that thou didst carry to the lady dulcinea," said don quixote, "i
know not that thou hast carried any other, at least in my service."

"that is true," replied sancho; "but pledges don't distress a good payer,
and in a house where there's plenty supper is soon cooked; i mean there's
no need of telling or warning me about anything; for i'm ready for
everything and know a little of everything."

and god speed thee."

 as much by the beauty of the good lady as by her
high-bred air and her courtesy, but, above all, by what she had said
about having heard of his master, the knight of the rueful countenance;
for if she did not call him knight of the lions it was no doubt because
he had so lately taken the name. "tell me, brother squire," asked the
duchess (whose title, however, is not known), "this master of yours, is
he not one of whom there is a history extant in print, called 'the
ingenious gentleman, don quixote of la mancha,' who has for the lady of
his heart a certain dulcinea del toboso?"

"he is the same, senora," replied sancho; "and that squire of his who
figures, or ought to figure, in the said history under the name of sancho
panza, is myself, unless they have changed me in the cradle, i mean in
the press."

"i am rejoiced at all this," said the duchess; "go, brother panza, and
tell your master that he is welcome to my estate, and that nothing could
happen to me that could give me gre

ater pleasure."

sancho returned to his master mightily pleased with this gratifying
answer, and told him all the great lady had said to him, lauding to the
skies, in his rustic phrase, her rare beauty, her graceful gaiety, and
her courtesy. don quixote drew himself up briskly in his saddle, fixed
himself in his stirrups, settled his visor, gave rocinante the spur, and
with an easy bearing advanced to kiss the hands of the duchess, who,
having sent to summon the duke her husband, told him while don quixote
was approaching all about the message; and as both of them had read the
first part of this history, and from it were aware of don quixote's crazy
turn, they awaited him with the greatest delight and anxiety to make his
acquaintance, m

eaning to fall in with his humour and agree with
everything he said, and, so long as he stayed with them, to treat him as
a knight-errant, with all the ceremonies usual in the books of chivalry
they had read, for they themselves were very fond of them.

don quixote now came up with his visor raised, and as he seemed about to
dismount sancho made haste to go and hold his stirrup for him; but in
getting down off dapple he was so unlucky as to hitch his foot in one of
the ropes of the pack-saddle in such a way that he was unable to free it,
and was left hanging by it with his face and breast on the ground. don
quixote, who was not used to dismount without having the stirrup held,
fancying that sancho had by this time come to hold it for him, threw
him

self off with a lurch and brought rocinante's saddle after him, which
was no doubt badly girthed, and saddle and he both came to the ground;
not without discomfiture to him and abundant curses muttered between his
teeth against the unlucky sancho, who had his foot still in the shackles.
the duke ordered his huntsmen to go to the help of knight and squire, and
they raised don quixote, sorely shaken by his fall; and he, limping,
advanced as best he could to kneel before the noble pair. this, however,
the duke would by no means permit; on the contrary, dismounting from his
horse, he went and embraced don quixote, saying, "i am grieved, sir
knight of the rueful countenance, that your first experience on my ground
should have been such an unfortunate one as we have seen; but the
carelessness of squires is often the cause of worse accidents."

"that which has happened me

s of the bottomless pit, for the glory of having seen you would
have lifted me up and delivered me from it. my squire, god's curse upon
him, is better at unloosing his tongue in talking impertinence than in
tightening the girths of a saddle to keep it steady; but however i may
be, fallen or raised up, on foot or on horseback, i shall always be at
your service and that of my lady the duchess, your worthy consort, worthy
queen of beauty and paramount princess of courtesy."

"gently, senor don quixote of la mancha," said the duke; "where my lady
dona dulcinea del toboso is, it is not right that other beauties should
be praised."

sancho, by this time released from his entanglement, was standing by, and
before his master could answer he said, "there is no denying, and it must
be maintained, that my lady dulcinea del toboso is very beautiful; but
the hare jumps up where one least expects it; and i have heard say that
what we call nature is like a potter that makes vessels of clay, and

who makes one fair vessel can as well make two, or three, or a hundred; i
say so because, by my faith, my lady the duchess is in no way behind my
mistress the lady dulcinea del toboso."

don quixote turned to the duchess and said, "your highness may conceive
that never had knight-errant in this world a more talkative or a droller
squire than i have, and he will prove the truth of what i say, if your
highness is pleased to accept of my services for a few days."

to which the duchess made answer, "that worthy sancho is droll i consider
a very good thing, because it is a sign that he is shrewd; for drollery
and sprightliness, senor don quixote, as you very well know, do not take

to finding in her castle what he had found in don diego's house and in
basilio's; he was always fond of good living, and always seized by the
forelock any opportunity of feasting himself whenever it presented
itself. the history informs us, then, that before they reached the
country house or castle, the duke went on in advance and instructed all
his servants how they were to treat don quixote; and so the instant he
came up to the castle gates with the duchess, two lackeys or equerries,
clad in what they call morning gowns of fine crimson satin reaching to
their feet, hastened out, and catching don quixote in their arms before
he saw or heard them, said to him, "your highness should go and take my
lady the duchess off her horse."

don quixote obeyed, and great bandying of compliments followed between
the two over the matter; but in the end the duchess's determination

 the day, and she refused to get down or dismount from her palfrey
except in the arms of the duke, saying she did not consider herself
worthy to impose so unnecessary a burden on so great a knight. at length
the duke came out to take her down, and as they entered a spacious court
two fair damsels came forward and threw over don quixote's shoulders a
large mantle of the finest scarlet cloth, and at the same instant all the
galleries of the court were lined with the men-servants and
women-servants of the household, crying, "welcome, flower and cream of
knight-errantry!" while all or most of them flung pellets filled with
scented water over don quixote and the duke and duchess; at all which don
quixote was greatly astonished, and this was the first time that he
thoroughly felt and believed himself to be a knight-errant in

that could be offered me;" and addressing sancho, she said to him, "you
must know, friend sancho, that dona rodriguez is very youthful, and that
she wears that hood more for authority and custom's sake than because of
her years."

"may all the rest of mine be unlucky," said sancho, "if i meant it that
way; i only spoke because the affection i have for my ass is so great,
and i thought i could not commend him to a more kind-hearted person than
the lady dona rodriguez."

don quixote, who was listening, said to him, "is this proper conversation
for the place, sancho?"

"senor," replied sancho, "every one must mention what he wants wherever
he may be; i thought of dapple here, and i spoke of him here; if i had
thought of him in the stable i would have spoken there."

on which the duke observed, "sancho is quite right, and there is no
reason at all to find fault with him; dapple shall be fed to his heart's
content, and sancho may rest easy, for he shall be treated li

ke himself."

while this conversation, amusing to all except don quixote, was
proceeding, they ascended the staircase and ushered don quixote into a
chamber hung with rich cloth of gold and brocade; six damsels relieved
him of his armour and waited on him like pages, all of them prepared and
instructed by the duke and duchess as to what they were to do, and how
they were to treat don quixote, so that he might see and believe they
were treating him like a knight-errant. when his armour was removed,
there stood don quixote in his tight-fitting breeches and chamois
doublet, lean, lanky, and long, with cheeks that seemed to be kissing
each other inside; such a figure, that if the damsels waiting on him had
not taken care to check their merriment (which was one of the particular
directions their master and mistress had given them), they would have
burst with laughter. they asked

thy words before they escape thy mouth, and bear in mind we are now in
quarters whence, by god's help, and the strength of my arm, we shall come
forth mightily advanced in fame and fortune."

sancho promised him with much earnestness to keep his mouth shut, and to
bite off his tongue before he uttered a word that was not altogether to
the purpose and well considered, and told him he might make his mind easy
on that point, for it should never be discovered through him what they
were.

don quixote dressed himself, put on his baldric with his sword, threw the
scarlet mantle over his shoulders, placed on his head a montera of green
satin that the damsels had given him, and thus arrayed passed out into
the large room, where he found the damsels drawn up in double file, the
same number on each side, all with the appliances for washing the hands,
which they presented to him with profuse obeisances and ceremonies. then
came twelve pages, together with the seneschal, to lead him to dinner

eing born magnates themselves, never know how to

the greatness of great folk measured by their own narrowness of mind; one
of those who, when they try to introduce economy into the household they
rule, lead it into meanness. one of this sort, i say, must have been the
grave churchman who came out with the duke and duchess to receive don
quixote.

a vast number of polite speeches were exchanged, and at length, taking
don quixote between them, they proceeded to sit down to table. the duke
pressed don quixote to take the head of the table, and, though he
refused, the entreaties of the duke were so urgent that he had to accept
it.

the ecclesiastic took his seat opposite to him, and the duke and duchess
those at the sides. all this time sancho stood by, gaping with amazement
at the honour he saw shown to his master by these illustrious persons;
and observing all the ceremonious pressing that had passed between the

table, he said, "if your worship will give me leave i will tell you a
story of what happened in my village about this matter of seats."

the moment sancho said this don quixote trembled, making sure that he was
about to say something foolish. sancho glanced at him, and guessing his
thoughts, said, "don't be afraid of my going astray, senor, or saying
anything that won't be pat to the purpose; i haven't forgotten the advice
your worship gave me just now about talking much or little, well or ill."

"i have no recollection of anything, sancho," said don quixote; "say what
thou wilt, only say it quickly."

"well then," said sancho, "what i am going to say is so t

"lie as much as thou wilt for all i care, sancho," said don quixote, "for
i am not going to stop thee, but consider what thou art going to say."

"i have so considered and reconsidered," said sancho, "that the
bell-ringer's in a safe berth; as will be seen by what follows."

"it would be well," said don quixote, "if your highnesses would order
them to turn out this idiot, for he will talk a heap of nonsense."

"by the life of the duke, sancho shall not be taken away from me for a
moment," said the duchess; "i am very fond of him, for i know he is very
discreet."

"discreet be the days of your holiness," said sancho, "for the good
opinion you have of my wit, though there's none in me; but the story i
want to tell is this. there was an invitation given by a gentleman of my

our village, that my master don quixote was mixed up in, to the best of
my belief, that tomasillo the scapegrace, the son of balbastro the smith,
was wounded in.--isn't all this true, master mine? as you live, say so,
that these gentlefolk may not take me for some lying chatterer."

"so far," said the ecclesiastic, "i take you to be more a chatterer than
a liar; but i don't know what i shall take you for by-and-by."

"thou citest so many witnesses and proofs, sancho," said don quixote,
"that i have no choice but to say thou

ou live, my son," said the churchman, "make haste back from
tembleque, and finish your story without burying the gentleman, unless
you want to make more funerals."

"well then, it so happened," said sancho, "that as the pair of them were
going to sit down to table--and i think i can see them now plainer than
ever-"

great was the enjoyment the duke and duchess derived from the irritation
the worthy churchman showed at the long-winded, halting way sancho had of
telling his story, while don quixote was chafing with rage and vexation.

"so, as i was saying," continued sancho, "as the pair of them were going
to sit down to table, as i said, the labourer insisted upon the
gentleman's taking the head of the table, and the gentleman insisted upon
the labourer's taking it, as his orders should be obeyed in his house;
but the labourer, who plumed himself on his politeness and good breeding,
would not on any account, until the gentleman, out of patience, putting
his hands on his shoulders

, compelled him by force to sit down, saying,
'sit down, you stupid lout, for wherever i sit will be the head to you;
and that's the story, and, troth, i think it hasn't been brought in amiss
here."

don quixote turned all colours, which, on his sunburnt face, mottled it
till it looked like jasper. the duke and duchess suppressed their
laughter so as not altogether to mortify don quixote, for they saw
through sancho's impertinence; and to change the conversation, and keep
sancho from uttering more absurdities, the duchess asked don quixote what
news he had of the lady dulcinea, and if he had sent her any presents of
giants or miscreants lately, for he could not but have vanquished a good
many.

to which don quixote replied, "senora, my misfortunes, though they had a
beginning, will never have an end. i have vanquished giants and i have
sent her caitiffs and miscreants;

"have you seen her enchanted, sancho?" asked the duke.

"what, seen her!" said sancho; "why, who the devil was it but myself that
first thought of the enchantment business? she is as much enchanted as my
father."

the ecclesiastic, when he heard them talking of giants and caitiffs and
enchantments, began to suspect that this must be don quixote of la
mancha, whose story the duke was always reading; and he had himself often
reproved him for it, telling him it was foolish to read such fooleries;
and becoming convinced that his suspicion was correct, addressing the
duke, he said very angrily to him, "senor, your excellence will have to
give account to god for what this good man does. this don quixote, or don
simpleton, or whatever his name is, cannot, i imagine, be such a
blockhead as your excellence would have him, holding out en

mancha, or enchanted dulcineas, or all the rest of the silly things they
tell about you?"

don quixote listened attentively to the reverend gentleman's words, and
as soon as he perceived he had done speaking, regardless of the presence
of the duke and duchess, he sprang to his feet with angry looks and an
agitated countenance, and said--but the reply deserves a chapter to

"no, sancho my friend, certainly not," said the duke, "for in the name of
senor don quixote i confer upon you the government of one of no small
importance that i have at my disposal."

"go down on thy knees, sancho," said don quixote, "and kiss the feet of
his excellence for the favour he has bestowed upon thee."

sancho obeyed, and on seeing this the ecclesiastic stood up from table
completely out of temper, exclaiming, "by the gown i wear, i am almost
inclined to say that your excellence is as great a fool as these sinners.

their madness! i leave your excellence with them, for so long as they are
in the house, i will remain in my own, and spare myself the trouble of
reproving what i cannot remedy;" and without uttering another word, or
eating another morsel, he went off, the entreaties of the duke and
duchess being entirely unavailing to stop him; not that the duke said
much to him, for he could not, because of the laughter his uncalled-for
anger provoked.

when he had done laughing, he said to don quixote, "you have replied on
your own behalf so stoutly, sir knight of the lions, that there is no
occasion to seek further satisfaction for this, which, though it may look
like an offence, is not so at all, for, as women can give no offence, no
more can ecclesiastics, as you very well know."

"that is true," said don quixote, "and the reason is, that he who is not
liable to offence cannot give offence to anyone. women, children, and
ecclesiastics, as they cannot defend themselves, though they

by my faith, i'm certain if reinaldos of montalvan had heard the little
man's words he would have given him such a spank on the mouth that he
wouldn't have spoken for the next three years; ay, let him tackle them,
and he'll see how he'll get out of their hands!"

the duchess, as she listened to sancho, was ready to die with laughter,
and in her own mind she set him down as droller and madder than his
master; and there were a good many just then who were of the same
opinion.

don quixote finally grew calm, and dinner came to an end, and as the
cloth was removed four damsels came in, one of them with a silver basin,
another with a jug also of silver, a third with two fine white towels on
her shoulder, and the fourth with her arms bared to the elbows, and in
her white hands (for white they certainly were) a round ball of naples
soap. the one with the basin approached, and with arch composure and
impudence, thrust it under don quixote's chin, who, wondering at such a

rd briskly, raising snow-flakes, for
the soap lather was no less white, not only over the beard, but all over
the face, and over the eyes of the submissive knight, so that they were
perforce obliged to keep shut. the duke and duchess, who had not known
anything about this, waited to see what came of this strange washing. the
barber damsel, when she had him a hand's breadth deep in lather,
pretended that there was no more water, and bade the one with the jug go
and fetch some, while senor don quixote waited. she did so, and don
quixote was left the strangest and most ludicrous figure that could be
imagined. all those present, and there were a good many, were watching
him, and as they saw him there with half a yard of neck, and that
uncommonly brown, his eyes shut, and his beard full of soap, it was a
great wonder, and only by great discretion, that they were able to
restrain their laughter. the damsels, the concocters of the joke, kept
their eyes down, not daring to look at their mas

ter and mistress; and as
for them, laughter and anger struggled within them, and they knew not
what to do, whether to punish the audacity of the girls, or to reward
them for the amusement they had received from seeing don quixote in such
a plight.

at length the damsel with the jug returned and they made an end of
washing don quixote, and the one who carried the towels very deliberately
wiped him and dried him; and all four together making him a profound
obeisance and curtsey, they were about to go, when the duke, lest don
quixote should see through the joke, called out to the one with the basin
saying, "come and wash me, and take care that there is water enough." the
girl, sharp-witted and prompt, came and placed the basin for the duke as
she had done for don quixote, and they soon had him well soaped and
washed, an

it appeared afterwards that the duke had sworn that if they had not
washed him as they had don quixote he would have punished them for their
impudence, which they adroitly atoned for by soaping him as well.

sancho observed the ceremony of the washing very attentively, and said to
himself, "god bless me, if it were only the custom in this country to
wash squires' beards too as well as knights'. for by god and upon my soul
i want it badly; and if they gave me a scrape of the razor besides i'd
take it as a still greater kindness."

"what are you saying to yourself, sancho?" asked the duch
 
 ___________________________
 
ill take care
that my damsels wash you, and even put you in the tub if necessary."

"i'll be content with the beard," said sancho, "at any rate for the
present; and as for the future, god has decreed what is to be."

"attend to worthy sancho's request, seneschal," said the duchess, "and do
exactly what he wishes."

the seneschal replied that senor sancho should be obeyed in everything;
and with that he went away to dinner and took sancho along with him,
while the duke and duchess and don quixote remained at table discussing a
great variety of things, but all bearing on the calling of arms and
knight-errantry.

the duchess begged don quixote, as he seemed to have a retentive memory,
to describe and portray to her the beauty and features of the lady
dulcinea del toboso, for, judging by what fame trumpeted abroad of her
beauty, she felt sure she must be the fairest creature in the world, nay,
in all la mancha.

don quixote sighed on hearing the duchess's request, and said, "if i

uld see her
portrayed in full. but why should i attempt to depict and describe in
detail, and feature by feature, the beauty of the peerless dulcinea, the
burden being one worthy of other shoulders than mine, an enterprise
wherein the pencils of parrhasius, timantes, and apelles, and the graver
of lysippus ought to be employed, to paint it in pictures and carve it in
marble and bronze, and ciceronian and demosthenian eloquence to sound its
praises?"

"what does demosthenian mean, senor don quixote?" said the duchess; "it
is a word i never heard in all my life."

"demosthenian eloquence," said don quixote, "means the eloquence of
demosthenes, as ciceronian means that of cicero, who were the two most
eloquent orators in the world."

"true," said the duke; "you must have lost your wits to ask such a
question. nevertheless, senor don quixote would greatly gratify us if he
would depict her to us; for never fear, even in an outline or sketch she
will be something to make the fairest

envious."

"i would do so certainly," said don quixote, "had she not been blurred to
my mind's eye by the misfortune that fell upon her a short time since,
one of such a nature that i am more ready to weep over it than to
describe it. for your highnesses must know that, going a few days back to
kiss her hands and receive her benediction, approbation, and permission
for this third sally, i found her altogether a different being from the
one i sought; i found her enchanted and changed from a princess into a
peasant, from fair to foul, from an

angel into a devil, from fragrant to
pestiferous, from refined to clownish, from a dignified lady into a
jumping tomboy, and, in a word, from dulcinea del toboso into a coarse
sayago wench."

"god bless me!" said the duke aloud at this, "who can have done the world
such an injury? who can have robbed it of the beauty that gladdened it,
of the grace and gaiety that charmed it, of the modesty that shed a
lustre upon it?"

"who?" replied don quixote; "who could it be but some malignant enchanter
of the many that persecute me out of envy--that accursed race born into
the world to obscure and bring to naught the achievements of the good,
and glorify and exalt the deeds of the wicked? enchanters have persecuted
me, enchanters persecute me still, and enchanters will continue to
persecute me until they have sunk me and my lofty chivalry in the deep
abyss of oblivion; and they injure and wound me where they know i feel it
most. for to dep

rive a knight-errant of his lady is to deprive him of the
eyes he sees with, of the sun that gives him light, of the food whereby
he lives. many a time before have i said it, and i say it now once more,
a knight-errant without a lady is like a tree without leaves, a building
without a foundation, or a shadow without the body that causes it."

"there is no denying it," said the duchess; "but still, if we are to
believe the history of don quixote that has come out here lately with
general applause, it is to be inferred from it, if i mistake not, that
you never saw the lady dulcinea, and that the said lady is nothing in the
world but an imaginary lady, one that you yourself begot and gave birth
to in your brain, and adorned with whatever charms and perfections you
chose."

"there is a good deal to be said on that point," said don quixote; "god
knows whether there be any dulcinea or not in the world, or whether she
is imaginary o

ven birth to
my lady, though i behold her as she needs must be, a lady who contains in
herself all the qualities to make her famous throughout the world,
beautiful without blemish, dignified without haughtiness, tender and yet
modest, gracious from courtesy and courteous from good breeding, and
lastly, of exalted lineage, because beauty shines forth and excels with a
higher degree of perfection upon good blood than in the fair of lowly
birth."

"that is true," said the duke; "but senor don quixote will give me leave
to say what i am constrained to say by the story of his exploits that i
have read, from which it is to be inferred that, granting there is a
dulcinea in el toboso, or out of it, and that she is in the highest
degree beautiful as you have described her to us, as regards the
loftiness of her lineage she is not on a par with the orianas,
alastrajareas, madasimas, or others of that sort, with whom, as you well
know, the histories abound."

"to that i may reply," said don
 
 ___________________________
 
 quixote, "that dulcinea is the daughter
of her own works, and that virtues rectify blood, and that lowly virtue
is more to be regarded and esteemed than exalted vice. dulcinea, besides,
has that within her that may raise her to be a crowned and sceptred
queen; for the merit of a fair and virtuous woman is capable of
performing greater miracles; and virtually, though not formally, she has
in herself higher fortunes."

"i protest, senor don quixote," said the duchess, "that in all you say,
you go most cautiously and lead in hand, as the saying is; henceforth i
will believe myself, and i will take care that everyone in my house
believes, even my lord the duke if needs be, that there is a dulcinea in
el toboso, and that she is living to-day, and that she is beautiful and
nobly born and deserves to have such a knight as senor don quixote in her
service, and that is the highest praise that it is in my power to give
her or that i can th

ink of. but i cannot help entertaining a doubt, and
having a certain grudge against sancho panza; the doubt is this, that the
aforesaid history declares that the said sancho panza, when he carried a
letter on your worship's behalf to the said lady dulcinea, found her
sifting a sack of wheat; and more by token it says it was red wheat; a
thing which makes me doubt the loftiness of her lineage."

to this don quixote made answer, "senora, your highness must know that
everything or almost everything that happens me transcends the ordinary
limits of what happens to other knights-errant; whether it be that it is
directed by the inscrutable will of destiny, or by the malice of some
jealous enchanter. now it is an established fact that all or most famous
knights-errant have some special gift, one that of being proof against
enchantment, another that of being made of such invulnerable flesh that
he cannot

right in all things, for they will never be at a loss for persons to
advise and direct them in what they have to do, like those
knight-governors who, being no lawyers, pronounce sentences with the aid
of an assessor. my advice to him will be to take no bribe and surrender
no right, and i have some other little matters in reserve, that shall be
produced in due season for sancho's benefit and the advantage of the
island he is to govern."

the duke, duchess, and don quixote had reached this point in their
conversation, when they heard voices and a great hubbub in the palace,
and sancho burst abruptly into the room all glowing with anger, with a
straining-cloth by way of a bib, and followed by several servants, or,
more properly speaking, kitchen-boys and other underlings, one of whom
carried a small trough full of water, that from its colour and impurity
was plainly dishwater. the one with the trough pursued him and followed
him everywhere he went, endeavou

sunk in his skull; for cirimonies and soapings of this sort are more like
jokes than the polite attentions of one's host."

the duchess was ready to die with laughter when she saw sancho's rage and
heard his words; but it was no pleasure to don quixote to see him in such
a sorry trim, with the dingy towel about him, and the hangers-on of the
kitchen all round him; so making a low bow to the duke and duchess, as if
to ask their permission to speak, he addressed the rout in a dignified
tone: "holloa, gentlemen! you let that youth alone, and go back to where
you came from, or anywhere else if you like; my squire is as clean as any
other person, and those troughs are as bad as narrow thin-necked jars to
him; take my advice and leave him al

children, and i am serving as a squire; if in any one of these ways i can
serve your highness, i will not be longer in obeying than your grace in

"it is easy to see, sancho," replied the duchess, "that you have learned
to be polite in the school of politeness itself; i mean to say it is easy
to see that you have been nursed in the bosom of senor don quixote, who
is, of course, the cream of good breeding and flower of ceremony--or
cirimony, as you would say yourself. fair be the fortunes of such a
master and such a servant, the one the cynosure of knight-errantry, the
other the star of squirely fidelity! rise, sancho, my friend; i will
repay your courtesy by taking care that my lord the duke makes good to
you the promised gift of the government as soon as possible."

with this, the conversation came to an end, and don quixote retired to

duchess begged sancho, unless he had a

the day in summer, to serve her excellence he would try with all his
might not to sleep even one that day, and that he would come in obedience
to her command, and with that he went off. the duke gave fresh orders
with respect to treating don quixote as a knight-errant, without
departing even in smallest particular from the style in which, as the
stories tell us, they used to treat the knights of old.

respects he was worthy of even
the chair of the cid ruy diaz the campeador. sancho shrugged his
shoulders, obeyed, and sat down, and all the duchess's damsels and
duennas gathered round him, waiting in profound silence to hear what he
would say. it was the duchess, however, who spoke first, saying:

"now that we are alone, and that there is nobody here to overhear us, i
should be glad if the senor governor would relieve me of certain doubts i
have, rising out of the history of the great don quixote that is now in
print. one is: inasmuch as worthy sancho never saw dulcinea, i mean the
lady dulcinea del toboso, nor took don quixote's letter to her, for it
was left in the memorandum book in the sierra morena, how did he dare to
invent the answer and all that about finding her sifting wheat, the whole
story being a deception and falsehood, and so much to the prejudice of
the peerless dulcinea's good name, a thing that is not at all becoming
the character and fidelity of a good squire?"

without uttering one in reply, got up from his
chair, and with noiseless steps, with his body bent and his finger on his
lips, went all round the room lifting up the hangings; and this done, he
came back to his seat and said, "now, senora, that i have seen that there
is no one except the bystanders listening to us on the sly, i will answer
what you have asked me, and all you may ask me, without fear or dread.
and the first thing i have got to say is, that for my own part i hold my
master don quixote to be stark mad, though sometimes he says things that,
to my mind, and indeed everybody's that listens to him, are so wise, and
run in such a straight furrow, that satan himself could not have said
them better; but for all that, really, and beyond all question, it's my
firm belief he is cracked. well, then, as this is clear to my mind, i can
venture to make him believe things that have neither head nor tail, like
that affair of the answer to the letter, and that other of six or eight

 no one is born ready
taught, and the bishops are made out of men and not out of stones. but to
return to the subject we were discussing just now, the enchantment of the
lady dulcinea, i look upon it as certain, and something more than
evident, that sancho's idea of practising a deception upon his master,
making him believe that the peasant girl was dulcinea and that if he did
not recognise her it must be because she was enchanted, was all a device
of one of the enchanters that persecute don quixote. for in truth and
earnest, i know from good authority that the coarse country wench who
jumped up on the ass was and is dulcinea del toboso, and that worthy
sancho, though he fancies himself the deceiver, is the one that is
deceived; and that there is no more reason to doubt the truth of this,
than of anything else we never saw. senor sancho panza must know that we
too have enchanters here that are well disposed to us, and tell us what
goes on in the world, plainly and distinctly, withou

him; and if it has turned out differently, there is a god in heaven who
judges our hearts."

"that is true," said the duchess; "but tell me, sancho, what is this you
say about the cave of montesinos, for i should like to know."

sancho upon this related to her, word for word, what has been said
already touching that adventure, and having heard it the duchess said,
"from this occurrence it may be inferred that, as the great don quixote
says he saw there the same country wench sancho saw on the way from el
toboso, it is, no doubt, dulcinea, and that there are some very active
and exceedingly busy enchanters about."

"so i say," said sancho, "and if my lady dulcinea is enchanted, so much
the worse for her, and i'm not going to pick a quarrel with my master's
enemies, who seem to be many and spiteful. the truth is that the one i
saw was a country wench, and i set her down to be a country wench; and if
that was dulcinea

from work and pension him off."

"don't think, senora duchess, that you have said anything absurd," said
sancho; "i have seen more than two asses go to governments, and for me to
take mine with me would be nothing new."

sancho's words made the duchess laugh again and gave her fresh amusement,
and dismissing him to sleep she went away to tell the duke the
conversation she had had with him, and between them they plotted and
arranged to play a joke upon don quixote that was to be a rare one and
entirely in knight-errantry style, and in that same style they practised
several upon him, so much in keeping and so clever that they form the
best adventures this great history contains.

s, in order to
play him a famous one. but what the duchess marvelled at above all was
that sancho's simplicity could be so great as to make him believe as
absolute truth that dulcinea had been enchanted, when it was he himself
who had been the enchanter and trickster in the business. having,
therefore, instructed their servants in everything they were to do, six
days afterwards they took him out to hunt, with as great a retinue of
huntsmen and beaters as a crowned king.

they presented don quixote with a hunting suit, and sancho with another
of the finest green cloth; but don quixote declined to put his on, saying
that he must soon return to the hard pursuit of arms, and could not carry
wardrobes or stores with him. sancho, however, took what they gave him,
meaning to sell it at the first opportunity.

the appointed day having arrived, don quixote armed himself, and sancho
arrayed himself, and mounted on his dapple (for he would not give him up
though they offered him a horse), h

nd at last they reached a wood
that lay between two high mountains, where, after occupying various
posts, ambushes, and paths, and distributing the party in different
positions, the hunt began with great noise, shouting, and hallooing, so
that, between the baying of the hounds and the blowing of the horns, they
could not hear one another. the duchess dismounted, and with a sharp
boar-spear in her hand posted herself where she knew the wild boars were
in the habit of passing. the duke and don quixote likewise dismounted and
placed themselves one at each side of her. sancho took up a position in
the rear of all without dismounting from dapple, whom he dared not desert
lest some mischief should befall him. scarcely had they taken their stand
in a line with several of their servants, when they saw a huge boar,
closely pressed by the hounds and followed by the huntsmen, making
towards them, grinding his teeth and tusks, and scattering foam from his
mouth. as soon as he saw him don quixot

oak, he hung suspended in the air unable to reach the ground.
finding himself in this position, and that the green coat was beginning
to tear, and reflecting that if the fierce animal came that way he might
be able to get at him, he began to utter such cries, and call for help so
earnestly, that all who heard him and did not see him felt sure he must
be in the teeth of some wild beast. in the end the tusked boar fell
pierced by the blades of the many spears they held in front of him; and
don quixote, turning round at the cries of sancho, for he knew by them
that it was he, saw him hanging from the oak head downwards, with dapple,
who did not forsake him in his distress, close beside him; and cide
hamete observes that he seldom saw sancho panza without seeing dapple, or
dapple without seeing sancho panza; such was their attachment and loyalty
one to the other. don quixote went over and unhooked sancho, who, as soon
as he found himself on the ground, looked at the rent in his huntingco

magnificence of those who had provided it. sancho, as he
showed the rents in his torn suit to the duchess, observed, "if we had
been hunting hares, or after small birds, my coat would have been safe
from being in the plight it's in; i don't know what pleasure one can find
in lying in wait for an animal that may take your life with his tusk if
he gets at you. i recollect having heard an old ballad sung that says,

  by bears be thou devoured, as erst
  was famous favila."

"that," said don quixote, "was a gothic king, who, going a-hunting, was
devoured by a bear."

"just so," said sancho; "and i would not have kings and princes expose
themselves to such dangers for the sake of a pleasure which, to my mind,
ought not to be one, as it consists in killing an animal that has done no
harm whatever."

"quite the contrary, sancho; you are wrong there," said the duke; "for
hunting is more suitable and requisite for kings and princes than for
anybody else. the chase is the emblem of war

"be that as it may," said sancho, "'pledges don't distress a good payer,'
and 'he whom god helps does better than he who gets up early,' and 'it's
the tripes that carry the feet and not the feet the tripes;' i mean to
say that if god gives me help and i do my duty honestly, no doubt i'll
govern better than a gerfalcon. nay, let them only put a finger in my
mouth, and they'll see whether i can bite or not."

"the curse of god and all his saints upon thee, thou accursed sancho!"
exclaimed don quixote; "when will the day come--as i have often said to
thee--when i shall hear thee make one single coherent, rational remark
without proverbs? pray, your highnesses, leave this fool alone, for he
will grind your souls between, not to say two, but two thousand proverbs,
dragged in as much in season, and as much to the purpose as--may god
grant as much health to him, or to me if i want to listen to them!"

fire and the noise of the warlike instruments almost blinded the eyes and
deafened the ears of those that stood by, and indeed of all who were in
the wood. then there were heard repeated lelilies after the fashion of
the moors when they rush to battle; trumpets and clarions brayed, drums
beat, fifes played, so unceasingly and so fast that he could not have had
any senses who did not lose them with the confused din of so many
instruments. the duke was astounded, the duchess amazed, don quixote
wondering, sancho panza trembling, and indeed, even they who were aware
of the cause were frightened. in their fear, silence fell upon them, and
a postillion, in the guise of a demon, passed in front of them, blowing,
in lieu of a bugle, a huge hollow horn that gave out a horrible hoarse
note.

"ho there! brother courier," cried the duke, "who are you? where are you
going? what troops are these that seem to be passing through the wood?"

to which the courier replied in a harsh, discor

this way are six troops of enchanters, who are bringing on a triumphal
car the peerless dulcinea del toboso; she comes under enchantment,
together with the gallant frenchman montesinos, to give instructions to
don quixote as to how, she the said lady, may be disenchanted."

"if you were the devil, as you say and as your appearance indicates,"
said the duke, "you would have known the said knight don quixote of la
mancha, for you have him here before you."

"by god and upon my conscience," said the devil, "i never observed it,
for my mind is occupied with so many different things that i was
forgetting the main thing i came about."

"this demon must be an honest fellow and a good christian," said sancho;
"for if he wasn't he wouldn't swear by god and his conscience; i feel
sure now there must be good souls even in hell itself."

they call dulcinea del toboso, that he may show thee what is needful in
order to disenchant her; and as i came for no more i need stay no longer;
demons of my sort be with thee, and good angels with these gentles;" and
so saying he blew his huge horn, turned about and went off without
waiting for a reply from anyone.

they all felt fresh wonder, but particularly sancho and don quixote;
sancho to see how, in defiance of the truth, they would have it that
dulcinea was enchanted; don quixote because he could not feel sure
whether what had happened to him in the cave of montesinos was true or
not; and as he was deep in these cogitations the duke said to him, "do
you mean to wait, senor don quixote?"

"why not?" replied he; "here will i wait, fearless and firm, though all
hell should come to attack me."

going on at the same time; in one quarter resounded the dull noise of a
terrible cannonade, in another numberless muskets were being discharged,
the shouts of the combatants sounded almost close at hand, and farther
away the moorish lelilies were raised again and again. in a word, the
bugles, the horns, the clarions, the trumpets, the drums, the cannon, the
musketry, and above all the tremendous noise of the carts, all made up
together a din so confused and terrific that don quixote had need to
summon up all his courage to brave it; but sancho's gave way, and he fell
fainting on the skirt of the duchess's robe, who let him lie there and
promptly bade them throw water in his face. this was done, and he came to
himself by the time that one of the carts with the creaking wheels
reached the spot. it was drawn by four plodding oxen all covered with
black housings; on each horn they had fixed a large lighted wax taper,
and on the top of the cart was constructed a raised s

it to be a good sign; and said he to the duchess, from whom he did not
stir a step, or for a single instant, "senora, where there's music there
can't be mischief."

"nor where there are lights and it is bright," said the duchess; to which
sancho replied, "fire gives light, and it's bright where there are
bonfires, as we see by those that are all round us and perhaps may burn
us; but music is a sign of mirth and merrymaking."

"that remains to be seen," said don quixote, who was listening to all
that passed; and he was right, as is shown in the following chapter.

texture of which did not prevent the fair features of a maiden from being
distinguished, while the numerous lights made it possible to judge of her
beauty and of her years, which seemed to be not less than seventeen but
not to have yet reached twenty. beside her was a figure in a robe of
state, as they call it, reaching to the feet, while the head was covered
with a black veil. but the instant the car was opposite the duke and
duchess and don quixote the music of the clarions ceased, and then that
of the lutes and harps on the car, and the figure in the robe rose up,
and flinging it apart and removing the veil from its face, disclosed to
their eyes the shape of death itself, fleshless and hideous, at which
sight don quixote felt uneasy, sancho frightened, and the duke and
duchess displayed a certain trepidation. having risen to its feet, this
living death, in a sleepy voice and with a tongue hardly awake, held
forth as follows:

"but i'll take you, don clown stuffed with garlic," said don quixote,
"and tie you to a tree as naked as when your mother brought you forth,
and give you, not to say three thousand three hundred, but six thousand
six hundred lashes, and so well laid on that they won't be got rid of if
you try three thousand three hundred times; don't answer me a word or
i'll tear your soul out."

inflexible or yielding reply to make its escape by his mouth or go back
again into his stomach."

don quixote on hearing this felt his throat, and turning to the duke he
said, "by god, senor, dulcinea says true, i have my soul stuck here in my
throat like the nut of a crossbow."

"what say you to this, sancho?" said the duchess.

"i say, senora," returned sancho, "what i said before; as for the lashes,
abernuncio!"

"abrenuncio, you should say, sancho, and not as you do," said the duke.

montesinos and to her former condition of peasant wench, or else in her
present form shall be carried to the elysian fields, where she will
remain waiting until the number of stripes is completed."

"now then, sancho!" said the duchess, "show courage, and gratitude for
your master don quixote's bread that you have eaten; we are all bound to
oblige and please him for his benevolent disposition and lofty chivalry.
consent to this whipping, my son; to the devil with the devil, and leave
fear to milksops, for 'a stout heart breaks bad luck,' as you very well

to this sancho replied with an irrelevant remark, which, addressing
merlin, he made to him, "will your worship tell me, senor merlin--when
that courier devil came up he gave my master a message from senor

with this they betook themselves to a garden where they were to dine, and
the duchess showed sancho's letter to the duke, who was highly delighted
with it. they dined, and after the cloth had been removed and they had
amused themselves for a while with sancho's rich conversation, the
melancholy sound of a fife and harsh discordant drum made itself heard.
all seemed somewhat put out by this dull, confused, martial harmony,
especially don quixote, who could not keep his seat from pure
disquietude; as to sancho, it is needless to say that fear drove him to
his usual refuge, the side or the skirts of the duchess; and indeed and
in truth the sound they heard was a most doleful and melancholy one.
while they were still in uncertainty they saw advancing towards them
through the garden two men clad in mourning robes so long and flowing
that they trailed upon the ground. as they marched they beat two great
drums which were likewise drap

wonderful that the mind most familiar with trouble in the world could

garden to the same notes and at the same pace as when he entered, leaving
them all amazed at his bearing and solemnity. turning to don quixote, the

the duke and duchess were extremely glad to see how readily don quixote
fell in with their scheme; but at this moment sancho observed, "i hope
this senora duenna won't be putting any difficulties in the way of the
promise of my government; for i have heard a toledo apothecary, who
talked like a goldfinch, say that where duennas were mixed up nothing
good could happen. god bless me, how he hated them, that same apothecary!
and so what i'm thinking is, if all duennas, of whatever sort or

my country skirts or tails, tails or skirts, it's all one."

"hush, friend sancho," said don quixote; "since this lady duenna comes in
quest of me from such a distant land she cannot be one of those the
apothecary meant; moreover this is a countess, and when countesses serve
as duennas it is in the service of queens and empresses, for in their own
houses they are mistresses paramount and have other duennas to wait on
them."

 the fife and drums once more, from which they concluded that
the distressed duenna was making her entrance. the duchess asked the duke
if it would be proper to go out to receive her, as she was a countess and
a person of rank.

"in respect of her being a countess," said sancho, before the duke could
reply, "i am for your highnesses going out to receive her; but in respect
of her being a duenna, it is my opinion you should not stir a step."

"who bade thee meddle in this, sancho?" said don quixote.

"who, senor?" said sancho; "i meddle for i have a right to meddle, as a
squire who has learned the rules of courtesy in the school of your
worship, the most courteous and best-bred knight in the whole world of
courtliness; and in these things, as i have heard your worship say, as
much is lost by a card too many as by a card too few, and to one who has

"sancho is right," said the duke; "we'll see what the countess is like,

on at procession pace, their faces
being covered with black veils, not transparent ones like trifaldin's,
but so close that they allowed nothing to be seen through them. as soon
as the band of duennas was fully in sight, the duke, the duchess, and don
quixote stood up, as well as all who were watching the slow-moving
procession. the twelve duennas halted and formed a lane, along which the
distressed one advanced, trifaldin still holding her hand. on seeing this
the duke, the duchess, and don quixote went some twelve paces forward to
meet her. she then, kneeling on the ground, said in a voice hoarse and
rough, rather than fine and delicate, "may it please your highnesses not
to offer such courtesies to this your servant, i should say to this your
handmaid, for i am in such distress that i shall never be able to make a
proper return, because my strange and unparalleled misfortune has carried
off my wits, and i know not whither; but it must be a long way off, for
the more i look for th

em the less i find them."

"he would be wanting in wits, senora countess," said the duke, "who did
not perceive your worth by your person, for at a glance it may be seen it
deserves all the cream of courtesy and flower of polite usage;" and
raising her up by the hand he led her to a seat beside the duchess, who
likewise received her with great urbanity. don quixote remained silent,
while sancho was dying to see the features of trifaldi and one or two of
her many duennas; but there was no possibility of it until they
themselves displayed them of their own accord and free will.

all kept still, waiting to see who would break silence, which the
distressed duenna did in these words: "i am confident, most mighty lord,
most fair lady, and most discreet company, that my most miserable misery
will be accorded a reception no less dispassionate than generou

condolent in your most valiant bosoms, for it is one that is enough to
melt marble, soften diamonds, and mollify the steel of the most hardened
hearts in the world; but ere it is proclaimed to your hearing, not to say
your ears, i would fain be enlightened whether there be present in this
society, circle, or company, that knight immaculatissimus, don quixote de
la manchissima, and his squirissimus panza."

"the panza is here," said sancho, before anyone could reply, "and don
quixotissimus too; and so, most distressedest duenissima, you may say
what you willissimus, for we are all readissimus to do you any
servissimus."

on this don quixote rose, and addressing the distressed duenna, said, "if
your sorrows, afflicted lady, can indulge in any hope of relief from the
valour or might of any knight-errant, here are mine, which, feeble and

make any appeal to benevolence, or deal in preambles, only to tell your
woes plainly and straightforwardly: for you have hearers that will know
how, if not to remedy them, to sympathise with them."

on hearing this, the distressed duenna made as though she would throw
herself at don quixote's feet, and actually did fall before them and
said, as she strove t

o embrace them, "before these feet and legs i cast
myself, o unconquered knight, as before, what they are, the foundations
and pillars of knight-errantry; these feet i desire to kiss, for upon
their steps hangs and depends the sole remedy for my misfortune, o
valorous errant, whose veritable achievements leave behind and eclipse
the fabulous ones of the amadises, esplandians, and belianises!" then
turning from don quixote to sancho panza, and grasping his hands, she
said, "o thou, most loyal squire that ever served knight-errant in this
present age or ages past, whose goodness is more extensive than the beard
of trifaldin my companion here of present, well mayest thou boast thyself
that, in serving the great don quixote, thou art serving, summed up in
one, the whole host of knights that have ever borne arms in the world. i
conjure thee, by what thou owest to thy most loyal goodness, that thou
wilt become

a very worthy alguacil of the court."

"are there alguacils of the court in kandy, too," said sancho at this,
"and poets, and seguidillas? i swear i think the world is the same all
over! but make haste, senora trifaldi; for it is late, and i am dying to
know the end of this long story."

"i will," replied the countess.




chapter xxxix.

in which the trifaldi continues her marvellous and memorable story


by every word that sancho uttered, the duchess was as much delighted as
don quixote was driven to desperation. he bade him hold his tongue, and
the distressed one went on to say: "at length, after much questioning and
answering, as the princess held to her story, without changing or varying
her previous declaration, the vicar gave his decision in favour of don
clavijo, and she was delivered over to him as his lawful wife; which the
queen dona maguncia, the princess antonomasia's mother, so took to heart,
that within the space of three days we buried her."

"she died, n

have heard say, then the mischief would have been past curing. but to
marry such an elegant accomplished gentleman as has been just now
described to us--indeed, indeed, though it was a folly, it was not such a
great one as you think; for according to the rules of my master here--and
he won't allow me to lie--as of men of letters bishops are made, so of
gentlemen knights, specially if they be errant, kings and emperors may be
made."

"thou art right, sancho," said don quixote, "for with a knight-errant, if
he has but two fingers' breadth of good fortune, it is on the cards to
become the mightiest lord on earth. but let senora the distressed one
proceed; for i suspect she has got yet to tell us the bitter part of this
so far sweet story."

"the bitter is indeed to come," said the countess; "and such bitter that
colocynth is sweet and oleander toothsome in comparison. the queen, then,
being dead, and not in a swoon, we buried her; and hardly had we covered

ceased speaking we all felt the pores of our faces opening, and pricking
us, as if with the points of needles. we at once put our hands up to our
faces and found ourselves in the state you now see."

here the distressed one and the other duennas raised the veils with which
they were covered, and disclosed countenances all bristling with beards,
some red, some black, some white, and some grizzled, at which spectacle
the duke and duchess made a show of being filled with wonder. don quixote
and sancho were overwhelmed with amazement, and the bystanders lost in
astonishment, while the trifaldi went on to say: "thus did that
malevolent villain malambruno punish us, covering the tenderness and
softness of our faces with these rough bristles! would to heaven that he
had swept off our heads with his enormous scimitar instead of obscuring
the light of our countenances with these wool-combings that cover us! for

the history goes on to say that when sancho saw the distressed one faint
he exclaimed: "i swear by the faith of an honest man and the shades of
all my ancestors the panzas, that never i did see or hear of, nor has my
master related or conceived in his mind, such an adventure as this. a

our faces and plucking them off with a jerk we are left as bare and
smooth as the bottom of a stone mortar. there are, to be sure, women in
kandy that go about from house to house to remove down, and trim
eyebrows, and make cosmetics for the use of the women, but we, the
duennas of my lady, would never let them in, for most of them have a
flavour of agents that have ceased to be principals; and if we are not
relieved by senor don quixote we shall be carried to our graves with
beards."

"i will pluck out my own in the land of the moors," said don quixote, "if
i don't cure yours."

at this instant the trifaldi recovered from her swoon and said, "the
chink of that promise, valiant knight, reached my ears in the midst of my
swoon, and has been the means of reviving me and bringing back my senses;
and so once more i implore you, illustrious errant, indomitable sir, to
let your gracious promises be turned into deeds."

"the fact is," replied the distressed one, "it is five thousand leagues,
a couple more or less, from this to the kingdom of kandy, if you go by
land; but if you go through the air and in a straight line, it is three

of the arrival of clavileno and the end of this protracted adventure


and now night came, and with it the appointed time for the arrival of the
famous horse clavileno, the non-appearance of which was already beginning
to make don quixote uneasy, for it struck him that, as malambruno was so
long about sending it, either he himself was not the knight for whom the
adventure was reserved, or else malambruno did not dare to meet him in
single combat. but lo! suddenly there came into the garden four wild-men
all clad in green ivy bearing on their shoulders a great wooden horse.
they placed it on its feet on the ground, and one of the wild-men said,
"let the knight who has heart for it mount this machine."

here sancho exclaim

is but to turn this peg the horse has in his neck, and he will bear them
through the air to where malambruno awaits them; but lest the vast
elevation of their course should make them giddy, their eyes must be
covered until the horse neighs, which will be the sign of their having
completed their journey."

with these words, leaving clavileno behind them, they retired with easy
dignity the way they came. as soon as the distressed one saw the horse,
almost in tears she exclaimed to don quixote, "valiant knight, the
promise of malambruno has proved trustworthy; the horse has come, our
beards are growing, and by every hair in them all of us implore thee to
shave and shear us, as it is only mounting him with thy squire and making
a happy beginning with your new journey."

"that i will, senora countess trifaldi," said don quixote, "most gladly
and with right goodwill, without stopping to take a cushion or put on my
spurs, so as not to lose time, such is my desire to see you and a

r."

"friend sancho," said the duke at this, "the island that i have promised
you is not a moving one, or one that will run away; it has roots so
deeply buried in the bowels of the earth that it will be no easy matter
to pluck it up or shift it from where it is; you know as well as i do
that there is no sort of office of any importance that is not obtained by
a bribe of some kind, great or small; well then, that which i look to
receive for this government is that you go with your master don quixote,
and bring this memorable adventure to a conclusion; and whether you
return on clavileno as quickly as his speed seems to promise, or adverse
fortune brings you back on foot travelling as a pilgrim from hostel to
hostel and from inn to inn, you will always find your island on your
return where you left it, and your islanders with the same eagerness they
have always had to receive you as their governor, and my good-will will
remain the same; doubt not the truth of this, senor sancho, for

or call upon the angels to protect me when we go towering up there."

to this the trifaldi made answer, "sancho, you may freely commend
yourself to god or whom you will; for malambruno though an enchanter is a
christian, and works his enchantments with great circumspection, taking
very good care not to fall out with anyone."

"well then," said sancho, "god and the most holy trinity of gaeta give me
help!"

"since the memorable adventure of the fulling mills," said don quixote,
"i have never seen sancho in such a fright as now; were i as
superstitious as others his abject fear would cause me some little
trepidation of spirit. but come here, sancho, for with the leave of these
gentles i would say a word or two to thee in private;" and drawing sancho
aside among the trees of the garden and seizing both his hands he said,
"thou seest, brother sancho, the long journey we have before us, and god
knows when we shall return, or what leisure or opportunities this
bus

ust be out of your senses! this
is like the common saying, 'you see me with child, and you want me a
virgin.' just as i'm about to go sitting on a bare board, your worship
would have me score my backside! indeed, your worship is not reasonable.
let us be off to shave these duennas; and on our return i promise on my
word to make such haste to wipe off all that's due as will satisfy your
worship; i can't say more."

"well, i will comfort myself with that promise, my good sancho," replied
don quixote, "and i believe thou wilt keep it; for indeed though stupid
thou art veracious."

"i'm not voracious," said sancho, "only peckish; but even if i was a
little, still i'd keep my word."

with this they went back to mount clavileno, and as they were about to do
so don quixote said, "cover thine eyes, sancho, and mount; for one who
sends for us from lands so far distant cannot mean to deceive us for the
sake of the paltry glory to be derived from deceiving persons who trust
in him; though

 all should turn out the contrary of what i hope, no malice
will be able to dim the glory of having undertaken this exploit."

"let us be off, senor," said sancho, "for i have taken the beards and
tears of these ladies deeply to heart, and i shan't eat a bit to relish
it until i have seen them restored to their former smoothness. mount,
your worship, and blindfold yourself, for if i am to go on the croup, it
is plain the rider in the saddle must mount first."

"that is true," said don quixote, and, taking a handkerchief out of his
pocket, he begged the distressed one to bandage his eyes very carefully;
but after having them bandaged he uncovered them again, saying, "if my
memory does not deceive me, i have read in virgil of the palladium of
troy, a wooden horse the greeks offered to the goddess pallas, which was
big with armed knights, who were afterwards the destruction of troy; so
it would be as well to see, first of all, what clavileno has in his
stomach."

"there is no

occasion," said the distressed one; "i will be bail for him,
and i know that malambruno has nothing tricky or treacherous about him;
you may mount without any fear, senor don quixote; on my head be it if
any harm befalls you."

don quixote thought that to say anything further with regard to his
safety would be putting his courage in an unfavourable light; and so,
without more words, he mounted clavileno, and tried the peg, which turned
easily; and as he had no stirrups and his legs hung down, he looked like
nothing so much as a figure in some roman triumph painted or embroidered
on a flemish tapestry.

much against the grain, and very slowly, sancho proceeded to mount, and,
after settling himself as well as he could on th

plan would be to sit sideways like a woman,
as in that way he would not feel the hardness so much.

sancho did so, and, bidding them farewell, allowed his eyes to be
bandaged, but immediately afterwards uncovered them again, and looking
tenderly and tearfully on those in the garden, bade them help him in his
present strait with plenty of paternosters and ave marias, that god might
provide some one to say as many for them, whenever they found themselves
in a similar emergency.

at this don quixote exclaimed, "art thou on the gallows, thief, or at thy
last moment, to use pitiful entreaties of that sort? cowardly, spiritless
creature, art thou not in the very place the fair magalona occupied, and
from which she descended, not into the grave, but to become queen of
france; unless the histories lie? and i who am here beside thee, may i
not put myself on a par with the valiant pierres, who pressed this very
spot that i now press? cover thine eyes, cover thine eyes, abject animal,

et not thy fear escape thy lips, at least in my presence."

"blindfold me," said sancho; "as you won't let me commend myself or be
commended to god, is it any wonder if i am afraid there is a region of
devils about here that will carry us off to peralvillo?"

they were then blindfolded, and don quixote, finding himself settled to
his satisfaction, felt for the peg, and the instant he placed his fingers
on it, all the duennas and all who stood by lifted up their voices
exclaiming, "god guide thee, valiant knight! god be with thee, intrepid
squire! now, now ye go cleaving the air more swiftly than an arrow! now
ye begin to amaze and astonish all who are gazing at you from the earth!
take care not to wobble about, valiant sancho! mind thou fall not, for

sh youth's who tried to steer the
chariot of his father the sun!"

as sancho heard the voices, clinging tightly to his master and winding
his arms round him, he said, "senor, how do they make out we are going up
so high, if their voices reach us here and they seem to be speaking quite
close to us?"

"don't mind that, sancho," said don quixote; "for as affairs of this
sort, and flights like this are out of the common course of things, you
can see and hear as much as you like a thousand leagues off; but don't
squeeze me so tight or thou wilt upset me; and really i know not what
thou hast to be uneasy or frightened at, for i can safely swear i never

we never stirred from one place. banish fear, my friend, for indeed

ve the wind astern."

"that's true," said sancho, "for such a strong wind comes against me on
this side, that it seems as if people were blowing on me with a thousand
pair of bellows;" which was the case; they were puffing at him with a
great pair of bellows; for the whole adventure was so well planned by the
duke, the duchess, and their majordomo, that nothing was omitted to make
it perfectly successful.

don quixote now, feeling the blast, said, "beyond a doubt, sancho, we
must have already reached the second region of the air, where the hail
and snow are generated; the thunder, the lightning, and the thunderbolts
are engendered in the third region, and if we go on ascending at this
rate, we shall shortly plunge into the region of fire, and i know not how
to regulate this peg, so as not to mount up where we shall be burned."

and now they began to warm their faces, from a distance, with tow that

uld be easily set on fire and extinguished again, fixed on the end of a
cane. on feeling the heat sancho said, "may i die if we are not already
in that fire place, or very near it, for a good part of my beard has been
singed, and i have a mind, senor, to uncover and see whereabouts we are."

"do nothing of the kind," said don quixote; "remember the true story of
the licentiate torralva that the devils carried flying through the air
riding on a stick with his eyes shut; who in twelve hours reached rome
and dismounted at torre di nona, which is a street of the city, and saw
the whole sack and storming and the death of bourbon, and was back in
madrid the next morning, where he gave an account of all he had seen; and
he said moreover that as he was going through the air, the devil bade him
open his eyes, and he did so, a

not have been very tender of flesh."

the duke, the duchess, and all in the garden were listening to the
conversation of the two heroes, and were beyond measure amused by it; and
now, desirous of putting a finishing touch to this rare and
well-contrived adventure, they applied a light to clavileno's tail with
some tow, and the horse, being full of squibs and crackers, immediately
blew up with a prodigious noise, and brought don quixote and sancho panza
to the ground half singed. by this time the bearded band of duennas, the
trifaldi and all, had vanished from the garden, and those that remained
lay stretched on the ground as if in a swoon. don quixote and sancho got
up rather shaken, and, looking about them, were filled with amazement at
finding themselves in the same garden from which they had started, and
seeing such a number of people stretched on the ground; and their
astonishment was increased when at one side of 
 
 ___________________________
 
the garden they perceived
a tall lance planted in the ground, and hanging from it by two cords of
green silk a smooth white parchment on which there was the following
inscription in large gold letters: "the illustrious knight don quixote of
la mancha has, by merely attempting it, finished and concluded the
adventure of the countess trifaldi, otherwise called the distressed
duenna; malambruno is now satisfied on every point, the chins of the
duennas are now smooth and clean, and king don clavijo and queen
antonomasia in their original form; and when the squirely flagellation
shall have been completed, the white dove shall find herself delivered
from the pestiferous gerfalcons that persecute her, and in the arms of
her be

loved mate; for such is the decree of the sage merlin,
arch-enchanter of enchanters."

as soon as don quixote had read the inscription on the parchment he
perceived clearly that it referred to the disenchantment of dulcinea, and
returning hearty thanks to heaven that he had with so little danger
achieved so grand an exploit as to restore to their former complexion the
countenances of those venerable duennas, he advanced towards the duke and
duchess, who had not yet come to themselves, and taking the duke by the
hand he said, "be of good cheer, worthy sir, be of good cheer; it's
nothing at all; t

nd without any harm done, as
the inscription fixed on this post shows plainly."

the duke came to himself slowly and like one recovering consciousness
after a heavy sleep, and the duchess and all who had fallen prostrate
about the garden did the same, with such demonstrations of wonder and
amazement that they would have almost persuaded one that what they
pretended so adroitly in jest had happened to them in reality. the duke
read the placard with half-shut eyes, and then ran to embrace don quixote
with open arms, declaring him to be the best knight that had ever been
seen in any age. sancho kept looking about for the distressed one, to see
what her face was like without the beard, and if she was as fair as her
elegant person promised; but they told him that, the instant clavileno
descended flaming through the air and came to the ground, the whole band
of duennas with the trifaldi vanished, and that they were already shaved
and without a stump left.

the duchess asked sancho how

amused myself with the goats--which are like violets, like flowers--for
nigh three-quarters of an hour; and clavileno never stirred or moved from
one spot."

"and while the good sancho was amusing himself with the goats," said the
duke, "how did senor don quixote amuse himself?"

to which don quixote replied, "as all these things and such like
occurrences are out of the ordinary course of nature, it is no wonder
that sancho says what he does; for my own part i can only say that i did
not uncover my eyes either above or below, nor did i see sky or earth or

they did not care to ask him anything more about his journey, for they
saw he was in the vein to go rambling all over the heavens giving an
account of everything that went on there, without having ever stirred
from the garden. such, in short, was the end of the adventure of the
distressed duenna, which gave the duke and duchess laughing matter not
only for the time being, but for all their lives, and sancho something to
talk about for ages, if he lived so long; but don quixote, coming close
to his ear, said to him, "sancho, as you would have us believe what you
saw in heaven, i require you to believe me as to what i saw in the cave
of montesinos; i say no more."

of the counsels which don quixote gave sancho panza before he set out to
govern the island, together with other well-considered matters


the duke and duchess were so well pleased with the successful and droll
result of the adventure of the distressed one, that they resolved

"of letters i know but little," said sancho, "for i don't even know the a
b c; but it is enough for me to have the christus in my memory to be a
good governor. as for arms, i'll handle those they give me till i drop,
and then, god be my help!"

"with so good a memory," said the duke, "sancho cannot go wrong in
anything."

here don quixote joined them; and learning what passed, and how soon
sancho was to go to his government, he with the duke's permission took
him by the hand, and retired to his room with him for the purpose of
giving him advice as to how he was to demean himself in his office. as
soon as they had entered the chamber he closed the door after him, and
almost by force made sancho sit down beside him, and in a quiet tone thus
addressed him: "i give infinite thanks to heaven, friend sancho, that,

"that's the truth," said sancho; "but that was when i was a boy;
afterwards when i was something more of a man it was geese i kept, not
pigs. but to my thinking that has nothing to do with it; for all who are
governors don't come of a kingly stock."

"true," said don quixote, "and for that reason those who are not of noble
origin should take care that the dignity of the office they hold be
accompanied by a gentle suavity, which wisely managed will save them from
the sneers of malice that no station escapes.

"glory in thy humble birth, sancho, and be not ashamed of saying thou art

of the second set of counsels don quixote gave sancho panza


who, hearing the foregoing discourse of don quixote, would not have set
him down for a person of great good sense and greater rectitude of
purpose? but, as has been frequently observed in the course of this great
history, he only talked nonsense when he touched on chivalry, and in
discussing all other subjects showed that he had a clear and unbiassed
understanding; so that at every turn his acts gave the lie to his
intellect, and his intellect to his acts; but in th

e case of these second
counsels that he gave sancho, he showed himself to have a lively turn of
humour, and displayed conspicuously his wisdom, and also his folly.

sancho listened to him with the deepest attention, and endeavoured to fix
his counsels in his memory, like one who meant to follow them and by
their means bring the full promise of his government to a happy issue.
don quixote, then, went on to say:

"with regard to the mode in which thou shouldst govern thy person and thy
house, sancho, the first charge i have to give thee is to be clean, and
to cut thy nails, not letting them grow as some do, whose ignorance makes
them fancy that long nails are an ornament to their hands, as if those
excrescences they neglect to cut were nails, and not the talons of a
lizard-catching kestrel--a filthy and unnatural abuse.

"go not ungirt and loose, sancho; for disordered a

"dine sparingly and sup more sparingly still; for the health of the whole
body is forged in the workshop of the stomach.

"be temperate in drinking, bearing in mind that wine in excess keeps
neither secrets nor promises.

"take care, sancho, not to chew on both sides, and not to eruct in
anybody's presence."

"eruct!" said sancho; "i don't know what that means."

"to eruct, sancho," said don quixote, "means to belch, and that is one of
the filthiest words in the spanish language, though a very expressive
one; and therefore nice folk have had recourse to the latin, and instead
of belch say eruct, and instead of belches say eructations; and if some
do not understand these terms it matters little, for custom will bring
them into use in the course of time, so that they will be readily
understood; this is the way a language is enriched; custom and the public
are all-powerful there."

"

in truth, senor," said sancho, "one of the counsels and cautions i mean
to bear in mind shall be this, not to belch, for i'm constantly doing
it."

"eruct, sancho, not belch," said don quixote.

"eruct, i shall say henceforth, and i swear not to forget it," said
sancho.

"likewise, sancho," said don quixote, "thou must not mingle such a
quantity of proverbs in thy discourse as thou dost; for though proverbs
are short maxims, thou dost drag them in so often by the head and
shoulders that they savour more of nonsense than of maxims."

"god alone can cure that," said sancho; "for i have more proverbs in me
than a book, and when i speak they come so thick together into my mouth
that they fall to fighting among themselves to get out; that's why my
tongue lets fly the first that come, though the

of my office; for 'in a house where there's plenty, supper is soon
cooked,' and 'he who binds does not wrangle,' and 'the bell-ringer's in a
safe berth,' and 'giving and keeping require brains.'"

"that's it, sancho!" said don quixote; "pack, tack, string proverbs
together; nobody is hindering thee! 'my mother beats me, and i go on with
my tricks.' i am bidding thee avoid proverbs, and here in a second thou
hast shot out a whole litany of them, which have as much to do with what
we are talking about as 'over the hills of ubeda.' mind, sancho, i do not
say that a proverb aptly brought in is objectionable; but to pile up and
string together proverbs at random makes conversation dull and vulgar.

be given me in writing; for though i can't either read or write, i'll
give it to my confessor, to drive it into me and remind me of it whenever
it is necessary."

"ah, sinner that i am!" said don quixote, "how bad it looks in governors
not to know how to read or write; for let me tell thee, sancho, when a
man knows not how to read, or is left-handed, it argues one of two
things; either that he was the son of exceedingly mean and lowly parents,
or that he himself was so incorrigible and ill-conditioned that neither
good company nor good teaching could make any impression on him. it is a
great defect that thou labourest under, and therefore i would have thee

silly sayings of the rich pass for saws in the world;' and as i'll be
rich, being a governor, and at the same time generous, as i mean to be,
no fault will be seen in me. 'only make yourself honey and the flies will
suck you;' 'as much as thou hast so much art thou worth,' as my
grandmother used to say; and 'thou canst have no revenge of a man of
substance.'"

"oh, god's curse upon thee, sancho!" here exclaimed don quixote; "sixty
thousand devils fly away with thee and thy proverbs! for the last hour
thou hast been stringing them together and inflicting the pangs of
torture on me with every one of them. those proverbs will bring thee to
the gallows one day, i promise thee; thy subjects will take the
government from thee, or there will be revolts among them. tell me, where
dost thou pick them up, thou booby? how dost thou apply them, thou
blockhead? for with me, to utter one and make it apply properly, i ha

"by god, master mine," said sancho, "your worship is making a fuss about
very little. why the devil should you be vexed if i make use of what is
my own? and i have got nothing else, nor any other stock in trade except
proverbs and more proverbs; and here are three just this instant come
into my head, pat to the purpose and like pears in a basket; but i won't
repeat them, for 'sage silence is called sancho.'"

"that, sancho, thou art not," said don quixote; "for not only art thou
not sage silence, but thou art pestilent prate and perversity; still i
would like to know what three proverbs have just now come into thy
memory, for i have been turning over mine own--and it is a good one--and
none occurs to me."

"what can be better," said sancho, "than 'never put thy thumbs between
two back teeth;' and 'to "get out of my house" and "what do you want with
my wife?" there is no answer;' and 'whether the pitcher hits the stove,
or the stove the

mote in another's eye had need to see the beam in his own,' that it be
not said of himself, 'the dead woman was frightened at the one with her

own house than the wise man in another's.'"

"nay, sancho," said don quixote, "the fool knows nothing, either in his
own house or in anybody else's, for no wise structure of any sort can
stand on a foundation of folly; but let us say no more about it, sancho,
for if thou governest badly, thine will be the fault and mine the shame;
but i comfort myself with having done my duty in advising thee as
earnestly and as wisely as i could; and thus i am released from my
obligations and my promise. god guide thee, sancho, and govern thee in

i know no more about the government of islands than a buzzard; and if
there's any reason to think that because of my being a governor the devil
will get hold of me, i'd rather go sancho to heaven than governor to
hell."

"by god, sancho," said don quixote, "for those last words thou hast
uttered alone, i consider thou deservest to be governor of a thousand
islands. thou hast good natural instincts, without which no knowledge is
worth anything; commend thyself to god, and try not to swerve in the
pursuit of thy main object; i mean, always make it thy aim and fixed
purpose to do right in all matters that come before thee, for heaven
always helps good intentions; and now let us go to dinner, for i think my
lord and lady are waiting for us."

chapter xliv.

how sancho panza was conducted to his government, and of the strange
adventure that befell don quixote in the castle


it is stated, they say, in the true original of this history, that when
cide hamete came to write this chapter, his interpreter did not translate
it as he wrote it--that is, as a kind of complaint the moor made against
himself for having taken in hand a story so dry and of so little variety
as this of don quixote, for he found himself forced to speak perpetually
of him and sancho, without venturing to indulge in digressions and
episodes more serious and more interesting. he said, too, that to go on,
mind, hand, pen always restricted to writing upon one single subject, and
speaking through the mouths of a few characters, was intolerable
drudgery, the result of which was never equal to the author's labour, and
that to avoid this he had in the first part availed himself of the device
of novels, like

 "the ill-advised curiosity," and "the captive captain,"
which stand, as it were, apart from the story; the others are given there
being incidents which occurred to don quixote himself and could not be
omitted. he also thought, he says, that many, engrossed by the interest
attaching to the exploits of don quixote, would take none in the novels,
and pass them over hastily or impatiently without noticing the elegance
and art of their composition, which would be very manifest were they
published by themselves and not as mere adjuncts to the crazes of don
quixote or the simplicities of sancho. therefore in this second part he
thought it best not to insert novels, either separate or interwoven, but
only episodes, something like them, arising out of the circumstances the
facts present; and even these s

paringly, and with no more words than
suffice to make them plain; and as he confines and restricts himself to
the narrow limits of the narrative, though he has ability; capacity, and
brains enough to deal with the whole universe, he requests that his
labours may not be despised, and that credit be given him, not alone for
what he writes, but for what he has refrained from writing.

and so he goes on with his story, saying that the day don quixote gave
the counsels to sancho, the same afternoon after dinner he handed them to
him in writing so that he might get some one to read them to him. they
had scarcely, however, been given to him when he let them drop, and they
fell into the hands of the duke, who showed them to the duchess and they
were both amazed afresh at the madness and wit of don quixote. to carry
on the joke, then, the same evening they despatched sancho with a large
following to the village that was to serve him for a

instructed by his master and mistress as to how to deal with sancho, he
carried out their scheme admirably. now it came to pass that as soon as
sancho saw this majordomo he seemed in his features to recognise those of
the trifaldi, and turning to his master, he said to him, "senor, either
the devil will carry me off, here on this spot, righteous and believing,
or your worship will own to me that the face of this majordomo of the
duke's here is the very face of the distressed one."

don quixote regarded the majordomo attentively, and having done so, said
to sancho, "there is no reason why the devil should carry thee off,
sancho, either righteous or believing--and what thou meanest by that i
know not; the face of the distressed one is that of the majordomo, but
for all that the majordomo is not the distressed one; for his being so
would involve a mighty contradiction; but this is not the time for going
into questions of the sort, which would be involving ourselves in an

able labyrinth. believe me, my friend, we must pray earnestly to
our lord that he deliver us both from wicked wizards and enchanters."

"it is no joke, senor," said sancho, "for before this i heard him speak,
and it seemed exactly as if the voice of the trifaldi was sounding in my
ears. well, i'll hold my peace; but i'll take care to be on the look-out
henceforth for any sign that may be seen to confirm or do away with this
suspicion."

"thou wilt do well, sancho," said don quixote, "and thou wilt let me know
all thou discoverest, and all that befalls thee in thy government."

sancho at last set out attended by a great number of people. he was
dressed in the garb of a lawyer, with a gaban of tawny watered camlet
over all and a montera cap of the same material, and mounted a la gineta
upon a mule. behind him, in accordance with the duke's orders, followed
dapple with brand new ass-trappings and ornaments of silk, and from time
to time sancho turned round to look at

 his ass, so well pleased to have
him with him that he would not have changed places with the emperor of
germany. on taking leave he kissed the hands of the duke and duchess and
got his master's blessing, which don quixote gave him with tears, and he
received blubbering.

let worthy sancho go in peace, and good luck to him, gentle reader; and
look out for two bushels of laughter, which the account of how he behaved
himself in office will give thee. in the meantime turn thy attention to
what happened his master the same night, and if thou dost not laugh
thereat, at any rate thou wilt stretch thy mouth with a grin; for don
quixote's adventures must be honoured either with wonder or with
laughter.

recorded, then, that as soon as sancho had gone, don quixote felt
his loneliness, and had it been possible for him to revoke the mandate
and take away the government from him he would have done so. the duchess
observed his dejection and asked him why he was melancholy; because, she
said, if it was for the loss of sancho, there were squires, duennas, and
damsels in her house who would wait upon him to his full satisfaction.

"the truth is, senora," replied don quixote, "that i do feel the loss of
sancho; but that is not the main cause of my looking sad; and of all the
offers your excellence makes me, i accept only the good-will with which
they are made, and as to the remainder i entreat of your excellence to
permit and allow me alone to wait upon myself in my chamber."

"indeed, senor don quixote," said the duchess, "that must not be; four of
my damsels, as beautiful as flowers, shall wait upon you."

"to me," said don quixote, "they will not be flo

though i deserve it not, permit me to please myself, and wait upon myself
in my own room; for i place a barrier between my inclinations and my
virtue, and i do not wish to break this rule through the generosity your
highness is disposed to display towards me; and, in short, i will sleep
in my clothes, sooner than allow anyone to undress me."

"say no more, senor don quixote, say no more," said the duchess; "i
assure you i will give orders that not even a fly, not to say a damsel,
shall enter your room. i am not the one to undermine the propriety of
senor don quixote, for it strikes me that among his many virtues the one
that is pre-eminent is that of modesty. your worship may undress and
dress in private and in your own way, as you please and when you please,
for there will be no one to hinder you; and in your chamber you will find

the great dulcinea del toboso live a thousand years, and may her fame
extend all over the surface of the globe, for she deserves to be loved by
a knight so valiant and so virtuous; and may kind heaven infuse zeal into
the heart of our governor sancho panza to finish off his discipline
speedily, so that the world may once more enjoy the beauty of so grand a
lady."

to which don quixote replied, "your highness has spoken like what you
are; from the mouth of a noble lady nothing bad can come; and dulcinea
will be more fortunate, and better known to the world by the praise of
your highness than by all the eulogies the greatest orators on earth
could bestow upon her."

"well, well, senor don quixote," said the duchess, it is nearly supper-time,
and the duke is probably waiting; come let us go to supper, and retire
to rest early, for the journey you made yesterday from kan

a short one but that it must have caused you some fatigue."

"i feel none, senora," said don quixote, "for i would go so far as to
swear to your excellence that in all my life i never mounted a quieter
beast, or a pleasanter paced one, than clavileno; and i don't know what
could have induced malambruno to discard a steed so swift and so gentle,
and burn it so recklessly as he did."

"probably," said the duchess, "repenting of the evil he had done to the
trifaldi and company, and others, and the crimes he must have committed
as a wizard and enchanter, he resolved to make away with all t

instruments of his craft; and so burned clavileno as the chief one, and
that which mainly kept him restless, wandering from land to land; and by
its ashes and the trophy of the placard the valour of the great don
quixote of la mancha is established for ever."

don quixote renewed his thanks to the duchess; and having supped, retired
to his chamber alone, refusing to allow anyone to enter with him to wait
on him, such was his fear of encountering temptations that might lead or
drive him to forget his chaste fidelity to his lady dulcinea; for he had
always present to his mind the virtue of amadis, that flower and mirror
of knights-errant. he locked the door behind him, and by the light of two
wax candles undressed himself, but as he was taking off his stocki

always cockering up his honour, dining miserably and in secret, and
making a hypocrite of the toothpick with which he sallies out into the
street after eating nothing to oblige him to use it! poor fellow, i say,
with his nervous honour, fancying they perceive a league off the patch on
his shoe, the sweat-stains on his hat, the shabbiness of his cloak, and
the hunger of his stomach!"

all this was brought home to don quixote by the bursting of his stitches;
however, he comforted himself on perceiving that sancho had left behind a
pair of travelling boots, which he resolved to wear the next day. at last
he went to bed, out of spirits and heavy at heart, as much because he
missed sancho as because of the irreparable disaster to his stockings,
the stitches of which he would have even taken up with silk of another
colour, which is one of the greatest signs of poverty a gentleman can
show in the course of his nev

thought a light and wanton maiden by those who know not the mighty power
of love; but come what may; better a blush on the cheeks than a sore in
the heart;" and here a harp softly touched made itself heard. as he
listened to all this don quixote was in a state of breathless amazement,
for immediately the countless adventures like this, with windows,
gratings, gardens, serenades, lovemakings, and languishings, that he had
read of in his trashy books of chivalry, came to his mind. he at once
concluded that some damsel of the duchess's was in love with him, and
that her modesty forced her to keep her passion secret. he trembled lest
he should fall, and made an inward resolution not to yield; and
commending himself with all his migh

made up his mind to listen to the music; and to let them know he was
there he gave a pretended sneeze, at which the damsels were not a little
delighted, for all they wanted was that don quixote should hear them. so
having tuned the harp, altisidora, running her hand across the strings,
began this ballad:

o thou that art above in bed,
  between the holland sheets,
a-lying there from night till morn,
  with outstretched legs asleep;

o thou, most valiant knight of all
  the famed manchegan breed,
of purity and virtue more
  than gold of araby;

for those two suns of thine have lit

and i am moulded in a form

  spoils to thy spear and bow all;
a damsel of this house am i,
  by name altisidora.

here the lay of the heart-stricken altisidora came to an end, while the
warmly wooed don quixote began to feel alarm; and with a deep sigh he
said to himself, "o that i should be such an unlucky knight that no
damsel can set eyes on me but falls in love with me! o that the peerless
dulcinea should be so unfortunate that they cannot let her enjoy my
incomparable constancy in peace! what would ye with her, ye queens? why
do ye persecute her, ye empresses? why ye pursue her, ye virgins of from

his good trenchant sword, took up a large rosary that he always carried
with him, and with great solemnity and precision of gait proceeded to the
antechamber where the duke and duchess were already dressed and waiting
for him. but as he passed through a gallery, altisidora and the other
damsel, her friend, were lying in wait for him, and the instant
altisidora saw him she pretended to faint, while her friend caught her in
her lap, and began hastily unlacing the bosom of her dress.

don quixote observed it, and approaching them said, "i know very well
what this seizure arises from."

"i know not from what," replied the friend, "for altisidora is the
healthiest damsel in all this house, and i have never heard her complain
all the time i have known her. a plague on all the knights-errant in the
world, if they be all ungrateful! go away, senor don quixote; for this
poor child will not come to herself again so long as you are here."

to which don quixote returned, "do me the favo

to be remarked by any who might see him there.

he had scarcely withdrawn when altisidora, recovering from her swoon,
said to her companion, "the lute must be left, for no doubt don quixote
intends to give us some music; and being his it will not be bad."

they went at once to inform the duchess of what was going on, and of the
lute don quixote asked for, and she, delighted beyond measure, plotted
with the duke and her two damsels to play him a trick that should be
amusing but harmless; and in high glee they waited for night, which came
quickly as the day had come; and as for the day, the duke and duchess
spent it in charming conversation with don quixote.

tried it, opened the window, and perceived that some persons were walking
in the garden; and having passed his fingers over the frets of the guitar
and tuned it as well as he could, he spat and cleared his chest, and then
with a voice a little hoarse but full-toned, he sang the following
ballad, which he had himself that day composed:

don quixote had got so far with his song, to which the duke, the duchess,
altisidora, and nearly the whole household of the castle were listening,
when all of a sudden from a gallery above that was exactly over his
window they let down a cord with more than a hundred bells attached to
it, and immediately after that discharged a great sack full of cats,
which also had bells of smaller size tied to their tails. such was the
din of the bells and the squalling of the cats, that though the duke and

and flying from one side to the other, made it seem as if there was a
legion of devils at large in it. they extinguished the candles that were
burning in the room, and rushed about seeking some way of escape; the

drawing his sword, began making passes at the grating, shouting out,
"avaunt, malignant enchanters! avaunt, ye witchcraft-working rabble! i am
don quixote of la mancha, against whom your evil machinations avail not
nor have any power." and turning upon the cats that were running about
the room, he made several cuts at them. they dashed at the grating and
escaped by it, save one that, finding itself hard pressed by the slashes
of don quixote's sword, flew at his face and held on to his nose tooth
and nail, with the pain of which he began to shout his loudest. the duke
and duchess hearing this, and guessing what it was, ran with all haste to

his room, and as the poor gentleman was striving with all his might to
detach the cat from his face, they opened the door with a master-key and
went in with lights and witnessed the unequal combat. the duke ran
forward to part the combatants, but don quixote cried out aloud, "let no
one take him from me; leave me hand to hand with this demon, this wizard,
this enchanter; i will teach him, i myself, who don quixote of la mancha
is." the cat, however, never minding these threats, snarled and held on;
but at last the duke pulled it off and flung it out of the window. don
quixote was left with a face as full of holes as a sieve and a nose not
in very good condition, and greatly vexed that they did not let him
finish the battle he had been so stoutly fighting with that villain of an
enchanter. they sent for some oil of john's wort, and altisidora herself
with her own fair hands bandaged all the wounded

 parts; and as she did so
she said to him in a low voice. "all these mishaps have befallen thee,
hardhearted knight, for the sin of thy insensibility and obstinacy; and
god grant thy squire sancho may forget to whip himself, so that that
dearly beloved dulcinea of thine may never be released from her
enchantment, that thou mayest never come to her bed, at least while i who
adore thee am alive."

to all this don quixote made no answer except to heave deep sighs, and
then stretched himself on his bed, thanking the duke and duchess for
their kindness, not because he stood in any fear of that bell-ringing
rabble of enchanters in cat shape, but because he recognised their good
intentions in coming to his rescue. the duke and duchess left him to
repose and withdrew greatly grieved at the unfortunate result of the
joke; as they never thought the adventure would have fallen so heavy on
don quixote or cost him

commands shall be obeyed to the letter, as he directs; and say from me to
my lady the duchess that i kiss her hands, and that i beg of her not to
forget to send my letter and bundle to my wife teresa panza by a
messenger; and i will take it as a great favour and will not fail to
serve her in all that may lie within my power; and as you are about it
you may enclose a kiss of the hand to my master don quixote that he may

island."

at this instant a page entered saying, "here is a farmer on business, who
wants to speak to your lordship on a matter of great importance, he
says."

his head down, and to all appearance in terror lest the governor should
carry his threats into effect, for the rogue knew very well how to play
his part.

exceedingly moody and dejected was the sorely wounded don quixote, with
his face bandaged and marked, not by the hand of god, but by the claws of
a cat, mishaps incidental to knight-errantry.

six days he remained without appearing in public, and one night as he lay
awake thinking of his misfortunes and of altisidora's pursuit of him, he
perceived that some one was opening the door of his room with a key, and
he at once made up his mind that the enamoured damsel was coming to make
an assault upon his chastity and put him in danger of failing in the

eyes fixed
on the door, and just as he was expecting to see the love-smitten and
unhappy altisidora make her appearance, he saw coming in a most venerable
duenna, in a long white-bordered veil that covered and enveloped her from
head to foot. between the fingers of her left hand she held a short
lighted candle, while with her right she shaded it to keep the light from
her eyes, which were covered by spectacles of great size, and she
advanced with noiseless steps, treading very softly.

don quixote kept an eye upon her from his watchtower, and observing her
costume and noting her silence, he concluded that it must be some witch
or sorceress that was coming in such a guise to work him some mischief,
and he began crossing himself at a great rate. the spectre still
advanced, and on reaching the middle of the room, looked up and saw the
energy with which don quixote was crossing himself; and if he was scared
by seeing such a figure as hers, she was terrified at the sight of his;
for th

e moment she saw his tall yellow form with the coverlet and the
bandages that disfigured him, she gave a loud scream, and exclaiming,
"jesus! what's this i see?" let fall the candle in her fright, and then
finding herself in the dark, turned about to make off, but stumbling on
her skirts in her consternation, she measured her length with a mighty
fall.

don quixote in his trepidation began saying, "i conjure thee, phantom, or
whatever thou art, tell me what thou art and what thou wouldst with me.
if thou art a soul in torment, say so, and all that my powers can do i
will do for thee; for i am a catholic christian and love to do good to
all the world, and to this end i have embraced the order of
knight-errantry to which i belong, the province of which extends to doing
good even to souls in purgatory."

guessed don quixote's and in a low plaintive voice answered, "senor don
quixote--if so be you are indeed don quixote--i am no phantom or spectre
or soul in purgatory, as you seem to think, but dona rodriguez, duenna of
honour to my lady the duchess, and i come to you with one of those
grievances your worship is wont to redress."

"tell me, senora dona rodriguez," said don quixote, "do you perchance
come to transact any go-between business? because i must tell you i am
not available for anybody's purpose, thanks to the peerless beauty of my
lady dulcinea del toboso. in short, senora dona rodriguez, if you will
leave out and put aside all love messages, you may go and light your
candle and come back, and we will discuss all the commands you have for
me and whatever you wish, saving only, as i said, all seductive
communications."

"i carry nobody's messages, senor

nay, i'm not far enough advanced in years to take to any such childish
tricks. god be praised i have a soul in my body still, and all my teeth
and grinders in my mouth, except one or two that the colds, so common in
this aragon country, have robbed me of. but wait a little, while i go and
light my candle, and i will return immediately and lay my sorrows before
you as before one who relieves those of all the world;" and without
staying for an answer she quitted the room and left don quixote
tranquilly meditating while he waited for her. a thousand thoughts at
once suggested themselves to him on the subject of this new adventure,
and it struck him as being ill done and worse advised in him to expose
himself to the danger of breaking his plighted faith to his lady; and
said he to himself, "who knows but that the devil, being wily and
cunning, may be trying now to entrap me with a duenna, having failed with
empresses, queens, duchesses, marchionesses, and countesses? many a ti

nkind. oh, but that lady did
well who, they say, had at the end of her reception room a couple of
figures of duennas with spectacles and lace-cushions, as if at work, and
those statues served quite as well to give an air of propriety to the
room as if they had been real duennas."

so saying he leaped off the bed, intending to close the door and not
allow senora rodriguez to enter; but as he went to shut it senora
rodriguez returned with a wax candle lighted, and having a closer view of
don quixote, with the coverlet round him, and his bandages and night-cap,
she was alarmed afresh, and retreating a couple of paces, exclaimed, "am
i safe, sir knight? for i don't look upon it as a sign of very great
virtue that your worship should have got up out of bed."

"i may well ask the same, senora," said don quixote; "and i do ask
whether i shall be safe from being assailed and forced?"

"of whom and against whom do you demand that security, sir knight?" said
the duenna.

"of you and aga

and retired than the cave could have been where the treacherous and
daring aeneas enjoyed the fair soft-hearted dido. but give me your hand,

hamete inserts a parenthesis in which he says that to have seen the pair
marching from the door to the bed, linked hand in hand in this way, he
would have given the best of the two tunics he had.

don quixote finally got into bed, and dona rodriguez took her seat on a
chair at some little distance from his couch, without taking off her
spectacles or putting aside the candle. don quixote wrapped the
bedclothes round him and covered himself up completely, leaving nothing
but his face visible, and as soon as they had both regained their
composure he broke silence, saying, "now, senora dona rodriguez, you may
unbosom yourself and out with everything you have in your sorrowful heart
and afflicted bowels; and by me you shall be listened to with chaste
ears, and aided by compassionate exertions."

"i believe it," replied the duenna; "from your worship's gentle and

despised outcast duenna, i am from the asturias of oviedo, and of a
family with which many of the best of the province are connected by
blood; but my untoward fate and the improvidence of my parents, who, i

i passed through it safely and in due season, but because shortly
afterwards my husband died of a certain shock he received, and had i time
to tell you of it i know your worship would be surprised;" and here she
began to weep bitterly and said, "pardon me, senor don quixote, if i am
unable to control myself, for every time i think of my unfortunate
husband my eyes fill up with tears. god bless me, with what an air of
dignity he used to carry my lady behind him on a stout mule as black as

they do now, and ladies rode behind their squires. this much at least i

that glitters, and that same little altisidora has more forwardness than
good looks, and more impudence than modesty; besides being not very
sound, for she has such a disagreeable breath that one cannot bear to be
near her for a moment; and even my lady the duchess--but i'll hold my
tongue, for they say that walls have ears."

"for heaven's sake, dona rodriguez, what ails my lady the duchess?" asked
don quixote.

"adjured in that way," replied the duenna, "i cannot help answering the
question and telling the whole truth. senor don quixote, have you
observed the comeliness of my lady the duchess, that smooth complexion of
hers like a burnished polished sword, those two cheeks of milk and
carmine, that gay lively step with which she treads or rather seems to
spurn the earth, so that one would fancy she went radiating health
wherever she passed? well then, let me tell you she may thank, first of

all god, for this, and next, two issues that she has, one in each leg, by
which all the evil humours, of which the doctors say she is full, are
discharged."

"blessed virgin!" exclaimed don quixote; "and is it possible that my lady
the duchess has drains of that sort? i would not have believed it if the
barefoot friars had told it me; but as the lady dona rodriguez says so,
it must be so. but surely such issues, and in such places, do not
discharge humours, but liquid amber. verily, i do believe now that this
practice of opening issues is a very important matter for the health."

don quixote had hardly said this, when the chamber door flew open with a
loud bang, and with the start

 the noise gave her dona rodriguez let the
candle fall from her hand, and the room was left as dark as a wolf's
mouth, as the saying is. suddenly the poor duenna felt two hands seize
her by the throat, so tightly that she could not croak, while some one
else, without uttering a word, very briskly hoisted up her petticoats,
and with what seemed to be a slipper began to lay on so heartily that
anyone would have felt pity for her; but although don quixote felt it he
never stirred from his bed, but lay quiet and silent, nay apprehensive
that his turn for a drubbing might be coming. nor was the apprehension an
idle one; for leaving the duenna (who did not dare to cry out) well
basted, the silent executioners fell upon don quixote, and stripping him
of the sheet and the coverlet, they pinched him so fast and so hard that
he was driven to defend himself with his fists, and all this in
marvellous silence. the battle lasted nearly half an hour,

 and then the
phantoms fled; dona rodriguez gathered up her skirts, and bemoaning her
fate went out without saying a word to don quixote, and he, sorely
pinched, puzzled, and dejected, remained alone, and there we will leave
him, wondering who could have been the perverse enchanter who had reduced
him to such a state; but that shall be told in due season, for sancho
claims our attention, and the methodical arrangement of the story demands

cide hamete, the painstaking investigator of the minute points of this
veracious history, says that when dona rodriguez left her own room to go
to don quixote's, another duenna who slept with her observed her, and as
all duennas are fond of prying, listening, and sniffing, she followed her
so silently that the good rodriguez never perceived it; and as soon as
the duenna saw her enter don quixot

e's room, not to fail in a duenna's
invariable practice of tattling, she hurried off that instant to report
to the duchess how dona rodriguez was closeted with don quixote. the
duchess told the duke, and asked him to let her and altisidora go and see
what the said duenna wanted with don quixote. the duke gave them leave,
and the pair cautiously and quietly crept to the door of the room and
posted themselves so close to it that they could hear all that was said
inside. but when the duchess heard how the rodriguez had made public the
aranjuez of her issues she could not restrain herself, nor altisidora
either; and so, filled with rage and thirsting for vengeance, they burst
into the room and tormented don quixote and flogged the duenna in the
manner already described; for indigni

ties offered to their charms and
self-esteem mightily provoke the anger of women and make them eager for
revenge. the duchess told the duke what had happened, and he was much
amused by it; and she, in pursuance of her design of making merry and
diverting herself with don quixote, despatched the page who had played
the part of dulcinea in the negotiations for her disenchantment (which
sancho panza in the cares of government had forgotten all about) to
teresa panza his wife with her husband's letter and another from herself,
and also a great string of fine coral beads as a present.

now the history says this page was very sharp and quick-witted; and eager
to serve his lord and lady he set off very willingly for sancho's
village. before he entered it he observed a

 number of women washing in a
brook, and asked them if they could tell him whether there lived there a
woman of the name of teresa panza, wife of one sancho panza, squire to a
knight called don quixote of la mancha. at the question a young girl who
was washing stood up and said, "teresa panza is my mother, and that
sancho is my father, and that knight is our master."

"well then, miss," said the page, "come and show me where your mother is,
for i bring her a letter and a present from your father."

"that i will with all my heart, senor," said the girl, who seemed to be
about fourteen, more or less; and leaving the clothes she was washing to
one of her companions, and without putting

y wife of a most arch-worthy
governor; and as a proof of what i say accept this letter and this
present;" and at the same time he took out of his pocket a string of
coral beads with gold clasps, and placed it on her neck, and said, "this
letter is from his lordship the governor, and the other as well as these
coral beads from my lady the duchess, who sends me to your worship."

teresa stood lost in astonishment, and her daughter just as much, and the
girl said, "may i die but our master don quixote's at the bottom of this;
he must have given father the government or county he so often promised
him."

"that is the truth," said the page; "for it is through senor don quixote
that senor sancho is now governor of the island of barataria, as will be
seen by this letter."

"will your worship read it to me, noble sir?" said teresa; "for though i
can spin i can't read, not a scrap."

"nor i either," said sanchica; "but wait a bit, and i'll go and fetch
some one who can read it, either

every turn; and though a great many of them are not to the purpose, still
they amuse one, and my lady the duchess and the duke praise them highly."

"then you still maintain that all this about sancho's government is true,
senor," said the bachelor, "and that there actually is a duchess who
sends him presents and writes to him? because we, although we have
handled the present and read the letters, don't believe it and suspect it
to be something in the line of our fellow-townsman don quixote, who
fancies that everything is done by enchantment; and for this reason i am
almost ready to say that i'd like to touch and feel your worship to see
whether you are a mere ambassador of the imagination or a man of flesh
and blood."

"all i know, sirs," replied the page, "is that i am a real ambassador,
and that senor sancho panza is governor as a matter of fact, and that my
lord and lady the duke and duchess can give, and have given him this same
government, and that i have heard it s

"senora teresa says more than she is aware of," said the page; "and now
give me something to eat and let me go at once, for i mean to return this
evening."

"come and do penance with me," said the curate at this; "for senora
teresa has more will than means to serve so worthy a guest."

the page refused, but had to consent at last for his own sake; and the
curate took him home with him very gladly, in order to have an
opportunity of questioning him at leisure about don quixote and his
doings. the bachelor offered to write the letters in reply for teresa;
but she did not care to let him mix himself up in her affairs, for she
thought him somewhat given to joking; and so she gave a cake and a couple
of eggs to a young acolyte who was a penman, and he wrote for her two
letters, one for her husband and the other for the duchess, dictated out
of her own head, which are not the worst inserted in this great history,
as will be seen farther on.

 if the truth saves him the falsehood equally
condemns him; and that being the case it is my opinion you should say to
the gentlemen who sent you to me that as the arguments for condemning him
and for absolving him are exactly balanced, they should let him pass
freely, as it is always more praiseworthy to do good than to do evil;
this i would give signed with my name if i knew how to sign; and what i
have said in this case is not out of my own head, but one of the many
precepts my master don quixote gave me the night before i left to become
governor of this island, that came into my mind, and it was this, that
when there was any doubt about the justice of a case i should lean to
mercy; and it is god's will that i should recollect it now, for it fits
this case as if it was made for it."

"that is true," said the majordomo; "and i maintain that lycurgus
himself, who gave laws to the lacedemonians, could not have pronounced a
better decision than the great panza has given; let the mor

twinkling."

the majordomo kept his word, for he felt it against his conscience to
kill so wise a governor by hunger; particularly as he intended to have
done with him that same night, playing off the last joke he was
commissioned to practise upon him.

it came to pass, then, that after he had dined that day, in opposition to
the rules and aphorisms of doctor tirteafuera, as they were taking away
the cloth there came a courier with a letter from don quixote for the
governor. sancho ordered the secretary to read it to himself, and if
there was nothing in it that demanded secrecy to read it aloud. the
secretary did so, and after he had skimmed the contents he said, "it may
well be read aloud, for what senor don quixote writes to your worship
deserves to be printed or written in letters of gold, and it is as
follows."


don quixote of la mancha's letter to sancho panza, governor of the island
of barataria.

think will put me out of favour with the duke and duchess; but though i
am sorry for it i do not care, for after all i must obey my calling
rather than their pleasure, in accordance with the common saying, amicus
plato, sed magis amica veritas. i quote this latin to thee because i
conclude that since thou hast been a governor thou wilt have learned it.
adieu; god keep thee from being an object of pity to anyone.

thy friend, don quixote of la mancha.


sancho listened to the letter with great attention, and it was praised
and considered wise by all who heard it; he then rose up from table, and
calling his secretary shut himself in with him in his own room, and
without putting it off any longer set about answering his master don
quixote at once; and he bade the secretary write down what he told him
without adding or suppressing anything, which he did, and the answer was
to the following effect.

with the order of chivalry he professed, so he determined to ask the duke

time of the festival was now drawing near, and he hoped to win there the
suit of armour which is the prize at festivals of the sort. but one day

suddenly there came in through the door of the great hall two women, as
they afterwards proved to be, draped in mourning from head to foot, one
of whom approaching don quixote flung herself at full length at his feet,
pressing her lips to them, and uttering moans so sad, so deep, and so
doleful that she put all who heard and saw her into a state of
perplexity; and though the duke and duchess supposed it must be some joke
their servants were playing off upon don quixote, still the earnest way
the woman sighed and moaned and wept puzzled them and made them feel
uncertain, until don quixote, touched with compassion, raised her up and
made her unveil herself and r

ought her a
simpleton and a weak creature, they did not think her capable of crazy
pranks. dona rodriguez, at length, turning to her master and mistress
said to them, "will your excellences be pleased to permit me to speak to
this gentleman for a moment, for it is requisite i should do so in order
to get successfully out of the business in which the boldness of an
evil-minded clown has involved me?"

the duke said that for his part he gave her leave, and that she might
speak with senor don quixote as much as she liked.

she then, turning to don quixote and addressing herself to him said,
"some days since, valiant knight, i gave you an account of the injustice
and treachery of a wicked farmer to my dearly beloved daughter, the

refore, before you take the
road, i would that you challenge this froward rustic, and compel him to
marry my daughter in fulfillment of the promise he gave her to become her
husband before he seduced her; for to expect that my lord the duke will
do me justice is to ask pears from the elm tree, for the reason i stated
privately to your worship; and so may our lord grant you good health and
forsake us not."

to these words don quixote replied very gravely and solemnly, "worthy
duenna, check your tears, or rather dry them, and spare your sighs, for i
take it upon myself to obtain redress for your daughter, for whom it
would have been better not to have been so ready to believe lovers'
promises, which are for the most part quickly made and very slowly
performed; and so, with my lord the duke's leave, i will at once go in
quest of this inhuman youth, and will find him out and challenge him and
slay him, if so be he refus

 that he
accepted the challenge in the name of his vassal, and fixed six days
thence as the time, the courtyard of the castle as the place, and for
arms the customary ones of knights, lance and shield and full armour,
with all the other accessories, without trickery, guile, or charms of any
sort, and examined and passed by the judges of the field. "but first of
all," he said, "it is requisite that this worthy duenna and unworthy
damsel should place their claim for justice in the hands of don quixote;
for otherwise nothing can be done, nor can the said challenge be brought
to a lawful issue."

"i do so place it," replied the duenna.

"and i too," added her daughter, all in tears and covered with shame and
confusion.

this declaration having been made, and the duke having settled in his own
mind what he would do in the matter, the ladies in black withdrew, and
the duchess gave orders that for the future they were not to be treated
as servants of hers, but as lady adventurers who

all were greatly amused by teresa panza's letter, but particularly the
duke and duchess; and the duchess asked don quixote's opinion whether
they might open the letter that had come for the governor, which she
suspected must be very good. don quixote said that to gratify them he
would open it, and did so, and found that it ran as follows.


teresa panza's letter to her husband sancho panza.

i got thy letter, sancho of my soul, and i promise thee and swear as a
catholic christian that i was within two fingers' breadth of going mad i

neither the curate, nor the barber, nor the bachelor, nor even the

out the dress i am going to make for our daughter out of thy suit. i sent
some acorns to my lady the duchess; i wish they had been gold. send me

the letters were applauded, laughed over, relished, and admired; and
then, as if to put the seal to the business, the courier arrived,
bringing the one sancho sent to don quixote, and this, too, was read out,
and it raised some doubts as to the governor's simplicity. the duchess
withdrew to hear from the page about his adventures in sancho's village,
which he narrated at full length without leaving a single circumstance
unmentioned. he gave her the acorns, and also a cheese which teresa had
given him as being particularly good and superior to those of tronchon.
the duchess received it with greatest delight, in which we will leave

keeping up this noise, tumult, and uproar, they came to where sancho
stood dazed and bewildered by what he saw and heard, and as they
approached one of them called out to him, "arm at once, your lordship, if
you would not have yourself destroyed and the whole island lost."

"what have i to do with arming?" said sancho. "what do i know about arms
or supports? better leave all that to my master don quixote, who will
settle it and make all safe in a trice; for i, sinner that i am, god help
me, don't understand these scuffles."

"ah, senor governor," said another, "what slackness of mettle this is!
arm yourself; here are arms for you, offensive and defensive; come out to
the plaza and be our leader and captain; it falls upon you by right, for
you are our governor."

and as the young man was in flanders, whither he had fled to escape

for him a gascon lacquey, named tosilos, first of all carefully
instructing him in all he had to do. two days later the duke told don
quixote that in four days from that time his opponent would present
himself on the field of battle armed as a knight, and would mainta

letting his noble hosts see what the might of his strong arm was capable

sancho, that the morisco women seldom or never engage in amours with the

christian than of lovemaking, would not trouble herself about the
attentions of this heir."

"god grant it," said sancho, "for it would be a bad business for both of
them; but now let me be off, friend ricote, for i want to reach where my
master don quixote is to-night."

began to pick away the clay from the hole until in a short time he had
made room for the beast to pass easily, and this accomplished, taking him
by the halter, he proceeded to traverse the cavern to see if there was
any outlet at the other end. he advanced, sometimes in the dark,
sometimes without light, but never without fear; "god almighty help me!"
said he to himself; "this that is a misadventure to me would make a good
adventure for my master don quixote. he would have been sure to take
these depths and dungeons for flowery gardens or the palaces of galiana,
and would have counted upon issuing out of this darkness and imprisonment
into some blooming meadow; but i, unlucky that i am, hopeless and
spiritless, expect at every step another pit deeper than the first to
open under my feet and swallow me up for good; 'welcome evil, if thou

that this road, which appeared to him the road to the other world, led to
some opening.

here cide hamete leaves him, and returns to don quixote, who in high
spirits and satisfaction was looking forward to the day fixed for the
battle he was to fight with him who had robbed dona rodriguez's daughter
of her honour, for whom he hoped to obtain satisfaction for the wrong and
injury shamefully done to her. it came to pass, then, that having sallied
forth one morning to practise and exercise himself in what he would have
to do in the encounter he expected to find himself engaged in the next
day, as he was putting rocinante through his

he pulled him up, however, without a fall, and coming a little closer
examined the hole without dismounting; but as he was looking at it he
heard loud cries proceeding from it, and by listening attentively was
able to make out that he who uttered them was saying, "ho, above there!
is there any christian that hears me, or any charitable gentleman that
will take pity on a sinner buried alive, on an unfortunate disgoverned
governor?"

it struck don quixote that it was the voice of sancho panza he heard,
whereat he was taken aback and amazed, and raising his own voice as much
as he could, he cried out, "who is below there? who is that complaining?"

"who should be here, or who should complain," was the answer, "but the
forlorn sancho panza, for his sins and for his ill-luck governor of the
island of barataria, squire that was to the famous knight don quixote of
la mancha?"

when don quixote heard this his amazement was redoubled and his

away by this idea he exclaimed, "i conjure thee by everything
that as a catholic christian i can conjure thee by, tell me who thou art;
and if thou art a soul in torment, tell me what thou wouldst have me do
for thee; for as my profession is to give aid and succour to those that
need it in this world, it will also extend to aiding and succouring the
distressed of the other, who cannot help themselves."

"in that case," answered the voice, "your worship who speaks to me must
be my master don quixote of la mancha; nay, from the tone of the voice it
is plain it can be nobody else."

"don quixote i am," replied don quixote, "he whose profession it is to
aid and succour the living and the dead in their necessities; wherefore
tell me who thou art, for thou art keeping me in suspense; because, if
thou art my squire sancho panza, and art dead, since the devils have not
carried thee off, and thou art by god's mercy in purgatory, our holy
mother the roman catholic church has intercessory me

ans sufficient to
release thee from the pains thou art in; and i for my part will plead
with her to that end, so far as my substance will go; without further
delay, therefore, declare thyself, and tell me who thou art."

"by all that's good," was the answer, "and by the birth of whomsoever
your worship chooses, i swear, senor don quixote of la mancha, that i am
your squire sancho panza, and that i have never died all my life; but
that, having given up my government for reasons that would require more
time to explain, i fell last night into this pit where i am now, and
dapple is witness and won't let me lie, for more by token he is here with
me."

nor was this all; one would have fancied the ass understood what sancho
said, because that moment he began to bray so loudly that the whole cave
rang again.

"famous testimo

ny!" exclaimed don quixote; "i know that bray as well as
if i was its mother, and thy voice too, my sancho. wait while i go to the
duke's castle, which is close by, and i will bring some one to take thee
out of this pit into which thy sins no doubt have brought thee."

"go, your worship," said sancho, "and come back quick for god's sake; for
i cannot bear being buried alive any longer, and i'm dying of fear."

don quixote left him, and hastened to the castle to tell the duke and
duchess what had happened sancho, and they were not a little astonished
at it; they could easily understand his having fallen, from the
confirmatory circumstance of the cave which had been in existence there
from time immemorial; but they could not imagine how he had quitted the
government without their receiving any intimation of his coming. to be
brief, they fetched ropes and tackle, as the saying is, and by dint of

don't deserve, i think, to come out in this fashion; but 'man proposes

best; and 'as the occasion, so the behaviour;' and 'let nobody say "i
won't drink of this water;"' and 'where one thinks there are flitches,
there are no pegs;' god knows my meaning and that's enough; i say no
more, though i could."

"be not angry or annoyed at what thou hearest, sancho," said don quixote,
"or there will never be an end of it; keep a safe conscience and let them
say what they like; for trying to stop slanderers' tongues is like trying
to put gates to the open plain. if a governor comes out of his government
rich, they say he has been a thief; and if he comes out poor, that he has
been a noodle and a blockhead."

"they'll be pretty sure this time," said sancho, "to set me down for a
fool rather than a thief."

thus talking, and surrounded by boys and a crowd of people,

 i entered it. i
asked no loan of anybody, nor did i try to fill my pocket; and though i
meant to make some useful laws, i made hardly any, as i was afraid they
would not be kept; for in that case it comes to the same thing to make
them or not to make them. i quitted the island, as i said, without any
escort except my ass; i fell into a pit, i pushed on through it, until
this morning by the light of the sun i saw an outlet, but not so easy a
one but that, had not heaven sent me my master don quixote, i'd have
stayed there till the end of the world. so now my lord and lady duke and
duchess, here is your governor sancho panza, who in the bare ten days he
has held the government has come by the knowledge that he would not give
anything to be governor, not to say of an island, but of the whole world;
and that point being settled, kissing your worships' feet, and imitating
the game of the boys when they say, 'leap thou, and give me one,' i take

here sancho brought his long speech to an end, don quixote having been
the whole time in dread of his uttering a host of absurdities; and when
he found him leave off with so few, he thanked heaven in his heart. the
duke embraced sancho and told him he was heartily sorry he had given up
the government so soon, but that he would see that he was provided with
some other post on his estate less onerous and more profitable. the
duchess also embraced him, and gave orders that he should be taken good

their majordomo returned the same day, and gave them a minute account of
almost every word and deed that sancho uttered or did during the time;

island and sancho's fright and departure, with which they were not a
little amused. after this the history goes on to say that the day fixed
for the battle arrived, and that the duke, after having repeatedly
instructed his lacquey tosilos how to deal with don quixote so as to
vanquish him without killing or wounding him, gave orders to have the
heads removed from the lances, telling don quixote that christian
charity, on which he plumed himself, could not suffer the battle to be
fought with so much risk and danger to life; and that he must be content
with the offer of a battlefield on his territory (though that was against
the decree of the holy council, which prohibits all challenges of the
sort) and not push such an arduous venture to its extreme l

the first person to enter the field and the lists was the master of the
ceremonies, who surveyed and paced the whole ground to see that there was
nothing unfair and nothing concealed to make the combatants stumble or
fall; then the duennas entered and seated themselves, enveloped in
mantles covering their eyes, nay even their bosoms, and displaying no
slight emotion as don quixote appeared in the lists. shortly afterwards,
accompanied by several trumpets and mounted on a powerful steed that
threatened to crush the whole place, the great lacquey tosilos made his
appearance on one side of the courtyard with his visor down and stiffly
cased in a suit of stout shining armour. the horse was a manifest
frieslander, broad-backed and flea-bitten, and with half a hundred of
wool hanging to each of his fetlocks. the gallant combatant came well
primed by his master the duke

as to how he was to bear himself against
the valiant don quixote of la mancha; being warned that he must on no
account slay him, but strive to shirk the first encounter so as to avoid
the risk of killing him, as he was sure to do if he met him full tilt. he
crossed the courtyard at a walk, and coming to where the duennas were
placed stopped to look at her who demanded him for a husband; the marshal
of the field summoned don quixote, who had already presented himself in
the courtyard, and standing by the side of tosilos he addressed the
duennas, and asked them if they consented that don quixote of la mancha
should do battle for their right. they said they did, and that whatever
he should do in that behalf they declared rightly done, final and valid.
by this time the duke and duchess had taken their places in a gallery
commanding the enclosure, which was filled to overflowing with a
multitude of people eager to see t

his perilous and unparalleled
encounter. the conditions of the combat were that if don quixote proved
the victor his antagonist was to marry the daughter of dona rodriguez;
but if he should be vanquished his opponent was released from the promise
that was claimed against him and from all obligations to give
satisfaction. the master of the ceremonies apportioned the sun to them,
and stationed them, each on the spot where he was to stand. the drums
beat, the sound of the trumpets filled the air, the earth trembled under
foot, the hearts of the gazing crowd were full of anxiety, some

 hoping
for a happy issue, some apprehensive of an untoward ending to the affair,
and lastly, don quixote, commending himself with all his heart to god our
lord and to the lady dulcinea del toboso, stood waiting for them to give
the necessary signal for the onset. our lacquey, however, was thinking of
something very different; he only thought of what i am now going to
mention.

it seems that as he stood contemplating his enemy she struck him as the
most beautiful woman he had ever seen all his life; and the little blind
boy whom in our streets they commonly call love had no mind to let slip

 drove a dart
two yards long into the poor lacquey's left side and pierced his heart
through and through; which he was able to do quite at his ease, for love
is invisible, and comes in and goes out as he likes, without anyone
calling him to account for what he does. well then, when they gave the
signal for the onset our lacquey was in an ecstasy, musing upon the
beauty of her whom he had already made mistress of his liberty, and so he
paid no attention to the sound of the trumpet, unlike don quixote, who
was off the instant he heard it, and, at the highest speed rocinante was
capable of, set out to meet his enemy, his good squire sancho shouting
lustily as he saw him start, "god guide thee, cream and flower of
knights-errant! god give thee the victory, for thou hast the right on thy
side!" but though tosilos saw don quixote coming at him he never stirred
a step from the spot where he was posted; and instead of doing so called
loudly to the marshal of the field, to whom when he came

r do not marry that lady?" "just so," was the answer. "well then," said
the lacquey, "i feel qualms of conscience, and i should lay a-heavy
burden upon it if i were to proceed any further with the combat; i
therefore declare that i yield myself vanquished, and that i am willing
to marry the lady at once."

the marshal of the field was lost in astonishment at the words of
tosilos; and as he was one of those who were privy to the arrangement of
the affair he knew not what to say in reply. don quixote pulled up in mid
career when he saw that his enemy was not coming on to the attack. the
duke could not make out the reason why the battle did not go on; but the
marshal of the field hastened to him to let him know what tosilos said,
and he was amazed and extremely angry at it. in the meantime tosilos
advanced to where dona rodriguez sat and said in a loud voice, "senora, i
am willing to marry your daughter, and i have no wish to obtain by strife
and fighting what i can obtain in peace an

d without any risk to my life."

the valiant don quixote heard him, and said, "as that is the case i am
released and absolved from my promise; let them marry by all means, and
as 'god our lord has given her, may saint peter add his blessing.'"

the duke had now descended to the courtyard of the castle, and going up
to tosilos he said to him, "is it true, sir knight, that you yield
yourself vanquished, and that moved by scruples of conscience you wish to
marry this damsel?"

"it is, senor," replied tosilos.

"and he does well," said sancho,

was failing him, and
he could not remain so long shut up in that confined space. they removed
it in all haste, and his lacquey features were revealed to public gaze.
at this sight dona rodriguez and her daughter raised a mighty outcry,
exclaiming, "this is a trick! this is a trick! they have put tosilos, my
lord the duke's lacquey, upon us in place of the real husband. the
justice of god and the king against such trickery, not to say roguery!"

"do not distress yourselves, ladies," said don quixote; "for this is no
trickery or roguery; or if it is, it is not the duke who is at the bottom
of it, but those wicked enchanters who persecute me, and who, jealous of
my reaping the glory of this victory, have turned your husband's features
into those of this person, who you say is a lacquey of the duke's; take
my advice, and notwithstanding the malice of my enemies marry him, for
beyond a doubt he is the one you wish for a husband."

when the duke heard this all his anger was near vanishi

ng in a fit of
laughter, and he said, "the things that happen to senor don quixote are
so extraordinary that i am ready to believe this lacquey of mine is not
one; but let us adopt this plan and device; let us put off the marriage
for, say, a fortnight, and let us keep this person about whom we are
uncertain in close confinement, and perhaps in the course of that time he
may return to his original shape; for the spite which the enchanters
entertain against senor don quixote cannot last so long, especially as it
is of so little advantage to them to practise these deceptions and
transformations."

"oh, senor," said sancho, "those scoundrels are well used to changing
whatever concerns my master from one thing into another. a knight that he
overcame some time back, called the knight of the mirrors, they turned
into the shape of the bachelor samson carrasco of our town and a great
friend of ours; and my lady dulcinea del toboso they have turned into a

here the rodriguez's daughter exclaimed, "let him be who he may, this man
that claims me for a wife; i am thankful to him for the same, for i had
rather be the lawful wife of a lacquey than the cheated mistress of a
gentleman; though he who played me false is nothing of the kind."

to be brief, all the talk and all that had happened ended in tosilos
being shut up until it was seen how his transformation turned out. all
hailed don quixote as victor, but the greater number were vexed and
disappointed at finding that the combatants they had been so anxiously
waiting for had not battered one another to pieces, just as the boys are
disappointed when the man they are waiting to see hanged does not come
out, because the prosecution or the court has pardoned him. the people
dispersed, the duke and don quixote returned to the castle, they locked

knight, and he felt too that he would have to render a strict account to

of my government bred in my wife teresa panza's breast would end in my
going back now to the vagabond adventures of my master don quixote of la

the acorns, for if she had not sent them i'd have been sorry, and she'd
have shown herself ungrateful. it is a comfort to me that they can't call
that present a bribe; for i had got the government already when she sent
them, and it's but reasonable that those who have had a good turn done

t made his appearance at an early hour in full armour in the
courtyard of the castle. the whole household of the castle were watching
him from the corridors, and the duke and duchess, too, came out to see
him. sancho was mounted on his dapple, with his alforjas, valise, and
proven, supremely happy because the duke's majordomo, the same that had
acted the part of the trifaldi, had given him a little purse with two
hundred gold crowns to meet the necessary expenses of the road, but of
this don quixote knew nothing as yet. while all were, as has been said,
observing him, suddenly from among the duennas and handmaidens the
impudent and witty altisidora lifted up her voice and said in pathetic
tones:

give ear, cruel knight;
  draw rein; where's the need
of spurring the flanks
  of that ill-broken steed?
from what art thou flying?
  no dragon i am,
not even a sheep,
  but a tender young lamb.
thou hast jilted a maiden
  as fair to behold
as nymph of diana
  or venus of old.

all the while the unhappy altisidora was bewailing herself in the above
strain don quixote stood staring at her; and without uttering a word in
reply to her he turned round to sancho and said, "sancho my friend, i
conjure thee by the life of thy forefathers tell me the truth; say, hast
thou by any chance taken the three kerchiefs and the garters this
love-sick maid speaks of?"

to this sancho made answer, "the three kerchiefs i have; but the garters,
as much as 'over the hills of ubeda.'"

the duchess was amazed at altisidora's assurance; she knew that she was
bold, lively,

u, sir knight, that after

castle, you should have ventured to carry off even three kerchiefs, not

with your reputation. restore her garters, or else i defy you to mortal
combat, for i am not afraid of rascally enchanters changing or altering
my features as they changed his who encountered you into those of my
lacquey, tosilos."

"god forbid," said don quixote, "that i should draw my sword against your
illustrious person from which i have received such great favours. the
kerchiefs i will restore, as sancho says he has them; as to the garters
that is impossible, for i have not got them, neither has he; and if your
handmaiden here will look in her hiding-places, depend upon it she will
find them. i have never been a thief, my lord duke, nor do i mean to be

"and may god so prosper it, senor don quixote," said the duchess, "that
we may always hear good news of your exploits; god speed you; for the
longer you stay, the more you inflame the hearts of the damsels who
behold you; and as for this one of mine, i will so chastise her that she
will not transgress again, either with her eyes or with her words."

"one word and no more, o valiant don quixote, i ask you to hear," said
altisidora, "and that is that i beg your pardon about the theft of the

i wanted to deal in them, opportunities came ready enough to me in my
government."

don quixote bowed his head, and saluted the duke and duchess and all the
bystanders, and wheeling rocinante round, sancho following him on dapple,
he rode out of the castle, shaping his course for saragossa.

in conversation of this sort the knight and squire errant were pursuing
their journey, when, after they had gone a little more than half a
league, they perceived some dozen men dressed like labourers stretched
upon their cloaks on the grass of a green meadow eating their dinner.
they had beside them what seemed to be white sheets concealing some
objects under them, standing upright or lying flat, and arranged at
intervals. don quixote approached the diners, and, saluting them
courteously first, he asked them what it was those cloths covered.
"senor," answered one of the party, "under these cloths are some images
carved in relief intended for a retablo we are putting up in our village;
we carry them covered up that they may not be soiled, and on our
shoulders that they may not be broken."

"with your good leave," said don quixote, "i should like to see them; for
images that are carried so carefully no doubt must be fi

matter of fact there is not one of them that
does not stand us in more than fifty ducats; and that your worship may

up from his dinner he went and uncovered the first image, which proved to
be one of saint george on horseback with a serpent writhing at his feet
and the lance thrust down its throat with all that fierceness that is
usually depicted. the whole group was one blaze of gold, as the saying
is. on seeing it don quixote said, "that knight was one of the best
knights-errant the army of heaven ever owned; he was called don saint
george, and he was moreover a defender of maidens. let us see this next
one."

the man uncovered it, and it was seen to be that of saint martin on his
horse, dividing his cloak with the beggar. the instant don quixote saw it
he said, "this knight too was one of the christian adventurers, but i
believe he was generous rather than valiant, as thou mayest perceive,

it; no doubt it was winter at the time, for otherwise he would have given
him the whole of it, so charitable was he."

"it was not that, most likely," said sancho, "but that he held with the
proverb that says, 'for giving and keeping there's need of brains.'"

don quixote laughed, and asked them to take off the next cloth,
underneath which was seen the image of the patron saint of the spains
seated on horseback, his sword stained with blood, trampling on moors and
treading heads underfoot; and on seeing it don quixote exclaimed, "ay,
this is a knight, and of the squadrons of christ! this one is called don
saint james the moorslayer, one of the bravest saints and knights the
world ever had or heaven has now."

they then raised another cloth which it appea

falling from his horse, with all the details that are usually given in
representations of his conversion. when don quixote saw it, rendered in
such lifelike style that one would have said christ was speaking and paul
answering, "this," he said, "was in his time the greatest enemy that the
church of god our lord had, and the greatest champion it will ever have;
a knight-errant in life, a steadfast saint in death, an untiring labourer
in the lord's vineyard, a teacher of the gentiles, whose school was
heaven, and whose instructor and master was jesus christ himself."

there were no more images, so don quixote

far, know not what i have won by dint of my sufferings; but if my
dulcinea del toboso were to be released from hers, perhaps with mended
fortunes and a mind restored to itself i might direct my steps in a
better path than i am following at present."

"may god hear and sin be deaf," said sancho to this.

the men were filled with wonder, as well at the figure as at the words of
don quixote, though they did not understand one half of what he meant by
them. they finished their dinner, took their images on their backs, and
bidding farewell to don quixote resumed their journey.

sancho was amazed afresh at the extent of his master's knowledge, as much
as if he had never known him, for it seemed to him that there was no
story or event in the world that he had not at his fingers' ends and
fixed in his memory, and he said to him, "in truth, master mine, if this
that has happened

with our bodies, nor have we been left famishing; blessed be god that he

"thou sayest well, sancho," said don quixote, "but remember all times are
not alike nor do they always run the same way; and these things the
vulgar commonly call omens, which are not based upon any natural reason,
will by him who is wise be esteemed and reckoned happy accidents merely.
one of these believers in omens will get up of a morning, leave his

meeting those images has been to me a most happy occurrence."

"i can well believe it," said sancho; "but i wish your worship would tell
me what is the reason that the spaniards, when they are about to give
battle, in calling on that saint james the moorslayer, say 'santiago and
close spain!' is spain, then, open, so that it is needful to close it; or
what is the meaning of this form?"

"thou art very simple, sancho," said don quixote; "god, look you, gave
that great knight of the red cross to spain as her patron saint and
protector, especially in those hard struggles the spaniards had with the
moors; and therefore they invoke and call upon him as their defender in
all their battles; and in these he has been many a time seen beating
down, trampling under foot, destroying and slaughtering the hagarene
squadrons in the sight of all; of which fact i could give thee many
examples recorded in truthful spanish histories."

whom they call
love must have cruelly pierced and wounded her; they say he is a little
blind urchin who, though blear-eyed, or more properly speaking sightless,
if he aims at a heart, be it ever so small, hits it and pierces it
through and through with his arrows. i have heard it said too that the
arrows of love are blunted and robbed of their points by maidenly modesty
and reserve; but with this altisidora it seems they are sharpened rather
than blunted."

"bear in mind, sancho," said don quixote, "that love is influenced by no
consideration, recognises no restraints of reason, and is of the same
nature as death, that assails alike the lofty palaces of kings and the
humble cabins of shepherds; and when it takes entire possession of a
heart, the first thing it does is to banish fear and shame from it; and
so without shame altisidora declared her passion, which excited in my
mind embarrassment rather than commiseration."

"notable cruelty!" exclaimed sancho; "unheard-of ingratitud

 of these things by
itself, or what all together, could have made her fall in love with you?
for indeed and in truth many a time i stop to look at your worship from
the sole of your foot to the topmost hair of your head, and i see more to
frighten one than to make one fall in love; moreover i have heard say
that beauty is the first and main thing that excites love, and as your
worship has none at all, i don't know what the poor creature fell in love
with."

"recollect, sancho," replied don quixote, "there are two sorts of beauty,
one of the mind, the other of the body; that of the mind displays and
exhibits itself in intelligence, in modesty, in honourable conduct, in
generosity, in good breeding; and all these qualities are possible and
may exist in an ugly man; and when it is this sort of beauty and not that
of the body that is the attraction, love is apt to spring up suddenly and
violently. i, sancho, perceive clearly enough that i am not beautiful,
but at the same time i know

i am not hideous; and it is enough for an
honest man not to be a monster to be an object of love, if only he
possesses the endowments of mind i have mentioned."

while engaged in this discourse they were making their way through a wood
that lay beyond the road, when suddenly, without expecting anything of
the kind, don quixote found himself caught in some nets of green cord
stretched from one tree to another; and unable to conceive what it could
be, he said to sancho, "sancho, it strikes me this affair of these nets
will prove one of the strangest adventures imaginable. may i die if the
enchanters that persecute me are not trying to entangle me in them and
delay my journey, by way of revenge for my obduracy towards altisidora.
well then let me tell them that if these nets, instead of being green
cord, were mad

loose upon their shoulders and was crowned with garlands twined with
green laurel and red everlasting; and their years to all appearance were
not under fifteen nor above eighteen.

such was the spectacle that filled sancho with amazement, fascinated don
quixote, made the sun halt in his course to behold them, and held all
four in a strange silence. one of the shepherdesses, at length, was the
first to speak and said to don quixote, "hold, sir knight, and do not
break these nets; for they are not spread here to do you any harm, but
only for our amusement; and as i know you will ask why they have been put
up, and who we are, i will tell you in a few words. in a village some two
leagues from this, where there are many people of quality and rich
gentlefolk, it was agreed upon by a number of friends and relations to
come with their wives, sons and daughters, neighbours, friends and
kinsmen, and make holiday in this spo

first day of our coming here; we have a few of what they say are called
field-tents pitched among the trees on the bank of an ample brook that
fertilises all these meadows; last night we spread these nets in the
trees here to snare the silly little birds that startled by the noise we
make may fly into them. if you please to be our guest, senor, you will be
welcomed heartily and courteously, for here just now neither care nor
sorrow shall enter."

she held her peace and said no more, and don quixote made answer, "of a
truth, fairest lady, actaeon when he unexpectedly beheld diana bathing in
the stream could not have been more fascinated and wonderstruck than i at
the sight of your beauty. i commend your mode of entertainment, and thank
you for the kindness of your invitation; and if i can serve you, you may
command me with full confidence of being obeyed, for my profession is
none other than to show myself grateful, and ready to serve persons of
all conditions, but especially person

s of quality such as your appearance
indicates; and if, instead of taking up, as they probably do, but a small
space, these nets took up the whole surface of the globe, i would seek
out new worlds through which to pass, so as not to break them; and that
ye may give some degree of credence to this exaggerated language of mine,
know that it is no less than don quixote of la mancha that makes this
declaration to you, if indeed it be that such a name has reached your
ears."

"ah! friend of my soul," instantly exclaimed the other shepherdess, "what
great good fortune has befallen us! seest thou this gentleman we have
before us? well then let me tell thee he is the most valiant and the most
devoted and the most courteous gentleman in all the world, unless a
history of his achievements that has been printed and i have read is

who is with him is one sancho panza his squire, whose drolleries none can

"that's true," said sancho; "i am that same droll and squire you speak
of, and this gentleman is my master don quixote of la mancha, the same
that's in the history and that they talk about."

"oh, my friend," said the other, "let us entreat him to stay; for it will
give our fathers and brothers infinite pleasure; i too have heard just
what thou hast told me of the valour of the one and the drolleries of the
other; and what is more, of him they say that he is the most constant and
loyal lover that was ever heard of, and that his lady is one dulcinea del

"and justly awarded," said don quixote, "unless, indeed, your unequalled
beauty makes it a matter of doubt. but spare yourselves the trouble,
ladies, of pressing me to stay, for the urgent calls of my profession do
not allow me to take rest under any circumstances."

at this instant there came up to the spot where the four stood a brother
of one of the two shepherdesses, like them in shepherd costume, and as
richly and gaily dressed as they were. they told him that their companion
was the valiant don quixote of la mancha, an

squire, of whom he knew already from having read their history. the gay
shepherd offered him his services and begged that he would accompany him
to their tents, and don quixote had to give way and comply. and now the
game was started, and the nets were filled with a variety of birds that
deceived by the colour fell into the danger they were flying from.
upwards of thirty persons, all gaily attired as shepherds and
shepherdesses, assembled on the spot, and were at once informed who don
quixote and his squire were, whereat they were not a little delighted, as
they knew of him already through his history. they repaired to the tents,
where they found tables laid ou

t, and choicely, plentifully, and neatly
furnished. they treated don quixote as a person of distinction, giving
him the place of honour, and all observed him, and were full of
astonishment at the spectacle. at last the cloth being removed, don
quixote with great composure lifted up his voice and said:

"one of the greatest sins that men are guilty of is--some will say
pride--but i say ingratitude, going by the common saying that hell is
full of ingrates. this sin, so far as it has lain in my power, i have
endeavoured to avoid ever since i have enjoyed the facult

r me, ladies and
gentlemen."

on hearing this sancho, who had been listening with great attention,
cried out in a loud voice, "is it possible there is anyone in the world
who will dare to say and swear that this master of mine is a madman? say,
gentlemen shepherds, is there a village priest, be he ever so wise or
learned, who could say what my master has said; or is there
knight-errant, whatever renown he may have as a man of valour, that could
offer what my master has offered now?"

don quixote turned upon sancho, and with a countenance glowing with anger
said to him, "is it possible, sancho, there is anyone in the whole world
who will say thou art not a fool, with a lining to match, and i know not
what trimmings of impertinence and roguery? who asked thee to meddle in
my affairs, or to inquire whether i am a wise man or a blockhead? hold
thy peace; answer me not a word; saddle rocinante if he be unsaddled; and

n a great rage, and showing his anger plainly, he rose
from his seat, leaving the company lost in wonder, and making them feel
doubtful whether they ought to regard him as a madman or a rational
being. in the end, though they sought to dissuade him from involving
himself in such a challenge, assuring him they admitted his gratitude as
fully established, and needed no fresh proofs to be convinced of his
valiant spirit, as those related in the history of his exploits were
sufficient, still don quixote persisted in his resolve; and mounted on
rocinante, bracing his buckler on his arm and grasping his lance, he
posted himself in the middle of a high road that was not far from the
green meadow. sancho followed on dapple, together with all the members of
the pastoral gathering, eager to see what would be the upshot of his
vainglorious and extraordinary proposal.

don quixote, then, having, as has been said, planted himself in the
middle of the road, made the welkin ring with words to thi

to maintain by arms that the beauty and courtesy enshrined in the nymphs
that dwell in these meadows and groves surpass all upon earth, putting
aside the lady of my heart, dulcinea del toboso. wherefore, let him who
is of the opposite opinion come on, for here i await him."

twice he repeated the same words, and twice they fell unheard by any
adventurer; but fate, that was guiding affairs for him from better to
better, so ordered it that short

ly afterwards there appeared on the road
a crowd of men on horseback, many of them with lances in their hands, all
riding in a compact body and in great haste. no sooner had those who were
with don quixote seen them than they turned about and withdrew to some
distance from the road, for they knew that if they stayed some harm might
come to them; but don quixote with intrepid heart stood his ground, and
sancho panza shielded himself with rocinante's hind-quarters. the troop
of lancers came up, and one of them who was in advance began shouting to
don quixote, "get out of the way, you son of the devil, or these bulls
will knock you to pieces!"

"rabble!" returned don quixote, "i care nothing for bulls, be they the
fiercest jarama breeds on its banks. confess at once, scoundrels, that

the herdsman had no time to reply, nor don quixote to get out of the way
even if he wished; and so the drove of fierce bulls and tame bullocks,
together with the crowd of herdsmen and others who were taking them to be
penned up in a village where they were to be run the next day, passed
over don quixote and over sancho, rocinante and dapple, hurling them all
to the earth and rolling them over on the ground. sancho was left
crushed, don quixote scared, dapple belaboured and rocinante in no very
sound condition.

they all got up, however, at length, and don quixote in great haste,
stumbling here and falling there, started off running after the drove,
shouting out, "hold! stay! ye rascally rabble, a single knight awaits
you, and he is not of the temper or opinion of those who say, 'for a
flying enemy make a bridge of silver.'" the retreating party in their
haste, however, did not stop for that, or heed his menaces any more than

enraged than avenged he sat down on the road to wait until sancho,
rocinante and dapple came up. when they reached him master and man

imitation arcadia, and more in humiliation than contentment, they
continued their journey.

a clear limpid spring which they discovered in a cool grove relieved don
quixote and sancho of the dust and fatigue due to the unpolite behaviour
of the bulls, and by the side of this, having turned dapple and rocinante
loose without headstall or bridle, the forlorn pair, master and man,
seated themselves. sancho had recourse to the larder of his alforjas and
took out of them what he called the prog; don quixote rinsed his mouth
and bathed his face, by which cooling process his flagg

ing energies were
revived. out of pure vexation he remained without eating, and out of pure
politeness sancho did not venture to touch a morsel of what was before
him, but waited for his master to act as taster. seeing, however, that,
absorbed in thought, he was forgetting to carry the bread to his mouth,
he said never a word, and trampling every sort of good breeding under
foot, began to stow away in his paunch the bread and cheese that came to
his hand.

"eat, sancho my friend," said don quixote; "support life, which is of
more consequence to thee than to me, and leave me to die under the pain
of my thoughts and pressure of my misfortunes. i was born, sancho, to
live dying, and thou to die eating; and to prove the truth of what i say,
look at me, printed in histories, famed in arms, courteous in behaviour,
honoured by princes, courted by maidens; and after all, when i looked
forward to palms, triumphs, and crowns, won and earned by my valiant
deeds, i have this morning seen myse

from that, i mean to do as the cobbler does, who stretches the leather
with his teeth until he makes it reach as far as he wants. i'll stretch
out my life by eating until it reaches the end heaven has fixed for it;
and let me tell you, senor, there's no greater folly than to think of
dying of despair as your worship does; take my advice, and after eating
lie down and sleep a bit on this green grass-mattress, and you will see
that when you awake you'll feel something better."

don quixote did as he recommended, for it struck him that sancho's
reasoning was more like a philosopher's than a blockhead's, and said he,
"sancho, if thou wilt do for me what i am going to tell thee my ease of
mind would be more assured and my heaviness of heart not so great; and it
is this; to go aside a little while i am sleeping in accordance with thy
advice, and, making bare thy carcase to the air, to give thyself three or
four hundred lashes with rocinante's reins, on account of the three

let me tell your worship that for a man to whip himself in cold blood is
a hard thing, especially if the stripes fall upon an ill-nourished and
worse-fed body. let my lady dulcinea have patience, and when she is least
expecting it, she will see me made a riddle of with whipping, and 'until
death it's all life;' i mean that i have still life in me, and the desire
to make good what i have promised."

don quixote thanked him, and ate a little, and sancho a good deal, and
then they both lay down to sleep, leaving those two inseparable friends
and comrades, rocinante and dapple, to their own devices and to feed
unrestrained upon the abundant grass with which the meadow was furnished.
they woke up rather late, mounted once more and resumed their journey,
pushing on to reach an inn which was in sight, apparently a league off. i

and as good fare as they could find in saragossa. they dismounted, and
sancho stowed away his larder in a room of which the landlord gave him
the key. he took the beasts to the stable, fed them, and came back to see
what orders don quixote, who was seated on a bench at the door, had for
him, giving special thanks to heaven that this inn had not been taken for
a castle by his master. supper-time came, and they repaired to their
room, and sancho asked the landlord what he had to give them for supper.
to this the landlord replied that his mouth should be the measure; he had
only to ask what he would; for that inn was provided with the birds of
the air and the fowls of the earth and the fish of the sea.

"there's no need of a

"if you come to people of quality," said sancho, "there's nobody more so
than my master; but the calling he follows does not allow of larders or
store-rooms; we lay ourselves down in the middle of a meadow, and fill
ourselves with acorns or medlars."

here ended sancho's conversation with the landlord, sancho not caring to
carry it any farther by answering him; for he had already asked him what
calling or what profession it was his master was of.

supper-time having come, then, don quixote betook himself to his room,
the landlord brought in the stew-pan just as it was, and he sat himself
down to sup very resolutely. it seems that in another room, which was
next to don quixote's, with nothing but a thin partition to separate it,
he overheard these words, "as you live, senor don jeronimo, while they
are bringing supper, let us read another chapter of the second part of
'don quixote of la mancha.'"

the instant don quixote heard his own name, he started to his feet and

ened with open ears to catch what they said about him, and heard the
don jeronimo who had been addressed say in reply, "why would you have us
read that absurd stuff, don juan, when it is impossible for anyone who
has read the first part of the history of 'don quixote of la mancha' to
take any pleasure in reading this second part?"

"for all that," said he who was addressed as don juan, "we shall do well
to read it, for there is no book so bad but it has something good in it.
what displeases me most in it is that it represents don quixote as now
cured of his love for dulcinea del toboso."

on hearing this don quixote, full of wrath and indignation, lifted up his
voice and said, "whoever he may be who says that don quixote of la mancha
has forgotten

 or can forget dulcinea del toboso, i will teach him with
equal arms that what he says is very far from the truth; for neither can
the peerless dulcinea del toboso be forgotten, nor can forgetfulness have
a place in don quixote; his motto is constancy, and his profession to
maintain the same with his life and never wrong it."

"who is this that answers us?" said they in the next room.

"who should it be," said sancho, "but don quixote of la mancha himself,
who will make good all he has said and all he will say; for pledges don't
trouble a good payer."

sancho had hardly uttered these words when two gentlemen, for such they
seemed to be, entered the room, and one of them, throwing his arms round
don quixote's neck, said to him, "your appearance cannot leave any
question as to your name, nor can your name fail to identify your
appearance; unquestionably, senor, you are the real don quixote of la

the hands of don quixote, who took it, and without replying began to run
his eye over it; but he presently returned it saying, "in the little i
have seen i have discovered three things in this author that deserve to
be censured. the first is some words that i have read in the preface; the
next that the language is aragonese, for sometimes he writes without
articles; and the third, which above all stamps him as ignorant, is that

good reason to fear that he is in error on every other point in the
history."

"a nice sort of historian, indeed!" exclaimed sancho at this; "he must
know a deal about our affairs when he calls my wife teresa panza, mari
gutierrez; take the book again, senor, and see if i am in it and if he
has changed my name."

"from your talk, friend," said don jeronimo, "no doubt you are sancho
panza, senor don quixote's squire."

"yes, i am," said sancho; "and i'm proud of it."

"faith, then," said the gentleman, "this new author does not handle you
with the decency that displays itself in your person; he makes you out a
heavy feeder and a fool, and not in the least droll, and a very different
being from the sancho described in the first part of your master's
history."

"god forgive him," said sancho; "he might have left me in my corner
without troubling his head about me; 'let him who knows how r

the two gentlemen pressed don quixote to come into their room and have
supper with them, as they knew very well there was nothing in that inn
fit for one of his sort. don quixote, who was always polite, yielded to
their request and supped with them. sancho stayed behind with the stew.
and invested with plenary delegated authority seated himself at the head
of the table, and the landlord sat down with him, for he was no less fond
of cow-heel and calves' feet than sancho was.

while at supper don juan asked don quixote what news he had of the lady
dulcinea del toboso, was she married, had she been brought to bed, or was
she with child, or did she in maidenhood, st

firmly rooted than ever, our intercourse unsatisfactory as before, and
her beauty transformed into that of a foul country wench;" and then he
proceeded to give them a full and particular account of the enchantment
of dulcinea, and of what had happened him in the cave of montesinos,
together with what the sage merlin had prescribed for her disenchantment,
namely the scourging of sancho.

exceedingly great was the amusement the two gentlemen derived from
hearing don quixote recount the strange incidents of his history; and if
they were amazed by his absurdities they were equally amazed by the
elegant style in which he delivered them. on the one hand they regarded
him as a man of wit and sense, and on the other he seemed to them a
maundering blockhead, and they could not make up their minds whereabouts
between wisdom and folly they ought to place him.

sancho having finished his supper, and left the landlord in the x
condition, repaired to the room where hi

said, "may i die, sirs, if the author of this book your worships have got
has any mind that we should agree; as he calls me glutton (according to
what your worships say) i wish he may not call me drunkard too."

"but he does," said don jeronimo; "i cannot remember, however, in what
way, though i know his words are offensive, and what is more, lying, as i
can see plainly by the physiognomy of the worthy sancho before me."

"believe me," said sancho, "the sancho and the don quixote of this
history must be different persons from those that appear in the one cide
hamete benengeli wrote, who are ourselves; my master valiant, wise, and
true in love, and i simple, droll, and neither glutton nor drunkard."

"i believe it," said don juan; "and were it possible, an order should be
issued that no one should have the presumption to deal with anything
relating to don quixote, save his original author cide hamete; just as
alexander commanded that no one should presume to pain

"let him who will paint me," said don quixote; "but let him not abuse me;
for patience will often break down when they heap insults upon it."

"none can be offered to senor don quixote," said don juan, "that he
himself will not be able to avenge, if he does not ward it off with the
shield of his patience, which, i take it, is great and strong."

a considerable portion of the night passed in conversation of this sort,
and though don juan wished don quixote to read more of the book to see
what it was all about, he was not to be prevailed upon, saying that he
treated it as read and pronounced it utterly silly; and, if by any chance
it should come to its author's ears that he had it in his hand, he did
not want him to flatter himself with the idea that he had read it; for
our thoughts, and still more our eyes, should keep themselves aloof from
what is obscene and filthy.

they asked him whither he meant to direct his steps. he replied, to

aragossa, to take part in the harness jousts which were held in that
city every year. don juan told him that the new history described how don
quixote, let him be who he might, took part there in a tilting at the
ring, utterly devoid of invention, poor in mottoes, very poor in costume,
though rich in sillinesses.

"for that very reason," said don quixote, "i will not set foot in
saragossa; and by that means i shall expose to the world the lie of this
new history writer, and people will see that i am not the don quixote he
speaks of."

"you will do quite right," said don jeronimo; "and there are other jousts
at barcelona in which senor don quixote may display his prowess."

"that is what i mean to do," said don quixote; "and as it is now time, i
pray your worships to give me leave to retire to bed, and to place and
retain me among the

"and me too," said sancho; "maybe i'll be good for something."

with this they exchanged farewells, and don quixote and sancho retired to
their room, leaving don juan and don jeronimo amazed to see the medley he
made of his good sense and his craziness; and they felt thoroughly
convinced that these, and not those their aragonese author described,
were the genuine don quixote and sancho. don quixote rose betimes, and
bade adieu to his hosts by knocking at the partition of the other room.
sancho paid the landlord magnificently, and recommended him either to say
less about the providing of his inn or to keep it better provided.

quitted the inn, first of all taking care to ascertain the most direct
road to barcelona without touching upon sar

master and man dismounted from their beasts, and as soon as they had
settled themselves at the foot of the trees, sancho, who had had a good
noontide meal that day, let himself, without more ado, pass the gates of
sleep. but don quixote, whom his thoughts, far more than hunger, kept
awake, could not close an eye, and roamed in fancy to and fro through all
sorts of places. at one moment it seemed to him that he was in the cave
of montesinos and saw dulcinea, transformed into a country wench,
skipping and mounting upon her she-ass; again that the words of the sage
merlin were sounding in his ears, setting forth the conditions to be
observed and the exertions to be made for the disenchantment of dulcinea.

point is that he receives them, let them come from whatever quarter they
may?"

with this idea he went over to sancho, having first taken rocinante's
reins and arranged them so as to be able to flog him with them, and began
to untie the points (the common belief is he had but one in front) by
which his breeches were held up; but the instant he approached him sancho
woke up in his full senses and cried out, "what is this? who is touching
me and untrussing me?"

"it is i," said don quixote, "and i come to make good thy shortcomings
and relieve my own distresses; i come to whip thee, sancho, and wipe off
some portion of the debt thou hast undertaken. dulcinea is perishing,
thou art living on regardless, i am dying of hope deferred; therefore
untruss thyself with a good will, for mine it is, here, in this retired
spot, to give thee at least two thousand lashes."

"not a bit of it," said sancho; "let your worship keep quiet, or else by
the living god the deaf shall hear us;

the lashes i pledged myself to
must be voluntary and not forced upon me, and just now i have no fancy to
whip myself; it is enough if i give you my word to flog and flap myself
when i have a mind."

"it will not do to leave it to thy courtesy, sancho," said don quixote,
"for thou art hard of heart and, though a clown, tender of flesh;" and at
the same time he strove and struggled to untie him.

seeing this sancho got up, and grappling with his master he gripped him
with all his might in his arms, giving him a trip with the heel stretched
him on the ground on his back, and pressing his right knee on his chest
held his hands in his own so that he could neither move nor breathe.

"how now, traitor!" exclaimed don quixote. "dost thou revolt against thy

master and natural lord? dost thou rise against him who gives thee his
bread?"

"i neither put down king, nor set up king," said sancho; "i only stand up

and not to offer to whip me now, i'll let you go free and unhindered; if

don quixote gave his promise, and swore by the life of his thoughts not
to touch so much as a hair of his garments, and to leave him entirely
free and to his own discretion to whip himself whenever he pleased.

sancho rose and removed some distance from the spot, but as he was about
to place himself leaning against another tree he felt something touch his
head, and putting up his hands encountered somebody's two feet with shoes
and stockings on them. he trembled with fear and made for another tree,

where the very same thing happened to him, and he fell a-shouting,
calling upon don quixote to come and protect him. don quixote did so, and
asked him what had happened to him, and what he was afraid of. sancho
replied that all the trees were full of men's feet and legs. don quixote
felt them, and guessed at once what it was, and said to sancho, "thou
hast nothing to be afraid of, for these feet and legs that thou feelest
but canst not see belong no doubt to some outlaws and freebooters that
have been hanged on these trees; for the authorities in these parts are
wont to hang them up by twenties and thirties when they catch them;
whereby i conjecture that i must be near barcelona;" and it was, in fact,
as he supposed; with the first light they looked up and saw that

fruit hanging on those trees were freebooters' bodies.

and now day dawned; and if the dead freebooters had scared them, their
hearts were no less troubled by upwards of forty living ones, who all of
a sudden surrounded them, and in the catalan tongue bade them stand and
wait until their captain came up. don quixote was on foot with his horse
unbridled and his lance leaning against a tree, and in short completely
defenceless; he thought it best therefore to fold his arms and bow his
head and reserve himself for a more favourable occasion and opportunity.
the robbers made haste to search dapple, and did not leave him a single
thing of all he carried in the alforjas and in the valise; and lucky it
was for sancho that the duke's crowns and those he brought from home were
in a girdle that he wore round

built, above the middle height, of stern aspect and swarthy complexion.
he was mounted upon a powerful horse, and had on a coat of mail, with
four of the pistols they call petronels in that country at his waist. he
saw that his squires (for so they call those who follow that trade) were
about to rifle sancho panza, but he ordered them to desist and was at
once obeyed, so the girdle escaped. he wondered to see the lance leaning
against the tree, the shield on the ground, and don quixote in armour and
dejected, with the saddest and most melancholy face that sadness itself
could produce; and going up to him he said, "be not so cast down, good
man, for you have not fallen into the hands of any inhuman busiris, but
into roque guinart's, which are more merciful than cruel."

"the cause of my dejection," returned don quixote, "is not that i have
fallen into thy hands, o valiant roque, whose fame is bounded by no
limits on earth, but that my carelessness should have been so g

thy soldiers should have caught me unbridled, when it is my duty,
according to the rule of knight-errantry which i profess, to be always on
the alert and at all times my own sentinel; for let me tell thee, great
roque, had they found me on my horse, with my lance and shield, it would
not have been very easy for them to reduce me to submission, for i am don
quixote of la mancha, he who hath filled the whole world with his
achievements."

roque guinart at once perceived that don quixote's weakness was more akin
to madness than to swagger; and though he had sometimes heard him spoken
of, he never regarded the things attributed to him as true, nor could he
persuade himself that such a humour could become dominant in the heart of
man; he was extremely glad, therefore, to meet him and test at close
quarters what he had heard of him at a distance; so he said to him,
"despair not, valiant knight, nor regard as an untoward fate the position
in which thou findest thyself; it ma

don quixote was about to thank him, when they heard behind them a noise
as of a troop of horses; there was, however, but one, riding on which at
a furious pace came a youth, apparently about twenty years of age, clad
in green damask edged with gold and breeches and a loose frock, with a
hat looped up in the walloon fashion, tight-fitting polished boots, gilt
spurs, dagger and sword, and in his hand a musketoon, and a pair of
pistols at his waist.

and i come to seek from thee a safe-conduct into france, where i have
relatives with whom i can live; and also to implore thee to protect my
father, so that don vicente's numerous kinsmen may not venture to wreak
their lawless vengeance upon him."

roque, filled with admiration at the gallant bearing, high spirit, comely
figure, and adventure of the fair claudia, said to her, "come, senora,
let us go and see if thy enemy is dead; and then we will consider what
will be best for thee." don quixote, who had been listening to what
claudia said and roque guinart said in reply to her, exclaimed, "nobody
need trouble himself with the defence of this lady, for i take it upon
myself. give me my horse and arms, and wait for me here; i will go in
quest of this knight, and dead or alive i will make him keep his word
plighted to so great beauty."

"nobody need have any doubt about that," said sancho, "for my master has
a very happy knack of matchmaking; it's not many days since he forced

would not on any account allow him to accompany her; and thanking him for
his offers as well as she could, took leave of him in tears. the servants
of don vicente carried away his body, and roque returned to his comrades,
and so ended the love of claudia jeronima; but what wonder, when it was
the insuperable and cruel might of jealousy that wove the web of her sad
story?

roque guinart found his squires at the place to which he had ordered
them, and don quixote on rocinante in the midst of them delivering a
harangue to them in which he urged them to give up a mode of life so full
of peril, as well to the soul as to the body; but as most of them were
gascons, rough lawless fellows, his speech did not make much impression
on them. roque on coming up asked sancho if his men had returned and
restored to him the treasures and jewels they had stripped off dapple.
sancho said they had, but that three kerchiefs that were worth three
cities were missing

"what are you talking about, man?" said one of the bystanders; "i have
got them, and they are not worth three reals."

"that is true," said don quixote; "but my squire values them at the rate
he says, as having been given me by the person who gave them."

roque guinart ordered them to be restored at once; and making his men
fall in in line he directed all the clothing, jewellery, and money that
they had taken since the last distribution to be produced; and making a
hasty valuation, and reducing what could not be divided into money, he
made shares for the whole band so equitably and carefully, that in no
case did he exceed or fall short

the roads, to watch who came along them and report what passed to
their chief, came up and said, "senor, there is a great troop of people
not far off coming along the road to barcelona."

to which roque replied, "hast thou made out whether they are of the sort
that are after us, or of the sort we are after?"

"the sort we are after," said the squire.

"well then, away with you all," said roque, "and bring them here to me at
once without letting one of them escape."

they obeyed, and don quixote, sancho, and roque, left by themselves,
waited to see what the squires brought, and while they were waiting roque
said to don quixote, "it must seem a strange sort of life to senor don
quixote, this of ours, strange adventures, strange incidents, and all
full of danger; and i do not wonder that it should seem so, for in truth
i must own there is no mode of life more restless or anxious than ours.

enough to disturb th

together, and i have taken upon myself not only my own but those of
others: it pleases god, however, that, though i see myself in this maze
of entanglements, i do not lose all hope of escaping from it and reaching
a safe port."

don quixote was amazed to hear roque utter such excellent and just
sentiments, for he did not think that among those who followed such
trades as robbing, murdering, and waylaying, there could be anyone
capable of a virtuous thought, and he said in reply, "senor roque, the
beginning of health lies in knowing the disease and in the sick man's
willingness to take the medicines which the physician prescribes; you are
sick, you know what ails you, and heaven, or more properly speaking god,

show you how to become a knight-errant, a calling wherein so many
hardships and mishaps are encountered that if they be taken as penances
they will lodge you in heaven in a trice."

roque laughed at don quixote's exhortation, and changing the conversation
he related the tragic affair of claudia jeronima, at which sancho was
extremely grieved; for he had not found the young woman's beauty,
boldness, and spirit at all amiss.

and now the squires despatched to make the prize came up, bringing with
them two gentlemen on horseback, two pilgrims on foot, and a coach full
of women with some six servants on foot and on horseback in attendance on
them, and a couple of muleteers whom the gentlemen had w

the unlucky wight did not speak so low but that roque overheard him, and
drawing his sword almost split his head in two, saying, "that is the way
i punish impudent saucy fellows." they were all taken aback, and not one
of them dared to utter a word, such deference did they pay him. roque
then withdrew to one side and wrote a letter to a friend of his at
barcelona, telling him that the famous don quixote of la mancha, the
knight-errant of whom there was so much talk, was with him, and was, he
assured him, the drollest and wisest man in the world; and that in four
days from that date, that is to say, on saint john the baptist's day, he
was going to deposit him in full armour mounted on his horse rocinante,
together with his squire sancho on an ass, in the middle of the strand of
the city; and bidding him give notice of this to his friends the niarros,

impossible, because the crazes and shrewd sayings of don quixote and the

men, that they might not know where he was, for the many proclamations
the viceroy of barcelona had issued against his life kept him in fear and
uneasiness, and he did not venture to trust anyone, afraid that even his
own men would kill him or deliver him up to the authorities; of a truth,
a weary miserable life! at length, by unfrequented roads, short cuts, and
secret paths, roque, don quixote, and sancho, together with six squires,
set out for barcelona. they reached the strand on saint john's eve during
the night; and roque, after embracing don quixote and sancho (to whom he
presented the ten crowns he had promised but had not until then given),
left them with many expressions of good-will on both sides.

roque went back, while don quixote remained on horseback, just as he was,
waiting for day, and it was not long before the countenance of the fair
aurora began to show itse

lf at the balconies of the east, gladdening the
grass and flowers, if not the ear, though to gladden that too there came
at the same moment a sound of clarions and drums, and a din of bells, and
a tramp, tramp, and cries of "clear the way there!" of some runners, that
seemed to issue from the city.

the dawn made way for the sun that with a face broader than a buckler
began to rise slowly above the low line of the horizon; don quixote and
sancho gazed all round them; they beheld the sea, a sight until then
unseen by them; it struck them as exceedingly spacious and broad, much
more so than the lakes of ruidera which they had seen in la mancha. they
saw the galleys along the beach, which, lowering their awnings, displayed
themselves decked with streamers and pennons that trembled in the breeze
and kissed and swept the water, while on board the bugles, trumpets, and
clarions were sounding and filling the air far and near
 
 ___________________________
 
and the heavy cannon rent the air with the tremendous noise they made, to
which the gangway guns of the galleys replied. the bright sea, the
smiling earth, the clear air--though at times darkened by the smoke of
the guns--all seemed to fill the whole multitude with unexpected delight.
sancho could not make out how it was that those great masses that moved

and now the horsemen in livery came galloping up with shouts and
outlandish cries and cheers to where don quixote stood amazed and
wondering; and one of them, he to whom roque had sent word, addressing
him exclaimed, "welcome to our city, mirror, beacon, star and cynosure of
all knight-errantry in its widest extent! welcome, i say, valiant don
quixote of la mancha; not the false, the fictitious, the apocryphal, that
these latter days have offered us in lying histories, but the true, the
legitimate, the real one that cide hamete benengeli, flower of
historians, has described to us!"

de no answer, nor did the horsemen wait for one, but
wheeling again with all their followers, they began curvetting round don
quixote, who, turning to sancho, said, "these gentlemen have plainly
recognised us; i will wager they have read our history, and even that
newly printed one by the aragonese."

the cavalier who had addressed don quixote again approached him and said,
"come with us, senor don quixote, for we are all of us your servants and
great friends of roque guinart's;" to which don quixote returned, "if
courtesy breeds courtesy, yours, sir knight, is daughter or very nearly
akin to the great roque's; carry me where you please; i will have no will
but yours, especially if you deign to employ it in your service."

the cavalier replied with words no less polite, and then, all closing in
around him, they set out with him for the city, to the music of the
clarions and the drums. as

the author of all mischief, and the boys who are wickeder than the wicked
one, contrived that a couple of these audacious irrepressible urchins
should force their way through the crowd, and lifting up, one of them
dapple's tail and the other rocinante's, insert a bunch of furze under
each. the poor beasts felt the strange spurs and added to their anguish
by pressing their tails tight, so much so that, cutting a multitude of
capers, they flung their masters to the ground. don quixote, covered with
shame and out of countenance, ran to pluck the plume from his poor jade's
tail, while sancho did the same for dapple. his conductors tried to
punish the audacity of the boys, but there was no possibility of doing
so, for they hid themselves among the hundreds of others that were
following them. don quixote and sancho mounted once more, and with the
same music and acclamations reached their conductor's house, which was
large and stately, that of a rich gentleman, in short; a

trivial matters which cannot be left untold


don quixote's host was one don antonio moreno by name, a gentleman of
wealth and intelligence, and very fond of diverting himself in any fair
and good-natured way; and having don quixote in his house he set about
devising modes of making him exhibit his mad points in some harmless
fashion; for jests that give pain are no jests, and no sport is worth
anything if it hurts another. the first thing he did was to make don
quixote take off his armour, and lead him, in that tight chamois suit we
have already described and depicted more than once, out on a balcony
overhanging one of the chief streets of the city, in full view of the
crowd and of the boys, who gazed at him as the

y would at a monkey. the
cavaliers in livery careered before him again as though it were for him
alone, and not to enliven the festival of the day, that they wore it, and
sancho was in high delight, for it seemed to him that, how he knew not,
he had fallen upon another camacho's wedding, another house like don
diego de miranda's, another castle like the duke's. some of don antonio's
friends dined with him that day, and all showed honour to don quixote and
treated him as a knight-errant, and he becoming puffed up and exalted in
consequence could not contain himself for satisfaction. such were the
drolleries of sancho that all the servants of the house, and all who
heard him, were kept hanging upon his lips. while at table don antonio
said to him, "we hear, worthy sancho, that you are so fond of manjar
blanco and forced-meat balls, that if you have any left, you keep them in
your bosom for the next day."

"no, senor, that's not true,"

 said sancho, "for i am more cleanly than
greedy, and my master don quixote here knows well that we two are used to
live for a week on a handful of acorns or nuts. to be sure, if it so
happens that they offer me a heifer, i run with a halter; i mean, i eat
what i'm given, and make use of opportunities as i find them; but whoever
says that i'm an out-of-the-way eater or not cleanly, let me tell him
that he is wrong; and i'd put it in a different way if i did not respect
the honourable beards that are at the table."

"indeed," said don quixote, "sancho's moderati

arned how to eat daintily, so much so
that he eats grapes, and even pomegranate pips, with a fork."

"what!" said don antonio, "has sancho been a governor?"

"ay," said sancho, "and of an island called barataria. i governed it to
perfection for ten days; and lost my rest all the time; and learned to
look down upon all the governments in the world; i got out of it by
taking to flight, and fell into a pit where i gave myself up for dead,
and out of which i escaped alive by a miracle."

don quixote then gave them a minute account of the whole affair of
sancho's government, with which he greatly amused his hearers.

on the cloth being removed don antonio, taking don quixote by the hand,
passed with him into a distant room in which there was nothing in the way
of furniture except a table, apparently of jasper, resting on a pedestal
of the same, upon which was set up, after the fashion of the busts of the
roman emperors, a head which seemed to be of bronze. don antonio
traversed the 
 
 ___________________________
 
whole apartment with don quixote and walked round the table
several times, and then said, "now, senor don quixote, that i am
satisfied that no one is listening to us, and that the door is shut, i
will tell you of one of the rarest adventures, or more properly speaking
strange things, that can be imagined, on condition that you will keep
what i say to you in the remotest recesses of secrecy."

"i swear it," said don quixote, "and for greater security i will put a
flag-stone over it; for i would have you know, senor don antonio" (he had
by this time learned his name), "that you are addressing one who, though
he has ears to hear, has no tongue to speak; so that you may safely
transfer whatever you have in your bosom into mine, and rely upon it that
you have consigned it to the depths of silence."

"in reliance upon that promise," said don antonio, "i will astonish you
with what you shall see and hear, and re

lieve myself of some of the
vexation it gives me to have no one to whom i can confide my secrets, for
they are not of a sort to be entrusted to everybody."

don quixote was puzzled, wondering what could be the object of such
precautions; whereupon don antonio taking his hand passed it over the
bronze head and the whole table and the pedestal of jasper on which it
stood, and then said, "this head, senor don quixote, has been made and
fabricated by one of the greatest magicians and wizards the world ever
saw, a pole, i believe, by birth, and a pupil of the famous escotillo of
whom such marvellous stories are told. he was here in my house, and for a
consideration of a thousand crowns that i gave him he constructed this
head, which has the property and virtue of answering whatever questions
are put to its ear. he observed the points of the compass, he traced
figures, he studied the stars, he watched f

fridays it is mute, and this being friday we must wait till the next day.
in the interval your worship may consider what you would like to ask it;
and i know by experience that in all its answers it tells the truth."

don quixote was amazed at the virtue and property of the head, and was
inclined to disbelieve don antonio; but seeing what a short time he had
to wait to test the matter, he did not choose to say anything except that
he thanked him for having revealed to him so mighty a secret. they then
quitted the room, don antonio locked the door, and they repaired to the
chamber where the rest of the gentlemen were assembled. in the meantime
sancho had recounted to them several of the adventures and accidents tha

that afternoon they took don quixote out for a stroll, not in his armour
but in street costume, with a surcoat of tawny cloth upon him, that at
that season would have made ice itself sweat. orders were left with the
servants to entertain sancho so as not to let him leave the house. don
quixote was mounted, not on rocinante, but upon a tall mule of easy pace
and handsomely caparisoned. they put the surcoat on him, and on the back,
without his perceiving it, they stitched a parchment on which they wrote
in large letters, "thi

s is don quixote of la mancha." as they set out
upon their excursion the placard attracted the eyes of all who chanced to
see him, and as they read out, "this is don quixote of la mancha," don
quixote was amazed to see how many people gazed at him, called him by his
name, and recognised him, and turning to don antonio, who rode at his
side, he observed to him, "great are the privileges knight-errantry
involves, for it makes him who professes it known and famous in every
region of the earth; see, don antonio, even the very boys of this city
know me without ever having seen me."

"true, senor don quixote," returned don antonio; "for as fire cannot be
hidden

or kept secret, virtue cannot escape being recognised; and that
which is attained by the profession of arms shines distinguished above
all others."

it came to pass, however, that as don quixote was proceeding amid the
acclamations that have been described, a castilian, reading the
inscription on his back, cried out in a loud voice, "the devil take thee
for a don quixote of la mancha! what! art thou here, and not dead of the
countless drubbings that have fallen on thy ribs? thou art mad; and if
thou wert so by thyself, and kept thyself within thy madness, it would
not be so bad; but thou hast the gift of making fools and blockheads of
all who have anything to do with thee or say to thee. why, look at these
gentlemen bearing thee company! get thee home, blockhead, and see after
thy affairs, and thy wife and children, and give over these fooleries
that are

 sapping thy brains and skimming away thy wits."

"go your own way, brother," said don antonio, "and don't offer advice to
those who don't ask you for it. senor don quixote is in his full senses,
and we who bear him company are not fools; virtue is to be honoured
wherever it may be found; go, and bad luck to you, and don't meddle where
you are not wanted."

"by god, your worship is right," replied the castilian; "for to advise
this good man is to kick against the pricks; still for all that it fills
me with pity that the sound wit they say the blockhead has in everything
should dribble away by the channel of his knight-errantry; but may the

a ladies' dancing party, for
don antonio's wife, a lady of rank and gaiety, beauty and wit, had
invited some friends of hers to come and do honour to her guest and amuse
themselves with his strange delusions. several of them came, they supped
sumptuously, the dance began at about ten o'clock. among the ladies were
two of a mischievous and frolicsome turn, and, though perfectly modest,
somewhat free in playing tricks for harmless diversion's sake. these two
were so indefatigable in taking don quixote out to dance that they tired
him down, not only in body but in spirit. it was a sight to see the
figure don quixote made, long, lank, lean, and yellow, his garments
clinging tight to him, ungainly, and above all anything but agile.

the gay ladies made secret love to him, and he on his part secretly
repelled them, but finding himself hard pressed by their blandishments he
lifted up his voice and exclaimed, "fugite, partes adversae! leave me in
peace, unwelcome overtures; avaunt, with yo

 man would rather
undertake to kill a giant than cut a caper. if it had been the shoe-fling
you were at i could take your place, for i can do the shoe-fling like a
gerfalcon; but i'm no good at dancing."

with these and other observations sancho set the whole ball-room
laughing, and then put his master to bed, covering him up well so that he
might sweat out any chill caught after his dancing.

the next day don antonio thought he might as well make trial of the
enchanted head, and with don quixote, sancho, and two others, friends of
his, besides the two ladies that had tired out don quixote at the ball,
who had remained for the night with don antonio's wife, he locked himself
up in the chamber where the head was. he explained to them the property
it possessed and entrusted the secret to them, telling them that now for
the first time he was going to try the virtue of the enchanted head; but
except don antonio's two friends no one else was privy to the mystery of
the enchantment, an

"that's 'what i see with my eyes i point out with my finger,'" said the
gentleman, "so i ask no more."

don antonio's wife came up and said, "i know not what to ask thee, head;
i would only seek to know of thee if i shall have many years of enjoyment
of my good husband;" and the answer she received was, "thou shalt, for
his vigour and his temperate habits promise many years of life, which by
their intemperance others so often cut short."

then don quixote came forward and said, "tell me, thou that answerest,
was that which i describe as having happened to me in the cave of
montesinos the truth or a dream? will sancho's whipping be accomplished
without fail? will the disenchantment of dulcinea be brought about?"

"as to the question of the cave," was the reply, "there is much to be
said; there is something of both in it. sancho's whipping will proceed
leisurely. the disenchantment of dulcinea will attain its due
consummation."

"i seek

to know no more," said don quixote; "let me but see dulcinea
disenchanted, and i will consider that all the good fortune i could wish
for has come upon me all at once."

the last questioner was sancho, and his questions were, "head, shall i by
any chance have another government? shall i ever escape from the hard
life of a squire? shall i get back to see my wife and children?" to which
the answer came, "thou shalt govern in thy house; and if thou returnest
to it thou shalt see thy wife and children; and on ceasing to serv

e thou
shalt cease to be a squire."

"good, by god!" said sancho panza; "i could have told myself that; the
prophet perogrullo could have said no more."

"what answer wouldst thou have, beast?" said don quixote; "is it not
enough that the replies this head has given suit the questions put to
it?"

"yes, it is enough," said sancho; "but i should have liked it to have
made itself plainer and told me more."

the questions and answers came to an end here, but not the wonder with
which all were filled, except don antonio's two friends who were in the
secret. this cide hamete benengeli thought fit to reveal at once, not to
keep the world in suspense, fancying that the head had some strange

, and, being clever, cleverly. cide
hamete adds that this marvellous contrivance stood for some ten or twelve
days; but that, as it became noised abroad through the city that he had
in his house an enchanted head that answered all who asked questions of
it, don antonio, fearing it might come to the ears of the watchful
sentinels of our faith, explained the matter to the inquisitors, who
commanded him to break it up and have done with it, lest the ignorant
vulgar should be scandalised. by don quixote, however, and by sancho the
head was still held to be an enchanted one, and capable of answering
questions, though more to don quixote's satisfaction than sancho's.

the gentlemen of the city, to gratify don antonio and also to do the
honours to don quixote, and give him an opportunity of displaying his
folly, made arrangements for a tilting at the ring in six days from that
time, which, however, for reason that will be mentioned hereafter, did
not take place.

there; the workmen told him, he watched them with wonder, and passed on.
he approached one man, among others, and asked him what he was doing. the
workman replied, "senor, this gentleman here" (pointing to a man of
prepossessing appearance and a certain gravity of look) "has translated
an italian book into our spanish tongue, and i am setting it up in type
for the press."

"what is the title of the book?" asked don quixote; to which the author
replied, "senor, in italian the book is called le bagatelle."

"and what does le bagatelle import in our spanish?" asked don quixote.

"le bagatelle," said the author, "is as though we should say in spanish
los juguetes; but though the book is humble in name it has good solid
matter in it."

you translate su by arriba and giu by abajo."

"i translate them so of course," said the author, "for those are their
proper equivalents."

"i print at my own risk," said the author, "and i expect to make a

thousand copies that will go off in a twinkling at six reals apiece."

"a fine calculation you are making!" said don quixote; "it is plain you
don't know the ins and outs of the printers, and how they play into one
another's hands. i promise you when you find yourself saddled with two
thousand copies you will feel so sore that it will astonish you,
particularly if the book is a little out of the common and not in any way

another case, where he saw them correcting a sheet of a book with the
title of "light of the soul;" noticing it he observed, "books like this,
though there are many of the kind, are the ones that deserve to be
printed, for many are the sinners in these days, and lights unnumbered

that afternoon to see them; and what happened on board of them will be

s a certainty, of
dulcinea's disenchantment. this he turned over in his mind again and
again with great satisfaction, fully persuaded that he would shortly see
its fulfillment; and as for sancho, though, as has been said, he hated
being a governor, still he had a longing to be giving orders and finding
himself obeyed once more; this is the misfortune that being in authority,
even in jest, brings with it.

to resume; that afternoon their host don antonio moreno and his two
friends, with don quixote and sancho, went to the galleys. the commandant
had been already made aware of his good fortune in seeing two such famous
persons as don quixote and sancho, and the instant they came to the shore
all the galleys struck their awnings and the clarions rang out. a skiff
covered with rich carpets and cushions of crimson velvet was immediately
lowered into the water, and as don quixote stepped on board of it, the
leading galley fired her gangway gun, and the other galleys did the same;
and as
 
 ___________________________
 
 he mounted the starboard ladder the whole crew saluted him (as is
the custom when a personage of distinction comes on board a galley) by
exclaiming "hu, hu, hu," three times. the general, for so we shall call
him, a valencian gentleman of rank, gave him his hand and embraced him,
saying, "i shall mark this day with a white stone as one of the happiest
i can expect to enjoy in my lifetime, since i have seen senor don quixote
of la mancha, pattern and image wherein we see contained and condensed
all that is worthy in knight-errantry."

don quixote delighted beyond measure with such a lordly reception,
replied to him in words no less courteous. all then proceeded to the
poop, which was very handsomely decorated, and seated themselves on the
bulwark benches; the boatswain passed along the gangway and piped all
hands to strip, which they did in an instant. sancho, seeing such a
number of men stripped to the sk

right, proceeded to pass him on, whirling him along from hand to hand and
from bench to bench with such rapidity that it took the sight out of poor
sancho's eyes, and he made quite sure that the devils themselves were
flying away with him; nor did they leave off with him until they had sent
him back along the left side and deposited him on the poop; and the poor
fellow was left bruised and breathless and all in a sweat, and unable to
comprehend what it was that had happened to him.

don quixote when he saw sancho's flight without wings asked the general
if this was a usual ceremony with those who came on board the galleys for
the first time; for, if so, as he had no intention of adopting them as a
profession, he had no mind to perform such feats of agility, and if
anyone offered to lay hold of him to whirl him about, he vowed to god he
would kick his soul out; and as he said this he stood up and clapped his
hand upon his sword. at this instant they struck the awning and lowered

the yard with a prodigious rattle. sancho thought heaven was coming off
its hinges and going to fall on his head, and full of terror he ducked it
and buried it between his knees; nor were don quixote's knees altogether
under control, for he too shook a little, squeezed his shoulders together
and lost colour. the crew then hoisted the yard with the same rapidity
and clatter as when they lowered it, all the while keeping silence as
though they had neither voice nor breath. the boatswain gave the signal
to weigh anchor, and leaping upon the middle of the gangway began to lay
on to the shoulders of the crew with his courbash or whip, and to haul
out gradually to sea.

when sancho saw s

o many red feet (for such he took the oars to be) moving
all together, he said to himself, "it's these that are the real chanted
things, and not the ones my master talks of. what can those wretches have
done to be so whipped; and how does that one man who goes along there
whistling dare to whip so many? i declare this is hell, or at least
purgatory!"

don quixote, observing how attentively sancho regarded what was going on,
said to him, "ah, sancho my friend, how quickly and cheaply might you
finish off the disenchantment of dulcinea, if you would strip to the
waist and take your place among those gentlemen! amid the pain and
sufferings of so many you would not feel your own much; and moreover
perhaps the sage merlin would allow each of these lashes, being laid on
with a good hand, to count for ten of those which you must give yourself
at last."

chance they should not be forthcoming. this, then, being agreed upon, the
viceroy landed, and don antonio moreno took the fair morisco and her
father home with him, the viceroy charging him to give them the best
reception and welcome in his power, while on his own part he offered all
that house contained for their entertainment; so great was the good-will
and kindliness the beauty of ana felix had infused into his heart.

the wife of don antonio moreno, so the history says, was extremely happy
to see ana felix in her house. she welcomed her with great kindness,
charmed as well by her beauty as by her intelligence; for in both
respects the fair morisco was richly endowed, and all the people of the
city flocked to see her as though they had been summoned by the ringing
of the bells.

moorish host, as don gaiferos carried off his wife melisendra.

"remember, your worship," observed sancho on hearing him say so, "senor
don gaiferos carried off his wife from the mainland, and took her to
france by land; but in this case, if by chance we carry off don gregorio,
we have no way of bringing him to spain, for there's the sea between."

"there's a remedy for everything except death," said don quixote; "if
they bring the vessel close to the shore we shall be able to get on board
though all the world strive to prevent us."

"your worship hits it off mighty well and mighty easy," said sancho; "but
'it's a long step from saying to doing;' and i hold to the renegade, for
he seems to me an honest good-hearted fellow."

don antonio then said that if the renegade did not prove successful, the
expedient of the great don quixote's expedition to barbary should be
adopted. two days afterwards

 the renegade put to sea in a light vessel of
six oars a-side manned by a stout crew, and two days later the galleys
made sail eastward, the general having begged the viceroy to let him know
all about the release of don gregorio and about ana felix, and the
viceroy promised to do as he requested.

one morning as don quixote went out for a stroll along the beach, arrayed
in full armour (for, as he often said, that was "his only gear, his only
rest the fray," and he never was without it for a moment), he saw coming
towards him a knight, also in full armour, with a shining moon painted on
his shield, who, on approaching sufficiently near to be heard, said in a
loud voice, addressing himself to don quixote, "illustrious knight, and
never sufficiently extolled don quixote of la mancha, i am the knight of

beneficial repose, the same being needful for the increase of thy

head shall be at thy disposal, my arms and horse thy spoils, and the
renown of my deeds transferred and added to thine. consider which will be
thy best course, and give me thy answer speedily, for this day is all the
time i have for the despatch of this business."

don quixote was amazed and astonished, as well at the knight of the white
moon's arrogance, as at his reason for delivering the defiance, and with
calm dignity he answered him, "knight of the white moon, of whose
achievements i have never heard until now, i will venture to swear you
have never seen the illustrious dulcinea; for had you seen her i know you
would have taken care not to venture yourself upon this issue, because
the sight would have removed all doubt from your mind that there ever has

d may not expire; and from your conditions i except only
that of the renown of your achievements being transferred to me, for i
know not of what sort they are nor what they may amount to; i am
satisfied with my own, such as they be. take, therefore, the side of the
field you choose, and i will do the same; and to whom god shall give it
may saint peter add his blessing."

the knight of the white moon had been seen from the city, and it was told
the viceroy how he was in conversation with don quixote. the viceroy,
fancying it must be some fresh adventure got up by don antonio moreno or
some other gentleman of the city, hurried out at once to the beach
accompanied by don antonio and several other gentlemen, just as don
quixote was wheeling rocinante round in order to take up the necessary
distance. the viceroy upon this, seeing that the pair of them were
evidently preparing to come to the charge, put himself between them,
asking them what it was that led them to engage in combat all o

f a sudden
in this way. the knight of the white moon replied that it was a question
of precedence of beauty; and briefly told him what he had said to don
quixote, and how the conditions of the defiance agreed upon on both sides
had been accepted. the viceroy went over to don antonio, and asked in a
low voice did he know who the knight of the white moon was, or was it
some joke they were playing on don quixote. don antonio replied that he
neither knew who he was nor whether the defiance was in joke or in
earnest. this answer left the viceroy in a state of perplexity, not
knowing whether he ought to let the combat go on or not; but unable to
persuade himself that it was anything but a joke he fell back, saying,
"if there be no other way out of it, gallant knights, except to confess
or die, and don quixote is inflexible, and your worship of the white moon
still more so, in god's hand be it, and

fall on."

he of the white moon thanked the viceroy in courteous and well-chosen
words for the permission he gave them, and so did don quixote, who then,
commending himself with all his heart to heaven and to his dulcinea, as
was his custom on the eve of any combat that awaited him, proceeded to
take a little more distance, as he saw his antagonist was doing the same;
then, without blast of trumpet or other warlike instrument to give them
the signal to charge, both at the same instant wheeled their horses; and
he of the white moon, being the swifter, met don quixote after having
traversed two-thirds of the course, and there enc

ountered him with such
violence that, without touching him with his lance (for he held it high,
to all appearance purposely), he hurled don quixote and rocinante to the
earth, a perilous fall. he sprang upon him at once, and placing the lance
over his visor said to him, "you are vanquished, sir knight, nay dead
unless you admit the conditions of our defiance."

don quixote, bruised and stupefied, without raising his visor said in a
weak feeble voice as if he were speaking out of a tomb, "dulcinea del
toboso is the fairest woman in the world, and i the most unfortunate
knight on earth; it is not fitting that this truth should suffer by my
feebleness; drive your lance home, sir knight, and take my life, since
you have taken away my honour."

"that will i not, in sooth," said he of the white moon; "live the fame of
the lady dulcinea's beauty undimmed as ever

; all i require is that the
great don quixote retire to his own home for a year, or for so long a
time as shall by me be enjoined upon him, as we agreed before engaging in
this combat."

the viceroy, don antonio, and several others who were present heard all
this, and heard too how don quixote replied that so long as nothing in
prejudice of dulcinea was demanded of him, he would observe all the rest
like a true and loyal knight. the engagement given, he of the white moon
wheeled about, and making obeisance to the viceroy with a movement of the
head, rode away into the city at a half gallop. the viceroy bade don
antonio hasten after him, and by some means or other find out who he was.
they raised don quixote up and uncovered his face, and found him pale and
bathed with sweat.

e saw the light of the glory of his achievements
obscured; the hopes of the promises lately made him swept away like smoke
before the wind; rocinante, he feared, was crippled for life, and his
master's bones out of joint; for if he were only shaken out of his
madness it would be no small luck. in the end they carried him into the
city in a hand-chair which the viceroy sent for, and thither the viceroy
himself returned, eager to ascertain who this knight of the white moon
was who had left don quixote in such a sad plight.

armour, and he shut himself into a lower ro

of the white moon, seeing then that the gentleman would not leave him,
said, "i know very well, senor, what you have come for; it is to find out
who i am; and as there is no reason why i should conceal it from you,
while my servant here is taking off my armour i will tell you the true
state of the case, without leaving out anything. you must know, senor,
that i am called the bachelor samson carrasco. i am of the same village
as don quixote of la mancha, whose craze and folly make all of us who
know him feel pity for him, and i am one of those who have felt it most;
and persuaded that his chance of recovery lay in quiet and keeping at
home and in his own house, i hit upon a device for keeping him there.
three months ago, therefore, i went out to meet him as a knight-errant,
under the assumed name of the knight of the mirrors, intending to engage
him in combat and overcome him without hurting him, making it the
condition of

i came back conquered, covered with
shame, and sorely bruised by my fall, which was a particularly dangerous
one. but this did not quench my desire to meet him again and overcome
him, as you have seen to-day. and as he is so scrupulous in his
observance of the laws of knight-errantry, he will, no doubt, in order to
keep his word, obey the injunction i have laid upon him. this, senor, is
how the matter stands, and i have nothing more to tell you. i implore of
you not to betray me, or tell don quixote who i am; so that my honest
endeavours may be successful, and that a man of excellent wits--were he
only rid of the fooleries of chivalry--may get them back again."

"o senor," said don antonio, "may god forgive you the wrong you have done
the whole world in trying to bring the most amusing madman in it back to
his senses. do you not see, senor, that the gain by don quixote's sanity
can never equal the enjoyment his crazes give? but my belief is that all
the senor bachelor's pains will

be of no avail to bring a man so
hopelessly cracked to his senses again; and if it were not uncharitable,
i would say may don quixote never be cured, for by his recovery we lose
not only his own drolleries, but his squire sancho panza's too, any one
of which is enough to turn melancholy itself into merriment. however,
i'll hold my peace and say nothing to him, and we'll see whether i am
right in my suspicion that senor carrasco's efforts will be fruitless."

the bachelor replied that at all events the affair promised well, and he
hoped for a happy result from it; and putting his services at don
antonio's commands he t

ook his leave of him; and having had his armour
packed at once upon a mule, he rode away from the city the same day on
the horse he rode to battle, and returned to his own country without
meeting any adventure calling for record in this veracious history.

don antonio reported to the viceroy what carrasco told him, and the
viceroy was not very well pleased to hear it, for with don quixote's
retirement there was an end to the amusement of all who knew anything of
his mad doings.

six days did don quixote keep his bed, dejected, melancholy, moody and
out of sorts, brooding over the unhappy event of his defeat. sancho
strove to comfort him, and among other things he said to him, "hold up
your head, senor, and be of good cheer if you can, and give thanks to
heaven that if you have had a tumble to the ground you have not come off
with a broken rib; and, as you know that 'whe

and give over going about in search of adventures in strange lands and
places; rightly looked at, it is i that am the greater loser, though it
is your worship that has had the worse usage. with the government i gave
up all wish to be a governor again, but i did not give up all longing to
be a count; and that will never come to pass if your worship gives up
becoming a king by renouncing the calling of chivalry; and so my hopes
are going to turn into smoke."

"peace, sancho," said don quixote; "thou seest my suspension and
retirement is not to exceed a year; i shall soon return to my honoured
calling, and i shall not be at a loss for a kingdom to win and a county
to bestow on thee."

"may god hear it and sin be deaf," said sancho; "i have always heard say
that 'a good hope is better than a bad holding."

as they were talking don antonio came in looking extremely pleased and
exclaiming, "reward me for my good news, senor don quixote! don gregorio
and the renegade who went f

or him have come ashore--ashore do i say? they
are by this time in the viceroy's house, and will be here immediately."

don quixote cheered up a little and said, "of a truth i am almost ready
to say i should have been glad had it turned out just the other way, for
it would have obliged me to cross over to barbary, where by the might of
my arm i should have restored to liberty, not only don gregorio, but all
the christian captives there are in barbary. but what am i saying,
miserable being that i am? am i not he that has been conquered? am i not
he that has been overthrown? am i not he who must not take up arms for a

 make."

the viceroy agreed to all that was proposed; but don gregorio on learning
what had passed declared he could not and would not on any account leave
ana felix; however, as it was his purpose to go and see his parents and
devise some way of returning for her, he fell in with the proposed
arrangement. ana felix remained with don antonio's wife, and ricote in
the viceroy's house.

the day for don antonio's departure came; and two days later that for don
quixote's and sancho's, for don quixote's fall did not suffer him to take
the road sooner. there were tears and sighs, swoonings and sobs, at the
parting between don gregorio and ana felix. ricote offered don gregorio a
thousand crowns if he would have them, but he would not take any save
five which don antonio lent him and he promised to repay at the capital.
so the two of them took their departure, and don quixote and sancho
afterwards, as has been already said, don quixote without his armour and
in travelling gear, and sanc

as he left barcelona, don quixote turned gaze upon the spot where he had
fallen. "here troy was," said he; "here my ill-luck, not my cowardice,
robbed me of all the glory i had won; here fortune made me the victim of
her caprices; here the lustre of my achievements was dimmed; here, in a
word, fell my happiness never to rise again."

"senor," said sancho on hearing this, "it is the part of brave hearts to
be patient in adversity just as much as to be glad in prosperity; i judge
by myself, for, if when i was a governor i

 was glad, now that i am a
squire and on foot i am not sad; and i have heard say that she whom
commonly they call fortune is a drunken whimsical jade, and, what is
more, blind, and therefore neither sees what she does, nor knows whom she
casts down or whom she sets up."

"thou art a great philosopher, sancho," said don quixote; "thou speakest
very sensibly; i know not who taught thee. but i can tell thee there is
no such thing as fortune in the world, nor does anything which takes
place there, be it good or bad, come about by chance, but by the special
preordination of heaven; and hence the common saying that 'each of us is
the maker of his own fortune.' i have been that of mine; but not with the
proper amount of prudence, and my self-confidence has therefore made me
pay dearly; for i ought to have reflected t

"senor," returned sancho, "travelling on foot is not such a pleasant
thing that it makes me feel disposed or tempted to make long marches. let
us leave this armour hung up on some tree, instead of some one that has
been hanged; and then with me on dapple's back and my feet off the ground
we will arrange the stages as your worship pleases to measure them out;
but to suppose that i am going to travel on foot, and make long ones, is
to suppose nonsense."

"thou sayest well, sancho," said don quixote; "let my armour be hung up
for a trophy, and under it or round it we will carve on the trees what
was inscribed on the trophy of roland's armour--

these let none move
who dareth not his might with roland prove."

"that's the very thing," said sancho; "and if it was not that we should
feel the want of rocinante on the road, it would be as well to leave him
hung up too."

"and yet, i had rather not have either him or the armour hung up," said
don quixote, "that it may not be said, 'f

f and don't let your
anger break out against the already battered and bloody armour, or the
meekness of rocinante, or the tenderness of my feet, trying to make them
travel more than is reasonable."

in converse of this sort the whole of that day went by, as did the four
succeeding ones, without anything occurring to interrupt their journey,
but on the fifth as they entered a village they found a great number of
people at the door of an inn enjoying themselves, as it was a holiday.
upon don quixote's approach a peasant called out, "one of these two
gentlemen who come here, and who don't know the parties, will tell us
what we ought to do about our wager."

"that i will, certainly," said don quixote, "and according to the rights
of the case, if i can manage to understand it."

"well, here it is, worthy sir," said the peasant; "a man of this village
who is so fat that he weighs twenty stone challenged another, a neighbour
of his, who does not weigh more than nine, to run a race. the
 
 ___________________________
 
 agreement
was that they were to run a distance of a hundred paces with equal
weights; and when the challenger was asked how the weights were to be
equalised he said that the other, as he weighed nine stone, should put
eleven in iron on his back, and that in this way the twenty stone of the
thin man would equal the twenty stone of the fat one."

"not at all," exclaimed sancho at once, before don quixote could answer;
"it's for me, that only a few days ago left off being a governor and a
judge, as all the world knows, to settle these doubtful questions and
give an opinion in disputes of all sorts."

"answer in god's name, sancho my friend," said don quixote, "for i am not
fit to give crumbs to a cat, my wits are so confused and upset."

with this permission sancho said to the peasants who stood clustered
round him, waiting with open mouths for the decision to come from his,
"brothers,

as spoken like a saint, and given judgment
like a canon! but i'll be bound the fat man won't part with an ounce of
his flesh, not to say eleven stone."

"the best plan will be for them not to run," said another, "so that
neither the thin man break down under the weight, nor the fat one strip
himself of his flesh; let half the wager be spent in wine, and let's take
these gentlemen to the tavern where there's the best, and 'over me be the
cloak when it rains."

"i thank you, sirs," said don quixote; "but i cannot stop for an instant,
for sad thoughts and unhappy circumstances force me to seem discourteous
and to travel apace;" and spurring rocinante he pushed on, leaving them
wondering at what they had seen and heard, at his own strange figure and
at the shrewdness of his servant, for such they took sancho to be; and
another of them observed, "if the servant is so clever, what must the
master be? i'll bet, if they are going to salamanca to study, they'll
come to be alcaldes of the

to read and read, and have interest and good luck; and before a man knows
where he is he finds himself with a staff in his hand or a mitre on his
head."

that night master and man passed out in the fields in the open air, and
the next day as they were pursuing their journey they saw coming towards
them a man on foot with alforjas at the neck and a javelin or spiked
staff in his hand, the very cut of a foot courier; who, as soon as he
came close to don quixote, increased his pace and half running came up to
him, and embracing his right thigh, for he could reach no higher,
exclaimed with evident pleasure, "o senor don quixote of la mancha, what
happiness it will be to the heart of my lord the duke when he knows your
worship is coming back to his castle, for he is still there with my lady
the duchess!"

"i do not recognise you, friend," said don quixote, "nor do i know who
you are, unless you tell me."

"i am tosilos, my lord the duke's lacqu

one whom mine enemies the enchanters changed into the lacquey you speak
of in order to rob me of the honour of that battle?"

"nonsense, good sir!" said the messenger; "there was no enchantment or
transformation at all; i entered the lists just as much lacquey tosilos
as i came out of them lacquey tosilos. i thought to marry without
fighting, for the girl had taken my fancy; but my scheme had a very

osilos begged him to explain what had happened him, but sancho replied
that it would not be good manners to leave his master waiting for him;
and that some other day if they met there would be time enough for that;
and then getting up, after shaking his doublet and brushing the crumbs
out of his beard, he drove dapple on before him, and bidding adieu to

if a multitude of reflections used to harass don quixote before he had
been overthrown, a great many more harassed him since his fall. he was
under the shade of a tree, as has been said, and there, like flies on
honey, thoughts came crowding upon him and stinging him. some of them
turned upon the disenchantment of

 dulcinea, others upon the life he was
about to lead in his enforced retirement. sancho came up and spoke in
high praise of the generous disposition of the lacquey tosilos.

"is it possible, sancho," said don quixote, "that thou dost still think
that he yonder is a real lacquey? apparently it has escaped thy memory
that thou hast seen dulcinea turned and transformed into a peasant wench,
and the knight of the mirrors into the bachelor carrasco; all the work of
the enchanters that persecute me. but tell me now, didst thou ask this
tosilos, as thou callest him, what has become of altisidora, did she weep
over my absence, or has she already consigned to oblivion the love
thoughts that used to afflict he

r when i was present?"

"the thoughts that i had," said sancho, "were not such as to leave time
for asking fool's questions. body o' me, senor! is your worship in a
condition now to inquire into other people's thoughts, above all love
thoughts?"

"look ye, sancho," said don quixote, "there is a great difference between
what is done out of love and what is done out of gratitude. a knight may
very possibly be proof against love; but it is impossible, strictly
speaking, for him to be ungrateful. altisidora, to all appearance, loved
me truly; she gave me the three kerchiefs thou knowest of; she wept at my
departure, she cursed me, she abused me, casting shame to the winds she
bewailed herself in public; all signs that she adored me; for the wrath
of lovers always ends

elf that the whipping of my backside has anything to do with the
disenchantment of the enchanted; it is like saying, 'if your head aches
rub ointment on your knees;' at any rate i'll make bold to swear that in
all the histories dealing with knight-errantry that your worship has read
you have never come across anybody disenchanted by whipping; but whether
or no i'll whip myself when i have a fancy for it, and the opportunity
serves for scourging myself comfortably."

"god grant it," said don quixote; "and heaven give thee grace to take it
to heart and own the obligation thou art under to help my lady, who is
thine also, inasmuch as thou art mine."

as they pursued their journey talking in this way they came to the very
same spot where they had been trampled on by the bulls. don quixote
recognised it, and said he to sancho, "this is the meadow where we came
upon those gay shepherdesses and gallant shepherds who were trying to
revive and imitate the pastoral arcadia there, an idea as

e
ourselves famed for ever, not only in this but in ages to come."

"egad," said sancho, "but that sort of life squares, nay corners, with my
notions; and what is more the bachelor samson carrasco and master
nicholas the barber won't have well seen it before they'll want to follow
it and turn shepherds along with us; and god grant it may not come into
the curate's head to join the sheepfold too, he's so jovial and fond of
enjoying himself."

"thou art in the right of it, sancho," said don quixote; "and the
bachelor samson carrasco, if he enters the pastoral fraternity, as no
doubt he will, may call himself the shepherd samsonino, or perhaps the
shepherd carrascon; nicholas the barber may call himself niculoso, as old
boscan formerly was called nemoroso; as for the curate i don't know what
name we can fit to him unless it be something derived from his title, and
we call him the shepherd curiambro. for the shepherdesses whose lovers we
shall be, we can pick names as we would pears;

ve her any but teresona," said sancho, "which will go
well with her stoutness and with her own right name, as she is called
teresa; and then when i sing her praises in my verses i'll show how
chaste my passion is, for i'm not going to look 'for better bread than
ever came from wheat' in other men's houses. it won't do for the curate
to have a shepherdess, for the sake of good example; and if the bachelor
chooses to have one, that is his look-out."

"god bless me, sancho my friend!" said don quixote, "what a life we shall
lead! what hautboys and zamora bagpipes we shall hear, what tabors,
timbrels, and rebecks! and then if among all these different sorts of
music that of the albogues is heard, almost all the pastoral instruments
will be there."

"what are albogues?" asked sancho, "for i never in my life heard tell of
them or saw them."

"albogues," said don quixote, "are brass plates like candlesticks that
struck against one another on the hollow side make a noise which, if not

shepherds there are with more mischief than simplicity in them; i would
not have her 'come for wool and go back shorn;' love-making and lawless

shepherds' shanties as in royal palaces; 'do away with the cause, you do
away with the sin;' 'if eyes don't see hearts don't break' and 'better a
clear escape than good men's prayers.'"

"a truce to thy proverbs, sancho," exclaimed don quixote; "any one of
those thou hast uttered would suffice to explain thy meaning; many a time
have i recommended thee not to be so lavish with proverbs and to exercise
some moderation in delivering them; but it seems to me it is only
'preaching in the desert;' 'my mother beats me and i go on with my
tricks."

"it seems to me," said sancho, "that your worship is like the common
saying, 'said the frying-pan to the kettle, get away, blackbreech.' you

drag them in, rather than introduce them; if i am not mistaken, i have

knight-errantry in woods and forests, even though at times plenty

the wedding of camacho the rich, and at don antonio moreno's; he

awoke sancho and said to him, "i am amazed, sancho, at the unconcern of
thy temperament. i believe thou art made of marble or hard brass,
incapable of any emotion or feeling whatever. i lie awake while thou
sleepest, i weep while thou singest, i am faint with fasting while thou
art sluggish and torpid from pure repletion. it is the duty of good
servants to share the sufferings and feel the sorrows of their masters,
if it be only for the sake

tion, thou thy constancy, making a beginning at once with the
pastoral life we are to follow at our village."

"senor," replied sancho, "i'm no monk to get up out of the middle of my
sleep and scourge myself, nor does it seem to me that one can pass from
one extreme of the pain of whipping to the other of music. will your
worship let me sleep, and not worry me about whipping myself? or you'll
make me swear never to touch a hair of my doublet, not to say my flesh."

"o hard heart!" said don quixote, "o pitiless squire! o bread
ill-bestowed and favours ill-acknowledged, both those i have done thee
and those i mean to do thee! through me hast thou seen thyself a
governor, and through me thou seest thyself in immediate expectation of
being a count, or obtaining some other equivalent title, for i-post
tenebras spero lucem."

"i don't know what that is," said sancho; "all i know is that so long as
i am asleep i have neither fear nor hope, trouble nor glory; and good
luck betide him th

"ha, by my life, master mine," said sancho, "it's not i that am stringing
proverbs now, for they drop in pairs from your worship's mouth faster
than from mine; only there is this difference between mine and yours,
that yours are well-timed and mine are untimely; but anyhow, they are all
proverbs."

at this point they became aware of a harsh indistinct noise that seemed
to spread through all the valleys around. don quixote stood up and laid
his hand upon his sword, and sancho ensconced himself under dapple and
put the bundle of armour on one side of him and the ass's pack-saddle on
the other, in fear and trembling as great as don quixote's perturbation.
each instant the noise increased and came nearer to the two terrified
men, or at least to one, for as to the other, his courage is known to
all. the fact of the matter was that some men were taking above six
hundred pigs to sell at a fair, and were on their

 way with them at that
hour, and so great was the noise they made and their grunting and
blowing, that they deafened the ears of don quixote and sancho panza, and
they could not make out what it was. the wide-spread grunting drove came
on in a surging mass, and without showing any respect for don quixote's
dignity or sancho's, passed right over the pair of them, demolishing
sancho's entrenchments, and not only upsetting don quixote but sweeping
rocinante off his feet into the bargain; and what with the trampling and
the grunting, and the pace at which the unclean beasts went, pack-saddle,
armour, dapple and rocinante were left scattered on the ground and sancho
and don quixote at their wits' end.

sancho got up as well as he could and begged his master to give him his
sword, saying he wanted to kill half a dozen of those dirty unmannerly
pigs, for he had by this time found out that that was what they were.

"let

 them be, my friend," said don quixote; "this insult is the penalty
of my sin; and it is the righteous chastisement of heaven that jackals
should devour a vanquished knight, and wasps sting him and pigs trample
him under foot."

"i suppose it is the chastisement of heaven, too," said sancho, "that
flies should prick the squires of vanquished knights, and lice eat them,
and hunger assail them. if we squires were the sons of the knights we
serve, or their very near relations, it would be no wonder if the penalty

eeds overtook us, even to the fourth generation. but what
have the panzas to do with the quixotes? well, well, let's lie down again
and sleep out what little of the night there's left, and god will send us
dawn and we shall be all right."

"sleep thou, sancho," returned don quixote, "for thou wast born to sleep
as i was born to watch; and during the time it now wants of dawn i will
give a loose rein to my thoughts, and seek a vent for them in a little
madrigal which, unknown to thee, i composed in my head last night."

"i should think," said sancho, "that the thoughts that allow one to make
verses cannot be of great consequence; let your worship string verses as
much as you like and i'll sleep as much as i can;" and forthwith, taking
the space of ground he require

and now daylight came, and the sun smote sancho on the eyes with his
beams. he awoke, roused himself up, shook himself and stretched his lazy
limbs, and seeing the havoc the pigs had made with his stores he cursed
the drove, and more besides. then the pair resumed their journey, and as
evening closed in they saw coming towards them some ten men on horseback
and four or five on foot. don quixote's heart beat quick and sancho's
quailed with fear, for the persons approaching them carried lances and
bucklers, and were in very warlike guise. don quixote turned to sancho
and said, "if i could make use of my weapons, and my promise had not tied
my hands, i would count this host that comes against us but cakes and
fancy bread; but perhaps it may prove something different from what we
apprehend." the men on horseback now came up, and raising their lances
surrounded don quixote in silenc

e, and pointed them at his back and
breast, menacing him with death. one of those on foot, putting his finger
to his lips as a sign to him to be silent, seized rocinante's bridle and
drew him out of the road, and the others driving sancho and dapple before
them, and all maintaining a strange silence, followed in the steps of the
one who led don quixote. the latter two or three times attempted to ask
where they were taking him to and what they wanted, but the instant he
began to open his lips they threatened to close them with the points of
their lances; and sancho fared the same way, for the moment he seemed
about to speak one of those on foot punched him with a goad, and dapple
likewise, as if he too wanted to talk. night set in, they quickened their
pace, and the fears of the two prisoners grew greater, especially as they
heard thems

ye scythians;" "don't
open your eyes, ye murderous polyphemes, ye blood-thirsty lions," and
suchlike names with which their captors harassed the ears of the wretched
master and man. sancho went along saying to himself, "we, tortolites,
barbers, animals! i don't like those names at all; 'it's in a bad wind
our corn is being winnowed;' 'misfortune comes upon us all at once like
sticks on a dog,' and god grant it may be no worse than them that this
unlucky adventure has in store for us."

don quixote rode completely dazed, unable with the aid of all his wits to
make out what could be the meaning of these abusive names they called
them, and the only conclusion he could arrive at was that there was no
good to be hoped for and much evil to be feared. and now, about an hour
after midnight, they reached a castle which don quixote saw at once was
the duke's, where they had been but a short time before. "god bless me!"
said he, as he recognised the mansion, "what does this mean? it is all

ourtesy and politeness in this house; but with the vanquished good turns
into evil, and evil into worse."

they entered the chief court of the castle and found it prepared and
fitted up in a style that added to their amazement and doubled their
fears, as will be seen in the following chapter.

of the strangest and most extraordinary adventure that befell don quixote
in the whole course of this great history


the horsemen dismounted, and, together with the men on foot, without a
moment's delay taking up sancho and don quixote bodily, they carried them
into the court, all round which near a hundred torches fixed in sockets
were burning, besides above five hundred lamps in the corridors, so that
in spite of the night, which was somewhat dark, the want of daylight
could not be perceived. in the middle of the court was a catafalque,
raised about two

sweet-smelling flowers of divers sorts, her hands crossed upon her bosom,
and between them a branch of yellow palm of victory. on one side of the
court was erected a stage, where upon two chairs were seated two persons
who from having crowns on their heads and sceptres in their hands
appeared to be kings of some sort, whether real or mock ones. by the side
of this stage, which was reached by steps, were two other chairs on which
the men carrying the prisoners seated don quixote and sancho, all in
silence, and by signs giving them to understand that they too were to be
silent; which, however, they would have been without any signs, for their
amazement at all they saw held them tongue-tied. and now two persons of
distinction, who were at once recognised by don quixote as his hosts the
duke and duchess, ascended the stage attended by a numerous suite, and
seated themselves on two gorgeous chairs close to the two kings, as they
seemed to be. who would not have been

 amazed at this? nor was this all,
for don quixote had perceived that the dead body on the catafalque was
that of the fair altisidora. as the duke and duchess mounted the stage
don quixote and sancho rose and made them a profound obeisance, which
they returned by bowing their heads slightly. at this moment an official
crossed over, and approaching sancho threw over him a robe of black
buckram painted all over with flames of fire, and taking off his cap put
upon his head a mitre such as those undergoing the sentence of the holy
office wear; and whispered in his ear that he must not open his lips, or
they would put a gag upon him, or take his life. sancho surveyed himself

om head to foot and saw himself all ablaze with flames; but as they did
not burn him, he did not care two farthings for them. he took off the
mitre, and seeing it painted with devils he put it on again, saying to
himself, "well, so far those don't burn me nor do these carry me off."
don quixote surveyed him too, and though fear had got the better of his
faculties, he could not help smiling to see the figure sancho presented.
and now from underneath the catafalque, so it seemed, there rose a low
sweet sound of flutes, which, coming unbroken by human voice (for there
silence itself kept silence), had a soft and languishing effect. then,
beside the pillow of what seemed to be the dead body, suddenly appeared a
fair youth in a roman habit, who, to the accompaniment of a harp which h

no sooner had sancho caught sight of them than, bellowing like a bull, he
exclaimed, "i might let myself be handled by all the world; but allow
duennas to touch me--not a bit of it! scratch my face, as my master was
served in this very castle; run me through the body with burnished
daggers; pinch my arms with red-hot pincers; i'll bear all in patience to
serve these gentlefolk; but i won't let duennas touch me, though the
devil should carry me off!"

here don quixote, too, broke silence, saying to sancho, "have patience,
my son, and gratify these noble persons, and give all thanks to heaven
that it has infused such virtue into thy person, that by its sufferings
thou canst disenchant the enchanted and restore to life the dead."

the duennas were now close to sancho, and he, having become more
tractable and reasonable, settling himself well in his chair presented
his face and beard to the first, who delivered him a smack very stoutly
laid on, and then

ear him fell upon the duennas and the
whole set of his tormentors, exclaiming, "begone, ye ministers of hell;
i'm not made of brass not to feel such out-of-the-way tortures."

at this instant altisidora, who probably was tired of having been so long
lying on her back, turned on her side; seeing which the bystanders cried
out almost with one voice, "altisidora is alive! altisidora lives!"

rhadamanthus bade sancho put away his wrath, as the object they had in
view was now attained. when don quixote saw altisidora move, he went on
his knees to sancho saying to him, "now is the time, son of my bowels,
not to call thee my squire, for thee to give thyself some of those lashes
thou art bound to lay on for the disenchantment of dulcinea. now, i say,
is the time when the virtue that is in thee is ripe, and endowed with
efficacy to work the good that is looked for from thee."

to which sancho made answer, "that's trick upon trick, i think, and not
honey upon pancakes; a nice thing it woul

uch, if i'm to be always made the cow of the wedding for the
cure of other people's ailments. leave me alone; or else by god i'll
fling the whole thing to the dogs, let come what may."

altisidora had by this time sat up on the catafalque, and as she did so
the clarions sounded, accompanied by the flutes, and the voices of all
present exclaiming, "long life to altisidora! long life to altisidora!"
the duke and duchess and the kings minos and rhadamanthus stood up, and
all, together with don quixote and sancho, advanced to receive her and
take her down from the catafalque; and she, making as though she were
recovering from a swoon, bowed her head to the duke and duchess and to
the kings, and looking sideways at don quixote, said to him, "god forgive
thee, insensible knight, for through thy cruelty i have been, to me it
seems, more than a thousand years in the other world; and to thee, the
most compassionate upon earth, i render thanks for the life i am now in
possession of. from thi

hand. the duke bade them take it from him, and give him back his cap and
doublet and remove the flaming robe. sancho begged the duke to let them
leave him the robe and mitre; as he wanted to take them home for a token
and memento of that unexampled adventure. the duchess said they must
leave them with him; for he knew already what a great friend of his she
was. the duke then gave orders that the court should be cleared, and that
all should retire to their chambers, and that don quixote and sancho
should be conducted to their old quarters.

"sleep, sancho my friend," said don quixote, "if the pinprodding and

"no pain came up to the insult of the smacks," said sancho, "for the
simple reason that it was duennas, confound them, that gave them to me;

from misery to those who are miserable when awake."

 this great
history, took this opportunity to record and relate what it was that
induced the duke and duchess to get up the elaborate plot that has been
described. the bachelor samson carrasco, he says, not forgetting how he
as the knight of the mirrors had been vanquished and overthrown by don
quixote, which defeat and overthrow upset all his plans, resolved to try
his hand again, hoping for better luck than he had before; and so, having
learned where don quixote was from the page who brought the letter and
present to sancho's wife, teresa panza, he got himself new armour and
another horse, and put a white moon upon his shield, and to carry his
arms he had a mule led by a peasant, not by tom cecial his former squire
for fear he should be recognised by sancho or don quixote. he came to the
duke's castle, and the duke informed him of the road and route don
quixote had taken with the intention of being present at the jousts at
saragossa. he told him

antment of dulcinea at the expense of
sancho's backside; and finally he gave him an account of the trick sancho
had played upon his master, making him believe that dulcinea was
enchanted and turned into a country wench; and of how the duchess, his
wife, had persuaded sancho that it was he himself who was deceived,
inasmuch as dulcinea was really enchanted; at which the bachelor laughed
not a little, and marvelled as well at the sharpness and simplicity of
sancho as at the length to which don quixote's madness went. the duke
begged of him if he found him (whether he overcame him or not) to return
that way and let him know the result. this the bachelor did; he set out
in quest of don quixote, and not finding him at saragossa, he went on,
and how he fared has been already told. he returned to the duke's castle
and told him all, what the conditions of the combat were, and how don
quixote was now, like a loyal knight-errant, returning to keep his
promise of retiring to his village for a

year, by which time, said the
bachelor, he might perhaps be cured of his madness; for that was the
object that had led him to adopt these disguises, as it was a sad thing
for a gentleman of such good parts as don quixote to be a madman. and so
he took his leave of the duke, and went home to his village to wait there
for don quixote, who was coming after him. thereupon the duke seized the
opportunity of practising this mystification upon him; so much did he
enjoy everything connected with sancho and don quixote. he had the roads
about the castle far and near, everywhere he thought don quixote was
likely to pass on his return, occupied by large numbers of his servants
on foot and on horseback, who were to bring him to the castle, by fair
means or foul, if they met him. they did meet him, and sent word to the

as for the latter, one was sleeping soundly and the other lying awake

with it the desire to rise; for the lazy down was never a delight to don

appearance, huddled himself up and well-nigh covered himself altogether

of the bed, and, after a deep sigh, said to him in a feeble, soft voice,
"when women of rank and modest maidens trample honour under foot, and
give a loose to the tongue that breaks through every impediment,
publishing abroad the inmost secrets of their hearts, they are reduced to
sore extremities. such a one am i, senor don quixote of la mancha,

cruelty with which thou hast treated me, obdurate knight,

t there is another thing that
surprises me too, i mean surprised me then, and that was that no ball
outlasted the first throw or was of any use a second time; and it was
wonderful the constant succession there was of books, new and old. to one
of them, a brand-new, well-bound one, they gave such a stroke that they
knocked the guts out of it and scattered the leaves about. 'look what
book that is,' said one devil to another, and the other replied, 'it is
the "second part of the history of don quixote of la mancha," not by cide
hamete, the original author, but by an aragonese who by his own account
is of tordesillas.' 'out of this with it,' said the first, 'and into the
depths of hell with it out of my sight.' 'is it so bad?' said the other.
'so bad is it,' said the first, 'that if i had set myself deliberately to
make a worse, i could not have done it.' they then went on with their
game, knocking other books about; and i, having heard them mention the
name of don quixote whom i love

altisidora was about to proceed with her complaint against don quixote,
when he said to her, "i have several times told you, senora that it

can only receive gratitude, but no return. i was born to belong to
dulcinea del toboso, and the fates, if there are any, dedicated me to

in my heart is to suppose an impossibility. this frank declaration should
suffice to make you retire within the bounds of your modesty, fo

ve came in, and making a profound obeisance to don
quixote said, "will your worship, sir knight, reckon and retain me in the
number of your most faithful servants, for i have long been a great
admirer of yours, as well because of your fame as because of your
achievements?" "will your worship tell me who you are," replied don
quixote, "so that my courtesy may be answerable to your deserts?" the
young man replied that he was the musician and songster of the night
before. "of a truth," said don quixote, "your worship has a most
excellent voice; but what you sang did not seem to me very much to the
purpose; for what have garcilasso's stanzas to do with the death of this
lady?"

"don't be surprised at that," returned the musician; "for with the callow
poets of our day the way is for every one to write as he pleases and
pilfer where he chooses, whether it be germane to the matter or not, and
now-a-days there is no piece of silliness they can sing or write that is

licence."

don quixote was about to reply, but was prevented by the duke and
duchess, who came in to see him, and with them there followed a long and
delightful conversation, in the course of which sancho said so many droll
and saucy things that he left the duke and duchess wondering not only at
his simplicity but at his sharpness. don quixote begged their permission
to take his departure that same day, inasmuch as for a vanquished knight
like himself it was fitter he should live in a pig-sty than in a royal
palace. they gave it very readily, and the duchess asked him if
altisidora was in his good graces.

he replied, "senora, let me tell your ladyship that this damsel's ailment
comes entirely of idleness, and the cure for it is honest and constant
employment. she herself has told me that lace is worn in hell; and as she

altisidora then, pretending to wipe away her tears with a handkerchief,
made an obeisance to her master and mistress and quitted the room.

"ill luck betide thee, poor damsel," said sancho, "ill luck betide thee!
thou hast fallen in with a soul as dry as a rush and a heart as hard as
oak; had it been me, i'faith 'another cock would have crowed to thee.'"

so the conversation came to an end, and don quixote dressed himself and
dined with the duke and duchess, and set out the same evening.

the vanquished and afflicted don quixote went along very downcast in one
respect and very happy in another. his sadness arose from his defeat, and
his satisfaction from the thought of the virtue that lay in sancho, as
had been proved by the resurrection of altisidora; though it was with

all that's good if they put another patient into my hands, they'll have
to grease them for me before i cure him; for, as they say, 'it's by his
singing the abbot gets his dinner,' and i'm not going to believe that
heaven has bestowed upon me the virtue i have, that i should be dealing
it out to others all for nothing."

"thou art right, sancho my friend," said don quixote, "and altisidora has
behaved very badly in not giving thee the smocks she promised; and
although that virtue of thine is gratis data--as it has cost thee no
study whatever, any more than such study as thy personal sufferings may
be--i can say for myself that if thou wouldst have payment for the lashes
on account of the disenchant of dulcinea, i would have given it to thee
freely ere this. i am not sure, however, whether payment will comport
with the cure, and i would not have the reward

at this proposal sancho opened his eyes and his ears a palm's breadth
wide, and in his heart very readily acquiesced in whipping himself, and
said he to his master, "very well then, senor, i'll hold myself in
readiness to gratify your worship's wishes if i'm to profit by it; for
the love of my wife and children forces me to seem grasping. let your
worship say how much you will pay me for each lash i give myself."

"if sancho," replied don quixote, "i were to requite thee as the
importance and nature of the cure deserves, the treasures of venice, the
mines of potosi, would be insufficient to pay thee. see what thou hast of
mine, and put a price on each lash."

"of them," said sancho, "there are three thousand three hundred and odd;
of these i have given myself five, the rest remain; let the five go for
the odd ones, and let us take the three thousand three hundred, which at

"o blessed sancho! o dear sancho!" said don quixote; "how we shall be
bound to serve thee, dulcinea and i, all the days of our lives that
heaven may grant us! if she returns to her lost shape (and it cannot be
but that she will) her misfortune will have been good fortune, and my
defeat a most happy triumph. but look here, sancho; when wilt thou begin
the scourging? for if thou wilt make short work of it, i will give thee a
hundred reals over and above."

"when?" said sancho; "this night without fail. let your worship order it
so that we

night, longed for by don quixote with the greatest anxiety in the world,
came at last, though it seemed to him that the wheels of apollo's car had
broken down, and that the day was drawing itself out longer than usual,
just as is the case with lovers, who never make the reckoning of their
desires agree with time. they made their way at length in among some
pleasant trees that stood a little distance from the road, and there
vacating rocinante's saddle and dapple's pack-saddle, they stretched
themselves on the green gras

s and made their supper off sancho's stores,
and he making a powerful and flexible whip out of dapple's halter and
headstall retreated about twenty paces from his master among some beech
trees. don quixote seeing him march off with such resolution and spirit,
said to him, "take care, my friend, not to cut thyself to pieces; allow
the lashes to wait for one another, and do not be in so great a hurry as
to run thyself out of breath midway; i mean, do not lay on so strenuously
as to make thy life fail thee before thou hast reached the desired
number; and that thou mayest not lose by a card too much or too little, i
will station myself apart and count on my rosary here the lashes thou
givest t

hyself. may heaven help thee as thy good intention deserves."

"'pledges don't distress a good payer,'" said sancho; "i mean to lay on
in such a way as without killing myself to hurt myself, for in that, no
doubt, lies the essence of this miracle."

he then stripped himself from the waist upwards, and snatching up the
rope he began to lay on and don quixote to count the lashes. he might
have given himself six or eight when he began to think the joke no
trifle, and its price very low; and holding his hand for a moment, he
told his master that he cried off on the score of a blind bargain, for
each of those lashes ought to be paid for at the rate of half a real
instead of a quarter.

"go on, sancho my friend, and be not disheartened," said don quixote;
"for i double the stakes as to price."

"in that case," said sancho, "in god's hand be it

 a thousand lashes; that is
enough for the present; 'for the ass,' to put it in homely phrase, 'bears
the load, but not the overload.'"

"no, no, senor," replied sancho; "it shall never be said of me, 'the
money paid, the arms broken;' go back a little further, your worship, and
let me give myself at any rate a thousand lashes more; for in a couple of
bouts like this we shall have finished off the lot, and there will be
even cloth to spare."

"as thou art in such a willing mood," said don quixote, "may heaven aid
thee; lay on and i'll retire."

sancho returned to his task with so much resolution that he soon had the
bark stripped off several trees, such was the severity with which he
whipped himself; and one time, raising his voice, and giving a beech a
tremendous lash, he cried out, "here dies samson, and all with him!"

at the sound of his piteous cry and of the stroke of the cruel lash, don
quixote ran to him at once, and seizing the twisted halter that served
him for a cou

of thy wife and children; let dulcinea wait for a better opportunity, and
i will content myself with a hope soon to be realised, and have patience
until thou hast gained fresh strength so as to finish off this business
to the satisfaction of everybody."

"as your worship will have it so, senor," said sancho, "so be it; but
throw your cloak over my shoulders, for i'm sweating and i don't want to
take cold; it's a risk that novice disciplinants run."

don quixote obeyed, and stripping himself covered sancho, who slept until
the sun woke him; they then resumed their journey, which for the time
being they brought to an end at a village that lay three leagues farther
on. they dismounted at a hostelry which don quixote recognised as such
and did not take to be a castle with moat, turrets, portcullis, and
drawbridge; for ever since he had been vanquished he talked more
rationally about everything, as will be shown presently. they quartered
him in a ro

the bold guest carried her off from menelaus, and on the other was the
story of dido and aeneas, she on a high tower, as though she were making
signals with a half sheet to her fugitive guest who was out at sea flying
in a frigate or brigantine. he noticed in the two stories that helen did
not go very reluctantly, for she was laughing slyly and roguishly; but
the fair dido was shown dropping tears the size of walnuts from her eyes.
don quixote as he looked at them observed, "those two ladies were very
unfortunate not to have been born in this age, and i unfortunate above
all men not to have been born in theirs. had i fallen in with those
gentlemen, troy would not have been burned or carthage destroyed, for it
would have been only for me to slay paris, and all these misfortunes
would have been avoided."

"i'll lay a bet," said sancho, "that before long there won't be a tavern,
roadside inn, hostelry, or barber's shop where the

painter than painted these."

"thou art right, sancho," said don quixote, "for this painter is like
orbaneja, a painter there was at ubeda, who when they asked him what he
was painting, used to say, 'whatever it may turn out; and if he chanced
to paint a cock he would write under it, 'this is a cock,' for fear they
might think it was a fox. the painter or writer, for it's all the same,
who published the history of this new don quixote that has come out, must
have been one of this sort i think, sancho, for he painted or wrote

replied de donde diere. but, putting this aside, tell me, sancho, hast
thou a mind to have another turn at thyself to-night, and wouldst thou
rather have it indoors or in the open air?"

"egad, senor," said sancho, "for what i'm going to give myself, it comes
all the same to me whether it is in a house or in the fields; still i'd
like it to be among trees; for i think they are company for me and help
me to bear my pain wonderfully."

"and yet it must not be, sancho my friend," said don quixote; "but, to
enable thee to recover strength, we must keep it for our own village; for
at the latest we shall get there the day after tomorrow."

sancho said he might do as he pleased; but that for his own part he would
like to finish off the business quickly before his blood cooled and while
he had an appetite, because "in delay there is apt to be danger" very
often, and "praying to god and plying the hammer," and "one take was
better than two i'll give thee's," and "a sparrow in the hand

vulture on the wing."

"for god's sake, sancho, no more proverbs!" exclaimed don quixote; "it
seems to me thou art becoming sicut erat again; speak in a plain, simple,
straight-forward way, as i have often told thee, and thou wilt find the
good of it."

"i don't know what bad luck it is of mine," said sancho, "but i can't
utter a word without a proverb that is not as good as an argument to my
mind; however, i mean to mend if i can;" and so for the present the
conversation ended.

 don quixote and sancho remained in the village and inn
waiting for night, the one to finish off his task of scourging in the
open country, the other to see it accomplished, for therein lay the
accomplishment of his wishes. meanwhile there arrived at the hostelry a
traveller on horseback with three or four servants, one of whom said to
him who appeared to be the master, "here, senor don alvaro tarfe, your
worship may take your siesta to-day; the quarters seem clean and cool."

when he heard this don

 quixote said to sancho, "look here, sancho; on
turning over the leaves of that book of the second part of my history i
think i came casually upon this name of don alvaro tarfe."

"very likely," said sancho; "we had better let him dismount, and
by-and-by we can ask about it."

the gentleman dismounted, and the landlady gave him a room on the ground
floor opposite don quixote's and adorned with painted serge hangings of
the same sort. the newly arrived gentleman put on a summer coat, and
coming out to the gateway of the hostelry, which was wide and cool,
addressing don quixote, who was pacing up and down there, he asked, "in
what direction is your worship bound, gentle sir?"

"to a village near this which is my own village," replied don quixote;
"and your worship, where are you bound for?"

"i am going to granada, senor," said the gentleman, "to my own coun

try."

"and a goodly country," said don quixote; "but will your worship do me
the favour of telling me your name, for it strikes me it is of more
importance to me to know it than i can tell you."

"my name is don alvaro tarfe," replied the traveller.

to which don quixote returned, "i have no doubt whatever that your
worship is that don alvaro tarfe who appears in print in the second part
of the history of don quixote of la mancha, lately printed and published
by a new author."

"i am the same," replied the gentleman; "and that same don quixote, the
principal personage in the said history, was a very great friend of mine,
and it was i who took him away from home, or at least induced him to come
to some jousts that were to be held at saragossa, whither i was going
myself; indeed, i showed him many kindnesses, and saved him from having
his shoulders touched up by the executioner because of his extreme

rashness."

"tell me, senor don alvaro," said don quixote, "am i at all like that don
quixote you talk of?"

"no indeed," replied the traveller, "not a bit."

"and that don quixote-" said our one, "had he with him a squire called
sancho panza?"

"he had," said don alvaro; "but though he had the name of being very
droll, i never heard him say anything that had any drollery in it."

"that i can well believe," said sancho at this, "for to come out with
drolleries is not in everybody's line; and that sancho your worship
speaks of, gentle sir, must be some great scoundrel, dunderhead, and
thief, all in one; for i am the real sancho panza, and i have more
drolleries t

with me for a year or so, and you will find they fall from me at every

of la mancha, the famous, the valiant, the wise, the lover, the righter
of wrongs, the guardian of minors and orphans, the protector of widows,
the killer of damsels, he who has for his sole mistress the peerless
dulcinea del toboso, is this gentleman before you, my master; all other
don quixotes and all other sancho panzas are dreams and mockeries."

"by god i believe it," said don alvaro; "for you have uttered more
drolleries, my friend, in the few words you have spoken than the other

sancho panza in all i ever heard from him, and they were not a few. he
was more greedy than well-spoken, and more dull than droll; and i am
convinced that the enchanters who persecute don quixote the good have
been trying to persecute me with don quixote the bad. but i don't know
what to say, for i am ready to swear i left him shut up in the casa del
nuncio at toledo, and here another don quixote turns up, though a very
different one from mine."

"i don't know whether i am good," said don quixote, "but i can safely say
i am not 'the bad;' and to prove it, let me tell you, senor don alvaro
tarfe, i have never in my life been in saragossa; so far from that, when
it was told me that this imaginary don quixote had been present at the
jousts in that city, i declined to enter it, in order to drag his
falsehood before the face of the world; and so i went on straight to
barcelona, the treasure-house of courtesy, haven of strangers, asylum of
the poor, home of the valiant, champion of the

of firm friendships, and city unrivalled in site and beauty. and though
the adventures that befell me there are not by any means matters of
enjoyment, but rather of regret, i do not regret them, simply because i

mancha, the one that fame speaks of, and not the unlucky one that has
attempted to usurp my name and deck himself out in my ideas. i entreat
your worship by your devoir as a gentleman to be so good as to make a
declaration before the alcalde of this village that you never in all your
life saw me until now, and that neither am i the don quixote in print in
the second part, nor this sancho panza, my squire, the one your worship
knew."

"that i will do most willingly," replied don a

to find two don quixotes and two sancho panzas at once, as much alike in
name as they differ in demeanour; and again i say and declare that what i
saw i cannot have seen, and that what happened me cannot have happened."

"no doubt your worship is enchanted, like my lady dulcinea del toboso,"
said sancho; "and would to heaven your disenchantment rested on my giving
myself another three thousand and odd lashes like what i'm giving myself
for her, for i'd lay them on without looking for anything."

"i don't unde

replied that it was a long story to tell, but he would tell him if they
happened to be going the same road.

by this dinner-time arrived, and don quixote and don alvaro dined
together. the alcalde of the village came by chance into the inn together
with a notary, and don quixote laid a petition before him, showing that
it was requisite for his rights that don alvaro tarfe, the gentleman
there present, should make a declaration before him that he did not know
don quixote of la mancha, also there present, and that he was not the one
that was in print in a history entitled "second part of don quixote of la
mancha, by one avellaneda of tordesillas." the alcalde finally put it in
legal form, and the declaration was made with all the formalities
required in such cases

, at which don quixote and sancho were in high
delight, as if a declaration of the sort was of any great importance to
them, and as if their words and deeds did not plainly show the difference
between the two don quixotes and the two sanchos. many civilities and
offers of service were exchanged by don alvaro and don quixote, in the
course of which the great manchegan displayed such good taste that he
disabused don alvaro of the error he was under; and he, on his part, felt
convinced he must have been enchanted, now that he had been brought in
contact with two such opposite don quixotes.

evening came, they set out from the village, and after about half a
league two roads branched off, one leading to don quixote's village, the
other the road don alvaro was to follow. in this short interval don
quixote told

 him of his unfortunate defeat, and of dulcinea's enchantment
and the remedy, all which threw don alvaro into fresh amazement, and
embracing don quixote and sancho he went his way, and don quixote went
his. that night he passed among trees again in order to give sancho an
opportunity of working out his penance, which he did in the same fashion
as the night before, at the expense of the bark of the beech trees much
more than of his back, of which he took such good care that the lashes
would not have knocked off a fly had there been one there. the duped don
quixote did not miss a single stroke of the count, and he found that

twenty-nine. the sun apparently had got up early to witness the
sacrifice, and with his light they resumed their journey, discussing the
deception practised on don alvaro, and saying how well done it was to
have taken his declaration before a magistrate in such an unimpeachable
form. that day and night they travelled on, nor did anything worth
mention happen to them, unless it was that in the course of the night sancho
finished off his task, whereat don quixote was beyond measure joyful. he
watched for daylight, to see if along the road he should fall in with his
already disenchanted lady dulcinea; and as he pursued his journey there
was no woman he met that he did not go up to, to see if she was dulcinea
del toboso, as he held it absolutely certain that merlin's promises could
not lie. full of these thoughts and anxieties, they ascended a rising
ground wherefrom they descried their own village, at the sight of which
sancho fell on his knees ex

claiming, "open thine eyes, longed-for home,
and see how thy son sancho panza comes back to thee, if not very rich,
very well whipped! open thine arms and receive, too, thy son don quixote,
who, if he comes vanquished by the arm of another, comes victor over
himself, which, as he himself has told me, is the greatest victory anyone
can desire. i'm bringing back money, for if i was well whipped, i went
mounted like a gentleman."

"have done with these fooleries," said don quixote; "let us push on
straight and get to our own place, where we will give free range to our
fancies, and settle our plans for our future pastoral life."

with this they descended the slope and directed their steps to their
village.

other, "take it easy, periquillo; thou shalt never see it again as long
as thou livest."

don quixote heard this, and said he to sancho, "dost thou not mark,
friend, what that boy said, 'thou shalt never see it again as long as
thou livest'?"

"well," said sancho, "what does it matter if the boy said so?"

"what!" said don quixote, "dost thou not see that, applied to the object
of my desires, the words mean that i am never to see dulcinea more?"

sancho was about to answer, when his attention was diverted by seeing a
hare come flying across the plain pursued by several greyhounds and
sportsmen. in its terror it ran to take shelter and hide itself under
dapple. sancho caught it alive and presented it to don quixote, who was
saying, "malum signum, malum signum! a hare flies, greyhounds chase it,

the two boys who had been quarrelling came over to look at the hare, and
sancho asked one of them what their quarrel was about. he was answered by
the one who had said, "thou shalt never see it again as long as thou
livest," that he had taken a cage full of crickets from the other boy,
and did not mean to give it back to him as long as he lived. sancho took
out four cuartos from his pocket and gave them to the boy for the cage,
which he placed in don quixote's hands, saying, "there, senor! there are
the omens broken and destroyed, and they have no more to do with our
affairs, to my thinking, fool as i am, than with last year's clouds; and
if i remember rightly i have heard the curate of our village say that it
does not become christians or sensible people to give any heed to these
silly things; and even you yourself said the same to me some time ago,
telling me that all christians who minded omens were fools; but there's

the sportsmen came up and asked for their hare, which don quixote gave
them. they then went on, and upon the green at the entrance of the town
they came upon the curate and the bachelor samson carrasco busy with
their breviaries. it should be mentioned that sancho had thrown, by way
of a sumpter-cloth, over dapple and over the bundle of armour, the
buckram robe painted with flames which they had put upon him at the
duke's castle the night altisidora came back to life. he had also fixed
the mitre on dapple's head, the oddest transformation and decoratio

curate and the bachelor, who came towards them with open arms. don
quixote dismounted and received them with a close embrace; and the boys,
who are lynxes that nothing escapes, spied out the ass's mitre and came
running to see it, calling out to one another, "come here, boys, and see
sancho panza's ass figged out finer than mingo, and don quixote's beast
leaner than ever."

so at length, with the boys capering round them, and accompanied by the
curate and the bachelor, they made their entrance into the town, and
proceeded to don quixote's house, at the door of which they found his
housekeeper and niece, whom the news of his arrival had already reached.

her hair all loose and half naked, dragging sanchica her daughter by the

sanchica embraced her father and asked him if he brought her anything,
for she had been looking out for him as for the showers of may; and she
taking hold of him by the girdle on one side, and his wife by the hand,
while the daughter led dapple, they made for their house, leaving don
quixote in his, in the hands of his niece and housekeeper, and in the
company of the curate and the bachelor.

don quixote at once, without any regard to time or season, withdrew in
private with the bachelor and the curate, and in a few words told them of
his defeat, and of the engagement he was under not to quit his village
for a year, which he meant to keep to the letter without departing a
hair's breadth from it, as became a knight-errant bound by scrupulous
good faith and the laws of knight-errantry; and of how he thought of
turning shepherd for that year, and taking his diversion in the solitude
of the

here he could with perfect freedom give range to his
thoughts of love while he followed the virtuous pastoral calling; and he
besought them, if they had not a great deal to do and were not prevented
by more important business, to consent to be his companions, for he would
buy sheep enough to qualify them for shepherds; and the most important
point of the whole affair, he could tell them, was settled, for he had
given them names that would fit them to a t. the curate asked what they
were. don quixote replied that he himself was to be called the shepherd
quixotize and the bachelor the shepherd carrascon, and the curate the
shepherd curambro, and sancho panza the shepherd pancino.

both were astounded at don quixote's new craze; however, lest he should
once more make off out of the village from them in pursuit of his
chivalry, they trusting that in the course of the year he might be cured,
fell in with his new project, applauded his crazy idea as a bright one,
and offered to share the

head, to pass away our time in those secluded regions where we shall be

the name of the shepherdess he means to glorify in his verses, and that
we should not leave a tree, be it ever so hard, without writing up and
carving her name on it, as is the habit and custom of love-smitten
shepherds."

"that's the very thing," said don quixote; "though i am relieved from
looking for the name of an imaginary shepherdess, for there's the
peerless dulcinea del toboso, the glory of these brooksides, the ornament
of these meadows, the mainstay of beauty, the cream of all the graces,
and, in a word, the being to whom all praise is appropriate, be it ever
so hyperbolical."

"very true," said the curate; "but we the others must look about for
accommodating shepherdesses that will answer our purpose one way or
another."

francenia, and if lucia, lucinda, for it all comes to the same thing; and
sancho panza, if he joins this fraternity, may glorify his wife teresa
panza as teresaina."

don quixote laughed at the adaptation of the name, and the curate
bestowed vast praise upon the worthy and honourable resolution he had
made, and again offered to bear him company all the time that he could
spare from his imperative duties. and so they took their leave of him,
recommending and beseeching him to take care of his health and treat
himself to a suitable diet.

it so happened his niece and the housekeeper overheard all the three of
them said; and as soon as they were gone they both of t

confession, be good to the poor, and upon my soul be it if any evil comes

"hold your peace, my daughters," said don quixote; "i know very well what
my duty is; help me to bed, for i don't feel very well; and rest assured
that, knight-errant now or wandering shepherd to be, i shall never fail
to have a care for your interests, as you will see in the end." and the

shine out of all sannazaro had ever written, and had bought with his own
money two famous dogs to guard the flock, one called barcino and the
other butron, which a herdsman of quintanar had sold him.

but for all this don quixote could not shake off his sadness. his friends
called in the doctor, who felt his pulse and was not very well satisfied
with it, and said that in any case it would be well for him to attend to
the health of his soul, as that of his body was in a bad way. don quixote
heard this calmly; but not so his housekeeper, his niece, and his squire,
who fell weeping bitterly, as if they had him lying dead before them. the
doctor's opinion was that melancholy and depression were bringing him to
his en

d. don quixote begged them to leave him to himself, as he had a
wish to sleep a little. they obeyed, and he slept at one stretch, as the
saying is, more than six hours, so that the housekeeper and niece thought
he was going to sleep for ever. but at the end of that time he woke up,
and in a loud voice exclaimed, "blessed be almighty god, who has shown me
such goodness. in truth his mercies are boundless, and the sins of men
can neither limit them nor keep them back!"

the niece listened with attention

 to her uncle's words, and they struck
her as more coherent than what usually fell from him, at least during his
illness, so she asked, "what are you saying, senor? has anything strange
occurred? what mercies or what sins of men are you talking of?"

"the mercies, niece," said don quixote, "are those that god has this
moment shown me, and with him, as i said, my sins are no impediment to
them. my reason is now free and clear, rid of the dark shadows of
ignorance that my unhappy constant study of those detestable books of
chivalry cast over it. now i see through their absurdities and
deceptions, and it only grieves me that this destruction of my illusions
has come so late that it leaves me no time to make some amends by reading
other books that might be a light to my soul.

feel myself at the
point of death, and i would fain meet it in such a way as to show that my
life has not been so ill that i should leave behind me the name of a
madman; for though i have been one, i would not that the fact should be
made plainer at my death. call in to me, my dear, my good friends the
curate, the bachelor samson carrasco, and master nicholas the barber, for
i wish to confess and make my will." but his niece was saved the trouble
by the entrance of the three. the instant don quixote saw them he
exclaimed, "good news for you, good sirs, that i am no longer don quixote
of la mancha, but alonso quixano, whose way of life won for him the name
of good. now am i the enemy of amadis of gaul and of the whole countless
troop of his descendants; odious to me now are all the profane stories of
knight-errantry; now i perceive my folly, and the peril into which
reading them brought me; now, by god's mercy schooled into my right
senses, i loathe them."

when the three heard him

 speak in this way, they had no doubt whatever
that some new craze had taken possession of him; and said samson, "what?
senor don quixote! now that we have intelligence of the lady dulcinea
being disenchanted, are you taking this line; now, just as we are on the
point of becoming shepherds, to pass our lives singing, like princes, are
you thinking of turning hermit? hush, for heaven's sake, be rational and
let's have no more nonsense."

"all that nonsense," said don quixote, "that until now has been a reality
to my hurt, my death will, with heaven's help, turn to my good. i feel,
sirs, that i am rapidly drawing near death; a truce to jesting; let me
have a confessor to confess me, and a notary to make my will; for in
extremities like this, man must not trifle with his soul; and while the
curate is confessing me let some one, i beg, go for the notary."

they looked at one another, wondering at don quixote's words; but, though
uncertain, they were inclined t

bber and shed tears.

the confession over, the curate came out saying, "alonso quixano the good
is indeed dying, and is indeed in his right mind; we may now go in to him
while he makes his will."

this news gave a tremendous impulse to the brimming eyes of the
housekeeper, niece, and sancho panza his good squire, making the tears
burst from their eyes and a host of sighs from their hearts; for of a
truth, as has been said more than once, whether as plain alonso quixano
the good, or as don quixote of la mancha, don quixote was always of a
gentle disposition and kindly in all his ways, and hence he was beloved,
not only by those of his own house, but by all who knew him.

the notary came in with the rest, and as soon as the preamble of the will had
been set out and don quixote had commended his soul to god with all the
devout formalities that are usual, coming to the bequests, he said,
"item, it is my will that, touching certain moneys in the hands of sancho
panza (whom in my madn

disenchanted, as fine as fine can be. if it be that you are dying of
vexation at having been vanquished, lay the blame on me, and say you were
overthrown because i had girthed rocinante badly; besides you must have
seen in your books of chivalry that it is a common thing for knights to
upset one another, and for him who is conquered to-day to be conqueror
tomorrow."

"very true," said samson, "and good sancho panza's view of these cases is
quite right."

"sirs, not so fast," said don quixote, "'in last year's nests there are
no birds this year.' i was mad, now i am in my senses; i was don quixote
of la mancha, i am now, as i said, alonso quixano the good; and may my
repentance and sincerity restore me to the esteem you used to have for
me; and now let master notary proceed.

"item, i leave all my property absolutely to antonia quixana my niece,
here present, after all has been deducted from the most available portion
of it that may be required to satisfy the bequests i have

 are; and
if it should be proved that he does, and if, in spite of this, my niece
insists upon marrying him, and does marry him, then that she shall
forfeit the whole of what i have left her, which my executors shall
devote to works of charity as they please.

"item, i entreat the aforesaid gentlemen my executors, that, if any happy
chance should lead them to discover the author who is said to have
written a history now going about under the title of 'second part of the
achievements of don quixote of la mancha,' they beg of him on my behalf
as earnestly as they can to forgive me for having been, without intending
it, the cause of his writing so many and such monstrous absurdities as he
has written in it; for i am leaving the world with a feeling of
compunction at having provoked him to write them."

with this he closed his will, and a faintness coming over him he
stretched himself out at full length on the bed. all were in a flutter
and made haste to relieve him, and during the t

hree days he lived after
that on which he made his will he fainted away very often. the house was
all in confusion; but still the niece ate and the housekeeper drank and
sancho panza enjoyed himself; for inheriting property wipes out or
softens down in the heir the feeling of grief the dead man might be
expected to leave behind him.

at last don quixote's end came, after he had received all the sacraments,
and had in full and forcible terms expressed his detestation of books of
chivalry. the notary was there at the time, and he said that in no book
of chivalry had he ever read of any knight-errant dying in his bed so
calmly and so like a christian as don quixote, who amid the tears and
lamentations of all present yielded up his spirit, that is to say died.
on perceiving it the curate begged the notary to bear witness that alonso
quixano

 the good, commonly called don quixote of la mancha, had passed
away from this present life, and died naturally; and said he desired this
testimony in order to remove the possibility of any other author save
cide hamete benengeli bringing him to life again falsely and making
interminable stories out of his achievements.

such was the end of the ingenious gentleman of la mancha, whose village
cide hamete would not indicate precisely, in order to leave all the towns
and villages of la mancha to contend among themselves for the
