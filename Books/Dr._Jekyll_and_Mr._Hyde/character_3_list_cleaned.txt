dr.[CHARACTER] - 
 a reputable london doctor and, along with utterson,
formerly one of jekyll's closest friends. as an embodiment of rationalism,
materialism, and skepticism, lanyon serves a foil (a character whose attitudes
or emotions contrast with, and thereby illuminate, those of another
character) for jekyll, who embraces mysticism. his death represents
the more general victory of  supernaturalism over materialism in dr.
jekyll and mr. hyde.
