uide her to a particular person) or howsoever, she came on one stanley 
koteks, who wore wire-rim bifocals, sandals, argyle socks, and at first glance seemed too young to be working here. as it turned out he 
wasn't working, only doodling with a 

 

fat felt pencil this sign: 

"hello there," oedipa said, arrested by this coincidence. on a whim, she added, "kirby sent me," this having been the name on 

the latrine wall. it was supposed to sound conspiratorial, but came out silly. 

"hi," said stanley koteks, deftly sliding the big envelope he'd been doodling on into an open drawer he then closed. 

catching sight of her badge, "you're lost, huh?" 

she knew blunt questions like, what does that symbol mean? would get her nowhere. she said, "i'm a tourist, actually. a 

stockholder." 

"stockholder." he gave her the once-over, hooked with his foot a swivel chair from the next desk and rolled it over for her. 

"sit down. can you really influence policy, or make suggestions they won't just file in th

he'd also said, "in san francisco; there's noneâ€”" and by then knew he'd made a mistake. "he's living somewhere along 
telegraph," he muttered. "i gave you the wrong address." 

she took a chance: "then the waste address isn't good any more." but she'd pronounced it like a word, waste. his 

face congealed, a mask of distrust. "it's w.a.s.t.e., lady," he told her, "an acronym, not 
'waste,' and we had best not go into it any further." 

"i saw it in a ladies' john," she confessed. but stanley koteks was no longer about to be sweet-talked. 
"forget it," he advised; opened a book and proceeded to ignore her. 

 
she in her turn, clearly, was not about to forget it. the envelope she'd seen koteks doodling what she'd begun to think of 
as the "waste symbol" on had come, she bet, from john nefastis. or somebody like him. her suspicions got embellished 
by, of all people, mike fallopian of the peter pinguid society. 

"sure this koteks is part of some underground," he told her a few days later,

metzger, who'd come along to the scope that evening, wanted to argue. "you're so right-wing you're left-wing," he 

protested. "how can you be against a corporation that wants a worker to waive his patent rights. that sounds like the surplus 
value theory to me, fella, and you sound like a marxist." as they got drunker this typical southern california dialogue de-
generated further. oedipa sat alone and gloomy. she'd decided to come tonight to the scope not only because of the 
encounter with stanley koteks, but also because of other revelations; because it seemed that a pattern was beginning to 
emerge, having to do with the mail and how it was delivered. 

there had been the bronze historical marker on the other side of the lake at fangoso lagoons. on this site, it read, in 1853, a

organized his first couriers in the bergamo region around 1290." 

they sat in silence, listening to rain gnaw languidly at the windows and skylights, confronted all at once by the marvellous possibility. 

"has that ever happened before?" she had to ask. 

"an 800-year tradition of postal fraud. not to my knowledge." oedipa told him then all about old mr thoth's signet ring, and 

the symbol she'd caught stanley koteks doodling, and the muted horn drawn in the ladies' room at the scope. 

"whatever it is," he hardly needed to say, "they're apparently still quite active." 

"do we tell the government, or what?" 

"i'm sure they know more than we do." he sounded nervous, or suddenly in retreat. "no, i wouldn't. it isn't our business, is 

it?" 

she asked him then about the initials w.a.s.t.e., but it was somehow too late. she'd lost him. he said no, but so abruptly out of

as station somewhere along a gray stretch of telegraph avenue and found in a phone 

book the address of john nefastis. she then drove to a pseudo-mexican apartment house, looked for his name among the u. s. 
mailboxes, ascended outside steps and walked down a row of draped windows till she found his door. he had a crewcut and the 
same underage look as koteks, but wore a shirt on various polynesian themes and dating from the truman administration. 

introducing herself, she invoked the name of stanley koteks. "he said you could tell me whether or not i'm a 'sensitive'." 
nefastis had been watching on his tv set a bunch of kids dancing some kind of a watusi. "i like to watch young stuff," he 

explained. "there's something about a little chick that age." 

"so does my husband," she said. "i understand." 

john nefastis beamed at her, simpatico, and brought out his machine from a workroom in back. it looked about the way the 
patent had described it. "you know how this works?"
