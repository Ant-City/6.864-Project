"it is true indeed, my dear friend. i cannot yet find a mouth with
which to tell the story."

"your chi is very much awake, my friend. and how is my daughter,
ezinma?"

"she has been very well for some time now. perhaps she has come
to stay."



"i think she has. how old is she now?"

"she is about ten years old."



"i think she will stay. they usually stay if they do not die before
the age of six."

"i pray she stays," said ekwefi with a heavy sigh.

the woman with whom she talked was called chielo. she was the
priestess of agbala, the oracle of the hills and the caves. in
ordinary life chielo was a widow with two children. she was very
friendly with ekwefi and they shared a common shed in the market.
she was particularly fond of ekwefi's only daughter, ezinma,
whom she called "my daughter." quite often she bought beancakes
and gave ekwefi some to take home to ezinma. anyone seeing
chielo in ordinary life would hardly believe she was the same
person who prophesied when the spirit of agbal

nma pointed out.

"no," said ekwefi. "1 shall think of another one with a song. but it
is your turn now."

"once upon a time," ezinma began, "tortoise and cat went to
wrestle against yams—no, that is not the beginning. once upon a
time there was a great famine in the land of animals. everybody
was lean except cat, who was fat and whose body shone as if oil
was rubbed on it…"

she broke off because at that very moment a loud and high-pitched
voice broke the outer silence of the night. it was chielo, the



priestess of agbala, prophesying. there was nothing new in that.
once in a while chielo was possessed by the spirit of her god and
she began to prophesy. but tonight she was addressing her
prophecy and greetings to okonkwo, and so everyone in his family
listened. the folk stories stopped.



"agbala do-o-o-o! agbala ekeneo-o-o-o-o," came the voice like a
sharp knife cutting through the night. "okonkwo! agbala ekme gio-
o-o-o! agbala cholu ifu ada ya ezinmao-o-o-oi"

at the mention of e

zinma's name ekwefi jerked her head sharply
like an animal that had sniffed death in the air. her heart jumped
painfully within her.

the priestess had now reached okonkwo's compound and was
talking with him outside his hut. she was saying again and again
that agbala wanted to see his daughter, ezinma. okonkwo pleaded
with her to come back in the morning because ezinma was now
asleep. but chielo ignored what he was trying to say and went on
shouting that agbala wanted to see his daughter. her voice was as
clear as metal, and okonkwo's women and children heard from
their huts all that she said. okonkwo was still pleading that the girl
had been ill of late and was asleep. ekwefi quickly took her to their
bedroom and placed her on their high bamboo bed.

the priestess screamed. "beware, okonkwo!" she warned.
"beware of exchanging words with agbala. does a man speak
when a god speaks? bewa

kwefi said firmly.

"tufia-al" the priestess cursed, her voice cracking like the angry
bark of thunder in the dry season. "how dare you, woman, to go
before the mighty agbala of your own accord? beware, woman,
lest he strike you in his anger. bring me my daughter."

ekwefi went into her hut and came out again with ezinma.

"come, my daughter," said the priestess. "i shall carry you on my
back. a baby on its mother's back does not know that the way is
long."

ezinma began to cry. she was used to chielo calling her "my
daughter." but it was a different chielo she now saw in the yellow
half-light.

"don't cry, my daughter," said the priestess, "lest agbala be angry
with you."

"don't cry," said ekwefi, "she will bring you back very soon. i
shall give you some fish to eat." she went into the hut again and
brought down the smoke-black basket in which she kept her dried
fish and other ingredients for cooking soup. she broke a piece in
two and gave it to ezinma, who clung to her.



"don't be afra

id," said ekwefi, stroking her head, which was
shaved in places, leaving a regular pattern of hair. they went
outside again. the priestess bent down on one knee and ezinma
climbed on her back, her left palm closed on her fish and her eyes
gleaming with tears.



"agbala do-o-o-o! agbala ekeneo-o-o-o! …" chielo began once
again to chant greetings to her god. she turned round sharply and
walked through okonkwo's hut, bending very low at the eaves.
ezinma was crying loudly now, calling on her mother. the two
voices disappeared into the thick darkness.

a strange and sudden weakness descended on ekwefi as she stood
gazing in the direction of the voices like a hen whose only chick
has been carried away by a kite. ezinma's voice soon faded away
and only chielo was heard moving farther and farther into the

distance.

"why do you stand there as though she had been kidnapped?"
asked okonkwo as he went back to his hut.

"she will bring her back soon," nwoye's mother said.

but ekwefi did not hear these consolations. she stood for a while,
and then, all of a sudden, made up her mind. she hurried through
okonkwo's hut and went outside. "where are you going?" he asked.

"i am following chielo," she replied and disappeared in the
darkness. okonkwo cleared his throat, and brought out his snuff-
bottle from the goatskin bag by his side.

the priestess' voice was already growing faint in the distance.
ekwefi hurried to the main footpath and turned left in the direction
of the voice. her eyes were useless to her in the darkness. but she
picked her way easily on the sandy footpath hedged on either side
by branches and damp leaves. she began to run, holding her





breasts with her hands

 to stop them flapping noisily against her
body. she hit her left foot against an outcropped root, and terror
seized her. it was an ill omen. she ran faster. but chielo's voice
was still a long way away. had she been running too? how could
she go so fast with ezinma on her back? although the night was
cool, ekwefi was beginning to feel hot from her running. she
continually ran into the luxuriant weeds and creepers that walled in
the path. once she tripped up and fell. only then did she realize,
with a start, that chielo had stopped her chanting. her heart beat
violently and she stood still. then chielo's renewed outburst came
from only a few paces ahead. but e

kwefi could not see her. she
shut her eyes for a while and opened them again in an effort to see.
but it was useless. she could not see beyond her nose.

there were no stars in the sky because there was a rain-cloud.
fireflies went about with their tiny green lamps, which only made
the darkness more profound. between chielo's outbursts the night
was alive with the shrill tremor of forest insects woven into the
darkness.

"agbala do-o-o-o!… agbala ekeneo-o-o-o! …" ekwefi trudged
behind, neither getting too near nor keeping too far back. she
thought they must be going towards the sacred cave. now that she
walked slowly she had time to think. what would she do when
they got to the cave? she would not dare to enter. she would wait
at the mouth, all alone in that fearful place. she thought of all the
terrors of the

at the same time the
priestess also said, "life to you, my daughter."

ezinma's voice from the darkness warmed her mother's heart. she
trudged slowly along.

and then the priestess screamed. "somebody is walking behind
me!" she said. "whether you are spirit or man, may agbala shave
your head with a blunt razor! may he twist your neck until you see
your heels!"

ekwefi stood rooted to the spot. one mind said to her: "woman,
go home before agbala does you harm." but she could not. she
stood until chielo had increased the distance between them and she
began to follow again. she had already walked so long that she
began to feel a slight numbness in the limbs and in the head. then
it occurred to her that they could not have been heading for the
cave. they must have bypassed it long ago,- they must be going
towards umuachi, the farthest village in the clan. chielo's voice
now came after long intervals.

it seemed to ekwefi that the night had become a little lighter. the
cloud had lifted and a few

 just
as ekwefi had thought. the priestess was now saluting the village
of umuachi. it was unbelievable, the distance they had covered. as
they emerged into the open village from the narrow forest track the



darkness was softened and it became possible to see the vague
shape of trees. ekwefi screwed her eyes up in an effort to see her
daughter and the priestess, but



whenever she thought she saw their shape it immediately dissolved
like a melting lump of darkness. she walked numbly along.

chielo's voice was now rising continuously, as when she first set
out. ekwefi had a feeling of spacious openness, and she guessed
they must be on the village ilo, or playground. and she realized too
with something like a jerk that chielo was no longer moving
forward. she was, in fact, returning. ekwefi quickly moved away
from her line of retreat. chielo passed by, and they began to go
back the way they had come.

it was a long and weary journey and ekwefi felt like a sleepwalker
most of the way. the m

oon was definitely rising, and although it
had not yet appeared on the sky its light had already melted down
the darkness. ekwefi could now discern the figure of the priestess
and her burden. she slowed down her pace so as to increase the
distance between them. she was afraid of what might happen if
chielo suddenly turned round and saw her.

she had prayed for the moon to rise. but now she found the half-
light of the incipient moon more terrifying than darkness. the
world was now peopled with vague, fantastic figures that dissolved
under her steady gaze and then formed again in new shapes. at one
stage ekwefi was so afraid that she nearly called out to chielo for
companionship and human sympathy. what she had seen was the
shape of a man climbing a palm tree, his head pointing to the earth
and hi

s legs skywards. but at that very moment chielo's voice rose
again in her possessed chanting, and ekwefi recoiled, because
there was no humanity there. it was not the same chielo who sat
with her in the market and sometimes bought beancakes for
ezinma, whom she called her daughter. it was a different




woman—the priestess of agbala, the oracle of the hills and caves.
ekwefi trudged along between two fears. the sound of her
benumbed steps seemed to come from some other person walking
behind her. her arms were folded across her bare breasts. dew fell
heavily and the air was cold. she could no longer think, not even
about the terrors of night. she just jogged along in

 a half-sleep,
only waking to full life when chielo sang.

at last they took a turning and began to head for the caves. from
then on, chielo never ceased in her chanting. she greeted her god
in a multitude of names—the owner of the future, the messenger of
earth, the god who cut a man down when his life was sweetest to
him. ekwefi was also awakened and her benumbed fears revived.

the moon was now up and she could see chielo and ezinma
clearly. how a woman could carry a child of that size so easily and
for so long was a miracle. but ekwefi was not thinking about that.
chielo was not a woman that night.

"agbala do-o-o-o! agbala ekeneo-o-o-o! chi negbu madu ubosi
ndu ya nato ya uto daluo-o-o! …"

ekwefi could already see the hills looming in the moonlight. they
formed a circular ring with a break at one point through which the
foot-track led to the center of the circle.

as soon as the priestess stepped into this

ice, all its
metal taken out of it by the vast emptiness of the cave. she buried
her face in her lap and waited.

she did not know how long she waited. it must have been a very
long time. her back was turned on the footpath that led out of the
hills. she must have heard a noise behind her and turned round
sharply. a man stood there with a machete in his hand. ekwefi
uttered a scream and sprang to her feet.

"don't be foolish," said okonkwo's voice. "1 thought you were
going into the shrine with chielo," he mocked.

ekwefi did not answer. tears of gratitude filled her eyes. she knew
her daughter was safe.

"go home and sleep," said okonkwo. "1 shall wait here."

"i shall wait too. it is almost dawn. the first cock has crowed."

as they stood there together, ekwefi's mind went back to the days
when they were young. she had married anene because okonkwo
was too poor then to marry. two years after her marriage to anene
she could bear it no longer and she ran away to okonkwo. it had
been early in

 hair blended with the smell of cooking. then they
washed them and cut them up for the women who prepared the
soup.

all this anthill activity was going smoothly when a sudden
interruption came. it was a cry in the distance: oji odu aru ijiji-o-o!



(the one that uses its tail to drive flies away!). every woman
immediately abandoned whatever she was doing and rushed out in
the direction of the cry.



"we cannot all rush out like that, leaving what we are cooking to
burn in the fire," shouted chielo, the priestess. "three or four of us
should stay behind."

"it is true," said another woman. "we will allow three or four
women to stay behind."

five women stayed behind to look after the cooking-pots, and all
the rest rushed away to see the cow that had been let loose. when
they saw it they drove it back to its owner, who at once paid the
heavy fine which the village imposed on anyone whose cow was
let loose on his neighbors' crops. when the women had exacted the
penalty they checked among th

surrounding towns and villages. that was a source of great sorrow
to the leaders of the clan, but many of them believed that the
strange faith and the white man's god would not last. none of his
converts was a man whose word was heeded in ihe assembly of the
people. none of them was a man of title. they were mostly the
kind of people that were called efulefu, worthless, empty men. the
imagery of an efulefu in the language of the clan was a man who
sold his machete and wore the sheath to battle. chielo, the priestess
of agbala, called the converts the excrement of the clan, and the
new faith was a mad dog that had come to eat it up.

what moved obierika to visit okonkwo was the sudden
appearance of the latter's son, nwoye, among the missionaries in
umuofia.



"what are you doing here?" obierika had asked when  after many
difficulties the missionaries had allowed him to speak to the boy.



"1 am one of them," replied nwoye.

"how is your father?" obierika asked, not knowing what else to
say
