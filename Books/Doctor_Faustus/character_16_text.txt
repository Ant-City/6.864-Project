     emperor. master doctor faustus,[132] i have heard strange report
     of thy knowledge in the black art, how that none in my empire
     nor in the whole world can compare with thee for the rare effects
     of magic:  they say thou hast a familiar spirit, by whom thou canst
     accomplish what thou list.  this, therefore, is my request, that
     thou let me see some proof of thy skill, that mine eyes may be
     witnesses to confirm what mine ears have heard r

     faustus. my gracious sovereign, though i must confess myself far
     inferior to the report men have published, and nothing answerable
     to the honour of your imperial majesty, yet, for that love and duty
     binds me thereunto, i am content to do whatsoever your majesty
     shall command me.

     thou shalt both satisfy my just desire,

     two deceased princes, which long since are consumed to dust.

     knight. do you hear, master doctor? you bring alexander and his
     paramour before the emperor!

     faustus. how then, sir?

     knight. i'faith, that's as true as diana turned me to a stag.

     faustus. no, sir; but, when actaeon died, he left the horns for
     you.--mephistophilis, be gone.

     emperor. sure, these are no spirits, but the true substantial

     you remembered how you crossed me in my conference with the
     emperor?  i think i have met with you for it.

     emperor. good master doctor, at my entreaty release him:  he hath
     done penance sufficient.

     faustus. my gracious lord, not so much for the injury he offered
     me here in your presence, as to delight you with some mirth, hath
     faustus worthily requited this injurious knight; which being all
     i desire, i am content to release him of his horns:--and,
     sir knight, hereafter speak well of scholars.--mephistophilis,
