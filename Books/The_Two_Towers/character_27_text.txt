ince his last coming in the summer all things have gone amiss. at that time our trouble with saruman began. until then we counted saruman our friend, hut gandalf came then and warned us that sudden war was preparing in isengard. he said that he himself had been a prisoner in orthanc and had hardly escaped, and he begged for help. but théoden would not listen to him, and he went away. speak not the name of gandalf loudly in théoden's ears! he is wroth. for gandalf took the horse that is called shadowfax, the most precious of all the king's steeds, chief of the mearas, which only the lord of the mark may ride. for the sire of their race was the great horse of eorl that knew the speech of men. seven nights ago shadowfax returned; but the king's anger is not less, for now the horse is wild and will let no man handle him.'
'then shadowfax has found his way alone from the far north,' said aragorn; 'for it was there that he and gandalf parted. but alas! gandalf will ride no longer. he fell into dark

hair. they were hemming the orcs in, preventing them from scattering, and driving them along the line of the river.
he wondered very much what kind of folk they were. he wished now that he had learned more in rivendell, and looked more at maps and things; but in those days the plans for the journey seemed to be in more competent hands, and he had never reckoned with being cut off from gandalf, or from strider, and even from frodo. all that he could remember about rohan was that gandalf's horse, shadowfax, had come from that land. that sounded hopeful, as far as it went.
'but how will they know that we are not orcs?' he thought. 'i don't suppose they've ever heard of hobbits down here. i suppose i ought to be glad that the beastly orcs look like being destroyed, but i would rather be saved myself.' the chances were that he and merry would be killed together with their captors, before ever the men of rohan were aware of them.

tible only to aragorn as he lay upon the grass, then growing steadily louder and clearer to a quick beat.
'there is more than one horse coming,' said aragorn.
'certainly,' said gandalf. 'we are too great a burden for one.'
'there are three,' said legolas, gazing out over the plain. 'see how they run! there is hasufel, and there is my friend arod beside him! but there is another that strides ahead: a very great horse. i have not seen his like before.'
'nor will you again,' said gandalf. 'that is shadowfax. he is the chief of the mearas, lords of horses, and not even théoden, king of rohan, has ever looked on a better. does he not shine like silver, and run as smoothly as a swift stream? he has come for me: the horse of the white rider. we are going to battle together.'
even as the old wizard spoke, the great horse came striding up the slope towards them; his coat was glistening and his mane flowing in the wind of his speed. the two others followed, now far behind. as soon as shadowfax saw ganda

soon the other horses came up and stood quietly by, as if awaiting orders. 'we go at once to meduseld, the hall of your master, théoden,' said gandalf, addressing them gravely. they bowed their heads. 'time presses, so with your leave, my friends, we will ride. we beg you to use all the speed that you can. hasufel shall bear aragorn and arod legolas. i will set gimli before me, and by his leave shadowfax shall bear us both. we will wait now only to drink a little.'
'now i understand a part of last night's riddle,' said legolas as he sprang lightly upon arod's back. 'whether they fled at first in fear, or not, our horses met shadowfax, their chieftain, and greeted him with joy. did you know that he was at hand, gandalf?'
'yes, i knew,' said the wizard. 'i bent my thought upon him, bidding him to make haste; for yesterday he was far away in the south of this land. swiftly may he bear me back agai

n!'
gandalf spoke now to shadowfax, and the horse set off at a good pace, yet not beyond the measure of the others. after a little while he turned suddenly, and choosing a place where the banks were lower, he waded the river, and then led them away due south into a flat land, treeless and wide. the wind went like grey waves through the endless miles of grass. there was no sign of road or track, but shadowfax did not stay or falter.
'he is steering a straight course now for the halls of théoden under the slopes of the white mountains,' said gandalf. 'it will be quicker so. the ground is firmer in the eastemnet, where the chief northward track lies, across the river, but shadowfax knows the way through every fen and hollow.'
for many hours they rode on through the meads and riverlands. often the grass was so high that it reached above the knees of the riders, and their steeds seemed to be swimming i

n a grey-green sea. they came upon many hidden pools, and broad acres of sedge waving above wet and treacherous bogs; but shadowfax found the way, and the other horses followed in his swath. slowly the sun fell from the sky down into the west. looking out over the great plain, far away the riders saw it for a moment like a red fire sinking into the grass. low upon the edge of sight shoulders of the mountains glinted red upon either side. a smoke seemed to rise up and darken the sun's disc to the hue of blood, as if it had kindled the grass as it passed down under the rim of earth.
'there lies the gap of rohan,' said gandalf

at, if gandalf had not clutched and shaken him. hasufel and arod, weary but proud, followed their tireless leader, a grey shadow before them hardly to he seen. the miles went by. the waxing moon sank into the cloudy west.
a bitter chill came into the air. slowly in the east the dark faded to a cold grey. red shafts of light leapt above the black walls of the emyn muil far away upon their left. dawn came clear and bright; a wind swept across their path, rushing through the bent grasses. suddenly shadowfax stood still and neighed. gandalf pointed ahead.
'look!' he cried, and they lifted their tired eyes. before them stood the mountains of the south: white-tipped and streaked with black. the grass-lands rolled against the hills that clustered at their feet, and flowed up into many valleys still dim and dark, untouched by the light of dawn, winding their way into the heart of the great mountains. immediately before the travellers the widest of these glens opened like a long gulf among the hills. fa

'yes, i will go,' he answered slowly. 'but what names shall i report? and what shall i say of you? old and weary you seem now, and yet you are fell and grim beneath, i deem'
'well do you see and speak,' said the wizard. 'for i am gandalf. i have returned. and behold! i too bring back a horse. here is shadowfax the great, whom no other hand can tame. and here beside me is aragorn son of arathorn, the heir of kings, and it is to mundburg that he goes. here also are legolas the elf and gimli the dwarf, our comrades. go now and say to your master that we are at his gates and would have speech with him, if he will permit us to come into his hall.'

slowly the old man rose to his feet, leaning heavily upon a short black staff with a handle of white bone; and now the strangers saw that, bent though he was, he was still tall and must in youth have been high and proud indeed.
'i greet you,' he said, 'and maybe you look for welcome. but truth to tell your welcome is doubtful here, master gandalf. you have ever been a herald of woe. troubles follow you like crows, and ever the oftener the worse. i will not deceive you: when i heard that shadowfax had come back riderless, i rejoiced at the return of the horse, but still more at the lack of the rider; and when éomer brought the tidings that you had gone at last to your long home, i did not mourn. but news from afar is seldom sooth. here you come again! and with you come evils worse than before, as might be expected. why should i welcome you, gandalf stormcrow? tell me that.' slowly he sat down again in his chair.

lie may be a worker of evil; or he may be such as leaves well alone, and comes only to bring aid in time of need.'
'that is so,' said wormtongue; 'but there is a third kind: pickers of bones, meddlers in other men's sorrows, carrion-fowl that grow fat on war. what aid have you ever brought, stormcrow? and what aid do you bring now? it was aid from us that you sought last time that you were here. then my lord bade you choose any horse that you would and be gone; and to the wonder of all you took shadowfax in your insolence. my lord was sorely grieved; yet to some it seemed that to speed you from the land the price was not too great. i guess that it is likely to turn out the same once more: you will seek aid rather than render it. do you bring men? do you bring horses, swords, spears? that i would call aid; that is our present need. but who are these that follow at your tail? three ragged wanderers in grey, and you yourself the most beggar-like of the four!'

'indeed my eyes were almost blind,' said théoden. 'most of all i owe to you, my guest. once again you have come in time. i would give you a gift ere we go, at your own choosing. you have only to name aught that is mine. i reserve now only my sword!'
'whether i came in time or not is yet to be seen,' said gandalf. 'but as for your gift, lord, i will choose one that will fit my need: swift and sure. give me shadowfax! he was only lent before, if loan we may call it. but now shall ride him into great hazard, setting silver against black: i would not risk anything that is not my own. and already there is a bond of love between us.'
'you choose well,' said théoden; 'and i give him now gladly. yet it is a great gift. there is none like to shadowfax. in him one of the mighty steeds of old has returned. none such shall return again. and to you my other guests i will offer such things as may be found in my armour

'men need many words before deeds. my axe is restless in my hands. though i doubt not that these rohirrim are fell-handed when they come to it. nonetheless this is not the warfare that suits me. how shall i come to the battle? i wish i could walk and not bump like a sack at gandalf's saddlebow.'
'a safer seat than many, i guess,' said legolas. 'yet doubtless gandalf will gladly put you down on your feet when blows begin; or shadowfax himself. an axe is no weapon for a rider.'
'and a dwarf is no horseman. it is orc-necks i would hew, not shave the scalps of men,' said gimli, patting the haft of his axe.
at the gate they found a great host of men, old and young, all ready in the saddle. more than a thousand were there mustered. their spears were like a springing wood. loudly and joyously they shouted as théoden came forth. some held in readiness the king's horse, snowmane, and others held the horses of aragorn and legolas. g

'i thank you indeed,' said gimli greatly pleased. 'i will gladly go with you, if legolas, my comrade, may ride beside us.'
'it shall he so,' said éomer. 'legolas upon my left, and aragorn upon my right, and none will dare to stand before us!'
'where is shadowfax?' said gandalf.
'running wild over the grass,' they answered. 'he will let no man handle him. there he goes, away down by the ford, like a shadow among the willows.'
gandalf whistled and called aloud the horse's name, and far away he tossed his head and neighed, and turning sped towards the host like an arrow.
'were the breath of the west wind to take a body visible, even so would it appear,' said éomer, as the great horse ran up, until he stood before the wizard.

'i thank you, théoden king,' said gandalf. then suddenly he threw back his grey cloak, and cast aside his hat, and leaped to horseback. he wore no helm nor mail. his snowy hair flew free in the wind, his white robes shone dazzling in the sun.
'behold the white rider!' cried aragorn, and all took up the words.
'our king and the white rider!' they shouted. 'forth eorlingas!'
the trumpets sounded. the horses reared and neighed. spear clashed on shield. then the king raised his

while théoden was speaking, gandalf rode a short way ahead, and he sat there alone, gazing north to isengard and west to the setting sun. now he came back.
'ride, théoden!' he said. 'ride to helm's deep! go not to the fords of isen, and do not tarry in the plain! i must leave you for a while. shadowfax must bear me now on a swift errand.' turning to aragorn and éomer and the men of the king's household, he cried: 'keep well the lord of the mark, till i return. await me at helm's gate! farewell!'
he spoke a word to shadowfax, and like an arrow from the bow the great horse sprang away. even as they looked he was gone: a flash of silver in the sunset, a wind over the grass, a shadow that fled and passed from sight. snowmane snorted and reared, eager to follow; but only a swift bird on the wing

'erkenbrand!' the riders shouted. 'erkenbrand!'
'behold the white rider!' cried aragorn. 'gandalf is come again!'
'mithrandir, mithrandir!' said legolas. 'this is wizardry indeed! come! i would look on this forest, ere the spell changes.'
the hosts of isengard roared, swaying this way and that, turning from fear to fear. again the horn sounded from the tower. down through the breach of the dike charged the king's company. down from the hills leaped erkenbrand, lord of westfold. down leaped shadowfax, like a deer that runs surefooted in the mountains. the white rider was upon them, and the terror of his coming filled the enemy with madness. the wild men fell on their faces before him. the orcs reeled and screamed and cast aside both sword and spear. like a black smoke driven by a mounting wind they fled. wailing they passed under the waiting shadow of the trees; and from that shadow none ever came again.

ought strange tidings.' he turned and gazed in wonder, first at the wood and then at gandalf. 'once more you come in the hour of need, unlooked-for,' he said.
'unlooked-for?' said gandalf. 'i said that i would return and meet you here.'
'but you did not name the hour, nor foretell the manner of your coming. strange help you bring. you are mighty in wizardry, gandalf the white!'
'that may be. but if so, i have not shown it yet. i have but given good counsel in peril, and made use of the speed of shadowfax. your own valour has done more, and the stout legs of the westfold-men marching through the night.'
then they all gazed at gandalf with still greater wonder. some glanced darkly at the wood, and passed their hands over their brows, as if they thought their eyes saw otherwise than his.
gandalf laughed long and merrily. 'the trees?' he said. 'nay, i see the wood as plainly as do you. but that is no deed of mine. it is a thing beyond the counsel of the wise. better than my design, and better even

. 'must we pass this way, where the carrion-beasts devour so many good riders of the mark?'
'this is our way,' said gandalf. 'grievous is the fall of your men; but you shall see that at least the wolves of the mountains do not devour them. it is with their friends, the orcs, that they hold their feast: such indeed is the friendship of their kind. come!'
they rode down to the river, and as they came the wolves ceased their howling and slunk away. fear fell on them seeing gandalf in the moon, and shadowfax his horse shining like silver. the riders passed over to the islet, and glittering eyes watched them wanly from the shadows of the banks.
'look!' said gandalf. 'friends have laboured here.'
and they saw that in the midst of the eyot a mound was piled, ringed with stones, and set about with many spears.
'here lie all the men of the mark that fell near this place,' said gandalf.
'here let them rest!' said éomer. 'and when their spears have rotted and rusted, long still may their mound stand and

'is this your work also, gandalf, my friend?' said théoden. 'you accomplished much in an evening and a night!'
'with the help of shadowfax - and others,' said gandalf. 'i rode fast and far. but here beside the mound i will say this for your comfort: many fell in the battles of the fords, but fewer than rumour made them. more were scattered than were slain; i gathered together all that i could find. some men i sent with grimbold of westfold to join erkenbrand. some i set to make this burial. they have now followed your marshal, elfhelm. i sent him with many riders to edoras. saruman i knew had despatched his full strength against y

st winged shape passed over the moon like a black cloud. it wheeled and went north, flying at a speed greater than any wind of middle-earth. the stars fainted before it. it was gone.
they stood up, rigid as stones. gandalf was gazing up, his arms out and downwards, stiff, his hands clenched.
'nazgûl!' he cried. 'the messenger of mordor. the storm is coming. the nazgûl have crossed the river! ride, ride! wait not for the dawn! let not the swift wait for the slow! ride!'
he sprang away, calling shadowfax as he ran. aragorn followed him. going to pippin, gandalf picked him up in his arms. 'you shall come with me this time,' he said. 'shadowfax shall show you his paces.' then he ran to the place where he had slept. shadowfax stood there already. slinging the small bag which was all his luggage across his shoulders, the wizard leapt upon the horse's back. aragorn lifted pippin and set him in gandalf's arms, ,wrapped in cloak and blanket.
'farewell! follow fast!' cried gandalf. 'away, shadowfax!'

o aragorn. 'some folk have wonderful luck. he did not want to sleep, and he wanted to ride with gandalf - and there he goes! instead of being turned into a stone himself to stand here for ever as a warning.'
'if you had been the first to lift the orthanc-stone, and not he, how would it be now?' said aragorn. 'you might have done worse. who can say? but now it is your luck to come with me, i fear. at once. go and get ready, and bring anything that pippin left behind. make haste!'
over the plains shadowfax was flying, needing no urging and no guidance. less than an hour had passed, and they had reached the fords of isen and crossed them. the mound of the riders and its cold spears lay grey behind them.
pippin was recovering. he was warm, but the wind in his face was keen and refreshing. he was with gandalf. the horror of the stone and of the hideous shadow over the moon was fading, things left behind in the mists of the mountains or in a passing dream. he drew a deep breath.

'how fast is he going?' asked pippin. 'fast by the wind, but very smooth. and how light his footfalls are!'
'he is running now as fast as the swiftest horse could gallop,' answered gandalf; 'but that is not fast for him. the land is rising a little here, and is more broken than it was beyond the river. but see how the white mountain

pippin made no answer, but clutched his cloak, as if a sudden chill had struck him. grey land passed under them.
'see now!' said gandalf. 'the westfold dales are opening before us. here we come back to the eastward road. the dark shadow yonder is the mouth of the deeping-coomb. that way lies aglarond and the glittering caves. do not ask me about them. ask gimli, if you meet again, and for the first time you may get an answer longer than yo

'i thought you were going to stop at helm's deep!' said pippin. 'where are you going then?'
'to minas tirith, before the seas of war surround it.'
'oh! and how far is that?'
'leagues upon leagues,' answered gandalf. 'thrice as far as the dwellings of king théoden, and they are more than a hundred miles east from here, as the messengers of mordor fly. shadowfax must run a longer road. which will prove the swifter?
'we shall ride now till daybreak, and that is some hours away. then even shadowfax must rest, in some hollow of the hills: at edoras, i hope. sleep, if you can! you may see the first glimmer of dawn upon the golden roof of the house of eorl. and in two days thence you shall see the purple shadow of mount mindolluin and the walls of the tower of denethor white in the morning.

shadowfax tossed his head and cried aloud, as if a trumpet had summoned him to battle. then he sprang forward. fire flew from his feet; night rushed over him.
as he fell slowly into sleep, pippin had a strange feeling: he and gandalf were still as stone, seated upon the statue of a running horse, while the world rolled away beneath his feet with a great noise of wind.
