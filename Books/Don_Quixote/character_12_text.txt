"heaven grant it, husband," said she, "for indeed we have need of it. but
tell me, what's this about islands, for i don't understand it?"

"honey is not for the mouth of the ass," returned sancho; "all in good
time thou shalt see, wife--nay, thou wilt be surprised to hear thyself
called 'your ladyship' by all thy vassals."

"what are you talking about, sancho, with your ladyships, islands, and
vassals?" returned teresa panza--for so sancho's wife was called, though
they were not relations, for in la mancha it is customary for wives to
take their husbands' surnames.

"don't be in such a hurry to know all this, teresa," said sancho; "it is
enough that i am telling you the truth, so shut your mouth. but i may
tell you this much by the way, that there is nothing in the world more
delightful than to be a person of consideration, squire to a
knight-errant, and a seeker of adventures. to be sure most of those one

the translator of this history, when he comes to write this fifth
chapter, says that he considers it apocryphal, because in it sancho panza
speaks in a style unlike that which might have been expected from his
limited intelligence, and says things so subtle that he does not think it
possible he could have conceived them; however, desirous of doing what
his task imposed upon him, he was unwilling to leave it untranslated, and

it is this sort of talk, and what sancho says lower down, that made the
translator of the history say he considered this chapter apocryphal.

"don't you see, you animal," continued sancho, "that it will be well for
me to drop into some profitable government that will lift us out of the
mire, and marry mari-sancha to whom i like; and you yourself will find
yourself called 'dona teresa panza,' and sitting in church on a fine
carpet and cushions and draperies, in spite and in defiance of all the
born ladies of the town? no, stay as you are, growing neither greater nor
less, like a tapestry figure--let us say no more about it, for sanchica

up another of the drollest and strangest contrivances that can be
imagined.

"so be it by all means," said the duchess; "tomorrow i'll give you a
scourge that will be just the thing for you, and will accommodate itself
to the tenderness of your flesh, as if it was its own sister."

then said sancho, "your highness must know, dear lady of my soul, that i
have a letter written to my wife, teresa panza, giving her an account of
all that has happened me since i left her; i have it here in my bosom,
and there's nothing wanting but to put the address to it; i'd be glad if
your discretion would read it, for i think it runs in the governor style;
i mean the way governors ought to write."

"and who dictated it?" asked the duchess.

"who should have dictated but myself, sinner as i am?" said sancho.

"and did you write it yourself?" said the duchess.

"that i didn't," said sancho; "for i

cide hamete, the painstaking investigator of the minute points of this
veracious history, says that when dona rodriguez left her own room to go
to don quixote's, another duenna who slept with her observed her, and as
all duennas are fond of prying, listening, and sniffing, she followed her
so silently that the good rodriguez never perceived it; and as soon as
the duenna saw her enter don quixote's room, not to fail in a duenna's
invariable practice of tattling, s

manner already described; for indignities offered to their charms and
self-esteem mightily provoke the anger of women and make them eager for
revenge. the duchess told the duke what had happened, and he was much
amused by it; and she, in pursuance of her design of making merry and
diverting herself with don quixote, despatched the page who had played
the part of dulcinea in the negotiations for her disenchantment (which
sancho panza in the cares of government had forgotten all about) to
teresa panza his wife with her husband's letter and another from herself,
and also a great string of fine coral beads as a present.

now the history says this page was very sharp and quick-witted; and eager
to serve his lord and lady he set off very willingly for sancho's
village. before he entered it he observed a number of women washing in a
brook, and asked them if they could tell him whether there lived there a
woman of the name of teresa panza, wife of one sancho panza, squire to a
knight calle

was washing stood up and said, "teresa panza is my mother, and that
sancho is my father, and that knight is our master."

"well then, miss," said the page, "come and show me where your mother is,
for i bring her a letter and a present from your father."

"that i will with all my heart, senor," said the girl, who seemed to be
about fourteen, more or less; and leaving the clothes she was washing to
one of her companions, and without putting anything on her head or feet,
for she was bare-legged and had her hair hanging about her, aw

enough at not having had any news of my father this ever so long."

"well," said the page, "i am bringing her such good news that she will
have reason to thank god."

and then, skipping, running, and capering, the girl reached the town, but
before going into the house she called out at the door, "come out, mother
teresa, come out, come out; here's a gentleman with letters and other
things from my good father." at these words her mother teresa panza came
out spinning a bundle of flax, in a grey petticoat (so short was it one
would have fancied "they to her shame had cut it short"), a grey bodice
of the same stuff, and a smock. she was not very old, though plainly past
forty, strong, healthy, vigorous, and sun-dried; and seeing her daughter
and the page on horseback, she exclaimed, "what's this, child? what
gentleman is this?"

"a servant of my lady, dona teresa panza," replied the page; and suiting
the action to the word he flung

with this teresa hurried out of the house with the letters, and with the
string of beads round her neck, and went along thrumming the letters as
if they were a tambourine, and by chance coming across the curate and
samson carrasco she began capering and saying, "none of us poor now,
faith! we've got a little government! ay, let the finest fine lady tackle
me, and i'll give her a setting down!"

"what's all this, teresa panza," said they; "what madness is this, and
what papers are those?"

"the madness is only this," said she, "that these are the letters of
duchesses and governors, and these i have on my neck are fine coral
beads, with ave-marias and paternosters of beaten gold, and i am a
governess."

"god help us," said the curate, "we don't understand you, teresa, or know
what you are talking about."

"there, you may see it yourselves," said teresa, and she handed them the
letters.

and now, to complete the enjoyment of the feast and bring the dinner to a

hall; and the duke and duchess were very well pleased to see him, being
anxious to know the result of his journey; but when they asked him the
page said in reply that he could not give it before so many people or in
a few words, and begged their excellences to be pleased to let it wait
for a private opportunity, and in the meantime amuse themselves with

all were greatly amused by teresa panza's letter, but particularly the
duke and duchess; and the duchess asked don quixote's opinion whether
they might open the letter that had come for the governor, which she
suspected must be very good. don quixote said that to gratify them he
would open it, and did so, and found that it ran as follows.

the letters were applauded, laughed over, relished, and admired; and
then, as if to put the seal to the business, the courier arrived,
bringing the one sancho sent to don quixote, and this, too, was read out,
and it raised some doubts as to the governor's simplicity. the duchess
withdrew to hear from the page about his adventures in sancho's village,
which he narrated at full length without leaving a single circumstance
unmentioned. he gave her the acorns, and also a cheese which te

knight, and he felt too that he would have to render a strict account to
heaven of that indolence and seclusion; and so one day he asked the duke
and duchess to grant him permission to take his departure. they gave it,
showing at the same time that they were very sorry he was leaving them.

the duchess gave his wife's letters to sancho panza, who shed tears over
them, saying, "who would have thought that such grand hopes as the news
of my government bred in my wife teresa panza's breast would end in my
going back now to the vagabond adventures of my master don quixote of la
mancha? still i'm glad to see my teresa behaved as she ought in sending
the acorns, for if she had not sent them i'd have been sorry, and she'd
have shown herself ungrateful. it is a comfort to me that they can't call
that present a bribe; for i had got the government already when she sent
them, and it's but reasonable that those who have had a good turn done

he goes wrong and departs from the truth in the most important part of
the history, for here he says that my squire sancho panza's wife is
called mari gutierrez, when she is called nothing of the sort, but teresa

good reason to fear that he is in error on every other point in the
history."

"a nice sort of historian, indeed!" exclaimed sancho at this; "he must
know a deal about our affairs when he calls my wife teresa panza, mari
gutierrez; take the book again, senor, and see if i am in it and if he
has changed my name."

"from your talk, friend," said don jeronimo, "no doubt you are sancho

induced the duke and duchess to get up the elaborate plot that has been
described. the bachelor samson carrasco, he says, not forgetting how he
as the knight of the mirrors had been vanquished and overthrown by don
quixote, which defeat and overthrow upset all his plans, resolved to try
his hand again, hoping for better luck than he had before; and so, having
learned where don quixote was from the page who brought the letter and
present to sancho's wife, teresa panza, he got himself new armour and
another horse, and put a white moon upon his shield, and to carry his
arms he had a mule led by a peasant, not by tom cecial his former squire
for fear he should be recognised by sancho or don quixote. he came to the
duke's castle, and the duke informed him of the road and route don
quixote had taken with the intention of being present at the jousts at
saragossa. he told him, too, of the jokes he had practised upon him, and
of the device for the disenchantm

"and mine," added sancho; "for i never in all my life saw a lace-maker
that died for love; when damsels are at work their minds are more set on
finishing their tasks than on thinking of their loves. i speak from my
own experience; for when i'm digging i never think of my old woman; i
mean my teresa panza, whom i love better than my own eyelids." "you say
well, sancho," said the duchess, "and i will take care that my altisidora
employs herself henceforward in needlework of some sort; for she is
extremely expert at it." "there is no occasion to have recourse to that
remedy, senora," said altisidora; "for the mere thought of the cruelty

running to see it, calling out to one another, "come here, boys, and see
sancho panza's ass figged out finer than mingo, and don quixote's beast
leaner than ever."

so at length, with the boys capering round them, and accompanied by the
curate and the bachelor, they made their entrance into the town, and
proceeded to don quixote's house, at the door of which they found his
housekeeper and niece, whom the news of his arrival had already reached.
it had been brought to teresa panza, sancho's wife, as well, and she with
her hair all loose and half naked, dragging sanchica her daughter by the
