outward adornings; but they were a little curious to my unaccustomed
sight, and therefore i dilate upon them. but to underrate or forget thy
faithful services is something i could never be guilty of, even in the
giddiest moment of my life.

the father of my attached follower was a native of gigantic frame, and
had once possessed prodigious physical powers; but the lofty form was
now yielding to the inroads of time, though the hand of disease seemed
never to have been laid upon the aged warrior. marheyo--for such was
his name--appeared to have retired from all active participation in the
affairs of the valley, seldom or never accompanying the natives in
their various expeditions; and employing the greater part of his time
in throwing up a little shed just outside the house, upon which he was
engaged to my certain knowledge for four months, without appearing
to make any sensible advance. i suppose the old gentleman was in his
dotage, for he manifested in various ways the characteristics which m

his ears, he would seize his spear--which in length and slightness
resembled a fishing-pole--and go stalking beneath the shadows of the
neighbouring groves, as if about to give a hostile meeting to some
cannibal knight. but he would soon return again, and hiding his weapon
under the projecting eaves of the house, and rolling his clumsy trinkets
carefully in a piece of tappa, would resume his more pacific operations
as quietly as if he had never interrupted them.

but despite his eccentricities, marheyo was a most paternal and
warm-hearted old fellow, and in this particular not a little resembled
his son kory-kory. the mother of the latter was the mistress of the
family, and a notable housewife, and a most industrious old lady she
was. if she did not understand the art of making jellies, jams, custard,
tea-cakes, and such like trashy affairs, she was profoundly skilled in
the mysteries of preparing â€˜amarâ€™, â€˜poee-poeeâ€™, and â€˜kokooâ€™, with other
substantial matters.

insisted upon feeding me with his own hands. to this procedure i, of
course, most earnestly objected, but in vain; and having laid a calabash
of kokoo before me, he washed his fingers in a vessel of water, and then
putting his hands into the dish and rolling the food into little balls,

we resumed our seats, while, assisted by the zealous kory-kory, he
appeared to be engaged in giving directions to a number of the natives
outside, who were busily employed in making arrangements, the nature
of which we could not comprehend. but we were not left long in our
ignorance, for a few moments only had elapsed, when the chief beckoned
us to approach, and we perceived that he had been marshalling a kind of
guard of honour to escort us on our return to the house of marheyo.

the procession was led off by two venerable-looking savages, each
provided with a spear, from the end of which streamed a pennon of
milk-white tappa. after them went several youths, bearing aloft
calabashes of poee-poee, and followed in their turn by four stalwart
fellows, sustaining long bamboos, from the tops of which hung
suspended, at least twenty feet from the ground, large baskets of
green bread-fruits. then came a troop of boys, carrying bunches of ripe
bananas, and baskets made of the

 tree, the naked shells stripped of
their husks peeping forth from the verdant wicker-work that surrounded
them. last of all came a burly islander, holding over his head a wooden
trencher, in which lay disposed the remnants of our midnight feast,
hidden from view, however, by a covering of bread-fruit leaves.

astonished as i was at this exhibition, i could not avoid smiling at
its grotesque appearance, and the associations it naturally called
up. mehevi, it seemed, was bent on replenishing old marheyoâ€™s larder,
fearful perhaps that without this precaution his guests might not fare
as well as they could desire.

as soon as i descended from the pi-pi, the procession formed anew,
enclosing us in its centre; where i remained part of the time, carried
by kory-kory, and occasionally relieving him from his burden by limping
along with spear. when we moved off in this order, the natives struck
up a musical recitative, which with various alternations, they continued
until we arrived at the place of

 our destination.

as we proceeded on our way, bands of young girls, darting from the
surrounding groves, hung upon our skirts, and accompanied us with shouts
of merriment and delight, which almost drowned the deep notes of the
recitative. on approaching old marheyoâ€™s domicile, its inmates rushed
out to receive us; and while the gifts of mehevi were being disposed of,
the superannuated warrior did the honours of his mansion with all the
warmth of hospitality evinced by an english squire when he regales his
friends at some fine old patrimonial mansion.

which i assured the natives i should speedily recover if toby were
permitted to obtain the supplies i needed.

it was agreed that on the following morning my companion should depart,
accompanied by some one or two of the household, who should point out to
him an easy route, by which the bay might be reached before sunset.

at early dawn of the next day, our habitation was astir. one of the
young men mounted into an adjoining cocoanut tree, and threw down a
number of the young fruit, which old marheyo quickly stripped of the
green husks, and strung together upon a short pole. these were intended
to refresh toby on his route.

the preparations being completed, with no little emotion i bade my
companion adieu. he promised to return in three days at farthest; and,
bidding me keep up my spirits in the interval, turned round the corner
of the pi-pi, and, under the guidance of the venerable marheyo, was
soon out of sight. his departure oppressed me with melancholy, and,
re-entering the dwelling, i

old tinor now appeared, holding in her hand some simples she had
gathered, the juice of which she by signs besought me to squeeze into
the wound. having done so, i thought it best to leave toby undisturbed
until he should have had time to rally his faculties. several times he
opened his lips, but fearful for his safety i enjoined silence. in the
course of two or three hours, however, he sat up, and was sufficiently
recovered to tell me what had occurred.

â€˜after leaving the house with marheyo,â€™ said toby, â€˜we struck across the
valley, and ascended the opposite heights. just beyond them, my guide
informed me, lay the valley of happar, while along their summits, and
skirting the head of the vale, was my route to nukuheva. after mounting
a little way up the elevation my guide paused, and gave me to understand
that he could not accompany me any farther, and by various signs
intimated that he was afraid to approach any nearer the territories of
the enemies of his tribe. he however po

fellows gave a roar of rage and disappointment; but they were afraid, i
suppose, of coming down further into the typee valley, and so abandoned
the chase. i saw them recover their weapons and turn back; and i
continued my descent as fast as i could.

â€˜what could have caused this ferocious attack on the part of these
happars i could not imagine, unless it were that they had seen me
ascending the mountain with marheyo, and that the mere fact of coming
from the typee valley was sufficient to provoke them.

â€˜as long as i was in danger i scarcely felt the wound i had received;
but when the chase was over i began to suffer from it. i had lost my
hat in the flight, and the run scorched my bare head. i felt faint
and giddy; but, fearful of falling to the ground beyond the reach of
assistance, i staggered on as well as i could, and at last gained the
level of the valley, and then down i sank; and i knew nothing m

descry the form of my companion. but one after another they passed the
dwelling, and i caught no glimpse of him. supposing, however, that he
would soon appear with some of the members of the household, i quieted
my apprehensions, and waited patiently to see him advancing in company
with the beautiful fayaway. at last, i perceived tinor coming forward,
followed by the girls and young men who usually resided in the house of
marheyo; but with them came not my comrade, and, filled with a thousand
alarms, i eagerly sought to discover the cause of his delay.

my earnest questions appeared to embarrass the natives greatly. all
their accounts were contradictory: one giving me to understand that
toby would be with me in a very short time; another that he did not know
where he was; while a third, violently inveighing, against him, assured
me that he had stolen away, and would never come back. it appeared

kindness of marheyo and the rest of the islanders--a full description of
the bread-fruit tree--different modes of preparing the fruit

all the inhabitants of the valley treated me with great kindness; but as
to the household of marheyo, with whom i was now permanently domiciled,
nothing could surpass their efforts to minister to my comfort. to the
gratification of my palate they paid the most unwearied attention.
they continually invited me to partake of food, and when after eating
heartily i declined the viands t

hey continued to offer me, they seemed
to think that my appetite stood in need of some piquant stimulant to
excite its activity.

in pursuance of this idea, old marheyo himself would hie him away to
the sea-shore by the break of day, for the purpose of collecting
various species of rare sea-weed; some of which among these people are
considered a great luxury. after a whole day spent in this employment,
he would return about nightfall with several cocoanut shells filled with
different descriptions of kelp. in preparing these for use he manifested
all the ostentation of a professed cook, although the chief mystery of
the affair appeared to consist in pouring wat

the net-like fibrous substance attached to all cocoanut trees, and
compressing it over the bread-fruit, which being now sufficiently
pounded, is put into a wooden bowl--extracts a thick creamy milk. the
delicious liquid soon bubbles round the fruit, and leaves it at last
just peeping above its surface.

this preparation is called â€˜kokooâ€™, and a most luscious preparation it
is. the hobby-horse and the pestle and mortar were in great requisition
during the time i remained in the house of marheyo, and kory-kory had
frequent occasion to show his skill in their use.

but the great staple articles of food into which the bread-fruit is
converted by these natives are known respectively by the names of amar
and poee-poee.

at a certain season of the year, when the fruit of the hundred groves
of the valley has reached its maturity, and hangs in golden spheres from
every branch, the islanders assemble in harvest groups, and garner in
the abundance which surrounds them.

this stately tree, which is rarely met with upon the sandwich islands,
and then only of a very inferior quality, and at tahiti does not abound
to a degree that renders its fruit the principal article of food,
attains its greatest excellence in the genial climate of the marquesan
group, where it grows to an enormous magnitude, and flourishes in the
utmost abundance.

melancholy condition--occurrence at the ti--anecdote of marheyo--shaving
the head of a warrior

in looking back to this period, and calling to remembrance the
numberless proofs of kindness and respect which i received from the
natives of the valley, i can scarcely understand how it was that, in the
midst of so many consolatory circumstances, my mind should still have
been consumed by the most dismal forebodings, and have remained a
prey to the profoundest melancholy. it is true that the suspicious
circumstances which had attended the disappearance of toby w

ed from a vague report

immediately all was bustle and animation. it so happened that day that
the pain i suffered having somewhat abated, and feeling in much better
spirits than usual, i had complied with kory-koryâ€™s invitation to visit
the chief mehevi at the place called the â€˜tiâ€™, which i have before
described as being situated within the precincts of the taboo groves.
these sacred recesses were at no great distance from marheyoâ€™s
habitation, and lay between it and the sea; the path that conducted to
the beach passing directly in front of the ti, and thence skirting along
the border of the groves.

i was reposing upon the mats, within the sacred building, in company
with mehevi and several other chiefs, when the announcement was first
made. it sent a thrill of joy through my whole frame;--perhaps toby was
about to return. i rose at once to my feet, and my instinctive impulse
was to hurry down to the beach, equally re

gardless of the distance that
separated me from it, and of my disabled condition. as soon as mehevi
noticed the effect the intelligence had produced upon me, and the
impatience i betrayed to reach the sea, his countenance assumed that
inflexible rigidity of expression which had so awed me on the afternoon
of our arrival at the house of marheyo. as i was proceeding to leave
the ti, he laid his hand upon my shoulder, and said gravely, â€˜abo, aboâ€™
(wait, wait). solely intent upon the one thought that occupied my mind,
and heedless of his request, i was brushing past him, when suddenly he
assumed a tone of authority, and told me to â€˜moeeâ€™ (sit down). though
struck by the alteration in his demeanour, the excitement under which i
laboured was too strong to permit me to obey the unexpected command,
and i was still limping towards the

ed my in-door dress;
whenever i walked out, i superadded to it an ample robe of the same
material, which completely enveloped my person, and screened it from the
rays of the sun.

one morning i made a rent in this mantle; and to show the islanders with
what facility it could be repaired, i lowered my bundle, and taking
from it a needle and thread, proceeded to stitch up the opening. they
regarded this wonderful application of science with intense admiration;
and whilst i was stitching away, old marheyo, who was one of the
lookers-on, suddenly clapped his hand to his forehead, and rushing to
a corner of the house, drew forth a soiled and tattered strip of faded
calico which he must have procured some time or other in traffic on the
beach--and besought me eagerly to exercise a little of my art upon it.
i willingly complied, though certainly so stumpy a needle as mine never
took such gigantic strides over calico before. the repairs completed,
old marheyo gave me a paternal hug; and divesting him

progress was barred by an express prohibition of the savages; and after
having made two or three ineffectual attempts to reach it, as much to
gratify my curiosity as anything else, i gave up the idea. it was in
vain to think of reaching it by stealth, since the natives escorted me
in numbers wherever i went, and not for one single moment that i can
recall to mind was i ever permitted to be alone.

the green and precipitous elevations that stood ranged around the
head of the vale where marheyoâ€™s habitation was situated effectually
precluded all hope of escape in that quarter, even if i could have
stolen away from the thousand eyes of the savages.

but these reflections now seldom obtruded upon me; i gave myself up to
the passing hour, and if ever disagreeable thoughts arose in my mind, i
drove them away. when i looked around the verdant recess in which i was
buried, and gazed up to the summits of the lofty eminence that hemmed me
in, i was well disposed to think that i was in the â

om the strange noises which rang in
my ears, and the supernatural visions dancing before my eyes, i thought
i was in the land of the spirits. i stood indeed as little chance among
them as a cumbrous whale attacked on all sides by a legion of swordfish.
when at length they relinquished their hold of me, they swam away in
every direction, laughing at my clumsy endeavours to reach them.

there was no boat on the lake; but at my solicitation and for my special
use, some of the young men attached to marheyoâ€™s household, under
the direction of the indefatigable kory-kory, brought up a light and
tastefully carved canoe from the sea. it was launched upon the sheet
of water, and floated there as gracefully as a swan. but, melancholy to
relate, it produced an effect i had not anticipated. the sweet nymphs,
who had sported with me before on the lake, now all fled its vicinity.
the prohibited craft, guarded by the edicts of the â€˜taboo,â€™ extended the
prohibition to the waters in which it lay.

sufficiently far above the ground to reveal the most bewitching ankle in
the universe.

the day that fayaway first wore this robe was rendered memorable by a
new acquaintance being introduced to me. in the afternoon i was lying
in the house when i heard a great uproar outside; but being by this time
pretty well accustomed to the wild halloos which were almost continually
ringing through the valley, i paid little attention to it, until old
marheyo, under the influence of some strange excitement, rushed into my
presence and communicated the astounding tidings, â€˜marnoo pemi!â€™ which
being interpreted, implied that an individual by the name of marnoo was
approaching.

my worthy old friend evidently expected that this intelligence would
produce a great effect upon me, and for a time he stood earnestly
regarding me, as if curious to see how i should conduct myself, but as
i remained perfectly unmoved, the old gentleman darted out of the ho

ncontrollable mirth.

struck by his demeanour, and the peculiarity of his appearance, so
unlike that of the shaven-crowned and face-tattooed natives in general,
i involuntarily rose as he entered the house, and proffered him a seat
on the mats beside me. but without deigning to notice the civility, or
even the more incontrovertible fact of my existence, the stranger passed
on, utterly regardless of me, and flung himself upon the further end
of the long couch that traversed the sole apartment of marheyoâ€™s
habitation.

had the belle of the season, in the pride of her beauty and power, been
cut in a place of public resort by some supercilious exquisite, she
could not have felt greater indignation than i did at this unexpected
slight.

i was thrown into utter astonishment. the conduct of the savages had
prepared me to anticipate from every newcomer the same extravagant
expressions of curiosity and regard. the singularity of his conduct,
however, only roused my desire to discover who this remark

so seizing his roll of tappa, and grasping his spear, he advanced to
the front of the pi-pi, and waving his hand in adieu to the now silent
throng, cast upon me a glance of mingled pity and reproach, and flung
himself into the path which led from the house. i watched his receding
figure until it was lost in the obscurity of the grove, and then gave
myself up to the most desponding reflections.



chapter nineteen

reflections after marnooâ€™s departure-battle of the pop-guns--strange
conceit of marheyo--process of making tappa

the knowledge i had now obtained as to the intention of the savages
deeply affected me.

marnoo, i perceived, was a man who, by reason of his superior
acquirements, and the knowledge he possessed of the events which were
taking place in the different bays of the island, was held in no little
estimation by the inhabitants of the valley. he had been received with
the most cordial welcome and respect. the natives had hung upon the
accents of his voice, and, had manifested

pi-pi.

pop, pop, pop, pop! green guavas, seeds, and berries were flying about
in every direction, and during this dangerous state of affairs i was
half afraid that, like the man and his brazen bull, i should fall
a victim to my own ingenuity. like everything else, however, the
excitement gradually wore away, though ever after occasionally pop-guns
might be heard at all hours of the day.

it was towards the close of the pop-gun war, that i was infinitely
diverted with a strange freak of marheyoâ€™s.

i had worn, when i quitted the ship, a pair of thick pumps, which, from
the rough usage they had received in scaling precipices and sliding down
gorges, were so dilapidated as to be altogether unfit for use--so, at
least, would have thought the generality of people, and so they most
certainly were, when considered in the light of shoes. but things
unservicable in one way, may with advantage be applied in another,
that is, if one have genius enough for the purpose. this genius marheyo

and i observed that for several days
after becoming an inmate of the house, my pumps were suffered to remain,
untouched, where i had first happened to throw them. i remembered,
however, that after awhile i had missed them from their accustomed
place; but the matter gave me no concern, supposing that tinor--like any
other tidy housewife, having come across them in some of her domestic
occupations--had pitched the useless things out of the house. but i was
soon undeceived.

one day i observed old marheyo bustling about me with unusual activity,
and to such a degree as almost to supersede kory-kory in the functions
of his office. one moment he volunteered to trot off with me on his back
to the stream; and when i refused, noways daunted by the repulse, he
continued to frisk about me like a superannuated house-dog. i could not
for the life of me conjecture what possessed the old gentleman, until
all at once, availing himself of the temporary absence of the household,
he went through a variety of o

ong before.

i immediately comprehended his desire, and very generously gave him the
shoes, which had become quite mouldy, wondering for what earthly purpose
he could want them. the same afternoon i descried the venerable warrior
approaching the house, with a slow, stately gait, ear-rings in ears, and
spear in hand, with this highly ornamental pair of shoes suspended from
his neck by a strip of bark, and swinging backwards and forwards on
his capacious chest. in the gala costume of the tasteful marheyo, these
calf-skin pendants ever after formed the most striking feature.

but to turn to something a little more important. although the whole
existence of the inhabitants of the valley seemed to pass away exempt
from toil, yet there were some light employments which, although amusing
rather than laborious as occupations, contributed to their comfort and
luxury. among these the most important was the manufacture of the native
cloth,--â€˜tappaâ€™,--so well known, under various modifications, throu

pikes above the happar mountain, ere i threw
aside my tappa robe, and girding my long tunic about my waist, sallied
out with fayaway and kory-kory, and the rest of the household, and bent
my steps towards the stream. here we found congregated all those who
dwelt in our section of the valley; and here we bathed with them. the
fresh morning air and the cool flowing waters put both soul and body in
a glow, and after a half-hour employed in this recreation, we sauntered
back to the house--tinor and marheyo gathering dry sticks by the way
for fire-wood; some of the young men laying the cocoanut trees under
contribution as they passed beneath them; while kory-kory played his
outlandish pranks for my particular diversion, and fayaway and i, not
arm in arm to be sure, but sometimes hand in hand, strolled along, with
feelings of perfect charity for all the world, and especial good-will
towards each other.

our morning meal was soon prepared. the islanders are somewhat
abstemious at this repast; reserv

trenchers, of poee-poee; which was devoted exclusively for my own use,
being mixed with the milky meat of ripe cocoanut. a section of a roasted
bread-fruit, a small cake of â€˜amarâ€™, or a mess of â€˜cokoo,â€™ two or three
bananas, or a mammee-apple; an annuee, or some other agreeable and
nutritious fruit served from day to day to diversify the meal, which was
finished by tossing off the liquid contents of a young cocoanut or two.

while partaking of this simple repast, the inmates of marheyoâ€™s house,
after the style of the ancient romans, reclined in sociable groups upon
the divan of mats, and digestion was promoted by cheerful conversation.

after the morning meal was concluded, pipes were lighted; and among them
my own especial pipe, a present from the noble mehevi.

the islanders, who only smoke a whiff or two at a time, and at long
intervals, and who keep their pipes going from hand to hand continually,
regarded my systematic smoking of four or five pipefuls of tobacco in

cession, as something quite wonderful. when two or three pipes had
circulated freely, the company gradually broke up. marheyo went to the
little hut he was forever building. tinor began to inspect her rolls of
tappa, or employed her busy fingers in plaiting grass-mats. the girls
anointed themselves with their fragrant oils, dressed their hair, or
looked over their curious finery, and compared together their ivory
trinkets, fashioned out of boarâ€™s tusks or whaleâ€™s teeth. the young men
and warriors produced their spears, paddles, canoe-gear, battle-clubs,
and war-conchs, and occupied themselves in carving, all sorts

well as the best of them--and once, with my knife, carved the handle of
a javelin so exquisitely, that i have no doubt, to this day, karnoonoo,
its owner, preserves it as a surprising specimen of my skill. as noon
approached, all those who had wandered forth from our habitation, began
to return; and when midday was fairly come scarcely a sound was to be
heard in the valley: a deep sleep fell upon all. the luxurious siesta
was hardly ever omitted, except by old marheyo, who was so eccentric
a character, that he seemed to be governed by no fixed principles
whatever; but acting just according to the humour of the moment,
slept, ate, or tinkered away at his little hut, without regard to the
proprieties of time or place. frequently he might have been seen taking
a nap in the sun at noon-day, or a bath in the stream of mid-night.
once i beheld him perched eighty feet from the ground, in the tuft of a
cocoanut tree, smoking; and often i saw him standing up to the w

rusion, there was no restraint
upon the hilarity of the warriors, who, like the gentlemen of europe
after the cloth is drawn and the ladies retire, freely indulged their
mirth.

after spending a considerable portion of the afternoon at the ti, i
usually found myself, as the cool of the evening came on, either sailing
on the little lake with fayaway, or bathing in the waters of the
stream with a number of the savages, who, at this hour, always repaired
thither. as the shadows of night approached marheyoâ€™s household were
once more assembled under his roof: tapers were lit, long curious chants
were raised, interminable stories were told (for which one present was
little the wiser), and all sorts of social festivities served to while
away the time.

the young girls very often danced by moonlight in front of their
dwellings. there are a great variety of these dances, in which, however,
i never saw the men take part. they all consist of active, romping,
mischievous evolutions, in which every limb

the damsels wear nothing but flowers and their compendious gala tunics;
and when they plume themselves for the dance, they look like a band of
olive-coloured sylphides on the point of taking wing. in good sooth,
they so sway their floating forms, arch their necks, toss aloft their
naked arms, and glide, and swim, and whirl, that it was almost too much
for a quiet, sober-minded, modest young man like myself.

unless some particular festivity was going forward, the inmates of
marheyoâ€™s house retired to their mats rather early in the evening; but
not for the night, since, after slumbering lightly for a while, they
rose again, relit their tapers, partook of the third and last meal of
the day, at which poee-poee alone was eaten, and then, after inhaling a
narcotic whiff from a pipe of tobacco, disposed themselves for the great
business of night, sleep. with the marquesans it might almost most be
styled the great business of life, for they pass a large portion

*i presume this might be translated into â€˜strong watersâ€™. arva is the
name bestowed upon a root the properties of which are both inebriating
and medicinal. â€˜waiâ€™ is the marquesan word for water.



the water is held in high estimation by the islanders, some of whom
consider it an agreeable as well as a medicinal beverage; they bring it
from the mountain in their calabashes, and store it away beneath heaps
of leaves in some shady nook near the house. old marheyo had a great
love for the waters of the spring. every now and then he lugged off to
the mountain a great round demijohn of a calabash, and, panting with his
exertions, brought it back filled with his darling fluid.

the water tasted like a solution of a dozen disagreeable things, and was
sufficiently nauseous to have made the fortune of the proprietor, had
the spa been situated in the midst of any civilized community.

as i am no chemist, i cannot give a scientific analysis of the water.

now about the matter is, that one day marheyo in my presence
poured out the last drop from his huge calabash, and i observed at the
bottom of the vessel a small quantity of gravelly sediment very much

and gives it its peculiar flavour and virtues, or whether its presence
was merely incidental, i was not able to ascertain.

one day in returning from this spring by a circuitous path, i came upon
a scene which reminded me of stonehenge and the architectural labours of

crockery, and immediately addressed himself in the task of enlightening
me: but all in vain; and to this hour the nature of the monument remains
a complete mystery to me. as, however, it formed so prominent a feature
in the approaching revels, i bestowed upon the latter, in my own mind,
the title of the â€˜feast of calabashesâ€™.

the following morning, awaking rather late, i perceived the whole of
marheyoâ€™s family busily engaged in preparing for the festival.

the old warrior himself was arranging in round balls the two grey locks
of hair that were suffered to grow from the crown of his head; his
earrings and spear, both well polished, lay beside him, while the highly
decorative pair of shoes hung suspended from a projecting cane against
the side of the house. the young men were similarly employed; and the
fair damsels, including fayaway, were anointing themselves with â€˜akaâ€™,
arranging the

ed what particular station to assign to mehevi. but the
important part he took upon that occasion convinced me that he had no
superior among the inhabitants of the valley. i had invariably noticed a
certain degree of deference paid to him by all with whom i had ever seen
him brought in contact; but when i remembered that my wanderings had
been confined to a limited portion of the valley, and that towards
the sea a number of distinguished chiefs resided, some of whom had
separately visited me at marheyoâ€™s house, and whom, until the festival,
i had never seen in the company of mehevi, i felt disposed to believe
that his rank after all might not be particularly elevated.

the revels, however, had brought together all the warriors whom i had
seen individually and in groups at different times and places. among
them mehevi moved with an easy air of superiority which was not to be
mistaken; and he whom i had only looked at as the hospitable host of the
ti, and one of the military leaders of the tr

e.

after having made this discovery i could not avoid congratulating myself
that mehevi had from the first taken me as it were under his royal
protection, and that he still continued to entertain for me the warmest
regard, as far at least as i was enabled to judge from appearances. for
the future i determined to pay most assiduous court to him, hoping that
eventually through his kindness i might obtain my liberty.

previously to seeing the dancing widows i had little idea that there
were any matrimonial relations subsisting in typee, and i should as soon
have thought of a platonic affection being cultivated between the sexes,
as of the solemn connection of man and wife. to be sure, there were old
marheyo and tinor, who seemed to have a sort of nuptial understanding
with one another; but for all that, i had sometimes observed a
comical-looking old gentleman dressed in a suit of shabby tattooing, who
had the audacity to take various liberties with the lady, and that too
in the very presence of the old warrior her husband, who looked on
as good-naturedly as if nothing was happening. this behaviour, until
subsequent discoveries enlightened me, puzzled me more than anything
else i witnessed in typee

those snug little arrangements they had
made in their comfortable dwelling. i strongly suspected however, that
some of these jolly bachelors were carrying on love intrigues with
the maidens of the tribe; although they did not appear publicly to
acknowledge them. i happened to pop upon mehevi three or four times when
he was romping--in a most undignified manner for a warrior king--with
one of the prettiest little witches in the valley. she lived with an
old woman and a young man, in a house near marheyoâ€™s; and although in
appearance a mere child herself, had a noble boy about a year old, who
bore a marvellous resemblance to mehevi, whom i should certainly have
believed to have been the father, were it not that the little fellow
had no triangle on his face--but on second thoughts, tattooing is not
hereditary. mehevi, however, was not the only person upon whom the
damsel moonoony smiled--the young fellow of fifteen, who permanently
resided in the home with her, was decidedly in her good graces

each islander reposed beneath his own palmetto thatching, or sat under
his own bread-fruit trees, with none to molest or alarm him. there was
not a padlock in the valley, nor anything that answered the purpose
of one: still there was no community of goods. this long spear, so
elegantly carved, and highly polished, belongs to wormoonoo: it is far
handsomer than the one which old marheyo so greatly prizes; it is the
most valuable article belonging to its owner. and yet i have seen it
leaning against a cocoanut tree in the grove, and there it was found
when sought for. here is a sperm-whale tooth, graven all over with
cunning devices: it is the property of karluna; it is the most precious
of the damselâ€™s ornaments. in her estimation its price is far above
rubies--and yet there hangs the dental jewel by its cord of braided

sters, and bearing them off, one after another, to different parts
of the vale, shouting and trampling as they went. no churlish old
curmudgeon could have been the owner of that grove of bread-fruit trees,
or of these gloriously yellow bunches of bananas.

from what i have said it will be perceived that there is a vast
difference between â€˜personal propertyâ€™ and â€˜real estateâ€™ in the valley
of typee. some individuals, of course, are more wealthy than others.
for example, the ridge-pole of marheyoâ€™s house bends under the weight of
many a huge packet of tappa; his long couch is laid with mats placed one
upon the other seven deep. outside, tinor has ranged along in her
bamboo cupboard--or whatever the place may be called--a goodly array of
calabashes and wooden trenchers. now, the house just beyond the grove,
and next to marheyoâ€™s, occupied by ruaruga, is not quite so well
furnished. there are only three moderate-sized packages swinging
overhead: there are only two layers of mats benea

th; and the calabashes
and trenchers are not so numerous, nor so tastefully stained and carved.
but then, ruaruga has a house--not so pretty a one, to be sure--but just
as commodious as marheyoâ€™s; and, i suppose, if he wished to vie with
his neighbourâ€™s establishment, he could do so with very little trouble.
these, in short, constituted the chief differences perceivable in the
relative wealth of the people in typee.

even her full share of them. they flourish in greater abundance and

t, and in a sort of transport communicated the intelligence
contained in the words â€˜pehee perniâ€™ (fish come). as i happened to have
been in a remarkably sound and refreshing slumber, i could not imagine
why the information had not been deferred until morning, indeed, i felt
very much inclined to fly into a passion and box my valetâ€™s ears; but on
second thoughts i got quietly up, and on going outside the house was not
a little interested by the moving illumination which i beheld.

when old marheyo received his share of the spoils, immediate
preparations were made for a midnight banquet; calabashes of poee-poee
were filled to the brim; green bread-fruit were roasted; and a huge cake
of â€˜amarâ€™ was cut up with a sliver of bamboo and laid out on an immense
banana-leaf.

at this supper we were lighted by several of the native tapers, held in
the hands of young girls. these tapers are most ingeniously made. there

at the top of the cocoanut tree the numerous branches, radiating on
all sides from a common centre, form a sort of green and waving
basket, between the leaflets of which you just discern the nuts thickly
clustering together, and on the loftier trees looking no bigger from
the ground than bunches of grapes. i remember one adventurous little
fellow--too-too was the rascalâ€™s name--who had built himself a sort of
aerial baby-house in the picturesque tuft of a tree adjoining marheyoâ€™s
habitation. he used to spend hours there,--rustling among the branches,
and shouting with delight every time the strong gusts of wind rushing
down from the mountain side, swayed to and fro the tall and flexible
column on which he was perched. whenever i heard too-tooâ€™s musical voice
sounding strangely to the ear from so great a height, and beheld him
peeping down upon me from out his leafy covert, he always recalled to my
mind dibdinâ€™s lines--

in a fit of desperation, signed to him to commence operations. but he
rejected the compromise indignantly, and still continued his attack on
my face, as though nothing short of that would satisfy him. when his
forefinger swept across my features, in laying out the borders of those
parallel bands which were to encircle my countenance, the flesh fairly
crawled upon my bones. at last, half wild with terror and indignation, i
succeeded in breaking away from the three savages, and fled towards old
marheyoâ€™s house, pursued by the indomitable artist, who ran after me,
implements in hand. kory-kory, however, at last interfered and drew him
off from the chase.

this incident opened my eyes to a new danger; and i now felt convinced
that in some luckless hour i should be disfigured in such a manner as
never more to have the face to return to my countrymen, even should an
opportunity offer.

these apprehensions were greatly increased by the desire which king

sadly discursive as i have already been, i must still further entreat
the readerâ€™s patience, as i am about to string together, without any
attempt at order, a few odds and ends of things not hitherto mentioned,
but which are either curious in themselves or peculiar to the typees.

there was one singular custom observed in old marheyoâ€™s domestic
establishment, which often excited my surprise. every night, before
retiring, the inmates of the house gathered together on the mats, and
so squatting upon their haunches, after the universal practice of
these islanders, would commence a low, dismal and monotonous chant,
accompanying the voice with the instrumental melody produced by two
small half-rotten sticks tapped slowly together, a pair of which
were held in the hands of each person present. thus would they employ
themselves

 when i reflected that just beyond the
elevations, which bound me in, was the medical relief i needed, and that
although so near, it was impossible for me to avail myself of it, the
thought was misery.

in this wretched situation, every circumstance which evinced the
savage nature of the beings at whose mercy i was, augmented the fearful
apprehensions that consumed me. an occurrence which happened about this
time affected me most powerfully.

i have already mentioned that from the ridge-pole of marheyoâ€™s house
were suspended a number of packages enveloped in tappa. many of these i
had often seen in the hands of the natives, and their contents had been
examined in my presence. but there were three packages hanging
very nearly over the place where i lay, which from their remarkable
appearance had often excited my curiosity. several times i had asked
kory-kory to show me their contents, but my servitor, who, in almost
every other particular had acceded to my wishes, refused to gratify me
in th

urning unexpectedly from the â€˜tiâ€™, my arrival seemed to
throw the inmates of the house into the greatest confusion. they were
seated together on the mats, and by the lines which extended from the
roof to the floor i immediately perceived that the mysterious packages
were for some purpose or another under inspection. the evident alarm
the savages betrayed filled me with forebodings of evil, and with an
uncontrollable desire to penetrate the secret so jealously guarded.
despite the efforts of marheyo and kory-kory to restrain me, i forced
my way into the midst of the circle, and just caught a glimpse of three
human heads, which others of the party were hurriedly enveloping in the
coverings from which they had been taken.

one of the three i distinctly saw. it was in a state of perfect
preservation, and from the slight glimpse i had of it, seemed to have
been subjected to some smoking operation which had reduced it to the
dry, hard, and mummy-like appearance it presented. the two long scalp

the excited throng of islanders, who surrounded the person of the king
and the dead bodies of the enemy, approached the spot where i stood,
brandishing their rude implements of warfare, many of which were bruised
and broken, and uttering continual shouts of triumph. when the crowd
drew up opposite the ti, i set myself to watch their proceedings most
attentively; but scarcely had they halted when my servitor, who had left
my side for an instant, touched my arm and proposed our returning to
marheyoâ€™s house. to this i objected; but, to my surprise, kory-kory
reiterated his request, and with an unusual vehemence of manner. still,
however, i refused to comply, and was retreating before him, as in his
importunity he pressed upon me, when i felt a heavy hand laid upon my
shoulder, and turning round, encountered the bulky form of mow-mow, a
one-eyed chief, who had just detached himself from the crowd below, and
had mounted the rear of the pi-pi upon which we stood. his cheek had
been pierced

by the point of a spear, and the wound imparted a still
more frightful expression to his hideously tattooed face, already
deformed by the loss of an eye. the warrior, without uttering a
syllable, pointed fiercely in the direction of marheyoâ€™s house, while
kory-kory, at the same time presenting his back, desired me to mount.

i declined this offer, but intimated my willingness to withdraw, and
moved slowly along the piazza, wondering what could be the cause of this
unusual treatment. a few minutesâ€™ consideration convinced me that the
savages were about to celebrate some hideous rite in connection with
their peculiar customs, and at which they were determined i should not
be present. i descended from the pi-pi, and attended by k

ges, which now
were deposited upon the ground; but although i had no doubt as to their
contents, still their thick coverings prevented my actually detecting
the form of a human body.

the next morning, shortly after sunrise, the same thundering sounds
which had awakened me from sleep on the second day of the feast of
calabashes, assured me that the savages were on the eve of celebrating
another, and, as i fully believed, a horrible solemnity.

all the inmates of the house, with the exception of marheyo, his son,
and tinor, after assuming their gala dresses, departed in the direction
of the taboo groves.

although i did not anticipate a compliance with my request, still, with
a view of testing the truth of my suspicions, i proposed to kory-kory
that, according to our usual custom in the morning, we should take a
stroll to the ti: he positively refused; and when i renewed the request,
he evinced his determination to prevent my going there; and, to divert
my mind from the subject, he offered to

to the bay, and if they should permanently locate any of their troops
in the valley, the savages could not for any length of time conceal my
existence from them. but what reason had i to suppose that i should be
spared until such an event occurred, an event which might be postponed
by a hundred different contingencies?



chapter thirty-three

the stranger again arrives in the valley--singular interview with
him--attempt to escape--failure--melancholy situation--sympathy of
marheyo

â€˜marnoo, marnoo pemi!â€™ such were the welcome sounds which fell upon my
ear some ten days after the events related in the preceding chapter.
once more the approach of the stranger was heralded, and the
intelligence operated upon me like magic. again i should be able to
converse with him in my own language; and i resolve at all hazards to
concert with him some scheme, however desperate, to rescue me from a
condition that had now become insupportable.

as he drew near, i remembered with many

i should have at least two hours start before the islanders should
discover my absence; for with such facility was any alarm spread through
the valley, and so familiar, of course, were the inhabitants with the
intricacies of the groves, that i could not hope, lame and feeble as i
was, and ignorant of the route, to secure my escape unless i had this
advantage. it was also by night alone that i could hope to accomplish my
object, and then only by adopting the utmost precaution.

the entrance to marheyoâ€™s habitation was through a low narrow opening
in its wicker-work front. this passage, for no conceivable reason that i
could devise, was always closed after the household had retired to rest,
by drawing a heavy slide across it, composed of a dozen or more bits of
wood, ingeniously fastened together by seizings of sinnate. when any of
the inmates chose to go outside, the noise occasioned by the removing of
this rude door awakened every body else; and on more than one occasion
i had remarked th

l fate would
for ever be concealed from them, and that with hope deferred they might
continue to await my return long after my inanimate form had blended
with the dust of the valley--i could not repress a shudder of anguish.

how vividly is impressed upon my mind every minute feature of the scene
which met my view during those long days of suffering and sorrow. at my
request my mats were always spread directly facing the door, opposite
which, and at a little distance, was the hut of boughs that marheyo was
building.

whenever my gentle fayaway and kory-kory, laying themselves down beside
me, would leave me awhile to uninterrupted repose, i took a strange
interest in the slightest movements of the eccentric old warrior. all
alone during the stillness of the tropical mid-day, he would pursue his
quiet work, sitting in the shade and weaving together the leaflets of
his cocoanut branches, or rolling upon his knee the twisted fibres of
bark to form the cords with which he tied together the thatchi

ntreaties, that i might give a joyful welcome to
my long-lost comrade; but now that it was known he had not arrived they
would at once oblige me to turn back.

my anticipations were but too correct. in spite of the resistance i
made, they carried me into a house which was near the spot, and left me
upon the mats. shortly afterwards several of those who had accompanied
me from the ti, detaching themselves from the others, proceeded in
the direction of the sea. those who remained--among whom were marheyo,
mow-mow, kory-kory, and tinor--gathered about the dwelling, and appeared
to be awaiting their return.

this convinced me that strangers--perhaps some of my own countrymen--had
for some cause or other entered the bay. distracted at the idea of their
vicinity, and reckless of the pain which i suffered, i heeded not the
assurances of the islanders, that there were no boats at the beach, but
starting to my feet endeavoured to gain the door. instantly the passage
was blocked up by several men, who

ation, which every moment became more loud and vehement; and to
my unspeakable delight, i perceived that some difference of opinion
had arisen between them; that two parties, in short, were formed, and
consequently that in their divided counsels there was some chance of my
deliverance.

before i had proceeded a hundred yards i was again surrounded by the
savages, who were still in all the heat of argument, and appeared every
moment as if they would come to blows. in the midst of this tumult
old marheyo came to my side, and i shall never forget the benevolent
expression of his countenance. he placed his arm upon my shoulder, and
emphatically pronounced the only two english words i had taught him
â€˜homeâ€™ and â€˜motherâ€™. i at once understood what he meant, and eagerly
expressed my thanks to him. fayaway and kory-kory were by his side, both
weeping violently; and it was not until the old man had twice repeated
the command that his son could bring himself to obey him, and take me

fellow, standing nearly to the waist in the surf, endeavoured to pacify
them; but at length fearful that they would do him some fatal violence,
he beckoned to his comrades to pull in at once, and take him into the
boat.

it was at this agonizing moment, when i thought all hope was ended, that
a new contest arose between the two parties who had accompanied me to
the shore; blows were struck, wounds were given, and blood flowed. in
the interest excited by the fray, every one had left me except marheyo,
kory-kory and poor dear fayaway, who clung to me, sobbing indignantly.
i saw that now or never was the moment. clasping my hands together, i
looked imploringly at marheyo, and move towards the now almost deserted
beach. the tears were in the old manâ€™s eyes, but neither he nor
kory-kory attempted to hold me, and i soon reached the kanaka, who had
anxiously watched my movements; the rowers pulled in as near as they
dared to the edge of the surf; i gave one parting embrace to fayaway,

d speechless with sorrow, and the next instant i found myself
safe in the boat, and karakoee by my side, who told the rowers at once
to give way. marheyo and kory-kory, and a great many of the women,
followed me into the water, and i was determined, as the only mark of
gratitude i could show, to give them the articles which had been brought
as my ransom. i handed the musket to kory-kory, with a rapid gesture
which was equivalent to a â€˜deed of giftâ€™; threw the roll of cotton to
old marheyo, pointing as i did so to poor fayaway, who had retired from
the edge of the water and was sitting down disconsolate on the shingles;
and tumbled the powder-bags out to the nearest young ladies, all of whom
were vastly willing to take them. this distribution did not occupy ten
seconds, and before it was over the boat was under full way; the kanaka
all the while exclaiming loudly against what he considered a useless
throwing away of valuable property.

although it was clear that my movements had

this was a signal of alarm;--for nothing was now heard but shouts
of â€˜happar! happar!â€™--the warriors tilting with their spears and
brandishing them in the air, and the women and boys shouting to each
other, and picking up the stones in the bed of the stream. in a moment
or two mow-mow and two or three other chiefs ran out from the grove, and
the din increased ten fold.

now, thought toby, for a fray; and being unarmed, he besought one of the
young men domiciled with marheyo for the loan of his spear. but he was
refused; the youth roguishly telling him that the weapon was very good
for him (the typee), but that a white man could fight much better with
his fists.

the merry humour of this young wag seemed to be shared by the rest, for
in spite of their warlike cries and gestures, everybody was capering
and laughing, as if it was one of the funniest things in the world to be
awaiting the flight of a score or two of happar javelins from an ambush
in the thickets.

the ascent of the mountain was not very difficult, owing to its being
near to the sea, where the island ridges are comparatively low; the
path, too, was a fine one, so that in a short time all three were
standing on the summit with the two valleys at their feet. the white
cascade marking the green head of the typee valley first caught tobyâ€™s
eye; marheyoâ€™s house could easily be traced by them.

as jimmy led the way along the ridge, toby observed that the valley of
the happars did not extend near so far inland as that of the typees.
this accounted for our mistake in entering the latter valley as we had.

a path leading down from the mountain was soon seen, and, following it,
the party were in a short time fairly in the happar valley.

the bays, and i am going to show
