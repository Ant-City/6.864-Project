irrels  in  the  higher  branches.  all  around, 
me  neighborhood  of roofs,  black-tarred  and  a-framed, 
and in their gutters,  the balls that never came back down 
to earth.  down at the base  of the  tree,  the dog with  two 
names barks  into  the empty air,  and  there  at  the  end of 
the  block,  looking  smaller  still,  our  house  with  its  feet 
tucked  under like a cat. 

this is the tree we chose for the first annual tarzan 

jumping contest.  meme won.  and broke both arms.

downstairs from meme's is a basement apartment that 
meme's  mother  fixed  up  and  rented  to  a  puerto  rican 
family.  louie's  family.  louie  is  the  oldest  in  a  family  of 
little  sisters.  he is  my  brother's friend  really,  but i  know 
he has two cousins and that his t-shirts never stay tucked 
in his  pants. 

louie's  girl  cousin  is  older  than  us.  she  lives  with 
louie's  family  because  her own  family  is  in  puerto rico.

a lamppost. 

marin screamed and we ran down the block to where 
the cop car's siren spun a dizzy blue. the nose of that yellow 
cadillac was  all  pleated  like  an alligator's, and except for 
a  bloody  lip  and  a  bruised  forehead,  louie's  cousin  was 
okay. they put handcuffs on him and put him in the back­
seat of the cop

louie has another cousin.  we only saw  him once, but 
it was  important.  we  were  playing  volleyball  in  the alley 
when  he  drove  up  in  this  great  big  yellow  cadillac  with 
whitewalls  and  a  yellow  scarf  tied  around  the  mirror. 
louie's cousin had his arm out the window.  he honked a 
couple of times and a lot of faces  looked out from louie's 
back  window  and  then  a  lot of people came out-louie, 
marin and all  the little sisters. 

everybody looked inside the car and asked where he 
got it.  there were white  rugs and white leather seats.  we 
all asked for a ride and asked where he got it. louie's cousin 
said  get in. 

we each had to sit with one of louie's little sisters on 
our lap, but that was okay. the seats w

a sofa,  and there was  a little white cat in the back window 
whose  eyes  lit  up  when  the  car stopped  or  turned.  the 
windows didn't roll  up like in ordinary cars.  instead there 
was a button that did it for you automatically. we rode up 
the alley and around the block six times, but louie's cousin 
said  he was  going to make us  walk  home if we  didn't stop 
playing with the windows or touching the fm  radio. 

the seventh  time  we  drove  into  the alley  we  heard 
sirens ... real quiet at first, but then louder. louie's cousin 
stopped the car right where we  were and said, everybody 
out of the  car.  then he  took off flooring  that car into  a 
yellow blur. we hardly had time to think when the cop car 
pulled  in  the  alley  going just as  fast.  we  saw  the  yellow

didn't  get  a job yet,  but she's  saving  the  money  she  gets 
from  selling avon and  taking care of her cousins. 

marin says that if she stays here next year, she's going 
to  get  a  real job downtown  because  that's  where  the  best 
jobs are,  since  you  always  get to look  beautiful and get to 
wear nice clothes and can meet someone in the subway who 
might  marry  you  and  take  you  to  live  in  a  big  house  far 
away.
