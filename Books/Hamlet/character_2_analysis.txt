Gertrude

Few Shakespearean characters have caused as much uncertainty
as Gertrude, the beautiful Queen of Denmark. The play seems to raise more
questions about Gertrude than it answers, including: Was she involved
with Claudius before the death of her husband? Did she love her
husband? Did she know about Claudius's plan to commit the murder?
Did she love Claudius, or did she marry him simply to keep her high
station in Denmark? Does she believe Hamlet when he insists that
he is not mad, or does she pretend to believe him simply to protect
herself? Does she intentionally betray Hamlet to Claudius, or does
she believe that she is protecting her son's secret?
These questions can be answered in numerous ways, depending upon
one's reading of the play. The Gertrude who does emerge clearly
in Hamlet is a woman defined by her desire for
station and affection, as well as by her tendency to use men to
fulfill her instinct for self-preservation--which, of course, makes
her extremely dependent upon the men in her life. Hamlet's most
famous comment about Gertrude is his furious condemnation of women
in general: "Frailty, thy name is woman!" (I.ii.146).
This comment is as much indicative of Hamlet's agonized state of
mind as of anything else, but to a great extent Gertrude does seem
morally frail. She never exhibits the ability to think critically
about her situation, but seems merely to move instinctively toward
seemingly safe choices, as when she immediately runs to Claudius
after her confrontation with Hamlet. She is at her best in social
situations (I.ii and V.ii), when her natural grace and charm seem
to indicate a rich, rounded personality. At times it seems that
her grace and charm are her only characteristics,
and her reliance on men appears to be her sole way of capitalizing
on her abilities.
