[CHARACTER] - 
 a socially awkward but generous-hearted landowner
who, along with anna, is the co-protagonist of the novel. whereas
anna's pursuit of love ends in tragedy, levin's long courtship of
kitty shcherbatskaya ultimately ends in a happy marriage. levin
is intellectual and philosophical but applies his thinking to practical
matters such as agriculture. he aims to be sincere and productive
in whatever he does, and resigns from his post in local government
because he sees it as useless and bureaucratic. levin is a figurehead
in the novel for tolstoy himself, who modeled levin and kitty's
courtship on his own marriage. levin's declaration of faith at the
end of the novel sums up tolstoy's own convictions, marking the start
of the deeply religious phase of tolstoy's life that followed his
completion of anna karenina.
