he took a chair in the same row as winston, a couple of places away.
a small, sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to winston was
between them. the girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind.

the next moment a hideous, grinding speech, as of some monstrous machine
running without oil, burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room.
it was a noise that set one's teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the
back of one's neck. the hate had started.

as usual, the face of emmanuel goldstein, the enemy of the people, had
flashed on to the screen. there were hisses here and there among the
audience. the little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and
disgust. goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago
(how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading
figures of the party, almost on a level with big brother himself, and
then had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been condemned
to death, and had mysteriously escaped and d

stuff looked almost black, but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby.
it had a sour-sweet smell. he saw julia pick up her glass and sniff at
it with frank curiosity.

had read and dreamed about. like the glass paperweight or mr charrington's
half-remembered rhymes, it belonged to the vanished, romantic past, the

he had always thought of wine as having an intensely sweet taste, like
that of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxicating effect. actually,
when he came to swallow it, the stuff was distinctly disappoi

sat down in the sluttish armchair and undid the straps of the brief-case.

a heavy black volume, amateurishly bound, with no name or title on the
cover. the print also looked slightly irregular. the pages were worn at
the edges, and fell apart, easily, as though the book had passed through

throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the neolithic age,
there have been three kinds of people in the world, the high, the middle,
and the low. they have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne
countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their
attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the
essential structure of society has never altered. even after enormous
upheavals an
