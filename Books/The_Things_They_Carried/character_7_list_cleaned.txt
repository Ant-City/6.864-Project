[CHARACTER] - 
                 a
childish and careless member of the alpha company who is killed
when he steps on a rigged mortar round. though o'brien does
not particularly like lemon, lemon's death is something o'brien continually
contemplates with sadness and regret. the preventability of his
death and the irrational fears of his life--as when a dentist visits
the company--point to the immaturity of many young american soldiers
in vietnam.
