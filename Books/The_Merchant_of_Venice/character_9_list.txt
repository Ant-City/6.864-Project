The prince of Morocco - 
A Moorish prince who seeks Portia's hand in marriage.
The prince of Morocco asks Portia to ignore his dark countenance
and seeks to win her by picking one of the three caskets. Certain
that the caskets reflect Portia's beauty and stature, the prince
of Morocco picks the gold chest, which proves to be incorrect.
