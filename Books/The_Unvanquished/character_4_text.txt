learning to be a lawyer or nothing. you just save your money and buy
you a handful of printed letterheads--it don't matter much what's on them, i reckon--and
you hand them to your grandmaw here and just ask her to give you the job of counting
the money when hit comes in."

he looked at granny again. "when kernel sartoris left here, he told me to look out
for you against general grant and them. what i wonder is, if somebody hadn't better tell
abe lincoln to look out for general grant against miz rosa millard. i bid you one and all
good night."

he went out. granny looked at the fire, the tin can in her hand. but it didn't have
any six thousand dollars in it. it didn't have a thousand dollars in it. ab snopes knew that,
only i don't suppose that it was possible for him to believe it. then she got up; she looked at
me, quiet. she didn't look sick; that wasn't it. "i reckon it's bedtime," she said. she went
beyond the quilt; it came back and hung straight down from the rafter, and i heard the

forged order! we have got you this time! we knew you'd turn up again. orders went out to
the whole department to watch for you a month ago! that damn newberry had his copy
in his pocket while you were talking to him." he cursed colonel newberry now. "they ought
to let you go free and court-martial him! where's the nigger boy and the mules, mrs.
plurella harris?"

"i don't know what you are talking about," granny said. "i have no mules except this
team i am driving. and my name is rosa millard. i am on my way home beyond jefferson."

the officer began to laugh; he sat on the horse, laughing. "so that's your real name,
hey? well, well, well. so you have begun to tell the truth at last. come now, tell me where
those mules are, and tell me where the others you have stolen from us are hid."

then ringo hollered. he and ab snopes and the mules had turned off into the
woods on the right side of the road, but when he hollered now he was on the left side.
"heyo the road!" he hollered. "one b

once; he just stood there, looking at her. "confound it, i don't mean promise. if i just knew
what you believed in, held--"

he cursed again, not loud and not at anybody or anything. "listen. i don't say
promise; i never mentioned the word. but i have a family; i am a poor man; i have no
grandmother. and if in about four months the auditor should find a warrant in the records
for a thousand dollars to mrs. rosa millard, i would have to make it good. do you see?"

"yes," granny said. "you need not worry." then they were gone. granny and ringo
and joby and i stood there and watched them drive the mules up across the pasture and
out of sight. we had forgot about ab snopes until he said, "well, hit looks like . . . that's all
they are to hit. but you still got that ere hundred-odd that are out on receipt, provided

strong and quiet and not loud:

where she has gone. and i don't reckon that anybody that ever knew her would want to
insult her by telling her to rest anywhere in peace. and i reckon that god has already seen
to it that there are men, women and children, black, white, yellow or red, waiting for her,
to tend and worry over. and so you folks go home. some of you ain't come far, and you
came that distance in carriages with tops. but most of you didn't, and it's by the grace of
rosa millard that you didn't come on foot. i'm talking to you. you have wood to cut and
split, at least. and what do you reckon rosa millard would say about you all standing
around here, keeping old folks and children out here in the rain?"

came back, and some others did--i don't remember who--and then, when i thought they
had all gone, i looked around, and there was uncle buck. he came up to us with one
elbow jammed into his side and his beard drawn over to one side like it was another arm,

then we came in sight of the house. i rode up to uncle buck. "give me the pistol," i said.

and that nigger stay back and let me do this. i'm going to find out which a way to start
hunting. get back, now."


two hands on the man that shot rosa millard, don't you?" he looked at me. i sat there on
the mule in the slow gray cold rain, in the dying daylight. maybe it was the cold. i didn't
feel cold, but i could feel my bones jerking and shaking. "and then what you going to do
with him?" uncle buck said. he was almost whispering now. "hey? hey?"
"yes," i said. "yes."

"yes. that's what. now you and ringo stay back. i'll do this."

happen to him would be for us not to do anything to him at all. because he quit jerking his
arms; he even quit lying; for a minute his eyes and his mouth were telling the same thing.

"i made a mistake," he said. "i admit hit. i reckon everybody does. the question is,
what are you fellows going to do about hit?"

"yes," uncle buck said. "everybody makes mistakes. your trouble is, you make too
many. because mistakes are bad. look at rosa millard. she just made one, and look at
her. and you have made two."

at uncle buck to hush. father's hand was hard; i could see his face beyond drusilla and i
was trying to say, "father, father," while she was holding me and ringo with the rain smell
of her hair all around us, and uncle buck hollering and joby looking at uncle buck with his
mouth open and his eyes round.

"yes, by godfrey! not only tracked him down and caught him but brought back
the actual proof of it to where rosa millard could rest quiet." "the which?" joby hollered.
"fotch back the which?" "hush! hush!" drusilla said. "that's all done, all finished. you, uncle
buck!"

and drusilla rode up to that old compress, the first thing we see was that murdering
scoundrel pegged out on the door to it like a coon hide, all except the right hand. 'and if
anybody wants to see that, too,' i told john sartoris, 'just let them ride into jefferson and
look on rosa millard's grave!' ain't i told you he is john sartoris' boy? hey
