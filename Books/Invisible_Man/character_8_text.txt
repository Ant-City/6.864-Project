ssed we could look through to the fields beyond. i stopped
the car at his excited command in front of a house set off from the rest.
"is that a log cabin?"
it was an old cabin with its chinks filled with chalk-white clay, with
bright new shingles patching its roof. suddenly i was sorry that i had
blundered down this road. i recognized the place as soon as i saw the group
of children in stiff new overalls who played near a rickety fence.
"yes, sir. it is a log cabin," i said.
it was the cabin of jim trueblood, a sharecropper who had brought
disgrace upon the black community. several months before he had caused
quite a bit of outrage up at the school, and now his name was never
mentioned above a whisper. even before that he had seldom come near the
campus but had been well liked as a hard worker who took good care of his
family's needs, and as one who told the old stories with a sense of humor
and a magic that made them come alive. he was also a good tenor singer,
and sometimes when special white gue

sts visited the school he was brought
up along with the members of a country quartet to sing what the officials
called "their primitive spirituals" when we assembled in the chapel on sunday
evenings. we were embarrassed by the earthy harmonies they sang, but since
the visitors were awed we dared not laugh at the crude, high, plaintively
animal sounds jim trueblood made as he led the quartet. that had all
passed now with his disgrace, and what on the part of the school officials
had been an attitude of contempt blunted by tolerance, had now become a
contempt sharpened by hate. i didn't understand in those pre-invisible days
that their hate, and mine too, was charged with fear. how all of us at the
college hated the black-belt people, the "peasants," during those days! we
were trying to lift them up and they, like trueblood, did everything it seemed

becoming soft and negative, their eyes bland and deceptive. they were
crouching behind their eyes waiting for him to speak -- just as i recognized
that i was trembling behind my own. up close i saw what i had not seen
from the car: the man had a scar on his right cheek, as though he had been
hit in the face with a sledge. the wound was raw and moist and from time
to time he lifted his handkerchief to fan away the gnats.
"i, i --" mr. norton stammered, "i must talk with you!"
"all right, suh," jim trueblood said without surprise and waited.
"is it true . . . i mean did you?"
"suh?" trueblood asked, as i looked away.
"you have survived," he blurted. "but is it true . . .?"
"suh?" the farmer said, his brow wrinkling with bewilderment.
"i'm sorry, sir," i said, "but i don't think he understands you."
he ignored me, staring into trueblood's face as though reading a
message there which i could not perceive.
"you did and are unharmed!" he shouted, his blue eyes blazing into
the black face with something

ng a banknote. "please take this and buy the
children some toys for me."
trueblood's mouth fell agape, his eyes widened and filled with
moisture as he took the bill between trembling fingers. it was a
hundred-dollar bill.
"i'm ready, young man," mr. norton said, his voice a whisper.
i went before him to the car and opened the door. he stumbled a
bit climbing in and i gave him my arm. his face was still chalk white.
"drive me away from here," he said in a sudden frenzy. "away!"
"yes, sir."
i saw jim trueblood wave as i threw the car into gear. "you
bastard," i said under my breath. "you no-good bastard! you get a
hundred-dollar bill!"
when i had turned the car and started back i saw him still standing
in the same place.
suddenly mr. norton touched me on the shoulder. "i must have a
stimulant, young man. a little whiskey."
"yes, sir. are you all right, sir?"
"a little faint, but a stimulant . . ."
his voice trailed off. something cold formed within my chest. if
anything happened to him dr. bledsoe wo
