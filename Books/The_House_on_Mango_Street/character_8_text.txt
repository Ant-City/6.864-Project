it was  my  great-grandmother's  name  and  now  it  is 
mine.  she  was  a  horse  woman  too,  born  like  me  in  the 
chinese  year  of the  horse-which  is  supposed  to  be  bad 
luck  if you're  born  female-but  i  think  this  is  a  chinese 
lie  because the chinese, like  the mexicans, don't like their 
women  strong.

they  are  wearing  shiny  sunday  shoes  without  socks.  it 
makes their bald ankles all  red, but i like them. especially 
the  big one who  laughs with all  her teeth.  i  like  her even 
though she lets  the little one do all  the talking. 

five  dollars,  the little one says,  only  five. 
cathy  is  tugging  my  arm and  i  know  whatever  i do 

! 

next will  make her mad  forever. 

wait  a  minute,  i  say,  and  run  inside  to  get the  five 
dollars.  i  have three dollars saved and i  take two of nen­
ny's.  she's not home, but i'm sure she'll  he glad  when she 
finds  out we  own  a  bike.  when  i  get back,  cathy is  gone 
like  i  knew she would be, but i don't care.  i  have two new 
friends  and  a  bike too. 

my name is lucy, the big one says. this here is  rachel

i  don't  tell  them about  nenny just yet.  it's  too com­

plicated.  especially since rachel almost  put out lucy's eye 
about  who was  going to  get  to ride  it  first.  but  finally  we 
agree to  ride  it  together.  why  not? 

because  lucy  has  long  lew;  she  pedals.  i  sit  on  the 

our good day 

if you  give  me  five  dollars  i  will  be your friend  for­

ever.  that's what the little one tells  me. 

five  dollars  is  cheap  since  i  don't  have  any  friends 

except cathy who is  only  my  friend  till  tuesday. 

five  dollars,  five  dollars. 
she  is  trying  to get  somehody  to  chip in  so  they can 
huy a  hicycle from this kid  named tito. they already have 
ten dollars and all  they  need  is  five  more. 

only five  dollars, she says. 
don', talk to them, says cathy. can't you see they smell 

like a  hroom. 

but  i  like  them.  their clothes  are  crooked  and  old.

and then i don't know why, but i have to turn around 
and pretend i don't care about the box so nenny won't see 
how  stupid  i  am.  but nenny,  who  is  stupider, already  is 
asking how  much and  i can see her fingers  going for the 
quarters in  her pants pocket.

mettle ortiz. 

meme ortiz moved into cathy's house after her family 
moved away. his name isn't really meme. his name isjuan. 
but when we asked him what his name was he said meme, 
and that's what everybody calls  him except his  mother. 

meme has a dog with gray eyes, a sheepdog with two 
names, one in english and one in spanish. the dog is big, 
like  a  man dressed  in  a  dog suit,  and  runs the same way 
its owner does, clumsy and wild and with the limbs flopping 
allover the place like  untied shoes.

around the back is  a yard,  mostly dirt, and a greasy
