Falstaff - 
      Falstaff is a knight, but he is also a scoundrel and occasionally a thief. In 
                        Henry IV, Part I
                    , he was a drinking buddy of the young Prince Henry. Falstaff is boisterous, lively, cowardly, funny, and mischievous; he is one of Shakespeare's most beloved creations, appearing in several of his plays. In Wives, outside his element in the countryside, Falstaff thinks he can get away with seducing married women in order to gain access to their husbands' cash. Hence he launches a plan to seduce Mistress Page and Mistress Ford. However, they are cleverer than he is and, on three separate occasions, cause him to be humiliated, beaten, or dunked in a river.
