  charles. good morrow to your worship.

  oliver. good monsieur charles! what's the new news at the new
    court?

  charles. there's no news at the court, sir, but the old news; that
    is, the old duke is banished by his younger brother the new duke;
    and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary
    exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;
    therefore he gives them good leave to wander.

  oliver. can you tell if rosalind, the duke's daughter, be banished
    with her father?

  charles. o, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves her,
    being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have
    followed her exile, or have died to stay behind her. she is at
    the court, and no less beloved of her uncle than his own
    daughter; and never two ladies loved as they do.

  oliver. where will the old duke live?

  charles. they say he is already in the forest of arden, and a many

  celia. i pray thee, rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.

  rosalind. dear celia, i show more mirth than i am mistress of; and
    would you yet i were merrier? unless you could teach me to forget
    a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any
    extraordinary pleasure.

  celia. herein i see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that i
    love thee. if my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy
    uncle, the duke my father, so thou hadst been

  rosalind. well, i will forget the condition of my estate, to
    rejoice in yours.

  celia. you know my father hath no child but i, nor none is like to
    have; and, truly, when he dies thou shalt be his heir; for what
    he hath taken away from thy father perforce, i will render thee
    again in affection. by mine honour, i will; and when i break that
    oath, let me turn monster; therefore, my sweet rose, my dear
    rose, be merry.

    let me see; what think you of falling in love?

  celia. marry, i prithee, do, to make sport withal; but love no man
    in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety
    of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again.

  rosalind. what shall be our sport, then?

  celia. let us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from her
    wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.

  rosalind. i would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily
    misplaced; and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her
    gifts to women.

  celia. 'tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes
    honest; and those that she makes honest she makes very
    ill-favouredly.

  rosalind. nay; now thou goest from fortune's office to nature's:
    fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of
    nature.

  celia. no; when nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by
    fortune fall into the fire? though nature hath given us wit to
    flout at fortune, hath not fortune sent in this fool to cut off
    the argument?

  rosalind. indeed, there is fortune too hard for nature, when
    fortune makes nature's natural the cutter-off of nature's wit.

  celia. peradventure this is not fortune's work neither, but
    nature's, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of
    such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for
    always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits.
    how now, wit! whither wander you?

  touchstone. mistress, you must come away to your father.

elia. were you made the messenger?

  touchstone. no, by mine honour; but i was bid to come for you.

  rosalind. where learned you that oath, fool?

  touchstone. of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were
    good pancakes, and swore by his honour the mustard was naught.
    now i'll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard
    was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.

  celia. how prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge?

  rosalind. ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.

  touchstone. stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear
    by your beards that i am a knave.

  celia. by our beards, if we had them, thou art.

  touchstone. by my knavery, if i had it, then i were. but if you
    swear by that that not, you are not forsworn; no more was this
    knight, swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he
    had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or
    that mustard.

 your father, loves.

  celia. my father's love is enough to honour him. enough, speak no
    more of him; you'll be whipt for taxation one of these days.

  touchstone. the more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise
    men do foolishly.

  celia. by my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit that
    fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have
    makes a great show. here comes monsieur le beau.

                           enter le beau

    monsieur le beau. what's the news?

  le beau. the eldest of the three wrestled with charles, the duke's
    wrestler; which charles in a moment threw him, and broke three of
    his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him. so he serv'd
    the second, and so the third. yonder they lie; the poor old man,
    their father, making such pitiful dole over them that all the

  celia. that's no matter; the feet might bear the verses.

  rosalind. ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves
    without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.

  celia. but didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be
    hang'd and carved upon these trees?

  rosalind. i was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you
    came; for look here what i found on a palm-tree. i was never so

    christen'd.

  jaques. what stature is she of?

  orlando. just as high as my heart.

  jaques. you are full of pretty answers. have you not been

  orlando. very well; what would you?

  rosalind. i pray you, what is't o'clock?

  orlando. you should ask me what time o' day; there's no clock in
    the forest.

  rosalind. then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing
    every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot
    of time as well as a clock.

 ___________________________
 
 and why not the swift foot of time? had not that been as
    proper?

  rosalind. by no means, sir. time travels in divers paces with
    divers persons. i'll tell you who time ambles withal, who time
    trots withal, who time gallops withal, and who he stands still
    withal.

  orlando. i prithee, who doth he trot withal?

  rosalind. marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
    contract of her marriage and the day it is solemniz'd; if the
    interim be but a se'nnight, time's pace is so hard that it seems
    the length of seven year.

  orlando. who ambles time withal?

  rosalind. with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that hath
    not the gout; for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study,
    and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain; the one
    lacking the burden of lean a

nd wasteful learning, the other
    knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. these time ambles
    withal.

  orlando. who doth he gallop withal?

  rosalind. with a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly
    as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.

  orlando. who stays it still withal?

  rosalind. with lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term
    and term, and then they perceive not how time moves.

  orlando. where dwell you, pretty youth?

  rosalind. with this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of
    the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.

  orlando. are you native of this place?

  rosalind. as the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.

alind. i have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious
    uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland
    man; one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love.
    i have heard him read many lectures against it; and i thank god i
    am not a woman, to be touch'd with so many giddy offences as he
    hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal.

  orlando. can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid
    to the charge of women?

  rosalind. there were none principal; they were all like one another
    as halfpence are; every one fault seeming monstrous till his
    fellow-fault came to match it.

  orlando. i prithee recount some of them.

  rosalind. no; i will not cast away my physic but on those that are
    sick. there is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young
    plants with carving 'rosalind' on their barks; hangs odes upon
    hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the
    name of rosal

ind. if i could meet that fancy-monger, i would give
    him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love
    upon him.

  orlando. i am he that is so love-shak'd; i pray you tell me your
    remedy.

  rosalind. there is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me
    how to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes i am sure you
    are not prisoner.

  orlando. what were his marks?

  rosalind. a lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,
    which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not;
    a beard neglected, which you have not; but i pardon you for that,
    for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue.
    then your hose should be ungarter'd, your bonnet unbanded, your
    sleeve unbutton'd, your shoe untied, and every thing about you
    demonstrating a careless desolation. but you are no such man; you
    are rather point-

    than seeming the lover of any other.

  orlando. fair youth, i would i could make thee believe i love.

  rosalind. me believe it! you may as soon make her that you love
    believe it; which, i warrant, she is apter to do than to confess
    she does. that is one of the points in the which women still give
    the lie to their consciences. but, in good sooth, are you he that
    hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind is so admired?

  orlando. i swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of rosalind, i
    am that he, that unfortunate he.

  rosalind. but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?

  orlando. neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.

  rosalind. love is merely a madness; and, i tell you, deserves as
    well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why
    they are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so
    ordinary that the whippers are in love too

. yet i profess curing
    it by counsel.

  orlando. did you ever cure any so?

  rosalind. yes, one; and in this manner. he was to imagine me his
    love, his mistress; and i set him every day to woo me; at which
    time would i, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate,
    changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish,
    shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every
    passion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and
    women are for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like
    him, now loathe him; then en

tertain him, then forswear him; now
    weep for him, then spit at him; that i drave my suitor from his
    mad humour of love to a living humour of madness; which was, to
    forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook
    merely monastic. and thus i cur'd him; and this way will i take
    upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart,
    that there shall not be one spot of love in 't.

  orlando. i would not be cured, youth.

  rosalind. i would cure you, if you would but call me rosalind, and
    come every day to my cote and woo me.

  orlando. now, by the faith of my love, i will. tell me where it is.

  rosalind. go with me to it, and i'll show it you; and, by the way,
    you shall tell me where in the forest you live. will you go?

  celia. he hath bought a pair of cast lips of diana. a nun of
    winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously; the very ice of
    chastity is in them.

  rosalind. but why did he swear he would come this morning, and
    comes not?

  celia. nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.

  rosalind. do you think so?

  celia. yes; i think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but
    for his verity in love, i do think him as concave as covered
    goblet or a worm-eaten nut.

  rosalind. not true in love?

  celia. yes, when he is in; but i think he is not in.

  rosalind. you have heard him swear downright he was.

    he; so he laugh'd and let me go. but what talk we of fathers when
    there is such a man as orlando?

  celia. o, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses, speaks brave
    words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite

    fellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than

    travels; in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous
    sadness.

  rosalind. a traveller! by my faith, you have great reason to be
    sad. i fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's; then
    to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and
    poor hands.

    out of love with your nativity, and almost chide god for making
    you that countenance you are; or i will scarce think you have

    of him that cupid hath clapp'd him o' th' shoulder, but i'll
    warrant him heart-whole.

  rosalind. nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. i had
    as lief be woo'd of a snail.

  orlando. of a snail!

  rosalind. ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries
    his house on his head- a better jointure, i think, than you make
    a woman; besides, he brings his destiny with him.

  orlando. what's that?

  rosalind. why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to
    your wives for; but he comes armed in his fortune, and prevents
    the slander of his wife.

    and like enough to consent. what would you say to me now, an i
    were your very very rosalind?

  orlando. i would kiss before i spoke.

  rosalind. nay, you were better speak first; and when you were
    gravell'd for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss.
    very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for
    lovers lacking- god warn us!- matter, the cleanliest shift is to
    kiss.

  orlando. how if the kiss be denied?

  rosalind. then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new
    matter.

  orlando. who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?

  orlando. i take some joy to say you are, because i would be talking
    of her.

  rosalind. well, in her person, i say i will not have you.

  orlando. then, in mine own person, i die.

  rosalind. no, faith, die by attorney. the poor world is almost six
    thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man
    died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause. troilus had
    his brains dash'd out with a grecian club; yet he did what he
    could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love.

  rosalind. i might ask you for your commission; but- i do take thee,
    orlando, for my husband. there's a girl goes before the priest;

    an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. i will weep for

    and found it was his brother, his elder brother.

  celia. o, i have heard him speak of that same brother;
    and he did render him the most unnatural
    that liv'd amongst men.

    for well i know he was unnatural.

  rosalind. but, to orlando: did he leave him there,

  oliver. twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;
    but kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
    and nature, stronger than his just occasion,
    made him give battle to the lioness,
    who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling
