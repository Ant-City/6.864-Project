ion, that
under their tuition the king and queen had imbibed proper notions of
their elevated station, and on all ceremonious occasions conducted
themselves with suitable dignity. accordingly, preparations were made to
give their majesties a reception on board in a style corresponding with
their rank.

one bright afternoon, a gig, gaily bedizened with streamers, was
observed to shove off from the side of one of the french frigates, and
pull directly for our gangway. in the stern sheets reclined mowanna and
his consort. as they approached, we paid them all the honours due to
royalty;--manning our yards, firing a salute, and making a prodigious
hubbub.

they ascended the accommodation ladder, were greeted by the commodore,
hat in hand, and passing along the quarter-deck, the marine guard
presented arms, while the band struck up ‘the king of the cannibal
islands’. so far all went well. the french officers grimaced and smiled
in exceedingly high spirits, wonderfully pleased with the discreet

our wicked propensities so much after all; and were civilization itself
to be estimated by some of its results, it would seem perhaps better for
what we call the barbarous part of the world to remain unchanged.

one example of the shameless subterfuges under which the french stand
prepared to defend whatever cruelties they may hereafter think fit to
commit in bringing the marquesan natives into subjection is well worthy
of being recorded. on some flimsy pretext or other mowanna, the king of
nukuheva, whom the invaders by extravagant presents had cajoled over to
their interests, and moved about like a mere puppet, has been set up
as the rightful sovereign of the entire island--the alleged ruler by
prescription of various clans, who for ages perhaps have treated with
each other as separate nations. to reinstate this much-injured prince in
the assumed dignities of his ancestors, the disinterested strangers have
come all the way from france: they are determined that his t

be acknowledged. if any tribe shall refuse to recognize the authority
of the french, by bowing down to the laced chapeau of mowanna, let them
abide the consequences of their obstinacy. under cover of a similar
pretence, have the outrages and massacres at tahiti the beautiful, the
queen of the south seas, been perpetrated.

on this buccaneering expedition, rear admiral du petit thouars, leaving
the rest of his squadron at the marquesas,--which had then been occupied
by his forces about five months--set sail for the doomed island in
the reine blanche frigate. on his arrival, as an indemnity for alleged
insults offered to the

water, and close under the shadow of the happar mountain, where a path
was seen winding out of sight through a gorge.

no sign of a boat, however, was beheld, nothing but a tumultuous crowd
of men and women, and some one in their midst, earnestly talking to
them. as my comrade advanced, this person came forward and proved to
be no stranger. he was an old grizzled sailor, whom toby and myself had
frequently seen in nukuheva, where he lived an easy devil-may-care life
in the household of mowanna the king, going by the name of ‘jimmy’.
in fact he was the royal favourite, and had a good deal to say in his
master’s councils. he wore a manilla hat and a sort of tappa morning
gown, sufficiently loose and negligent to show the verse of a song
tattooed upon his chest, and a variety of spirited cuts by native
artists in other parts of his body. he sported a fishing rod in his
hand, and carried a sooty old pipe slung about his neck.

but to return to toby. the moment he saw the old rover on the beach, he
ran up to him, the natives following after, and forming a circle round
them.

after welcoming him to the shore, jimmy went on to tell him how that he
knew all about our having run away from the ship, and being among the
typees. indeed, he had been urged by mowanna to come over to the valley,
and after visiting his friends there, to bring us back with him, his
royal master being exceedingly anxious to share with him the reward
which had been held out for our capture. he, however, assured toby that
he had indignantly spurned the offer.

all this astonished my comrade not a little, as neither of us had
entertained the least idea that any white man ever visited the typees
sociably. but jimmy told him that such was the case nevertheless,

on gaining the heights once more, their way led for a time along several
ridges covered with enormous ferns. at last they entered upon a wooded
tract, and here they overtook a party of nukuheva natives, well armed,
and carrying bundles of long poles. jimmy seemed to know them all very
well, and stopped for a while, and had a talk about the ‘wee-wees’, as
the people of nukuheva call the monsieurs.

the party with the poles were king mowanna’s men, and by his orders they
had been gathering them in the ravines for his allies the french.

leaving these fellows to trudge on with their loads, toby and his
companions now pushed forward again, as the sun was already low in the
west. they came upon the valleys of nukuheva on one side of the bay,
where the highlands slope off into the sea. the men-of-war were still
lying in the harbour, and as toby looked down upon them, the strange
events which had happened so recently, seemed all a dre
