[CHARACTER] - 
 essayist, poet, and the leading figure of transcendentalism.
emerson became a mentor to thoreau after they met in 1837.
emerson played a significant role in the creation of walden by
allowing thoreau to live and build on his property near walden pond.
there is an appropriate symbolism in this construction site, since
philosophically thoreau was building on the transcendentalist foundation
already prepared by emerson. the influence of emerson's ideas, especially
the doctrine of self-reliance that sees the human soul and mind
as the origin of the reality it inhabits, pervades thoreau's work.
however, whereas thoreau retreated to his own private world, emerson assumed
a prominent role in public life, making extended overseas lecture
tours to promote the view expressed in his renowned essays. the
two often disagreed on the necessity of adhering to some public conventions,
and the heated tensions between the two may perhaps be felt in the
minimal attention emerson receives in walden. thoreau
utterly fails to mention that emerson owns the land, despite his
tedious detailing of less significant facts, and when emerson visits,
in the guise of the unnamed "old immortal," thoreau treats him rather
indifferently.
