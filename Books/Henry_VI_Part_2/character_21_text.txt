ose floud begins to flowe within mine eyes;
my body round engyrt with miserie:
for what's more miserable then discontent?
ah vnckle humfrey, in thy face i see
the map of honor, truth, and loyaltie:
and yet, good humfrey, is the houre to come,
that ere i prou'd thee false, or fear'd thy faith.
what lowring starre now enuies thy estate?
that these great lords, and margaret our queene,
doe seeke subuersion of thy harmelesse life.
thou neuer didst them wrong, nor no man wrong:
and as the butcher takes away the calfe,
and binds the wretch, and beats it when it strayes,
bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house;
euen so remorselesse haue they borne him hence:
and as the damme runnes lowing vp and downe,
looking the way her harmelesse young one went,
and can doe naught but wayle her darlings losse;
euen so my selfe bewayles good glosters case
with sad vnhelpefull teares, and with dimn'd eyes;
looke after him, and cannot doe him good:
so mightie are his vowed enemies.
his fortune
