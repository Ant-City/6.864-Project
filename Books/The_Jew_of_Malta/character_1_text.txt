     see the simplicity of these base slaves,
     who, for the villains have no wit themselves,
     think me to be a senseless lump of clay,
     that will with every water wash to dirt!
     no, barabas is born to better chance,
     and fram'd of finer mould than common men,
     that measure naught but by the present time.
     a reaching thought will search his deepest wits,
     and cast with cunning for the time to come;
     for evils are apt to happen every day.

     what, woman! moan not for a little loss;
     thy father has enough in store for thee.

     and, urg'd thereto with my afflictions,
     with fierce exclaims run to the senate-house,

     be silent, daughter; sufferance breeds ease,
     and time may yield us an occasion,
     which on the sudden cannot serve the turn.
     besides, my girl, think me not all so fond [44]
     as negligently to forgo so much
     without provision for thyself and me:

     barabas. in my house, my girl.

     abigail. then shall they ne'er be seen of barabas;
     for they have seiz'd upon thy house and wares.

     barabas. but they will give me leave once more, i trow,
     to go into my house.

     abigail. that may they not;
     for there i left the governor placing nuns,
     displacing me; and of thy house they mean
     to make a nunnery, where none but their own sect [46]
     must enter in; men generally barr'd.

     barabas. my gold, my gold, and all my wealth is gone!--
     you partial heavens, have i deserv'd this plague?
     what, will you thus oppose me, luckless stars,
     to make me desperate in my poverty?

     and, since you leave me in the ocean thus
     to sink or swim, and put me to my shifts,
     i'll rouse my senses, and awake myself.--
     daughter, i have it:  thou perceiv'st the plight
     wherein these christians have oppressed me:
     be rul'd by me, for in extremity
     we ought to make bar of no policy.

     abigail. father, whate'er it be, to injure them
     that have so manifestly wronged us,
     what will not abigail attempt?

     barabas. why, so.
     then thus:  thou told'st me they have turn'd my house
     into a nunnery, and some nuns are there?

     abigail. i did.

     barabas. then, abigail, there must my girl
     entreat the abbess to be entertain'd.

     abigail. how! as a nun?

     barabas. ay, daughter; for religion
     hides many mischiefs from suspicion.

     abigail. ay, but, f

     barabas. let 'em suspect; but be thou so precise
     as they may think it done of holiness:
     entreat 'em fair, and give them friendly speech,
     and seem to them as if thy sins were great,
     till thou hast gotten to be entertain'd.

     abigail. thus, father, shall i much dissemble.

     barabas. tush!
     as good dissemble that thou never mean'st,
     as first mean truth and then dissemble it:
     a counterfeit profession is better
     than unseen hypocrisy.

     abigail. well, father, say i be entertain'd,
     what then shall follow?

     barabas. this shall follow then.
     there have i hid, close underneath the plank
     that runs along the upper-chamber floor,
     the gold and jewels which i kept for thee:--

     for i will seem offended with thee for't:
     be close, my girl, for this must fetch my gold.

     abigail. grave abbess, and you happy virgins' guide,
     pity the state of a distressed maid!

     abbess. what art thou, daughter?

     abigail. the hopeless daughter of a hapless jew,
     the jew of malta, wretched barabas,
     sometimes [49] the owner of a goodly house,
     which they have now turn'd to a nunnery.

     abbess. well, daughter, say, what is thy suit with us?

     abigail. fearing the afflictions which my father feels
     proceed from sin or want of faith in us,
     i'd pass away my life in penitence,
     and be a novice in your nunnery,
     to make atonement for my labouring soul.

     friar jacomo. no doubt,

     friar barnardine.
     ay, and of a moving spirit too, brother:  but come,
     let us entreat she may be entertain'd.

     abbess. well, daughter, we admit you for a nun.

     abigail. first let me as a novice learn to frame
     my solitary life to your strait laws,
     and let me lodge where i was wont to lie:
     i do not doubt, by your divine precepts
     and mine own industry, but to profit much.

     barabas. as much, i hope, as all i hid is worth.
          [aside.]

     what wilt thou do among these hateful fiends?
     i charge thee on my blessing that thou leave
     these devils and their damned heresy!

     abigail. father, forgive me-- [50]

     barabas. nay, back, abigail,
     and think upon the jewels and the gold;
     the board is marked thus that covers it.--

     away, accursed, from thy father's sight!

     friar jacomo. barabas, although thou art in misbelief,
     and wilt not see thine own afflictions,
     yet let thy daughter be no longer blind.

     barabas. blind friar, i reck not thy persuasions,--

     mathias. who's this? fair abigail, the rich jew's daughter,
     become a nun! her father's sudden fall
     has humbled her, and brought her down to this:
     tut, she were fitter for a tale of love,
     than to be tired out with orisons;
     and better would she far become a bed,
     embraced in a friendly lover's arms,
     than rise at midnight to a solemn mass.

     vex'd and tormented runs poor barabas
     with fatal curses towards these christians.
     the incertain pleasures of swift-footed time
     have ta'en their flight, and left me in despair;
     and of my former riches rests no more
     but bare remembrance; like a soldier's scar,
     that has no further comfort for his maim.--
     o thou, that with a fiery pillar ledd'st
     the sons of israel through the dismal shades,
     light abraham's offspring; and direct the hand
     of abigail this night! or let the day

     abigail. now have i happily espied a time
     to search the plank my father did appoint;
     and here, behold, unseen, where i have found
     the gold, the pearls, and jewels, which he hid.

     barabas. now i remember those old women's words,
     who in

     for, whilst i live, here lives my soul's sole hope,
     and, when i die, here shall my spirit walk.

     abigail. now that my father's fortune were so good
     as but to be about this happy place!
     'tis not so happy:  yet, when we parted last,
     he said he would attend me in the morn.
     then, gentle sleep, where'er his body rests,
     give charge to morpheus that he may dream
     a golden dream, and of [55] the sudden wake, [56]

     i'll seek him out, and so insinuate,
     that i may have a sight of abigail,
     for don mathias tells me she is fair.

     the dove; that is, more knave than fool.

     i fear me 'tis about fair abigail.

     that ye be both made sure [84] ere you come out.

     barabas. o, heaven forbid i should have such a thought!
     pardon me though i weep:  the governor's son
     will, whether i will or no, have abigail;
     he sends her letters, bracelets, jewels, rings.

     mathias. o treacherous lodowick!

     barabas. even now, as i came home, he slipt me in,
     and i am sure he is with abigail.

     mathias. i'll rouse him thence.

     barabas. not for all malta; therefore sheathe your sword;
     if you love me, no quarrels in my house;
     but steal you in, and seem to see him not:
     i'll give him such a warning ere he goes,

     lodowick. my death! what, is the base-born peasant mad?

     barabas. no, no; but happily [86] he stands in fear
     of that which you, i think, ne'er dream upon,--
     my daughter here, a paltry silly girl.

     lodowick. why, loves she don mathias?

     barabas. doth she not with her smiling answer you?

     abigail. he has my heart; i smile against my will.

     lodowick. barabas, thou know'st i have lov'd thy daughter long.

     that never tasted of the passover,
     nor e'er shall see the land of canaan,

     this gentle maggot, lodowick, i mean,
     must be deluded:  let him have thy hand,

     abigail. what, shall i be betroth'd to lodowick?

     barabas. it's no sin to deceive a christian;
     for they themselves hold it a principle,
     faith is not to be held with heretics:
     but all are heretics that are not jews;
     this follows well, and therefore, daughter, fear not.--
          [aside to her.]
     i have entreated her, and she will grant.

     abigail. o wretched abigail, what hast thou [89] done?
          [aside.]

     lodowick. why on the sudden is your colour chang'd?

     abigail. i know not:  but farewell; i must be gone.

     barabas. stay her, but let her not speak one word more.

     lodowick. mute o' the sudden! here's a sudden change.

     barabas. o, muse not at it; 'tis the hebrews' guise,
     that maidens new-betroth'd should weep a while:
     trouble her not; sweet lodowick, depart:
     she is thy wife, and thou shalt be mine heir.

     barabas. be quiet, lodowick; it is enough
     that i have made thee sure to abigail.

     lodowick. well, let him go.
          [exit.]

     barabas. well, but for me, as you went in at doors
     you had been stabb'd:  but not a word on't now;
     here must no speeches pass, nor swords be drawn.

     mathias. suffer me, barabas, but to follow him.

     barabas. no; so shall i, if any hurt be done,
     be made an accessary of your deeds:
     revenge it on him when you meet him next.

     mathias. for this i'll have his heart.

     barabas. do so.  lo, here i give thee

     mathias. what greater gift can poor mathias have?
     shall lodowick rob me of so fair a love?
     my life is not so dear as abigail.

     barabas. my heart misgives me, that, to cross your love,
     he's with your mother; therefore after him.

     mathias. what, is he gone unto my mother?

     barabas. nay, if you will, stay till she comes herself.

     mathias. i cannot stay; for, if my mother come,
     she'll die with grief.
          [exit.]

     abigail. i cannot take my leave of him for tears.
     father, why have you thus incens'd them both?

     barabas. what's that to thee?

     abigail. i'll make 'em friends again.

     barabas.
     you'll make 'em friends! are there not jews enow in malta,
     but thou must dote upon a christian?

     abigail. i will have don mathias; he is my love.

     barabas. yes, you shall have him.--go, put her in.

     is a courtezan by her attire:  now would i give a hundred of
     the jew's crowns that i had such a concubine.
     well, i have deliver'd the challenge in such sort,

     abigail. why, no.

     ithamore.
     know you not of mathia[s'] and don lodowick['s] disaster?

     abigail. no:  what was it?

     ithamore. why, the devil inverted a challenge, my master
     writ it, and i carried it, first to lodowick, and imprimis
     to mathia[s];
     and then they met, [and], as the story says,
     in doleful wise they ended both their days.

     abigail. and was my father furtherer of their deaths?

     ithamore. am i ithamore?

     abigail. yes.

     ithamore.
     so sure did your father write, and i carry the challenge.

     abigail. well, ithamore, let me request thee this;
     go to the new-made nunnery, and inquire
     for any of the friars of saint jaques, [102]
     and say, i pray them come and speak with me.

     ithamore. i pray, mistress, will you answer me to one question?

     abigail. well, sirrah, what is't?

     ithamore. a very feeling one:  have not the nuns fine sport with
     the friars now and then?

     abigail. hard-hearted father, unkind barabas!
     was this the pursuit of thy policy,
     to make me shew them favour severally,
     that by my favour they should both be slain?
     admit thou lov'dst not lodowick for his sire, [103]
     yet don mathias ne'er offended thee:
     but thou wert set upon extreme revenge,
     because the prior dispossess'd thee once,
     and couldst not venge it but upon his son;
     nor on his son but by mathias' means;
     nor on mathias but by murdering me:

     friar jacomo. virgo, salve.

     ithamore. when duck you?

     abigail. welcome, grave friar.--ithamore, be gone.
          [exit ithamore.]
     know, holy sir, i am bold to solicit thee.

     friar jacomo. wherein?

     abigail. to get me be admitted for a nun.

     friar jacomo. why, abigail, it is not yet long since
     that i did labour thy admission,
     and then thou didst not like that holy life.

     abigail. then were my thoughts so frail and unconfirm'd
     as [104] i was chain'd to follies of the world:
     but now experience, purchased with grief,
     has made me see the difference of things.
     my sinful soul, alas, hath pac'd too long
     the fatal labyrinth of misbelief,
     far from the sun that gives eternal life!

     friar jacomo. who taught thee this?

     abigail. the abbess of the house,
     whose zealous admonition i embrace:
     o, therefore, jacomo, let me be one,
     although unworthy, of that sisterhood!

     friar jacomo. abigail, i will:  but see thou change no more,
     for that will be most heavy to thy soul.

     abigail. that was my father's fault.

     friar jacomo. thy father's! how?

     abigail. nay, you shall pardon me.--o barabas,
     though thou deservest hardly at my hands,
     yet never shall these lips bewray thy life!

     false and unkind! what, hast thou lost thy father?

     art thou again got to the nunnery?

          enter ithamore.

                         o ithamore, come near;
     come near, my love; come near, thy master's life,
     my trusty servant, nay, my second self; [107]
     for i have now no hope but even in thee,
     and on that hope my happiness is built.
     when saw'st thou abigail?

     ithamore. to-day.

     barabas. with whom?

     ithamore. a friar.

     barabas. a friar! false villain, he hath done the deed.

     ithamore. how, sir!

     barabas. why, made mine abigail a nun.

     ithamore. that's no lie; for she sent me for him.

     barabas. o unhappy day!
     false, credulous, inconstant abigail!
     but let 'em go:  and, ithamore, from hence
     ne'er shall she grieve me more with her disgrace;

     the ladle with thee too?

     ithamore. yes, sir; the proverb says, [110] he that eats with the
     devil had need of a long spoon; i have brought you a ladle.

     barabas. very well, ithamore; then now be secret;
     and, for thy sake, whom i so dearly love,
     now shalt thou see the death of abigail,
     that thou mayst freely live to be my heir.

     ithamore. why, master, will you poison her with a mess of rice-
     porridge? that will preserve life, make her round and plump, and
     batten [111] more than you are aware.

     barabas. ay, but, ithamore, seest thou this?
     it is a precious powder that i bought
     of an italian, in ancona, once,
     whose operation is to bind, infect,
     and poison deeply, yet not appear
     in forty hours after it is ta'en.

     friar jacomo. o brother, brother, all the nuns are sick,
     and physic will not help them! they must die.

     friar barnardine. the abbess sent for me to be confess'd:
     o, what a sad confession will there be!

     friar jacomo. and so did fair maria send for me:
     i'll to her lodging; hereabouts she lies.
          [exit.]

          enter abigail.

     friar barnardine. what, all dead, save only abigail!

     abigail. and i shall die too, for i feel death coming.
     where is the friar that convers'd with me? [121]

     friar barnardine. o, he is gone to see the other nuns.

     abigail. i sent for him; but, seeing you are come,
     be you my ghostly father:  and first know,
     that in this house i liv'd religiously,
     chaste, and devout, much sorrowing for my sins;
     but, ere i came--

     friar barnardine. what then?

 
 
 ___________________________
 
    abigail. i did offend high heaven so grievously
     as i am almost desperate for my sins;
     and one offense torments me more than all.
     you knew mathias and don lodowick?

     friar barnardine. yes; what of them?

     abigail. my father did contract me to 'em both;
     first to don lodowick:  him i never lov'd;
     mathias was the man that i held dear,
     and for his sake did i become a nun.

     friar barnardine. so:  say how was their end?

     abigail. both, jealous of my love, envied [122] each other;
     and by my father's practice, [123] which is there
          [gives writing.]
     set down at large, the gallants were both slain.

     friar barnardine. o, monstrous villany!

     abigail. to work my peace, this i confess to thee:
     reveal it not; for then my father dies.

     friar barnardine. know that confession must not be reveal'd;
     the canon-law forbids it, and the priest
     that makes it known, being degraded first,

     and witness that i die a christian!

     friar barnardine. ay, and a virgin too; that grieves me most.
     but i must to the jew, and exclaim on him,
     and make him stand in fear of me.

     barabas. i'll give him something, and so stop his mouth.
          [exit ithamore with friar barnardine.]
     i never heard of any man but he
     malign'd the order of the jacobins:
     but do you think that i believe his words?
     why, brother, you converted abigail;
     and i am bound in charity to requite it,
     and so i will.  o jacomo, fail not, but come.

     friar jacomo. but, barabas, who shall be your godfathers?
     for presently you shall be shriv'd.

     barabas. marry, the turk [134] shall be one of my godfathers,
     but not a word to any of your covent. [135]

     ithamore. guilty, my lord, i confess.  your son and mathias
     were both contracted unto abigail: [he] forged a counterfeit

     i carried it, i confess; but who writ it? marry, even he that
