[CHARACTER] - 
      a young hollywood set and costume designer who has been in california for three months after attending art school at yale. tod looks "doltish" but is quite intelligent and knowledgeable. nonetheless, he seems to prefer socializing with the marginal people of hollywood rather than more successful or mainstream filmmakers. most of the novel focuses on tod's outsider perspective, and it is through the lens of his social and aesthetic value system that we see the grotesque picture of hollywood. though disillusioned by his experience, tod continues to paint and hopes to portray the anger and frustration of the hollywood downtrodden in a large canvas called "the burning of los angeles."
