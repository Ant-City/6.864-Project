hand outstretched, smiling with all his teeth, effusive. 

"controller! what an unexpected pleasure! boys, what are you thinking 
of? this is the controller; this is his fordship, mustapha mond."

clocks simultaneously struck four. discarnate voices called from the

in the lift, on their way up to the changing rooms, henry foster and 
the assistant director of predestination rather pointedly turned their 
backs on bernard marx from the psychology bureau: averted them- 
selves from that unsavoury reputation. 

the faint hum and rattle of machinery still stirred the crimson air in 
the embryo store. shifts might come and go, one lupus-coloured face 
give place to another; majestically and for ever the conveyors crept 
forward with their load of future men and women. 

lenina crowne walked briskly towards the door.

mustapha mond intercepted his anxious glance and the corners of his 
red lips twitched ironically. 

"it's all right, director," he said in a tone of faint derision, "i won't cor- 
rupt them." 

the d.h.c. was overwhelmed with confusion. 

those who feel themselves despised do well to look despising. the 
smile on bernard marx's face was contemptuous. every hair on the 
bear indeed! 



"i shall make a point of going," said henry foster. 

mustapha mond leaned forward, shook a finger at them. "just try to 
realize it," he said, and his voice sent a strange thrill quivering along 
their diaphragms. "try to realize what it was like to have a viviparous 
mother." 

that smutty word again. but none of them dreamed, this time, of smil- 
ing. 

"try to imagine what 'living with one's family' meant." 

they tried; but obviously without the smallest success.

they shook their heads.

"dr. wells says that a three months' pregnancy substitute now will 
make all the difference to my health for the next three or four years." 



"well, i hope he's right," said lenina. "but, fanny, do you really mean 
to say that for the next three months you're not supposed to ..." 

"oh no, dear. only for a week or two, that's all. i shall spend the eve- 
ning at the club playing musical bridge. i suppose you're going out?" 

lenina nodded. 

"who with?" 

"henry foster." 

"again?" fanny's kind, rather moon-like face took on an incongruous 
expression of pained and disapproving astonishment. "do you mean to 
tell me you're still going out with henry foster?" 

mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters. but there were also hus- 
bands, wives, lovers. there were also monogamy and romance.

mond.

peated, as though to an invisible listener behind lenina's left shoulder. 
then, with a sudden change of tone, "but seriously," she said, "i really 
do think you ought to be careful. it's such horribly bad form to go on 
and on like this with one man. at forty, or thirty-five, it wouldn't be so 
bad. but at your age, lenina! no, it really won't do. and you know how 
strongly the d.h.c. objects to anything intense or long-drawn. four 
months of henry foster, without having another man-why, he'd be fu- 
rious if he knew ..." 

"think of water under pressure in a pipe." they thought of it. "i pierce 
it once," said the controller. "what a jet!" 

he pierced it twenty times. there were twenty piddling little fountains.

"mother!" the madness is infectious.

temptations and the lonely remorses, what with all the diseases and 
the endless isolating pain, what with the uncertainties and the pover- 
ty-they were forced to feel strongly. and feeling strongly (and 
strongly, what was more, in solitude, in hopelessly individual isolation), 
how could they be stable? 

"of course there's no need to give him up. have somebody else from 
time to time, that's all. he has other girls, doesn't he?" 

lenina admitted it. 



"of course he does. trust henry foster to be the perfect gentle- 
man-always correct. and then there's the director to think of. you 
know what a stickler ..." 

nodding, "he patted me on the behind this afternoon," said lenina. 

"there, you see!" fanny was triumphant. "that shows what he stands 
for. the strictest conventionality." 

"stability," said the controller, "stability. no civilization without social 
stability. no social stability without individual stability." his voice was a 
trumpet. listening they felt larger, warmer

barriers. 

"fortunate boys!" said the controller. "no pains have been spared to 
make your lives emotionally easy-to preserve you, so far as that is 
possible, from having emotions at all." 

"ford's in his flivver," murmured the d.h.c. "all's well with the world." 

"lenina crowne?" said henry foster, echoing the assistant predestina- 
tor's question as he zipped up his trousers. "oh, she's a splendid girl. 
wonderfully pneumatic. i'm surprised you haven't had her." 

"i can't think how it is i haven't," said the assistant predestinator. "i 
certainly will. at the first opportunity." 

from his place on the opposite side of the changing-room aisle, ber- 
nard marx overheard what they were saying and turned pale. 

"and to tell the truth," said lenina, "i'm beginning to get just a tiny bit

fered to deliver them from those horrible emotions, they wouldn't have 
anything to do with them." 

"talking about her as though she were a bit of meat." bernard ground 
his teeth. "have her here, have her there." like mutton. degrading her 
to so much mutton. she said she'd think it over, she said she'd give 
me an answer this week. oh, ford, ford, ford." he would have liked to 
go up to them and hit them in the face-hard, again and again. 

"yes, i really do advise you to try her," henry foster was saying. 

"take ectogenesis. pfitzner and kawaguchi had got the whole tech- 
nique worked out. but would the governments look at it? no. there 
was something called christianity. women were forced to go on being

"he's so ugly!" said fanny. 

"but i rather like his looks." 

"and then so small." fanny made a grimace; smallness was so horribly 
and typically low-caste.

"what nonsense!" lenina was indignant. 

"sleep teaching was actually prohibited in england. there was some- 
thing called liberalism. parliament, if you know what that was, passed 
a law against it. the records survive. speeches about liberty of the 
subject. liberty to be inefficient and miserable. freedom to be a round 
peg in a square hole." 



"but, my dear chap, you're welcome, i assure you. you're welcome." 
henry foster patted the assistant predestinator on the shoulder. 
"every one belongs to every one else, after all."

bernard marx, who was a specialist on hypnopaedia. sixty-two thou-

bernard had suddenly turned and rushed away. 

benito stared after him. "what can be the matter with the fellow?" he 
wondered, and, shaking his head, decided that the story about the al- 
cohol having been put into the poor chap's blood-surrogate must be 
true. "touched his brain, i suppose." 

he put away the soma bottle, and taking out a packet of sex-hormone 
chewing-gum, stuffed a plug into his cheek and walked slowly away 
towards the hangars, ruminating. 

henry foster had had his machine wheeled out of its lock-up and, 
when lenina arrived, was already seated in the cockpit, waiting. 

"four minutes late," was all his comment, as she climbed in beside 
him. he started the engines and threw the helicopter screws into gear. 
the machine shot vertically into the air. henry accelerated; the hum- 
ming of the propeller shrilled from hornet to wasp, from wasp to mos- 
quito; the speedometer showed that they were rising at the best part 
of two kilometres a minute.

those who meant badly. even lenina 
was making him suffer. he remembered those weeks of timid indeci- 
sion, during which he had looked and longed and despaired of ever 
having the courage to ask her. dared he face the risk of being humili- 
ated by a contemptuous refusal? but if she were to say yes, what rap- 
ture! well, now she had said it and he was still wretched-wretched 
that she should have thought it such a perfect afternoon for obstacle 
golf, that she should have trotted away to join henry foster, that she 
should have found him funny for not wanting to talk of their most pri- 
vate affairs in public. wretched, in a word, because she had behaved 
as any healthy and virtuous english girl ought to behave and not in 
some other, abnormal, extraordinary way. 

he opened the door of his lock-up and called to a lounging couple of 
delta-minus attendants to come and push his machine out on to the 
roof. the hangars were staffed by a single bokanovsky group, and the 
men were twins, identically

, the practical joking of his equals 
among the men. the mockery made him feel an outsider; and feeling 
an outsider he behaved like one, which increased the prejudice against 
him and intensified the contempt and hostility aroused by his physical 
defects. which in turn increased his sense of being alien and alone. a 
chronic fear of being slighted made him avoid his equals, made him 
stand, where his inferiors were concerned, self-consciously on his dig- 
nity. how bitterly he envied men like henry foster and benito hoover! 
men who never had to shout at an epsilon to get an order obeyed; 
men who took their position for granted; men who moved through the 
caste system as a fish through water-so utterly at home as to be un- 
aware either of themselves or of the beneficent and comfortable ele- 
ment in which they had their being. 

slackly, it seemed to him, and with reluctance, the twin attendants 
wheeled his plane out on the roof. 

"hurry up!" said bernard irritably. one of them glanced at hi

were the 
playrooms where, the weather having turned to rain, nine hundred 
older children were amusing themselves with bricks and clay model- 
ling, hunt-the-zipper, and erotic play. 

buzz, buzz! the hive was humming, busily, joyfully. blithe was the 
singing of the young girls over their test-tubes, the predestinators 
whistled as they worked, and in the decanting room what glorious 
jokes were cracked above the empty bottles! but the director's face, 
as he entered the fertilizing room with henry foster, was grave, 
wooden with severity. 

"a public example," he was saying. "in this room, because it contains 
more high-caste workers than any other in the centre. i have told him 
to meet me here at half-past two." 

"he does his work very well," put in henry, with hypocritical generos- 
ity. 

"i know. but that's all the more reason for severity. his intellectual 
eminence carries with it corresponding moral responsibilities. the 
greater a man's talents, the greater his power to lead astray. i

it was john, then, they were all after. and as it was only through ber- 
nard, his accredited guardian, that john could be seen, bernard now 
found himself, for the first time in his life, treated not merely normally, 
but as a person of outstanding importance. there was no more talk of 
the alcohol in his blood-surrogate, no gibes at his personal appear- 
ance. henry foster went out of his way to be friendly; benito hoover 
made him a present of six packets of sex-hormone chewing-gum; the 
assistant predestinator came out and cadged almost abjectly for an in- 
vitation to one of bernard's evening parties. as for the women, ber- 
nard had only to hint at the possibility of an invitation, and he could 
have whichever of them he liked. 

"bernard's asked me to meet the savage next wednesday," fanny an- 
nounced triumphantly.

"it really is a bit too thick," the head mistress of eton was saying to 
the director of crematoria and phosphorus reclamation. "when i think 
that i actually ..." 

"yes," came the voice of fanny crowne, "it's absolutely true about the 
alcohol. some one i know knew some one who was working in the 
embryo store at the time. she said to my friend, and my friend said to 
me ..." 

"too bad, too bad," said henry foster, sympathizing with the arch- 
community-songster. "it may interest you to know that our ex- 
director was on the point of transferring him to iceland." 

pierced by every word that was spoken, the tight balloon of bernard's 
happy self-confidence was leaking from a thousand wounds. pale, dis- 
traught, abject and agitated, he moved among his guests, stammering 
incoherent apologies, assuring them that next time the savage would 
certainly be there, begging them to sit down and take a carotene

"you can't expect me to keep a straight face about fathers and moth- 
ers. and who's going to get excited about a boy having a girl or not 
having her?" (the savage winced; but helmholtz, who was staring 
pensively at the floor, saw nothing.) "no." he concluded, with a sigh, 
"it won't do. we need some other kind of madness and violence. but 
what? what? where can one find it?" he was silent; then, shaking his 
head, "i don't know," he said at last, "i don't know." 



chapter thirteen 

henry foster loomed up through the twilight of the embryo store. 

"like to come to a feely this evening?" 

lenina shook her head without speaking. 

"going out with some one else?" it interested him to know which of his 
friends was being had by which other. "is it benito?" he questioned. 

she shook her head again. 

henry detected the weariness in those purple eyes, the pallor beneath 
that glaze of lupus, the sadness at the corners of the unsmiling crim- 
son mouth. "you're not feeling ill, are you?" h

tomakin, ex-director of hatcheries and conditioning, tomakin was still 
on holiday-on holiday from humiliation and pain, in a world where he 
could not hear those words, that derisive laughter, could not see that 
hideous face, feel those moist and flabby arms round his neck, in a 
beautiful world ... 

"what you need," the savage went on, "is something with tears for a 
change. nothing costs enough here." 

("twelve and a half million dollars," henry foster had protested when 
the savage told him that. "twelve and a half million-that's what the 
new conditioning centre cost. not a cent less.") 
"exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune, death and 
danger dare, even for an eggshell. isn't there something in that?" he 
asked, looking up at mustapha mond. "quite apart from god-though of 
course god would be a reason for it. isn't there something in living 
dangerously?" 

"there's a great deal in it," the controller replied. "men and wo
