.

his companion, mr. shelby, had the appearance of a gentleman; and the
arrangements of the house, and the general air of the housekeeping,
indicated easy, and even opulent circumstances. as we before stated, the
two were in the midst of an earnest conversation.

â€œthat is the way i should arrange the matter,â€ said mr. shelby.

â€œi canâ€™t make trade that way--i positively canâ€™t, mr. shelby,â€ said the
other, holding up a glass of wine between his eye and the light.

â€œwhy, the fact is, haley, tom is an uncommon fellow; he is certainly
worth that sum anywhere,--steady, honest, capable, manages my whole farm
like a clock.â€

â€œyou mean honest, as niggers go,â€ said haley, helping himself to a glass
of brandy.

â€œno; i mean, really, tom is a good, steady, sensible, pious fellow. he
got religion at a camp-meeting, four years ago; and i believe he
really _did_ get it. iâ€™ve trusted him, since then, with everything i
have,--money, house, horses,--and let him come and go round the co

and i always found him true and square in everything.â€

â€œsome folks donâ€™t believe there is pious niggers shelby,â€ said haley,
with a candid flourish of his hand, â€œbut _i do_. i had a fellow, now,
in this yer last lot i took to orleans--â€˜t was as good as a meetin, now,
really, to hear that critter pray; and he was quite gentle and quiet
like. he fetched me a good sum, too, for i bought him cheap of a man
that was â€˜bliged to sell out; so i realized six hundred on him. yes, i
consider religion a valeyable thing in a nigger, when itâ€™s the genuine
article, and no mistake.â€

â€œwell, tomâ€™s got the real article,

â€˜i trust you, because i think youâ€™re a christian--i know you wouldnâ€™t

they say, said to him--tom, why donâ€™t you make tracks for canada?â€™ â€˜ah,
master trusted me, and i couldnâ€™t,â€™--they told me about it. i am sorry
to part with tom, i must say. you ought to let him cover the whole
balance of the debt; and you would, haley, if you had any conscience.â€

â€œwell, iâ€™ve got just as much conscience as any man in business can
afford to keep,--just a little, you know, to swear by, as â€˜t were,â€ said
the trader, jocularly; â€œand, then, iâ€™m ready to do anything in reason
to â€˜blige friends; but this yer, you see, is a leetle too hard on a
fellow--a leetle too hard.â€ the trader sighed contemplatively, and
poured out some more brandy.

â€œwell, then, haley, how will you trade?â€ said mr. shelby, after an

while his master laughed.

â€œcome here, jim crow,â€ said he. the child came up, and the master patted
the curly head, and chucked him under the chin.

â€œnow, jim, show this gentleman how you can dance and sing.â€ the boy
commenced one of those wild, grotesque songs common among the negroes,
in a rich, clear voice, accompanying his singing with many comic
evolutions of the hands, feet, and whole body, all in perfect time to
the music.

â€œbravo!â€ said haley, throwing him a quarter of an orange.

â€œnow, jim, walk like old uncle cudjoe, when he has the rheumatism,â€ said
his master.

instantly the flexible limbs of the child assumed the appearance of
deformity and distortion, as, with his back humped up, and his masterâ€™s
stick in his hand, he hobbled about the room, his childish face drawn
into a doleful pucker, and spitting from right to left, in imitation of
an old man.

both gentlemen laughed uproariously.

â€œnow, jim,â€ said his master, â€

commenced toning a psalm tune through his nose, with imperturbable
gravity.

â€œhurrah! bravo! what a young â€˜un!â€ said haley; â€œthat chapâ€™s a case,
iâ€™ll promise. tell you what,â€ said he, suddenly clapping his hand on mr.
shelbyâ€™s shoulder, â€œfling in that chap, and iâ€™ll settle the business--i
will. come, now, if that ainâ€™t doing the thing up about the rightest!â€

at this moment, the door was pushed gently open, and a young quadroon
woman, apparently about twenty-five, entered the room.

there needed only a glance from the child to her, to identify her as its
mother. there was the same rich, full, dark

â€œi donâ€™t want to make my fortune on her,â€ said mr. shelby, dryly; and,
seeking to turn the conversation, he uncorked a bottle of fresh wine,
and asked his companionâ€™s opinion of it.

â€œcapital, sir,--first chop!â€ said the trader; then turning, and slapping
his hand familiarly on shelbyâ€™s shoulder, he added--

â€œcome, how will you trade about the gal?--what shall i say for
her--whatâ€™ll you take?â€

â€œmr. haley, she is not to be sold,â€ said shelby. â€œmy wife would not part
with her for her weight in gold.â€

â€œay, ay! women always say such things, cause they haâ€™nt no sort of
calculation. just show â€˜em how many watches, feathers, and trinkets,
oneâ€™s weight in gold would buy, and that alters the case, _i_ reckon.â€

â€œi tell you, haley, this must not be spoken of; i say no, and i mean
no,â€ said shelby, decidedly.

now, what if you get the girl off for a day, or a week, or so; then the

get her some ear-rings, or a new gown, or some such truck, to make up
with her.â€

â€œiâ€™m afraid not.â€

â€œlor bless ye, yes! these critters ainâ€™t like white folks, you know;
they gets over things, only manage right. now, they say,â€ said haley,
assuming a candid and confidential air, â€œthat this kind oâ€™ trade is
hardening to the feelings; but i never found it so. fact is, i never
could do things up the way some fellers manage the business. iâ€™ve seen
â€˜em as would pull a womanâ€™s child out of her arms, and set him up
to sell, and she screechinâ€™ like mad all the time;--very bad

experience.â€ and the trader leaned back in his chair, and folded his
arm, with an air of virtuous decision, apparently considering himself a
second wilberforce.

the subject appeared to interest the gentleman deeply; for while mr.
shelby was thoughtfully peeling an orange, haley broke out afresh, with
becoming diffidence, but as if actually driven by the force of truth to
say a few words more.

â€œit donâ€™t look well, now, for a feller to be praisinâ€™ himself; but i say
it jest because itâ€™s the truth. i believe iâ€™m reckoned to bring in about
the finest droves of niggers that is brought in,--at least, iâ€™ve been

and i think i treat niggers just about as well as itâ€™s ever worth while
to treat â€˜em.â€

â€œitâ€™s a happy thing to be satisfied,â€ said mr. shelby, with a slight
shrug, and some perceptible feelings of a disagreeable nature.

â€œwell,â€ said haley, after they had both silently picked their nuts for a
season, â€œwhat do you say?â€

â€œiâ€™ll think the matter over, and talk with my wife,â€ said mr. shelby.
â€œmeantime, haley, if you want the matter carried on in the quiet way
you speak of, youâ€™d best not let your business in this neighborhood be
known. it will get out among my boys, and it will not be a particularly
quiet business getting away any of my fellows, if they know it, iâ€™ll
promise you.â€

impossible to make anything beautiful or desirable in the best regulated
administration of slavery.

mr. shelby was a fair average kind of man, good-natured and kindly, and
disposed to easy indulgence of those around him, and there had never
been a lack of anything which might contribute to the physical comfort
of the negroes on his estate. he had, however, speculated largely and
quite loosely; had involved himself deeply, and his notes to a large
amount had come into the hands of haley; and this small piece of
information is the key to the preceding conversation.

now, it had so happened that, in approaching the door, eliza had caught
enough of the conversation to know that a trader was making offers to
her master for somebody.

she would gladly have stopped at the door to listen, as she came out;
but her mistress just then calling, she was obliged to hasten away.

still she thought she heard the trader make an offer for her boy;--could
she be mistaken? her heart swelled and

r. shelby were seated together in the dining room
afore-named, at a table covered with papers and writing utensils.

mr. shelby was busy in counting some bundles of bills, which, as they
were counted, he pushed over to the trader, who counted them likewise.

â€œall fair,â€ said the trader; â€œand now for signing these yer.â€

mr. shelby hastily drew the bills of sale towards him, and signed them,
like a man that hurries over some disagreeable business, and then pushed
them over with the money. haley produced, from a well-worn valise,
a parchment, which, after looking over it a moment, he handed to mr.
shelby, who took it with a gesture of suppressed eagerness.

â€œwal, now, the thingâ€™s _done_!â€ said the trader, getting up.

â€œitâ€™s _done_!â€ said mr. shelby, in a musing tone; and, fetching a long
breath, he repeated, _â€œitâ€™s done!â€_

â€œyer donâ€™t seem to feel much pleased with it, â€˜pears to me,â€ said the
trader.

us turn round and sell her child?--sell him, perhaps, to certain ruin of
body and soul!â€

â€œiâ€™m sorry you feel so about it,--indeed i am,â€ said mr. shelby; â€œand
i respect your feelings, too, though i donâ€™t pretend to share them to
their full extent; but i tell you now, solemnly, itâ€™s of no use--i canâ€™t
help myself. i didnâ€™t mean to tell you this emily; but, in plain words,
there is no choice between selling these two and selling everything.
either they must go, or _all_ must. haley has come into possession of
a mortgage, which, if i donâ€™t clear off with him directly, will take
everything before it. iâ€™ve raked, and scraped, and borrowed, and all but
begged,--and the price of these two was needed to make up the balance,
and i had to give them up. haley fancied the child; he agreed to settle
the matter that way, and no other. i was in his power, and _had_ to do
it. if you feel so to have them sold, would it be any better to have
_all_ sold?â€

mrs. shelby stood like one

riedly and abstractedly fingering
her gold watch,--â€œi havenâ€™t any jewelry of any amount,â€ she added,
thoughtfully; â€œbut would not this watch do something?--it was an
expensive one, when it was bought. if i could only at least save elizaâ€™s
child, i would sacrifice anything i have.â€

â€œiâ€™m sorry, very sorry, emily,â€ said mr. shelby, â€œiâ€™m sorry this takes
hold of you so; but it will do no good. the fact is, emily, the thingâ€™s
done; the bills of sale are already signed, and in haleyâ€™s hands; and
you must be thankful it is no worse. that man has had it in his power
to ruin us all,--and now he is fairly off. if you knew the man as i do,
youâ€™d think that we had had a narrow escape.â€

â€œis he so hard, then?â€

â€œwhy, not a cruel man, exactly, but a man of leather,--a man alive to
nothing but trade and profit,--cool, and unhesitating, and unrelenting,
as death and the grave. heâ€™d sell his own mother at a good
percentage--not wishing the old woman any harm, either.â€

â€œwell, my dear, the fact is that this goes rather hard with me; itâ€™s

possession tomorrow. iâ€™m going to get out my horse bright and early,
and be off. i canâ€™t see tom, thatâ€™s a fact; and you had better arrange a
drive somewhere, and carry eliza off. let the thing be done when she is
out of sight.â€

â€œno, no,â€ said mrs. shelby; â€œiâ€™ll be in no sense accomplice or help in
this cruel business. iâ€™ll go and see poor old tom, god help him, in his
distress! they shall see, at any rate, that their mistress can feel for

andy soon returned, with eyes very wide in astonishment.

â€œlor, missis! lizyâ€™s drawers is all open, and her things all lying every
which way; and i believe sheâ€™s just done clared out!â€

the truth flashed upon mr. shelby and his wife at the same moment. he
exclaimed,

â€œthen she suspected it, and sheâ€™s off!â€

â€œthe lord be thanked!â€ said mrs. shelby. â€œi trust she is.â€

â€œwife, you talk like a fool! really, it will be something pretty awkward
for me, if she is. haley saw that i hesitated about selling this child,
and heâ€™ll think i connived at it, to get him out of the way. it touches
my honor!â€ and mr. shelby left the room hastily.

there was great running and ejaculating, and opening and shutting of
doors, and appearance of faces in all shades of color in different
places, for about a quarter of an hour. one person only, who might have
shed some light on the matter, was entirely silent, and that was the
head cook, aunt chloe. silently, and with a heavy

closet where missis keeps the great jugs, and i hearn every word.â€ and
mandy, who had never in her life thought of the meaning of a word she
had heard, more than a black cat, now took airs of superior wisdom,
and strutted about, forgetting to state that, though actually coiled up
among the jugs at the time specified, she had been fast asleep all the
time.

when, at last, haley appeared, booted and spurred, he was saluted with
the bad tidings on every hand. the young imps on the verandah were not
disappointed in their hope of hearing him â€œswar,â€ which he did with a
fluency and fervency which delighted them all amazingly, as they
ducked and dodged hither and thither, to be out of the reach of his
riding-whip; and, all whooping off together, they tumbled, in a pile of
immeasurable giggle, on the withered turf under the verandah, where they
kicked up their heels and

shouted to their full satisfaction.

â€œif i had the little devils!â€ muttered haley, between his teeth.

â€œbut you haâ€™nt got â€˜em, though!â€ said andy, with a triumphant flourish,
and making a string of indescribable mouths at the unfortunate traderâ€™s
back, when he was fairly beyond hearing.

â€œi say now, shelby, this yer â€˜s a most extroâ€™rnary business!â€ said
haley, as he abruptly entered the parlor. â€œit seems that gal â€˜s off,
with her young un.â€

â€œmr. haley, mrs. shelby is present,â€ said mr. shelby.

â€œi beg pardon, maâ€™am,â€ said haley, bowing slightly, with a still
lowering brow; â€œbut still i say, as i said before, this yerâ€™s a singâ€™lar
report. is it true, sir?â€

â€œsir,â€ said mr. shelby, â€œif you wish to communicate with me, you must
observe something of the decorum of a gentleman. andy, take mr. haleyâ€™s
hat and riding-whip. take a seat, sir. yes, sir; i regret to say that

â€œi did expect fair dealing in this matter, i confess,â€ said haley.

â€œwell, sir,â€ said mr. shelby, turning sharply round upon him, â€œwhat am
i to understand by that remark? if any man calls my honor in question, i
have but one answer for him.â€

the trader cowered at this, and in a somewhat lower tone said that â€œit
was plaguy hard on a fellow, that had made a fair bargain, to be gulled
that way.â€

â€œmr. haley,â€ said mr. shelby, â€œif i did not think you had some cause
for disappointment, i should not have borne from you the rude and
unceremonious

style of your entrance into my parlor this morning. i say
thus much, however, since appearances call for it, that i shall allow
of no insinuations cast upon me, as if i were at all partner to any
unfairness in this matter. moreover, i shall feel bound to give you
every assistance, in the use of horses, servants, &c., in the recovery
of your property. so, in short, haley,â€ said he, suddenly dropping from
the tone of dignified coolness to his ordinary one of easy frankness,
â€œthe best way for you is to keep good-natured and eat some breakfast,
and we will then see what is to be done.â€

mrs. shelby now rose, and said her engagements would prevent her being
at the breakfast-table that morning; and, deputing a very respectable
mulatto woman to attend to the gentlemenâ€™s coffee at the side-board, she
left the room.

â€œold lady donâ€™t like your humble servant

with an uneasy effort to be very familiar.

â€œi am not accustomed to hear my wife spoken of with such freedom,â€ said
mr. shelby, dryly.

â€œbeg pardon; of course, only a joke, you know,â€ said haley, forcing a
laugh.

â€œsome jokes are less agreeable than others,â€ rejoined shelby.

â€œdevilish free, now iâ€™ve signed those papers, cuss him!â€ muttered haley
to himself; â€œquite grand, since yesterday!â€

never did fall of any prime minister at court occasion wider surges of
sensation than the report of tomâ€™s fate among his compeers on the place.
it was the topic in every mouth, everywhere; and nothing was done in
the house or in the field, but to discuss its probable results. elizaâ€™s
flight--an unprecedented event on the place--was also a great accessory
in stimulating the general excitement.

if he had had a large experience in different sorts of worlds, and
therefore had come to his conclusions advisedly.

â€œnow, sartin iâ€™d a said that missis would a scoured the varsal world

â€œso she would,â€ said andy; â€œbut canâ€™t ye see through a ladder, ye black

and bounced, and pulled hard at his halter.

â€œho, ho!â€ said sam, â€œskeery, ar ye?â€ and his black visage lighted up
with a curious, mischievous gleam. â€œiâ€™ll fix ye now!â€ said he.

there was a large beech-tree overshadowing the place, and the small,
sharp, triangular beech-nuts lay scattered thickly on the ground.
with one of these in his fingers, sam approached the colt, stroked
and patted, and seemed apparently busy in soothing hi

â€œwell, sam, you are to go with mr. haley, to show him the road, and help

mrs. shelby spoke the last words with a low voice, and strong emphasis.

â€œlet dis child alone for dat!â€ said sam, rolling up his eyes with a
volume of meaning. â€œlord knows! high! didnâ€™t say dat!â€ said he, suddenly
catching his breath, with a ludicrous flourish of apprehension, which
made his mistress laugh, spite of herself. â€œyes, missis,

 and sam and andy laid their heads back on their shoulders, and broke
into a low, immoderate laugh, snapping their fingers and flourishing
their heels with exquisite delight.

at this instant, haley appeared on the verandah. somewhat mollified by
certain cups of very good coffee, he came out smiling and talking, in
tolerably restored humor. sam and andy, clawin

to be ready to â€œhelp masâ€™r.â€

samâ€™s palm-leaf had been ingeniously disentangled from all pretensions
to braid, as respects its brim; and the slivers starting apart, and
standing upright, gave it a blazing air of freedom and defiance, quite
equal to that of any fejee chief; while the whole brim of andyâ€™s being
departed bodily, he rapped the crown on his head with a dexterous thump,
and looked about well pleased, as if to say, â€œwho says i havenâ€™t got a
hat?â€

â€œwell, boys,â€ said haley, â€œlook alive now; we must lose no time.â€

â€œnot a bit of him, masâ€™r!â€ said sam, putting haleyâ€™s rein in his hand,
and holding his stirrup, while andy was untying the other two horses.

the instant haley touched the saddle, the mettlesome creature bounded
from the earth with a sudden spring, that threw his master sprawling,
some feet off, on the soft, dry turf. sam, with frantic ejaculations,
made a dive at the reins, but only succeeded in brushing the blazing
palm-leaf afore-named in

 full tilt, shouting, â€œnow for it! cotch
him! cotch him!â€ in a way that would set everything to indiscriminate
rout in a moment.

haley ran up and down, and cursed and swore and stamped miscellaneously.
mr. shelby in vain tried to shout directions from the balcony, and mrs.
shelby from her chamber window alternately laughed and wondered,--not
without some inkling of what lay at the bottom of all this confusion.

at last, about twelve oâ€™clock, sam appeared triumphant, mounted on
jerry, with haleyâ€™s horse by his side, reeking with sweat, but with
flashing eyes and dilated nostrils, showing that the spirit of freedom
had not yet entirely subsided.

â€œheâ€™s cotched!â€ he exclaimed, triumphantly. â€œif â€˜t hadnâ€™t been for me,
they might a bust themselves, all on â€˜em; but i cotched him!â€

â€œyou!â€ growled haley, in no amiable mood. â€œif it hadnâ€™t been for you,
this never would have happened.â€

down, and the critters all in a reek of sweat. why, masâ€™r wonâ€™t think of

mrs. shelby, who, greatly to her amusement, had overheard this
conversation from the verandah, now resolved to do her part. she came
forward, and, courteously expressing her concern for haleyâ€™s accident,
pressed him to stay to dinner, saying that the cook should bring it on
the table immediately.

thus, all things considered, haley, with rather an equivocal grace,
proceeded to the parlor, while sam, rolling his eyes after him
with unutterable meaning, proceeded gravely with the horses to the
stable-yard.

â€œdid yer see him, andy? _did_ yer see him?â€ said sam, when he had got
fairly beyond the shelter of the barn, and fastened the horse to a post.
â€œo, lor, if it warnâ€™t as good as a meetinâ€™, now, to see him a dancinâ€™

s no rest. as a fire in her bones, the thought of the pursuer urged
her on; and she gazed with longing eyes on the sullen, surging waters
that lay between her and liberty.

here we must take our leave of her for the present, to follow the course
of her pursuers.


though mrs. shelby had promised that the dinner should be hurried on
table, yet it was soon seen, as the thing has often been seen before,
that it required more than one to make a bargain. so, although the order
was fairly given out in haleyâ€™s hearing, and carried to aunt chloe by at
least half a dozen juvenile messengers, that dignitary only gave certain
very gruff snorts, and tosses of her head, and went on with every
operation in an unusually leisurely and circumstantial manner.

for some singular reason, an impression seemed to reign among the
servants generally that missis would not be particularly disobliged by
delay; and it was wonderful what a number of counter accidents occurred
constantly, to retard the course of things

due care and formality, aunt chloe watching and stirring with dogged
precision, answering shortly, to all suggestions of haste, that she
â€œwarnâ€™t a going to have raw gravy on the table, to help nobodyâ€™s
catchings.â€ one tumbled down with the water, and had to go to the spring
for more; and another precipitated the butter into the path of events;
and there was from time to time giggling news brought into the kitchen
that â€œmasâ€™r haley was mighty oneasy, and that he couldnâ€™t sit in his
cheer no ways, but was a walkinâ€™ and stalkinâ€™ to the winders and through
the porch.â€

â€œsarves him right!â€ said aunt chloe, indignantly. â€œheâ€™ll get wus nor
oneasy, one of these days, if he donâ€™t mend his ways. _his_ masterâ€™ll be
sending for him, and then see how heâ€™ll look!â€

â€œheâ€™ll go to torment, and no mistake,â€ said little jake.

succeeding in recapturing eliza and her child, and of course the greater
her motive for detaining him by every female artifice. she therefore
graciously smiled, assented, chatted familiarly, and did all she could
to make time pass imperceptibly.

at two oâ€™clock sam and andy brought the horses up to the posts,
apparently greatly refreshed and invigorated by the scamper of the
morning.

sam was there new oiled from dinner, with an abundance of zealous
and ready officiousness. as haley approached, he was boasting, in
flourishing style, to andy, of the evident and eminent success of the
operation, now that he had â€œfarly come to it.â€

â€œyour master, i sâ€™pose, donâ€™t keep no dogs,â€ said haley, thoughtfully,
as he prepared to mount.

â€œheaps on â€˜em,â€ said sam, triumphantly; â€œtharâ€™s bruno--heâ€™s a roarer!
and, besides that, â€˜bout every nigger of us keeps a pup of some natur or
uther.â€

â€œpoh!â€ said haley,--and he said something else, too, with regard to 
 
 ___________________________
 
keep no dogs (i pretty much know he donâ€™t) for
trackinâ€™ out niggers.â€

sam knew exactly what he meant, but he kept on a look of earnest and
desperate simplicity.

â€œour dogs all smells round considable sharp. i spect theyâ€™s the kind,
though they hanâ€™t never had no practice. they â€˜s _far_ dogs, though,
at most anything, if youâ€™d get â€˜em started. here, bruno,â€ he called,
whistling to the lumbering newfoundland, who came pitching tumultuously
toward them.

â€œyou go hang!â€ said haley, getting up. â€œcome, tumble up now.â€

sam tumbled up accordingly, dexterously contriving to tickle andy as
he did so, which occasioned andy to split out into a laugh, greatly to
haleyâ€™s indignation, who made a cut at him with his riding-whip.

â€œi â€˜s â€˜stonished at yer, andy,â€ said sam, with awful gravity. â€œthis
yerâ€™s a seris bisness, andy. yer mustnâ€™t be a makinâ€™ game. this yer anâ€™t
no way to help masâ€™r.â€

â€œi shall take the straight road to the river,â€ said haley,

decidedly,
after they had come to the boundaries of the estate. â€œi know the way of
all of â€˜em,--they makes tracks for the underground.â€

â€œsartin,â€ said sam, â€œdatâ€™s de idee. masâ€™r haley hits de thing right
in de middle. now, derâ€™s two roads to de river,--de dirt road and der
pike,--which masâ€™r mean to take?â€

andy looked up innocently at sam, surprised at hearing this new
geographical fact, but instantly confirmed what he said, by a vehement
reiteration.

â€œcause,â€ said sam, â€œiâ€™d rather be â€˜clined to â€˜magine that lizy â€˜d take
de dirt road, beinâ€™ itâ€™s the least travelled.â€

haley, notwithstanding that he was a very old bird, and naturally
inclined to be

tone in which this was spoken appeared to
amuse andy prodigiously, and he drew a little behind, and shook so as
apparently to run a great risk of failing off his horse, while samâ€™s
face was immovably composed into the most doleful gravity.

â€œcourse,â€ said sam, â€œmasâ€™r can do as heâ€™d ruther, go de straight road,
if masâ€™r thinks best,--itâ€™s all one to us. now, when i study â€˜pon it, i
think de straight road de best, _deridedly_.â€

â€œshe would naturally go a lonesome way,â€ said haley, thinking aloud, and
not minding samâ€™s remark.

â€œdar anâ€™t no sayinâ€™,â€ said sam; â€œgals is pecular; they never does
nothinâ€™ ye thinks they will; mose genâ€™lly the contrary. gals is natâ€™lly
made contrary; and so, if you thinks theyâ€™ve gone one road, it is sartin
youâ€™d better go tâ€™ other, and then youâ€™ll be sure to find â€˜em. now, my
private â€˜pinion is, lizy took der road; so i think weâ€™d better take de
straight one.â€

this profound generic view of the female sex did

ly to the straight road, and he announced decidedly that
he should go the other, and asked sam when they should come to it.

â€œa little piece ahead,â€ said sam, giving a wink to andy with the eye
which was on andyâ€™s side of the head; and he added, gravely, â€œbut iâ€™ve
studded on de matter, and iâ€™m quite clar we ought not to go dat ar way.
i nebber been over it no way. itâ€™s despit lonesome, and we might lose
our way,--whar weâ€™d come to, de lord only knows.â€

â€œnevertheless,â€ said haley, â€œi shall go that way.â€

â€œnow i think on â€˜t, i think i hearn â€˜em tell that dat ar road was all
fenced up and down by der creek, and thar, anâ€™t it, andy?â€

andy wasnâ€™t certain; heâ€™d only â€œhearn tellâ€ about that road, but never
been over it. in short, he was strictly noncommittal.

haley, accustomed to strike the balance of probabilities between lies
of greater or lesser magnitude, thought that it lay in favor of the dirt
road aforesaid. the mention of the thing he thought h

e perceived
was involuntary on samâ€™s part at first, and his confused attempts to
dissuade him he set down to a desperate lying on second thoughts, as
being unwilling to implicate liza.

when, therefore, sam indicated the road, haley plunged briskly into it,
followed by sam and andy.

now, the road, in fact, was an old one, that had formerly been a
thoroughfare to the river, but abandoned for many years after the laying
of the new pike. it was open for about an hourâ€™s ride, and after that it
was cut across by various farms and fences. sam knew this fact perfectly
well,--indeed, the road had been so long closed up, that andy had never
heard of it. he therefore rode along with an air of dutiful submission,
only groaning and

 vociferating occasionally that â€˜t was â€œdespâ€™t rough,
and bad for jerryâ€™s foot.â€

â€œnow, i jest give yer warning,â€ said haley, â€œi know yer; yer wonâ€™t get
me to turn off this road, with all yer fussinâ€™--so you shet up!â€

â€œmasâ€™r will go his own way!â€ said sam, with rueful submission, at the
same time winking most portentously to andy, whose delight was now very
near the explosive point.

sam was in wonderful spirits,--professed to keep a very brisk
lookout,--at one time exclaiming that he saw â€œa galâ€™s bonnetâ€ on the top
of some distant eminence, or calling to andy â€œif that thar wasnâ€™t â€˜lizyâ€™

down in the hollow;â€ always making these exclamations in some rough
or craggy part of the road, where the sudden quickening of speed was a
special inconvenience to all parties concerned, and thus keeping haley
in a state of constant commotion.

after riding about an hour in this way, the whole party made a
precipitate and tumultuous descent into a barn-yard belonging to a large
farming establishment. not a soul was in sight, all the hands being
employed in the fields; but, as the barn stood conspicuously and plainly
square across the road, it was evident that their journey in that
direction had reached a decided finale.

â€œwanâ€™t dat ar what i telled masâ€™r?â€ said sam, with an air of injured
inn

ocence. â€œhow does strange gentleman spect to know more about a
country dan de natives born and raised?â€

â€œyou rascal!â€ said haley, â€œyou knew all about this.â€

â€œdidnâ€™t i tell yer i _knowd_, and yer wouldnâ€™t believe me? i telled
masâ€™r â€˜t was all shet up, and fenced up, and i didnâ€™t spect we could get
through,--andy heard me.â€

it was all too true to be disputed, and the unlucky man had to pocket
his wrath with the best grace he was able, and all three faced to the
right about, and took up their line of march for the highway.

in consequence of all the various delays, it was about three-quarters
of an hour

after eliza had laid her child to sleep in the village tavern
that the party came riding into the same place. eliza was standing
by the window, looking out in another direction, when samâ€™s quick eye
caught a glimpse of her. haley and andy were two yards behind. at this
crisis, sam contrived to have his hat blown off, and uttered a loud
and characteristic ejaculation, which startled her at once; she drew
suddenly back; the whole train swept by the window, round to the front
door.

a thousand lives seemed to be concentrated in that one moment to eliza.
her room opened by a side door to the river. she caught her child, and
sprang down the steps towards it. the trader caught a full glimpse of
her just as she was disappearin

s horse, and calling loudly on sam and andy, he was after her
like a hound after a deer. in that dizzy moment her feet to her scarce
seemed to touch the ground, and a moment brought her to the waterâ€™s
edge. right on behind they came; and, nerved with strength such as god
gives only to the desperate, with one wild cry and flying leap, she
vaulted sheer over the turbid current by the shore, on to the raft of
ice beyond. it was a desperate leap--impossible to anything but madness
and despair; and haley, sam, and andy, instinctively cried out, and
lifted up their hands, as she did it.

the huge green fragment of ice on which she alighted pitched and creaked
as her weight came on it, but she staid there not a moment. with wild
cries and desperate energy she leaped to another and still another cake;
stumbling--leaping--slipping--springing upwards again! her shoes are
gone--her stockings cut from her feet--while blood marked every step;
but she saw nothing, felt nothing, till dimly, as in a dream

in his constitutional relations, and consequently was betrayed into
acting in a sort of christianized manner, which, if he had been better
situated and more enlightened, he would not have been left to do.

haley had stood a perfectly amazed spectator of the scene, till eliza
had disappeared up the bank, when he turned a blank, inquiring look on
sam and andy.

â€œthat ar was a tolable fair stroke of business,â€ said sam.

â€œthe gal â€˜s got seven devils in her, i believe!â€ said haley. â€œhow like a
wildcat she jumped!â€

â€œwal, now,â€ said sam, scratching his head, â€œi hope masâ€™râ€™ll â€˜scuse us
trying dat ar road. donâ€™t think i feel spry enough for dat ar, no way!â€
 and sam gave a hoarse chuckle.

â€œ_you_ laugh!â€ said the trader, with a growl.

â€œlord bless you, masâ€™r, i couldnâ€™t help it now,â€ said sam, giving way to
the long pent-up delight of his soul. â€œshe looked so curiâ€™s, a leapinâ€™
and springinâ€™--ice a crackinâ€™--and only to hear her,--pl

ump! ker chunk!

till the tears rolled down their cheeks.

â€œiâ€™ll make ye laugh tâ€™ other side yer mouths!â€ said the trader, laying
about their heads with his riding-whip.

both ducked, and ran shouting up the bank, and were on their horses
before he was up.

â€œgood-evening, masâ€™r!â€ said sam, with much gravity. â€œi berry much spect
missis be anxious â€˜bout jerry. masâ€™r haley wonâ€™t want us no longer.
missis wouldnâ€™t hear of our ridinâ€™ the critters over lizyâ€™s bridge
tonight;â€ and, with a facetious poke into andyâ€™s ribs, he started off,
followed by the latter, at full speed,--their shouts of laughter coming
faintly on the wind.



chapter viii

elizaâ€™s escape


eliza made her desperate retreat across the river just in the dusk
of twilight. the gray mist of evening, rising slowly from the river,
enveloped her as she disappeared up the bank, and the swoll

and floundering masses of ice presented a hopeless barrier between her
and her pursuer. haley therefore slowly and discontentedly returned
to the little tavern, to ponder further what was to be done. the woman
opened to him the door of a little parlor, covered with a rag carpet,
where stood a table with a very shining black oil-cloth, sundry lank,
high-backed wood chairs, with some plaster images in resplendent colors
on the mantel-shelf, above a very dimly-smoking grate; a long hard-wood
settle extended its uneasy length by the chimney, and here haley sat
him down to meditate on the in

haley relieved himself by repeating over a not very select litany of
imprecations on himself, which, though there was the best possible
reason to consider them as true, we shall, as a matter of taste, omit.

he was startled by the loud and dissonant voice of a man who was
apparently dismounting at the door. he hurried to the window.

â€œby the land! if this yer anâ€™t the nearest, now, to what iâ€™ve heard
folks call providence,â€ said haley. â€œi do bâ€™lieve that arâ€™s tom loker.â€

haley hastened out. standing by the bar, in the corner of the room,
was a brawny, muscular man, full six feet in height, and broad in
proportion. he was dressed in a coat of buffalo-skin, made with the hair
outward, which gave him a shaggy and fierce appearance, perfectly in
keeping with the whole air of his physiognomy. in the head and face
every organ and lineament expressive of brutal and unhesitating violence
was in a state of the highest possib

e other, and snuffing considerately in the directions of the various
bottles, ordered at last a mint julep, in a thin and quivering voice,
and with an air of great circumspection. when poured out, he took it and
looked at it with a sharp, complacent air, like a man who thinks he has
done about the right thing, and hit the nail on the head, and proceeded
to dispose of it in short and well-advised sips.

â€œwal, now, whoâ€™d a thought this yer luck â€˜ad come to me? why, loker, how
are ye?â€ said haley, coming forward, and extending his hand to the big
man.

â€œthe devil!â€ was the civil reply. â€œwhat brought you here, haley?â€

the mousing man, who bore the name of marks, instantly stopped his
sipping, and, poking his head forward, looked shrewdly on the new
acquaintance, as a cat sometimes looks at a moving dry leaf, or some
other possible object of pursuit.

â€œi say, tom, this yerâ€™s the luckiest thing in the world. iâ€™m in a devil
of a hobble, and you must help me out.â€

â€œugh? a

w! like enough!â€ grunted his complacent acquaintance. â€œa body may
be pretty sure of that, when _youâ€™re_ glad to see â€˜em; something to be
made off of â€˜em. whatâ€™s the blow now?â€

â€œyouâ€™ve got a friend here?â€ said haley, looking doubtfully at marks;
â€œpartner, perhaps?â€

â€œyes, i have. here, marks! hereâ€™s that ar feller that i was in with in
natchez.â€

â€œshall be pleased with his acquaintance,â€ said marks, thrusting out a
long, thin hand, like a ravenâ€™s claw. â€œmr. haley, i believe?â€

â€œthe same, sir,â€ said haley. â€œand now, gentlemen, seeinâ€™ as weâ€™ve met so
happily, i think iâ€™ll stand up to a small matter of a treat in this here
parlor. so, now, old coon,â€ said he to the man at the bar, â€œget us hot
water, and sugar, and cigars, and plenty of the _real stuff_ and weâ€™ll
have a blow-out.â€

behold, then, the candles lighted, the fire stimulated to the burning
point in the grate, and our three worthies seated round a table, well
spread with all

the accessories to good fellowship enumerated before.

haley began a pathetic recital of his peculiar troubles. loker shut up
his mouth, and listened to him with gruff and surly attention. marks,
who was anxiously and with much fidgeting compounding a tumbler of punch
to his own peculiar taste, occasionally looked up from his employment,
and, poking his sharp nose and chin almost into haleyâ€™s face, gave the
most earnest heed to the whole narrative. the conclusion of it appeared
to amuse him extremely, for he shook his shoulders and sides in silence,
and perked up his thin lips with an air of great internal enjoyment.

â€œso, then, yeâ€™r fairly sewed up, anâ€™t ye?â€ he said; â€œhe! he! he! itâ€™s
neatly done, too.â€

â€œthis yer young-un business makes lots of trouble in the trade,â€ said
haley, dolefully.

â€œif we could get a breed of gals that didnâ€™t care, now, for thei

modâ€™rn improvement i knows on,â€--and marks patronized his joke by a
quiet introductory sniggle.

â€œjes so,â€ said haley; â€œi never couldnâ€™t see into it; young uns is heaps
of trouble to â€˜em; one would think, now, theyâ€™d be glad to get clar on
â€˜em; but they arnâ€™t. and the more trouble a young un is, and the more
good for nothing, as a genâ€™l thing, the tighter they sticks to â€˜em.â€

â€œwal, mr. haley,â€ said marks, â€œâ€˜est pass the hot water. yes, sir, you
say â€˜est what i feel and allâ€™us have. now, i bought a gal once, when
i was in the trade,--a tight, likely wench she was, too, and quite
considerable smart,--and she had a young un that was misâ€™able sickly; it
had a crooked back, or something or other; and i jest gin â€˜t away to

it, she did, and lopped round, as if sheâ€™d lost every friend she had.
it reâ€™lly was droll to think on â€˜t. lord, there ainâ€™t no end to womenâ€™s
notions.â€

â€œwal, jest so with me,â€ said haley. â€œlast summer, down on red river, i

brought down his fist with a thump that fully explained the hiatus.

â€œthat arâ€™s what ye may call _emphasis_,â€ said marks, poking haley in the
side, and going into another small giggle. â€œanâ€™t tom peculiar? he! he! i

woolly. they donâ€™t never have no doubt oâ€™ your meaning, tom. if you anâ€™t

tom received the compliment with becoming modesty, and began to look
as affable as was consistent, as john bunyan says, â€œwith his doggish
nature.â€

â€œboh!â€ said tom, â€œ_donâ€™t_ i know?--donâ€™t make me too sick with any yer
stuff,--my stomach is a leetle riled now;â€ and tom drank half a glass of
raw brandy.

â€œi say,â€ said haley, and leaning back in his chair and gesturing
impressively, â€œiâ€™ll say this now, i alâ€™ays meant to drive my trade so as
to make money on â€˜t _fust and foremost_, as much as any man; but, then,
trade anâ€™t everything, and money anâ€™t everything, â€˜cause we â€˜s all got

to find a soul in you,--save yourself any care on that score. if the

â€œwhy, tom, youâ€™re cross,â€ said haley; â€œwhy canâ€™t ye take it pleasant,

â€œstop that ar jaw oâ€™ yourn, there,â€ said tom, gruffly. â€œi can stand most

tom, whose great heavy mouth had stood ajar during this communication,
now suddenly snapped it together, as a big dog closes on a piece of
meat, and seemed to be digesting the idea at his leisure.

â€œye see,â€ said marks to haley, stirring his punch as he did so, â€œye see,

ho, as we have made it appear, was a man of slow thoughts

the table, so as to make all ring again, _â€œitâ€™ll do!â€_ he said.

â€œlord bless ye, tom, ye neednâ€™t break all the glasses!â€ said marks;
â€œsave your fist for time oâ€™ need.â€

â€œbut, gentlemen, anâ€™t i to come in for a share of the profits?â€ said
haley.

â€œanâ€™t it enough we catch the boy for ye?â€ said loker. â€œwhat do ye want?â€

â€œwal,â€ said haley, â€œif i gives you the job, itâ€™s worth something,--say
ten per cent. on the profits, expenses paid.â€

his heavy fist, â€œdonâ€™t i know _you_, dan haley? donâ€™t you think to come

quite welcome.â€

â€œo, wal, certainly, jest let it go at that,â€ said haley, alarmed; â€œyou

was up to yer word.â€

â€œye know that,â€ said tom; â€œi donâ€™t pretend none of your snivelling ways,

â€œwhy, when you have a job in hand that may bring a clean profit

â€œyes, and hasnâ€™t we business booked for five weeks to come,--all we can

â€œwe must cross the river tonight, no mistake,â€ said tom.

passed. with all these evolutions, he contrived to keep the horses up
to the top of their speed, until, between ten and eleven, their heels
resounded on the gravel at the end of the balcony. mrs. shelby flew to
the railings.

â€œthey are a kind of providences that youâ€™ll have to be pretty sparing

circumstances.

now, there is no more use in making believe be angry with a negro than

by this rebuke, though he assumed an air of doleful gravity, and stood
with the corners of his mouth lowered in most penitential style.

â€œmasâ€™r quite right,--quite; it was ugly on me,--thereâ€™s no disputinâ€™

alacrity, and departing.

i tell you solemnly, and before god, that i will keep trace of you,

here the boys called out that masâ€™r haley was coming, and then an
unceremonious kick pushed open the door. haley stood there in very
ill humor, having ridden hard the night before, and being not at all
pacified by his ill success in recapturing his prey.

â€œcome,â€ said he, â€œye nigger, yeâ€™r ready? servant, maâ€™am!â€ said he,
taking off his hat, as he saw mrs. shelby.

aunt chloe shut and corded the box, and, getting up, looked gruffly on
the trader, her tears seeming suddenly turned to sparks of fire.

tom rose up meekly, to fo

particularly among the women.

â€œwhy, chloe, you bar it better â€˜n we do!â€ said one of the women, who had
been weeping freely, noticing the gloomy calmness with which aunt chloe
stood by the wagon.

â€œiâ€™s done _my_ tears!â€ she said, looking grimly at the trader, who was
coming up. â€œi does not feel to cry â€˜fore dat ar old limb, no how!â€

â€œget in!â€ said haley to tom, as he strode through the crowd of servants,
who looked at him with lowering brows.

tom got in, and haley, drawing out from under the wagon seat a heavy
pair of shackles, made them fast around each ankle.

a smothered groan of indignation ran through the whole circle, and
mrs. shelby spoke from the verandah,--â€œmr. haley, i assure you that
precaution is entirely unnecessary.â€

ons awoke his
half-slumbering regrets; and tomâ€™s manly disinterestedness increased the
unpleasantness of his feelings. it was in vain that he said to himself
that he had a _right_ to do it,--that everybody did it,--and that some
did it without even the excuse of necessity;--he could not satisfy his
own feelings; and that he might not witness the unpleasant scenes of
the consummation, he had gone on a short business tour up the country,
hoping that all would be over before he returned.

tom and haley rattled on along the dusty road, whirling past every old
familiar spot, until the bounds of the estate were fairly passed, and
they found themselves out on the open pike. after they had ridden about
a mile, haley suddenly drew up at the door of a blacksmithâ€™s shop, when,
taking out with him a pair of handcuffs, he stepped into the shop, to
have a little alteration in them.

â€œthese yer â€˜s a little too small for his build,â€ said haley, showing the
fetters, and pointing out to tom.

ye neednâ€™t go to fetterinâ€™ him up this yer way. heâ€™s the faithfullest,

â€œyes, yes,â€ said haley; â€œbut your good fellers are just the critturs to

and like as not be rather pleased to be toted round; but these yer

â€œwal, now, a feller canâ€™t help thinkinâ€™ itâ€™s a mighty pity to have a

â€œwal, heâ€™s got a faâ€™r chance. i promised to do well by him. iâ€™ll get

tom was sitting very mournfully on the outside of the shop while this
conversation was going on. suddenly he heard the quick, short click of
a horseâ€™s hoof behind him; and, before he could fairly awake from his
surprise, young master george sprang into the wagon, threw his arms
tumultuously round his neck, and was sobbing and scolding with energy.

â€œi declare, itâ€™s real mean! i donâ€™t care what they say, any of â€˜em! itâ€™s

â€œlook here, now, mister,â€ said george, with an air of great superiority,
as he got out, â€œi shall let father and mother know how you treat uncle
tom!â€

â€œyouâ€™re welcome,â€ said the trader.

â€œi should think youâ€™d be ashamed to spend all your life buying men and
women, and chaining them, like cattle! i should think youâ€™d feel mean!â€
 said george.

â€œso long as your grand folks wants to buy men and women, iâ€™m as good
as they is,â€ said haley; â€œâ€˜tanâ€™t any meaner sellinâ€™ on â€˜em, that â€˜t is

â€œiâ€™ll never do either, when iâ€™m a man,â€ said george; â€œiâ€™m ashamed, this
day, that iâ€™m a kentuckian. i always was proud of it before;â€ and george
sat very straight on his horse, and looked round with an air, as if he
expected the state would be impressed with his opinion.

â€œwell, good-by, uncle tom; keep a stiff upper lip,â€ said george.

â€œgood-by, masâ€™r george,â€ said tom, looking fondly and admirin

gly at him.
â€œgod almighty bless you! ah! kentucky hanâ€™t got many like you!â€ he said,
in the fulness of his heart, as the frank, boyish face was lost to his
view. away he went, and tom looked, till the clatter of his horseâ€™s
heels died away, the last sound or sight of his home. but over his heart
there seemed to be a warm spot, where those young hands had placed that
precious dollar. tom put up his hand, and held it close to his heart.

â€œnow, i tell ye what, tom,â€ said haley, as he came up to the wagon, and
threw in the handcuffs, â€œi mean to start faâ€™r with ye, as i genâ€™ally do

tom assured haley that he had no present intentions of running off. in
fact, the exhortation seemed rather a superfluous one to a man with a
great pair of iron fetters on his feet. but mr. haley had got in
the habit of commencing his relations with his stock with little
exhortations of this nature, calculated, as he deemed, to inspire
cheerfulness and confidence, and prevent the necessity of any unpleasant
scenes.

and here, for the present, we take our leave of tom, to pursue the
fortunes of other characters in our story.

select incident of lawful trade


â€œin ramah there was a voice heard,--weeping, and lamentation, and great
mourning; rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted.â€ *

mr. haley and tom jogged onward in their wagon, each, for a time,
absorbed in his own reflections. now, the reflections of two men sitting
side by side are a curious thing,--seated on the same seat, having the
same eyes, ears, hands and organs of all sorts, and having pass before
their eyes the same objects,--it is wonderful what a variety we shall
find in these same reflections!

as, for example, mr. haley: he thought first of tomâ€™s length, and
breadth, and height, and what he would sell for, if he wa

tinuing city, but we seek one to come; wherefore god
himself is not ashamed to be called our god; for he hath prepared for
us a city.â€ these words of an ancient volume, got up principally by
â€œignorant and unlearned men,â€ have, through all time, kept up, somehow,
a strange sort of power over the minds of poor, simple fellows, like
tom. they stir up the soul from its depths, and rouse, as with trumpet
call, courage, energy, and enthusiasm, where before was only the
blackness of despair.

mr. haley pulled out of his pocket sundry newspapers, and began
looking over their advertisements, with absorbed interest. he was not a
remarkably fluent reader, and was in the habit of reading in a sort
of recitative half-aloud, by way of calling in his ears to verify the
deductions of his eyes. in this tone he slowly recited the following
paragraph:

thrown into jail by no means produced an agreeable impression on a poor
fellow who had always prided himself on a strictly honest and upright
course of life. yes, tom, we must confess it, was rather proud of his
honesty, poor fellow,--not having very much else to be proud of;--if he
had belonged to some of the higher walks of society, he, perhaps, would
never have been reduced to such straits. however, the day wore on,
and the evening saw haley and tom comfortably accommodated in
washington,--the one in a tavern, and the other in a jail.

about eleven oâ€™clock the next day, a mixed throng was gathered around
the court-house steps,--smoking, chewing, spitting, swearing, and
conversing, according to their respective tastes and turns,--waiting
for the auction to commence. the men and women to be sold sat in a
group apart, talking in a low tone to each other. the woman who had been
advertised by the name of hagar was a regular african in

to show his muscles; and then passed on to the next, and put him
through the same trial. walking up last to the boy, he felt of his arms,
straightened his hands, and looked at his fingers, and made him jump, to
show his agility.

â€œhe anâ€™t gwine to be sold widout me!â€ said the old woman, with
passionate eagerness; â€œhe and i goes in a lot together; i â€˜s rail strong

 and, as if satisfied with his examination, he walked out and looked, and
stood with his hands in his pocket, his cigar in his mouth, and his hat
cocked on one side, ready for action.

â€œwhat think of â€˜em?â€ said a man who had been following haleyâ€™s
examination, as if to make up his own mind from it.

â€œsome buys up these yer old critturs, and ses thereâ€™s a sight more wear

â€œno go, â€˜t all,â€ said haley; â€œwouldnâ€™t take her for a
present,--fact,--iâ€™ve _seen_, now.â€

â€œwal, â€˜t is kinder pity, now, not to buy her with her son,--her heart
seems so sot on him,--sâ€™pose they fling her in cheap.â€

â€œthem thatâ€™s got money to spend that ar way, itâ€™s all well enough.
i shall bid off on that ar boy for a plantation-hand;--wouldnâ€™t be
bothered with her, no way, not if theyâ€™d give her to me,â€ said haley.

â€œsheâ€™ll take on despâ€™t,â€ said the man.

â€œo, mammy, iâ€™m feard they wonâ€™t,â€ said the boy.

â€œdey must, child; i canâ€™t live, no ways, if they donâ€™tâ€ said the old
creature, vehemently.

the stentorian tones of the auctioneer, calling out to clear the way,
now announced that the sale was about to commence. a place was cleared,
and the bidding began. the different men on the list were soon knocked
off at prices which showed a pretty brisk demand in the market; two of
them fell to haley.

â€œcome, now, young un,â€ said the auctioneer, giving the boy a touch with
his hammer, â€œbe up and show your springs, now.â€

â€œput us two up togedder, togedder,--do please, masâ€™r,â€ said the old
woman, holding fast to her boy.

â€œbe off,â€ said the man, gruffly, pushing her hands away; â€œyou come last.
now, darkey, spring;â€ and, with the word, he pushed the boy toward the
block, while a deep, heavy groan rose behind him. the boy paused, and
looked back; but there was no time to s

tay, and, dashing the tears from
his large, bright eyes, he was up in a moment.

his fine figure, alert limbs, and bright face, raised an instant
competition, and half a dozen bids simultaneously met the ear of the
auctioneer. anxious, half-frightened, he looked from side to side, as
he heard the clatter of contending bids,--now here, now there,--till the
hammer fell. haley had got him. he was pushed from the block toward his
new master, but stopped one moment, and looked back, when his poor old
mother, trembling in every limb, held out her shaking hands toward him.

â€œbuy me too, masâ€™r, for de dear lordâ€™s sake!--buy me,--i shall die if
you donâ€™t!â€

â€œyouâ€™ll die if i do, thatâ€™s the kink of it,â€ said haley,--â€œno!â€ and he
turned on his heel.

the bidding for the poor old creature was summary. the man who had
addressed haley, and who seemed not de

sorrowfully.

â€œwhat good will it do?â€ said she, sobbing passionately.

â€œmother, mother,--donâ€™t! donâ€™t!â€ said the boy. â€œthey say you â€˜s got a
good master.â€

â€œi donâ€™t care,--i donâ€™t care. o, albert! oh, my boy! you â€˜s my last
baby. lord, how ken i?â€

â€œcome, take her off, canâ€™t some of ye?â€ said haley, dryly; â€œdonâ€™t do no
good for her to go on that ar way.â€

the old men of the company, partly by persuasion and partly by force,
loosed the poor creatureâ€™s last despairing hold, and, as they led her
off to her new masterâ€™s wagon, strove to comfort her.

â€œnow!â€ said haley, pushing his three purchases together, and producing
a bundle of handcuffs, which he proceeded to put on their wrists; and
fastening each handcuff to a long chain, he drove them before him to the
jail.

the boat moved on, by various other merchandise of the same kind, which
he, or his agent, had stored for him in various points along shore.

the la belle riviere, as brave and beautiful a boat as ever walked the
waters of her namesake river, was floating gayly down the stream,
under a brilliant sky, the stripes and stars of free america waving and

guards crowded with well-dressed ladies and

buoyant and rejoicing;--all but haleyâ€™s gang, who were stored, with
other freight, on the lower deck, and who, somehow, did not seem to
appreciate their various privileges, as they sat in a knot, talking to
each other in low tones.

â€œboys,â€ said haley, coming up, briskly, â€œi hope you keep up good heart,
and are cheerful. now, no sulks, ye see; keep stiff upper lip, boys; do
well by me, and iâ€™ll do well by you.â€

the boys addressed responded the invariable â€œyes, masâ€™r,â€ for ages
the watchword of poor africa; but itâ€™s to be owned they did not look
particularly cheerful; they had their various little prejudices in favor
of wives, mothers, sisters, and children, seen for the last time,--and

haley, who had been standing, with his hands in his pockets, by the
stove and intently listening to the conversation.

â€œyes,â€ continued the tall man, â€œwe must all be resigned to the decrees
of providence. niggers must be sold, and trucked round, and kept
under; itâ€™s what theyâ€™s made for. â€˜pears like this yer view â€˜s quite
refreshing, anâ€™t it, stranger?â€ said he to haley.

â€œi never thought on â€˜t,â€ said haley, â€œi couldnâ€™t have said as much,
myself; i haâ€™nt no larning. i took up the trade just to make a living;
if â€˜tanâ€™t right, i calculated to â€˜pent on â€˜t in time, ye know.â€

â€œand now youâ€™ll save yerself the trouble, wonâ€™t ye?â€ said the tall man.

but what needs tell the story, told too oft,--every day told,--of
heart-strings rent and broken,--the weak broken and torn for the profit
and convenience of the strong! it needs not to be told;--every day is
telling it,--telling it, too, in the ear of one who is not deaf, though
he be long silent.

the young man who had spoken for the cause of humanity and god before
stood with folded arms, looking on this scene. he turned, and haley
was standing at his side. â€œmy friend,â€ he said, speaking with thick
utterance, â€œhow can you, how dare you, carry on a trade like this? look
at those poor creatures! here i am, rejoicing in my heart that i am
going home to my wife and child; and the same bell which is a signal
to carry me onward towards them will part this poor man and his wife
forever. depend upon it, god will bring you into judgment for this.â€

the trader turned away in silence.

days, as all on us must, i reckon.â€

haley walked reflectively to the other end of the boat.

â€œif i make pretty handsomely on one or two next gangs,â€ he thought, â€œi
reckon iâ€™ll stop off this yer; itâ€™s really getting dangerous.â€ and he
took out his pocket-book, and began adding over his accounts,--a process
which many gentlemen besides mr. haley have found a specific for an
uneasy conscience.

the boat swept proudly away from the shore, and all went on merrily, as
before. men talked, and loafed, and read, and smoked. women sewed, and
children played, and the boat passed on her way.

one day, when she lay to for a while at a small town in kentucky, haley
went up into the place on a little matter of business.

tom, whose fetters did not prevent his taking a moderate circuit, had
drawn near the side of the boat, and stood listlessly gazin

hich he eagerly grabbed at, and very soon had it in a babyâ€™s general
depository, to wit, his mouth.

â€œrum fellow!â€ said the man â€œknows whatâ€™s what!â€ and he whistled, and
walked on. when he had got to the other side of the boat, he came across
haley, who was smoking on top of a pile of boxes.

the stranger produced a match, and lighted a cigar, saying, as he did
so,

â€œdecentish kind oâ€™ wench youâ€™ve got round there, stranger.â€

â€œwhy, i reckon she _is_ tolâ€™able fair,â€ said haley, blowing the smoke
out of his mouth.

â€œtaking her down south?â€ said the man.

haley nodded, and smoked on.

â€œplantation hand?â€ said the man.

â€œwal,â€ said haley, â€œiâ€™m fillinâ€™ out an order for a plantation, and i
think i shall put her in. they telled me she was a good cook; and they
can use her for that, or set her at the cotton-picking. sheâ€™s got the
right fingers for that; i looked at â€˜em. sell well, either way;â€ and
haley resumed his cigar.

â€œthey wonâ€™t want the you

â€œi shall sell him, first chance i find,â€ said haley, lighting another
cigar.

â€œsâ€™pose youâ€™d be selling him tolâ€™able cheap,â€ said the stranger,
mounting the pile of boxes, and sitting down comfortably.

â€œdonâ€™t know â€˜bout that,â€ said haley; â€œheâ€™s a pretty smart young â€˜un,
straight, fat, strong; flesh as hard as a brick!â€

â€œvery true, but then thereâ€™s the bother and expense of raisinâ€™.â€

â€œnonsense!â€ said haley; â€œthey is raised as easy as any kind of critter
there is going; they anâ€™t a bit more trouble than pups. this yer chap
will be running all around, in a month.â€

â€œiâ€™ve got a good place for raisinâ€™, and i thought of takinâ€™ in a little
more stock,â€ said the man. â€œone cook lost a young â€˜un last week,--got

willing to broach the test question of the interview. at last the man
resumed:

â€œyou wouldnâ€™t think of wantinâ€™ more than ten dollars for that ar chap,
seeing you _must_ get him off yer hand, any how?â€

haley shook his head, and spit impressively.

â€œthat wonâ€™t do, no ways,â€ he said, and began his smoking again.

â€œwell, stranger, what will you take?â€

â€œwell, now,â€ said haley, â€œi _could_ raise that ar chap myself, or get
him raised; heâ€™s oncommon likely and healthy, and heâ€™d fetch a hundred
dollars, six months hence; and, in a year or two, heâ€™d bring two
hundred, if i had him in the right spot; i shanâ€™t take a cent less nor
fifty for him now.â€

â€œo, stranger! thatâ€™s rediculous, altogether,â€ said the man.

â€œfact!â€ said haley, with a decisive nod of his head.

â€œiâ€™ll give thirty for him,â€ said the stranger, â€œbut not a cent more.â€

â€œnow,

renewed decision. â€œiâ€™ll split the difference, and say forty-five; and
thatâ€™s the most i will do.â€

â€œwell, agreed!â€ said the man, after an interval.

â€œdone!â€ said haley. â€œwhere do you land?â€

â€œat louisville,â€ said the man.

â€œlouisville,â€ said haley. â€œvery fair, we get there about dusk. chap will
be asleep,--all fair,--get him off quietly, and no screaming,--happens
beautiful,--i like to do everything quietly,--i hates all kind of
agitation and fluster.â€ and so, after a transfer of certain bills had
passed from the manâ€™s pocket-book to the traderâ€™s, he resumed his cigar.

it was a bright, tranquil evening when the boat stopped at the wharf at
louisville. the woman had been sitting with her baby in her arms, now
wrapped in a heavy s

stily laid the child down in a little cradle formed by the
hollow among the boxes, first carefully spreading under it her cloak;
and then she sprung to the side of the boat, in hopes that, among the
various hotel-waiters who thronged the wharf, she might see her husband.
in this hope, she pressed forward to the front rails, and, stretching
far over them, strained her eyes intently on the moving heads on the
shore, and the crowd pressed in between her and the child.

â€œnowâ€™s your time,â€ said haley, taking the sleeping child up, and handing
him to the stranger. â€œdonâ€™t wake him up, and set him to crying, now;
it would make a devil of a fuss with the gal.â€ the man took the bundle
carefully, and was soon lost in the crowd that went up the wharf.

when the boat, creaking, and groaning, and puffing, had loosed from
the wharf, and was beginning slowly to strain herself along, the woman
returned to her old seat. the trader was sitting there,--the child was
gone!

moves heavily onward to the nearing mart. we must look some time among
its crowded decks before we shall find again our humble friend tom. high
on the upper deck, in a little nook among the everywhere predominant
cotton-bales, at last we may find him.

partly from confidence inspired by mr. shelbyâ€™s representations, and
partly from the remarkably inoffensive and quiet character of the man,
tom had insensibly won his way far into the confidence even of such a
man as haley.

at first he had watched him narrowly through the day, and never allowed
him to sleep at night unfettered; but the uncomplaining patience and
apparent contentment of tomâ€™s manner led him gradually to discontinue
these restraints, and for some time tom had enjoyed a sort of parole
of honor, being permitted to come and go freely where he pleased on the
boat.

emergency which occurred among the workmen below, he had won the go

ad the soft, impressible nature of his kindly race, ever
yearning toward the simple and childlike, watched the little creature
with daily increasing interest. to him she seemed something almost
divine; and whenever her golden head and deep blue eyes peered out upon
him from behind some dusky cotton-bale, or looked down upon him over
some ridge of packages, he half believed that he saw one of the angels
stepped out of his new testament.

often and often she walked mournfully round the place where haleyâ€™s gang
of men and women sat in their chains. she would glide in among them,
and look at them with an air of perplexed and sorrowful earnestness; and
sometimes she would lift their chains with her slender hands, and then
sigh wofully, as she glided away. several times she appeared suddenly
among them, with her hands full of candy, nuts, and oranges, which she
would distribute joyfully to them, and then be gone again.

ession was wholly different. in
the large, clear blue eyes, though in form and color exactly similar,
there was wanting that misty, dreamy depth of expression; all was clear,
bold, and bright, but with a light wholly of this world: the beautifully
cut mouth had a proud and somewhat sarcastic expression, while an air
of free-and-easy superiority sat not ungracefully in every turn and
movement of his fine form. he was listening, with a good-humored,
negligent air, half comic, half contemptuous, to haley, who was very
volubly expatiating on the quality of the article for which they were
bargaining.

â€œall the moral and christian virtues bound in black morocco, complete!â€
 he said, when haley had finished. â€œwell, now, my good fellow, whatâ€™s
the damage, as they say in kentucky; in short, whatâ€™s to be paid out for
this business? how much are you going to cheat me, now? out with it!â€

â€œrather hard on a fellow that pays extra on religion, and canâ€™t trade
with it in the state where he wants it most, anâ€™t it, now?â€ said
the young man, who had been making out a roll of bills while he was
speaking. â€œthere, count your money, old boy!â€ he added, as he handed the
roll to the trader.

â€œall right,â€ said haley, his face beaming with delight; and pulling out
an old inkhorn, he proceeded to fill out a bill of sale, which, in a few
moments, he handed to the young man.

â€œi wonder, now, if i was divided up and inventoried,â€ said the latter
as he ran over the paper, â€œhow much i might bring. say so much for the
shape of my head, so much for a high forehead, so much for arms, and
hands, and legs, and then so much for education, learning, talent,
