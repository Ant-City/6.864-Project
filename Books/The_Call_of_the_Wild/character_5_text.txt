because men, groping in the arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal,
and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the
find, thousands of men were rushing into the northland. these men wanted
dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by
which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost.

buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed santa clara valley. judge
miller’s place, it was called. it stood back from the road, half hidden
among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide
cool veranda that ran around its four sides. the house was approached by
gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and
under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. at the rear things were on
even a more spacious scale than at the front. there were great stables,
where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad servants’
cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grap

ed the rope with quiet dignity. to be sure, it was an
unwonted performance: but he had learned to trust in men he knew, and to
give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own. but when the ends
of the rope were placed in the stranger’s hands, he growled menacingly.
he had merely intimated his displeasure, in his pride believing that to
intimate was to command. but to his surprise the rope tightened around
his neck, shutting off his breath. in quick rage he sprang at the man,
who met him halfway, grappled him close by the throat, and with a deft
twist threw him over on his back. then the rope tightened mercilessly,
while buck struggled in a fury, his tongue lolling out of his mouth and
his great chest panting futilely. never in all his life had he been so
vilely treated, and never in all his life had he been so angry. but his
strength ebbed, his eyes glazed, and he knew nothing when the train was
flagged and the two men threw him into the baggage car.

the kidnapper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated
hand. “if i don’t get the hydrophoby--”

“it’ll be because you was born to hang,” laughed the saloon-keeper.
“here, lend me a hand before you pull your freight,” he added.

dazed, suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue, with the life
half throttled out of him, buck attempted to face his tormentors. but he
was thrown down and choked repeatedly, till they succeeded in filing the
heavy brass collar from off his neck. then the rope was removed, and he
was flung into a cagelike crate.

there he lay for the remainder of the weary night, nursing his wrath and
wounded pride. he could not understand what it all meant. what did they
want with him, these strange men? why were they keeping him pent up in
this narrow crate? he did not know

then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on
the nose. all the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the
exquisite agony of this. with a roar that was almost lionlike in its
ferocity, he again hurled himself at the man. but the man, shifting the
club from right to left, coolly caught him by the under jaw, at the same
time wrenching downward and backward. buck described a complete circle
in the air, and half of another, then crashed to the ground on his head
and chest.

for the last time he rushed. the man struck the shrewd blow he had
purposely withheld for so long, and buck crumpled up and went down,
knocked utterly senseless.

“he’s no slouch at dog-breakin’, that’s wot i say,” one of the men on
the wall cried enthusiastically.

“druther break cayuses any day, and twice on sundays,” was the reply of
the driver, as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses.

nd from there he watched the man in the red sweater.

“‘answers to the name of buck,’” the man soliloquized, quoting from the
saloon-keeper’s letter which had announced the consignment of the crate
and contents. “well, buck, my boy,” he went on in a genial voice, “we’ve
had our little ruction, and the best thing we can do is to let it go at
that. you’ve learned your place, and i know mine. be a good dog and all
‘ll go well and the goose hang high. be a bad dog, and i’ll whale the
stuffin’ outa you. understand?”

as he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded,
and though buck’s hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand,
he endured it without protest. when the man brought him water he drank
eagerly, and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat, chunk by chunk,
from the man’s hand.

he was beaten (he knew that); but he was not broken. he saw, once for
all, that he stood no chance against a man with a club. he had learned

son, and in all his after life he never forgot it. that club was
a revelation. it was his introduction to the reign of primitive law,
and he met the introduction halfway. the facts of life took on a fiercer
aspect; and while he faced that aspect uncowed, he faced it with all the
latent cunning of his nature aroused. as the days went by, other dogs
came, in crates and at the ends of ropes, some docilely, and some raging
and roaring as he had come; and, one and all, he watched them pass
under the dominion of the man in the red sweater. again and again, as he
looked at each brutal performance, the lesson was driven home to buck:

the canadian government would be no loser, nor would its
despatches travel the slower. perrault knew dogs, and when he looked at
buck he knew that he was one in a thousand--“one in ten t’ousand,” he
commented mentally.

buck saw money pass between them, and was not surprised when curly, a
good-natured newfoundland, and he were led away by the little weazened
man. that was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater, and as
curly and he looked at receding seattle from the deck of the narwhal, it
was the last he saw of the warm southland. curly and he were taken below
by perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant called francois.
perrault was a french-canadian, and swarthy; but francois was a
french-canadian half-breed, and twice as swarthy. they were a new kind
of men to buck (of which he was destined to see many more), and while
he developed no affection for them, he none the less grew honestly to
respect them. he speedily learned that perrault and francois were fair
men, cal

way of dogs to be fooled by dogs.

in the ‘tween-decks of the narwhal, buck and curly joined two other
dogs. one of them was a big, snow-white fellow from spitzbergen who had
been brought away by a whaling captain, and who had later accompanied
a geological survey into the barrens. he was friendly, in a treacherous
sort of way, smiling into one’s face the while he meditated some
underhand trick, as, for instance, when he stole from buck’s food at the
first meal. as buck sprang to punish him, the lash of francois’s whip
sang through the air, reaching the culprit first; and nothing remained
to buck but to recover the bone. that was fair of francois, he decided,
and the half-breed began his

 rise in buck’s estimation.

the other dog made no advances, nor received any; also, he did not
attempt to steal from the newcomers. he was a gloomy, morose fellow, and
he showed curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone, and
further, that there would be trouble if he were not left alone. “dave”
 he was called, and he ate and slept, or yawned between times, and took
interest in nothing, not even when the narwhal crossed queen charlotte
sound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing possessed. when
buck and curly grew excited, half wild with fear, he raised his head as
though annoyed, favored them with an incurious glance, yawned, and went
to sleep again.

day and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller,
and though one day was very like another, it was apparent to buck that
the weather was steadily growing colder. at last, one morning, the
propeller was quiet, and the narwha

first experience taught him an unforgetable lesson. it is true, it was
a vicarious experience, else he would not have lived to profit by it.
curly was the victim. they were camped near the log store, where she, in
her friendly way, made advances to a husky dog the size of a full-grown
wolf, though not half so large as she. there was no warning, only a leap
in like a flash, a metallic clip of teeth, a leap out equally swift, and
curly’s face was ripped open from eye to jaw.

it was the wolf manner of fighting, to strike and leap away; but there
was more to it than this. thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and
surrounded the combatants in an intent and silent circle. buck did not
comprehend that silent intentness, nor the eager way with which they
were licking their chops. curly rushed her a

so sudden was it, and so unexpected, that buck was taken aback. he saw
spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing; and he saw
francois, swinging an axe, spring into the mess of dogs. three men
with clubs were helping him to scatter them. it did not take long. two
minutes from the time curly went down, the last of her assailants were
clubbed off. but she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody, trampled
snow, almost literally torn to pieces, the swart half-breed standing
over her and cursing horribly. the scene often came back to buck to
trouble him in his sleep. so that was the way. no fair play. once down,
that was the end of you. well, he would see to it that he never went
down. spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again, and from that moment
buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred.

before he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing
of curly, he received another shock. francois fastened upon him an

buck had been purposely placed between dave and sol-leks so that he
might receive instruction. apt scholar that he was, they were equally
apt teachers, never allowing him to linger long in error, and enforcing
their teaching with their sharp teeth. dave was fair and very wise. he
never nipped buck without cause, and he never failed to nip him when he
stood in need of it. as francois’s whip backed him up, buck found it
to be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate. once, during a brief
halt, when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start, both
dave and solleks flew at him and administered a sound trouncing. the
resulting tangle was even worse, but buck took good care to keep the
traces clear thereafter; and ere the day was done, so well had he
mastered his work, his mates about ceased nagging him. francois’s whip
snapped less frequently, and perrault even honored buck by lifting up
his feet and carefully examining them.

day after day, for days unending, buck toiled in the traces. always,
they broke camp in the dark, and the first gray of dawn found them
hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them. and always
they pitched camp after dark, eating their bit of fish, and crawling
to sleep into the snow. buck was ravenous. the pound and a half of
sun-dried salmon, which was his ration for each day, seemed to go
nowhere. he never had enough, and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs.
yet the other dogs, because they weighed less and were born to the life,
received a pound only of the fish and managed to keep in good condition.

fully half their grub supply was gone. the huskies had chewed through
the sled lashings and canvas coverings. in fact, nothing, no matter how
remotely eatable, had escaped them. they had eaten a pair of perrault’s
moose-hide moccasins, chunks out of the leather traces, and even two
feet of lash from the end of francois’s whip. he broke from a mournful
contemplation of it to look over his wounded dogs.

nothing daunted him. it was because nothing daunted him that he had been
chosen for government courier. he took all manner of risks, resolutely
thrusting his little weazened face into the frost and struggling on from
dim dawn to dark. he skirted the frowning shores on rim ice that bent
and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not halt. once, the
sled broke through, with dave and buck, and they were half-frozen and
all but drowned by the time they were dragged out. the usual fire was
necessary to save them. they were coated solidly with ice, and the two
men kept them on the run around the fire, sweating and thawing, so close
that they were singed by the flames.

at another time spitz went through, dragging the whole team after him up
to buck, who strained backward with all his strength, his fore paws on

his had softened during the many generations since the day his last
wild ancestor was tamed by a cave-dweller or river man. all day long he
limped in agony, and camp once made, lay down like a dead dog. hungry as
he was, he would not move to receive his ration of fish, which francois
had to bring to him. also, the dog-driver rubbed buck’s feet for half
an hour each night after supper, and sacrificed the tops of his own
moccasins to make four moccasins for buck. this was a great relief, and
buck caused even the weazened face of perrault to twist itself into a
grin one morning, when francois forgot the moccasins and buck lay on his
back, his four feet waving appealingly in the air, and refused to budge
without them. later his feet grew hard to the trail, and the worn-out
foot-gear was thrown away.

shrewdly managed, that spitz was hurled backward and off his feet. pike,
who had been trembling abjectly, took heart at this open mutiny,
and sprang upon his overthrown leader. buck, to whom fair play was a
forgotten code, likewise sprang upon spitz. but francois, chuckling at
the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice, brought
his lash down upon buck with all his might. this failed to drive buck
from his prostrate rival, and the butt of the whip was brought into
play. half-stunned by the blow, buck was knocked backward and the lash
laid upon him again and again, while spitz soundly punished the many
times offending pike.

in the days that followed, as dawson grew closer and closer, buck still
continued to interfere between spitz and the culprits; but he did it
craftily, when francois was not around, with the covert mutiny of buck,
a general insubordination sprang up and increased. dave and sol-leks
were unaffected, but the rest of the team went from bad to worse

buck met southland dogs, but in the main
they were the wild wolf husky breed. every night, regularly, at nine, at
twelve, at three, they lifted a nocturnal song, a weird and eerie chant,
in which it was buck’s delight to join.

with the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead, or the stars leaping
in the frost dance, and the land numb and frozen under its pall of snow,
this song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life, only it
was pitched in minor key, with long-drawn wailings and half-sobs, and
was more the pleading of life, the articulate travail of existence. it
was an old song, old as the breed itself--one of the first songs of the
younger world in a day when songs were sad. it was invested with the woe
of unnumbered generations, this plaint by which buck was so strangely
stirred. when he moaned and sobbed, it was with the pain of living that
was of old the pain of his wild fathers, and the fear and mystery of the
cold and dark that was to them fear and mystery. and that

but such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble and
vexation on the part of francois. the insidious revolt led by buck
had destroyed the solidarity of the team. it no longer was as one dog
leaping in the traces. the encouragement buck gave the rebels led them
into all kinds of petty misdemeanors. no more was spitz a leader greatly
to be feared. the old awe departed, and they grew equal to challenging
his authority. pike robbed him of half a fish one night, and gulped
it down under the protection of buck. another night dub and joe fought
spitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved. and even
billee, the good-natured, was less good-natured, and whined not half
so placatingly as in former days. buck never came near spitz without
snarling and bristling menacingly. in fact, his conduct approached that
of a bully, and he was given to swaggering up and down before spitz’s

upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists

there was no hope for him. buck was inexorable. mercy was a thing
reserved for gentler climes. he manoeuvred for the final rush. the
circle had tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on
his flanks. he could see them, beyond spitz and to either side, half
crouching for the spring, their eyes fixed upon him. a pause seemed to
fall. every animal was motionless as though turned to stone. only spitz
quivered and bristled as he staggered back and forth, snarling with
horrible menace, as though to frighten off impending death. then buck
sprang in and out; but while he was in, shoulder had at last squarely
met shoulder. the dark circle became a dot on the moon-flooded snow as
spitz disappeared from view. buck stood and looked on, the successful

ere deluged with invitations to drink, while
the team was the constant centre of a worshipful crowd of dog-busters
and mushers. then three or four western bad men aspired to clean out
the town, were riddled like pepper-boxes for their pains, and public
interest turned to other idols. next came official orders. francois
called buck to him, threw his arms around him, wept over him. and that
was the last of francois and perrault. like other men, they passed out
of buck’s life for good.

a scotch half-breed took charge of him and his mates, and in company
with a dozen other dog-teams he started back over the weary trail to
dawson. it was no light running now, nor record time, but heavy toil
each day, with a heavy load behind; for this was the mail train,
carrying word from the world to the men who sought gold under the shadow
of the pole.

buck did not like it, but he bore up well to the work, taking pride in
it after the manner of dave and sol-leks, and seeing that his mates,
whether they

 no power over him. far more potent were
the memories of his heredity that gave things he had never seen before
a seeming familiarity; the instincts (which were but the memories of
his ancestors become habits) which had lapsed in later days, and still
later, in him, quickened and become alive again.

sometimes as he crouched there, blinking dreamily at the flames, it
seemed that the flames were of another fire, and that as he crouched
by this other fire he saw another and different man from the half-breed
cook before him. this other man was shorter of leg and longer of arm,
with muscles that were stringy and knotty rather than rounded and
swelling. the hair of this man was long and matted, and his head slanted
back under it from the eyes. he uttered strange sounds, and seemed very
much afraid of the darkness, into which he peered continually, clutching
in his hand, which hung midway between knee and foot, a stick with a
heavy stone made fast to the end. he was all but naked, a ragged and

eyes of great beasts of prey. and he could hear the crashing of their
bodies through the undergrowth, and the noises they made in the night.
and dreaming there by the yukon bank, with lazy eyes blinking at the
fire, these sounds and sights of another world would make the hair to
rise along his back and stand on end across his shoulders and up his
neck, till he whimpered low and suppressedly, or growled softly, and the
half-breed cook shouted at him, “hey, you buck, wake up!” whereupon the
other world would vanish and the real world come into his eyes, and he
would get up and yawn and stretch as though he had been asleep.

it was a hard trip, with the mail behind them, and the heavy work wore
them down. they were short of weight and in poor condition when they
made dawson, and should have had a ten days’ or a week’s rest at
least. but in two days’ time they dropped down the yukon bank from the
barracks,

he was brought from his nest to the fire and was pressed and prodded
till he cried out many times. something was wrong inside, but they could
locate no broken bones, could not make it out.

by the time cassiar bar was reached, he was so weak that he was falling
repeatedly in the traces. the scotch half-breed called a halt and took
him out of the team, making the next dog, sol-leks, fast to the sled.
his intention was to rest dave, letting him run free behind the sled.
sick as he was, dave resented being taken out, grunting and growling
while the traces were unfastened, and whimpering broken-heartedly when
he saw sol-leks in the position he had held and served so long. for the
pride of trace and trail was his, and, sick unto death, he could not
bear that another dog should do his work.

when

the sled started, he floundered in the soft snow alongside the
beaten trail, attacking sol-leks with his teeth, rushing against him and
trying to thrust him off into the soft snow on the other side, striving
to leap inside his traces and get between him and the sled, and all the
while whining and yelping and crying with grief and pain. the half-breed
tried to drive him away with the whip; but he paid no heed to the
stinging lash, and the man had not the heart to strike harder. dave
refused to run quietly on the trail behind the sled, where the going was
easy, but continued to flounder alongside in the soft snow, where the
going was most difficult, till exhausted. then he fell, and lay where he
fell, howling lugubriously as the long train of sleds churned by.

with the last remnant of his strength he managed to stagger along behind

ell. then he wormed his way forward slowly
toward where the harnesses were being put on his mates. he would advance
his fore legs and drag up his body with a sort of hitching movement,
when he would advance his fore legs and hitch ahead again for a few more
inches. his strength left him, and the last his mates saw of him he lay
gasping in the snow and yearning toward them. but they could hear him
mournfully howling till they passed out of sight behind a belt of river
timber.

here the train was halted. the scotch half-breed slowly retraced his
steps to the camp they had left. the men ceased talking. a revolver-shot
rang out. the man came back hurriedly. the whips snapped, the bells
tinkled merrily, the sleds churned along the trail; but buck knew, and
every dog knew, what had taken place behind the belt of river trees.




chapter v. the toil of trace and trail


thirty days from the time it left dawson, the salt water mail, with buck
and his mates at the fore, arrived at skaguay. they we

fresh batches of hudson bay dogs were to take the places of those
worthless for the trail. the worthless ones were to be got rid of, and,
since dogs count for little against dollars, they were to be sold.

three days passed, by which time buck and his mates found how really
tired and weak they were. then, on the morning of the fourth day, two
men from the states came along and bought them, harness and all, for a
song. the men addressed each other as “hal” and “charles.” charles was
a middle-aged, lightish-colored man, with weak and watery eyes and a
mustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up, giving the lie to the
limply drooping lip it concealed. hal was a youngster of nineteen or
twenty, with a big colt’s revolver and a hunting-knife strapped about
him on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges. this belt was the
most salient thing about him. it advertised his callowness--a callowness
sheer and unutterable. both men were man

ifestly out of place, and why
such as they should adventure the north is part of the mystery of things
that passes understanding.

buck heard the chaffering, saw the money pass between the man and the
government agent, and knew that the scotch half-breed and the mail-train
drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of perrault and
francois and the others who had gone before. when driven with his mates
to the new owners’ camp, buck saw a slipshod and slovenly affair, tent
half stretched, dishes unwashed, everything in disorder; also, he saw a
woman. “mercedes” the men called her. she was charles’s wife and hal’s
sister--a nice family party.

buck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the tent
and load the sled. there was a great deal of effort about their manner,
but no businesslike method. the tent was rolled into an awkward bundle
three times as large as it should have been. the tin dishes were packed
away unwashed. mercedes continuall

winking at one another.

“you’ve got a right smart load as it is,” said one of them; “and it’s
not me should tell you your business, but i wouldn’t tote that tent
along if i was you.”

“undreamed of!” cried mercedes, throwing up her hands in dainty dismay.
“however in the world could i manage without a tent?”

“it’s springtime, and you won’t get any more cold weather,” the man
replied.

she shook her head decidedly, and charles and hal put the last odds and
ends on top the mountainous load.

“think it’ll ride?” one of the men asked.

“why shouldn’t it?” charles demanded rather shortly.

“oh, that’s all right, that’s all right,” the man hastened meekly to
say. “i was just a-wonderin’, that is all. it seemed a mite top-heavy.”

charles turned his back and drew the lashings down as well as he could,
which was not in the least well.

“an’ of course the dogs can hike along all day with that contraptio

behind them,” affirmed a second of the men.

“certainly,” said hal, with freezing politeness, taking hold of the
gee-pole with one hand and swinging his whip from the other. “mush!” he
shouted. “mush on there!”

the dogs sprang against the breast-bands, strained hard for a few
moments, then relaxed. they were unable to move the sled.

“the lazy brutes, i’ll show them,” he cried, preparing to lash out at
them with the whip.

but mercedes interfered, crying, “oh, hal, you mustn’t,” as she caught
hold of the whip and wrenched it from him. “the poor dears! now you
must promise you won’t be harsh with them for the rest of the trip, or i
won’t go a step.”

“precious lot you know about dogs,” her brother sneered; “and i wish
you’d leave me alone. they’re lazy, i tell you, and you’ve got to whip
them to get anything out of them. that’s their way. you ask any one. ask
one of those men.”

mercedes looked at them imploringly, untold repug

written in her pretty face.

“they’re weak as water, if you want to know,” came the reply from one
of the men. “plum tuckered out, that’s what’s the matter. they need a
rest.”

“rest be blanked,” said hal, with his beardless lips; and mercedes said,
“oh!” in pain and sorrow at the oath.

but she was a clannish creature, and rushed at once to the defence of
her brother. “never mind that man,” she said pointedly. “you’re driving
our dogs, and you do what you think best with them.”

again hal’s whip fell upon the dogs. they threw themselves against the
breast-bands, dug their feet into the packed snow, got down low to it,
and put forth all their strength. the sled held as though it

one of the onlookers, who had been clenching his teeth to suppress hot
speech, now spoke up:--

“it’s not that i care a whoop what becomes of you, but for the dogs’
sakes i just want to tell you, you can help them a mighty lot by
breaking out that sled. the runners are froze fast. throw your weight
against the gee-pole, right and left, and break it out.”

a third time the attempt was made, but this time, following the advice,
hal broke out the runners which had been frozen to the snow. the
overloaded and unwieldy sled forged ahead, buck and his mates struggling
frantically under the rain of blows. a hundred yards ahead the path
turned and sloped steeply into the main street. it would have required
an experienced man to keep the top-heavy sled upright, and hal was not
such a man. as they swung on the turn the sled went over, spilling
half its load through the loose lashings. the dogs never stopped. the

nded on its side behind them. they were angry because
of the ill treatment they had received and the unjust load. buck was
raging. he broke into a run, the team following his lead. hal cried
“whoa! whoa!” but they gave no heed. he tripped and was pulled off his
feet. the capsized sled ground over him, and the dogs dashed on up the
street, adding to the gayety of skaguay as they scattered the remainder
of the outfit along its chief thoroughfare.

kind-hearted citizens caught the dogs and gathered up the scattered
belongings. also, they gave advice. half the load and twice the dogs,
if they ever expected to reach dawson, was what was said. hal and
his sister and brother-in-

law listened unwillingly, pitched tent, and
overhauled the outfit. canned goods were turned out that made men laugh,
for canned goods on the long trail is a thing to dream about. “blankets
for a hotel” quoth one of the men who laughed and helped. “half as
many is too much; get rid of them. throw away that tent, and all those
dishes,--who’s going to wash them, anyway? good lord, do you think
you’re travelling on a pullman?”

and so it went, the inexorable elimination of the superfluous. mercedes
cried when her clothes-bags were dumped on the ground and article
after article was thrown out. she cried in general, and she cried in
particular over each discarded thing. she clasped hands about knees,
rocking back and forth broken-heartedly.

she averred she would not go
an inch, not for a dozen charleses. she appealed to everybody and to
everything, finally wiping her eyes and proceeding to cast out even
articles of apparel that were imperative necessaries. and in her zeal,
when she had finished with her own, she attacked the belongings of her
men and went through them like a tornado.

this accomplished, the outfit, though cut in half, was still a
formidable bulk. charles and hal went out in the evening and bought six
outside dogs. these, added to the six of the original team, and teek
and koona, the huskies obtained at the rink rapids on the record
trip, brought the team up to fourteen. but the outside dogs, though
practically broken in since their landing, did not amount to much. three
were short-haired pointers, one was a newfoundland, and the other
two were mongrels of indeterminate breed. they did not seem to know
anything, these newcomers. buck and his comrades lo

uous trail, the outlook was anything
but bright. the two men, however, were quite cheerful. and they were
proud, too. they were doing the thing in style, with fourteen dogs. they
had seen other sleds depart over the pass for dawson, or come in from
dawson, but never had they seen a sled with so many as fourteen dogs. in
the nature of arctic travel there was a reason why fourteen dogs should
not drag one sled, and that was that one sled could not carry the food
for fourteen dogs. but charles and hal did not know this. they had
worked the trip out with a pencil, so much to a dog, so many dogs,
so many days, q.e.d. mercedes looked over their shoulders and nodded
comprehensively, it was all so very simple.

late next morning buck led the long team up the street. there was
nothing lively about it, no snap or go in him and his fellows. they were
starting dead weary. four times he had covered the distance between salt
water and dawson, and the knowledge that, jaded and tired, he was facing

ame trail once more, made him bitter. his heart was not in
the work, nor was the heart of any dog. the outsides were timid and
frightened, the insides without confidence in their masters.

buck felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men and the
woman. they did not know how to do anything, and as the days went by
it became apparent that they could not learn. they were slack in all
things, without order or discipline. it took them half the night to
pitch a slovenly camp, and half the morning to break that camp and get
the sled loaded in fashion so slovenly that for the rest of the day they
were occupied in stopping and rearranging the load. some days they did
not make ten miles. on other days they were unable to get started
at all. and on no day did they succeed in making more than half the
distance used by the men as a basis in their dog-food computation.

it was inevitable that they should go short on dog-food. but they
hastened it by overfeeding, bringing the day ne

arer when underfeeding
would commence. the outside dogs, whose digestions had not been trained
by chronic famine to make the most of little, had voracious appetites.
and when, in addition to this, the worn-out huskies pulled weakly, hal
decided that the orthodox ration was too small. he doubled it. and to
cap it all, when mercedes, with tears in her pretty eyes and a quaver
in her throat, could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more, she
stole from the fish-sacks and fed them slyly. but it was not food that
buck and the huskies needed, but rest. and though they were making poor
time, the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely.

then came the underfeeding. hal awoke one day to the fact that his
dog-food 
 
 ___________________________
 
was half gone and the distance only quarter covered; further,
that for love or money no additional dog-food was to be obtained. so
he cut down even the orthodox ration and tried to increase the day’s
travel. his sister and brother-in-law seconded him; but they were
frustrated by their heavy outfit and their own incompetence. it was a
simple matter to give the dogs less food; but it was impossible to
make the dogs travel faster, while their own inability to get under way
earlier in the morning prevent

ed them from travelling longer hours. not
only did they not know how to work dogs, but they did not know how to
work themselves.

the first to go was dub. poor blundering thief that he was, always
getting caught and punished, he had none the less been a faithful
worker. his wrenched shoulder-blade, untreated and unrested, went from
bad to worse, till finally hal shot him with the big colt’s revolver. it
is a saying of the country that an outside dog starves to death on the
ration of the husky, so the six outside dogs under buck could do no less
than die on half the ration of the husky. the newfoundland went first,
followed by the three short-haired pointers, the two mongrels hanging
more grittily on to life, but going in the end.

by this time all the amenities and gentlenesses of the southland had
fallen away from the three people. shorn of its glam

isery, increased with it, doubled
upon it, outdistanced it. the wonderful patience of the trail which
comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore, and remain sweet of speech
and kindly, did not come to these two men and the woman. they had no
inkling of such a patience. they were stiff and in pain; their muscles
ached, their bones ached, their very hearts ached; and because of this
they became sharp of speech, and hard words were first on their lips in
the morning and last at night.

charles and hal wrangled whenever mercedes gave them a chance. it was
the cherished belief of each that he did more than his share of the
work, and neither forbore to speak this belief at every opportunity.
sometimes mercedes sided with her husband, sometimes with her brother.
the result was a beautiful and unending family quarrel. starting from
a dispute as to which should chop a few sticks for the fire (a dispute
which concerned only charles and hal), presently would be lugged in the
rest of the family, fath

ers, mothers, uncles, cousins, people thousands
of miles away, and some of them dead. that hal’s views on art, or the
sort of society plays his mother’s brother wrote, should have
anything to do with the chopping of a few sticks of firewood, passes
comprehension; nevertheless the quarrel was as likely to tend in that
direction as in the direction of charles’s political prejudices. and
that charles’s sister’s tale-bearing tongue should be relevant to the
building of a yukon fire, was apparent only to mercedes, who disburdened
herself of copious opinions upon that topic, and inci

few other traits unpleasantly peculiar to her husband’s family. in the
meantime the fire remained unbuilt, the camp half pitched, and the dogs
unfed.

mercedes nursed a special grievance--the grievance of sex. she was
pretty and soft, and had been chivalrously treated all her days. but
the present treatment by her husband and brother was everything save
chivalrous. it was her custom to be helpless. they complained. upon
which impeachment of what to her was her most essential sex-prerogative,
she made their lives unendurable. she no longer considered the dogs, and
because she was sore and tired, she persisted in

riding on the sled. she
was pretty and soft, but she weighed one hundred and twenty pounds--a
lusty last straw to the load dragged by the weak and starving animals.
she rode for days, till they fell in the traces and the sled stood
still. charles and hal begged her to get off and walk, pleaded with her,
entreated, the while she wept and importuned heaven with a recital of
their brutality.

on one occasion they took her off the sled by main strength. they never
did it again. she let her legs go limp like a spoiled child, and sat
down on the trail. they went on their way, but she did not move. after
they had travelled three miles they unloaded the sled, came back for
her, and by main strength put her on the sled again.

in the excess of their own

 misery they were callous to the suffering of
their animals. hal’s theory, which he practised on others, was that one
must get hardened. he had started out preaching it to his sister and
brother-in-law. failing there, he hammered it into the dogs with a club.
at the five fingers the dog-food gave out, and a toothless old squaw
offered to trade them a few pounds of frozen horse-hide for the colt’s
revolver that kept the big hunting-knife company at hal’s hip. a poor
substitute for food was this hide, just as it had been stripped from the
starved horses of the cattlemen six months back. in its frozen state it
was more like strips of galvanized iron, and when a dog wrestled it into
his stomach it thawed into thin and innutritious leathery strings and
into a mass of short hair, irritating and indigestible.

and through it all buck staggered along at the head of the team as in
a nightmare. he pulled when he could; when he could no longer pull,

fell down and remained down till blows from whip or club drove him
to his feet again. all the stiffness and gloss had gone out of his
beautiful furry coat. the hair hung down, limp and draggled, or matted
with dried blood where hal’s club had bruised him. his muscles had
wasted away to knotty strings, and the flesh pads had disappeared, so
that each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly
through the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness. it was
heartbreaking, only buck’s heart was unbreakable. the man in the red
sweater had proved that.

as it was with buck, so was it with his mates. they were perambulating
skeletons. there were seven all together, including him. in their very
great misery

they had become insensible to the bite of the lash or the
bruise of the club. the pain of the beating was dull and distant,
just as the things their eyes saw and their ears heard seemed dull and
distant. they were not half living, or quarter living. they were simply
so many bags of bones in which sparks of life fluttered faintly. when a
halt was made, they dropped down in the traces like dead dogs, and the
spark dimmed and paled and seemed to go out. and when the club or whip
fell upon them, the spark fluttered feebly up, and they tottered to
their feet and staggered on.

there came a day when billee, the good-natured, fell and could not rise.
hal had traded off his revolver, so he took the axe and knocked billee
on the head as he lay in the traces, then cut the carcass out of the
harness and dragged it to one side. buck saw, and

longer to malinger; sol-leks, the one-eyed, still faithful to the toil
of trace and trail, and mournful in that he had so little strength with
which to pull; teek, who had not travelled so far that winter and who
was now beaten more than the others because he was fresher; and buck,
still at the head of the team, but no longer enforcing discipline or
striving to enforce it, blind with weakness half the time and keeping

g, snapping. the yukon
was straining to break loose the ice that bound it down. it ate away
from beneath; the sun ate from above. air-holes formed, fissures sprang
and spread apart, while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into
the river. and amid all this bursting, rending, throbbing of awakening
life, under the blazing sun and through the soft-sighing breezes, like
wayfarers to death, staggered the two men, the woman, and the huskies.

with the dogs falling, mercedes weeping and riding, hal swearing
innocuously, and charles’s eyes wistfully watering, they staggered into
john thornton’s camp at the mouth of white river. when they halted,
the dogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead. mercedes
dried her eyes and looked at john thornton. charles sat down on a log
to rest. he sat down very slowly and painstakingly what of his great
stiffness. hal did the talking. john thornton was whittling the last
touches on an axe-handle he had made from a stick of birch. he whi

and listened, gave monosyllabic replies, and, when it was asked, terse
advice. he knew the breed, and he gave his advice in the certainty that
it would not be followed.

“they told us up above that the bottom was dropping out of the trail and
that the best thing for us to do was to lay over,” hal said in response
to thornton’s warning to take no more chances on the rotten ice. “they
told us we couldn’t make white river, and here we are.” this last with a
sneering ring of triumph in it.

“and they told you true,” john thornton answered. “the bottom’s likely
to drop out at any moment. only fools, with the blind luck of fools,
could have made it. i tell you straight, i wouldn’t risk my carcass on
that ice for all the gold in alaska.”

“that’s because you’re not a

fool, i suppose,” said hal. “all the same,
we’ll go on to dawson.” he uncoiled his whip. “get up there, buck! hi!
get up there! mush on!”

thornton went on whittling. it was idle, he knew, to get between a fool
and his folly; while two or three fools more or less would not alter the
scheme of things.

but the team did not get up at the command. it had long since passed
into the stage where blows were required to rouse it. the whip flashed
out, here and there, on its merciless errands. john thornton compressed

joe came next, yelping with pain. pike made painful efforts. twice he
fell over, when half up, and on the third attempt managed to rise. buck
made no effort. he lay quietly where he had fallen. the lash bit into
him again and again, but he neither whined nor struggled. several times
thornton started, as though to speak, but changed his mind. a moisture
came into his eyes, and, as the whipping continued, he arose and walked
irresolutely up and down.

this was the first time buck had failed, in itself a sufficient reason
to drive hal into a rage. he exchanged the whip for the customar

 flickered and went down. it was nearly
out. he felt strangely numb. as though from a great distance, he was
aware that he was being beaten. the last sensations of pain left him. he
no longer felt anything, though very faintly he could hear the impact of
the club upon his body. but it was no longer his body, it seemed so far
away.

and then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was
inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, john thornton sprang
upon the man who wielded the club. hal was hurled backward, as
though struck by a falling tree. mercedes screamed. charles looked on
wistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his
stiffness.

john thornton stood over buck, struggling to control himself, too
convulsed with rage to speak.

“if you strike that dog again, i’ll kill you,” he at last managed to say
in a choking voice.

“it’s my dog,” hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came
back. “get out of my way, or i’ll fix you. i’

m going to dawson.”

thornton stood between him and buck, and evinced no intention of getting
out of the way. hal drew his long hunting-knife. mercedes screamed,
cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
thornton rapped hal’s knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking the knife
to the ground. he rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up.
then he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes cut buck’s
traces.

hal had no fight left in him. besides, his hands were full with his
sister, or his arms, rather; while buck was too near dead to be of
further use in hauling the sled. a few minutes later they pulled out
from the bank and down the river. buck heard them go and raised his head
to see, pike was leading, sol-leks was at the wheel, and between were
joe and teek. they were limping and staggering. mercedes was riding the
loaded sled. hal guided at the gee-pole, and charles stumbled along in
the rear.

 buck watched them, thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly
hands searched for broken bones. by the time his search had disclosed
nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the
sled was a quarter of a mile away. dog and man watched it crawling along
over the ice. suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into a rut,
and the gee-pole, with hal clinging to it, jerk into the air. mercedes’s
scream came to their ears. they saw charles turn and make one step to
run back, and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans
disappear. a yawning hole was all that was to be seen. the bottom had
dropped out of the trail.

john thornton and buck looked at each other.

“you poor devil,” said john thornton, and buck licked his hand.

buck, who, in a dying condition, was unable to resent her first
advances. she had the doctor trait which some dogs possess; and as a
mother cat washes her kittens, so she washed and cleansed buck’s
wounds. regularly, each morning after he had finished his breakfast,
she performed her self-appointed task, till he came to look for her
ministrations as much as he did for thornton’s. nig, equally friendly,
though less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and
half deerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature.

to buck’s surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him. they
seemed to share the kindliness and largeness of john thornton. as buck
grew stronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games, in
which thornton himself could not forbear to join; and in this fashion
buck romped through his convalescence and into a new existence. love,
genuine passionate love, was his for the first time. this he

his heart shining out of his eyes as buck’s heart shone out.

for a long time after his rescue, buck did not like thornton to get out
of his sight. from the moment he left the tent to when he entered it
again, buck would follow at his heels. his transient masters since he
had come into the northland had bred in him a fear that no master could
be permanent. he was afraid that thornton would pass out of his life as
perrault and francois and the scotch half-breed had passed out. even in
the night, in his dreams, he was haunted by this fear. at such times
he would shake off sleep and creep through the chill to the flap of
the tent, where he would stand and listen to the sound of his master’s
breathing.

but in spite of this great love he bore john thornton, which seemed
to bespeak the soft civilizing influence, the strain of the primitive,
which the northland had aroused in him, remained alive and active.

of the depths of time, he obeyed.

he was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn. he
linked the past with the present, and the eternity behind him throbbed
through him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and
seasons swayed. he sat by john thornton’s fire, a broad-breasted dog,
white-fanged and long-furred; but behind him were the shades of all
manner of dogs, half-wolves and wild wolves, urgent and prompting,
tasting the savor of the meat he ate, thirsting for the water he drank,
scenting the wind with him, listening with him and telling him the
sounds made by the wild life in the forest, dictating his moods,
directing his actions, lying down to sleep with him when he lay down,
and dreaming with him and beyond him and becoming themselves the stuff
of his dreams.

of that driving current was a matter of minutes, and they ran as fast as
they could up the bank to a point far above where thornton was hanging
on. they attached the line with which they had been snubbing the boat to
buck’s neck and shoulders, being careful that it should neither strangle
him nor impede his swimming, and launched him into the stream. he struck
out boldly, but not straight enough into the stream. he discovered the
mistake too late, when thornton was abreast of him and a bare half-dozen
strokes away while he was being carried helplessly past.

hans promptly snubbed with the rope, as though buck were a boat. the
rope thus tightening on him in the sweep of the current, he was jerked
under the surface, and under the surface he remained till his body
struck against the bank and he was hauled out. he was half drowned, and
hans and pete threw themselves upon him, pounding the breath into him
and the water out of him. he staggered to his feet and fell down. the

of alaskan fame. this exploit was particularly gratifying to the three
men; for they stood in need of the outfit which it furnished, and were
enabled to make a long-desired trip into the virgin east, where miners
had not yet appeared. it was brought about by a conversation in the
eldorado saloon, in which men waxed boastful of their favorite dogs.
buck, because of his record, was the target for these men, and thornton
was driven stoutly to defend him. at the end of half an hour one man
stated that his dog could start a sled with five hundred pounds and
walk off with it; a second bragged six hundred for his dog; and a third,
seven hundred.

“pooh! pooh!” said john thornton; “buck can start a thousand pounds.”

“and break it out? and walk off with it for a hundred yards?” demanded
matthewson, a bonanza king, he of the seven hundred vaunt.

“and break it out, and walk off with it for a hundred yards,” john
thornton said coolly.

could feel a flush of warm blood creeping up his face. his tongue had

half a ton! the enormousness of it appalled him. he had great faith in
buck’s strength and had often thought him capable of starting such a
load; but never, as now, had he faced the possibility of it, the eyes
of a dozen men fixed upon him, silent and waiting. further, he had no
thousand dollars; nor had hans or pete.

th his own harness, was
put into the sled. he had caught the contagion of the excitement, and
he felt that in some way he must do a great thing for john thornton.
murmurs of admiration at his splendid appearance went up. he was in
perfect condition, without an ounce of superfluous flesh, and the one
hundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were so many pounds of grit and
virility. his furry coat shone with the sheen of silk. down the neck and
across the shoulders, his mane, in repose as it was, half bristled and
seemed to lift with every movement, as though excess of vigor made each
particular hair alive and active. the great breast and heavy fore legs
were no more than in proportion with the rest of the body, where the
muscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin. men felt these
muscles and proclaimed them hard as iron, and the odds went down to two
to one.

“gad, sir! gad, sir!” stuttered a member of the latest dynasty, a king
of the skookum benches. “i offer you eight hundre

 he took his head in his two hands
and rested cheek on cheek. he did not playfully shake him, as was his
wont, or murmur soft love curses; but he whispered in his ear. “as you
love me, buck. as you love me,” was what he whispered. buck whined with
suppressed eagerness.

the crowd was watching curiously. the affair was growing mysterious. it
seemed like a conjuration. as thornton got to his feet, buck seized his
mittened hand between his jaws, pressing in with his teeth and releasing
slowly, half-reluctantly. it was the answer, in terms, not of speech,
but of love. thornton stepped well back.

“now, buck,” he said.

buck tightened the traces, then slacked them for a matter of several
inches. it was the way he had learned.

“gee!” thornton’s voice rang out, sharp in the tense silence.

buck swung to the right, ending the movement in a plunge that took up
the slack and with a sudden jerk arrested his one hundred and fifty
pounds. the load quivered, and from under the runners ar

ous of the fact.

“now, mush!”

thornton’s command cracked out like a pistol-shot. buck threw himself
forward, tightening the traces with a jarring lunge. his whole body
was gathered compactly together in the tremendous effort, the muscles
writhing and knotting like live things under the silky fur. his great
chest was low to the ground, his head forward and down, while his
feet were flying like mad, the claws scarring the hard-packed snow in
parallel grooves. the sled swayed and trembled, half-started forward.
one of his feet slipped, and one man groaned aloud. then the sled
lurched ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks, though it
never really came to a dead stop again...half an inch...an inch... two
inches... the jerks perceptibly diminished; as the sled gained momentum,
he caught them up, till it was moving steadily along.

men gasped and began to breathe again, unaware that for a moment they
had ceased to breathe. thornton was running behind, encouraging buck

ort, cheery words. the distance had been measured off, and as he
neared the pile of firewood which marked the end of the hundred yards,
a cheer began to grow and grow, which burst into a roar as he passed
the firewood and halted at command. every man was tearing himself loose,
even matthewson. hats and mittens were flying in the air. men were
shaking hands, it did not matter with whom, and bubbling over in a
general incoherent babel.

but thornton fell on his knees beside buck. head was against head,
and he was shaking him back and forth. those who hurried up heard him
cursing buck, and he cursed him long and fervently, and softly and
lovingly.

 steeped in tragedy and
shrouded in mystery. no one knew of the first man. the oldest tradition
stopped before it got back to him. from the beginning there had been an
ancient and ramshackle cabin. dying men had sworn to it, and to the mine
the site of which it marked, clinching their testimony with nuggets that
were unlike any known grade of gold in the northland.

but no living man had looted this treasure house, and the dead were
dead; wherefore john thornton and pete and hans, with buck and half a
dozen other dogs, faced into the east on an unknown trail to achieve
where men and dogs as good as themselves had failed. they sledded
seventy miles up the yukon, swung to the left into the stewart river,
passed the mayo and the mcquestion, and held on until the stewart itself
became a streamlet, threading the upstanding peaks which marked the
backbone of the continent.

john thornton asked little of man or nature. he was unafraid of the
wild. with a handful of salt and a rifle he could plun

on the time-graven wreckage of a hunting lodge, and
amid the shreds of rotted blankets john thornton found a long-barrelled
flint-lock. he knew it for a hudson bay company gun of the young days
in the northwest, when such a gun was worth its height in beaver skins
packed flat, and that was all--no hint as to the man who in an early day
had reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets.

spring came on once more, and at the end of all their wandering they
found, not the lost cabin, but a shallow placer in a broad valley where
the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the washing-pan.
they sought no farther. each day they worked earned them thousands of
dollars in clean dust and nuggets, and they worked every day. the gold
was sacked in moose-hide bags, fifty pounds to the bag, and piled
like so much firewood outside the spruce-bough lodge. like giants they
toiled, days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as they heaped

usky dog. and he knew it, in the old familiar
way, as a sound heard before. he sprang through the sleeping camp and in
swift silence dashed through the woods. as he drew closer to the cry
he went more slowly, with caution in every movement, till he came to an
open place among the trees, and looking out saw, erect on haunches, with
nose pointed to the sky, a long, lean, timber wolf.

he had made no noise, yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense
his presence. buck stalked into the open, half crouching, body gathered
compactly together, tail straight and stiff, feet falling with unwonted
care. every movement advertised commingled threatening and overture of
friendliness. it was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild
beasts that prey. but the wolf fled at sight of him. he followed, with
wild leapings, in a frenzy to overtake. he ran him into a blind channel,
in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way. the wolf
whirled about, pivoting on his hind legs after

, and the chase was resumed. time
and again he was cornered, and the thing repeated, though he was in poor
condition, or buck could not so easily have overtaken him. he would run
till buck’s head was even with his flank, when he would whirl around at
bay, only to dash away again at the first opportunity.

but in the end buck’s pertinacity was rewarded; for the wolf, finding
that no harm was intended, finally sniffed noses with him. then they
became friendly, and played about in the nervous, half-coy way with
which fierce beasts belie their fierceness. after some time of this the
wolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was
going somewhere. he made it clear to buck that he was to come, and they
ran side by side through the sombre twilight, straight up the creek bed,
into the gorge from which it issued, and across the bleak divide where
it took its rise.

on the opposite slope of the watershed they came down into a level
country where were great stretches of f

e younger bulls would
charge back upon buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd.

there is a patience of the wild--dogged, tireless, persistent as life
itself--that holds motionless for endless hours the spider in its web,
the snake in its coils, the panther in its ambuscade; this patience
belongs peculiarly to life when it hunts its living food; and it
belonged to buck as he clung to the flank of the herd, retarding
its march, irritating the young bulls, worrying the cows with their
half-grown calves, and driving the wounded bull mad with helpless rage.
for half a day this continued. buck multiplied himself, attacking from
all sides, enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of menace, cutting out his
victim as fast as it could rejoin its mates, wearing out the patience of
creatures preyed upon, which is a lesser patience than that of creatures
preying.

threatened. the life of only
one member was demanded, which was a remoter interest than their lives,
and in the end they were content to pay the toll.

as twilight fell the old bull stood with lowered head, watching his
mates--the cows he had known, the calves he had fathered, the bulls he
had mastered--as they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading
light. he could not follow, for before his nose leaped the merciless
fanged terror that would not let him go. three hundredweight more than
half a ton he weighed; he had lived a long, strong life, full of fight
and struggle, and at the end he faced death at the teeth of a creature
whose head did not reach beyond his great knuckled knees.

from then on, night and day, buck never left his prey, never gave it a
moment’s rest, never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or
the shoots of young birch and willow. nor did he give the wounded bull
opportunity to slake his burning thirst in the slender trickling streams
they crossed. ofte

presenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly did
he whirl and guard from side to side. but to prevent them from getting
behind him, he was forced back, down past the pool and into the creek
bed, till he brought up against a high gravel bank. he worked along to a
right angle in the bank which the men had made in the course of mining,
and in this angle he came to bay, protected on three sides and with
nothing to do but face the front.

and so well did he face it, that at the end of half an hour the wolves
drew back discomfited. the tongues of all were out and lolling, the
white fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight. some were lying down
with heads raised and ears pricked forward; others stood on their feet,
watching him; and still others were lapping water from the pool. one
wolf, long and lean and gray, advanced cautiously, in a friendly manner,
and buck recognized the wild brother with whom he had run for a night
and a day. he was whining softly, and, as buck whined,

noses.

then an old wolf, gaunt and battle-scarred, came forward. buck writhed
his lips into the preliminary of a snarl, but sniffed noses with him,
whereupon the old wolf sat down, pointed nose at the moon, and broke
out the long wolf howl. the others sat down and howled. and now the call
came to buck in unmistakable accents. he, too, sat down and howled. this
over, he came out of his angle and the pack crowded around him, sniffing
in half-friendly, half-savage manner. the leaders lifted the yelp of the
pack and sprang away into the woods. the wolves swung in behind, yelping
in chorus. and buck ran with them, side by side with the wild brother,
yelping as he ran.

and here may well end the story of buck. the years were not many when
the yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves; for some were
seen with splashes of brown on head and muzzle, and with a rift of white
centring down the chest. but more remarkable than t
