llowed me to the door and stood there gazing
after me with reverent admiration.

our new money was not only handsomely circulating, but its language
was already glibly in use; that is to say, people had dropped
the names of the former moneys, and spoke of things as being worth
so many dollars or cents or mills or milrays now.  it was very
gratifying.  we were progressing, that was sure.

i got to know several master mechanics, but about the most interesting
fellow among them was the blacksmith, dowley.  he was a live man
and a brisk talker, and had two journeymen and three apprentices,
and was doing a raging business.  in fact, he was getting rich,
hand over fist, and was vastly respected.  marco was very proud of
having such a man for a friend.  he had taken me there ostensibly
to let me see the big establishment which bought so much of his
charcoal, but really to let me see what easy and almost familiar
terms he was on with this great man.  dowley and i fraternized
at once; i had had just

such picked men, splendid fellows, under
me in the colt arms factory.  i was bound to see more of him, so
i invited him to come out to marco’s sunday, and dine with us.
marco was appalled, and held his breath; and when the grandee
accepted, he was so grateful that he almost forgot to be astonished
at the condescension.

marco’s joy was exuberant--but only for a moment; then he grew
thoughtful, then sad; and when he heard me tell dowley i should
have dickon, the boss mason, and smug, the boss wheelwright, out
there, too, the coal-dust on his face turned to chalk, and he lost
his grip.  but i knew what was the matter with him; it was the
expense.  he saw ruin before him; he judged that his financial
days were numbered.  however, on our way to invite the others,
i said:

“you must allow me to have these friends come; and you must also
allow me to pay the costs.”

his face cleared, and he said with spirit:

“but not all of

the king had hardly missed us when we got back at nightfall.  he
had early dropped again into his dream of a grand invasion of gaul
with the whole strength of his kingdom at his back, and the afternoon
had slipped away without his ever coming to himself again.

dowley’s humiliation

well, when that cargo arrived toward sunset, saturday afternoon,
i had my hands full to keep the marcos from fainting.  they were
sure jones and i were ruined past help, and they blamed themselves
as accessories to this bankruptcy.  you see, in addition to the
dinner-materials, which called for a sufficiently round sum,
i had bought a lot of extras for the future comfort of the family:
for instance, a big lot of wheat, a delicacy as rare to the tables
of their class as was ice-

g’s reserve melted a little, though it was some little
trouble to him to adjust himself to the name of jones along at
first.  i had asked him to try to not forget that he was a farmer;
but i had also considered it prudent to ask him to let the thing
stand at that, and not elaborate it any.  because he was just the
kind of person you could depend on to spoil a little thing like
that if you didn’t warn him, his tongue was so handy, and his
spirit so willing, and his information so uncertain.

dowley was in fine feather, and i early got him started, and then
adroitly worked him around onto his own history for a text and
himself for a hero, and then it was good to sit there and hear him
hum.  self-made man, you know.  they know how to talk.  they do
deserve more credit than any other breed of men, yes, that is true;
and they are among the very first to find it out, too.  he told how
he had begun life an orphan lad without money and without friends
able to help him; how he had lived as the sl

master lived; how his day’s work was from sixteen to eighteen hours
long, and yielded him only enough black bread to keep him in a
half-fed condition; how his faithful endeavors finally attracted
the attention of a good blacksmith, who came near knocking him
dead with kindness by suddenly offering, when he was totally
unprepared, to take him as his bound apprentice for nine years
and give him board and clothes and teach him the trade--or “mystery”
 as dowley called it.  that was his first great rise, his first
gorgeous stroke of fortune; and you saw that he couldn’t yet speak
of it without a sort of eloquent wonder and delight that such a
gilded promotion should have fallen to the lot of a common human
being.  he got no new clothing during his apprenticeship, but on
his graduation day his master tricked him out in spang-new tow-linens
and made him feel unspeakably rich and fine.

“i remember me of that day!” the wheelwright sang out, with
ent

husiasm.

“and i likewise!” cried the mason.  “i would not believe they
were thine own; in faith i could not.”

“nor other!” shouted dowley, with sparkling eyes.  “i was like
to lose my character, the neighbors wending i had mayhap been
stealing.  it was a great day, a great day; one forgetteth not
days like that.”

yes, and his master was a fine man, and prosperous, and always
had a great feast of meat twice in the year, and with it white
bread, true wheaten bread; in fact, lived like a lord, so to speak.
and in time dowley succeeded to the business and married the daughter.

“and now consider what is come to pass,” said h

here he had been blowing and
bragging about his grand meat-feast twice a year, and his fresh
meat twice a month, and his salt meat twice a week, and his white
bread every sunday the year round--all for a family of three; the
entire cost for the year not above 69.2.6 (sixty-nine cents, two
mills and six milrays), and all of a sudden here comes along a man
who slashes out nearly four dollars on a single blow-out; and not
only that, but acts as if it made him tired to handle such small
sums.  yes, dowley was a good deal wilted, and shrunk-up and
collapsed; he had the aspect of a bladder-balloon that’s been
stepped on by a cow.

sixth century political economy

however, i made a dead set at him, and before the first third
of the dinner was reached, i had him happy again.  it was easy
to do--in a country of ranks and castes.  you see, in a country
where they have ranks and castes, a man isn’t ever a man, he is
only part of a man, he can’t ever get his full growth.  you pro

in humble privacy, and the rest of us soon drifted into matters
near and dear to the hearts of our sort--business and wages,
of course.  at a first glance, things appeared to be exceeding
prosperous in this little tributary kingdom--whose lord was
king bagdemagus--as compared with the state of things in my own
region.  they had the “protection” system in full force here,
whereas we were working along down toward free-trade, by easy
stages, and were now about half way.  before long, dowley and i
were doing all the talking, the others hungrily listening.  dowley
warmed to his work, snuffed an advantage in the air, and began
to put questions which he considered pretty awkward ones for me,
and they did have something of that look:

“in your country, brother, what is the wage of a master bailiff,
master hind, carter, shepherd, swineherd?”

“twenty-five milrays a day; that is to say, a quarter of a cent.”

the smith’s face beamed with joy.  he said:

“with us they are allo

the stuffing?--an miscall not the wonderly word, this being the
first time under grace and providence of god it hath been granted
me to hear it.”

well, i was stunned; partly with this unlooked-for stupidity on
his part, and partly because his fellows so manifestly sided with
him and were of his mind--if you might call it mind.  my position
was simple enough, plain enough; how could it ever be simplified
more?  however, i must try:

“why, look here, brother dowley, don’t you see?  your wages are
merely higher than ours in _name_, not in _fact_.”

“hear him!  they are the _double_--ye have confessed it yourself.”

“yes-yes, i don’t deny that at all.  but that’s got nothing to do
with it; the _amount_ of the wages in mere coins, with meaningless
names attached to them to know them by, has got nothing to do
with it.  the thing is, how much can you _buy_ with your wages?
--that’s the idea.  while it is true that with you a good mechanic

understand it.  for instance, it takes your woman 42 days to earn
her gown, at 2 mills a day--7 weeks’ work; but ours earns hers
in forty days--two days _short_ of 7 weeks.  your woman has a gown,
and her whole seven weeks wages are gone; ours has a gown, and
two days’ wages left, to buy something else with.  there--_now_
you understand it!”

he looked--well, he merely looked dubious, it’s the most i can say;
so did the others.  i waited--to let the thing work.  dowley spoke
at last--and betrayed the fact that he actually hadn’t gotten away
from his rooted and grounded superstitions yet.  he said, with
a trifle of hesitancy:

“but--but--ye cannot fail to grant that two mills a day is better
than one.”

shucks!  well, of course, i hated to give it up.  so i chanced
another flyer:

“let us suppose a case.  suppose one of your journeymen goes out
and buys the following articles:

  “1 pound of salt;
   1 dozen eggs;
   1 dozen pints of beer;
   1 bushe

a love-tap; no, that isn’t my way; as long as i’m going to hit him
at all, i’m going to hit him a lifter.  and i don’t jump at him
all of a sudden, and risk making a blundering half-way business
of it; no, i get away off yonder to one side, and work up on him
gradually, so that he never suspects that i’m going to hit him
at all; and by and by, all in a flash, he’s flat on his back, and
he can’t tell for the life of him how it all happened.  that is
the way i went for brother dowley.  i started to talking lazy and
comfortable, as if i was just talking to pass the time; and the
oldest man in the world couldn’t have taken the bearings of my
starting place and guessed where i was going to fetch up:

“boys, there’s a good many curious things about law, and custom,
and usage, and all that sort of thing, when you come to look at it;
yes, and about the drift and progress of human opinion and movement,
too.  there are written laws--they perish; but there are also

l keep on rising, little by little, little by little,
as steadily as a tree grows, and at the end of three hundred and
forty years more there’ll be at least _one_ country where the
mechanic’s average wage will be _two hundred_ cents a day!”

it knocked them absolutely dumb!  not a man of them could get
his breath for upwards of two minutes.  then the coal-burner
said prayerfully:

“might i but live to see it!”

“it is the income of an earl!” said smug.

“an earl, say ye?” said dowley; “ye could say more than that and
speak no lie; there’s no earl in the realm of bagdemagus that hath
an income like to that.  income of an earl--mf! it’s the income
of an angel!”

“now, then, that is what is going to happen as regards wages.
in that remote day, that man will earn, with _one_ week’s work,
that bill of goods which it takes you upwards of _fifty_ weeks to
earn now.  some other pretty surprising things are going to happen,
too.  brother dowley, who is it that determines

“brave times, brave times, of a truth!” sneered the prosperous smith.

“oh,--and there’s another detail.  in that day, a master may hire
a man for only just one day, or one week, or one month at a time,
if he wants to.”

“what?”

“it’s true.  moreover, a magistrate won’t be able to force a man
to work for a master a whole year on a stretch whether the man
wants to or not.”

“will there be _no_ law or sense in that day?”

“both of them, dowley.  in that day a man will be his own property,
not the property of magistrate and master.  and he can leave town
whenever he wants to, if the wages don’t suit him!--and they can’t
put him in the pillory for it.”

“perdition catch such an age!” shouted dowley, in strong indignation.
“an age of dogs, an age barren of reverence for superiors and
respect for authority!  the pillory--”

“oh, wait, brother; say no good word for that institution.  i think
the pillory ought to be abolish

--or an eye knocked out, maybe both eyes?”

“it is true, god knoweth it.”

“and if he is unpopular he can depend on _dying_, right there in
the stocks, can’t he?”

“he surely can!  one may not deny it.”

“i take it none of _you_ are unpopular--by reason of pride or
insolence, or conspicuous prosperity, or any of those things that
excite envy and malice among the base scum of a village?  _you_
wouldn’t think it much of a risk to take a chance in the stocks?”

dowley winced, visibly.  i judged he was hit.  but he didn’t betray
it by any spoken word.  as for the others, they spoke out plainly,
and with strong feeling.  they said they had seen enough of the
stocks to know what a man’s chance in them was, and they would
never consent to enter them if they could compromise on a quick
death by hanging.

“well, to change the subject--for i think i’ve established my
point that the stocks ought to be abolished.  i think some of our
laws are pretty unfair.

for instance, if i do a thing which ought
to deliver me to the stocks, and you know i did it and yet keep
still and don’t report me, _you_ will get the stocks if anybody
informs on you.”

“ah, but that would serve you but right,” said dowley, “for you
_must_ inform.  so saith the law.”

the others coincided.

“well, all right, let it go, since you vote me down.  but there’s
one thing which certainly isn’t fair.  the magistrate fixes a
mechanic’s wage at one cent a day, for instance.  the law says that
if any master shall venture, even under utmost press of business,
to pay anything _over_ that cent a day, even for a single day, he
shall be both fined and pilloried for it; and whoever knows he did
it and doesn’t inform

, they also shall be fined and pilloried.  now
it seems to me unfair, dowley, and a deadly peril to all of us,
that because you thoughtlessly confessed, a while ago, that within
a week you have paid a cent and fifteen mil--”

oh, i tell _you_ it was a smasher!  you ought to have seen them to
go to pieces, the whole gang.  i had just slipped up on poor
smiling and complacent dowley so nice and easy and softly, that
he never suspected anything was going to happen till the blow
came crashing down and knocked him all to rags.

a fine effect.  in fact, as fine as any i ever produced, with so
little time to work it up in.

but i saw in a moment that i had overdone the thing a little.
i was expecting to scare them, but i wasn’t expecting to scare
them to death.  they were mighty near it, though.  you see they
had been a whole lifetime learning to appreciate the pillory; and
