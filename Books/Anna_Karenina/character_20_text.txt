princess shtcherbatskaya interpreted itâ€”that madame stahl had not made
the acquaintance of anyone among the russians there. the russian girl
looked after madame stahl, and besides that, she was, as kitty observed,
on friendly terms with all the invalids who were seriously ill, and
there were many of them at the springs, and looked after them in the
most natural way. this russian girl was not, as kitty gathered, related
to madame stahl, nor was she a paid attendant. madame stahl called her
varenka, and other people called her "mademoiselle varenka." apart from
the interest kitty took in this girlâ€™s relations with madame stahl and
with other unknown persons, kitty, as often happened, felt an
inexplicable attraction to mademoiselle varenka, and was aware when
their eyes met that she too liked her.

of mademoiselle varenka one would not say that she had passed her first
youth, but she was, as it were, a creature without youth; she might have

fragrance, though the petals were still unwithered. moreover, she would
have been unattractive to men also from the lack of just what kitty had
too much ofâ€”of the suppressed fire of vitality, and the consciousness of
her own attractiveness.

she always seemed absorbed in work about which there could be no doubt,
and so it seemed she could not take interest in anything outside it. it
was just this contrast with her own position that was for kitty the
great attraction of mademoiselle varenka. kitty felt that in her, in her
manner of life, she would find an example of what she was now so
painfully seeking: interest in life, a dignity in lifeâ€”apart from the
worldly relations of girls with men, which so revolted kitty, and
appeared to her now as a shameful hawking about of goods in search of a
purchaser. the more attentively kitty watched her unknown friend, the
more convinced she was this girl was the perfect creature she fancied
her, and the more eagerly she wished to make her acq

it was a wet day; it had been raining all the morning, and the invalids,
with their parasols, had flocked into the arcades.

kitty was walking there with her mother and the moscow colonel, smart
and jaunty in his european coat, bought ready-made at frankfort. they
were walking on one side of the arcade, trying to avoid levin, who was
walking on the other side. varenka, in her dark dress, in a black hat
with a turn-down brim, was walking up and down the whole length of the
arcade with a blind frenchwoman, and, every time she met kitty, they
exchanged friendly glances.

"mamma, couldnâ€™t i speak to her?" said kitty, watching her unknown
friend, and noticing that she was going up to the spring, and that they
might come there together.

"oh, if you want to so much, iâ€™ll find out about her first and make her
acquaintance myself," answered her mother. "what do

you see in her out
of the way? a companion, she must be. if you like, iâ€™ll make
acquaintance with madame stahl; i used to know her _belle-soeur_," added
the princess, lifting her head haughtily.

kitty knew that the princess was offended that madame stahl had seemed
to avoid making her acquaintance. kitty did not insist.

"how wonderfully sweet she is!" she said, gazing at varenka just as she
handed a glass to the frenchwoman. "look how natural and sweet it all
is."

"itâ€™s so funny to see your _engouements_," said the princess. "no, weâ€™d
better go back," she added, noticing levin coming towards them with his
companion and a german doctor, to whom he was talking very noisily and
angrily.

they turned to go back, when suddenly they heard, not noisy talk, but
shouting. levin, stopping short, was shouting at the doctor, and the
doctor, too, was excited. a crowd gathered

graceful!" answered the colonel. "the one thing to be
dreaded is meeting russians abroad. that tall gentleman was abusing the
doctor, flinging all sorts of insults at him because he wasnâ€™t treating
him quite as he liked, and he began waving his stick at him. itâ€™s simply
a scandal!"

"oh, how unpleasant!" said the princess. "well, and how did it end?"

"luckily at that point that ... the one in the mushroom hat ...
intervened. a russian lady, i think she is," said the colonel.

"mademoiselle varenka?" asked kitty.

"yes, yes. she came to the rescue before anyone; she took the man by the
arm and led him away."

"there, mamma," said kitty; "you wonder that iâ€™m enthusiastic about
her."

the next day, as she watched her unknown friend, kitty noticed that
mademoiselle varenka was already on the same terms with levin and his
companion as with her other _protÃ©gÃ©s_. she went up to them, entered
into conversation with them, and served as interpreter for the woman,
who could not speak any foreig

n language.

kitty began to entreat her mother still more urgently to let her make
friends with varenka. and, disagreeable as it was to the princess to
seem to take the first step in wishing to make the acquaintance of
madame stahl, who thought fit to give herself airs, she made inquiries
about varenka, and, having ascertained particulars about her tending to
prove that there could be no harm though little good in the
acquaintance, she herself approached varenka and made acquaintance with
her.

choosing a time when her daughter had gone to the spring, while varenka
had stopped outside the bakerâ€™s, the princess went up to her.

"allow me to make your acquaintance," she said, with her dignified
smile. "my daughter has lost her heart to you," she said. "possibly you
do not know me. i am..."

"that feeling is more than reciprocal, princess," varenka answered
hurriedly.

"what a good deed you did yesterday to our poor compatriot!" said the
princess.

"why, you saved that levin from disagreeable consequences."

"yes, _sa compagne_ called me, and i tried to pacify him, heâ€™s very ill,
and was dissatisfied with the doctor. iâ€™m used to looking after such
invalids."

"yes, iâ€™ve heard you live at mentone with your auntâ€”i thinkâ€”madame
stahl: i used to know her _belle-soeur_."

"no, sheâ€™s not my aunt. i call her mamma, but i am not related to her; i
was brought up by her," answered varenka, flushing a little again.

this was so simply said, and so sweet was the truthful and candid
expression of her face, that the princess saw why kitty had taken such a
fancy to varenka.

"well, and whatâ€™s this levin going to do?" asked the princess.

"heâ€™s going away," answered varenka.

at that instant kitty came up from the spring beaming with delight that
her mother had become acquainted with her unknown friend.

"well, see, kitty, your intense desire to make friends with
mademoiselle. . .

"

"varenka," varenka put in smiling, "thatâ€™s what everyone calls me."

kitty blushed with pleasure, and slowly, without speaking, pressed her
new friendâ€™s hand, which did not respond to her pressure, but lay
motionless in her hand. the hand did not respond to her pressure, but
the face of mademoiselle varenka glowed with a soft, glad, though rather
mournful smile, that showed large but handsome teeth.

"i have long wished for this too," she said.

"but you are so busy."

"oh, no, iâ€™m not at all busy," answered varenka, but at that moment she
had to leave her new friends because two little russian girls, children
of an invalid, ran up to her.

"varenka, mammaâ€™s calling!" they cried.

and varenka went after them.

the particulars which the princess had learned in regard to varenkaâ€

as he who had made her wretched
by his immoral behavior, had always been a woman of weak health and
enthusiastic temperament. when, after her separation from her husband,
she gave birth to her only child, the child had died almost immediately,
and the family of madame stahl, knowing her sensibility, and fearing the
news would kill her, had substituted another child, a baby born the same
night and in the same house in petersburg, the daughter of the chief
cook of the imperial household. this was varenka. madame stahl learned
later on that varenka was not her own child, but she went on bringing
her up, especially as very soon afterwards varenka had not a relation of
her own living. madame stahl had now been living more than ten years
continuously abroad, in the south, never leaving her couch. and some
people said that madame stahl had made her social position as a
philanthropic, highly religious woman; other people said she really was
at heart the highly ethical being, living for nothing but th

e good of
her fellow creatures, which she represented herself to be. no one knew
what her faith wasâ€”catholic, protestant, or orthodox. but one fact was
indubitableâ€”she was in amicable relations with the highest dignitaries
of all the churches and sects.

varenka lived with her all the while abroad, and everyone who knew
madame stahl knew and liked mademoiselle varenka, as everyone called
her.

having learned all these facts, the princess found nothing to object to
in her daughterâ€™s intimacy with varenka, more especially as varenkaâ€™s
breeding and education were of the bestâ€”she spoke french and english
extremely wellâ€”and what was of the most weight, brought a message from
madame stahl expressing her regret that she was prevented by her ill
health from making the acquaintance of the princess.

after getting to know varenka, kitty became more and more fa

scinated by
her friend, and every day she discovered new virtues in her.

the princess, hearing that varenka had a good voice, asked her to come
and sing to them in the evening.

"kitty plays, and we have a piano; not a good one, itâ€™s true, but you
will give us so much pleasure," said the princess with her affected
smile, which kitty disliked particularly just then, because she noticed
that varenka had no inclination to sing. varenka came, however, in the
evening and brought a roll of music with her. the princess had invited
marya yevgenyevna and her daughter and the colonel.

varenka seemed quite unaffected by there being persons present she did
not know, and she went directly to the piano. she could not accompany
herself, but she could sing music at sight very well. kitty, who played
well, accompanied her.

"you have an extraordinary talent," the princess said to her after
varenka had sung the first song extremely well.

marya yevgenyevna and her daughter expressed their thanks and
admiration.

"look," said the colonel, looking out of the window, "what an audience
has collected to listen to you." there actually was quite a considerable
crowd under the windows.

"i am very glad it gives you pleasure," varenka answered simply.

kitty looked with pride at her friend. she was enchanted by her talent,
and her voice, and her face, but most of all by her manner, by the way
varenka obviously thought nothing of her singing and was quite unmoved
by their praises. she seemed only to be asking: "am i to sing again, or
is that enough?"

"if it had been i," thought kitty, "how proud i should have been! how
delighted i should have been to see that crowd under the windows! but
sheâ€™s utterly unmoved by it. her only motive is to avoid refusing and to
please mamma. what is there in her? what is it gives her the power to
look down on everything, to be calm independently of everythi

ng? how i
should like to know it and to learn it of her!" thought kitty, gazing
into her serene face. the princess asked varenka to sing again, and
varenka sang another song, also smoothly, distinctly, and well, standing
erect at the piano and beating time on it with her thin, dark-skinned
hand.

the next song in the book was an italian one. kitty played the opening
bars, and looked round at varenka.

"letâ€™s skip that," said varenka, flushing a little. kitty let her eyes
rest on varenkaâ€™s face, with a look of dismay and inquiry.

"very well, the next one," she said hurriedly, turning over the pages,
and at once feeling that there was something connected with the song.

"no," answered varenka with a smile, laying her hand on the music, "no,
letâ€™s have that one." and she sang it just as quietly, as coolly, and as
well as the others.

when she had finished, they all thanked her again, and went off to tea.
kitty and varenka went out into the little garden that adjoined the

se.

"am i right, that you have some reminiscences connected with that song?"
said kitty. "donâ€™t tell me," she added hastily, "only say if iâ€™m right."

"no, why not? iâ€™ll tell you simply," said varenka, and, without waiting
for a reply, she went on: "yes, it brings up memories, once painful
ones. i cared for someone once, and i used to sing him that song."

kitty with big, wide-open eyes gazed silently, sympathetically at
varenka.

"i cared for him, and he cared for me; but his mother did not wish it,
and he married another girl. heâ€™s living now not far from us, and i see
him sometimes. you didnâ€™t think i had a love story too," she said, and
there was a faint gleam in her handsome face of that fire which kitty
felt must once have glowed all over her.

"i didnâ€™t think so? why, if i were a man, i could never care for anyone
else after knowing you. only i canâ€™t understand how he could, to please
his mother, forget

you and make you unhappy; he had no heart."

"oh, no, heâ€™s a very good man, and iâ€™m not unhappy; quite the contrary,
iâ€™m very happy. well, so we shanâ€™t be singing any more now," she added,
turning towards the house.

"how good you are! how good you are!" cried kitty, and stopping her, she
kissed her. "if i could only be even a little like you!"

"why should you be like anyone? youâ€™re nice as you are," said varenka,
smiling her gentle, weary smile.

"no, iâ€™m not nice at all. come, tell me.... stop a minute, letâ€™s sit
down," said kitty, making her sit down again beside her. "tell me, isnâ€™t
it humiliating to think that a man has disdained your love, that he
hasnâ€™t cared for it?..."

"but he didnâ€™t disdain it; i believe he cared for me, but he was a
dutiful son..."

"yes, but if it hadnâ€™t been on account of his mother, if it had been his
own doing?..." said kitty, feeling she was giving away her

secret, and
that her face, burning with the flush of shame, had betrayed her
already.

"in that case he would have done wrong, and i should not have regretted
him," answered varenka, evidently realizing that they were now talking
not of her, but of kitty.

"but the humiliation," said kitty, "the humiliation one can never
forget, can never forget," she said, remembering her look at the last
ball during the pause in the music.

"where is the humiliation? why, you did nothing wrong?"

"worse than wrongâ€”shameful."

varenka shook her head and laid her hand on kittyâ€™s hand.

"why, what is there shameful?" she said. "you didnâ€™t tell a man, who
didnâ€™t care for you, that yo

u loved him, did you?"

"of course not; i never said a word, but he knew it. no, no, there are
looks, there are ways; i canâ€™t forget it, if i live a hundred years."

"why so? i donâ€™t understand. the whole point is whether you love him now
or not," said varenka, who called everything by its name.

"i hate him; i canâ€™t forgive myself."

"why, what for?"

"the shame, the humiliation!"

"oh! if everyone were as sensitive as you are!" said varenka. "there
isnâ€™t a girl who hasnâ€™t been through the same. and itâ€™s all so
unimportant."

"why, what is important?" said kitty, looking into her face with
inquisitive wonder.

"oh, thereâ€™s so much thatâ€™s important," said varenka, smiling.

"why, what?"

"oh, so much thatâ€™s more important," answered varenka, not knowing what
to say. but at that instant they heard the princessâ€™s voice from the
window. "kitty, itâ€™s cold! either get a shawl, or come indoors."

"it really is time to go i

n!" said varenka, getting up. "i have to go on
to madame bertheâ€™s; she asked me to."

kitty held her by the hand, and with passionate curiosity and entreaty
her eyes asked her: "what is it, what is this of such importance that
gives you such tranquillity? you know, tell me!" but varenka did not
even know what kittyâ€™s eyes were asking her. she merely thought that she
had to go to see madame berthe too that evening, and to make haste home
in time for _mamanâ€™s_ tea at twelve oâ€™clock. she went indoors, collected
her music, and saying good-bye to everyone, was about to go.

"allow me to see you home," said the colonel.

"yes, how can you go alone at night like this?" chimed in the princess.
"anyway, iâ€™ll send parasha."

kitty saw that varenka could hardly restrain a smile a
 
 ___________________________
 
"no, i always go about alone and nothing ever happens to me," she said,
taking her hat. and kissing kitty once more, without saying what was
important, she stepped out courageously with the music under her arm and
vanished into the twilight of the summer night, bearing away with her
her secret of what was important and what gave her the calm and dignity
so much to be envied.



chapter 33


kitty made the acquaintance of madame stahl too, and this acquaintance,
together with her friendship with varenka, did not merely exercise a
great influence on her, it also comforted her in her mental distress.
she found this comfort through a completely new world being opened to
her by means of this acquaintance, a world having nothing in common with
her past, an exalted, noble world, from the height of which she could
contemplate her past calmly. it was revealed to her that besides the
instinctive life to which kitty had given herself up hitherto there was
a spiritual life. this life was disclosed in rel
 
 ___________________________
 
 stahl talked to kitty as
to a charming child that one looks on with pleasure as on the memory of
oneâ€™s youth, and only once she said in passing that in all human sorrows
nothing gives comfort but love and faith, and that in the sight of
christâ€™s compassion for us no sorrow is triflingâ€”and immediately talked
of other things. but in every gesture of madame stahl, in every word, in
every heavenlyâ€”as kitty called itâ€”look, and above all in the whole story
of her life, which she heard from varenka, kitty recognized that
something "that was important," of which, till then, she had known
nothing.

yet, elevated as madame stahlâ€™s character was, touching as was her
story, and exalted and moving as was her speech, kitty could not help
detecting in her some traits which perplexed her. she noticed that when
questioning her about her family, madame stahl had smiled
contemptuously, which was not in accord with christian meekness. she
noticed, too, that when she had found a catholic priest with 
 
 ___________________________
 
her, madame
stahl had studiously kept her face in the shadow of the lamp-shade and
had smiled in a peculiar way. trivial as these two observations were,
they perplexed her, and she had her doubts as to madame stahl. but on
the other hand varenka, alone in the world, without friends or
relations, with a melancholy disappointment in the past, desiring
nothing, regretting nothing, was just that perfection of which kitty
dared hardly dream. in varenka she realized that one has but to forget
oneself and love others, and one will be calm, happy, and noble. and
that was what kitty longed to be. seeing now clearly what was _the most
important_, kitty was not satisfied with being enthusiastic over it; she
at once gave herself up with her whole soul to the new life that was
opening to her. from varenkaâ€™s accounts of the doings of madame stahl
and other people whom she mentioned, kitty had already constructed the
plan of her own future life. she 
 
 ___________________________
 
would, like madame stahlâ€™s niece,
aline, of whom varenka had talked to her a great deal, seek out those
who were in trouble, wherever she might be living, help them as far as
she could, give them the gospel, read the gospel to the sick, to
criminals, to the dying. the idea of reading the gospel to criminals, as
aline did, particularly fascinated kitty. but all these were secret
dreams, of which kitty did not talk either to her mother or to varenka.

while awaiting the time for carrying out her plans on a large scale,
however, kitty, even then at the springs, where there were so many
people ill and unhappy, readily found a chance for practicing her new
principles in imitation of varenka.

at first the princess noticed nothing but that kitty was much under the
influence of her _engouement_, as she called it, for madame stahl, and
still more for varenka. she saw that kitty did not merely imitate
varenka in her conduct, but unconsciously imi
 
 ___________________________
 
tated her in her manner of
walking, of talking, of blinking her eyes. but later on the princess
noticed that, apart from this adoration, some kind of serious spiritual
change was taking place in her daughter.

the princess saw that in the evenings kitty read a french testament that
madame stahl had given herâ€”a thing she had never done before; that she
avoided society acquaintances and associated with the sick people who
were under varenkaâ€™s protection, and especially one poor family, that of
a sick painter, petrov. kitty was unmistakably proud of playing the part
of a sister of mercy in that family. all this was well enough, and the
princess had nothing to say against it, especially as petrovâ€™s wife was
a perfectly nice sort of woman, and that the german princess, noticing
kittyâ€™s devotion, praised her, calling her an angel of consolation. all
this would have been very well, if there had been no exaggeration. but

 it anna pavlovnaâ€™s not been to see us for so long?" the princess
said one day of madame petrova. "iâ€™ve asked her, but she seems put out
about something."

"no, iâ€™ve not noticed it, maman," said kitty, flushing hotly.

"is it long since you went to see them?"

"weâ€™re meaning to make an expedition to the mountains tomorrow,"
answered kitty.

"well, you can go," answered the princess, gazing at her daughterâ€™s
embarrassed face and trying to guess the cause of her embarrassment.

that day varenka came to dinner and told them that anna pavlovna had
changed her mind and given up the expedition for the morrow. and the
princess noticed again that kitty reddened.

"kitty, havenâ€™t you had some misunderstanding with the petrovs?" said
the princess, when they were left alone. "why has she given up sending
the children and coming to see us?"

kitty answered that nothing had happened between them, and that she
could not tell why anna pavlovna seemed displeased with her. kitty

affected, which did not altogether suit her. the prince, on the
contrary, thought everything foreign detestable, got sick of european
life, kept to his russian habits, and purposely tried to show himself
abroad less european than he was in reality.

the prince returned thinner, with the skin hanging in loose bags on his
cheeks, but in the most cheerful frame of mind. his good humor was even
greater when he saw kitty completely recovered. the news of kittyâ€™s
friendship with madame stahl and varenka, and the reports the princess
gave him of some kind of change she had noticed in kitty, troubled the
prince and aroused his habitual feeling of jealousy of everything that
drew his daughter away from him, and a dread that his daughter might
have got out of the reach of his influence into regions inaccessible to
him. but these unpleasant matters were all drowned in the sea of
kindliness and good humor which was always within him, and more so than
ever since his course of carlsbad waters.

nce of the garden they met
the blind lady, madame berthe, with her guide, and the prince was
delighted to see the old frenchwomanâ€™s face light up when she heard
kittyâ€™s voice. she at once began talking to him with french exaggerated
politeness, applauding him for having such a delightful daughter,
extolling kitty to the skies before her face, and calling her a
treasure, a pearl, and a consoling angel.

"well, sheâ€™s the second angel, then," said the prince, smiling. "she
calls mademoiselle varenka angel number one."

"oh! mademoiselle varenka, sheâ€™s a real angel, allez," madame berthe
assented.

in the arcade they met varenka herself. she was walking rapidly towards
them carrying an elegant red bag.

"here is papa come," kitty said to her.

varenka madeâ€”simply and naturally as she did everythingâ€”a movement
between a bow and a curtsey, and immediately began talking to the
prince, without shyness, naturally, as she talked to everyone.

"of course i know you; i know you very well," th

e prince said to her
with a smile, in which kitty detected with joy that her father liked her
friend. "where are you off to in such haste?"

"mamanâ€™s here," she said, turning to kitty. "she has not slept all
night, and the doctor advised her to go out. iâ€™m taking her her work."

"so thatâ€™s angel number one?" said the prince when varenka had gone on.

kitty saw that her father had meant to make fun of varenka, but that he
could not do it because he liked her.

"come, so we shall see all your friends," he went on, "even madame
stahl, if she deigns to recognize me."

"why, did you know her, papa?" kitty asked apprehensively, catching the
gleam of irony that kindled in the princeâ€™s eyes at the mention of
madame stahl.

"i used to know her husband, and her too a little, before sheâ€™d joined
the pietists."

"what is a pietist, papa?" asked kitty, dismayed to find that what she
prized so highly in mada

then," said kitty, turning round resolutely. "how are
you feeling today?" she asked petrov.

petrov got up, leaning on his stick, and looked shyly at the prince.

"this is my daughter," said the prince. "let me introduce myself."

the painter bowed and smiled, showing his strangely dazzling white
teeth.

"we expected you yesterday, princess," he said to kitty. he staggered as
he said this, and then repeated the motion, trying to make it seem as if
it had been intentional.

"i meant to come, but varenka said that anna pavlovna sent word you were
not going."

"not going!" said petrov, blushing, and immediately beginning to cough,
and his eyes sought his wife. "anita! anita!" he said loudly, and the
swollen veins stood out like cords on his thin white neck.

anna pavlovna came up.

"so you sent word to the princess that we werenâ€™t going!" he whispered
to her angrily, losing his voice.

"good morning, princess," said anna pavlovna, with an assumed smile
utterly unlike her former manner. "very g

"delighted! i have taken a great fancy to your daughter."

"you are still in weak health?"

"yes; iâ€™m used to it," said madame stahl, and she introduced the prince
to the swedish count.

"you are scarcely changed at all," the prince said to her. "itâ€™s ten or
eleven years since i had the honor of seeing you."

"yes; god sends the cross and sends the strength to bear it. often one
wonders what is the goal of this life?... the other side!" she said
angrily to varenka, who had rearranged the rug over her feet not to her
satisfaction.

"to do good, probably," said the prince with a twinkle in his eye.

"that is not for us to judge," said madame stahl, perceiving the shade
of expression on the princeâ€™s face. "so you will send me that book, dear
count? iâ€™m very grateful to you," she said to the young swede.

"ah!" cried the prince, catching sight of the moscow colonel standing
near, and with a bow to madame stahl he walked away with his daughter

acquaintance.

"sheâ€™s just the same," replied the prince.

"did you know her before her illness, princeâ€”thatâ€™s to say before she
took to her bed?"

"yes. she took to her bed before my eyes," said the prince.

"they say itâ€™s ten years since she has stood on her feet."

"she doesnâ€™t stand up because her legs are too short. sheâ€™s a very bad
figure."

"papa, itâ€™s not possible!" cried kitty.

"thatâ€™s what wicked tongues say, my darling. and your varenka catches it
too," he added. "oh, these invalid ladies!"

"oh, no, papa!" kitty objected warmly. "varenka worships her. and then
she does so much good! ask anyone! everyone knows her and aline stahl."

"perhaps so," said the prince, squeezing her hand with his elbow; "but
itâ€™s better when one does good so that you may ask everyone and no one
knows."

kitty did not answer, not because she had nothing to say, but because
she did not care to reveal her secret thoughts even to her father. but,

he had so made up her mind not to be
influenced by her fatherâ€™s views, not to let him into her inmost
sanctuary, she felt that the heavenly image of madame stahl, which she
had carried for a whole month in her heart, had vanished, never to
return, just as the fantastic figure made up of some clothes thrown down
at random vanishes when one sees that it is only some garment lying
there. all that was left was a woman with short legs, who lay down
because she had a bad figure, and worried patient varenka for not
arranging her rug to her liking. and by no effort of the imagination
could kitty bring back the former madame stahl.

the prince communicated his good humor to his own family and his
friends, and even to the german landlord in whose rooms the
shtcherbatskys were staying.

on coming back with kitty from the springs, the prince, who had asked
the colonel, and marya yevgenyevna, and varenka all to come and have
coffee with them, gave orders for a table and chairs to be taken

 cookery, especially his plum soup. the princess
laughed at her husband for his russian ways, but she was more lively and
good-humored than she had been all the while she had been at the waters.
the colonel smiled, as he always did, at the princeâ€™s jokes, but as far
as regards europe, of which he believed himself to be making a careful
study, he took the princessâ€™s side. the simple-hearted marya yevgenyevna
simply roared with laughter at everything absurd the prince said, and
his jokes made varenka helpless with feeble but infectious laughter,
which was something kitty had never seen before.

kitty was glad of all this, but she could not be light-hearted. she
could not solve the problem her father had unconsciously set her by his
goodhumored view of her friends, and of the life that had so attracted
her. to this doubt there was joined the change in her relations with the
petrovs, which had been so conspicuously and unpleasantly marked that
morning. everyone was good humored, but kitty cou

round again. youâ€™ve time to think things over, and no hurry."

"but timeâ€™s money, you forget that," said the colonel.

"time, indeed, that depends! why, thereâ€™s time one would give a month of
for sixpence, and time you wouldnâ€™t give half an hour of for any money.
isnâ€™t that so, katinka? what is it? why are you so depressed?"

"iâ€™m not depressed."

"where are you off to? stay a little longer," he said to varenka.

"i must be going home," said varenka, getting up, and again she went off
into a giggle. when she had recovered, she said good-bye, and went into
the house to get her hat.

kitty followed her. even varenka struck her as different. she was not
worse, but different from what she had fancied her before.

"oh, dear! itâ€™s a long while since iâ€™ve laughed so much!" said varenka,
gathering up her parasol and her bag. "how nice he is, your father!"

kitty did not speak.

"when shall i see you again

?" asked varenka.

"mamma meant to go and see the petrovs. wonâ€™t you be there?" said kitty,
to try varenka.

"yes," answered varenka. "theyâ€™re getting ready to go away, so i
promised to help them pack."

"well, iâ€™ll come too, then."

"no, why should you?"

"why not? why not? why not?" said kitty, opening her eyes wide, and
clutching at varenkaâ€™s parasol, so as not to let her go. "no, wait a
minute; why not?"

"oh, nothing; your father has come, and besides, they will feel awkward
at your helping."

"no, tell me why you donâ€™t want me to be often at the petrovsâ€™. you
donâ€™t want me toâ€”why not?"

"i didnâ€™t say that," said varenka quietly.

"no, please tell me!"

"tell you everything?" asked varenka.

"everything, everything!" kitty assented.

"well, thereâ€™s really nothing of any consequence; only that mihail
alexeyevitch" (
 
 ___________________________
 
that was the artistâ€™s name) "had meant to leave earlier,
and now he doesnâ€™t want to go away," said varenka, smiling.

"well, well!" kitty urged impatiently, looking darkly at varenka.

"well, and for some reason anna pavlovna told him that he didnâ€™t want to
go because you are here. of course, that was nonsense; but there was a
dispute over itâ€”over you. you know how irritable these sick people are."

kitty, scowling more than ever, kept silent, and varenka went on
speaking alone, trying to soften or soothe her, and seeing a storm
comingâ€”she did not know whether of tears or of words.

"so youâ€™d better not go.... you understand; you wonâ€™t be offended?..."

"and it serves me right! and it serves me right!" kitty cried quickly,
snatching the parasol out of varenkaâ€™s hand, and looking past her
friendâ€™s face.

varenka felt inclined to smile, looking at her childish fury, but she
was afraid of wounding her.

"how does it serve you right? i don
 
 ___________________________
 
â€™t understand," she said.

"it serves me right, because it was all sham; because it was all done on
purpose, and not from the heart. what business had i to interfere with
outsiders? and so itâ€™s come about that iâ€™m a cause of quarrel, and that
iâ€™ve done what nobody asked me to do. because it was all a sham! a sham!
a sham!..."

"a sham! with what object?" said varenka gently.

"oh, itâ€™s so idiotic! so hateful! there was no need whatever for me....
nothing but sham!" she said, opening and shutting the parasol.

"but with what object?"

"to seem better to people, to myself, to god; to deceive everyone. no!
now i wonâ€™t descend to that. iâ€™ll be bad; but anyway not a liar, a
cheat."

"but who is a cheat?" said varenka reproachfully. "you speak as if..."

but kitty was in one of her gusts of fury, and she would not let her
finish.

"i donâ€™t talk about you,
 
 ___________________________
 
 not about you at all. youâ€™re perfection. yes,
yes, i know youâ€™re all perfection; but what am i to do if iâ€™m bad? this
would never have been if i werenâ€™t bad. so let me be what i am. i wonâ€™t
be a sham. what have i to do with anna pavlovna? let them go their way,
and me go mine. i canâ€™t be different.... and yet itâ€™s not that, itâ€™s not
that."

"what is not that?" asked varenka in bewilderment.

"everything. i canâ€™t act except from the heart, and you act from
principle. i liked you simply, but you most likely only wanted to save
me, to improve me."

"you are unjust," said varenka.

"but iâ€™m not speaking of other people, iâ€™m speaking of myself."

"kitty," they heard her motherâ€™s voice, "come here, show papa your
necklace."

kitty, with a haughty air, without making peace with her friend, took
the necklace in a little box from the table and went to her mother.


 
 ___________________________
 
"whatâ€™s the matter? why are you so red?" her mother and father said to
her with one voice.

"nothing," she answered. "iâ€™ll be back directly," and she ran back.

"sheâ€™s still here," she thought. "what am i to say to her? oh, dear!
what have i done, what have i said? why was i rude to her? what am i to
do? what am i to say to her?" thought kitty, and she stopped in the
doorway.

varenka in her hat and with the parasol in her hands was sitting at the
table examining the spring which kitty had broken. she lifted her head.

"varenka, forgive me, do forgive me," whispered kitty, going up to her.
"i donâ€™t remember what i said. i..."

"i really didnâ€™t mean to hurt you," said varenka, smiling.

peace was made. but with her fatherâ€™s coming all the world in which she
had been living was transformed for kitty. she did not give up
everything she had learned, but she became aware th

ty of maintaining herself
without hypocrisy and self-conceit on the pinnacle to which she had
wished to mount. moreover, she became aware of all the dreariness of the
world of sorrow, of sick and dying people, in which she had been living.
the efforts she had made to like it seemed to her intolerable, and she
felt a longing to get back quickly into the fresh air, to russia, to
ergushovo, where, as she knew from letters, her sister dolly had already
gone with her children.

but her affection for varenka did not wane. as she said good-bye, kitty
begged her to come to them in russia.

"iâ€™ll come when you get married," said varenka.

"i shall never marry."

"well, then, i shall never come."

"well, then, i shall be married simply for that. mind now, remember your
promise," said kitty.

the doctorâ€™s prediction was fulfilled. kitty returned home to russia
cured. she was not so gay and thoughtless as before, but she was serene.
her moscow troubles had become a memory to her.

to levinâ€™s mind what he had to say on the subject. but these
ideas, once of such importance in his eyes, seemed to come into his
brain as in a dream, and had now not the slightest interest for him. it
even struck him as strange that they should be so eager to talk of what
was of no use to anyone. kitty, too, should, one would have supposed,
have been interested in what they were saying of the rights and
education of women. how often she had mused on the subject, thinking of
her friend abroad, varenka, of her painful state of dependence, how
often she had wondered about herself what would become of her if she did
not marry, and how often she had argued with her sister about it! but it
did not interest her at all. she and levin had a conversation of their
own, yet not a conversation, but some sort of mysterious communication,
which brought them every moment nearer, and stirred in both a sense of
glad terror before the unknown into which they were entering.

he was very sorry his official duties prevented him from spending the
summer in the country with his family, which would have been the
greatest happiness for him; and remaining in moscow, he came down to the
country from time to time for a day or two. besides the oblonskys, with
all their children and their governess, the old princess too came to
stay that summer with the levins, as she considered it her duty to watch
over her inexperienced daughter in her _interesting condition_.
moreover, varenka, kittyâ€™s friend abroad, kept her promise to come to
kitty when she was married, and stayed with her friend. all of these
were friends or relations of levinâ€™s wife. and though he liked them all,
he rather regretted his own levin world and ways, which was smothered by
this influx of the "shtcherbatsky element," as he called it to himself.
of his own relations there stayed with him only sergey ivanovitch, but
he too was a man of the koznishev and not the levin stamp, so that the

that almost all the rooms were occupied, and almost every day it
happened that the old princess, sitting down to table, counted them all
over, and put the thirteenth grandson or granddaughter at a separate
table. and kitty, with her careful housekeeping, had no little trouble
to get all the chickens, turkeys, and geese, of which so many were
needed to satisfy the summer appetites of the visitors and children.

the whole family were sitting at dinner. dollyâ€™s children, with their
governess and varenka, were making plans for going to look for
mushrooms. sergey ivanovitch, who was looked up to by all the party for
his intellect and learning, with a respect that almost amounted to awe,
surprised everyone by joining in the conversation about mushrooms.

"take me with you. i am very fond of picking mushrooms," he said,
looking at varenka; "i think itâ€™s a very nice occupation."

"oh, we shall be delighted," answered varenka, coloring a little. kitty
exchanged meaningful glances with dolly. the p

roposal of the learned and
intellectual sergey ivanovitch to go looking for mushrooms with varenka
confirmed certain theories of kittyâ€™s with which her mind had been very
busy of late. she made haste to address some remark to her mother, so
that her look should not be noticed. after dinner sergey ivanovitch sat
with his cup of coffee at the drawing-room window, and while he took
part in a conversation he had begun with his brother, he watched the
door through which the children would start on the mushroom-picking
expedition. levin was sitting in the window near his brother.

kitty stood be

king significantly at her.

"oh, and thereâ€™s no time either," added sergey ivanovitch, seeing the
children running out.

at the head of them all tanya galloped sideways, in her tightly-drawn
stockings, and waving a basket and sergey ivanovitchâ€™s hat, she ran
straight up to him.

boldly running up to sergey ivanovitch with shining eyes, so like her
fatherâ€™s fine eyes, she handed him his hat and made as though she would
put it on for him, softening her freedom by a shy and friendly smile.

"varenkaâ€™s waiting," she said, carefully putting his hat on, seeing from
sergey ivanovitchâ€™s smile that she might do so.

varenka was standing at the door, dressed in a yellow print gown, with a
white kerchief on her head.

"iâ€™m coming, iâ€™m coming, varvara andreevna," said sergey ivanovitch,
finishing his cup of coffee, and putting into their separate pockets his
handkerchief and cigar-case.

"and how sweet my varenka is! eh?" said kitty to her husband, as soon as
sergey ivanovitch rose. she spo

ke so that sergey ivanovitch could hear,
and it was clear that she meant him to do so. "and how good-looking she
isâ€”such a refined beauty! varenka!" kitty shouted. "shall you be in the
mill copse? weâ€™ll come out to you."

"you certainly forget your condition, kitty," said the old princess,
hurriedly coming out at the door. "you mustnâ€™t shout like that."

varenka, hearing kittyâ€™s voice and her motherâ€™s reprimand, went with
light, rapid steps up to kitty. the rapidity of her movement, her
flushed and eager face, everything betrayed that something out of the
common was going on in her. kitty knew what this was, and had been
watching her intently. she called varenka at that moment merely in order
mentally to give her a blessing for the important event which, as kitty
fancied, was bound to come to pass that day after dinner in the wood.

"varenka, i sho

uld be very happy if a certain something were to happen,"
she whispered as she kissed her.

"and are you coming with us?" varenka said to levin in confusion,
pretending not to have heard what had been said.

"i am coming, but only as far as the threshing-floor, and there i shall
stop."

"why, what do you want there?" said kitty.

"i must go to have a look at the new wagons, and to check the invoice,"
said levin; "and where will you be?"

"on the terrace."

on the terrace were assembled all the ladies of the party. they always
liked sitting there after dinner, and that day they had work to do there
too. besid

 the
weighty subject under discussion, what presents should be made to
servants. "but..."

"moneyâ€™s out of the question!" the princess and kitty exclaimed with one
voice. "they appreciate a present..."

"well, last year, for instance, i bought our matrona semyenovna, not a
poplin, but something of that sort," said the princess.

"i remember she was wearing it on your nameday."

"a charming patternâ€”so simple and refined,â€”i should have liked it
myself, if she hadnâ€™t had it. something like varenkaâ€™s. so pretty and
inexpensive."

"well, now i think itâ€™s done," said dolly, dropping the syrup from the
spoon.

"when it sets as it drops, itâ€™s ready. cook it a little longer, agafea
mihalovna."

"the flies!" said agafea mihalovna angrily. "itâ€™ll be just the same,"
she added.

"ah! how sweet it is! donâ€™t frighten it!" kitty said suddenly, looking
at a sparrow that had settled on the step and was pecking at the center
of a raspberry.

"yes, but you keep a little further from the stove,"

 said her mother.

"_Ã  propos de varenka_," said kitty, speaking in french, as they had
been doing all the while, so that agafea mihalovna should not understand
them, "you know, mamma, i somehow expect things to be settled today. you
know what i mean. how splendid it would be!"

"but what a famous matchmaker she is!" said dolly. "how carefully and
cleverly she throws them together!..."

"no; tell me, mamma, what do you think?"

"why, what is one to think? he" (_he_ meant sergey ivanovitch) "might at
any time have been a match for anyo

es, by smiles..."

"how nicely you said that, mamma! itâ€™s just by the eyes, by smiles that
itâ€™s done," dolly assented.

"but what words did he say?"

"what did kostya say to you?"

"he wrote it in chalk. it was wonderful.... how long ago it seems!" she
said.

and the three women all fell to musing on the same thing. kitty was the
first to break the silence. she remembered all that last winter before
her marriage, and her passion for vronsky.

"thereâ€™s one thing ... that old love affair of varenkaâ€™s," she said, a
natural chain of ideas bringing her to this point. "i should have liked
to say something to sergey ivanovitch, to prepare him. theyâ€™re allâ€”all
men, i mean," she added, "awfully jealous over our past."

"not all," said dolly. "you judge by your own husband. it makes him
miserable even now to remember vronsky. eh? thatâ€™s true, isnâ€™t it?"

"yes," kitty answered, a pensive smile in her eyes.

"but i really donâ€™t know," the mother put in in defense of her motherly
care of

"that was good, but this is even better. both are better," he said,
squeezing her hand.

"do you know what we were talking about when you came in?"

"about jam?"

"oh, yes, about jam too; but afterwards, about how men make offers."

"ah!" said levin, listening more to the sound of her voice than to the
words she was saying, and all the while paying attention to the road,
which passed now through the forest, and avoiding places where she might
make a false step.

"and about sergey ivanovitch and varenka. youâ€™ve noticed?... iâ€™m very
anxious for it," she went on. "what do you think about it?" and she
peeped into his face.

"i donâ€™t know what to think," levin answered, smiling. "sergey seems
very strange to me in that way. i told you, you know..."

"yes, that he was in love with that girl who died...."

"that was when i was a child; i know about it from hearsay and
tradition. i remember him then. he was wonderfully sweet. but iâ€™ve
watched him since with women; he is friendly, some of them

one feels that to him theyâ€™re simply people, not women."

"yes, but now with varenka ... i fancy thereâ€™s something..."

"perhaps there is.... but one has to know him.... heâ€™s a peculiar,
wonderful person. he lives a spiritual life only. heâ€™s too pure, too
exalted a nature."

"why? would this lower him, then?"

"no, but heâ€™s so used to a spiritual life that he canâ€™t reconcile
himself with actual fact, and varenka is after all fact."

levin had grown used by now to uttering his thought boldly, without
taking the trouble of clothing it in exact language. he knew that his
wife, in such moments of loving tenderness as now, would understand what
he meant to say from a hint, and she did understand him.

"yes, but thereâ€™s not so much of that actual fact about her as about me.
i can see that he would never have cared for me. she is altogether
spiritual."

"oh, no, he is so fond of you, and i am always so glad

at his hand, stopped him. she had been
watching his fingers with interest. "you picked off two."

"oh, but see, this little one shanâ€™t count to make up," said levin,
tearing off a little half-grown petal. "hereâ€™s the wagonette overtaking
us."

"arenâ€™t you tired, kitty?" called the princess.

"not in the least."

"if you are you can get in, as the horses are quiet and walking."

but it was not worth while to get in, they were quite near the place,
and all walked on together.



chapter 4


varenka, with her white kerchief on her black hair, surrounded by the
children, gaily and good-humoredly looking after them, and at the same
time visibly excited at the possibility of receiving a declaration from
the man she cared for, was very attractive. sergey ivanovitch walked
beside her, and never left off admiring her. looking at her, he recalled
all the delightful things he had heard from her lips, all the good he
knew about her, and became more and more conscious that the feeling he
had for her

 were gray trunks of aspen and dark bushes of
hazel. walking some forty paces away, sergey ivanovitch, knowing he was
out of sight, stood still behind a bushy spindle-tree in full flower
with its rosy red catkins. it was perfectly still all round him. only
overhead in the birches under which he stood, the flies, like a swarm of
bees, buzzed unceasingly, and from time to time the childrenâ€™s voices
were floated across to him. all at once he heard, not far from the edge
of the wood, the sound of varenkaâ€™s contralto voice, calling grisha, and
a smile of delight passed over sergey ivanovitchâ€™s face. conscious of
this smile, he shook his head disapprovingly at his own condition, and
taking out a cigar, he began lighting it. for a long while he could not
get a match to light against the trunk of a birch tree. the soft scales
of the white bark rubbed off the phosphorus, and the light went out. at
last one of the matches burned, and the fragrant cigar smoke, hovering
uncertainly in flat, wide co

ions and their influence into her husbandâ€™s house, as he saw now in
kittyâ€™s case. she would owe everything to her husband, which was what he
had always desired too for his future family life. and this girl, who
united all these qualities, loved him. he was a modest man, but he could
not help seeing it. and he loved her. there was one consideration
against itâ€”his age. but he came of a long-lived family, he had not a
single gray hair, no one would have taken him for forty, and he
remembered varenkaâ€™s saying that it was only in russia that men of fifty
thought themselves old, and that in france a man of fifty considers
himself _dans la force de lâ€™Ã¢ge_, while a man of forty is _un jeune
homme_. but what did the mere reckoning of years matter when he felt as
young in heart as he had been twenty years ago? was it not youth to feel
as he felt now, when coming from the other side to the edge of the wood
he saw in the glowing light of the slanting sunbeams the gracious figure
of varenka in

her yellow gown with her basket, walking lightly by the
trunk of an old birch tree, and when this impression of the sight of
varenka blended so harmoniously with the beauty of the view, of the
yellow oatfield lying bathed in the slanting sunshine, and beyond it the
distant ancient forest flecked with yellow and melting into the blue of
the distance? his heart throbbed joyously. a softened feeling came over
him. he felt that he had made up his mind. varenka, who had just
crouched down to pick a mushroom, rose with a supple movement and looked
round. flinging away the cigar, sergey ivanovitch advanced with resolute
steps towards her.



chapter 5


"varvara andreevna, when i was very young, i set before myself the ideal
of the woman i loved and should be happy to call my wife. i have lived
through a long life, and now for the first time i have met what i
soughtâ€”in you. i love you, and offer you my hand."

sergey ivanovitch was saying this to hims

change her position, but everything told him that she felt his presence
and was glad of it.

"well, did you find some?" she asked from under the white kerchief,
turning her handsome, gently smiling face to him.

"not one," said sergey ivanovitch. "did you?"

she did not answer, busy with the children who thronged about her.

"that one too, near the twig," she pointed out to little masha a little
fungus, split in half across its rosy cap by the dry grass from under
which it thrust itself. varenka got up while masha picked the fungus,
breaking it into two white halves. "this brings back my childhood," she
added, moving apart from the children beside sergey ivanovitch.

they walked on for some steps in silence. varenka saw that he wanted to
speak; she guessed of what, and felt faint with joy and panic. they had
walked so far away that no one could hear them now, but still he did not
begin to speak. it would have been better for varenka to be silent.
after a silence it would have been easi

er for them to say what they
wanted to say than after talking about mushrooms. but against her own
will, as it were accidentally, varenka said:

"so you found nothing? in the middle of the wood there are always fewer,
though." sergey ivanovitch sighed and made no answer. he was annoyed
that she had spoken about the mushrooms. he wanted to bring her back to
the first words she had uttered about her childhood; but after a pause
of some length, as though against his own will, he made an observation
in response to her last words.

"i have heard that the white edible funguses are found principally at
the edge of the wood, though i can

â€™t tell them apart."

some minutes more passed, they moved still further away from the
children, and were quite alone. varenkaâ€™s heart throbbed so that she
heard it beating, and felt that she was turning red and pale and red
again.

to be the wife of a man like koznishev, after her position with madame
stahl, was to her imagination the height of happiness. besides, she was
almost certain that she was in love with him. and this moment it would
have to be decided. she felt frightened. she dreaded both his speaking
and his not speaking.

now or never it must be saidâ€”that sergey ivanovitch felt too. everything

xpression, the flushed cheeks and the downcast eyes of varenka
betrayed a painful suspense. sergey ivanovitch saw it and felt sorry for
her. he felt even that to say nothing now would be a slight to her.
rapidly in his own mind he ran over all the arguments in support of his
decision. he even said over to himself the words in which he meant to
put his offer, but instead of those words, some utterly unexpected
reflection that occurred to him made him ask:

"what is the difference between the â€˜birchâ€™ mushroom and the â€˜whiteâ€™
mushroom?"

varenkaâ€™s l

ion as she answered:

"in the top part there is scarcely any difference, itâ€™s in the stalk."

and as soon as these words were uttered, both he and she felt that it
was over, that what was to have been said would not be said; and their
emotion, which had up to then been continually growing more intense,
began to subside.

"the birch mushroomâ€™s stalk suggests a dark manâ€™s chin after two days
without shaving," said sergey ivanovitch, speaking quite calmly now.

"yes, thatâ€™s true," answered varenka smiling, and unconsciously the
direction of their walk changed. they began to turn towards the
children. varenka felt both sore and ashamed; at the same time she had a
sense of relief.

when he had got home again and went over the whole subject, sergey
ivanovitch thought his previous decision had been a mistaken one. he
could not be false to the memory of marie.

"gently, children, gently!" levin shouted quite angrily to the children,
standing before his wife to protect her when the crowd of ch

with shrieks of delight to meet them.

behind the children sergey ivanovitch and varenka walked out of the
wood. kitty had no need to ask varenka; she saw from the calm and
somewhat crestfallen faces of both that her plans had not come off.

"well?" her husband questioned her as they were going home again.

"it doesnâ€™t bite," said kitty, her smile and manner of speaking
recalling her father, a likeness levin often noticed with pleasure.

"how doesnâ€™t bite?"

"iâ€™ll show you," she said, taking her husbandâ€™s hand, lifting it to her
mouth, and just faintly brushing it with closed lips. "like a kiss on a
priestâ€™s hand."

"which didn

"both. but it should have been like this..."

"there are some peasants coming..."

"oh, they didnâ€™t see."



chapter 6


during the time of the childrenâ€™s tea the grown-up people sat in the
balcony and talked as though nothing had happened, though they all,
especially sergey ivanovitch and varenka, were very well aware that
there had happened an event which, though negative, was of very great
importance. they both had the same feeling, rather like that of a
schoolboy after an examination, which has left him in the same class or
shut him out of the school forever. everyone present, feeling too that
something had happened, talked eagerly about extraneous subjects. levin
and kitty were particularly happy and conscious of their love that
evening. and their happiness in their love seemed to i

d at the teachers for teaching the children so
badly. but he promised his sister-in-law to give the lessons exactly as
she wished. and he went on teaching grisha, not in his own way, but by
the book, and so took little interest in it, and often forgot the hour
of the lesson. so it had been today.

"no, iâ€™m going, dolly, you sit still," he said. "weâ€™ll do it all
properly, like the book. only when stiva comes, and we go out shooting,
then we shall have to miss it."

and levin went to grisha.

varenka was saying the same thing to kitty. even in the happy,
well-ordered household of the levins varenka had succeeded in making
herself useful.

"iâ€™ll see to the supper, you sit still," she said, and got up to go to
agafea mihalovna.

"yes, yes, most likely theyâ€™ve not been able to get chickens. if so,
ours..."

"agafea mihalovna and i will see about it," and varenka vanished with
her.

"what a nice girl!" said the princess.

"not nice, maman; sheâ€™s an exquisite girl; thereâ€™s no one else li

her."

"so you are expecting stepan arkadyevitch today?" said sergey
ivanovitch, evidently not disposed to pursue the conversation about
varenka. "it would be difficult to find two sons-in-law more unlike than
yours," he said with a subtle smile. "one all movement, only living in
society, like a fish in water; the other our kostya, lively, alert,
quick in everything, but as soon as he is in society, he either sinks
into apathy, or struggles helplessly like a fish on land."

"yes, heâ€™s very heedless," said the princess, addressing sergey
ivanovitch. "iâ€™ve been meaning, indeed, to ask you to tell him that itâ€™s
out of the question fo

 love. so what is she so pleased about?
revolting!" thought levin.

he looked at the princess, who had been so dear to him a minute before,
and he did not like the manner in which she welcomed this vassenka, with
his ribbons, just as though she were in her own house.

even sergey ivanovitch, who had come out too onto the steps, seemed to
him unpleasant with the show of cordiality with which he met stepan
arkadyevitch, though levin knew that his brother neither liked nor
respected oblonsky.

and varenka, even she seemed hateful, with her air _sainte nitouche_
making the acquaintance of this gentleman, while all the while she was
thinking of nothing but getting married.

and more hateful than anyone was kitty for falling in with the tone of
gaiety with which this gentleman regarded his visit in the country, as
though it were a holiday for himself and everyone else. and, above all,
unpleasant was that particular smile with which she responded to his
smile.

noisily talking, they all went into th

"nothing really, i suppose."

"do you know veslovsky has been at annaâ€™s, and heâ€™s going to them again?
you know theyâ€™re hardly fifty miles from you, and i too must certainly
go over there. veslovsky, come here!"

vassenka crossed over to the ladies, and sat down beside kitty.

"ah, do tell me, please; you have stayed with her? how was she?" darya
alexandrovna appealed to him.

levin was left at the other end of the table, and though never pausing
in his conversation with the princess and varenka, he saw that there was
an eager and mysterious conversation going on between stepan
arkadyevitch, dolly, kitty, and veslovsky. and that was not all. he saw
on his wifeâ€™s face an expression of real feeling as she gazed with fixed
eyes on the handsome face of vassenka, who was telling them something
with great animation.

"itâ€™s exceedingly nice at their place," veslovsky was telling them about
vronsky and anna. "i canâ€™t, of course, take it upon myself to judge, but
in their house you feel t

so awkwardly that she did not
like them.

"why, how can one want to go to bed!" said stepan arkadyevitch, who,
after drinking several glasses of wine at supper, was now in his most
charming and sentimental humor. "look, kitty," he said, pointing to the
moon, which had just risen behind the lime treesâ€”"how exquisite!
veslovsky, this is the time for a serenade. you know, he has a splendid
voice; we practiced songs together along the road. he has brought some
lovely songs with him, two new ones. varvara andreevna and he must sing
some duets."

when the party had broken up, stepan arkadyevitch walked a long while
about the avenue with veslovsky; their voices could be heard singing one
of the new songs.

levin hearing these voices sat scowling in an easy-chair in his wifeâ€™s
bedroom, and maintained an obstinate silence when she asked him what was
wrong. but when at last with a timid glance she hazarded the question:
"was there perhaps something you disliked about veslovsky?"â€”it all burst
out, and he tol

hould do just the same again.

in spite of all this, towards the end of that day, everyone except the
princess, who could not pardon levinâ€™s action, became extraordinarily
lively and good humored, like children after a punishment or grown-up
people after a dreary, ceremonious reception, so that by the evening
vassenkaâ€™s dismissal was spoken of, in the absence of the princess, as
though it were some remote event. and dolly, who had inherited her
fatherâ€™s gift of humorous storytelling, made varenka helpless with
laughter as she related for the third and fourth time, always with fresh
humorous additions, how she had only just put on her new shoes for the
benefit of the visitor, and on going into the drawing room, heard
suddenly the rumble of the trap. and who should be in the trap but
vassenka himself, with his scotch cap, and his songs and his gaiters,
and all, sitting in the hay.

"if only youâ€™d ordered out the carriage! but no! and then i hear:
â€˜stop!â€™ oh, i thought theyâ€™ve rele

looked to her healthy and happy, making her envious of
their enjoyment of life. "theyâ€™re all living, theyâ€™re all enjoying
life," darya alexandrovna still mused when she had passed the peasant
women and was driving uphill again at a trot, seated comfortably on the
soft springs of the old carriage, "while i, let out, as it were from
prison, from the world of worries that fret me to death, am only looking
about me now for an instant. they all live; those peasant women and my
sister natalia and varenka and anna, whom i am going to seeâ€”all, but not
i.

"and they attack anna. what for? am i any better? i have, anyway, a
husband i loveâ€”not as i should like to love him, still i do love him,
while anna never loved hers. how is she to blame? she wants to live. god
has put that in our hearts. very likely i should have done the same.
even to this day i donâ€™t feel sure i did right in listening to her at
that terrible time when she came to me in moscow. i ought then to have
