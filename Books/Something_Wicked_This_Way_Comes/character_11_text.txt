ered, doors boomed, keys rattled their bones in locks, people fled with
hordes of torn newspaper mice nibbling their heels.
bang! they were gone!
'boy!' yelled will. 'folks run like they thought the storm was here!'
'it is!' shouted jim. 'us!'
they stomp-pound-thundered over iron grates, steel trap-doors, past a dozen unlit shops, a
dozen half-lit, a dozen dying dark. the city was dead as they rounded the united cigar store
corner to see a wooden cherokee glide in darkness, by himself.
'hey!'
mr tetley, the proprietor, peered over the indian's shoulder.
'scare you, boys?'
'naw!'
but will shivered, feeling cold tidal waves of strange rain moving down the prairie as on a
deserted shore. when the lightning nailed the town, he wanted to be layered under sixteen
blankets and a pillow.
'mr tetley?' said will, quietly.
for now there were two wooden indians upright in ripe tobacco darkness. mr tetley, amidst
his jest, had frozen, mouth open, listening.
'mr tetley?'
he heard something far away on the

ing. who'd go to it?
'me.' jim stood quiet in the dark.
me, thought will, seeing the guillotine flash, the egyptian mirrors unfold accordions of light,
and the sulphur-skinned devil-man sipping lava, like gunpowder tea.
'that music…' jim murmured. 'calliope. must be coming tonight!'
'carnivals come at sunrise.'
‘yeah, but what about the licorice and cotton candy we smelled, close?'
and will thought of the smells and the sounds flowing on the river of wind from beyond the
darkening houses, mr tetley listening by his wooden indian friend, mr crosetti with the single
tear shining down his cheek, and the barber's pole sliding its red tongue up and around forever
out of nowhere and away to eternity.
will's teeth chattered.
'let's go home.'
'we are home!' cried jim, surprised.
for, not knowing it, they had reached their separate houses and now moved up separate
walks.
on his porch, jim leaned over and called softly.
'will.you're not mad?'
'heck, no.'
'we won't go by that street, that house, the

maller up there than he had last night, seen from
the side of the house. it would be like calling to one more boy passing. they didn't need one
more boy, they needed a general, no, a major general! he tried to see dad's face at the cigar
counter window, and discover whether it looked really older, firmer, stronger, than it did last
night washed with all the milk colours of the moon.but all he saw was dad's fingers twitching
nervously, his mouth working, as if he didn't dare ask his needs from mr tetley…
'one…that is…one twenty-five cent cigar.'
'my god,' said mr tetley, above. 'the man's rich!'
charles halloway took his time removing the cellophane, waiting for some hint, some move
on the part of the universe to show him where he was going, why he had come back this way
for a cigar he did not really want. he thought he heard himself called, twice, glanced swiftly at
the crowds, saw clowns passing with handbills, then lit the cigar he did not want from the
eternal blue-gas flame that bur

a film strip in his head, scanned it, bleated and blundered
back through the forest of legs to reach for and pull the illustrated man down where a whisper
was as good as a shout. mr dark listened, then fled, leaving the dwarf far behind.
reaching the cigar store indian, the illustrated man sank to his knees. clutching the steel
lattice-grille, he peered down in the pit.
below lay yellow newspapers, wilted candy wrappers, burnt cigars, and gum.
mr dark's cry was muffled fury.
'lose something?'
mr tetley blinked over his counter.
'the illustrated man clenched the grate, nodding once.
'i clean under the grate once a month for the money,' said mr tetley. 'how much you lose?
dime? quarter? half dollar?'
bing!
the illustrated man glared up.
in the cash-register window a small fire-red sign jumped high:
no sale.
37
the town clock struck seven.
the echoes of the great chime wandered in the unlit halls of the library.
an autumn leaf, very crisp, fell somewhere in the dark.but it was only the page of a

will nodded and whined so high and silently that only dogs, dogs who were no help, dogs
who could not speak, might hear.
and sure enough, looking obliquely over, he saw not one, not two, but three dogs who,
smelling the occasion, their own parade, now ran ahead, now fell behind, their tails like guidons
for the platoon.
bark! thought will, like in the movies! bark, bring the police!
but the dogs just smiled and trotted.
coincidence, please, thought will. just a small one!
mr. tetley! yes! will saw-but-did-not-see mr. tetley! rolling the wooden indian back into his
shop, closing for the night!
‘turn heads,’ murmured the illustrated man.
jim turned his head. will turned his head.
mr. tetley smiled.
‘smile,’ murmured mr. dark.
the two boys smiled.
‘hello!’ said mr. tetley.
‘say hello,’ someone whispered.
‘hello,’ said jim.
‘hello,’ said will.
the dogs barked.
‘a free ride at the carnival,’ murmured mr. dark.
‘free ride,’ said will.
‘at the ca

rnival!’ cracked jim.
then, like good machines, they shut up their smiles.
‘have fun!’ called mr. tetley.
the dogs barked joy.
the parade marched on.
‘fun,’ said mr. dark. ‘free rides. when the crowds go home, half an hour from now. we'll ride
jim round.you still want that, jim?’
hearing but not hearing, locked away in himself, will thought, jim, don't listen!
jim's eyes slid: wet or oily, it was hard to tell.
‘you'll travel with us, jim, and if mr. cooger doesn't survive (it's a near thing for him, we
haven't saved him yet, we'll try again now) but if he doesn't make it, jim, how would
