[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER], jack's fourth wife, is described as the quintessential
loving mother and spouse. slightly overweight, with a head full
of messy blond hair, [CHARACTER] bakes cookies for the children, tells
her husband everything, and, in her free time, reads tabloids to
the blind and teaches a course on posture to the elderly. in her
apparent honesty and sincerity, [CHARACTER] contrasts with jack's previous
wives, who were closed off and secretive. jack takes great comfort
from [CHARACTER] and the openness that characterizes their marriage.
[CHARACTER], however, has secretly been taking an experimental drug
called dylar. when first denise and then jack confront her about
the pills, [CHARACTER] completely denies any knowledge of it. only after
jack finds a pill and has it analyzed does [CHARACTER] confess that
she has been sleeping with a doctor in exchange for dylar, in the
hopes that the drug would relieve her own overwhelming fear of death.
the shift in [CHARACTER]'s personality, from open and loving to evasive
and cynical, reflects the novel's pervasive concern with the fluctuating
and unstable nature of identity.
