current was cut off during daylight hours. it was part of the economy drive
in preparation for hate week. the flat was seven flights up, and winston,
who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went
slowly, resting several times on the way. on each landing, opposite the
lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. it was
one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about
when you move. big brother is watching you, the caption beneath it ran.

inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had
something to do with the production of pig-iron. the voice came from an
oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface
of the right-hand wall. winston turned a switch and the voice sank
somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. the instrument
(the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of
shutting it off comple

blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.

outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. down in
the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into
spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there
seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered
everywhere. the black-moustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding
corner. there was one on the house-front immediately opposite. big brother
is watching you, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into
winston's own. down at street level another poster, torn at one corner,
flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the
single word ingsoc. in the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between
the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again
with a curving flight. it was the police patrol, snooping into people's
windows. the patrols did not matter, however. only the thought p

 that set one's teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the
back of one's neck. the hate had started.

as usual, the face of emmanuel goldstein, the enemy of the people, had
flashed on to the screen. there were hisses here and there among the
audience. the little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and
disgust. goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago
(how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading
figures of the party, almost on a level with big brother himself, and
then had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been condemned
to death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared. the programmes
of the two minutes hate varied from day to day, but there was none in
which goldstein was not the principal figure. he was the primal traitor,
the earliest defiler of the party's purity. all subsequent crimes against
the party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations,
sprang directly out of his teaching. somewhere or other h

 fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash
faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of
people like an electric current, turning one even against one's will into
a grimacing, screaming lunatic. and yet the rage that one felt was an
abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to
another like the flame of a blowlamp. thus, at one moment winston's hatred
was not turned against goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against
big brother, the party, and the thought police; and at such moments his
heart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian
of truth and sanity in a world of lies. and yet the very next instant he
was at one with the people about him, and all that was said of goldstein
seemed to him to be true. at those moments his secret loathing of big
brother changed into adoration, and big brother seemed to tower up, an
invincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordes

ldstein had become an actual
sheep's bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep.
then the sheep-face melted into the figure of a eurasian soldier who seemed
to be advancing, huge and terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, and
seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some of the
people in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats. but
in the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the
hostile figure melted into the face of big brother, black-haired,
black-moustachio'd, full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast that
it almost filled up the screen. nobody heard what big brother was saying.
it was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that are
uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually but
restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. then the face of big
brother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the party stood
out in bold capitals:

but the face of big brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the
screen, as though the impact that it had made on everyone's eyeballs was
too vivid to wear off immediately. the little sandy-haired woman had flung
herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her. with a
tremulous murmur that sounded like 'my saviour!' she extended her arms
towards the screen. then she buried her face in her hands. it was apparent
that she was uttering a prayer.

at this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep,

 slow,
rhythmical chant of 'b-b!...b-b!'--over and over again, very slowly, with a
long pause between the first 'b' and the second--a heavy, murmurous sound,
somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the
stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms. for perhaps as much as
thirty seconds they kept it up. it was a refrain that was often heard in
moments of overwhelming emotion. partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom
and majesty of big brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis,
a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise.
winston's entrails seemed to grow cold. in the two minutes hate he could
not help sharing in the general delirium, but this sub-human chanting of
'b-b!...b-b!' always filled him with horror. of course he chanted with the
rest: it was impossible to do otherwise. to dissemble your feelings, to
control your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive
reaction. but the

even that was a memorable event, in the locked loneliness in
which one had to live.

winston roused himself and sat up straighter. he let out a belch. the gin
was rising from his stomach.

his eyes re-focused on the page. he discovered that while he sat helplessly
musing he had also been writing, as though by automatic action. and it was
no longer the same cramped, awkward handwriting as before. his pen had slid
voluptuously over the smooth paper, printing in large neat capitals--


  down with big brother
  down with big brother

over and over again, filling half a page.

he could not help feeling a twinge of panic. it was absurd, since the
writing of those particular words was not more dangerous than the initial
act of opening the diary, but for a moment he was tempted to tear out the
spoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether.

he did not do so, however, because he knew that it was useless. whether he

no difference. whether he went on with the diary, or whether he did not go
on with it, made no difference. the thought police would get him just the
same. he had committed--would still have committed, even if he had never
set pen to paper--the essential crime that contained all others in itself.
thoughtcrime, they called it. thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be

simply disappeared, always during the night. your name was removed from the
registers, every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out, your

annihilated: vaporized was the usual word.

for a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria. he began writing in a
hurried untidy scrawl:


   theyll shoot me i don't care theyll shoot me in the back of the neck i
dont care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of the
neck i dont care down with big brother----


he sat back in his chair, slightly ashamed of himself, and laid down
the pen. the next moment he started violently. there was a knocking at
the door.

already! he sat as still as a mouse, in the futile hope that whoever it was
might go away after a single attempt. but no, the knocking was repeated.
the worst thing of all would be to delay. his heart was thumping like a
drum, but his face, from long habit, was

as he put his hand to the door-knob winston saw that he had left the
diary open on the table. down with big brother was written all over it,
in letters almost big enough to be legible across the room. it was an
inconceivably stupid thing to have done. but, he realized, even in his
panic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the book
while the ink was wet.

he drew in his breath and opened the door. instantly a warm wave of relief
flowed through him. a colourless, crushed-looking woman, with wispy hair
and a lined face, was standing outside.

'oh, comrade,' she began in a dreary, whining so

parsons' flat was bigger than winston's, and dingy in a different
way. everything had a battered, trampled-on look, as though the
place had just been visited by some large violent animal. games
impedimenta--hockey-sticks, boxing-gloves, a burst football, a pair of
sweaty shorts turned inside out--lay all over the floor, and on the
table there was a litter of dirty dishes and dog-eared exercise-books.
on the walls were scarlet banners of the youth league and the spies, and
a full-sized poster of big brother. there was the usual boiled-cabbage
smell, common to the whole building, but it was shot through by a sharper
reek of sweat, which--one knew this at the first sniff, though it was
hard to say how--was the sweat of some person not present at the moment.
in another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper was
trying to keep tune with the military music which was still issuing
from the telescreen.

toms of unorthodoxy. nearly all children nowadays were
horrible. what was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as
the spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages,
and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the
discipline of the party. on the contrary, they adored the party and
everything connected with it. the songs, the processions, the banners, the
hiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the yelling of slogans, the worship
of big brother--it was all a sort of glorious game to them. all their
ferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the state, against
foreigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals. it was almost normal
for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children. and with
good reason, for hardly a week passed in which 'the times' did not carry

was the phrase generally used--had overheard some compromising remark

human creature now living was on his side? and what way of knowing that the
dominion of the party would not endure for ever? like an answer, the three
slogans on the white face of the ministry of truth came back to him:


  war is peace
  freedom is slavery

he took a twenty-five cent piece out of his pocket. there, too, in tiny
clear lettering, the same slogans were inscribed, and on the other face of
the coin the head of big brother. even from the coin the eyes pursued you.

long as he uttered it, in some obscure way the continuity was not broken.
it was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on
the human heritage. he went back to the table, dipped his pen, and wrote:

are different from one another and do not live alone--to a time when truth
exists and what is done cannot be undone:

big brother, from the age of doublethink--greetings!


he was already dead, he reflected. it seemed to him that it was only now,
when he had begun to be able to formulate his thoughts, that he had taken
the decisive step. the consequences of every act are included in the act
itself. he wrote:


   thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime is death.


now he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stay
alive as long as possible. two fingers of his right hand were inkstained.

the girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the field. with
what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them
disdainfully aside. her body was white and smooth, but it aroused no desire
in him, indeed he barely looked at it. what overwhelmed him in that instant
was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside.
with its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture,
a whole system of thought, as though big brother and the party and the
thought police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid
movement of the arm. that too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time.
winston woke up with the word 'shakespeare' on his lips.

the telescreen was giving forth an ear-splitting whistle which continued on
the same note for thirty seconds. it was nought seven fifteen, getting-up

winston loathed this exercise, which sent shooting pains all the way from
his heels to his buttocks and often ended by bringing on another coughing
fit. the half-pleasant quality went out of his meditations. the past, he
reflected, had not merely been altered, it had been actually destroyed. for
how could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed no
record outside your own memory? he tried to remember in what year he had
first heard mention of big brother. he thought it must have been at some
time in the sixties, but it was impossible to be certain. in the party
histories, of course, big brother figured as the leader and guardian of the
revolution since its very earliest days. his exploits had been gradually
pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous
world of the forties and the thirties, when the capitalists in their
strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of london in great

necessary to alter, or, as the official phrase had it, to rectify. for
example, it appeared from 'the times' of the seventeenth of march that big
brother, in his speech of the previous day, had predicted that the south
indian front would remain quiet but that a eurasian offensive would shortly
be launched in north africa. as it happened, the eurasian higher command
had launched its offensive in south india and left north africa alone. it
was therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of big brother's speech, in
such a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened. or
again, 'the times' of the nineteenth of december had published the official
forecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in the
fourth quarter of 1983, which was also the sixth quarter of the ninth
three-year plan. today's issue contained a statement of the actual output,
from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly
wrong. winston's job was to rectify the origin

rinciples of ingsoc and your
estimate of what the party wanted you to say. winston was good at this kind
of thing. on occasion he had even been entrusted with the rectification of
'the times' leading articles, which were written entirely in newspeak.
he unrolled the message that he had set aside earlier. it ran:


   times 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons

in oldspeak (or standard english) this might be rendered:


the reporting of big brother's order for the day in 'the times' of december
3rd 1983 is extremely unsatisfactory and makes references to non-existent
persons. rewrite it in full and submit your draft to higher authority
before filing.


winston read through the offending article. big brother's order for the
day, it seemed, had been chiefly devoted to praising the work of an
organization known as ffcc, which supplied cigarettes and other comforts
to the sailors in the floating fortresses. a certain comrade withers, a

l crouching secretively over
his speakwrite. he raised his head for a moment: again the hostile
spectacle-flash. winston wondered whether comrade tillotson was engaged
on the same job as himself. it was perfectly possible. so tricky a piece
of work would never be entrusted to a single person: on the other hand,
to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act of
fabrication was taking place. very likely as many as a dozen people were
now working away on rival versions of what big brother had actually said.
and presently some master brain in the inner party would select this
version or that, would re-edit it and set in motion the complex processes
of cross-referencing that would be required, and then the chosen lie
would pass into the permanent records and become truth.

winston did not know why withers had been disgraced. perhaps it was for
corruption or incompetence. perhaps big brother was merely getting rid of
a too-popular subordinate. perhaps withers or someone close to hi

etimes they were released and allowed to remain at liberty
for as much as a year or two years before being executed. very occasionally
some person whom you had believed dead long since would make a ghostly
reappearance at some public trial where he would implicate hundreds of
others by his testimony before vanishing, this time for ever. withers,
however, was already an unperson. he did not exist: he had never existed.
winston decided that it would not be enough simply to reverse the tendency
of big brother's speech. it was better to make it deal with something
totally unconnected with its original subject.

he might turn the speech into the usual denunciation of traitors and
thought-criminals, but that was a little too obvious, while to invent a
victory at the front, or some triumph of over-production in the ninth
three-year plan, might complicate the records too much. what was needed
was a piece of pure fantasy. suddenly there sprang into his mind, ready
made as it were, the image of a certain c

cumstances. there were occasions when big
brother devoted his order for the day to commemorating some humble,
rank-and-file party member whose life and death he held up as an example
worthy to be followed. today he should commemorate comrade ogilvy. it was
true that there was no such person as comrade ogilvy, but a few lines of
print and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him into
existence.

winston thought for a moment, then pulled the speakwrite towards him and
began dictating in big brother's familiar style: a style at once military
and pedantic, and, because of a trick of asking questions and then
promptly answering them ('what lessons do we learn from this fact,
comrades? the lesson--which is also one of the fundamental principles
of ingsoc--that,' etc., etc.), easy to imitate.

at the age of three comrade ogilvy had refused all toys except a drum, a
sub-machine gun, and a model helicopter. at six--a year early, by a special
relaxation of the rules--he had joined the spies, at n

perished in action. pursued by enemy jet planes while flying over the
indian ocean with important despatches, he had weighted his body with his
machine gun and leapt out of the helicopter into deep water, despatches
and all--an end, said big brother, which it was impossible to contemplate
without feelings of envy. big brother added a few remarks on the purity
and single-mindedness of comrade ogilvy's life. he was a total abstainer
and a nonsmoker, had no recreations except a daily hour in the gymnasium,
and had taken a vow of celibacy, believing marriage and the care of a
family to be incompatible with a twenty-four-hour-a-day devotion to duty.

them? "plusgood" covers the meaning, or "doubleplusgood" if you
want something stronger still. of course we use those forms already. but
in the final version of newspeak there'll be nothing else. in the end the
whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words--in
reality, only one word. don't you see the beauty of that, winston? it was
b.b.'s idea originally, of course,' he added as an afterthought.

a sort of vapid eagerness flitted across winston's face at the mention of
big brother. nevertheless syme immediately detected a certain lack of
enthusiasm.

'you haven't a real appreciation of newspeak, winston,' he said almost
sadly. 'even when you write it you're still thinking in oldspeak. i've read
some of those pieces that you write in "the times" occasionally. they're
good enough, but they're translations. in your heart you'd prefer to stick

like a line of type cast solid. for the rest it was just a noise, a
quack-quack-quacking. and yet, though you could not actually hear what the
man was saying, you could not be in any doubt about its general nature.
he might be denouncing goldstein and demanding sterner measures against
thought-criminals and saboteurs, he might be fulminating against the
atrocities of the eurasian army, he might be praising big brother or the
heroes on the malabar front--it made no difference. whatever it was, you
could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pure ingsoc.
as he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down,
winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but
some kind of dummy. it was not the man's brain that was speaking, it was
his larynx. the stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but
it was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttere

with the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week it was seldom possible to

held carefully horizontal. the new ration did not start till tomorrow and
he had only four cigarettes left. for the moment he had shut his ears to
the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the
telescreen. it appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank
big brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week. and
only yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ration was
to be reduced to twenty grammes a week. was it possible that they could
swallow that, after only twenty-four hours? yes, they swallowed it. parsons
swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal. the eyeless creature
at the other table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a furious
desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should sugg

what counted--concrete, unmistakable evidence of an act of
falsification. he had held it between his fingers for as long as thirty
seconds. in 1973, it must have been--at any rate, it was at about the time
when he and katharine had parted. but the really relevant date was seven
or eight years earlier.

the story really began in the middle sixties, the period of the great
purges in which the original leaders of the revolution were wiped out
once and for all. by 1970 none of them was left, except big brother
himself. all the rest had by that time been exposed as traitors and
counter-revolutionaries. goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew
where, and of the others, a few had simply disappeared, while the majority
had been executed after spectacular public trials at which they made
confession of their crimes. among the last survivors were three men named
jones, aaronson, and rutherford. it must have been in 1965 that these three
had been arrested. as often happened, they had vanished for a year

so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead, and then had
suddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual way.
they had confessed to intelligence with the enemy (at that date, too, the
enemy was eurasia), embezzlement of public funds, the murder of various
trusted party members, intrigues against the leadership of big brother
which had started long before the revolution happened, and acts of sabotage
causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people. after confessing to
these things they had been pardoned, reinstated in the party, and given
posts which were in fact sinecures but which sounded important. all three
had written long, abject articles in 'the times', analysing the reasons
for their defection and promising to make amends.

some time after their release winston had actually seen all three of them
in the

 cafe. he remembered the sort of terrified fascination
with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye. they were men
far older than himself, relics of the ancient world, almost the last great
figures left over from the heroic days of the party. the glamour of the
underground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them. he had
the feeling, though already at that time facts and dates were growing
blurry, that he had known their names years earlier than he had known that
of big brother. but also they were outlaws, enemies, untouchables, doomed
with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two. no one who had
once fallen into the hands of the thought police ever escaped in the end.
they were corpses waiting to be sent back to the grave.

there was no one at any of the tables nearest to them. it was not wise
even to be seen in the neighbourhood of such people. they were sitting

a lunatic. perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one. at one time it
had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun;
today, to believe that the past is unalterable. he might be alone in
holding that belief, and if alone, then a lunatic. but the thought of being
a lunatic did not greatly trouble him: the horror was that he might also
be wrong.

he picked up the children's history book and looked at the portrait of
big brother which formed its frontispiece. the hypnotic eyes gazed into
his own. it was as though some huge force were pressing down upon
you--something that penetrated inside your skull, battering against your
brain, frightening you out of your beliefs, persuading you, almost, to
deny the evidence of your senses. in the end the party would announce that

that they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their

there is no darkness was the imagined future, which one would never see,
but which, by foreknowledge, one could mystically share in. but with the
voice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the train
of thought further. he put a cigarette in his mouth. half the tobacco
promptly fell out on to his tongue, a bitter dust which was difficult to
spit out again. the face of big brother swam into his mind, displacing that
of o'brien. just as he had done a few days earlier, he slid a coin out of
his pocket and looked at it. the face gazed up at him, heavy, calm,
protecting: but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache?
like a leaden knell the words came back at him:

not speak again, and, so far as it was possible for two people sitting on
opposite sides of the same table, they did not look at one another. the
girl finished her lunch quickly and made off, while winston stayed to
smoke a cigarette.

winston was in victory square before the appointed time. he wandered round
the base of the enormous fluted column, at the top of which big brother's
statue gazed southward towards the skies where he had vanquished the
eurasian aeroplanes (the eastasian aeroplanes, it had been, a few years
ago) in the battle of airstrip one. in the street in front of it there was
a statue of a man on horseback which was supposed to represent oliver
cromwell. at five minutes past the hour the girl had still not appeared.
again the terrible fear seized upon winston. she was not coming, she had
changed her mind! he walked slowly up to the north side of the sq

xual privation induced hysteria, which was desirable
because it could be transformed into war-fever and leader-worship. the way
she put it was:

'when you make love you're using up energy; and afterwards you feel happy
and don't give a damn for anything. they can't bear you to feel like that.
they want you to be bursting with energy all the time. all this marching
up and down and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour. if
you're happy inside yourself, why should you get excited about big brother
and the three-year plans and the two minutes hate and all the rest of
their bloody rot?'

that was very true, he thought. there was a direct intimate connexion
between chastity and political orthodoxy. for how could the fear, the
hatred, and the lunatic credulity which the party needed in its members be

 suddenly appeared all over london. it had no caption,
and represented simply the monstrous figure of a eurasian soldier, three
or four metres high, striding forward with expressionless mongolian face
and enormous boots, a submachine gun pointed from his hip. from whatever
angle you looked at the poster, the muzzle of the gun, magnified by the
foreshortening, seemed to be pointed straight at you. the thing had been
plastered on every blank space on every wall, even outnumbering the
portraits of big brother. the proles, normally apathetic about the war,
were being lashed into one of their periodical frenzies of patriotism.
as though to harmonize with the general mood, the rocket bombs had been
killing larger numbers of people than usual. one fell on a crowded film
theatre in stepney, burying several hundred victims among the ruins. the
whole population of the neighbourhood turned out for a long, trailing
funeral which went on for hours and was in effect an indignation meeting.

he halted and looked for the third time at his wrist-watch.

'it is almost time for you to leave, comrade,' he said to julia. 'wait.
the decanter is still half full.'

he filled the glasses and raised his own glass by the stem.

'what shall it be this time?' he said, still with the same faint
suggestion of irony. 'to the confusion of the thought police? to the
death of big brother? to humanity? to the future?'

'to the past,' said winston.

'the past is more important,' agreed o'brien gravely.

they emptied their glasses, and a moment later julia stood up to go.
o'brien took a small box from the top of a cabinet and handed her a flat
white tablet which he told her to place on her tongue. it was important,
he said, not to go out smelling of wine: the lift attendants were very
observant. as soon as the door had shut behind her he appeared to forget
her existence. he took a

ry people, and the growth of liberalism and
scepticism in their own ranks. the problem, that is to say, is educational.
it is a problem of continuously moulding the consciousness both of the
directing group and of the larger executive group that lies immediately
below it. the consciousness of the masses needs only to be influenced in
a negative way.

given this background, one could infer, if one did not know it already,
the general structure of oceanic society. at the apex of the pyramid comes
big brother. big brother is infallible and all-powerful. every success,
every achievement, every victory, every scientific discovery, all
knowledge, all wisdom, all happiness, all virtue, are held to issue
directly from his leadership and inspiration. nobody has ever seen big
brother. he is a face on the hoardings, a voice on the telescreen. we
may be reasonably sure that he will never die, and there is already
considerable uncertainty as to when he was born. big brother is the guise
in which the party cho

to act as a focusing point for love, fear, and reverence, emotions which
are more easily felt towards an individual than towards an organization.
below big brother comes the inner party. its numbers limited to six
millions, or something less than 2 per cent of the population of oceania.
below the inner party comes the outer party, which, if the inner party is
described as the brain of the state, may be justly likened to the hands.
below that come the dumb masses whom we habitually refer to as 'the
proles', numbering perhaps 85 per cent of the population. in the terms
of our earlier classification, the proles are the low: for the slave

 failing to
perceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if
they are inimical to ingsoc, and of being bored or repelled by any train
of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction. crimestop,
in short, means protective stupidity. but stupidity is not enough. on the
contrary, orthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over one's own
mental processes as complete as that of a contortionist over his body.
oceanic society rests ultimately on the belief that big brother is
omnipotent and that the party is infallible. but since in reality big
brother is not omnipotent and the party is not infallible, there is need
for an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts.
the keyword here is blackwhite. like so many newspeak words, this word has
two mutually contradictory meanings. applied to an opponent, it means the
habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the
plain facts. applied to a party member, it means a loya

expression. 'thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing, old man,'
he said sententiously. 'it's insidious. it can get hold of you without
your even knowing it. do you know how it got hold of me? in my sleep! yes,
that's a fact. there i was, working away, trying to do my bit--never knew
i had any bad stuff in my mind at all. and then i started talking in my
sleep. do you know what they heard me saying?'

he sank his voice, like someone who is obliged for medical reasons to
utter an obscenity.

'"down with big brother!" yes, i said that! said it over and over again,
it seems. between you and me, old man, i'm glad they got me before it went
any further. do you know what i'm going to say to them when i go up before
the tribunal? "thank you," i'm going to say, "thank you for saving me
before it was too late."'

'who denounced you?' said winston.

our, tripping him up, laying traps for
him, twisting everything that he said, convicting him at every step of
lies and self-contradiction until he began weeping as much from shame as
from nervous fatigue. sometimes he would weep half a dozen times in a
single session. most of the time they screamed abuse at him and threatened
at every hesitation to deliver him over to the guards again; but sometimes
they would suddenly change their tune, call him comrade, appeal to him in
the name of ingsoc and big brother, and ask him sorrowfully whether even
now he had not enough loyalty to the party left to make him wish to
undo the evil he had done. when his nerves were in rags after hours of
questioning, even this appeal could reduce him to snivelling tears. in the
end the nagging voices broke him down more completely than the boots and
fists of the guards. he became simply a mouth that uttered, a hand that
signed, whatever was demanded of him. his sole concern was to find out
what they wanted him to confess

believed--jones, aaronson, and rutherford--in the end we broke them down.
i took part in their interrogation myself. i saw them gradually worn down,
whimpering, grovelling, weeping--and in the end it was not with pain or
fear, only with penitence. by the time we had finished with them they were
only the shells of men. there was nothing left in them except sorrow for
what they had done, and love of big brother. it was touching to see
how they loved him. they begged to be shot quickly, so that they could die
while their minds were still clean.'

his voice had grown almost dreamy. the exaltation, the lunatic enthusiasm,
was still in his face. he is not pretending, thought winston, he is not a
hypocrite, he believes every word he says. what most oppressed him was the
consciousness of his own intellectual inferiority. he watched the heavy
yet graceful form strolling to and fro, in and out of the range of

. what is your first question?'

'what have you done with julia?' said winston.

o'brien smiled again. 'she betrayed you, winston. immediately--unreservedly.
i have seldom seen anyone come over to us so promptly. you would hardly
recognize her if you saw her. all her rebelliousness, her deceit, her
folly, her dirty-mindedness--everything has been burned out of her. it was
a perfect conversion, a textbook case.'

'you tortured her?'

o'brien left this unanswered. 'next question,' he said.

'does big brother exist?'

'of course he exists. the party exists. big brother is the embodiment of
the party.'

'does he exist in the same way as i exist?'

'you do not exist,' said o'brien.

once again the sense of helplessness assailed him. he knew, or he could
imagine, the arguments which proved his own nonexistence; but they were
nonsense, they were only a play on words. did not the statement, 'you do
not exist', contain a logical absurdity? but what use was it to say so?
his mind shrivelled as he thought o

f the unanswerable, mad arguments with
which o'brien would demolish him.

'i think i exist,' he said wearily. 'i am conscious of my own identity.
i was born and i shall die. i have arms and legs. i occupy a particular
point in space. no other solid object can occupy the same point
simultaneously. in that sense, does big brother exist?'

'it is of no importance. he exists.'

'will big brother ever die?'

'of course not. how could he die? next question.'

'does the brotherhood exist?'

'that, winston, you will never know. if we choose to set you free when we
have finished with you, and if you live to be ninety years old, still you
will never learn whether the answer to that question is yes or no. as long
as you live it will be an unsolved riddle in your mind.'

winston lay silent. his breast rose and fell a little faster. he still had

man and woman. no one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend
any longer. but in the future there will be no wives and no friends.
children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from
a hen. the sex instinct will be eradicated. procreation will be an annual
formality like the renewal of a ration card. we shall abolish the orgasm.
our neurologists are at work upon it now. there will be no loyalty, except
loyalty towards the party. there will be no love, except the love of
big brother. there will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over
a defeated enemy. there will be no art, no literature, no science. when
we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. there will be
no distinction between beauty and ugliness. there will be no curiosity,
no enjoyment of the process of life. all competing pleasures will be
destroyed. but always--do not forget this, winston--always there will be
the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing
subtler.

ld have blown his brain to pieces
before they could reclaim it. the heretical thought would be unpunished,
unrepented, out of their reach for ever. they would have blown a hole in
their own perfection. to die hating them, that was freedom.

he shut his eyes. it was more difficult than accepting an intellectual
discipline. it was a question of degrading himself, mutilating himself. he
had got to plunge into the filthiest of filth. what was the most horrible,
sickening thing of all? he thought of big brother. the enormous face
(because of constantly seeing it on posters he always thought of it as
being a metre wide), with its heavy black moustache and the eyes that
followed you to and fro, seemed to float into his mind of its own accord.
what were his true feelings towards big brother?

there was a heavy tramp of boots in the passage. the steel door swung open
with a clang. o'brien walked into the cell. behind him were the waxen-faced
officer and the black-uniformed guards.

'get up,' said o'brien.

ook winston's shoulders between his
strong hands and looked at him closely.

'you have had thoughts of deceiving me,' he said. 'that was stupid.
stand up straighter. look me in the face.'

he paused, and went on in a gentler tone:

'you are improving. intellectually there is very little wrong with you.
it is only emotionally that you have failed to make progress. tell me,
winston--and remember, no lies: you know that i am always able to detect
a lie--tell me, what are your true feelings towards big brother?'

'i hate him.'

'you hate him. good. then the time has come for you to take the last step.
you must love big brother. it is not enough to obey him: you must love
him.'

he released winston with a little push towards the guards.

'room 101,' he said.

chapter 6



the chestnut tree was almost empty. a ray of sunlight slanting through a
window fell on dusty table-tops. it was the lonely hour of fifteen. a
tinny music trickled from the telescreens.

winston sat in his usual corner, gazing into an empty glass. now and again
he glanced up at a vast face which eyed him from the opposite wall.
big brother is watching you, the caption said. unbidden, a waiter came and
filled his glass up with victory gin, shaking into it a few drops from
another bottle with a quill through the cork. it was saccharine flavoured
with cloves, the speciality of the cafe.

winston was listening to the telescreen. at present only music was coming
out of it, but there was a possibility that at any moment there might be
a special bulletin from the ministry of peace. the news from the african
front was disquieting in the

from the telescreen stopped and a voice took over. winston raised
his head to listen. no bulletins from the front, however. it was merely a
brief announcement from the ministry of plenty. in the preceding quarter,
it appeared, the tenth three-year plan's quota for bootlaces had been
overfulfilled by 98 per cent.

he examined the chess problem and set out the pieces. it was a tricky
ending, involving a couple of knights. 'white to play and mate in two
moves.' winston looked up at the portrait of big brother. white always
mates, he thought with a sort of cloudy mysticism. always, without
exception, it is so arranged. in no chess problem since the beginning of
the world has black ever won. did it not symbolize the eternal, unvarying
triumph of good over evil? the huge face gazed back at him, full of calm
power. white always mates.

the voice from the telescreen paused and added in a different and much
graver tone: 'you are warned to stand by for an important announcement at
fifteen-thirty. fifteen-t

strategic manoeuvre--perfect co-ordination--utter rout--half a million
prisoners--complete demoralization--control of the whole of africa--bring
the war within measurable distance of its end--victory--greatest victory
in human history--victory, victory, victory!'

under the table winston's feet made convulsive movements. he had not
stirred from his seat, but in his mind he was running, swiftly running,
he was with the crowds outside, cheering himself deaf. he looked up again
at the portrait of big brother. the colossus that bestrode the world!
the rock against which the hordes of asia dashed themselves in vain! he
thought how ten minutes ago--yes, only ten minutes--there had still been
equivocation in his heart as he wondered whether the news from the front
would be of victory or defeat. ah, it was more than a eurasian army that
had perished! much had changed in him since that first day in the ministry
of love, but the final, indispensable, healing change had never happened,
until this moment.

ing in sunlight, and an armed guard at his back. the long-hoped-for
bullet was entering his brain.

he gazed up at the enormous face. forty years it had taken him to learn
what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache. o cruel, needless
misunderstanding! o stubborn, self-willed exile from the loving breast!
two gin-scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose. but it was all
right, everything was all right, the struggle was finished. he had won
the victory over himself. he loved big brother.

the principles of newspeak



newspeak was the official language of oceania and had been devised to meet
the ideological needs of ingsoc, or english socialism. in the year 1984
there was not as yet anyone who used newspeak as his sole means of
communication, either in speech or writing. the leading articles in
'the times' were written in it, but this was a tour de force which could
only be carried out by a specialist. it was expected that newspeak would
have finally su

of mind, or a method of thought, irrespective of its particular
branches. there was, indeed, no word for 'science', any meaning that it
could possibly bear being already sufficiently covered by the word ingsoc.

from the foregoing account it will be seen that in newspeak the expression
of unorthodox opinions, above a very low level, was well-nigh impossible.
it was of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind, a
species of blasphemy. it would have been possible, for example, to say
big brother is ungood. but this statement, which to an orthodox ear merely
conveyed a self-evident absurdity, could not have been sustained by
reasoned argument, because the necessary words were not available. ideas
inimical to ingsoc could only be entertained in a vague wordless form,
and could only be named in very broad terms which lumped together and
condemned whole groups of heresies without defining them in doing so.
one could, in fact, only use newspeak for unorthodox purposes by
illegitimately tran
