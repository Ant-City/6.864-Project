pattering surface like grease on a hot stove. i told you i'd make you

      then we heard the running and we stopped and looked back and saw 
him coming up the path running, the level shadows flicking upon his legs.   
     "he's in a hurry. we'd--" then i saw another man, an oldish man 
running heavily, clutching a stick, and a boy naked from the waist up, 
clutching his pants as he ran.   
     " there's julio," the little girl said, and then i saw his italian face and his 
eyes as he sprang upon me. we went down. his hands were jabbing at my 
face and he was saying something and trying to bite me, i reckon, and then 
they hauled him off and held him heaving and thrashing and yelling and 
they held his arms and he tried to kick me until they dragged him back. 
the little girl was howling, holding the loaf in both arms. the half naked 
boy was darting and jumping up and down, clutching his trousers an

someone pulled me up in time to see another stark naked figure come 
around the tranquil bend in the path running and change direction in 
midstride and leap into the woods, a couple of garments rigid as boards 
behind it. julio still struggled. the man who had pulled me up said, 
"whoa, now. we got you." he wore a vest but no coat. upon it was a met 
shield in his other hand he clutched a knotted, polished stick.   
     " you're anse, aren't you?" i said. "i was looking for you. what's the 
matter?"   
     "i warn you that anything you say will be used aganst you," he said. 
"you're under arrest."   
     " i killa heem," julio said. he struggled. two men held him. the little 
girl howled steadily, holding the bread

. "you steala my seester," julio said. 
"let go, meesters."   
     " steal his sister?" i said. "why, i've been--"   
     "shet up," anse said. "you can tell that to squire."   

     " steal his sister?" i said. julio broke from the men and sprang at me 
again, but the marshal met him and they struggled until the other two 
pinioned his arms again. anse released him, panting.   
     "you durn furriner," he said. "i've a good mind to take you up too, for 
assault and battery." he turned to me again. "will you come peaceable, or 
do i handcuff you?" "i'll come peaceable," i said. "anything, just so i can 
find someone--do something with-- stole his sister," i said. "stole his--"

d the water swif and peaceful below the path. after a while 
the laughter ran out. but my throat wouldn't quit trying to laugh, like 
retching after your stomach is empty.   
     "whoa, now," anse said. "get a grip on yourself."   
     "yes," i said, tightening my throat. there was another yellow butterfly, 
like one of the sunflecks had come loose. after a while i didn't have to hold 
my throat so tight. i got up. "i'm ready. which way?"   
      we followed the path, the two others watching julio and the little girl 
and the boys somewhere in the rear. the path went along the river to the 
bridge. we crossed it and the tracks, people coming to the doors to look at 
us and more boys materialising from somewhere until when we turned into 
the main street we had quite a procession. before the drug store stood an 
auto, a big one, but i didn't recognise them until mrs bland said,   
     " why, quentin! quentin compson!" then i saw gerald, and spoade in 
the back seat, sitting on the back o

    "well, good afternoon," i said. "i'm glad to have seen you all. sorry i 
couldn't be with you."   
     "you, gerald," mrs bland said.   
     "look here, constable," gerald said.   
     "i warn you you're interfering with an officer of the law," anse said. "if 
you've anything to say, you can come to the squire's and make cognizance 
of the prisoner." we went on. quite a procession now, anse and i leading. i 
could hear them telling them what it was, and spoade asking questions, 
and then julio said something violently in italian and i looked back and 
saw the little girl standing at the curb, looking at me with her friendly, 
inscrutable regard.   
     "git on home," julio shouted at her. "i beat hell outa you."   
      we went down the street and turned into a bit of lawn in which, set 
back from the street, stood a one storey building of brick trimmed with 
white. we went up the rock path to the door, where anse halted everyone 
except us and made them remain outside. we entered,

shut up, bud," spoade said. "let him do it his way. he's going to 
anyhow."   
     "age," the squire said. i told him. he wrote that, his mouth moving as he 
wrote. "occupation." i told him. "harvard student, hey?" he said. he 
looked up at me, bowing his neck a little to see over the spectacles. his eyes 
were clear and cold, like a goat's. "what are you up to, coming out here 
kidnapping children?"   
     "they're crazy, squire," shreve said. "whoever says this boy's 
kidnapping--"   
      julio moved violently. "crazy?" he said. "dont i catcha heem, eh? dont 
i see weetha my own eyesâ€“-"   
     "you're a liar," shreve said. "you never--"   
     "order, order," anse said, raising his voice.   
     "you fellers shet up," the squire said. "if they dont stay quiet, turn 'em 
out, anse." they got quiet. the squire looked at shreve, then at spoade, 
then at gerald. "you know this young man?" he said to spoade.   
     "yes, your honor," spoade said. "he's just a country boy in school up

there. he dont mean any harm. i think the marshal'll find it's a mistake. 
his father's a congregational minister."   
     "h'm," the squire said. "what was you doing, exactly?" i told him, he 
watching me with his cold, pale eyes. "how about it, anse?"   
     "might have been," anse said. "them durn furriners."   
     "i american," julio said. "i gotta da pape'."   
     "where's the gal?"   
     "he sent her home," anse said.   
     "was she scared or anything?"   

     "not till julio there jumped on the prisoner. they were just walking 
along the river path, towards town. some boys swimming told us which 
way they went."   
     "it's a mistake, squire," spoade said. "children and dogs are always 
taking up with him like that. he cant help it."   
     "h'm," the squire said. he looked out of the window for a while. we 
watched him. i could hear julio scratching himself. the squire looked 
back.   
     "air you satisfied the gal aint took any hurt, you, there?"   
     "no

 hurt now," julio said sullenly.   
     "you quit work to hunt for her?"   
     "sure i quit. i run. i run like hell. looka here, looka there, then man 
tella me he seen him give her she eat. she go weetha."   
     "h'm," the squire said. "well, son, i calculate you owe julio something 
for taking him away from his work."   
     "yes, sir," i said. "how much?"   
     "dollar, i calculate."   
      i gave julio a dollar.   
     "well," spoade said. "if that's all--i reckon he's discharged, your 
honor?"   
      the squire didn't look at him. "how far'd you run him, anse?"   
     "two miles, at least. it was about two hours before we caught him."   
     "h'm," the squire said. he mused a while. we watched him, his stiff 
crest, the spectacles riding low on his nose. the yellow shape of the 
window grew slowly across the floor, reached the wall, climbing. dust 
motes whirled and slanted. "six dollar

the ladies are waiting for us. you got six dollars?"   
     "yes," i said. i gave him six dollars.   
     "case dismissed," he said.   
     "you get a receipt," shreve said. "you get a signed receipt for that 

money."   
      the squire looked at shreve mildly. "case dismissed," he said without 
raising his voice.   
     "i'll be damned--" shreve said.   
     "come on here," spoade said, taking his arm. "good afternoon, judge. 
much obliged." as we passed out the door julio's voice rose again, violent, 
then ceased. spoade was looking at me, his brown eyes quizzical, a little 
cold. "well, bud, i reckon you'll do your girl chasing in boston after this."   
     "you damned fool," shreve said. "what the hell do you mean anyway, 
straggling off here, fooling with these damn wops?"   
     "come on," spoade said. "they must be getting impatient."   
      mrs bland was talking to them. they were miss holmes and miss 
daingerfield and they quit listening to her and lo
