have letters from me to some friends that will
sweep your way for you. pray you, look not sad,

nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
to grace it with your sorrows: bid that welcome
which comes to punish us, and we punish it,
seeming to bear it lightly. take me up:
i have led you oft: carry me now, good friends,
