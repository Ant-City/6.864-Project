blue uniform.

"may i come in?" the agent asked.

langdon hesitated, feeling uncertain as the stranger's sallow eyes studied him. "what is this all
about?"

"my capitaine requires your expertise in a private matter."

"now?" langdon managed. "it's after midnight."

"am i correct that you were scheduled to meet with the curator of the louvre this evening?"

langdon felt a sudden surge of uneasiness. he and the revered curator jacques sauniere had been
slated to meet for drinks after langdon's lecture tonight, but sauniere had never shown up. "yes.
how did you know that?"

"we found your name in his daily planner."



"i trust nothing is wrong?"

the agent gave a dire sigh and slid a polaroid snapshot through the narrow opening in the door.

when langdon saw the photo, his entire body went rigid.

"this photo was taken less than an hour ago. inside the louvre."

as langdon stared at the bizarre image, his initial revulsion and shock

chapter 3

the crisp april air whipped through the open window of the citroen zx as it skimmed south past
the opera house and crossed place vendome. in the passenger seat, robert langdon felt the city
tear past him as he tried to clear his thoughts. his quick shower and shave had left him looking
reasonably presentable but had done little to ease his anxiety. the frightening image of the
curator's body remained locked in his mind.

jacques sauniere is dead.

langdon could not help but feel a deep sense of loss at the curator's death. despite sauniere's
reputation for being reclusive, his recognition for dedication to the arts made him an easy man to
revere. his books on the secret codes hidden in the paintings of poussin and teniers were some of
langdon's favorite classroom texts. tonight's meeting had been one langdon was very much
looking forward to, and he was disappointed when the curator had not shown.

langdon turned and looked out the window, forcing the picture from his mind.

outside, the city was just now winding down — street vendors wheeling carts of candied amandes,
waiters carrying bags of garbage to the curb, a pair of late night lovers cuddling to stay warm in a



breeze scented with jasmine blossom. the citroen navigated the chaos with authority, its dissonant
two-tone siren parting the traffic like a knife.

but finished the call as he arrived. he motioned for langdon to enter.



"i am bezu fache," he announced as langdon pushed through the revolving door. "captain of the
central directorate judicial police." his tone was fitting — a guttural rumble... like a gathering
storm.

langdon held out his hand to shake. "robert langdon."

fache's enormous palm wrapped around langdon's with crushing force.

"i saw the photo," langdon said. "your agent said jacques sauniere himself did — "

"mr. langdon," fache's ebony eyes locked on. "what you see in the photo is only the beginning of
what sauniere did."



chapter 4

captain bezu fache carried himself like an angry ox, with his wide shoulders thrown back and his
chin tucked hard into his chest. his dark hair was slicked back with oil, accentuating an arrow-like
widow's peak that divided his jutting brow and preceded him like the prow of a battleship. as he
advanced, his dark eyes seemed to scorch the earth bef

a cold and crypt-like atmosphere.

"and the museum's regular security staff?" langdon asked.

"en quarantaine, " fache replied, sounding as if langdon were questioning the integrity of fache's
team. "obviously, someone gained entry tonight who should not have. all louvre night wardens
are in the sully wing being questioned. my own agents have taken over museum security for the
evening."

langdon nodded, moving quickly to keep pace with fache.

"how well did you know jacques sauniere?" the captain asked.

"actually, not at all. we'd never met."

fache looked surprised. "your first meeting was to be tonight?"

"yes. we'd planned to meet at the american university reception following my lecture, but he
never showed up."

fache scribbled some notes in a little book. as they walked, langdon caught a glimpse of the
louvre's lesser-known pyramid — la pyramide inversee — a huge inverted skylight that hung from
the ceiling like a stalactite in an adjoining section of the entres

d," langdon replied as they entered the tunnel. "his
secretary contacted me a few weeks ago via e-mail. she said the curator had heard i would be
lecturing in paris this month and wanted to discuss something with me while i was here."



"discuss what?"

"i don't know. art, i imagine. we share similar interests."

fache looked skeptical. "you have no idea what your meeting was about?"

langdon did not. he'd been curious at the time but had not felt comfortable demanding specifics.
the venerated jacques sauniere had a renowned penchant for privacy and granted very few
meetings; langdon was grateful simply for the opportunity to meet him.

"mr. langdon, can you at least guess what our murder victim might have wanted to discuss with
you on the night he was killed? it might be helpful."

the pointedness of the question made langdon uncomfortable. "i really can't imagine. i didn't ask.
i felt honored to have been contacted at all. i'm an admirer of mr. sauniere's work. i use his texts
often in my classes."

the idiom apparently didn't translate. "i was looking forward to learning his thoughts on the topic."

"i see. and what is the topic?"

langdon hesitated, uncertain exactly how to put it. "essentially, the manuscript is about the
iconography of goddess worship — the concept of female sanctity and the art and symbols
associated with it."

fache ran a meaty hand across his hair. "and sauniere was knowledgeable about this?"

"nobody more so."

"i see."



langdon sensed fache did not see at all. jacques sauniere was considered the premiere goddess
iconographer on earth. not only did sauniere have a personal passion for relics relating to fertility,
goddess cults, wicca, and the sacred feminine, but during his twenty-year tenure as curator,
sauniere had helped the louvre amass the largest collection of goddess art on earth — labrys axes
from the priestesses' oldest greek shrine in delphi, gold caducei wands, hundreds of tjet ankhs
resembling small standing angels, sistrum rattles used in ancient egypt

"perhaps jacques sauniere knew of your manuscript?" fache offered. "and he called the meeting
to offer his help on your book."

langdon shook his head. "actually, nobody yet knows about my manuscript. it's still in draft form,
and i haven't shown it to anyone except my editor."

fache fell silent.

langdon did not add the reason he hadn't yet shown the manuscript to anyone else. the three-
hundred-page draft — tentatively titled symbols of the lost sacred feminine — proposed some very
unconventional interpretations

o track manta ray migrations. langdon had never harbored delusions that a woman
like vittoria vetra could have been happy living with him on a college campus, but their encounter
in rome had unlocked in him a longing he never imagined he could feel. his lifelong affinity for
bachelorhood and the simple freedoms it allowed had been shaken somehow... replaced by an
unexpected emptiness that seemed to have grown over the past year.

they continued walking briskly, yet langdon still saw no corpse. "jacques sauniere went this
far?"

"mr. sauniere suffered a bullet wound to his stomach. he died very slowly. perhaps over fifteen or
twenty minutes. he was obviously a man of great personal strength."

langdon turned, appalled. "security took fifteen minutes to get here?"

"of course not. louvre security responded immediately to the alarm and found the grand gallery

but they could not see who it was. they shouted, bu

irty yards down the hall, a single spotlight on a portable pole stand
shone down on the floor, creating a stark island of white light in the dark crimson gallery. in the
center of the light, like an insect under a microscope, the corpse of the curator lay naked on the
parquet floor.

"you saw the photograph," fache said, "so this should be of no surprise."

langdon felt a deep chill as they approached the body. before him was one of the strangest images
he had ever seen.



the pallid corpse of jacques sauniere lay on the parquet floor exactly as it appeared in the
photograph. as langdon stood over the body and squinted in the harsh light, he reminded himself
to his amazement that sauniere had spent his last minutes of life arranging his own body in this
strange fashion.

sauniere looked remarkably fit for a man of his years... and all of his musculature was in plain
view. he had stripped off every shred of clothing, placed it neatly on the floor, and laid down on
his back in the center of the wide co

beauty.

"interesting." fache nodded toward the spread-eagle corpse. "and the positioning of the body?
what do you make of that?"

langdon shrugged. "the position simply reinforces the reference to the pentacle and sacred
feminine."

fache's expression clouded. "i beg your pardon?"

"replication. repeating a symbol is the simplest way to strengthen its meaning. jacques sauniere
positioned himself in the shape of a five-pointed star." if one pentacle is good, two is better.

fache's eyes followed the five points of sauniere's arms, legs, and head as he again ran a hand
across his slick hair. "interesting analysis." he paused. "and the nudity?" he grumbled as he spoke
the word, sounding repulsed by the sight of an aging male body. "why did he remove his
clothing?"

damned good question, langdon thought. he'd been wondering the same thing ever since he first
saw the pola

best guess was that a naked human form was yet another endorsement of
venus — the goddess of human sexuality. although modern culture had erased much of venus's
association with the male/female physical union, a sharp etymological eye could still spot a vestige
of venus's original meaning in the word "venereal." langdon decided not to go there.

"mr. fache, i obviously can't tell you why mr. sauniere drew that symbol on himself or placed
himself in this way, but i can tell you that a man like jacques sauniere would consider the pentacle
a sign of the female deity. the correlation between this symbol and the sacred feminine is widely
known by art historians and symbologists."

"fine. and the use of his own blood as ink?"

"obviously he had nothing else to write with."

fache was silent a moment. "actually, i believe he used blood such that the police would follow
certain forensic procedures."

"i'm sorry?"



"look at his left hand."

langdon's eyes traced the length of the curator's pale arm to his

chapter 8

langdon couldn't tear his eyes from the glowing purple text scrawled across the parquet floor.
jacques sauniere's final communication seemed as unlikely a departing message as any langdon
could imagine.



the message read:

o, draconian devil !

oh, lame saint!



although langdon had not the slightest idea what it meant, he did understand fache's instinct that
the pentacle had something to do with devil worship.

o, draconian devil!

sauniere had left a literal reference to the devil. equally as bizarre was the series of numbers. "part
of it looks like a numeric cipher. "

the delicate art of cajoler was a lost skill in modern law enforcement, one that required
exceptional poise under pressure. few men possessed the necessary sangfroid for this kind of
operation, but fache seemed born for it. his restraint and patience bordered on the robotic.

fache's sole emotion this evening seemed to be one of intense resolve, as if this arrest were
somehow personal to him. fache's briefing of his agents an hour ago had been unusually succinct
and assured. / know who murdered jacques sauniere, fache had said. you know what to do. no
mistakes tonight.

and so far, no mistakes had been made.

collet was not yet privy to the evidence that had cemented fache's certainty of their suspect's guilt,
but he knew better than to question the instincts of the bull. fache's intuition seemed almost
supernatural at times. god whispers in his ear, one agent had insisted after a particularly
impressive display of fache's sixth sense. collet had to admit, if there was a god, bezu fache

could not imagine what the relevance of all this was to sauniere's death.



"mathematician leonardo fibonacci created this succession of numbers in the thirteenth-century.
obviously there can be no coincidence that all of the numbers sauniere wrote on the floor belong
to fibonacci's famous sequence."

fache stared at the young woman for several moments. "fine, if there is no coincidence, would you
tell me why jacques sauniere chose to do this. what is he saying? what does this mean?"

she shrugged. "absolutely nothing. that's the point. it's a simplistic cryptographic joke. like
taking the words of a famous poem and shuffling them at random to see if anyone recognizes what
all the words have in common."

fache took a menacing step forward, placing his face only inches from sophie's. "i certainly hope
you have a much more satisfying explanation than that. "

did not finish the thought. instead, she pried the metallic disk from langdon' s hand and slid it back
into the pocket of his tweed coat. "the dot stays with you. at least for the moment."



langdon felt lost. "how the hell could fache actually believe i killed jacques sauniere!"

"he has some fairly persuasive reasons to suspect you." sophie's expression was grim. "there is a
piece of evidence here that you have not yet seen. fache has kept it carefully hidden from you."

langdon could only stare.

"do you recall the three lines of text that sauniere wrote on the floor?"

langdon nodded. the numbers and words were imprinted on langdon's mind.

langdon suggested sauniere would have accused his killer by name.

"why would sauniere write this?" langdon demanded, his confusion now giving way to anger.
"why would i want to kill jacques sauniere?"

"fache has yet to uncover a motive, but he has been recording his entire conversation with you
tonight in hopes you might reveal one."

langdon opened his mouth, but still no words came.

"he's fitted with a miniature microphone," sophie explained. "it's connected to a transmitter in his
pocket that radios the signal back to the command post."

find langdon. "but why do you think his message was for you?"

"the vitruvian man, " she said flatly. "that particular sketch has always been my favorite da vinci
work. tonight he used it to catch my attention."

"hold on. you're saying the curator knew your favorite piece of art?" she nodded. "i'm sorry. this
is all coming out of order. jacques sauniere and i..."

sophie's voice caught, and langdon heard a sudden melancholy there, a painful past, simmering
just below the surface. sophie and jacques sauniere apparently had some kind of special
relationship. langdon studied the beautiful young woman before him, well aware that aging men in
france often took young mistresses. even so, sophie neveu as a "kept woman" somehow didn't
seem to fit.

"we had a falling-out ten years ago," sophie said, her voice a whisper now. "we've barely spoken

she shook her head. "p.s. are my initials."

she looked away. "p.s. is the nickname he called me when i lived with him." she blushed. "it

langdon had no response.

"silly, i know," she said. "but it was years ago. when i was a little girl."

"you knew him when you were a little girl?"

"quite well," she said, her eyes welling now with emotion. "jacques sauniere was my
grandfather."

"where's langdon?" fache demanded, exhaling the last of a cigarette as he paced back into the
command post.

"still in the men's room, sir." lieutenant collet had been expecting the question.

fache grumbled, "taking his time, i see."

turning. fache was fighting the urge to go check on langdon. ideally, the subject of an observation

sophie wondered how long it would take fache to figure out she had not left the building. seeing
that langdon was clearly overwhelmed, sophie questioned whether she had done the right thing by
cornering him here in the men's room.

what else was i supposed to do ?

she pictured her grandfather's body, naked and spread-eagle on the floor. there was a time when
he had meant the world to her, yet tonight, sophie was surprised to feel almost no sadness for the



man. jacques sauniere was a stranger to her now. their relationship had evaporated in a single
instant one march night when she was twenty-two. ten years ago. sophie had come home a few
days early from graduate university in england and mistakenly witnessed her grandfather engaged
in something sophie was obviously not supposed to see. it was an image she barely could believe
to this day.

she had not called him. nor had she planned to. now, however, her skepticism had been deeply

the floor.

a code for her. of this, she was certain.

despite not understanding the meaning of his message, sophie was certain its cryptic nature was
additional proof that the words were intended for her. sophie's passion and aptitude for
cryptography were a product of growing up with jacques sauniere — a fanatic himself for codes,
word games, and puzzles. how many sundays did we spend doing the cryptograms and crosswords
in the newspaper?

at the age of twelve, sophie could finish the he monde crossword without any help, and her

fache was silent a moment. "i was not aware of this, and it seems neither was the director until a
coworker informed him, but apparently sophie neveu is jacques sauniere's granddaughter."

collet was speechless.

"the director said she never once mentioned sauniere to him, and he assumed it was because she
probably didn't want preferential treatment for having a famous grandfather."

no wonder she was upset by the pictures. collet could barely conceive of the unfortunate

with an unexpected jolt, langdon stopped short. eyes wide, he dug in his pocket and yanked out
the computer printout. he stared at the last line of sauniere's message.

he fixated on two letters.

p.s.

in that instant, langdon felt sauniere's puzzling mix of symbolism fall into stark focus. like a peal
of thunder, a career's worth of symbology and history came crashing down around him. everything
jacques sauniere had done tonight suddenly made perfect sense.

langdon's thoughts raced as he tried to assemble the implications of what this all meant. wheeling,
he stared back in the direction from which he had come.

he knew it didn't matter.

without hesitation, langdon broke into a sprint back toward the stairs.

message for me here." quickly striding the final few steps to the mona lisa, she illuminated the
floor directly in front of the painting. she waved the light back and forth across the bare parquet.

at that moment, langdon saw a faint purple glimmer on the protective glass before the mona lisa.

security warden claude grouard simmered with rage as he stood over his prostrate captive in front
of the mona lisa. this bastard killed jacques sauniere! sauniere had been like a well-loved father

grouard wanted nothing more than to pull the trigger and bury a bullet in robert langdon's back.
as senior warden, grouard was one of the few guards who actually carried a loaded weapon. he
reminded himself, however, that killing langdon would be a generous fate compared to the misery
about to be communicated by bezu fache and the french prison system.

she nodded. "as i told you, i saw the key a long time ago. he told me never to speak of it again."

langdon's eyes were still riveted on the embossed key. its high-tech tooling and age-old
symbolism exuded an eerie fusion of ancient and modern worlds.

"he told me the key opened a box where he kept many secrets."

langdon felt a chill to imagine what kind of secrets a man like jacques sauniere might keep. what
an ancient brotherhood was doing with a futuristic key, langdon had no idea. the priory existed
for the sole purpose of protecting a secret. a secret of incredible power. could this key have
something to do with it? the thought was overwhelming. "do you know what it opens?"

sophie looked disappointed. "i was hoping you knew."

langdon remained silent as he turned the cruciform in his hand, examining it.

more evident now.



"really? your grandfather gave you the key but failed to give you the account number?"

"i don't think he had time," sophie said. "he was murdered tonight."

her words sent the man staggering backward. "jacques sauniere is dead?" he demanded, his eyes
filling with horror. "but... how?!"

now it was sophie who reeled, numb with shock. "you knew my grandfather?"

banker andre vernet looked equally astounded, steadying himself by leaning on an end table.
"jacques and i were dear friends. when did this happen?"

"earlier this evening. inside the louvre."

vernet walked to a deep leather chair and sank into it. "i need to ask you both a very important
question." he glanced up at langdon and then back to sophie. "di

"what is it for?"

considering tonight's events, sophie knew the answer might have some interesting implications.
"it's a vault," she said. "for storing secret information."

langdon's eyes widened further.

sophie explained that creating models of da vinci's inventions was one of her grandfather's best-
loved hobbies. a talented craftsman who spent hours in his wood and metal shop, jacques sauniere
enjoyed imitating master craftsmen — faberge, assorted cloisonne artisans, and the less artistic, but
far more practical, leonardo da vinci.

even a cursory glance through da vinci's journals revealed why the luminary was as notorious for
his lack of follow-through as he was famous for his brilliance. da vinci had drawn up blueprints
for hundreds of inventions he had never built. one of jacques sauniere's favorite pastimes was
bringing da vinci's more obscure brainstorms to life — timepiece

"i saw some things i wasn't supposed to see ten years ago. we haven't spoken since." she paused.
"my grandfather was not only a ranking top member of the group... i believe he was the top
member."

langdon could not believe what she had just said. "grand master? but... there's no way you could
know that!"



"i'd rather not talk about it." sophie looked away, her expression as determined as it was pained.

langdon sat in stunned silence. jacques sauniere? grand master? despite the astonishing
repercussions if it were true, langdon had the eerie sensation it almost made perfect sense. after
all, previous priory grand masters had also been distinguished public figures with artistic souls.
proof of that fact had been uncovered years ago in paris's bibliotheque nationale in papers that
became known as les dossiers secrets.

why not jacques sauniere ?

langdon's incredulity intensified with the realization that he had been slated to meet sauniere
tonight. the priory grand master called a meeting with me. why? to make artistic small talk? it
suddenly seemed unlikely. after all, if langdon's instincts were correct, the grand master of the

simultaneously commanded her to find robert langdon.

you got that key and account number tonight, but it seems obvious that foul play was involved.
had i known the extent of your crimes, i would never have helped you leave the bank."

"i told you," sophie said, "we had nothing to do with my grandfather's death!"

vernet looked at langdon. "and yet the radio claims you are wanted not only for the murder of



jacques sauniere but for those of three other men as well?"

"what!" langdon was thunderstruck. three more murders? the coincidental number hit him
harder than the fact that he was the prime suspect. it seemed too unlikely to be a coincidence. the
three senechaux? langdon's eyes dropped to the rosewood box. if the senechaux were murdered,
sauniere had no options. he had to transfer the keystone to someone.

"the police can sort that out when i turn you in," vernet said. "i have gotten my bank involved too

you,
the word companion, in those days, literally meant spouse. "

langdon concurred with a nod.

sophie read the first line again. and the companion of the saviour is mary magdalene.

teabing flipped through the book and pointed out several other passages that, to sophie's surprise,
clearly suggested magdalene and jesus had a romantic relationship. as she read the passages,
sophie recalled an angry priest who had banged on her grandfather's door when she was a
schoolgirl.

"is this the home of jacques sauniere?" the priest had demanded, glaring down at young sophie
when she pulled open the door. "i want to talk to him about this editorial he wrote." the priest held
up a newspaper.

sophie summoned her grandfather, and the two men disappeared into his study and closed the
door. my grandfather wrote something in the paper? sophie immediately ran to the kitchen and
flipped through that morning's paper. she found her grandfather's name on an article on the second



page. she read it. sophie didn't under

ert," he said coldly. "you have not been honest with me."



chapter 62

"i'm being framed, leigh," langdon said, trying to stay calm. you know me. i wouldn't kill anyone.

teabing's tone did not soften. "robert, you're on television, for christ's sake. did you know you
were wanted by the authorities?"

"yes."

"then you abused my trust. i'm astonished you would put me at risk by coming here and asking me
to ramble on about the grail so you could hide out in my home."

"i didn't kill anyone."

"jacques sauniere is dead, and the police say you did it." teabing looked saddened. "such a
contributor to the arts..."

"sir?" the manservant had appeared now, standing behind teabing in the study doorway, his arms
crossed. "shall i show them out?"

"allow me." teabing hobbled across the study, unlocked a set of wide glass doors, and swung
them open onto a side lawn. "please find your car, and leave."

sophie did not move. "we have information about the clef de voute. the priory keystone. "

teabing stared at h

closed.

now, as he huddled in the shadows, silas peered through the glass. the keystone is somewhere
inside the house. silas could feel it.

staying in the shadows, he inched closer to the glass, eager to hear what was being said. he would
give them five minutes. if they did not reveal where they had placed the keystone, silas would
have to enter and persuade them with force.



inside the study, langdon could sense their host's bewilderment.



"grand master?" teabing choked, eyeing sophie. "jacques sauniere?"

sophie nodded, seeing the shock in his eyes.

"but you could not possibly know that!"

"jacques sauniere was my grandfather."

teabing staggered back on his crutches, shooting a glance at langdon, who nodded. teabing
turned back to sophie. "miss neveu, i am speechless. if this is true, then i am truly sorry for your
loss. i should admit, for my research, i have kept lists of men in paris whom i thought might be
good candidates for involvement in the priory. jacques sauniere was on that list

 but this explains a lot thanks."

"robert—"

but langdon was gone.

faukman hung up the phone, shaking his head in disbelief authors, he thought. even the sane ones
are nuts.



inside the range rover, leigh teabing let out a guffaw. "robert, you're saying you wrote a
manuscript that delves into a secret society, and your editor sent a copy to that secret society?"

langdon slumped. "evidently."

"a cruel coincidence, my friend."



coincidence has nothing to do with it, langdon knew. asking jacques sauniere to endorse a
manuscript on goddess worship was as obvious as asking tiger woods to endorse a book on golf.
moreover, it was virtually guaranteed that any book on goddess worship would have to mention the
priory of sion.

"here's the million-dollar question," teabing said, still chuckling. "was your position on the priory
favorable or unfavorable?"

langdon could hear teabing's true meaning loud and clear. many historians questioned why the
priory was still keeping the sangreal documents hidden.

strange text.








t&%&v7c0dm&



after several seconds, he began to feel the initial frustration resurfacing. "leigh, i just can't seem to
place it. "

from where sophie was seated across the table, she could not yet see the text, but langdon's
inability to immediately identify the language surprised her. my grandfather spoke a language so
obscure that even a symbologist can't identify it? she quickly realized she should not find this
surprising. this would not be the first secret jacques sauniere had kept from his granddaughter.



opposite sophie, leigh teabing felt ready to burst. eager for his chance to see the text, he
quivered with excitement, leaning in, trying to see around langdon, who was still hunched over the
box.

"i don't know," langdon whispered intently. "my first guess is a semitic, but now i'm not so sure.
most primary semitics include nekkudot. this has none."

"probably ancient," teabing offered.

"nekkudot?" sophie inquired.

teabing never took his eyes from the box.

he uneasy sense right now that this poem before them contained
information they still had not seen.

there is more there, she told herself. ingeniously hidden... but present nonetheless.

also plaguing her thoughts was a fear that what they eventually found inside this cryptex would
not be as simple as "a map to the holy grail." despite teabing's and langdon's confidence that the
truth lay just within the marble cylinder, sophie had solved enough of her grandfather's treasure
hunts to know that jacques sauniere did not give up his secrets easily.



chapter 73

bourget airfield's night shift air traffic controller had been dozing before a blank radar screen
when the captain of the judicial police practically broke down his door.

"teabing's jet," bezu fache blared, marching into the small tower, "where did it go?"

the controller's initial response was a babbling, lame attempt to protect the privacy of their british
client — one of the airfield's most respected customers. it failed miserably.

"okay

 about?"

teabing looked distraught. "i don't know. i always thought... certainly, this must be the place. i
can't imagine he knows what he is talking about. it makes no sense ! "

"can i see the poem again?" langdon said.

sophie pulled the cryptex from her pocket and carefully handed it to him.

langdon unwrapped the vellum, holding the cryptex in his hand while he examined the poem.
"yes, the poem definitely references a tomb. not an effigy."

"could the poem be wrong?" teabing asked. "could jacques sauniere have made the same mistake
i just did?"

langdon considered it and shook his head. "leigh, you said it yourself. this church was built by
templars, the military arm of the priory. something tells me the grand master of the priory would
have a pretty good idea if there were knights buried here."

teabing looked flabbergasted. "but this place is perfect." he wheeled back toward the knights.
"we must be missing something!"



entering the annex, the altar boy was surprised to find it deserted. "fa

sophie was speechless. captain fache had apparently requested the london police dispatcher alert
him if sophie called in.

"listen," fache said, speaking to her in terse french. "i made a terrible mistake tonight. robert
langdon is innocent. all charges against him have been dropped. even so, both of you are in
danger. you need to come in."

sophie's jaw fell slack. she had no idea how to respond. fache was not a man who apologized for
anything.

"you did not tell me," fache continued, "that jacques sauniere was your grandfather. i fully intend
to overlook your insubordination last night on account of the emotional stress you must be under.
at the moment, however, you and langdon need to go to the nearest london police headquarters
for refuge."

he knows i'm in london? what else does fache know? sophie heard what sounded like drilling or
machinery in the background. she also heard an odd clicking on the line. "are you tracing this call,
captain?"

fache's voice was firm now. "you and i need to coop

chapter 90

high in the hayloft at chateau villette, collet stared at the computer monitor in amazement. "this
system is eavesdropping on all these locations?"

"yes," the agent said. "it looks like data has been collected for over a year now."

collet read the list again, speechless.

colbert sostaque— chairman of the conseil constitutionnel

jean chaffee— curator, musee du jeu de paume

edouard desrochers— senior archivist, mitterrand library

jacques sauniere— curator, musee du louvre

michel breton— head of das (french intelligence)
the agent pointed to the screen. "number four is of obvious concern."

collet nodded blankly. he had noticed it immediately. jacques sauniere was being bugged. he
looked at the rest of the list again. how could anyone possibly manage to bug these prominent
people? "have you heard any of the audio files?"

"a few. here's one of the most recent." the agent clicked a few computer keys. the speakers
crackled to life. "c

ed for the mouse. "who said anything about a catholic pope?" he clicked on the
"pope" hyperlink, and the complete sentence appeared.

sir isaac newton's burial, attended by kings and nobles, was presided

over by alexander pope, friend and colleague, who gave a stirring

eulogy before sprinkling dirt on the tomb.



langdon looked at sophie. "we had the correct pope on our second hit. alexander." he paused.
"a.pope."

in london lies a knight a. pope interred.

sophie stood up, looking stunned.

jacques sauniere, the master of double-entendres, had proven once again that he was a
frighteningly clever man.



chapter 96

silas awoke with a start.

he had no idea what had awoken him or how long he had been asleep. was i dreaming? sitting up
now on his straw mat, he listened to the quiet breathing of the opus dei residence hall, the stillness
textured only by the soft murmurs of someone praying aloud in a room below him. these were



familiar sounds and should have comforted him.

and yet he felt a sudde

ory's plans to unveil the truth about 'the
rose' and her fertile womb was linked directly to the position of planets — orbs."

langdon nodded, feeling the first faint wisps of possibility materializing. even so, his intuition told
him astronomy was not the key. the grand master's previous solutions had all possessed an
eloquent, symbolic significance — the mona lisa, madonna of the rocks, sofia. this eloquence
was definitely lacking in the concept of planetary orbs and the zodiac. thus far, jacques sauniere
had proven himself a meticulous code writer, and langdon had to believe that his final



password — those five letters that unlocked the priory's ultimate secret — would prove to be not only
symbolically fitting but also crystal clear. if this solution were anything like the others, it would be
painfully obvious once it dawned.

"look!" sophie gasped, jarring his thoughts as she grabbed his arm. from the fear in her touch
langdon sensed someone must be approaching, but when he turned to he

t to release the truth after all.
that's why the millennium passed without any revelation, why nothing happened as we entered the
end of days."

langdon drew a breath, about to protest.

"the priory," teabing continued, "was given a sacred charge to share the truth. to release the
sangreal documents when the end of days arrived. for centuries, men like da vinci, botticelli,
and newton risked everything to protect the documents and carry out that charge. and now, at the
ultimate moment of truth, jacques sauniere changed his mind. the man honored with the greatest
responsibility in christian history eschewed his duty. he decided the time was not right." teabing
turned to sophie. "he failed the grail. he failed the priory. and he failed the memory of all the
generations that had worked to make that moment possible."

"you?" sophie declared, glancing up now, her green eyes boring into him with rage and
realization. "you are the one responsible for my grandfather's murder?"

teabing scoffed. "your grandfat

ng out from behind the
bud-filled branches as if to remind langdon that the fruit of knowledge was growing just beyond
his reach.



across the room, sir leigh teabing watched with confidence as langdon gazed out the window as
if under a spell.

exactly as i hoped, teabing thought. he will come around.

for some time now, teabing had suspected langdon might hold the key to the grail. it was no
coincidence that teabing launched his plan into action on the same night langdon was scheduled
to meet jacques sauniere. listening in on the curator, teabing was certain the man's eagerness to
meet privately with langdon could mean only one thing. langdon' s mysterious manuscript has
touched a nerve with the priory.

langdon has stumbled onto a truth, and sauniere fears its release. teabing felt certain the grand
master was summoning langdon to silence him.

the truth has been silenced long enough!

teabing knew he had to act quickly. silas's attack would accomplish two goals. it would prevent
sauniere from pers

adorned in masters' loving art, she lies.

she rests at last beneath the starry skies.



when she finished, she was still for several seconds, until a knowing smile crossed her lips. "aah,
jacques."

langdon watched her expectantly. "you understand this?"

"as you have witnessed on the chapel floor, mr. langdon, there are many ways to see simple
things."

langdon strained to understand. everything about jacques sauniere seemed to have double
meanings, and yet langdon could see no further.

marie gave a tired yawn. "mr. langdon, i will make a confession to you. i have never officially
been privy to the present location of the grail. but, of course, i was married to a person of
enormous influence... and my women's intuition is strong." langdon started to speak but marie
continued. "i am sorry that after all your hard work, you will be leaving rosslyn without any real
answers. and yet, something tells me you will
