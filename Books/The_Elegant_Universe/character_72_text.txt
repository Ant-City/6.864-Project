to quantum effects, the ice cubes in george's and gracie's drinks frantically rattle around as they too
suffer  from  quantum  claustrophobia. although  the  h-bar  is  a  fantasyland—in  reality, h  is  terribly
small—precisely this kind of quantum claustrophobia is a pervasive feature of the microscopic realm.
the  motion  of  microscopic  particles  becomes  increasingly  wild  when  they  are  examined  and
confined to ever smaller regions of space.

the uncertainty principle also gives rise to a striking effect known as quantum tunneling. if you
fire  a  plastic  pellet  against  a  ten-foot-thick  concrete  wall,  classical  physics  confirms  what  your
instincts tell you will happen: the pellet will bounce back at you. the reason is that the pellet simply
does not have enough energy to penetrate such a formidable obstacle. but at the level of fundamental
particles, quantum mechanics shows unequivocally that the wave functions—that is, the probability
waves—o

f the particles making up the pellet all have a tiny piece that spills out through the wall.
this means that there is a small—but not zero—chance that the pellet actually can penetrate the wall
and emerge on the other side. how can this be? the reason comes down, once again, to heisenberg's
uncertainty principle.

the mathematics of quantum mechanics shows that the greater the energy barrier, the lower the
probability  that  this  creative  microscopic  accounting  will  actually  occur.  but  for  microscopic
particles  facing  a  concrete  slab,  they  can  and  sometimes  do  borrow  enough  energy  to  do  what  is
impossible  from  the  standpoint  of  classical  physics—momentarily  penetrate  and  tunnel  through  a
region  that  they  do  not  initially  have  enough  energy  to  enter.  as

require ever longer durations to carry them out. roughly speaking, this means
that the energy a particle has can wildly fluctuate so long as this fluctuation is over a short enough
time scale. so, just as the accounting system of the airline "allows" you to "borrow" the money for a
plane  ticket  provided  you  pay  it  back  quickly  enough,  quantum  mechanics  allows  a  particle  to
"borrow"  energy  so  long  as  it  can  relinquish  it  within  a  time  frame  determined  by  heisenberg's
uncertainty principle.

tunneling is commonplace. but the probability rules of quantum mechanics—and, in particular, the
actual smallness of h in the real world—show that if you walked into a solid wall every second, you
would  have  to  wait  longer  than  the  current  age  of  the  universe  to  have  a  good  chance  of  passing
through it on one of your attempts. with eternal patience (and longevity), though, you could—sooner
or later—emerge on the other side.

the heart of quantum mechanics

when  heisenberg  discovered  the  uncertainty  principle,  physics  turned  a  sharp  corner,  never  to
retrace  its  steps.  probabilities,  wave  functions,  interference,  and  quanta  all  involve  radically  new
ways of seeing reality. nevertheless, a die-hard "classical" physicist might still have hung on to a
thread of hope that when all was said and done these departures would add up to a framework not too
distant from old ways of thinking. but the uncertainty principle cleanly and definitively undercut any
attempt to cling to the past.

the uncertainty principle tells us that the universe is a frenetic place when examined on smaller

and  smaller  distances  and  shorter  and  shorter  time  scales.  we  saw  some  evidence  of  this  in  our
attempt, described in the preceding chapter, to pinpoint the location of elementary particles such as
electrons: by shining light of ever higher frequency on electrons, we measure their position with ever
greater precis

ntly  reacting  to  being  confined  in  a  small  box  by  rattling  around  at  high  speed  takes  us  a  bit
closer to the truth. even without "direct hits" from an experimenter's disruptive photon, the electron's
velocity severely and unpredictably changes from one moment to the next. but even this example does
not fully reveal the stunning microscopic features of nature entailed by heisenberg's discovery. even
in the most quiescent setting imaginable, such as an empty region of space, the uncertainty principle
tells  us  that  from  a  microscopic  vantage  point  there  is  a  tremendous  amount  of  activity. and  this
activity gets increasingly agitated on ever smaller distance and time scales.

quantum accounting is essential to understand this. we saw in the preceding chapter that just as
you might temporarily borrow money to overcome an important financial obstacle, a particle such as
an electron can temporarily borrow energy to overcome a literal physical barrier. this is true. but

ey,  the  larger  the  loan  he  seeks.  borrow  and  return,  borrow  and
return—over and over again with unflagging intensity he takes in money only to give it back in short
order.  like  stock  prices  on  a  wild,  roller-coaster  day  on  wall  street,  the  amount  of  money  the
compulsive borrower possesses at any given moment goes through extreme fluctuations, but when all
is said and done, an accounting of his finances shows that he is no better off than when he began.

heisenberg's uncertainty principle asserts that a similar frantic shifting back and forth of energy
and momentum is occurring perpetually in the universe on microscopic distance and time intervals.
even in an empty region of space—inside an empty box, for example—the uncertainty principle says
that the energy and momentum are uncertain: they fluctuate between extremes that get larger as the
size of the box and the time scale over which it is examined get smaller and smaller. it's as if the

magnetic-field  oscillations,  weak  and  strong  force-field  fluctuations—
quantum-mechanical  uncertainty  tells  us  the  universe  is  a  teeming,  chaotic,  frenzied  arena  on

microscopic  scales. as  feynman  once  jested,  "created  and  annihilated,  created  and  annihilated—
what a waste of time."2 since the borrowing and repaying on average cancel each other out, an empty
region  of  space  looks  calm  and  placid  when  examined  with  all  but  microscopic  precision.  the
uncertainty principle, however, reveals that macroscopic averaging obscures a wealth of microscopic
activity.3 as we will see shortly, this frenzy is the obstacle to merging general relativity and quantum
mechanics.

quantum field theory

over  the  course  of  the  1930s  and  1940s  theoretical  physicists,  led  by  the  likes  of  paul  dirac,
wolfgang pauli, julian schwinger, freeman dyson, sin-itiro tomonaga, and feynman, to name a few,
struggled  relentlessly  to  find  a  mathematical  formalism  capable  of

 image of space to persist all the way to arbitrarily small length
scales.  but  quantum  mechanics  changes  this  conclusion  radically. everything  is  subject  to  the
quantum  fluctuations  inherent  in  the  uncertainty  principle—even  the  gravitational  field.  although
classical reasoning implies that empty space has zero gravitational field, quantum mechanics shows
that on average it is zero, but that its actual value undulates up and down due to quantum fluctuations.
moreover, the uncertainty principle tells us that the size of the undulations of the gravitational field
gets  larger  as  we  focus  our  attention  on  smaller  regions  of  space.  quantum  mechanics  shows  that
nothing likes to be cornered; narrowing the spatial focus leads to ever larger undulations.

as  gravitational  fields  are  reflected  by  curvature,  these  quantum  fluctuations  manifest
themselves as increasingly violent distortions of the surrounding space. we see the glimmers of such
distortions emerging in the

ons of left and right, back and forth, up and down
(and even of before and after) lose their meaning. it is on such short distance scales that we encounter
the fundamental incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics. the notion of a
smooth  spatial  geometry,  the  central  principle  of  general  relativity,  is  destroyed  by  the  violent
fluctuations of the quantum world on short distance scales. on ultramicroscopic scales, the central
feature of quantum mechanics—the uncertainty principle—is in direct conflict with the central feature
of general relativity—the smooth geometrical model of space (and of spacetime).

figure  5.1  by  sequentially  magnifying  a  region  of  space,  its  ultramicroscopic  properties  can  be
probed.  attempts  to  merge  general  relativity  and  quantum  mechanics  run  up  against  the  violent
quantum foam emerging at the highest level of magnification.

in practice, this conflict rears its head in a very concrete manner. calculations that m

 or "typical" energy scale (and hence mass scale) of string
theory is the planck scale.

this raises a crucial question directly related to the goal of reproducing the particle properties
in tables 1.1 and 1.2: if the "natural" energy scale of string theory is some ten billion billion times
that of a proton, how can it possibly account for the far-lighter particles—electrons, quarks, photons,
and so on—making up the world around us?

the answer, once again, comes from quantum mechanics. the uncertainty principle ensures that
nothing is ever perfectly at rest. all objects undergo quantum jitter, for if they didn't we would know
where  they  were  and  how  fast  they  were  moving  with  complete  precision,  in  violation  of
heisenberg's dictum. this holds true for the loops in string theory as well; no matter how placid a
string appears it will always experience some amount of quantum vibration. the remarkable thing, as
originally worked out in the 1970s, is that there can be energy cancellations bet

too big to have any sensitivity to structure on atomic scales. this is why
particle  accelerators  use  protons  or  electrons  as  probes,  since  their  small  size  makes  them  much
better suited to the task. on subatomic scales, where quantum concepts replace classical reasoning,
the  most  appropriate  measure  of  a  particle's  probing  sensitivity  is  its  quantum  wavelength,  which
indicates the window of uncertainty in its position. this fact reflects our discussion of heisenberg's
uncertainty principle in chapter 4, in which we found that the margin of error incurred when using a
point  particle  as  a  probe  (we  focused  on  photon  probes  but  the  discussion  applies  to  all  other
particles) is about equal to the probe particle's quantum wave-length. in somewhat looser language,
the probing sensitivity of a point particle is smeared out by the jitteriness of quantum mechanics, in
much the same way that the precision of a surgeon's scalpel is compromised if he or she has hands

discussion it is easier to separate them in this manner. in fact, the ordinary vibrations will not play a
central part in our reasoning, and we will therefore include their effects only after we have finished
giving the gist of the argument.

here are the two essential observations. first, uniform vibrational excitations of a string have
energies  that  are inversely  proportional  to  the  radius  of  the  circular  dimension.  this  is  a  direct
consequence of the quantum-mechanical uncertainty principle: a smaller radius more strictly confines

a string and therefore, through quantum-mechanical claustrophobia, increases the amount of energy in
its motion. so, as the radius of the circular dimension decreases, the energy of motion of the string
necessarily  increases—the  hallmark  feature  of  an  inverse  proportionality.  second,  as  found  in  the
preceding  section,  the  winding  mode  energies  are directly—not  inversely—proportional  to  the
radius. remember, this is because th

nition uses strings that are
wound. we see that the extended nature of the fundamental probe is responsible for there being two
natural operational definitions of distance in string theory. in a point-particle theory, for which there

is no notion of winding, there would be only one such definition.

how do the results of each procedure differ? the answer found by brandenberger and vafa is as
surprising as it is subtle. the rough idea underlying the result can be understood by appealing to the
uncertainty principle. unwound strings can move around freely and probe the full circumference of
the circle, a length proportional to r. by the uncertainty principle, their energies are proportional to
1/r (recall from chapter 6 the inverse relation between the energy of a probe and the distances to
which  it  is  sensitive).  on  the  other  hand,  we  have  seen  that  wound  strings  have  minimum  energy
proportional  to r;  as  probes  of  distances  the  uncertainty  principle  tells  us  that  they  are  the

athematical formula can be associated with
the  schematic  portrayal  of  figure  12.3—a  formula  that  expresses  the  influence  that  each  incoming
string has on the resulting motion of the other. (the details of the formula differ among the five string
theories,  but  for  the  time  being  we  will  ignore  such  subtle  features.)  if  it  weren't  for  quantum
mechanics, this formula would be the end of the story of how the strings interact. but the microscopic
frenzy dictated by the uncertainty principle implies that string/antistring pairs (two strings executing
opposite  vibrational  patterns)  can  momentarily  erupt  into  existence,  borrowing  energy  from  the
universe,  so  long  as  they  annihilate  one  another  with  sufficient  haste,  thereby  repaying  the  energy
loan. such pairs of strings, born of the quantum frenzy but which live on borrowed energy and hence
must shortly recombine into a single loop, are known as virtual string pairs. and even though it is
only  momentary,  t

inclusion of quantum mechanics modifies this conclusion in a profound way. even though he was not
in possession of a quantum-mechanical version of general relativity, hawking was able to finesse a
partial union of these two theoretical tools that yielded some limited yet reliable results. and the most
important result he found was that black holes do emit radiation, quantum mechanically.

the calculations are long and arduous, but hawking's basic idea is simple. we have seen that
the uncertainty principle ensures that even the vacuum of empty space is a teeming, roiling frenzy of
virtual particles momentarily erupting into existence and subsequently annihilating one another. this
jittery quantum behavior also occurs in the region of space just outside the event horizon of a black
hole. hawking realized, however, that the gravitational might of the black hole can inject energy into
a pair of virtual photons, say, that tears them just far enough apart so that one gets sucked into the
hole. with it

3. in case you are still perplexed about how anything at all can happen within a region of space
that is empty, it is important to realize that the uncertainty principle places a limit on how "empty" a
region  of  space  can  actually  be;  it  modifies  what  we  mean  by  empty  space.  for  example,  when
applied  to  wave  disturbances  in  a  field  (such  as  electromagnetic  waves  traveling  in  the
electromagnetic  field)  the  uncertainty  principle  shows  that  the  amplitude  of  a  wave  and  the  speed
with which its amplitude changes are subject to the same inverse relationship as are the position and
