--what can they be doing? brother, said my father.--i think, replied
my uncle toby,--taking, as i told you, his pipe from his mouth, and
striking the ashes out of it as he began his sentence;--i think, replied
he,--it would not be amiss, brother, if we rung the bell.

pray, what's all that racket over our heads, obadiah?--quoth my
father;--my brother and i can scarce hear ourselves speak.

sir, answered obadiah, making a bow towards his left shoulder,--my
mistress is taken very badly.--and where's susannah running down the
garden there, as if they were going to ravish her?--sir, she is running
the shortest cut into the town, replied obadiah, to fetch the old
midwife.--then saddle a horse, quoth my father, and do you go directly
for dr. slop, the man-midwife, with all our services,--and let him know
your mistre

it is very strange, says my father, addressing himself to my uncle toby,
as obadiah shut the door,--as there is so expert an operator as dr. slop
so near,--that my wife should persist to the very last in this obstinate
humour of hers, in trusting the life of my child, who has had one
misfortune already, to the ignorance of an old woman;--and not only the
life of my child, brother,--but her own life, and with it the lives of
all the children i might, peradventure, have begot out of her hereafter.

mayhap, brother, replied my uncle toby, my sister does it to save the
expence:--a

father could get an opportunity to be safely delivered of it:--and, at
this hour, it is a thing full as problematical as the subject of the
dissertation itself,--(considering the confusion and distresses of our
domestick misadventures, which are now coming thick one upon the back
of another) whether i shall be able to find a place for it in the third
volume or not.



chapter 1.xxxiii.

it is about an hour and a half's tolerable good reading since my uncle
toby rung the bell, when obadiah was ordered to saddle a horse, and go
for dr. slop, the man-midwife;--so that no one can say, with reason,
that i have not allowed obadiah time enough, poetically speaking, and
considering the emergency too, both to go and come;--though, morally and
truly speaking, the man perhaps has scarce had time to get on his boots.

if the hypercritick will go upon this; and is resolved after all to take
a pendulum, and measure the true distance betwixt the ringing of the
bell, and the rap at the door;--a

reach in the unity, or rather probability
of time;--i would remind him, that the idea of duration, and of its
simple modes, is got merely from the train and succession of our
ideas--and is the true scholastic pendulum,--and by which, as a scholar,
i will be tried in this matter,--abjuring and detesting the jurisdiction
of all other pendulums whatever.

i would therefore desire him to consider that it is but poor eight miles
from shandy-hall to dr. slop, the man-midwife's house:--and that whilst
obadiah has been going those said miles and back, i have brought my
uncle toby from namur, quite across all flanders, into england:--that
i have had him ill upon my hands near four years;--and have since
travelled him and corporal trim in a chariot-and-four, a journey of near
two hundred miles down into yorkshire.--all which put together, must
have prepared the reader's imagination for the entrance of dr. slop upon
the stage,--as much, at least (i hope) as a dance, a song, or a concerto
between the act

if my hypercritick is intractable, alledging, that two minutes
and thirteen seconds are no more than two minutes and thirteen
seconds,--when i have said all i can about them; and that this plea,
though it might save me dramatically, will damn me biographically,
rendering my book from this very moment, a professed romance, which,
before, was a book apocryphal:--if i am thus pressed--i then put an
end to the whole objection and controversy about it all at once,--by
acquainting him, that obadiah had not got above threescore yards from
the stable-yard, before he met with dr. slop;--and indeed he gave a
dirty proof that he had met with him, and was within an ace of giving a
tragical one too.

imagine to yourself;--but this had better begin a new chapter.



chapter 1.xxxiv.

imagine to yourself a little squat, uncourtly figure of a doctor slop,
of about four feet and a half perpendicular height, with a breadth of
back, and a sesquipedality of belly, which might have done honour to a
serj

ish you
would;--you must know, may as certainly be caricatured, and conveyed to
the mind by three strokes as three hundred.

imagine such a one,--for such, i say, were the outlines of dr. slop's
figure, coming slowly along, foot by foot, waddling thro' the dirt upon
the vertebrae of a little diminutive pony, of a pretty colour--but of
strength,--alack!--scarce able to have made an amble of it, under such
a fardel, had the roads been in an ambling condition.--they were
not.--imagine to yourself, obadiah mounted upon a strong monster of
a coach-horse, pricked into a full gallop, and making all practicable
speed the adverse way.

pray, sir, let me interest you a moment in this description.

had dr. slop beheld obadiah a mile off, posting in a narrow lane
directly towards him, at that monstrous rate,--splashing and plunging
like a devil thro' thick and thin, as he approached, would not such a
phaenomenon, with such a vortex of mud and water moving along with it,
round its axis,--have been a subje

ct of juster apprehension to dr. slop
in his situation, than the worst of whiston's comets?--to say nothing of
the nucleus; that is, of obadiah and the coach-horse.--in my idea, the
vortex alone of 'em was enough to have involved and carried, if not the
doctor, at least the doctor's pony, quite away with it. what then do you
think must the terror and hydrophobia of dr. slop have been, when you
read (which you are just going to do) that he was advancing thus warily
along towards shandy-hall, and had approached to within sixty yards of
it, and within five yards of a sudden turn, made by an acute angle
of the garden-wall,--and in the dirt

iest part of a dirty
lane,--when obadiah and his coach-horse turned the corner, rapid,
furious,--pop,--full upon him!--nothing, i think, in nature, can be
supposed more terrible than such a rencounter,--so imprompt! so ill
prepared to stand the shock of it as dr. slop was.

what could dr. slop do?--he crossed himself + --pugh!--but the doctor,
sir, was a papist.--no matter; he had better have kept hold of the
pummel.--he had so;--nay, as it happened, he had better have done
nothing at all; for in crossing himself he let go his whip,--
 
 ___________________________
 
and in
attempting to save his whip betwixt his knee and his saddle's skirt, as
it slipped, he lost his stirrup,--in losing which he lost his seat;--and
in the multitude of all these losses (which, by the bye, shews what
little advantage there is in crossing) the unfortunate doctor lost his
presence of mind. so that without waiting for obadiah's onset, he left
his pony to its destiny, tumbling off it diagonally, something in the
stile and manner of a pack of wool, and without any other consequence
from the fall, save that of being left (as it would have been) with the
broadest part of him sunk about twelve inches deep in the mire.

obadiah pull'd off his cap twice to dr. slop;--once as he was
falling,--and then again when he saw him seated.--ill-timed
complaisance;--had not the fellow better have stopped his horse, and
got off and he
 
 ___________________________
 
lp'd him?--sir, he did all that his situation would
allow;--but the momentum of the coach-horse was so great, that obadiah
could not do it all at once; he rode in a circle three times round dr.
slop, before he could fully accomplish it any how;--and at the last,
when he did stop his beast, 'twas done with such an explosion of mud,
that obadiah had better have been a league off. in short, never was a
dr. slop so beluted, and so transubstantiated, since that affair came
into fashion.



chapter 1.xxxv.

when dr. slop entered the back parlour, where my father and my uncle
toby were discoursing upon the nature of women,--it was hard to
determine whether dr. slop's figure, or dr. slop's presence, occasioned
more surprize to them; for as the accident happened so near the house,
as not to make it worth while for obadiah to remount him,--oba
 
 ___________________________
 
diah had
led him in as he was, unwiped, unappointed, unannealed, with all his
stains and blotches on him.--he stood like hamlet's ghost, motionless
and speechless, for a full minute and a half at the parlour-door
(obadiah still holding his hand) with all the majesty of mud. his hinder
parts, upon which he had received his fall, totally besmeared,--and in
every other part of him, blotched over in such a manner with obadiah's
explosion, that you would have sworn (without mental reservation) that
every grain of it had taken effect.

here was a fair opportunity for my uncle toby to have triumphed over
my father in his turn;--for no mortal, who had beheld dr. slop in that
pickle, could have dissented from so much, at least, of my uncle toby's
opinion, 'that mayhap his sister might not care to let such a dr. slop
come so near her....' but it was the argumentum ad hominem; and if my
uncle toby was not very expert at it
 
 ___________________________
 
well as yourself.

for my own part, i am eternally paying him compliments of this kind, and
do all that lies in my power to keep his imagination as busy as my own.

'tis his turn now;--i have given an ample description of dr. slop's
sad overthrow, and of his sad appearance in the back-parlour;--his
imagination must now go on with it for a while.

let the reader imagine then, that dr. slop has told his tale--and in
what words, and with what aggravations, his fancy chooses;--let him
suppose, that obadiah has told his tale also, and with such rueful looks
of affected concern, as he thinks best will contrast the two figures as
they stand by each other.--let him imagine, that my father has
stepped up stairs to see my mother.--and, to conclude this work of
imagination,--let him imagine the doctor washed,--rubbed down, and
condoled,--felicitated,--got into a pair of obadiah's pumps, stepping
forwards towards the door, upon the very point of entering upon action.

truce!--truce, good dr. slop!--stay

chapter 1.xxxvii.

your sudden and unexpected arrival, quoth my uncle toby, addressing
himself to dr. slop, (all three of them sitting down to the fire
together, as my uncle toby began to speak)--instantly brought the great
stevinus into my head, who, you must know, is a favourite author with
me.--then, added my fat

will lay twenty guineas to a single crown-piece (which will serve to
give away to obadiah when he gets back) that this same stevinus was some
engineer or other--or has wrote something or other, either directly or
indirectly, upon the science of fortification.

he has so,--replied my uncle toby.--i knew it, said my father, though,
for the soul of me, i cannot see what kind of connection there can
be betwixt dr. slop's sudden coming, and a discourse upon
fortification;--yet i fear'd it.--talk of what we will, brother,--or let
the occasion be never so foreign or unfit for the subject,-
 
 ___________________________
 
 smiled.

i cannot conceive how it is possible, quoth my uncle toby, for such a
thing as a sermon to have got into my stevinus.

i think 'tis a sermon, replied trim:--but if it please your honours,
as it is a fair hand, i will read you a page;--for trim, you must know,
loved to hear himself read almost as well as talk.

i have ever a strong propensity, said my father, to look into things
which cross my way, by such strange fatalities as these;--and as we
have nothing better to do, at least till obadiah gets back, i shall be
obliged to you, brother, if dr. slop has no objection to it, to order
the corporal to give us a page or two of it,--if he is as able to do it,
as he seems willing. an' please your honour, quoth trim, i officiated
two whole campaigns, in flanders, as clerk to the chaplain of the
regiment.--he can read it, quoth my uncle toby, as well as i can.--trim,
i assure you, was the best scholar in my company, and should have had
the next halberd, but for the poor fellow's misfortune.

orry fortifications, trim.--o! very poor work, answered trim,
to what your honour and i make of it.--the character of this last man,
said dr. slop, interrupting trim, is more detestable than all the rest;
and seems to have been taken from some pettifogging lawyer amongst
you:--amongst us, a man's conscience could not possibly continue so long
blinded,--three times in a year, at least, he must go to confession.
will that restore it to sight? quoth my uncle toby,--go on, trim, quoth
my father, or obadiah will have got back before thou has got to the
end of thy sermon.--'tis a very short one, replied trim.--i wish it was
longer, quoth my uncle toby, for i like it hugely.--trim went on.)

their ceremony of slow chicane;--scorns the doubtful workings of
secret plots and cautious trains to bring about his purpose:--see

slop, looking towards trim, with something more of contempt than the
corporal's honest heart deserved.--what do you know, friend, about this
battle you talk of?--i know, replied trim, that i never refused quarter
in my life to any man who cried out for it;--but to a woman or a child,
continued trim, before i would level my musket at them, i would loose
my life a thousand times.--here's a crown for thee, trim, to drink with
obadiah to-night, quoth my uncle toby, and i'll give obadiah another
too.--god bless your honour, replied trim,--i had rather these poor
women and children had it.--thou art an honest fellow, quoth my uncle
toby.--my father nodded his head, as much as to say--and so he is.--

but prithee, trim, said my father, make an end,--for i see thou hast but
a leaf or two left.

ghost;--which--as the country-people, and some others believe,--still
walks.

the second reason is, that, by laying open this story to the world,
i gain an opportunity of informing it,--that in case the character of
parson yorick, and this sample of his sermons, is liked,--there are now
in the possession of the shandy family, as many as will make a handsome
volume, at the world's service,--and much good may they do it.



chapter 1.xliii.

obadiah gained the two crowns without dispute;--for he came in jingling,
with all the instruments in the green baize bag we spoke of, flung
across his body, just as corporal trim went out of the room.

it is now proper, i think, quoth dr. slop, (clearing up his looks) as
we are in a condition to be of some service to mrs. shandy, to send up
stairs to know how she goes on.

i have ordered, answered my father, the old midwife to come down to us
upon the least difficulty;--for you must know, dr. slop, con

it,--our forefathers never looked farther.--my uncle toby instantly
withdrew his hand from off my father's knee, reclined his body gently
back in his chair, raised his head till he could just see the cornice of
the room, and then directing the buccinatory muscles along his cheeks,
and the orbicular muscles around his lips to do their duty--he whistled
lillabullero.



chapter 1.li.

whilst my uncle toby was whistling lillabullero to my father,--dr. slop
was stamping, and cursing and damning at obadiah at a most dreadful
rate,--it would have done your heart good, and cured you, sir, for
ever of the vile sin of swearing, to have heard him, i am determined
therefore to relate the whole affair to you.

when dr. slop's maid delivered the green baize bag with her master's
instruments in it, to obadiah, she very sensibly exhorted him to put his
head and one arm through the strings, and ride with it slung across his
body: so undoing the bow-knot, to lengthen the strings for him, without
any more ado
 
 ___________________________
 
, she helped him on with it. however, as this, in some
measure, unguarded the mouth of the bag, lest any thing should bolt out
in galloping back, at the speed obadiah threatened, they consulted to
take it off again: and in the great care and caution of their hearts,
they had taken the two strings and tied them close (pursing up the mouth
of the bag first) with half a dozen hard knots, each of which obadiah,
to make all safe, had twitched and drawn together with all the strength
of his body.

this answered all that obadiah and the maid intended; but was no remedy
against some evils which neither he or she foresaw. the instruments, it
seems, as tight as the bag was tied above, had so much room to play in
it, towards the bottom (the shape of the bag being conical) that obadiah
could not make a trot of it, but with such a terrible jingle, what with
the tire tete, forceps, and squirt, as would have be
 
 ___________________________
 
en enough, had hymen
been taking a jaunt that way, to have frightened him out of the country;
but when obadiah accelerated his motion, and from a plain trot assayed
to prick his coach-horse into a full gallop--by heaven! sir, the jingle
was incredible.

as obadiah had a wife and three children--the turpitude of fornication,
and the many other political ill consequences of this jingling, never
once entered his brain,--he had however his objection, which came home
to himself, and weighed with him, as it has oft-times done with the
greatest patriots.--'the poor fellow, sir, was not able to hear himself
whistle.'



chapter 1.lii.

as obadiah loved wind-music preferably to all the instrumental music he
carried with him,--he very considerately set his imagina

tion to work,
to contrive and to invent by what means he should put himself in a
condition of enjoying it.

in all distresses (except musical) where small cords are wanted, nothing
is so apt to enter a man's head as his hat-band:--the philosophy of this
is so near the surface--i scorn to enter into it.

as obadiah's was a mixed case--mark, sirs,--i say, a mixed case; for it
was obstetrical,--scrip-tical, squirtical, papistical--and as far as
the coach-horse was concerned in it,--caballistical--and only partly
musical;--obadiah made no scruple of availing himself of the first
expedient which offered; so taking hold of the bag and instruments, and
griping them hard together with one hand, and with the finger and thumb
of the other putting the end of the hat-band betwixt his teeth, and then
slipping his han

ne end to the other (as you would cord a trunk)
with such a multiplicity of round-abouts and intricate cross turns, with
a hard knot at every intersection or point where the strings met,--that
dr. slop must have had three fifths of job's patience at least to have
unloosed them.--i think in my conscience, that had nature been in one of
her nimble moods, and in humour for such a contest--and she and dr. slop
both fairly started together--there is no man living which had seen the
bag with all that obadiah had done to it,--and known likewise the great
speed the goddess can make when she thinks proper, who would have had
the least doubt remaining in his mind--which of the two would have
carried off the prize. my mother, madam, had been delivered sooner than
the green bag infallibly--at least by twenty knots.--sport of small
accidents, tristram shandy! that thou art, and ever will be! had that
trial been for thee, and it was fifty to one but it had,--thy affairs
had not been so depress'd--(at least

reat uncle mr. hammond shandy,--a
little man,--but of high fancy:--he rushed into the duke of monmouth's
affair:--nor, secondly, in this place, do i mean that particular species
of knots called bow-knots;--there is so little address, or skill, or
patience required in the unloosing them, that they are below my giving
any opinion at all about them.--but by the knots i am speaking of, may
it please your reverences to believe, that i mean good, honest, devilish
tight, hard knots, made bona fide, as obadiah made his;--in which there
is no quibbling provision made by the duplication and return of the
two ends of the strings thro' the annulus or noose made by the second
implication of them--to get them slipp'd and undone by.--i hope you
apprehend me.

in the case of these knots then, and of the several obstructions, which,
may it please your reverences, such knots cast in our way in getting
through life--every hasty man can whip out his pen-knife and cut through
them.--'tis wrong. believe me, sirs,

fellow! i shall never get the knots untied as long as i live.--my mother
gave a groan.--lend me your penknife--i must e'en cut the knots at

bone--curse the fellow--if there was not another man-midwife within
fifty miles--i am undone for this bout--i wish the scoundrel hang'd--i
wish he was shot--i wish all the devils in hell had him for a
blockhead--!

my father had a great respect for obadiah, and could not bear to hear
him disposed of in such a manner--he had moreover some little respect
for himself--and could as ill bear with the indignity offered to himself
in it.

had dr. slop cut any part about him, but his thumb--my father had pass'd
it by--his prudence had triumphed: as it was, he was determined to have
his revenge.

replied dr. slop.--so am not i, replied my uncle.--but he is cursed, and

--what the possibility was, dr. slop whispered very low to my father,
and then to my uncle toby.--there is no such danger, continued he, with
the head.--no, in truth quoth my father--but when your possibility has
taken place at the hip--you may as well take off the head too.

--it is morally impossible the reader should understand this--'tis
enough dr. slop understood it;--so taking the green baize bag in his
hand, with the help of obadiah's pumps, he tripp'd pretty nimbly, for
a man of his size, across the room to the door--and from the door was
shewn the way, by the good old midwife, to my mother's apartments.

at his watch, since dr. slop and obadiah arrived--and i know not how it

out of a pair of jack-boots, which obadiah told me your honour had left
off wearing.--by heaven! cried my father, springing out of his chair,
as he swore--i have not one appointment belonging to me, which i set
so much store by as i do by these jack-boots--they were our great
grandfather's brother toby--they were hereditary. then i fear, quoth my

obadiah, and looking wistfully in my uncle toby's face for some time--we

chapter which i have torn out, and which otherwise you would all have
been reading just now, instead of this--was the description of my

one of the many things which the destinies had set down in their books
ever to be grumbled at (and in wiser families than ours)--but never to
be mended.

--has the bend-sinister been brush'd out, i say? said my father.--there

now the chapter i was obliged to tear out, was the description of this
cavalcade, in which corporal trim and obadiah, upon two coach-horses
a-breast, led the way as slow as a patrole--whilst my uncle toby, in
his laced regimentals and tye-wig, kept his rank with my father, in deep
roads and dissertations alternately upon the advantage of learning and
arms, as each could get the start.

by the projected wind-mill spoken of above--and for all these reasons
seemed to have the fairest title of any part of the estate to the care
and protection of the family--yet by an unaccountable fatality, common
to men, as well as the ground they tread on--it had all along most
shamefully been overlook'd; and to speak the truth of it, had suffered
so much by it, that it would have made any man's heart have bled
(obadiah said) who understood the value of the land, to have rode over
it, and only seen the condition it was in.

however, as neither the purchasing this tract of ground--nor indeed the
placing of it where it lay, were either of them, properly speaking, of
my father's doing--he had never thought himself any way concerned in
the affair--till the fifteen years before, when the breaking out of

whatever--viewing the arguments on both sides in all their lights and
circumstances--communing every day with my uncle toby--arguing
with yorick, and talking over the whole affair of the ox-moor with
obadiah--yet nothing in all that time appeared so strongly in behalf of
the one, which was not either strictly applicable to the other, or at
least so far counterbalanced by some consideration of equal weight, as
to keep the scales even.

for to be sure, with proper helps, in the hands of some people, tho' the

burning, and fencing in the ox-moor, &c. &c.--with the certain profit it
would bring him in return--the latter turned out so prodigiously in his
way of working the account, that you would have sworn the ox-moor would

chapter 3.ii.

when my father received the letter which brought him the melancholy
account of my brother bobby's death, he was busy calculating the expence
of his riding post from calais to paris, and so on to lyons.

'twas a most inauspicious journey; my father having had every foot of it
to travel over again, and his calculation to begin afresh, when he had
almost got to the end of it, by obadiah's opening the door to acquaint
him the family was out of yeast--and to ask whether he might not
take the great coach-horse early in the morning and ride in search
of some.--with all my heart, obadiah, said my father (pursuing his
journey)--take the coach-horse, and welcome.--but he wants a shoe, poor
creature! said obadiah.--poor creature! said my uncle toby, vibrating
the note back again, like a string in unison. then ride the scotch
horse, quoth my father hastily.--he cannot bear a saddle upo

n his back,
quoth obadiah, for the whole world.--the devil's in that horse; then
take patriot, cried my father, and shut the door.--patriot is sold, said
obadiah. here's for you! cried my father, making a pause, and looking
in my uncle toby's face, as if the thing had not been a matter
of fact.--your worship ordered me to sell him last april, said
obadiah.--then go on foot for your pains, cried my father--i had much
rather walk than ride, said obadiah, shutting the door.

what plagues, cried my father, going on with his calculation.--but the
waters are out, said obadiah,--opening the door again.

till that moment, my father, who had a map of sanson's, and a book
of the post-roads before him, had kept his hand upon the head of his
compasses, with one foot of them fixed upon nevers, the last stage he
had paid for--purposing to go on from that point with his journey and
calculation, as soon as obadiah quitted the room: but this second attack
of
 
 ___________________________
 
 obadiah's, in opening the door and laying the whole country under
water, was too much.--he let go his compasses--or rather with a mixed
motion between accident and anger, he threw them upon the table; and
then there was nothing for him to do, but to return back to calais (like
many others) as wise as he had set out.

when the letter was brought into the parlour, which contained the news
of my brother's death, my father had got forwards again upon his
journey to within a stride of the compasses of the v

unavoidable in a family, his anger, or rather the duration of it,
eternally ran counter to all conjecture.

my father had a favourite little mare, which he had consigned over to a
most beautiful arabian horse, in order to have a pad out of her for his
own riding: he was sanguine in all his projects; so talked about his
pad every day with as absolute a security, as if it had been reared,
broke,--and bridled and saddled at his door ready for mounting. by
some neglect or other in obadiah, it so fell out, that my father's
expectations were answered with nothing better than a mule, and as ugly
a beast of the kind as ever was produced.

my mother and my uncle toby expected my father would be the death of
obadiah--and that there never would be an end of the disaster--see
here! you rascal, cried my father, pointing to the mule, what you have
done!--it was not me, said obadiah.--how do i know that? replied my
father.

philosophy has a fine saying for every thing.--for death it has an
entire set; the misery was, they all at once rushed into my father's
head, that 'twas difficult to string them together, so as to make any
thing of a consistent show out of them.--he took them as they came.

chapter 3.v.

my mother was going very gingerly in the dark along the passage which
led to the parlour, as my uncle toby pronounced the word wife.--'tis a
shrill penetrating sound of itself, and obadiah had helped it by leaving
the door a little a-jar, so that my mother heard enough of it to imagine
herself the subject of the conversation; so laying the edge of her
finger across her two lips--holding in her breath, and bending her head
a little downwards, with a twist of her neck--(not towards the door, but
from it, by which means her ear was brought to the chink)--she listened
with all her powers:--the listening slave, with the goddess of silence
at his back, could not have given a finer thou

hut, but somewhat a-jar--as it stands
just now,--which, under covert of the bad hinge, (and that possibly
might be one of the many reasons why it was never mended,) it was not
difficult to manage; by which means, in all these cases, a passage was
generally left, not indeed as wide as the dardanelles, but wide enough,
for all that, to carry on as much of this windward trade, as was
sufficient to save my father the trouble of governing his house;--my
mother at this moment stands profiting by it.--obadiah did the same
thing, as soon as he had left the letter upon the table which brought
the news of my brother's death, so that before my father had well got
over his surprise, and entered upon his harangue,--had trim got upon his
legs, to speak his sentiments upon the subject.

--a green sattin night-gown of my mother's, which had been twice
scoured, was the first idea which obadiah's exclamation brought
into susannah's head.--well might locke write a chapter upon the
imperfections of words.--then, quoth susannah, we must all go into
mourning.--but note a second time: the word mourning, notwithstanding
susannah made use of it herself--failed also of doing its office; it
excited not one single idea, tinged either with grey or black,--all was
green.--the green satti

under-petticoats.--not a rag was left behind.--'no,--she will never look
up again,' said susannah.

we had a fat, foolish scullion--my father, i think, kept her for her
simplicity;--she had been all autumn struggling with a dropsy.--he
is dead, said obadiah,--he is certainly dead!--so am not i, said the
foolish scullion.

--here is sad news, trim, cried susannah, wiping her eyes as trim
stepp'd into the kitchen,--master bobby is dead and buried--the funeral
was an interpolation of susannah's--we shall have all to go into
mourning, said susannah.

i hope not, said trim.--you hope not! cried susannah earnestly.--the
mourning ran not in trim's head, whatever it did in susannah's.--i

i heard the letter read with my own ears, answered obadiah; and we shall
have a terrible piece of work of it in stubbing the ox-moor.--oh! he's
dead, said susannah.--as sure, said the scullion, as i'm alive.

i lament for him from my heart and my soul, said trim, fetching a
sigh.--poor creature!--poor boy!--poor gentleman!

--he was alive last whitsontide! said the coachman.--whitsontide! alas!
cried trim, extending his right arm, and falling instantly into the same
attitude in which he read the sermon,--what is whitsontide, jonathan
(for that was the

coachman's name), or shrovetide, or any tide or time
past, to this? are we not here now, continued the corporal (striking the
end of his stick perpendicularly upon the floor, so as to give an idea
of health and stability)--and are we not--(dropping his hat upon the
ground) gone! in a moment!--'twas infinitely striking! susannah burst
into a flood of tears.--we are not stocks and stones.--jonathan,
obadiah, the cook-maid, all melted.--the foolish fat scullion herself,
who was scouring a fish-kettle upon her knees, was rous'd with it.--the
whole kitchen crowded about the corporal.

now, as i perceive plainly, that the preservation of our constitution in
church and state,--and possibly the preservation of the whole world--or
what is the same thing, the distribution and balance of its property and
power, may in time to come depend greatly upon the right understanding
of this stroke of the corporal's

obadiah, at all in the field.--but he's very frightful in a house, quoth
obadiah.--i never mind it myself, said jonathan, upon a coach-box.--it
must, in my opinion, be most natural in bed, replied susannah.--and
could i escape him by creeping into the worst calf's skin that ever
was made into a knapsack, i would do it there--said trim--but that is

he would add, whatever betides, i will take care of le fever's boy.--and
with that, like a quieting draught, his honour would fall asleep.

i like to hear trim's stories about the captain, said susannah.--he is
a kindly-hearted gentleman, said obadiah, as ever lived.--aye, and
as brave a one too, said the corporal, as ever stept before a
platoon.--there never was a better officer in the king's army,--or
a better man in god's world; for he would march up to the mouth of a
cannon, though he saw the lighted match at the very touch-hole,--and
yet, for all that, he has a heart as soft as a child for other
people.--he would not hurt a chicken.--i would sooner, quoth jonathan,

this testamentary proof he gave of his affection to his master.--the
whole kitchen was affected.--do tell us the story of the poor
lieutenant, said susannah.--with all my heart, answered the corporal.

susannah, the cook, jonathan, obadiah, and corporal trim, formed a
circle about the fire; and as soon as the scullion had shut the kitchen
door,--the corporal begun.

 it, as i
did--when the accident befel me: it summoned up my mother instantly into
the nursery,--so that susannah had but just time to make her escape down
the back stairs, as my mother came up the fore.

now, though i was old enough to have told the story myself,--and young
enough, i hope, to have done it without malignity; yet susannah, in
passing by the kitchen, for fear of accidents, had left it in short-hand
with the cook--the cook had told it with a commentary to jonathan, and
jonathan to obadiah; so that by the time my father had rung the bell
half a dozen times, to know what was the matter above,--was obadiah
enabled to give him a particular account of it, just as it had
happened.--i thought as much, said my father, tucking up his
night-gown;--and so walked up stairs.

one would imagine from this--(though for my own part i somewhat
question it)--that my father, before that time, had actually wrote that
remarkable character in the tristra-paedia, which to me is the most
original and en

my father put on his spectacles--looked,--took them off,--put them into
the case--all in less than a statutable minute; and without opening
his lips, turned about and walked precipitately down stairs: my mother
imagined he had stepped down for lint and basilicon; but seeing him
return with a couple of folios under his arm, and obadiah following him
with a large reading-desk, she took it for granted 'twas an herbal, and
so drew him a chair to the bedside, that he might consult upon the case
at his ease.

--if it be but right done,--said my father, turning to the section--de
sede vel subjecto circumcisionis,--for he had brought up spenser de
legibus hebraeorum ritualibus--and maimonides, in order to confront and
examine us altogether.--

a project of knitting my father a pair of large worsted breeches--(the
thing is common sense)--and she not caring to be put out of her way,
she staid at home, at shandy hall, to keep things right during the

they had got to the fatal angle of the old garden wall, where doctor
slop was overthrown by obadiah on the coach-horse: as this was directly
opposite to the front of mrs. wadman's house, when my father came to it,
he gave a look across; and seeing my uncle toby and the corporal within
ten paces of the door, he turn'd about--'let us just stop a moment,
quoth my father, and see with what ceremonies my brother toby and his

them--we in-lay them--we enrich them--nay, if it be but a scoundrel
cannon, we cast an ornament upon the breach of it.--

--my uncle toby laid down his pipe to intercede for a better
epithet--and yorick was rising up to batter the whole hypothesis to
pieces--

--when obadiah broke into the middle of the room with a complaint, which
cried out for an immediate hearing.

the case was this:

my father, whether by ancient custom of the manor, or as impropriator
of the great tythes, was obliged to keep a bull for the service of the
parish, and obadiah had led his cow upon a pop-visit to him one day or
other the preceding summer--i say, one day or other--because as chance
would have it, it was the day on which he was married to my father's
house-maid--so one was a reckoni

ng to the other. therefore when
obadiah's wife was brought to bed--obadiah thanked god--

--now, said obadiah, i shall have a calf: so obadiah went daily to visit
his cow.

she'll calve on monday--on tuesday--on wednesday at the farthest--

the cow did not calve--no--she'll not calve till next week--the cow put
it off terribly--till at the end of the sixth week obadiah's suspicions
(like a good man's) fell upon the bull.

now the parish being very large, my father's bull, to speak the truth of
him, was no way equal to the department; he had, however, got himself,
somehow or other, thrust into employment--and as he went through the
business with a grave face, my father had a high opinion of him.

--most of the townsmen, an' please your worship, quoth obadiah, believe
that 'tis all the bull's fault--

--but may not a cow be barren? replied my father, turning to
