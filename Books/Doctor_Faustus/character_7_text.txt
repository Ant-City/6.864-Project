    of power, of honour, of omnipotence,
     is promis'd to the studious artizan!
     all things that move between the quiet poles
     shall be at my command:  emperors and kings
     are but obeyed in their several provinces,
     nor can they raise the wind, or rend the clouds;
     but his dominion that exceeds in this,
     stretcheth as far as doth the mind of man;
     a sound magician is a mighty god:
     here, faustus, tire[21] thy brains to gain a deity.

          enter wagner.[22]

     wagner, commend me to my dearest friends,
     the german valdes and cornelius;
     request them earnestly to visit me.

     wagner. i will, sir.
          [exit.]

     faustus. their conference will be a greater help to me
     than all my labours, plod i ne'er so fast.

          enter good angel and evil angel.

     good angel. o, faustus, lay that damned book aside,
     and gaze not on it, lest it tempt thy soul,
     and heap god's heavy wrath upon thy head!

     faustus. then come and dine with me, and, after meat,
     we'll canvass every quiddity thereof;
     for, ere i sleep, i'll try what i can do:
     this night i'll conjure, though i die therefore.

          enter two scholars.[44]

     first scholar. i wonder what's become of faustus, that was wont
     to make our schools ring with sic probo.

     second scholar. that shall we know, for see, here comes his boy.

          enter wagner.

     first scholar. how now, sirrah! where's thy master?

     wagner. god in heaven knows.

     second scholar. why, dost not thou know?

     wagner. yes, i know; but that follows not.

     first scholar. go to, sirrah! leave your jesting, and tell us
     where he is.

     wagner. that follows not necessary by force of argument, that you,
     being licentiates, should stand upon:[45]  therefore acknowledge
     your error, and be attentive.

     second scholar. well, you will not tell us?

     wagner. yes, sir, i will tell you:  yet, if you were not dunces,
     you would never ask me such a question; for is not he corpus
     naturale? and is not that mobile? then wherefore should you
     ask me such a question?  but that i am by nature phlegmatic,
     slow to wrath, and prone to lechery (to love, i would say),
     it were not for you to come within forty foot of the place
     of execution, although i do not doubt to see you both hanged
     the next sessions.  thus having trium

     to pass the ocean with a band of men;
     i'll join the hills that bind the afric shore,
     and make that country[63] continent to spain,
     and both contributory to my crown:
     the emperor shall not live but by my leave,
     nor any potentate of germany.
     now that i have obtain'd what i desir'd,[64]
     i'll live in speculation of this art,

     clown. ay, and goings out too; you may see else.

     the villain is bare and out of service, and so hungry, that i know

     clown. how! my soul to the devil for a shoulder of mutton, though
     'twere blood-raw! not so, good friend:  by'r lady,[67] i had need
     have it well roasted, and good sauce to it, if i pay so dear.

     wagner. well, wilt thou serve me, and i'll make thee go like
     qui mihi discipulus?[68]

     clown. how, in verse?

     wagner. no, sirrah; in beaten silk and staves-acre.[69]

     clown. how, how, knaves-acre! ay, i thought that was all the land
     his father left him.  do you hear?  i would be sorry to rob you of
     your living.

     wagner. sirrah, i say in staves-acre.

     clown. do you hear, sir? you may save that labour; they are too
     familiar with me already:  swowns, they are as bold with my flesh
     as if they had paid for their[72] meat and drink.

     wagner. well, do you hear, sirrah? hold, take these guilders.

     clown. mass, but for the name of french crowns, a man were as good
     have as many english counters.  and what should i do with these?

     wagner. why, now, sirrah, thou art at an hour's warning, whensoever
     or wheresoever the devil shall fetch thee.

     clown. no, no; here, take your gridirons again.

     clown. let your baliol and your belcher come here, and i'll
     knock them, they were never so knocked since they were devils:
     say i should kill one of them, what would folks say?  "do ye see
     yonder tall fellow in the round slop?[73] he has killed the devil."
     so i should be called kill-devil all the parish over.

          enter two devils; and the clown runs up and down crying.

     long nails.  there was a he-devil and a she-devil:  i'll tell you

     she-devils has clifts and cloven feet.

     wagner. well, sirrah, follow me.

     clown. but, do you hear? if i should serve you, would you teach
     me to raise up banios and belcheos?

     wagner. i will teach thee to turn thyself to any thing, to a dog,
     or a cat, or a mouse, or a rat, or any thing.

     clown. how! a christian fellow to a dog, or a cat, a mouse,
     or a rat! no, no, sir; if you turn me into any thing, let it be

     mephist. all jointly move from east to west in twenty-four hours
     upon the poles of the world; but differ in their motion upon

     faustus. tush,
     these slender trifles wagner can decide:
     hath mephistophilis no greater skill?
     who knows not the double motion of the planets?
     the first is finish'd in a natural day;
     the second thus; as saturn in thirty years; jupiter in twelve;
     mars in four; the sun, venus, and mercury in a year; the moon in
     twenty-eight days.  tush, these are freshmen's[102] suppositions.

     wagner. sir, the duke of vanholt doth earnestly entreat your
