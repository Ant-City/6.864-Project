e liked to retort; stupefaction, rage, indignation,
deprived him of words. moreover, the suggestion of the popular hosier
was received with such enthusiasm by these bourgeois who were flattered
at being called “squires,” that all resistance was useless. there was
nothing to be done but to allow one’s self to drift with the torrent.
gringoire hid his face between his two hands, not being so fortunate
as to have a mantle with which to veil his head, like agamemnon of
timantis.



chapter v. quasimodo.



in the twinkling of an eye, all was ready to execute coppenole’s idea.
bourgeois, scholars and law clerks all set to work. the little chapel
situated opposite the marble table was selected for the scene of the
grinning match. a pane broken in the pretty rose window above the
door, left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the
competitors should thrust their heads. in order to reach it, it was only
necessary to mount upon a couple of hogsheads, which had been produced

one would have pronounced him a giant who had been broken and badly put
together again.

when this species of cyclops appeared on the threshold of the chapel,
motionless, squat, and almost as broad as he was tall; squared on the
base, as a great man says; with his doublet half red, half violet, sown
with silver bells, and, above all, in the perfection of his ugliness,
the populace recognized him on the instant, and shouted with one
voice,--

“‘tis quasimodo, the bellringer! ‘tis quasimodo, the hunchback of
notre-dame! quasimodo, the one-eyed! quasimodo, the bandy-legged! noel!
noel!”

it will be seen that the poor fellow had a choice of surnames.

“let the women with child beware!” shouted the scholars.

“or those who wish to be,” resumed joannes.

the women did, in fact, hide their faces.

“oh! the horrible monkey!” said one of them.

“as wicked as he is ugly,” retorted another.

“he’s the devil,” added a third.

“i ha

“with the cats.”

“he’s always on our roofs.”

“he throws spells down our chimneys.”

“the other evening, he came and made a grimace at me through my attic
window. i thought that it was a man. such a fright as i had!”

“i’m sure that he goes to the witches’ sabbath. once he left a broom on
my leads.”

“oh! what a displeasing hunchback’s face!”

“oh! what an ill-favored soul!”

“whew!”

the men, on the contrary, were delighted and applauded. quasimodo, the
object of the tumult, still stood on the threshold of the chapel, sombre
and grave, and allowed them to admire him.

one scholar (robin poussepain, i think), came and laughed in his face,
and too close. quasimodo contented himself with taking him by the
girdle, and hurling him ten paces off amid the crowd; all without
uttering a word.

master coppenole, in amazement, approached him.

“cross of god! holy father! you possess the handsomest ugliness that i
have ever beheld in my life. you w

ould deserve to be pope at rome, as
well as at paris.”

so saying, he placed his hand gayly on his shoulder. quasimodo did not
stir. coppenole went on,--

“you are a rogue with whom i have a fancy for carousing, were it to cost
me a new dozen of twelve livres of tours. how does it strike you?”

quasimodo made no reply.

“cross of god!” said the hosier, “are you deaf?”

he was, in truth, deaf.

nevertheless, he began to grow impatient with coppenole’s behavior, and
suddenly turned towards him with so formidable a gnashing of teeth, that
the flemish giant recoiled, like a bull-dog before a cat.

then there was created around that strange personage, a circle of terror
and respect, whose radius was at least fifteen geometrical feet. an old
woman explained to coppenole that quasimodo was d

eaf.

“deaf!” said the hosier, with his great flemish laugh. “cross of god!
he’s a perfect pope!”

“he! i recognize him,” exclaimed jehan, who had, at last, descended from
his capital, in order to see quasimodo at closer quarters, “he’s the
bellringer of my brother, the archdeacon. good-day, quasimodo!”

“what a devil of a man!” said robin poussepain still all bruised
with his fall. “he shows himself; he’s a hunchback. he walks; he’s
bandy-legged. he looks at you; he’s one-eyed. you speak to him; he’s
deaf. and what does this polyphemus do with his tongue?”

“he speaks when he chooses,” said the old woman; “he became deaf through
ringing the bells. he is not dumb.”

“that he lacks,” remarks jehan.

“and he has one eye too many,” added robin poussepain.

“n

ot at all,” said jehan wisely. “a one-eyed man is far less complete
than a blind man. he knows what he lacks.”

in the meantime, all the beggars, all the lackeys, all the cutpurses,
joined with the scholars, had gone in procession to seek, in the
cupboard of the law clerks’ company, the cardboard tiara, and the
derisive robe of the pope of the fools. quasimodo allowed them to array
him in them without wincing, and with a sort of proud docility. then
they made him seat himself on a motley litter. twelve officers of the
fraternity of fools raised him on their shoulders; and a sort of bitter
and disdainful joy lighted up the morose face of the cyclops, when he
beheld beneath his deformed feet all those heads of handsome, straight,
well-made men. then the ragged and howling procession set out on its
march, according to custom, around the inner galleries

chapter vi. esmeralda.



we are delighted to be able to inform the reader, that during the whole
of this scene, gringoire and his piece had stood firm. his actors,
spurred on by him, had not ceased to spout his comedy, and he had not
ceased to listen to it. he had made up his mind about the tumult, and
was determined to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return
of attention on the part of the public. this gleam of hope acquired
fresh life, when he saw quasimodo, coppenole, and the deafening escort
of the pope of the procession of fools quit the hall amid great uproar.
the throng rushed eagerly after them. “good,” he said to himself, “there
go all the mischief-makers.” unfortunately, all the mischief-makers
constituted the entire audience. in the twinkling of an eye, the grand
hall was empty.

to tell the truth, a few spectators still remained, some scattered,
others in groups around the pillars, women, old men, or children,
who had had enough

then he beat a retreat, with drooping head, but the last in the field,
like a general who has fought well.

and as he descended the winding stairs of the courts: “a fine rabble of
asses and dolts these parisians!” he muttered between his teeth; “they
come to hear a mystery and don’t listen to it at all! they are engrossed
by every one, by chopin trouillefou, by the cardinal, by coppenole, by

of all came the corporation of law clerks, with its maypoles crowned
with flowers, its black robes, its music worthy of the orgy, and its
large candles of yellow wax. in the centre of this crowd, the grand
officers of the brotherhood of fools bore on their shoulders a litter
more loaded down with candles than the reliquary of sainte-geneviève in
time of pest; and on this litter shone resplendent, with crosier, cope,
and mitre, the new pope of the fools, the bellringer of notre-dame,
quasimodo the hunchback.

each section of this grotesque procession had its own music. the
egyptians made their drums and african tambourines resound. the slang
men, not a very musical race, still clung to the goat’s horn trumpet and
the gothic rubebbe of the twelfth century. the empire of galilee was not
much more advanced; among its music one could hardly distinguish some
miserable rebec, from the infancy of the art, still imprisoned in the
_re-la-mi_. but it was around the pope of the fools that all

 the musical
riches of the epoch were displayed in a magnificent discord. it was
nothing but soprano rebecs, counter-tenor rebecs, and tenor rebecs,
not to reckon the flutes and brass instruments. alas! our readers will
remember that this was gringoire’s orchestra.

it is difficult to convey an idea of the degree of proud and blissful
expansion to which the sad and hideous visage of quasimodo had attained
during the transit from the palais de justice, to the place de grève. it
was the first enjoyment of self-love that he had ever experienced. down
to that day, he had known only humiliation, disdain for his condition,
disgust for his person. hence, deaf though he was, he enjoyed, like a
veritable pope, the acclamations of that throng, which he hated because
he felt that he was hated by it. what mattered it that his people
consisted of a pack of fools, cripples, thieves, and beggars?
 
 ___________________________
 
that the new pope of the fools
understood both the sentiments which he felt and the sentiments which
he inspired. the spirit which was lodged in this failure of a body had,
necessarily, something incomplete and deaf about it. thus, what he felt
at the moment was to him, absolutely vague, indistinct, and confused.
only joy made itself felt, only pride dominated. around that sombre and
unhappy face, there hung a radiance.

it was, then, not without surprise and alarm, that at the very moment
when quasimodo was passing the pillar house, in that semi-intoxicated
state, a man was seen to dart from the crowd, and to tear from his
hands, with a gesture of anger, his crosier of gilded wood, the emblem
of his mock popeship.

this man, this rash individual, was the man with the bald brow, who,
a moment earlier, standing with the gypsy’s group had chilled the
poor girl with his words of menace and of hatred. he was dressed in
an ecclesiastical costume. at the moment when he stood forth from the
crowd, g

ringoire, who had not noticed him up to that time, recognized
him: “hold!” he said, with an exclamation of astonishment. “eh! ‘tis my
master in hermes, dom claude frollo, the archdeacon! what the devil does
he want of that old one-eyed fellow? he’ll get himself devoured!”

a cry of terror arose, in fact. the formidable quasimodo had hurled
himself from the litter, and the women turned aside their eyes in order
not to see him tear the archdeacon asunder.

he made one bound as far as the priest, looked at him, and fell upon his
knees.

the priest tore off his tiara, broke his crozier, and rent his tinsel
cope.

quasimodo remained on his knees, with head bent and hands clasped.
then there was established between them a strange dialogue of signs
and gestures, for neither of them spoke. the priest, erect on his
feet, irrita

ted, threatening, imperious; quasimodo, prostrate, humble,
suppliant. and, nevertheless, it is certain that quasimodo could have
crushed the priest with his thumb.

at length the archdeacon, giving quasimodo’s powerful shoulder a rough
shake, made him a sign to rise and follow him.

quasimodo rose.

then the brotherhood of fools, their first stupor having passed off,
wished to defend their pope, so abruptly dethroned. the egyptians, the
men of slang, and all the fraternity of law clerks, gathered howling
round the priest.

quasimodo placed himself in front of the priest, set in play the muscles
of his athletic fists, and glared upon the assailants with the snarl of
an angry tiger.

the priest resumed his sombre gravity, made a sign to quasimodo, and
retired in silence.

when they had traversed the populace and the place, the cloud of curious
and idle were minded to follow them. quasimodo then constituted himself
the rearguard, and followed the archdeacon, walking backwards, squat,
surly, monstrous, bristling, gathering up his limbs, licking his boar’s
tusks, growling like a wild beast, and imparting to the crowd immense
vibrations, with a look or a gesture.

both were allowed to plunge into a dark and narrow street, where no
one dared to venture after them; so thoroughly did the mere chimera of
quasimodo gnashing his teeth bar the entrance.

t was full of shadows. nevertheless, a twist of tow soaked in
oil, which burned in a cage at the feet of the holy virgin at the street
corner, permitted gringoire to make out the gypsy struggling in the arms
of two men, who were endeavoring to stifle her cries. the poor little
goat, in great alarm, lowered his horns and bleated.

“help! gentlemen of the watch!” shouted gringoire, and advanced bravely.
one of the men who held the young girl turned towards him. it was the
formidable visage of quasimodo.

gringoire did not take to flight, but neither did he advance another
step.

quasimodo came up to him, tossed him four paces away on the pavement
with a backward turn of the hand, and plunged rapidly into the gloom,
bearing the young girl folded across one arm like a silken scarf. his
companion followed him, and the poor goat ran after them all, bleating
plaintively.

“murder! murder!” shrieked the unhappy gypsy.

“halt, rascals, and yield me that wench!” suddenly shouted in a voice of

it was a captain of the king’s archers, armed from head to foot, with
his sword in his hand.

he tore the gypsy from the arms of the dazed quasimodo, threw her across
his saddle, and at the moment when the terrible hunchback, recovering
from his surprise, rushed upon him to regain his prey, fifteen or
sixteen archers, who followed their captain closely, made their
appearance, with their two-edged swords in their fists. it was a squad
of the king’s police, which was making the rounds, by order of messire
robert d’estouteville, guard of the provostship of paris.

“what is your name, monsieur le gendarme?”

“captain phoebus de châteaupers, at your service, my beauty!” replied
the officer, drawing himself up.

“thanks,” said she.

and while captain phoebus was turning up his moustache in burgundian
fashion, she slipped from the horse, like an arrow falling to earth, and
fled.

a flash of lightning would have vanished less quickly.

“nombrill of the pope!” said the captain, causing quasimodo’s straps to
be drawn tighter, “i should have preferred to keep the wench.”

“what would you have, captain?” said one gendarme. “the warbler has
fled, and the bat remains.”




chapter v. result of the dangers.


gringoire, thoroughly stunned by his fall, remained on the pavement
in front of the holy virgin at the street corner. little by little, he
regained his senses; at first, for several minutes, he was floating in a
sort of half-somnolent revery, which was not without its char

aeriel figures of the gypsy and her goat were coupled with quasimodo’s
heavy fist. this state lasted but a short time. a decidedly vivid
sensation of cold in the part of his body which was in contact with the
pavement, suddenly aroused him and caused his spirit to return to the
surface.

“whence comes this chill?” he said abruptly, to himself. he then
perceived that he was lying half in the middle of the gutter.

“that devil of a hunchbacked cyclops!” he muttered between his teeth;
and he tried to rise. but he was too much dazed and bruised; he was

can one do in a refuge, except dream?--“the mud of paris is particularly
stinking; it must contain a great deal of volatile and nitric salts.
that, moreover, is the opinion of master nicholas flamel, and of the
alchemists--”

the word “alchemists” suddenly suggested to his mind the idea of
archdeacon claude frollo. he recalled the violent scene which he had
just witnessed in part; that the gypsy was struggling with two men,
that quasimodo had a companion; and the morose and haughty face of
the archdeacon passed confusedly through his memory. “that would be
strange!” he said to himself. and on that fact and that basis he began
to construct a fantastic edifice of hypothesis, that card-castle of
philosophers; then, suddenly returning once more to reality, “come! i’m
freezing!” he ejaculated.

the place was, in fact, becoming less and less tenable. each molecule

gringoire colored, and took the hint. it was evident that the young girl
was alluding to the slight assistance which he had rendered her in the
critical situation in which she had found herself two hours previously.
this memory, effaced by his own adventures of the evening, now recurred
to him. he smote his brow.

“by the way, mademoiselle, i ought to have begun there. pardon my
foolish absence of mind. how did you contrive to escape from the claws
of quasimodo?”

this question made the gypsy shudder.

“oh! the horrible hunchback,” said she, hiding her face in her hands.
and she shuddered as though with violent cold.

“horrible, in truth,” said gringoire, who clung to his idea; “but how
did you manage to escape him?”

la esmeralda smiled, sighed, and remained silent.

“do you know why he followed you?” began gringoire again, seeking to
return to his question by a circuitous route.

chapter i. good souls.



sixteen years previous to the epoch when this story takes place, one
fine morning, on quasimodo sunday, a living creature had been deposited,
after mass, in the church of notre-dame, on the wooden bed securely
fixed in the vestibule on the left, opposite that great image of saint
christopher, which the figure of messire antoine des essarts, chevalier,
carved in stone, had been gazing at on his knees since 1413, when
they took it into their heads to overthrow the saint and the faithful
follower. upon this bed of wood it was customary to expose foundlings
for public charity. whoever cared t

wooden bed was a copper basin for alms.

the sort of living being which lay upon that plank on the morning of
quasimodo, in the year of the lord, 1467, appeared to excite to a high
degree, the curiosity of the numerous group which had congregated about
the wooden bed. the group was formed for the most part of the fair sex.
hardly any one was there except old women.

in the first row, and among those who were most bent over the bed, four
were noticeable, who, from their gray _cagoule_, a sort of cassock, were
recognizable as attached to some devout sisterhood. i do not see

there, plunged more deeply than ever in his dear books, which he quitted
only to run for an hour to the fief of moulin, this mixture of learning
and austerity, so rare at his age, had promptly acquired for him
the respect and admiration of the monastery. from the cloister, his
reputation as a learned man had passed to the people, among whom it had
changed a little, a frequent occurrence at that time, into reputation as
a sorcerer.

it was at the moment when he was returning, on quasimodo day, from
saying his mass at the altar of the lazy, which was by the side of the
door leading to the nave on the right, near the image of the virgin,
that his attention had been attracted by the group of old women
chattering around the bed for foundlings.

then it was that he approached the unhappy little creature, which was so
hated and so menaced. that distress, that deformity, that abandonment,
the thought of his young brother, the idea which suddenly occurred to
him, that if he were to die,
 
 ___________________________
 
er, in order that,
whatever might be the future faults of the little jehan, he should have
beside him that charity done for his sake. it was a sort of investment
of good works, which he was effecting in the name of his young brother;
it was a stock of good works which he wished to amass in advance for
him, in case the little rogue should some day find himself short of that
coin, the only sort which is received at the toll-bar of paradise.

he baptized his adopted child, and gave him the name of quasimodo,
either because he desired thereby to mark the day, when he had found
him, or because he wished to designate by that name to what a degree the
poor little creature was incomplete, and hardly sketched out. in fact,
quasimodo, blind, hunchbacked, knock-kneed, was only an “almost.”




chapter iii. _immanis pecoris custos, immanior ipse_.



now, in 1482, quasimodo had grown up. he had become a few years
previously the bellringer of notre-dame, thanks to his father by
adoption, claude frollo,-

to his suzerain, messire louis de beaumont,--who had become bishop of
paris, at the death of guillaume chartier in 1472, thanks to his patron,
olivier le daim, barber to louis xi., king by the grace of god.

so quasimodo was the ringer of the chimes of notre-dame.

in the course of time there had been formed a certain peculiarly
intimate bond which united the ringer to the church. separated forever
from the world, by the double fatality of his unknown birth and his
natural deformity, imprisoned from his infancy in that impassable double
circle, the poor wretch had grown used to seeing nothing in this world
beyond the religious walls which had received him under their shadow.

it is useless to warn the reader not to take literally all the
similes which we are obliged to employ here to express the singular,
symmetrical, direct, almost consubstantial union of a man and an
edifice. it is equally unnecessary to state to what a degree that
whole cathedral was familiar to him, after so long and so intimate a
cohabitation. that dwelling was peculiar to him. it had no depths to
which quasimodo had not penetrated, no height which he had not scaled.
he often climbed many stones up the front, aided solely by the uneven
points of the carving. the towers, on whose exterior surface he was
frequently seen clambering, like a lizard gliding along a perpendicular
wall, those two gigantic twins, so lofty, so menacing, so formidable,
possessed for him neither vertigo, nor terror, nor shocks of amazement.

to see them so gentle under his hand, so easy to scale, one would have
said that he had tam

amid the abysses of the gigantic cathedral he had become, in some sort,
a monkey and a goat, like the calabrian child who swims before he walks,
and plays with the sea while still a babe.

moreover, it was not his body alone which seemed fashioned after the
cathedral, but his mind also. in what condition was that mind? what
bent had it contracted, what form had it assumed beneath that knotted
envelope, in that savage life? this it would be hard to determine.
quasimodo had been born one-eyed, hunchbacked, lame. it was with
great difficulty, and by dint of great patience that claude frollo had
succeeded in teaching him to talk. but a fatality was attached to the
poor foundling. bellringer of notre-dame at the age of fourteen, a new
infirmity had come to complete his misfortunes: the bells had broken the
drums of his ears; he had become deaf. the only gate which nature had
left wide open for him had been abruptly closed, and forever.

in closing, it had cut off

 the only ray of joy and of light which still
made its way into the soul of quasimodo. his soul fell into profound
night. the wretched being’s misery became as incurable and as complete
as his deformity. let us add that his deafness rendered him to some
extent dumb. for, in order not to make others laugh, the very moment
that he found himself to be deaf, he resolved upon a silence which he
only broke when he was alone. he voluntarily tied that tongue which
claude frollo had taken so much pains to unloose. hence, it came about,
that when necessity constrained him to speak, his

tongue was torpid,
awkward, and like a door whose hinges have grown rusty.

if now we were to try to penetrate to the soul of quasimodo through that
thick, hard rind; if we could sound the depths of that badly constructed
organism; if it were granted to us to look with a torch behind those
non-transparent organs to explore the shadowy interior of that opaque
creature, to elucidate his obscure corners, his absurd no-thoroughfares,
and suddenly to cast a vivid light upon the soul enchained at the
extremity of that cave, we should, no doubt, find the unhappy psyche in
some poor, cramped, and ricketty attitude, like those prisoners

it is certain that the mind becomes atrophied in a defective body.
quasimodo was barely conscious of a soul cast in his own image, moving
blindly within him. the impressions of objects underwent a considerable
refraction before reaching his mind. his brain was a peculiar medium;
the ideas which passed through it issued forth completely distorted.
the reflection which resulted from this refraction was, necessarily,
divergent and perverted.

a thousand deviations, in which his thought strayed, now mad

d found nothing but hatred around him. he had caught the
general malevolence. he had picked up the weapon with which he had been
wounded.

after all, he turned his face towards men only with reluctance;
his cathedral was sufficient for him. it was peopled with marble
figures,--kings, saints, bishops,--who at least did not burst out
laughing in his face, and who gazed upon him only with tranquillity
and kindliness. the other statues, those of the monsters and demons,
cherished no hatred for him, quasimodo. he resembled them too much for
that. they seemed rather, to be scoffing at other men. the saints were
his friends, and blessed him; the monsters were his friends and guarded
him. so he held long communion with them. he sometimes passed whole
hours crouching before one of these statues, in solitary conversation
with it. if any one came, he fled like a lover surprised in his
serenade.

and the cathedral was not only society for him, but the universe, and
all nature beside. he dreamed of no other

up in a smaller cage beside hers. this jacqueline was so called from the
name of the wife of jean montagu, who had given it to the church, which
had not prevented his going and figuring without his head at montfauçon.
in the second tower there were six other bells, and, finally, six
smaller ones inhabited the belfry over the crossing, with the wooden
bell, which rang only between after dinner on good friday and the
morning of the day before easter. so quasimodo had fifteen bells in his
seraglio; but big marie was his favorite.

no idea can be formed of his delight on days when the grand peal was
sounded. at the moment when the archdeacon dismissed him, and said,
“go!” he mounted the spiral staircase of the clock tower faster than any
one else could have descended it. he entered perfectly breathless into
the aerial chamber of the great bell; he gazed at her a moment, devoutly
and lovingly; then he gently addressed her and patted her with his
hand,

like a good horse, which is about to set out on a long journey.
he pitied her for the trouble that she was about to suffer. after these
first caresses, he shouted to his assistants, placed in the lower story
of the tower, to begin. they grasped the ropes, the wheel creaked, the
enormous capsule of metal started slowly into motion. quasimodo followed
it with his glance and trembled. the first shock of the clapper and
the brazen wall made the framework upon which it was mounted quiver.
quasimodo vibrated with the bell.

“vah!” he cried, with a senseless burst of laughter. however, the
movement of the bass was accelerated, and, in proportion as it described
a wider angle, quasimodo’s eye opened also more and more widely,
phosphoric and flaming. at length the grand peal began; the whole tower
trembled; woodwork, leads, cut stones, all groaned at once, from the
piles of the foundation to the trefoils of its summit. then quasimodo
boiled and frothed; he went and came; he trembled fro

the tower. the bell, furious, running riot, presented to the two
walls of the tower alternately its brazen throat, whence escaped that
tempestuous breath, which is audible leagues away. quasimodo stationed
himself in front of this open throat; he crouched and rose with the
oscillations of the bell, breathed in this overwhelming breath, gazed
by turns at the deep place, which swarmed with people, two hundred feet
below him, and at that enormous, brazen tongue which came, second after
second, to howl in his ear.

it was the only speech which he understood, the only sound which broke
for him the universal silence. he swelled out in it as a bird does in

to and fro by the formidable swinging of the bell, he seized the brazen
monster by the ear-laps, pressed it between both knees, spurred it on
with his heels, and redoubled the fury of the peal with the whole shock
and weight of his body. meanwhile, the tower trembled; he shrieked and
gnashed his teeth, his red hair rose erect, his breast heaving like a
bellows, his eye flashed flames, the monstrous bell neighed, panting,
beneath him; and then it was no longer the great bell of notre-dame nor
quasimodo: it was a dream, a whirlwind, a tempest, dizziness mounted
astride of noise; a spirit clinging to a flying crupper, a strange
centaur, half man, half bell; a sort of horrible astolphus, borne away
upon a prodigious hippogriff of living bronze.

the presence of this extraordinary being caused, as it were, a breath of
life to circulate throughout the entire cathedral. it seemed as though
there escaped from him, at least according to the growing superstitions
of the crowd, a mysterious emanation w

it sufficed for people to know that he was there, to make them believe
that they beheld the thousand statues of the galleries and the fronts in
motion. and the cathedral did indeed seem a docile and obedient creature
beneath his hand; it waited on his will to raise its great voice; it
was possessed and filled with quasimodo, as with a familiar spirit.
one would have said that he made the immense edifice breathe. he was
everywhere about it; in fact, he multiplied himself on all points of the
structure. now one perceived with affright at the very top of one of
the towers, a fantastic dwarf climbing, writhing, crawling on all
fours, descending outside above the abyss, leaping from projection to
projection, and going to ransack the belly of some sculptured gorgon; it
was quasimodo dislodging the crows. again, in some

obscure corner of the
church one came in contact with a sort of living chimera, crouching
and scowling; it was quasimodo engaged in thought. sometimes one caught
sight, upon a bell tower, of an enormous head and a bundle of disordered
limbs swinging furiously at the end of a rope; it was quasimodo ringing
vespers or the angelus. often at night a hideous form was seen wandering
along the frail balustrade of carved lacework, which crowns the towers
and borders the circumference of the apse; again it was the hunchback of
notre-dame. then, said the women of the neighborhood, the whole church
took on something fantastic, supernatural, horrible; eyes and mouths
were opened, here and there; one heard the dogs, the monsters, and the
gargoyles of stone, which keep watch night and day, with outstr

neck and open jaws, around the monstrous cathedral, barking. and, if
it was a christmas eve, while the great bell, which seemed to emit the
death rattle, summoned the faithful to the midnight mass, such an air
was spread over the sombre façade that one would have declared that
the grand portal was devouring the throng, and that the rose window was
watching it. and all this came from quasimodo. egypt would have taken
him for the god of this temple; the middle ages believed him to be its
demon: he was in fact its soul.

to such an extent was this disease that for those who know that
quasimodo has existed, notre-dame is to-day deserted, inanimate, dead.
one feels that something has disappeared from it. that immense body is
empty; it is a skeleton; the spirit has quitted it, one sees its place
and that is all. it is like a skull which still has holes for the eyes,
but no longer sight.

chapter iv. the dog and his master.



nevertheless, there was one human creature whom quasimodo excepted from
his malice and from his hatred for others, and whom he loved even more,
perhaps, than his cathedral: this was claude frollo.

the matter was simple; claude frollo had taken him in, had adopted him,
had nourished him, had reared him. when a little lad, it was between
claude frollo’s legs that he was accustomed to seek refuge, when the
dogs and the children barked after him. claude frollo had taught him
to talk, to read, to write. claude frollo had finally made him the
bellringer.

 now, to give the big bell in marriage to quasimodo was to
give juliet to romeo.

hence quasimodo’s gratitude was profound, passionate, boundless; and
although the visage of his adopted father was often clouded or severe,
although his speech was habitually curt, harsh, imperious, that
gratitude never wavered for a single moment. the archdeacon had in
quasimodo the most submissive slave, the most docile lackey, the most
vigilant of dogs. when the poor bellringer became deaf, there had
been established between him and claude frollo, a language of signs,
mysterious and understood by themselves alone. in this manner the
archdeacon was the sole human being with whom quasimodo had preserved
communication. he was in sympathy with but two things in this world:
notre-dame and claude frollo.

there is nothing which can be compared with the empire of the archde

over the bellringer; with the attachment of the bellringer for the
archdeacon. a sign from claude and the idea of giving him pleasure would
have sufficed to make quasimodo hurl himself headlong from the summit of
notre-dame. it was a remarkable thing--all that physical strength which
had reached in quasimodo such an extraordinary development, and which
was placed by him blindly at the disposition of another. there was in
it, no doubt, filial devotion, domestic attachment; there was also the
fascination of one spirit by another spirit. it was a poor, awkward, and
clumsy organization, which stood with lowered head and supplicating eyes
before a lofty and profound, a powerful and superior intellect. lastly,
and above all, it was gratitude. gratitude so pushed to its extremest
limit, that we do not kno

w to what to compare it. this virtue is not one
of those of which the finest examples are to be met with among men. we
will say then, that quasimodo loved the archdeacon as never a dog, never
a horse, never an elephant loved his master.




chapter v. more about claude frollo.



in 1482, quasimodo was about twenty years of age; claude frollo, about
thirty-six. one had grown up, the other had grown old.

claude frollo was no longer the simple scholar of the college of torch,
the tender protector of a little child, the young and dreamy philosopher
who knew many things and was ignorant of many. he was a priest, austere,
grave, morose; one charged with souls; monsieur the archdeacon of josas,
the bishop’s second acolyte, having charge of the two deaneries of
montlhéry, and châteaufort, a

of vision of that raven which belongs to the left front, and which is
looking at a mysterious point inside the church, where is concealed the
philosopher’s stone, if it be not in the cellar of nicolas flamel.

it was, let us remark in passing, a singular fate for the church of
notre-dame at that epoch to be so beloved, in two different degrees,
and with so much devotion, by two beings so dissimilar as claude and
quasimodo. beloved by one, a sort of instinctive and savage half-man,
for its beauty, for its stature, for the harmonies which emanated from
its magnificent ensemble; beloved by the other, a learned and passionate
imagination, for its myth, for the sense which it contains, for the
symbolism scattered beneath the sculptures of its front,--like the first
text underneath the second in a palimpsest,--in a word, for the enigma
which it is eternally propounding to the understanding.

furthermore, it is certain

before the gentlemen of the officialty of notre-dame. whether this
was sincere horror, or the game played by the thief who shouts, “stop
thief!” at all events, it did not prevent the archdeacon from being
considered by the learned heads of the chapter, as a soul who had
ventured into the vestibule of hell, who was lost in the caves of the
cabal, groping amid the shadows of the occult sciences. neither were
the people deceived thereby; with any one who possessed any sagacity,
quasimodo passed for the demon; claude frollo, for the sorcerer. it
was evident that the bellringer was to serve the archdeacon for a given
time, at the end of which he would carry away the latter’s soul, by way
of payment. thus the archdeacon, in spite of the excessive austerity of
his life, was in bad odor among all pious souls; and there was no devout
nose so inexperienced that it could not smell him out to be a magician.

and if, as he grew older, abysses had formed in his science, they had

same length of time, he had been ransacking the mouldy placards of

condemned to fire or the rope, for complicity in crimes with rams, sows,
or goats.




chapter vi. unpopularity.



the archdeacon and the bellringer, as we have already said, were but
little loved by the populace great and small, in the vicinity of the
cathedral. when claude and quasimodo went out together, which frequently
happened, and when they were seen traversing in company, the valet
behind the master, the cold, narrow, and gloomy streets of the block of
notre-dame, more than one evil word, more than one ironical quaver, more
than one insulting jest greeted them on their way, unless claude frollo,
which was rarely the case, walked with head upright and raised, showing
his severe and almost august brow to the dumbfounded jeerers.

both were in their quarter like “the poet

sometimes a mischievous child risked his skin and bones for the
ineffable pleasure of driving a pin into quasimodo’s hump. again, a
young girl, more bold and saucy than was fitting, brushed the priest’s
black robe, singing in his face the sardonic ditty, “niche, niche, the
devil is caught.” sometimes a group of squalid old crones, squatting in
a file under the shadow of the steps to a porch, scolded noisily as the
archdeacon and the bellringer passed, and tossed them this encouraging
welcome, with a curse: “hum! there’s a fellow whose soul is made like
the other one’s body!” or a band of sch

playing hop-scotch, rose in a body and saluted him classically, with
some cry in latin: “_eia! eia! claudius cum claudo_!”

but the insult generally passed unnoticed both by the priest and the
bellringer. quasimodo was too deaf to hear all these gracious things,
and claude was too dreamy.

dom claude’s fame had spread far and wide. it procured for him, at about
the epoch when he refused to see madame de beaujeu, a visit which he
long remembered.

it was in the evening. he had just retired, after the office, to
his canon’s cell in the cloister of notre-dame. this cell, with the
exception, possibly, of some glass phials, relegated to a corner, a

_hercle_! ‘tis our prince of yesterday, our pope of the fools,
our bellringer, our one-eyed man, our hunchback, our grimace! ‘tis

it was he indeed.

it was quasimodo, bound, encircled, roped, pinioned, and under good
guard. the squad of policemen who surrounded him was assisted by the
chevalier of the watch in person, wearing the arms of france embroidered
on his breast, and the arms of the city on his back. there was nothing,
however, about quasimodo, except his deformity, which could justify the
display of halberds and arquebuses; he was gloomy, silent, and tranquil.
only now and then did his single eye cast a sly

and wrathful glance upon
the bonds with which he was loaded.

he cast the same glance about him, but it was so dull and sleepy that
the women only pointed him out to each other in derision.

meanwhile master florian, the auditor, turned over attentively the
document in the complaint entered against quasimodo, which the clerk
handed him, and, having thus glanced at it, appeared to reflect for a
moment. thanks to this precaution, which he always was careful to take
at the moment when on the point of beginning an examination, he knew
beforehand the names, titles, and misdeeds of the accused, made cut
and dried responses to questions foreseen, and succeeded in extricating
himself from all the windings of the interrogation without allowing his
deafness to be too apparent. the written charges were to him

 the eyes of all, and he generally succeeded so well that he had
reached the point of deluding himself, which is, by the way, easier
than is supposed. all hunchbacks walk with their heads held high, all
stutterers harangue, all deaf people speak low. as for him, he believed,
at the most, that his ear was a little refractory. it was the sole
concession which he made on this point to public opinion, in his moments
of frankness and examination of his conscience.

having, then, thoroughly ruminated quasimodo’s affair, he threw back
his head and half closed his eyes, for the sake of more majesty and
impartiality, so that, at that moment, he was both deaf and blind. a
double condition, without which no judge is perfect. it was in this
magisterial attitude that he began the examination.

“your name?”

now this was a case which had not been “provided for by law,” where a
deaf man should be obliged to question a deaf man.

quasimodo, whom nothing warned that a question had been addressed to
hi
 
 ___________________________
 
m, continued to stare intently at the judge, and made no reply. the
judge, being deaf, and being in no way warned of the deafness of the
accused, thought that the latter had answered, as all accused do in
general, and therefore he pursued, with his mechanical and stupid
self-possession,--

“very well. and your age?”

again quasimodo made no reply to this question. the judge supposed that
it had been replied to, and continued,--

“now, your profession?”

still the same silence. the spectators had begun, meanwhile, to whisper
together, and to exchange glances.

“that will do,” went on the imperturbable auditor, when he supposed that
the accused had finished his third reply. “you are accused before us,
_primo_, of nocturnal disturbance; _secundo_, of a dishonorable act
of violence upon the person of a foolish woman,

 _in proejudicium
meretricis; tertio_, of rebellion and disloyalty towards the archers
of the police of our lord, the king. explain yourself upon all these
points.---clerk, have you written down what the prisoner has said thus
far?”

at this unlucky question, a burst of laughter rose from the clerk’s
table caught by the audience, so violent, so wild, so contagious, so
universal, that the two deaf men were forced to perceive it. quasimodo
turned round, shrugging his hump with disdain, while master florian,
equally astonished, and supposing that the laughter of the spectators
had been provoked by some irreverent reply from the accused, rendered
visible to him by that shrug of the shoulders, apostrophized him
indignantly,--

“you have uttered a reply, knave, which deserves the halter. do you know
to whom you are speaking?”

this sally was not fitted to arrest the explosion of general merriment.
it struck all as so whimsical, a

nd so ridiculous, that the wild laughter
even attacked the sergeants of the parloi-aux-bourgeois, a sort of
pikemen, whose stupidity was part of their uniform. quasimodo alone
preserved his seriousness, for the good reason that he understood
nothing of what was going on around him. the judge, more and more
irritated, thought it his duty to continue in the same tone, hoping
thereby to strike the accused with a terror which should react upon the
audience, and bring it back to respect.

“so this is as much as to say, perverse and thieving knave that you are,
that you permit yourself to be lacking in respect towards the auditor
of the châtelet, to the magistrate

 and inferior court of

there is no reason why a deaf man talking to a deaf man should stop.
god knows where and when master florian would have landed, when thus
launched at full speed in lofty eloquence, if the low door at the
extreme end of the room had not suddenly opened, and given entrance
to the provost in person. at his entrance master florian did not stop
short, but, making a half-turn on his heels, and aiming at the provost
the harangue with which he had been withering quasimodo a moment
before,--

“monseigneur,” said he, “i demand such penalty as you shall deem fitting
against the prisoner here present, for grave and aggravated offence
against the court.”

and he seated himself, utterly breathless, wiping away the great
drops of sweat which fell from his brow and drenched, like tears, the
parchments spread out before him. messire robert d’estouteville frowned
and made a gesture so imperious and significant to quasimodo, that the
deaf man in some measure unde

rstood it.

the provost addressed him with severity, “what have you done that you
have been brought hither, knave?”

the poor fellow, supposing that the provost was asking his name, broke
the silence which he habitually preserved, and replied, in a harsh and
guttural voice, “quasimodo.”

the reply matched the question so little that the wild laugh began to
circulate once more, and messire robert exclaimed, red with wrath,--

“are you mocking me also, you arrant knave?”

“bellringer of notre-dame,” replied quasimodo, supposing that what was
required of him was to explain to the judge who he was.

“bellringer!” interpolated the provost, who had waked up early enough to
be in a sufficiently bad temper, as we have said, not to require to have
his fury inflamed by s

uch strange responses. “bellringer! i’ll play you
a chime of rods on your back through the squares of paris! do you hear,
knave?”

“if it is my age that you wish to know,” said quasimodo, “i think that i
shall be twenty at saint martin’s day.”

this was too much; the provost could no longer restrain himself.

“ah! you are scoffing at the provostship, wretch! messieurs the
sergeants of the mace, you will take me this knave to the pillory of the
grève, you will flog him, and turn him for an hour. he shall pay me for
it, _tête dieu_! and i order that the present judgment shall be cried,
with the assistance of four sworn trumpeters, in the seven castellanies
of the viscom

ty of paris.”

the clerk set to work incontinently to draw up the account of the
sentence.

“_ventre dieu_! ‘tis well adjudged!” cried the little scholar, jehan
frollo du moulin, from his corner.

the provost turned and fixed his flashing eyes once more on quasimodo.
“i believe the knave said ‘_ventre dieu_’ clerk, add twelve deniers
parisian for the oath, and let the vestry of saint eustache have the
half of it; i have a particular devotion for saint eustache.”

in a few minutes the sentence was drawn up. its tenor was simple and
brief. the customs of the provostship and the viscomty had not yet
been worked over by president thibaut baillet, and by roger barmne, the
king’s advocate; they had not been obstructed, at that time, by that
lofty hedge

xplicit. one went straight to the point then, and at the
end of every path there was immediately visible, without thickets and
without turnings; the wheel, the gibbet, or the pillory. one at least
knew whither one was going.

the clerk presented the sentence to the provost, who affixed his seal to
it, and departed to pursue his round of the audience hall, in a frame
of mind which seemed destined to fill all the jails in paris that day.
jehan frollo and robin poussepain laughed in their sleeves. quasimodo
gazed on the whole with an indifferent and astonished air.

however, at the moment when master florian barbedienne was reading the
sentence in his turn, before signing it, the clerk felt himself moved
with pity for the poor wretch of a prisoner, and, in the hope of
obtaining some mitigation of the penalty, he approached as near the
auditor’s ear as possible, and said, pointing to quasimodo, “that man is
deaf.”

he hoped that this community of infirmity would awaken master florian’s

have already observed that master florian did not care to have his
deafness noticed. in the next place, he was so hard of hearing that he
did not catch a single word of what the clerk said to him; nevertheless,
he wished to have the appearance of hearing, and replied, “ah! ah! that
is different; i did not know that. an hour more of the pillory, in that
case.”

and he signed the sentence thus modified.

“‘tis well done,” said robin poussepain, who cherished a grudge against
quasimodo. “that will teach him to handle people roughly.”

the reader must permit us to take him back to the place de grève, which
we quitted yesterday with gringoire, in order to follow la esmeralda.

it is ten o’clock in the morning; everything is indicative of the day
after a festival. the pavement is covered with rubbish; ribbons, rags,
feathers from tufts of plumes, drops of wax from the torches, crumbs of

the victim finally arrived, bound to the tail of a cart, and when he had
been hoisted upon the platform, where he could be seen from all points
of the place, bound with cords and straps upon the wheel of the pillory,
a prodigious hoot, mingled with laughter and acclamations, burst forth
upon the place. they had recognized quasimodo.

it was he, in fact. the change was singular. pilloried on the very place
where, on the day before, he had been saluted, acclaimed, and proclaimed
pope and prince of fools, in the cortege of the duke of egypt, the king
of thunes, and the emperor of galilee! one thing is certain, and that
is, that there was not a soul in the crowd, not even himself, though in
turn triumphant and the sufferer, who set forth this combination clearly
in his thought. gringoire and his philosophy were missing at thi

spectacle.

soon michel noiret, sworn trumpeter to the king, our lord, imposed
silence on the louts, and proclaimed the sentence, in accordance with
the order and command of monsieur the provost. then he withdrew behind
the cart, with his men in livery surcoats.

quasimodo, impassible, did not wince. all resistance had been rendered
impossible to him by what was then called, in the style of the criminal
chancellery, “the vehemence and firmness of the bonds” which means that
the thongs and chains probably cut into his flesh; moreover, it is a
tradition of jail and wardens, which has not been lost, and which the
handcuffs still preciously preserve among us, a civilized, gentle,
humane people (the galleys and the guillotine in parentheses).

he had allowed himse

gled him under a fresh system
of thongs and buckles; he allowed them to bind and buckle him. only from
time to time he snorted noisily, like a calf whose head is hanging and
bumping over the edge of a butcher’s cart.

“the dolt,” said jehan frollo of the mill, to his friend robin
poussepain (for the two students had followed the culprit, as was to
have been expected), “he understands no more than a cockchafer shut up
in a box!”

there was wild laughter among the crowd when they beheld quasimodo’s
hump, his camel’s breast, his callous and hairy shoulders laid bare.
during this gayety, a man in the livery of the city, short of stature
and robust of mien, mounted the platform and placed himself near the
victim. his name speedily circulated among the spectators. it was master
pierrat torterue, official torturer to the châtelet.

he began by depositing on an angle of the pillory a black hour-glass,
the upper lobe of which was filled with red sand, which it allowed
to glide into the lo

re became visible, suspended from his right hand, a
thin and tapering whip of long, white, shining, knotted, plaited thongs,
armed with metal nails. with his left hand, he negligently folded back
his shirt around his right arm, to the very armpit.

in the meantime, jehan frollo, elevating his curly blonde head above
the crowd (he had mounted upon the shoulders of robin poussepain for the
purpose), shouted: “come and look, gentle ladies and men! they are
going to peremptorily flagellate master quasimodo, the bellringer of
my brother, monsieur the archdeacon of josas, a knave of oriental
architecture, who has a back like a dome, and legs like twisted
columns!”

and the crowd burst into a laugh, especially the boys and young girls.

at length the torturer stamped his foot. the wheel began to turn.
quasimodo wavered beneath his bonds. the amazement which was suddenly
depicted upon his deformed face caused the bursts of laughter to
redouble around him.

all at once, at the moment when the wheel

in its revolution presented to
master pierrat, the humped back of quasimodo, master pierrat raised his
arm; the fine thongs whistled sharply through the air, like a handful of
adders, and fell with fury upon the wretch’s shoulders.

quasimodo leaped as though awakened with a start. he began to
understand. he writhed in his bonds; a violent contraction of surprise
and pain distorted the muscles of his face, but he uttered not a single
sigh. he merely turned his head backward, to the right, then to the
left, balancing it as a bull does who has been stung in the flanks by a
gadfly.

a second blow followed the first, then a third, and another and another,
and still others. the wheel did not cease to turn, nor the blows to rain
down.

on the blood burst forth, and could be seen trickling in a thousand
threads down the hunchback’s black shoulders; and the slender thongs, in
their rotatory motion which rent the air, sprinkled drops of it upon the
crowd.

quasimodo had resumed, to all appearance, his first imperturbability. he
had at first tried, in a quiet way and without much outward movement,
to break his bonds. his eye had been seen to light up, his muscles
to stiffen, his members to concentrate their force, and the straps
to stretch. the effort was powerful, prodigious, desperate; but the
provost’s seasoned bonds resisted. they cracked, and that was all.
quasimodo fell back exhausted. amazement gave way, on his features, to
a sentiment of profound

hich did not cease to flow, nor
the blows which redoubled in fury, nor the wrath of the torturer, who
grew excited himself and intoxicated with the execution, nor the sound
of the horrible thongs, more sharp and whistling than the claws of
scorpions.

at length a bailiff from the châtelet clad in black, mounted on a black
horse, who had been stationed beside the ladder since the beginning
of the execution, extended his ebony wand towards the hour-glass. the
torturer stopped. the wheel stopped. quasimodo’s eye opened slowly.

the scourging was finished. two lackeys of the official torturer bathed
the bleeding shoulders of the patient, anointed them with some unguent
which immediately closed all the wounds, and threw upon his back a sort
of yellow vestment, in cut like a chasuble. in the meanwhile, pierrat
torterue allowed the thongs, red and gorged with blood, to drip upon the
pavement.

all was not over for quasimodo. he had still to undergo that hour of
pillory which master florian barbedie

so the hour-glass was turned over once more, and they left the hunchback
fastened to the plank, in order that justice might be accomplished to
the very end.

the populace, especially in the middle ages, is in society what the
child is in the family. as long as it remains in its state of primitive
ignorance, of moral and intellectual minority, it can be said of it as
of the child,--


   ‘tis the pitiless age.


we have already shown that quasimodo was generally hated, for more than
one good reason, it is true. there was hardly a spectator in that crowd
who had not or who did not believe that he had reason to complain of the
malevolent hunchback of notre-dame. the joy at seeing him appear thus
in the pillory had been universal; and the harsh punishment which he had
just suffered, and the pitiful condition in which it had left him, far
from softening the populace had rendered its hatred more malicious by
arming it with a touch of mirth.

one-eyed creature! the hunch-back! the monster!”

“a face to make a woman miscarry better than all the drugs and

and the two scholars, jehan du moulin, and robin poussepain, sang at the
top of their lungs, the ancient refrain,--


   “_une hart
   pour le pendard!
   un fagot
   pour le magot_!”*


     *  a rope for the gallows bird!  a fagot for the ape.


a thousand other insults rained down upon him, and hoots and
imprecations, and laughter, and now and then, stones.

quasimodo was deaf but his sight was clear, and the public fury was
no less energetically depicted on their visages than in their words.
moreover, the blows from the stones explained the bursts of laughter.

at first he held his ground. but little by little that patience which
had borne up under the lash of the torturer, yielded and gave way before
all these stings of insects. the bull of the asturias who has been but

 it was like the arrival of a saviour, which the
unhappy man was greeting. but as soon as the mule was near enough to the
pillory to allow of its rider recognizing the victim, the priest dropped
his eyes, beat a hasty retreat, spurred on rigorously, as though in
haste to rid himself of humiliating appeals, and not at all desirous of
being saluted and recognized by a poor fellow in such a predicament.

this priest was archdeacon dom claude frollo.

the cloud descended more blackly than ever upon quasimodo’s brow. the
smile was still mingled with it for a time, but was bitter, discouraged,
profoundly sad.

time passed on. he had been there at least an hour and a half,
lacerated, maltreated, mocked incessantly, and almost stoned.

all at once he moved again in his chains with redoubled despair, which

silence which he had obstinately preserved hitherto, he cried in a
hoarse and furious voice, which resembled a bark rather than a hu

than pitiable, with his face purple
and dripping, his eye wild, his mouth foaming with rage and pain, and
his tongue lolling half out. it must also be stated that if a charitable
soul of a bourgeois or _bourgeoise_, in the rabble, had attempted to
carry a glass of water to that wretched creature in torment, there
reigned around the infamous steps of the pillory such a prejudice of
shame and ignominy, that it would have sufficed to repulse the good
samaritan.

at the expiration of a few moments, quasimodo cast a desperate glance
upon the crowd, and repeated in a voice still more heartrending:
“drink!”

and all began to laugh.

“drink this!” cried robin poussepain, throwing in his face a sponge
which had been soaked in the gutter. “there, you deaf villain, i’m your
debtor.”

a woman hurled a stone at his head,--

“that will teach you to wake us up at night with your peal of a dammed
soul.”

“he, good, my son!” howled a cripple, making an effort to reach him with
his crutch,

“will you cast any more spells on us from the top of the
towers of notre-dame?”

“here’s a drinking cup!” chimed in a man, flinging a broken jug at his
breast. “‘twas you that made my wife, simply because she passed near
you, give birth to a child with two heads!”

“and my cat bring forth a kitten with six paws!” yelped an old crone,
launching a brick at him.

“drink!” repeated quasimodo panting, and for the third time.

at that moment he beheld the crowd give way. a young girl, fantastically
dressed, emerged from the throng. she was accompanied by a little white
goat with gilded horns, and carried a tambourine in her hand.

quasimodo’s eyes sparkled. it was the gypsy whom he had attempted to
carry off on the preceding night, a misdeed for which he was dimly
conscious that he was being punished at that very moment; which was
not in the least the case, since he was being chast

raised it gently to the parched lips of the miserable man.

then, from that eye which had been, up to that moment, so dry and
burning, a big tear was seen to fall, and roll slowly down that deformed
visage so long contracted with despair. it was the first, in all
probability, that the unfortunate man had ever shed.

meanwhile, he had forgotten to drink. the gypsy made her little pout,
from impatience, and pressed the spout to the tusked month of quasimodo,
with a smile.

he drank with deep draughts. his thirst was burning.

when he had finished, the wretch protruded his black lips, no doubt,
with the object of kissing the beautiful hand which had just succoured
him. but the young girl, who was, perhaps, somewhat distrustful, and who
remembered the violent attempt of the night, withdrew her hand with the
frightened gesture of a child who is afraid of being bitten by a beast.

la esmeralda turned pale and descended from the pillory, staggering as
she went. the voice of the recluse still pursued her,--

“descend! descend! thief of egypt! thou shalt ascend it once more!”

“the sacked nun is in one of her tantrums,” muttered the populace;
and that was the end of it. for that sort of woman was feared; which
rendered them sacred. people did not then willingly attack one who
prayed day and night.

the hour had arrived for removing quasimodo. he was unbound, the crowd
dispersed.

near the grand pont, mahiette, who was returning with her two
companions, suddenly halted,--

“by the way, eustache! what did you do with that cake?”

“mother,” said the child, “while you were talking with that lady in the
bole, a big dog took a bite of my cake, and then i bit it also.”

“what, sir, did you eat the whole of it?” she went on.

“mother, it was the dog. i told him, but he would not listen to me. then
i bit into it, also.”

many weeks had elapsed.

the first of march had arrived. the sun, which dubartas, that classic
ancestor of periphrase, had not yet dubbed the “grand-duke of candles,”
 was none the less radiant and joyous on that account. it was one of
those spring days which possesses so much sweetness and beauty, that all
paris turns out into the squares and promenades and celebrates them

caught sight of this stranger, his
attention seemed divided between him and the dancer, and his face became
more and more gloomy. all at once he rose upright, and a quiver ran
through his whole body: “who is that man?” he muttered between his
teeth: “i have always seen her alone before!”

then he plunged down beneath the tortuous vault of the spiral staircase,
and once more descended. as he passed the door of the bell chamber,
which was ajar, he saw something which struck him; he beheld quasimodo,
who, leaning through an opening of one of those slate penthouses which
resemble enormous blinds, appeared also to be gazing at the place. he
was engaged in so profound a contemplation, that he did not notice the
passage of his adopted father. his savage eye had a singular expression;
it was a charmed, tender look. “this is strange!” murmured claude. “is
it the gypsy at whom he is thus gazing?” he continued his descent. at
the end of a few minutes, the anxious archdeacon entered upon th

“go to the devil!” cried the priest, with a terrible look; and, giving
the amazed gringoire a push on the shoulders, he plunged, with long
strides, under the gloomiest arcades of the cathedral.




chapter iii. the bells.



after the morning in the pillory, the neighbors of notre-dame thought
they noticed that quasimodo’s ardor for ringing had grown cool.
formerly, there had been peals for every occasion, long morning
serenades, which lasted from prime to compline; peals from the belfry
for a high mass, rich scales drawn over the smaller bells for a wedding,
for a christening, and mingling in the air like a rich embroidery of all
sorts of charming sounds. the old church, all vibrating and sonorous,
was in a perpetual joy of bells. one was constantly conscious of the
presence of a spirit of noise and caprice,
 
 ___________________________
 
 who sang through all those
mouths of brass. now that spirit seemed to have departed; the cathedral
seemed gloomy, and gladly remained silent; festivals and funerals had
the simple peal, dry and bare, demanded by the ritual, nothing more. of
the double noise which constitutes a church, the organ within, the bell
without, the organ alone remained. one would have said that there was
no longer a musician in the belfry. quasimodo was always there,
nevertheless; what, then, had happened to him? was it that the shame and
despair of the pillory still lingered in the bottom of his heart, that
the lashes of his tormentor’s whip reverberated unendingly in his soul,
and that the sadness of such treatment had wholly extinguished in him
even his passion for the bells? or was it that marie had a rival in the
heart of the bellringer of notre-dame, and that the great bell and her
fourteen sisters were neglected for something more

 amiable and more
beautiful?

it chanced that, in the year of grace 1482, annunciation day fell on
tuesday, the twenty-fifth of march. that day the air was so pure and
light that quasimodo felt some returning affection for his bells. he
therefore ascended the northern tower while the beadle below was opening
wide the doors of the church, which were then enormous panels of stout
wood, covered with leather, bordered with nails of gilded iron, and
framed in carvings “very artistically elaborated.”

on arriving in the lofty bell chamber, quasimodo gazed for some time
at the six bells and shook his head sadly, as though groaning over some
foreign element which had interposed itsel

amulet in glass which might serve to bestow, in the guise of a trinket,
on isabeau la thierrye, finally pushed open the door which his brother
had left unfastened, as a last indulgence, and which he, in his
turn, left open as a last piece of malice, and descended the circular
staircase, skipping like a bird.

in the midst of the gloom of the spiral staircase, he elbowed something
which drew aside with a growl; he took it for granted that it was
quasimodo, and it struck him as so droll that he descended the remainder
of the staircase holding his sides with laughter. on emerging upon the
place, he laughed yet more heartily.

he stamped his foot when he found himself on the ground once again.
“oh!” said he, “good and honorable pavement of paris, cursed staircase,

rom a roof, knock them down with
two enormous fists, pick up the gypsy with one hand, as a child would
her doll, and dash back into the church with a single bound, lifting the
young girl above his head and crying in a formidable voice,--

“sanctuary!”

this was done with such rapidity, that had it taken place at night,
the whole of it could have been seen in the space of a single flash of
lightning.

“sanctuary! sanctuary!” repeated the crowd; and the clapping of ten
thousand hands made quasimodo’s single eye sparkle with joy and pride.

this shock restored the condemned girl to her senses. she raised her
eyelids, looked at quasimodo, then closed them again suddenly, as though
terrified by her deliverer.

charmolue was stupefied, as well as the executioners and the entire
escort. in fact, within the bounds of notre-dame, the condemned girl
could not be touched. the cathedral was a place of refuge. all temporal
jurisdiction expired upon its threshold.

quasimodo had halted beneath the

r hands than his. there were
moments when he looked as if not daring to touch her, even with his
breath. then, all at once, he would press her forcibly in his arms,
against his angular bosom, like his own possession, his treasure, as
the mother of that child would have done. his gnome’s eye, fastened upon
her, inundated her with tenderness, sadness, and pity, and was suddenly
raised filled with lightnings. then the women laughed and wept, the
crowd stamped with enthusiasm, for, at that moment quasimodo had a
beauty of his own. he was handsome; he, that orphan, that foundling,
that outcast, he felt himself august and strong, he gazed in the face
of that society from which he was banished, and in which he had so
powerfully intervened, of that human justice from which he had wrenched
its prey, of all those tigers whose jaws were forced to remain empty, of
those policemen, those judges, those executioners, of all that force of
the king which he, the meanest of creatures, had just broken, with the

force of god.

and then, it was touching to behold this protection which had fallen
from a being so hideous upon a being so unhappy, a creature condemned to
death saved by quasimodo. they were two extremes of natural and social
wretchedness, coming into contact and aiding each other.

meanwhile, after several moments of triumph, quasimodo had plunged
abruptly into the church with his burden. the populace, fond of all
prowess, sought him with their eyes, beneath the gloomy nave, regretting
that he had so speedily disappeared from their acclamations. all at
once, he was seen to re-appear at one of the extremities of the gallery
of the kings of france; he traversed it, running like a madman, raising
his conquest high in his arms and shouting: “sanctuary!” the crowd broke
forth into fresh applause. the gallery passed, he plunged

gave way beneath him, and he sank upon the pavement, thinking of her who
had died that day. he felt so many monstrous vapors pass and discharge
themselves in his brain, that it seemed to him that his head had become
one of the chimneys of hell.

it would appear that he remained a long time in this attitude, no longer
thinking, overwhelmed and passive beneath the hand of the demon. at
length some strength returned to him; it occurred to him to take refuge
in his tower beside his faithful quasimodo. he rose; and, as he was
afraid, he took the lamp from the breviary to light his way. it was a
sacrilege; but he had got beyond heeding such a trifle now.

he slowly climbed the stairs of the towers, filled with a secret fright
which must have been communicated to the rare passers-by in the place
du parvis by the mysterious light of his lamp, mounting so late from
loophole to loophole of the bell tower.

all at once, he felt a freshness on his face, and found himself at the
door of the highest

las flamel caused to be built on the vaults of
saint-jacques de la boucherie, a chamber which cost him four livres six
sous, sixteen farthings, parisis.

at notre-dame it was a tiny cell situated on the roof of the side aisle,
beneath the flying buttresses, precisely at the spot where the wife of
the present janitor of the towers has made for herself a garden, which
is to the hanging gardens of babylon what a lettuce is to a palm-tree,
what a porter’s wife is to a semiramis.

it was here that quasimodo had deposited la esmeralda, after his wild
and triumphant course. as long as that course lasted, the young girl
had been unable to recover her senses, half unconscious, half awake, no
longer feeling anything, except that she was mounting through the air,
floating in it, flying in it, that something was raising her above the
earth. from time to time she heard the loud laughter, the noisy voice
of quasimodo in her ear; she half opened her eyes; then below her she
confusedly beheld paris checkered

 with its thousand roofs of slate and
tiles, like a red and blue mosaic, above her head the frightful and
joyous face of quasimodo. then her eyelids drooped again; she thought
that all was over, that they had executed her during her swoon, and that
the misshapen spirit which had presided over her destiny, had laid hold
of her and was bearing her away. she dared not look at him, and she
surrendered herself to her fate. but when the bellringer, dishevelled
and panting, had deposited her in the cell of refuge, when she felt his
huge hands gently detaching the cord which bruised her arms, she felt
that sort of shock which awak

ens with a start the passengers of a vessel
which runs aground in the middle of a dark night. her thoughts
awoke also, and returned to her one by one. she saw that she was in
notre-dame; she remembered having been torn from the hands of the
executioner; that phoebus was alive, that phoebus loved her no longer;
and as these two ideas, one of which shed so much bitterness over the
other, presented themselves simultaneously to the poor condemned girl;
she turned to quasimodo, who was standing in front of her, and who
terrified her; she said to him,--“why have you saved me?”

he gazed at her with anxiety, as though seeking to divine what she was
saying to him. she repeated her question. then he gave her a profoundly
sorrowful glance and fled. she was astonished.

a few moments later he returned, bearing a package which he cast at
her feet. it was clothing which some charitable women had left on the
threshold of the church for her.

then she dropped her eyes upon

 herself and saw that she was almost
naked, and blushed. life had returned.

quasimodo appeared to experience something of this modesty. he covered
his eyes with his large hand and retired once more, but slowly.

she made haste to dress herself. the robe was a white one with a white
veil,--the garb of a novice of the hôtel-dien.

she had barely finished when she beheld quasimodo returning. he carried
a basket under one arm and a mattress under the other. in the basket
there was a bottle, bread, and some provisions. he set the basket on the
floor and said, “eat!” he spread the mattress on the flagging and said,
“sleep.”

it was his own repast, it was his own bed, which the bellringer had gone
in search of.

the gypsy raised her eyes to thank him, but she could not articulate a
word. she dropped her head with a quiver of terror.

then he said to her.--

a foundling, condemned to death, an unhappy creature, without country,
without family, without a hearthstone.

at the moment when the thought of her isolation thus appeared to her
more poignant than ever, she felt a bearded and hairy head glide between
her hands, upon her knees. she started (everything alarmed her now) and
looked. it was the poor goat, the agile djali, which had made its escape
after her, at the moment when quasimodo had put to flight charmolue’s
brigade, and which had been lavishing caresses on her feet for nearly
an hour past, without being able to win a glance. the gypsy covered him
with kisses.

“oh! djali!” she said, “how i have forgotten thee! and so thou still
thinkest of me! oh! thou art not an ingrate!”

at the same time, as though an invisible hand had lifted the weight
which had repressed her tears in her heart for so long, she began to
weep, and, in proportion as her tears flowed, she

chapter iii. deaf.



on the following morning, she perceived on awaking, that she had
been asleep. this singular thing astonished her. she had been so long
unaccustomed to sleep! a joyous ray of the rising sun entered through
her window and touched her face. at the same time with the sun, she
beheld at that window an object which frightened her, the unfortunate
face of quasimodo. she involuntarily closed her eyes again, but in vain;
she fancied that she still saw through the rosy lids that gnome’s mask,
one-eyed and gap-toothed. then, while she still kept her eyes closed,
she heard a rough voice saying, very gently,--

“be not afraid. i am your friend. i came to watch you sleep. it does not
hurt you if i come to see you sleep, does it? what difference does it
make to you if i am here when your eyes are closed! now i am going.
stay, i have placed myself behind the w

 you can open your eyes
again.”

there was something more plaintive than these words, and that was the
accent in which they were uttered. the gypsy, much touched, opened
her eyes. he was, in fact, no longer at the window. she approached the
opening, and beheld the poor hunchback crouching in an angle of the
wall, in a sad and resigned attitude. she made an effort to surmount the
repugnance with which he inspired her. “come,” she said to him gently.
from the movement of the gypsy’s lips, quasimodo thought that she
was driving him away; then he rose and retired limping, slowly, with
drooping head, without even daring to raise to the young girl his gaze
full of despair. “do come,” she cried, but he continued to retreat. then
she darted from her cell, ran to him, and grasped his arm. on feeling
her touch him, quasimodo trembled in every limb. he raised his suppliant
eye, and seeing that she was leading him back to her quarters, his whole
face beamed with joy and tenderness. she tried to
 
 ___________________________
 
 make him enter the
cell; but he persisted in remaining on the threshold. “no, no,” said he;
“the owl enters not the nest of the lark.”

then she crouched down gracefully on her couch, with her goat asleep at
her feet. both remained motionless for several moments, considering
in silence, she so much grace, he so much ugliness. every moment she
discovered some fresh deformity in quasimodo. her glance travelled from
his knock knees to his humped back, from his humped back to his only
eye. she could not comprehend the existence of a being so awkwardly
fashioned. yet there was so much sadness and so much gentleness spread
over all this, that she began to become reconciled to it.

he was the first to break the silence. “so you were telling me to
return?”

she made an affirmative sign of the head, and said, “yes.”

he understood the motion of the head. “alas!” he said, as

inward wounds closed, her grace and beauty blossomed
once more on her countenance, but more thoughtful, more reposeful. her
former character also returned to her, somewhat even of her gayety, her
pretty pout, her love for her goat, her love for singing, her modesty.
she took care to dress herself in the morning in the corner of her
cell for fear some inhabitants of the neighboring attics might see her
through the window.

when the thought of phoebus left her time, the gypsy sometimes thought
of quasimodo. he was the sole bond, the sole connection, the sole
communication which remained to her with men, with the living.
unfortunate girl! she was more outside the world than quasimodo. she
understood not in the least the strange friend whom chance had given
her. she often reproached herself for not feeling a gratitude which
should close her eyes, but decidedly, she could not accustom herself to
the poor bellringer. he was too ugly.

she had left the whistle which he had given her lying on the groun

this did not prevent quasimodo from making his appearance from time to
time during the first few days. she did her best not to turn aside with
too much repugnance when he came to bring her her basket of provisions
or her jug of water, but he always perceived the slightest movement of
this sort, and then he withdrew sadly.

once he came at the moment when she was caressing djali. he stood
pensively for several minutes before this graceful group of the goat and
the gypsy; at last he said, shaking his heavy and ill-formed head,
 
 ___________________________
 
n, shook his head, and withdrew slowly, with
his brow in his hand, leaving the gypsy stupefied. among the grotesque
personages sculptured on the wall, there was one to whom he was
particularly attached, and with which he often seemed to exchange
fraternal glances. once the gypsy heard him saying to it,--

“oh! why am not i of stone, like you!”

at last, one morning, la esmeralda had advanced to the edge of the roof,
and was looking into the place over the pointed roof of saint-jean le
rond. quasimodo was standing behind her. he had placed himself in that
position in order to spare the young girl, as far as possible, the
displeasure of seeing him. all at once the gypsy started, a tear and a
flash of joy gleamed simultaneously in her eyes, she knelt on the
brink of the roof and extended her arms towards the place with anguish,
exclaiming: “phoebus! come! come! a word, a single word in the name of
heaven! phoebus! phoebus!” her voice, her face, her gesture, her whole
person bore the heartr

ending expression of a shipwrecked man who is
making a signal of distress to the joyous vessel which is passing afar
off in a ray of sunlight on the horizon.

quasimodo leaned over the place, and saw that the object of this tender
and agonizing prayer was a young man, a captain, a handsome cavalier
all glittering with arms and decorations, prancing across the end of the
place, and saluting with his plume a beautiful lady who was smiling at
him from her balcony. however, the officer did not hear the unhappy girl
calling him; he was too far away.

but the poor deaf man heard. a profound sigh heaved his breast; he
turned round; his heart was swollen with all the

o longer saw anything except the handsome
horse hitched at the door of the gondelaurier house; the captain had
just entered there.

he raised his eyes to the roof of the church. la esmeralda was there
in the same spot, in the same attitude. he made her a sad sign with his
head; then he planted his back against one of the stone posts of the
gondelaurier porch, determined to wait until the captain should come
forth.

in the gondelaurier house it was one of those gala days which precede
a wedding. quasimodo beheld many people enter, but no one come out. he
cast a glance towards the roof from time to time; the gypsy did not stir
any more than himself. a groom came and unhitched the horse and led it
to the stable of the house.

the entire day passed thus, quasimodo at his post, la esmeralda on the
roof, phoebus, no doubt, at the feet of fleur-de-lys.

at length night came, a moonless night, a dark night. quasimodo
fixed his gaze in vain upon la esmeralda; soon she was no more than
a whiteness amid t

he twilight; then nothing. all was effaced, all was
black.

quasimodo beheld the front windows from top to bottom of the
gondelaurier mansion illuminated; he saw the other casements in the
place lighted one by one, he also saw them extinguished to the very
last, for he remained the whole evening at his post. the officer did not
come forth. when the last passers-by had returned home, when the windows
of all the other houses were extinguished, quasimodo was left entirely
alone, entirely in the dark. there were at that time no lamps in the
square before notre-dame.

meanwhile, the windows of the gondelaurier mansion remained lighted,
even after midnight. quasimodo, motionless and attentive, beheld a
throng of lively, dancing shadows pass athwart the many-colored
painted panes. had he not been deaf, he would have heard more and more
distinctly, in proportion as the noise of sleeping paris died away, a
sound of feasting, laughter, and music in th

e gondelaurier mansion.

towards one o’clock in the morning, the guests began to take their
leave. quasimodo, shrouded in darkness watched them all pass out through
the porch illuminated with torches. none of them was the captain.

he was filled with sad thoughts; at times he looked upwards into the
air, like a person who is weary of waiting. great black clouds, heavy,
torn, split, hung like crape hammocks beneath the starry dome of night.
one would have pronounced them spiders’ webs of the vault of heaven.

in one of these moments he suddenly beheld the long window on the
balcony, whose stone balus

trade projected above his head, open
mysteriously. the frail glass door gave passage to two persons, and
closed noiselessly behind them; it was a man and a woman.

it was not without difficulty that quasimodo succeeded in recognizing
in the man the handsome captain, in the woman the young lady whom he
had seen welcome the officer in the morning from that very balcony. the
place was perfectly dark, and a double crimson curtain which had fallen
across the door the very moment it closed again, allowed no light to
reach the balcony from the apartment.

the young man and the young girl, so far as our deaf man could judge,
without hearing a single one of their words, appeared to abandon
themselves to a ve

ry tender tête-a-tête. the young girl seemed to have
allowed the officer to make a girdle for her of his arm, and gently
repulsed a kiss.

quasimodo looked on from below at this scene which was all the more
pleasing to witness because it was not meant to be seen. he contemplated
with bitterness that beauty, that happiness. after all, nature was not
dumb in the poor fellow, and his human sensibility, all maliciously
contorted as it was, quivered no less than any other. he thought of the
miserable portion which providence had allotted to him; that woman and
the pleasure of love, would pass forever before his eyes, and that he
should never do

ed indignation
with his anger, was the thought of what the gypsy would suffer could she
behold it. it is true that the night was very dark, that la esmeralda,
if she had remained at her post (and he had no doubt of this), was very
far away, and that it was all that he himself could do to distinguish
the lovers on the balcony. this consoled him.

meanwhile, their conversation grew more and more animated. the young
lady appeared to be entreating the officer to ask nothing more of her.
of all this quasimodo could distinguish only the beautiful clasped
hands, the smiles mingled with tears, the young girl’s glances directed
to the stars, the eyes of the captain lowered ardently upon her.

fortunately, for the young girl was beginning to resist but feebly, the
door of the balcony suddenly opened once more and an old dame appeared;
the beauty seemed confused, the officer assumed an air of displeasure,
and all three withdrew.

a moment later, a horse was champing his bit under the porch, and the

liant officer, enveloped in his night cloak, passed rapidly before
quasimodo.

the bellringer allowed him to turn the corner of the street, then he ran
after him with his ape-like agility, shouting: “hey there! captain!”

the captain halted.

“what wants this knave with me?” he said, catching sight through the
gloom of that hipshot form which ran limping after him.

meanwhile, quasimodo had caught up with him, and had boldly grasped his
horse’s bridle: “follow me, captain; there is one here who desires to
speak with you!

“_cornemahom_!” grumbled phoebus, “here’s a villanous; ruffled bird
which i fancy i have seen somewhere. holà master, will you let my
horse’s bridle alone?”

“captain,” replied the deaf man, “do you not ask me who it is?”

“i tell you to release my horse,” retorted phoebus, impatiently. “what
means the knave by clinging to the b

ridle of my steed? do you take my
horse for a gallows?”

quasimodo, far from releasing the bridle, prepared to force him to
retrace his steps. unable to comprehend the captain’s resistance, he
hastened to say to him,--

“come, captain, ‘tis a woman who is waiting for you.” he added with an
effort: “a woman who loves you.”

“a rare rascal!” said the captain, “who thinks me obliged to go to all
the women who love me! or who say they do. and what if, by chance, she
should resemble you, you face of a screech-owl? tell the woman who has
sent you t

hat i am about to marry, and that she may go to the devil!”

“listen,” exclaimed quasimodo, thinking to overcome his hesitation with
a word, “come, monseigneur! ‘tis the gypsy whom you know!”

this word did, indeed, produce a great effect on phoebus, but not of the
kind which the deaf man expected. it will be remembered that our gallant
officer had retired with fleur-de-lys several moments before quasimodo
had rescued the condemned girl from the hands of charmolue. afterwards,
in all his visits to the gondelaurier mansion he had taken care not to
mention that woman, the memory of whom was, after all, painful to him;
and on her side, fleur-de-lys had not deemed it politic to tell him that
the gypsy was alive. hence phoebus believed poor “similar” to be dead,
and that a month or two had elapsed since her death. let us add that
for the last few moments the captain had been reflecting on the prof

darkness of the night, the supernatural ugliness, the sepulchral voice
of the strange messenger; that it was past midnight; that the street was
deserted, as on the evening when the surly monk had accosted him; and
that his horse snorted as it looked at quasimodo.

“the gypsy!” he exclaimed, almost frightened. “look here, do you come
from the other world?”

and he laid his hand on the hilt of his dagger.

“quick, quick,” said the deaf man, endeavoring to drag the horse along;
“this way!”

phoebus dealt him a vigorous kick in the breast.

quasimodo’s eye flashed. he made a motion to fling himself on the
captain. then he drew himself up stiffly and said,--

“oh! how happy you are to have some one who loves you!”

he emphasized the wo

rds “some one,” and loosing the horse’s bridle,--

“begone!”

phoebus spurred on in all haste, swearing. quasimodo watched him
disappear in the shades of the street.

“oh!” said the poor deaf man, in a very low voice; “to refuse that!”

he re-entered notre-dame, lighted his lamp and climbed to the tower
again. the gypsy was still in the same place, as he had supposed.

she flew to meet him as far off as she could see him. “alone!” she
cried, clasping her beautiful hands sorrowfully.

“i could not find him,” said quasimodo coldly.

“you should have waited all night,” she said angrily.

ther than to have afflicted her. he had kept all the pain to
himself.

from that day forth, the gypsy no longer saw him. he ceased to come to
her cell. at the most she occasionally caught a glimpse at the summit of
the towers, of the bellringer’s face turned sadly to her. but as soon as
she perceived him, he disappeared.

we must admit that she was not much grieved by this voluntary absence
on the part of the poor hunchback. at the bottom of her heart she was
grateful to him for it. moreover, quasimodo did not deceive himself on
this point.

she no longer saw him, but she felt the presence of a good genius about
her. her provisions were replenished by an invisible hand during her
slumbers. one morning she found a cage of birds on her window. there
was a piece of sculpture above her window which frightened her. she had
shown this more than once in quasimodo’s presence. one morning, for
all these things happened at night, she no longer saw it, it had been
broken. the person who had climbed up

i know not whether it was done intentionally, but la esmeralda took the
faded nosegay and wore it all day long upon her breast.

that day she did not hear the voice singing in the tower.

she troubled herself very little about it. she passed her days in
caressing djali, in watching the door of the gondelaurier house, in
talking to herself about phoebus, and in crumbling up her bread for the
swallows.

she had entirely ceased to see or hear quasimodo. the poor bellringer
seemed to have disappeared from the church. one night, nevertheless,
when she was not asleep, but was thinking of her handsome captain, she
heard something breathing near her cell. she rose in alarm, and saw by
the light of the moon, a shapeless mass lying across her door on the
outside. it was quasimodo asleep there upon the stones.

claude did not open.

he passed whole days with his face close to the panes of his window.
from that window, situated in the cloister, he could see la esmeralda’s
chamber. he often saw herself with her goat, sometimes with quasimodo.
he remarked the little attentions of the ugly deaf man, his obedience,
his delicate and submissive ways with the gypsy. he recalled, for he had
a good memory, and memory is the tormentor of the jealous, he recalled
the singular look of the bellringer, bent on the dancer upon a certain
evening. he asked himself what motive could have impelled quasimodo to
save her. he was the witness of a thousand little scenes between the
gypsy and the deaf man, the pantomime of which, viewed from afar and

“there must be an end to this!” he said, gnashing his teeth.

she was conquered, palpitating in his arms, and in his power. she felt a
wanton hand straying over her. she made a last effort, and began to cry:
“help! help! a vampire! a vampire!”

nothing came. djali alone was awake and bleating with anguish.

“hush!” said the panting priest.

all at once, as she struggled and crawled on the floor, the gypsy’s hand
came in contact with something cold and metal-lic-it was quasimodo’s
whistle. she seized it with a convulsive hope, raised it to her lips and
blew with all the strength that she had left. the whistle gave a clear,
piercing sound.

“what is that?” said the priest.

almost at the same instant he felt himself raised by a vigorous arm. the
cell was dark; he could not distinguish clearly who it was that held
him thus; but he heard teeth chattering with rage, and there was just
sufficient light scattered among the gloom to allow him to see above his
head the b

lade of a large knife.

the priest fancied that he perceived the form of quasimodo. he assumed
that it could be no one but he. he remembered to have stumbled, as
he entered, over a bundle which was stretched across the door on the
outside. but, as the newcomer did not utter a word, he knew not what
to think. he flung himself on the arm which held the knife, crying:
“quasimodo!” he forgot, at that moment of distress, that quasimodo was
deaf.

in a twinkling, the priest was overthrown and a leaden knee rested on
his breast.

from the angular imprint of that knee he recognized quasimodo; but what
was to be done? how could he make the other recognize him? the darkness
rendered the deaf man blind.

he was lost. the young girl, pitiless as an enraged tigress, did not
intervene to save him. the knife was approaching his head; the
moment was critical. all at once, his adversary seemed stricken with
hesitation.

“no blood on he

r!” he said in a dull voice.

it was, in fact, quasimodo’s voice.

then the priest felt a large hand dragging him feet first out of the
cell; it was there that he was to die. fortunately for him, the moon had
risen a few moments before.

when they had passed through the door of the cell, its pale rays fell
upon the priest’s countenance. quasimodo looked him full in the face, a
trembling seized him, and he released the priest and shrank back.

the gypsy, who had advanced to the threshold of her cell, beheld
with surprise their roles abruptly changed. it was now the priest who
menaced, quasimodo who was the suppliant.

the priest, who was overwhelming the deaf man with gestures of wrath and
reproach, made the latter a violent sign to retire.

the deaf man dropped his head, then he came and knelt at the gypsy’s
door,--“monseigneur,”

he said, in a grave and resigned voice, “you shall
do all that you please afterwards, but kill me first.”

so saying, he presented his knife to the priest. the priest, beside
himself, was about to seize it. but the young girl was quicker than be;
she wrenched the knife from quasimodo’s hands and burst into a frantic
laugh,--“approach,” she said to the priest.

she held the blade high. the priest remained undecided.

she would certainly have struck him.

then she added with a pitiless expression, well aware that she was about
to pierce the priest’s heart with thousands of red-hot irons,--

“ah! i know that phoebus is not dead!”

the priest overturned quasimodo on the floor with a kick, and, quivering
with rage, darted back under the vault of the staircase.

he was gone, quasimodo picked up the whistle which had just saved
the gypsy.

“it was getting rusty,” he said, as he handed it back to her; then he
left her alone.

the young girl, deeply agitated by this violent scene, fell back
exhausted on her bed, and began to sob and weep. her horizon was
becoming gloomy once more.

the priest had groped his way back to his cell.

it was settled. dom claude was jealous of quasimodo!

he repeated with a thoughtful air his fatal words: “no one shall have

chapter i. gringoire has many good ideas in succession.--rue des
bernardins.



as soon as pierre gringoire had seen how this whole affair was
turning, and that there would decidedly be the rope, hanging, and other
disagreeable things for the principal personages in this comedy, he had
not cared to identify himself with the matter further. the outcasts

“madness! infamy! hold your tongue!”

“you do wrong to get angry,” muttered gringoire. “one obtains a respite;
that does no harm to any one, and allows the midwives, who are poor
women, to earn forty deniers parisis.”

the priest was not listening to him!

“but she must leave that place, nevertheless!” he murmured, “the decree
is to be executed within three days. moreover, there will be no decree;
that quasimodo! women have very depraved tastes!” he raised his voice:
“master pierre, i have reflected well; there is but one means of safety
for her.”

“what? i see none myself.”

“listen, master pierre, remember that you owe your life to her. i will
tell you my idea frankly. the church is watched night and day; only
those are allowed to come out, who have been seen to enter. hence
you can enter. you will come. i will lead you to her. you will change

“now, silence to march through paris! the password is, ‘little sword

ten minutes later, the cavaliers of the watch fled in terror before a
long procession of black and silent men which was descending towards
the pont an change, through the tortuous streets which pierce the
close-built neighborhood of the markets in every direction.




chapter iv. an awkward friend.



that night, quasimodo did not sleep. he had just made his last round of
the church. he had not noticed, that at the moment when he was closing
the doors, the archdeacon had passed close to him and betrayed some
displeasure on seeing him bolting and barring with care the enormous
iron locks which gave to their large leaves the solidity of a wall. dom
claude’s air was even more preoccupied than usual. moreover, since the
nocturnal adventure in the cell, he had constantly abused quasimodo,
but in vain did he ill trea
 
 ___________________________
 
t, and even beat him occasionally, nothing
disturbed the submission, patience, the devoted resignation of
the faithful bellringer. he endured everything on the part of the
archdeacon, insults, threats, blows, without murmuring a complaint. at
the most, he gazed uneasily after dom claude when the latter ascended
the staircase of the tower; but the archdeacon had abstained from
presenting himself again before the gypsy’s eyes.

on that night, accordingly, quasimodo, after having cast a glance at his
poor bells which he so neglected now, jacqueline, marie, and thibauld,
mounted to the summit of the northern tower, and there setting his dark
lanturn, well closed, upon the leads, he began to gaze at paris. the
night, as we have already said, was very dark. paris which, so to
speak was not lighted at that epoch, presented to the eye a confused
collection of black masses, cut here and there by the whitish curve of
the seine. quasimodo no longer saw any light w

nst himself, and that it was very
possible that something might happen soon. hence he remained upon his
tower on the watch, “dreaming in his dream-place,” as rabelais says,
with his eye directed alternately on the cell and on paris, keeping
faithful guard, like a good dog, with a thousand suspicions in his mind.

all at once, while he was scrutinizing the great city with that eye
which nature, by a sort of compensation, had made so piercing that it
could almost supply the other organs which quasimodo lacked, it
seemed to him that there was something singular about the quay de la
vieille-pelleterie, that there was a movement at that point, that the
line of the parapet, standing out blackly against the whiteness of the
water was not straight and tranquil, like that of the other quays, but
that it undulated to the eye, like the waves of a river, or like the
heads of a crowd in motion.

this struck him as strange. he redoubled his attention. the movement
seemed to be advancing towards the city.
 
 ___________________________
 
 there was no light. it lasted
for some time on the quay; then it gradually ceased, as though that
which was passing were entering the interior of the island; then
it stopped altogether, and the line of the quay became straight and
motionless again.

at the moment when quasimodo was lost in conjectures, it seemed to
him that the movement had re-appeared in the rue du parvis, which is
prolonged into the city perpendicularly to the façade of notre-dame.
at length, dense as was the darkness, he beheld the head of a column
debouch from that street, and in an instant a crowd--of which nothing
could be distinguished in the gloom except that it was a crowd--spread
over the place.

this spectacle had a terror of its own. it is probable that this
singular procession, which see

ccor arrived, if it should
arrive, and not to trouble la esmeralda’s sleep. this resolution once
taken, he set to examining the enemy with more tranquillity.

the throng seemed to increase every moment in the church square. only,
he presumed that it must be making very little noise, since the windows
on the place remained closed. all at once, a flame flashed up, and in
an instant seven or eight lighted torches passed over the heads of the
crowd, shaking their tufts of flame in the deep shade. quasimodo then
beheld distinctly surging in the parvis a frightful herd of men and
women in rags, armed with scythes, pikes, billhooks and partisans, whose
thousand points glittered. here and there black pitchforks formed horns
to the hideous faces. he vaguely recalled this populace, and thought
that he recognized all the heads who had saluted him as pope of the
fools some months previously. one man who held a torch in one hand and
a club in the other, mounted a stone post and seemed to be haranguing
the

m. at the same time the strange army executed several evolutions, as
though it were taking up its post around the church. quasimodo picked up
his lantern and descended to the platform between the towers, in order
to get a nearer view, and to spy out a means of defence.

clopin trouillefou, on arriving in front of the lofty portal of
notre-dame had, in fact, ranged his troops in order of battle. although
he expected no resistance, he wished, like a prudent general, to
preserve an order which would permit him to face, at need, a sudden
attack of the watch or the police. he had accordingly stationed his
brigade in such a manne

consent to it; so that she would be hanged to-morrow in the grève, if
god and the outcasts were not here. if your church is sacred, so is our
sister; if our sister is not sacred, neither is your church. that is why
we call upon you to return the girl if you wish to save your church, or
we will take possession of the girl again and pillage the church, which
will be a good thing. in token of which i here plant my banner, and may
god preserve you, bishop of paris.”

quasimodo could not, unfortunately, hear these words uttered with a sort
of sombre and savage majesty. a vagabond presented his banner to clopin,
who planted it solemnly between two paving-stones. it was a pitchfork
from whose points hung a bleeding quarter of carrion meat.

that done, the king of thunes turned round and cast his eyes over his
army, a fierce multitude whose glances flashed almost equally with their
pikes. after a momentary pause,--“forward, my sons!” he cried; “to work,
locksmiths!

on their legs and one on their heads. there were few which did not
deal their blow, and a large layer of dead and wounded lay bleeding
and panting beneath the feet of the assailants who, now grown furious,
replaced each other without intermission. the long beam continued to
belabor the door, at regular intervals, like the clapper of a bell, the
stones to rain down, the door to groan.

the reader has no doubt divined that this unexpected resistance which
had exasperated the outcasts came from quasimodo.

chance had, unfortunately, favored the brave deaf man.

when he had descended to the platform between the towers, his ideas were
all in confusion. he had run up and down along the gallery for several
minutes like a madman, surveying from above, the compact mass of
vagabonds ready to hurl itself on the church, demanding the safety of
the gypsy from the devil or from god. the thought had occurred to him of
ascending to the southern belfry and sounding the alarm, but before
he could have set the
 
 ___________________________
 
 clamor, was there not time to burst in the door of the
church ten times over? it was precisely the moment when the locksmiths
were advancing upon it with their tools. what was to be done?

all at once, he remembered that some masons had been at work all day
repairing the wall, the timber-work, and the roof of the south tower.
this was a flash of light. the wall was of stone, the roof of lead, the
timber-work of wood. (that prodigious timber-work, so dense that it was
called “the forest.”)

quasimodo hastened to that tower. the lower chambers were, in fact, full
of materials. there were piles of rough blocks of stone, sheets of lead
in rolls, bundles of laths, heavy beams already notched with the saw,
heaps of plaster.

time was pressing, the pikes and hammers were at work below. with a
strength which the sense of danger increased tenfold, he seized one
of the beams--the longest and heaviest; he pushed it out through a
loophole, then, grasping it again outside of the tower, he made it slide
 
 ___________________________
 

along the angle of the balustrade which surrounds the platform, and
let it fly into the abyss. the enormous timber, during that fall of a
hundred and sixty feet, scraping the wall, breaking the carvings, turned
many times on its centre, like the arm of a windmill flying off alone
through space. at last it reached the ground, the horrible cry arose,
and the black beam, as it rebounded from the pavement, resembled a
serpent leaping.

quasimodo beheld the outcasts scatter at the fall of the beam, like
ashes at the breath of a child. he took advantage of their fright, and
while they were fixing a superstitious glance on the club which had
fallen from heaven, and while they were putting out the eyes of the
stone saints on the front with a discharge of arrows and buckshot,
quasimodo was silently piling up plaster, stones, and rough blocks of
stone, even the sacks of tools belonging to the masons, on the edge of
the balustrade from which 
 
 ___________________________
 
the beam had already been hurled.

thus, as soon as they began to batter the grand door, the shower of
rough blocks of stone began to fall, and it seemed to them that the
church itself was being demolished over their heads.

any one who could have beheld quasimodo at that moment would have been
frightened. independently of the projectiles which he had piled upon the
balustrade, he had collected a heap of stones on the platform itself. as
fast as the blocks on the exterior edge were exhausted, he drew on the
heap. then he stooped and rose, stooped and rose again with incredible
activity. his huge gnome’s head bent over the balustrade, then an
enormous stone fell, then another, then another. from time to time, he
followed a fine stone with his eye, and w

said, “hum!”

meanwhile, the beggars did not grow discouraged. the thick door on which
they were venting their fury had already trembled more than twenty
times beneath the weight of their oaken battering-ram, multiplied by the
strength of a hundred men. the panels cracked, the carved work flew into
splinters, the hinges, at every blow, leaped from their pins, the planks
yawned, the wood crumbled to powder, ground between the iron sheathing.
fortunately for quasimodo, there was more iron than wood.

nevertheless, he felt that the great door was yielding. although he did
not hear it, every blow of the ram reverberated simultaneously in the
vaults of the church and within it. from above he beheld the vagabonds,
filled with triumph and rage, shaking their fists at the gloomy façade;
and both on the gypsy’s account and his own he envied the wings of the
owls which flitted away above his head in flocks.

his shower of stone blocks was not sufficient to repel

rage.

“impossible to get in!” he muttered between his teeth.

“an old, enchanted church!” grumbled the aged bohemian, mathias hungadi
spicali.

“by the pope’s whiskers!” went on a sham soldier, who had once been in
service, “here are church gutters spitting melted lead at you better
than the machicolations of lectoure.”

“do you see that demon passing and repassing in front of the fire?”
 exclaimed the duke of egypt.

“pardieu, ‘tis that damned bellringer, ‘tis quasimodo,” said clopin.

the bohemian tossed his head. “i tell you, that ‘tis the spirit sabnac,
the grand marquis, the demon of fortifications. he has the form of an
armed soldier, the head of a lion. sometimes he rides a hideous horse.
he changes men into stones, of which he builds towers. he commands
fifty legions ‘tis he indeed; i recognize him. sometimes he is clad in a
handsome golden robe, figured after the turkish fashion.”

“where is bellevigne de l’etoile?” demanded clopin.

line of cuirassed backs, undulating as they rose
through the gloom, one would have pronounced it a serpent with steel
scales, which was raising itself erect in front of the church. jehan who
formed the head, and who was whistling, completed the illusion.

the scholar finally reached the balcony of the gallery, and climbed over
it nimbly, to the applause of the whole vagabond tribe. thus master of
the citadel, he uttered a shout of joy, and suddenly halted, petrified.
he had just caught sight of quasimodo concealed in the dark, with
flashing eye, behind one of the statues of the kings.

before a second assailant could gain a foothold on the gallery, the
formidable hunchback leaped to the head of the ladder, without uttering
a word, seized the ends of the two uprights with his powerful hands,
raised them, pushed them out from the wall, balanced the long and pliant
ladder, loaded with vagabonds from top to bottom for a moment, in the
midst of shrieks of anguish, then suddenly, with superhuman forc

 launched backwards,
remained erect and standing for an instant, and seemed to hesitate, then
wavered, then suddenly, describing a frightful arc of a circle eighty
feet in radius, crashed upon the pavement with its load of ruffians,
more rapidly than a drawbridge when its chains break. there arose an
immense imprecation, then all was still, and a few mutilated wretches
were seen, crawling over the heap of dead.

a sound of wrath and grief followed the first cries of triumph among
the besiegers. quasimodo, impassive, with both elbows propped on the
balustrade, looked on. he had the air of an old, bushy-headed king at
his window.

as for jehan frollo, he was in a critical position. he found himself in
the gallery with the formidable bellringer, alone, separated from his
companions by a vertical wall eighty feet high. while quasimodo was
dealing with the ladder, the scholar had run to the postern which he
believed to be open. it was not. the deaf man had closed it behind him
when he entered the ga

 white bear.

for the first few moments, the deaf man paid no heed to him; but at last
he turned his head, and suddenly straightened up. he had just caught
sight of the scholar.

jehan prepared himself for a rough shock, but the deaf man remained
motionless; only he had turned towards the scholar and was looking at
him.

“ho ho!” said jehan, “what do you mean by staring at me with that
solitary and melancholy eye?”

as he spoke thus, the young scamp stealthily adjusted his crossbow.

“quasimodo!” he cried, “i am going to change your surname: you shall be
called the blind man.”

the shot sped. the feathered vireton* whizzed and entered the
hunchback’s left arm. quasimodo appeared no more moved by it than by a
scratch to king pharamond. he laid his hand on the arrow, tore it from
his arm, and tranquilly broke it across his big knee; then he let the
two pieces drop on the floor, rather than threw them down. but jehan
had no opportunity to fire a second time. the arrow broken, qua

breathing heavily, bounded like a grasshopper, and he fell upon the
scholar, whose armor was flattened against the wall by the blow.


     *  an arrow with a pyramidal head of iron and copper spiral wings by
which a rotatory motion was communicated.


then in that gloom, wherein wavered the light of the torches, a terrible
thing was seen.

quasimodo had grasped with his left hand the two arms of jehan, who did
not offer any resistance, so thoroughly did he feel that he was lost.
with his right hand, the deaf man detached one by one, in silence, with
sinister slowness, all the pieces of his armor, the sword, the daggers,
the helmet, the cuirass, the leg pieces. one would have said that it was
a monkey taking the shell from a nut. quasimodo flung the scholar’s
iron shell at his feet, piece by piece. when the scholar beheld himself
disarmed

, stripped, weak, and naked in those terrible hands, he made no
attempt to speak to the deaf man, but began to laugh audaciously in his
face, and to sing with his intrepid heedlessness of a child of sixteen,
the then popular ditty:--

         “_elle est bien habillée,
         la ville de cambrai;
         marafin l’a pillée_...” *


     * the city of cambrai is well dressed.  marafin plundered it.


he did not finish. quasimodo was seen on the parapet of the gallery,
holding the scholar by the feet with one hand and whirling him over
the abyss like a sling; then a sound like that of a bony structure in
contact with a wall was heard, and something was seen to fall which
halted a third of the way down in its fall, on a projection in the
architecture. it was a dead body which remained hanging there, bent
double, its loins broken, its skull empty.

a cry of horror rose among the vagabonds.

“vengeance!” shouted clopin

. “to the sack!” replied the multitude.
“assault! assault!”

there came a tremendous howl, in which were mingled all tongues, all
dialects, all accents. the death of the poor scholar imparted a furious
ardor to that crowd. it was seized with shame, and the wrath of having
been held so long in check before a church by a hunchback. rage found
ladders, multiplied the torches, and, at the expiration of a few
minutes, quasimodo, in despair, beheld that terrible ant heap mount on
all sides to the assault of notre-dame. those who had no ladders had
knotted ropes; those who had no ropes climbed by the projections of
the carvings. they hung from each other’s rags. there were no means of
resisting that rising tide of frightful faces; rage made these fierce
countenances ruddy; their clayey brows were dripping with sweat; their
eyes darted lightnings; all these grimaces, all these horrors laid siege
to quasimodo. one would

the parvis was resplendent, and cast a radiance on the sky; the bonfire
lighted on the lofty platform was still burning, and illuminated the
city far away. the enormous silhouette of the two towers, projected afar
on the roofs of paris, and formed a large notch of black in this light.
the city seemed to be aroused. alarm bells wailed in the distance.
the vagabonds howled, panted, swore, climbed; and quasimodo, powerless
against so many enemies, shuddering for the gypsy, beholding the furious
faces approaching ever nearer and nearer to his gallery, entreated
heaven for a miracle, and wrung his arms in despair.

“eh, quick! come!” said the other.

both descended towards the city with long strides.




chapter vii. chateaupers to the rescue.



the reader will, perhaps, recall the critical situation in which we left
quasimodo. the brave deaf man, assailed on all sides, had lost, if
not all courage, at least all hope of saving, not himself (he was not
thinking of himself), but the gypsy. he ran distractedly along the
gallery. notre-dame was on the point of being taken by storm by
the outcasts. all at once, a great galloping of horses filled the
neighboring streets, and, with a long file of torches and a thick column
of cavaliers, with free reins and lances in rest, these furious sounds
debouched on the place like a h

the frightened vagabonds wheeled round.

quasimodo who did not hear, saw the naked swords, the torches, the
irons of the pikes, all that cavalry, at the head of which he recognized
captain phoebus; he beheld the confusion of the outcasts, the terror
of some, the disturbance among the bravest of them, and from this
unexpected succor he recovered so much strength, that he hurled from the
church the first assailants who were already climbing into the gallery.

it was, in fact, the king’s troops who had arrived. the vagabonds

the flank, by the rue saint-pierre-aux-boeufs, and in the rear through
the rue du parvis, driven to bay against notre-dame, which they
still assailed and quasimodo defended, at the same time besiegers and
besieged, they were in the singular situation in which comte henri
harcourt, _taurinum obsessor idem et obsessus_, as his epitaph says,
found himself later on, at the famous siege of turin, in 1640, between
prince thomas of savoy, whom he was besieging, and the marquis de
leganez, who was blockading him.

it one could confusedly distinguish the front of notre-dame, and the
decrepit hôtel-dieu with some wan invalids gazing down from the heights
of its roof all checkered with dormer windows.

at length the vagabonds gave way. weariness, the lack of good weapons,
the fright of this surprise, the musketry from the windows, the valiant
attack of the king’s troops, all overwhelmed them. they forced the
line of assailants, and fled in every direction, leaving the parvis
encumbered with dead.

when quasimodo, who had not ceased to fight for a moment, beheld
this rout, he fell on his knees and raised his hands to heaven; then,
intoxicated with joy, he ran, he ascended with the swiftness of a bird
to that cell, the approaches to which he had so intrepidly defended.
he had but one thought now; it was to kneel before her whom he had just
saved for the second time.

when he entered the cell, he found it empty.

the executioner, who had not loosed his hold on the young girl, began to
ascend the ladder once more.




chapter ii. the beautiful creature clad in white. (dante.)



when quasimodo saw that the cell was empty, that the gypsy was no longer
there, that while he had been defending her she had been abducted, he
grasped his hair with both hands and stamped with surprise and pain;
then he set out to run through the entire church seeking his bohemian,
howling strange cries to all the corners of the walls, strewing his red
hair on the pavement. it was just at the moment when the king’s archers
were making their victorious entrance into notre-dame, also in search
of the gypsy. q

oor, deaf fellow, aided them in their fatal
intentions, without suspecting it; he thought that the outcasts were the
gypsy’s enemies. he himself conducted tristan l’hermite to all possible
hiding-places, opened to him the secret doors, the double bottoms of
the altars, the rear sacristries. if the unfortunate girl had still been
there, it would have been he himself who would have delivered her up.

when the fatigue of finding nothing had disheartened tristan, who was
not easily discouraged, quasimodo continued the search alone. he made
the tour of the church twenty times, length and breadth, up and
down, ascending and descending, running, calling, shouting, peeping,
rummaging, ransacking, thrusting his head into every hole, pushing a
torch under every vault, despairing, mad. a male who has lost his female
is no more roaring nor more haggard.

at last when he was sure, perfectly sure that she was no longer there,
that all was at an end, that she had been snatched from him, he slowly
mounted

the staircase to the towers, that staircase which he had
ascended with so much eagerness and triumph on the day when he had
saved her. he passed those same places once more with drooping head,
voiceless, tearless, almost breathless. the church was again deserted,
and had fallen back into its silence. the archers had quitted it to
track the sorceress in the city. quasimodo, left alone in that vast
notre-dame, so besieged and tumultuous but a short time before, once
more betook himself to the cell where the gypsy had slept for so many
weeks under his guardianship.

as he approached it, he fancied that he might, perhaps, find her there.
when, at the turn of the gallery which opens on the roof of the side
aisles, he perceived the tiny cell with its little window and its little
door crouching beneath a great flying buttress like a bird’s nest under
a branch, the po

radle and a full coffin. he uttered not
a word; only at long intervals, a sob heaved his body violently, but it
was a tearless sob, like summer lightning which makes no noise.

it appears to have been then, that, seeking at the bottom of his lonely
thoughts for the unexpected abductor of the gypsy, he thought of the
archdeacon. he remembered that dom claude alone possessed a key to the
staircase leading to the cell; he recalled his nocturnal attempts on
the young girl, in the first of which he, quasimodo, had assisted, the
second of which he had prevented. he recalled a thousand details, and
soon he no longer doubted that the archdeacon had taken the gypsy.
nevertheless, such was his respect for the priest, such his gratitude,
his devotion, his love for this man had taken such deep root in his
heart, that they resisted, even at this moment, the talons of jealousy
and despair.

he reflected that the archdeacon had done this thing, and the wrath
of blood and death which it would have evoked in hi

figure was coming towards him. he recognized it. it was the archdeacon.

claude was walking with a slow, grave step. he did not look before him
as he walked, he was directing his course towards the northern tower,
but his face was turned aside towards the right bank of the seine, and
he held his head high, as though trying to see something over the roofs.
the owl often assumes this oblique attitude. it flies towards one
point and looks towards another. in this manner the priest passed above
quasimodo without seeing him.

the deaf man, who had been petrified by this sudden apparition, beheld
him disappear through the door of the staircase to the north tower. the
reader is aware that this is the tower from which the hôtel-de-ville is
visible. quasimodo rose and followed the archdeacon.

quasimodo ascended the tower staircase for the sake of ascending it, for
the sake of seeing why the priest was ascending it. moreover, the poor
bellringer did not know what he (quasimodo) should do, what he

he gypsy had come into conflict in his heart.

when he reached the summit of the tower, before emerging from the shadow
of the staircase and stepping upon the platform, he cautiously examined
the position of the priest. the priest’s back was turned to him. there
is an openwork balustrade which surrounds the platform of the bell
tower. the priest, whose eyes looked down upon the town, was resting his
breast on that one of the four sides of the balustrades which looks upon
the pont notre-dame.

quasimodo, advancing with the tread of a wolf behind him, went to see
what he was gazing at thus.

the priest’s attention was so absorbed elsewhere that he did not hear
the deaf man walking behind him.

paris is a magnificent and charming spectacle, and especially at that
day, viewed from the top of the towers of notre-dame, in the fresh light
of a summer dawn. the day might have been in july. the sky was perfectly
serene. some tardy stars were fading away at various points, and there
was a very brilli

sed over this half-awakened city. towards the east, the morning
breeze chased a few soft white bits of wool torn from the misty fleece
of the hills.

in the parvis, some good women, who had their milk jugs in their
hands, were pointing out to each other, with astonishment, the singular
dilapidation of the great door of notre-dame, and the two solidified
streams of lead in the crevices of the stone. this was all that remained
of the tempest of the night. the bonfire lighted between the towers by
quasimodo had died out. tristan had already cleared up the place, and
had the dead thrown into the seine. kings like louis xi. are careful to
clean the pavement quickly after a massacre.

outside the balustrade of the tower, directly under the point where the
priest had paused, there was one of those fantastically carved stone
gutters with which gothic edifices bristle, and, in a crevice of that
gutter, two pretty wallflowers in blossom, shaken out and vivified,
as it were, by the breath of air, made fro

but the priest was not listening to, was not looking at, anything of all
this. he was one of the men for whom there are no mornings, no birds,
no flowers. in that immense horizon, which assumed so many aspects about
him, his contemplation was concentrated on a single point.

quasimodo was burning to ask him what he had done with the gypsy; but
the archdeacon seemed to be out of the world at that moment. he was
evidently in one of those violent moments of life when one would not
feel the earth crumble. he remained motionless and silent, with his eyes
steadily fixed on a certain point; and there was something so terrible
about this silence and immobility that the savage bellringer shuddered
before it and dared not come in contact with it. only, and this was also
one way of int

errogating the archdeacon, he followed the direction of
his vision, and in this way the glance of the unhappy deaf man fell upon
the place de grève.

thus he saw what the priest was looking at. the ladder was erected near
the permanent gallows. there were some people and many soldiers in
the place. a man was dragging a white thing, from which hung something
black, along the pavement. this man halted at the foot of the gallows.

here something took place which quasimodo could not see very clearly. it
was not because his only eye had not preserved its long range, but there
was a group of soldiers which prevented his seeing everything. moreover,
at that moment the sun appeared, and such a flood of light overflowed
the horizon that one would have said that all the points in paris,
spires, chimneys, gables, had simultaneously taken fire.

meanwhile, the man began to mount the ladder. then quasimodo saw him
again distinctly. he was carrying a woman on his shoulder,

 a young girl
dressed in white; that young girl had a noose about her neck. quasimodo
recognized her.

it was she.

the man reached the top of the ladder. there he arranged the noose. here
the priest, in order to see the better, knelt upon the balustrade.

all at once the man kicked away the ladder abruptly, and quasimodo, who
had not breathed for several moments, beheld the unhappy child dangling
at the end of the rope two fathoms above the pavement, with the man
squatting on her shoulders. the rope made several gyrations on itself,
and quasimodo beheld horrible convulsions run along the gypsy’s body.
the priest, on his side, with outstretched neck and eyes starting from
his head, contemplated this horrible group of the man and the young
girl,--the spider and the fly.

at the moment when it was most horrible,

 the laugh of a demon, a laugh
which one can only give vent to when one is no longer human, burst forth
on the priest’s livid face.

quasimodo did not hear that laugh, but he saw it.

the bellringer retreated several paces behind the archdeacon, and
suddenly hurling himself upon him with fury, with his huge hands he
pushed him by the back over into the abyss over which dom claude was
leaning.

the priest shrieked: “damnation!” and fell.

the spout, above which he had stood, arrested him in his fall. he clung
to it with desperate hands, and, at the moment when he opened his mouth
to utter a second cry, he beheld the formidable and

then he was silent.

the abyss was there below him. a fall of more than two hundred feet and
the pavement.

in this terrible situation, the archdeacon said not a word, uttered not
a groan. he merely writhed upon the spout, with incredible efforts to
climb up again; but his hands had no hold on the granite, his feet slid
along the blackened wall without catching fast. people who have ascended
the towers of notre-dame know that there is a sw

immediately beneath the balustrade. it was on this retreating angle
that miserable archdeacon exhausted himself. he had not to deal with a
perpendicular wall, but with one which sloped away beneath him.

quasimodo had but to stretch out his hand in order to draw him from the
gulf; but he did not even look at him. he was looking at the grève. he
was looking at the gallows. he was looking at the gypsy.

the deaf man was leaning, with his elbows on the balustrade, at the
spot where the archdeacon had been a moment before, and there, never
detaching his gaze from the only object which existed for him in the
world at that moment, he remained motionless and mute, like a man struck
by lightning, and a long str

 feet lower down, by
projections of the sculpture, and he prayed heaven, from the depths of
his distressed soul, that he might be allowed to finish his life, were
it to last two centuries, on that space two feet square. once, he
glanced below him into the place, into the abyss; the head which he
raised again had its eyes closed and its hair standing erect.

there was something frightful in the silence of these two men. while
the archdeacon agonized in this terrible fashion a few feet below him,
quasimodo wept and gazed at the grève.

the archdeacon, seeing that all his exertions served only to weaken the
fragile support which remained to him, decided to remain quiet. there he
hung, embracing the gutter, hardly breathing, no longer stirring, making
no longer any other movements than that mechanical convulsion of the
stomach, which one experiences in dreams when one fancies himself
falling. his fixed eyes were wide open with a stare. he lost ground
little by little, nevertheless, his fingers sli

 body. the curve of the lead which sustained him inclined
more and more each instant towards the abyss.

he beheld below him, a frightful thing, the roof of saint-jean le rond,
as small as a card folded in two. he gazed at the impressive carvings,
one by one, of the tower, suspended like himself over the precipice, but
without terror for themselves or pity for him. all was stone around him;
before his eyes, gaping monsters; below, quite at the bottom, in the
place, the pavement; above his head, quasimodo weeping.

in the parvis there were several groups of curious good people, who were
tranquilly seeking to divine who the madman could be who was amusing
himself in so strange a manner. the priest heard them saying, for their
voices reached him, clear and shrill: “why, he will break his neck!”

quasimodo wept.

at last the archdeacon, foaming with rage and despair, understood that
all was in vain. nevertheless, he collected all the strength which
remained to him for a final effort. he stiffen

ed himself upon the spout,
pushed against the wall with both his knees, clung to a crevice in the
stones with his hands, and succeeded in climbing back with one foot,
perhaps; but this effort made the leaden beak on which he rested
bend abruptly. his cassock burst open at the same time. then, feeling
everything give way beneath him, with nothing but his stiffened and
failing hands to support him, the unfortunate man closed his eyes and
let go of the spout. he fell.

quasimodo watched him fall.

a fall from such a height is seldom perpendicular. the archdeacon,
launched into space, fell at first head foremost, with outspread hands;
then he whirled over and over many times; the wind blew him upon
the roof of a house, where the unfortunate man began to break up.
nevertheless, he was not dead when he reached there. the bellringer saw
him still endeavor to cling to a gable with his nails; but the surface
sloped too much, and he had no more strength. he slid rapidly along

 the
roof like a loosened tile, and dashed upon the pavement. there he no
longer moved.

then quasimodo raised his eyes to the gypsy, whose body he beheld
hanging from the gibbet, quivering far away beneath her white robe with
the last shudderings of anguish, then he dropped them on the archdeacon,
stretched out at the base of the tower, and no longer retaining the
human form, and he said, with a sob which heaved his deep chest,--“oh!
all that i have ever loved!”

came to pick up

 from the pavement of the parvis the dislocated corpse of
the archdeacon, quasimodo had disappeared.

a great many rumors were in circulation with regard to this adventure.
no one doubted but that the day had come when, in accordance with their
compact, quasimodo, that is to say, the devil, was to carry off claude
frollo, that is to say, the sorcerer. it was presumed that he had broken
the body when taking the soul, like monkeys who break the shell to get
at the nut.

this is why the archdeacon was not interred in consecrated earth.

louis xi. died a year later, in the month of august, 1483.

success in tragedy. it appears that, after having tasted astrology,

phoebus de châteaupers also came to a tragic end. he married.




chapter iv. the marriage of quasimodo.



we have just said that quasimodo disappeared from notre-dame on the day
of the gypsy’s and of the archdeacon’s death. he was not seen again, in
fact; no one knew what had become of him.

during the night which followed the execution of la esmeralda, the night
men had detached her body from the gibbet, and had carried it, according
to custom, to the cellar of montfauçon.

montfauçon was, as sauval says, “the most ancient and the most superb
gibbet in the kingdom.” between the faubo

s, which were taken from the chains of montfauçon, but also the
bodies of all the unfortunates executed on the other permanent gibbets
of paris. to that deep charnel-house, where so many human remains and so
many crimes have rotted in company, many great ones of this world,
many innocent people, have contributed their bones, from enguerrand de
marigni, the first victim, and a just man, to admiral de coligni, who
was its last, and who was also a just man.

as for the mysterious disappearance of quasimodo, this is all that we
have been able to discover.

about eighteen months or two years after the events which terminate this
story, when search was made in that cavern for the body of olivier le
daim, who had been hanged two days previously, and to whom charles
viii. had granted the favor of being buried in saint laurent, in better
company, they found among all those hideous carcasses two skeletons, one
of which held the other in its embrace. one of these skeletons, which
was that of a woman, sti
