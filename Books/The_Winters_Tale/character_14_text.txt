here's ado, to lock up honesty and honour from
the access of gentle visitors!--is't lawful,
pray you, to see her women? any of them?
emilia?

        so please you, madam, to put
apart these your attendants, i

which never tender lady hath borne greater,--

       a daughter; and a goodly babe,
lusty, and like to live: the queen receives

d my best obedience to the queen;
if she dares trust me with her little babe,
i'll show't the king, and undertake to be
her advocate to th' loud'st. we do not know
how he may soften at the sight o' the child:
the silence often of pure innocence
persuades, when speaking fails.

emilia.
                                most worthy madam,
your honour and your goodness is so evident,
that your free undertaking cannot miss
a thriving issue: there is no lady living
so meet for this great errand. please your ladyship
to visit the next room, i'll presently
acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;
who but to-day hammer'd of this design,
but durst not tempt a minister of honour,
lest she should be denied.

madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,
i know not what i shall incur to pass it,
having no warrant.

paulina.
                   you need not fear it, sir:
this child was prisoner to the womb, and is,
by law and process of great nature thence
freed and enfranchis'd: not a party to
the anger of the king, nor guilty of,
if any be, the trespass of the queen.
