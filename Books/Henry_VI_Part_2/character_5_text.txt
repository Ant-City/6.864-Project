to you duke humfrey must vnload his greefe:
your greefe, the common greefe of all the land.
what? did my brother henry spend his youth,
his valour, coine, and people in the warres?
did he so often lodge in open field:
in winters cold, and summers parching heate,
to conquer france, his true inheritance?
and did my brother bedford toyle his wits,
to keepe by policy what henrie got:
haue you your selues, somerset, buckingham,
braue yorke, salisbury, and victorious warwicke,
receiud deepe scarres in france and normandie:
or hath mine vnckle beauford, and my selfe,
with all the learned counsell of the realme,
studied so long, sat in the councell house,
early and late, debating too and fro
how france and frenchmen might be kept in awe,
and hath his highnesse in his infancie,

my sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no teares.

i neuer saw but humfrey duke of gloster,

more like a souldier then a man o'th' church,
as stout and proud as he were lord of all,
sweare like a ruffian, and demeane himselfe
vnlike the ruler of a common-weale.
warwicke my sonne, the comfort of my age,
thy deeds, thy plainnesse, and thy house-keeping,
hath wonne the greatest fauour of the commons,
excepting none but good duke humfrey.

in bringing them to ciuill discipline:
thy late exploits done in the heart of france,
when thou wert regent for our soueraigne,
haue made thee fear'd and honor'd of the people,
ioyne we together for the publike good,
in what we can, to bridle and suppresse
the pride of suffolke, and the cardinall,

i cannot blame them all, what is't to them?
