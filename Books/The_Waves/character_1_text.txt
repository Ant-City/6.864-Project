hant with a passion that is never obscure or formless the loves of catullus, reading from a big book, a quarto with margins. i shall lie, too, in the fields among the tickling grasses. i shall lie with my friends under the towering elm trees.

'behold, the headmaster. alas, that he should excite my ridicule. he is too sleek, he is altogether too shiny and black, like some statue in a public garden. and on the left side of his waistcoat, his taut, his drum-like waistcoat, hangs a crucifix.'

'old crane,' said bernard, 'now rises to address us. old crane, the headmaster, has a nose like a mountain at sunset, and a blue cleft in his chin, like a wooded ravine, which some tripper has fired; like a wooded ravine seen from the train window. he sways slightly, mouthing out his tremendous and sonorous words. i love tremendous and sonorous words. but his words are too hearty to be true. yet he is by this time convinced of their truth. and when he leaves the room, lurching rather heavily from side to

'now we march, two by two,' said louis, 'orderly, processional, into chapel. i like the dimness that falls as we enter the sacred building. i like the orderly progress. we file in; we seat ourselves. we put off our distinctions as we enter. i like it now, when, lurching slightly, but only from his momentum, dr crane mounts the pulpit and reads the lesson from a bible spread on the back of the brass eagle. i rejoice; my heart expands in his bulk, in his authority. he lays the whirling dust clouds in my tremulous, my ignominiously agitated mind--how we danced round the christmas tree and handing parcels they forgot me, and the fat woman said, "this little boy has no present," and gave me a shiny union jack from the top of the tree, and i cried with fury--to be remembered with pity. now all is laid by his aut

t is the difference between us? wait though, neville; let me talk. the bubbles are rising like the silver bubbles from the floor of a saucepan; image on top of image. i cannot sit down to my book, like louis, with ferocious tenacity. i must open the little trap-door and let out these linked phrases in which i run together whatever happens, so that instead of incoherence there is perceived a wandering thread, lightly joining one thing to another. i will tell you the story of the doctor.

'when dr crane lurches through the swing-doors after prayers he is convinced, it seems, of his immense superiority; and indeed neville, we cannot deny that his departure leaves us not only with a sense of relief, but also with a sense of something removed, like a tooth. now let us follow him as he heaves through the swing-door to his own apartments. let us imagine him in his private room over the stables undressing. he unfastens his sock suspenders (let us be trivial, let us be intimate). then with a characte

 to avoid these ready-made phrases, and they are, in his case, somehow appropriate) he takes the silver, he takes the coppers from his trouser pockets and places them there, and there, on his dressing-table. with both arms stretched on the arms of his chair he reflects (this is his private moment; it is here we must try to catch him): shall he cross the pink bridge into his bedroom or shall he not cross it? the two rooms are united by a bridge of rosy light from the lamp at the bedside where mrs crane lies with her hair on the pillow reading a french memoir. as she reads, she sweeps her hand with an abandoned and despairing gesture over her forehead, and sighs, "is this all?" comparing herself with some french duchess. now, says the doctor, in two years i shall retire. i shall clip yew hedges in a west country garden. an admiral i might have been; or a judge; not a schoolmaster. what forces, he asks, staring at the gas-fire with his shoulders hunched up more hugely than we know them (he is i

eflection. i require the concrete in everything. it is so only that i lay hands upon the world. a good phrase, however, seems to me to have an independent existence. yet i think it is likely that the best are made in solitude. they require some final refrigeration which i cannot give them, dabbling always in warm soluble words. my method, nevertheless, has certain advantages over theirs. neville is repelled by the grossness of trumble. louis, glancing, tripping with the high step of a disdainful crane, picks up words as if in sugar-tongs. it is true that his eyes--wild, laughing, yet desperate--express something that we have not gauged. there is about both neville and louis a precision, an exactitude, that i admire and shall never possess. now i begin to be aware that action is demanded. we approach a junction; at a junction i have to change. i have to board a train for edinburgh. i cannot precisely lay fingers on this fact--it lodges loosely among my thoughts like a button, like a small coi

'yet behold, it returns. one cannot extinguish that persistent smell. it steals in through some crack in the structure--one's identity. i am not part of the street--no, i observe the street. one splits off, therefore. for instance, up that back street a girl stands waiting; for whom? a romantic story. on the wall of that shop is fixed a small crane, and for what reason, i ask, was that crane fixed there? and invent a purple lady swelling, circumambient, hauled from a barouche landau by a perspiring husband sometime in the sixties. a grotesque story. that is, i am a natural coiner of words, a blower of bubbles through one thing and another. and, striking off these observations spontaneously, i elaborate myself; differentiate myself and, listening to the voice that says as i stroll past, "look! take note of that!" i conceive myself called u

ets and bind them together and offer them to percival, something given him by me. look now at what percival has given me. look at the street now that percival is dead. the houses are lightly founded to be puffed over by a breath of air. reckless and random the cars race and roar and hunt us to death like bloodhounds. i am alone in a hostile world. the human face is hideous. this is to my liking. i want publicity and violence and to be dashed like a stone on the rocks. i like factory chimneys and cranes and lorries. i like the passing of face and face and face, deformed, indifferent. i am sick of prettiness; i am sick of privacy. i ride rough waters and shall sink with no one to save me.

lation. unhappy, unfriended, in exile he would sometimes, in moments of confidence, describe how the surf swept over the beaches of his home. the remorseless eye of youth fixed itself upon his swollen joints. yes, but we were also quick to perceive how cutting, how apt, how severe he was, how naturally, when we lay under the elm trees pretending to watch cricket, we waited his approval, seldom given. his ascendancy was resented, as percival's was adored. prim, suspicious, lifting his feet like a crane, there was yet a legend that he had smashed a door with his naked fist. but his peak was too bare, too stony for that kind of mist to cling to it. he was without those simple attachments by which one is connected with another. he remained aloof; enigmatic; a scholar capable of that inspired accuracy which has something formidable about it. my phrases (how to describe the moon) did not meet with his approval. on the other hand, he envied me to the point of desperation for being at my ease with s
