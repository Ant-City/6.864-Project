[CHARACTER] - 
                two
races of miniature people whom gulliver meets
on his first voyage. [CHARACTER] are prone to
conspiracies and jealousies, and while they treat gulliver well
enough materially, they are quick to take advantage of him in political
intrigues of various sorts. the two races have been in a longstanding
war with each over the interpretation of a reference in their common
holy scripture to the proper way to eat eggs. gulliver helps the
lilliputians defeat the blefuscudian navy, but he eventually leaves
lilliput and receives a warm welcome in the court of blefuscu, by
which swift satirizes the arbitrariness of international relations.
