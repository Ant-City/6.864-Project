    without a tongue, using conceit alone,
    without eyes, ears, and harmful sound of words-

  arthur. as little prince, having so great a title
    to be more prince, as may be. you are sad.
  hubert. indeed i have been merrier.
  arthur. mercy on me!
    methinks no body should be sad but i;
    yet, i remember, when i was in france,
    young gentlemen would be as sad as night,
    only for wantonness. by my christendom,
    so i were out of prison and kept sheep,
    i should be as merry as the day is long;
    and so i would be here but that i doubt
    my uncle practises more harm to me;
    he is afraid of me, and i of him.
    is it my fault that i was geffrey's son?

no, indeed, is't not; and i would to heaven
    i were your son, so you would love me, hubert.
  hubert.  [aside]  if i talk to him, with his innocent prate
    he will awake my mercy, which lies dead;
    therefore i will be sudden and dispatch.
  arthur. are you sick, hubert? you look pale to-day;
    in sooth, i would you were a little sick,
    that i might sit all night and watch with you.
    i warrant i love you more than you do me.

    and i did never ask it you again;
    and with my hand at midnight held your head;
    and, like the watchful minutes to the hour,
    still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time,
    saying 'what lack you?' and 'where lies your grief?'

    if heaven be pleas'd that you must use me ill,
    why, then you must. will you put out mine eyes,
    these eyes that never did nor never shall
    so much as frown on you?
  hubert. i have sworn to do it;
    and with hot irons must i burn them out.
  arthur. ah, none but in this iron age would do it!
    the iron of itself, though heat red-hot,
    approaching near these eyes would drink my tears,
    and quench his fiery indignation
    even in the matter of mine innocence;
    nay, after that, consume away in rust
    but for containing fire to harm mine eye.

  hubert. give me the iron, i say, and bind him here.
  arthur. alas, what need you be so boist'rous rough?
    i will not struggle, i will stand stone-still.
    for heaven sake, hubert, let me not be bound!
    nay, hear me, hubert! drive these men away,
    and i will sit as quiet as a lamb;
    i will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,
    nor look upon the iron angrily;

  arthur. is there no remedy?
  hubert. none, but to lose your eyes.
  arthur. o heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,
    a grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
    any annoyance in that precious sense!
    then, feeling what small things are boisterous there,
    your vile intent must needs seem horrible.
  hubert. is this your promise? go to, hold your tongue.

thee; a rush will be a beam
    to hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,
    put but a little water in a spoon
    and it shall be as all the ocean,
    enough to stifle such a villain up
    i do suspect thee very grievously.
  hubert. if i in act, consent, or sin of thought,
    be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
    which was embounded in this beauteous clay,
    let hell want pains enough to torture me!
    i left him well.
  bastard. go, bear him in thine arms.
    i am amaz'd, methinks, and lose my way
    among the thorns and dangers of this world.
    how easy dost thou take all england up!
    from forth this morsel of dead royalty
    the life, the right, and truth of all this realm

d host, the dauphin and his powers.
    your nobles will not hear you, but are gone
    to offer service to your enemy;
    and wild amazement hurries up and down
    the little number of your doubtful friends.
  king john. would not my lords return to me again
    after they heard young arthur was alive?
    bastard. they found him dead, and cast into the streets,
    an empty casket, where the jewel of life
    by some damn'd hand was robbed and ta'en away.
  king john. that villain hubert told me he did live.
  bastard. so, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.
    but wherefore do you droop? why look you sad?
    be great in act, as you have been in thought;
    let not the world see fear and sad distrust
    govern the motion of a kingly eye.
    be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;
    threaten the threat'ner, and outface the brow
    of bragging horror; so shall inferior eyes,
    that borrow their behaviours from the great,
    grow great by your example a

  king john. how goes the day with us? o, tell me, hubert.
  hubert. badly, i fear. how fares your majesty?

    i say again, if lewis do will the day,
    he is forsworn if e'er those eyes of yours
    behold another day break in the east;
    but even this night, whose black contagious breath
    already smokes about the burning crest
    of the old, feeble, and day-wearied sun,
    even this ill night, your breathing shall expire,
    paying the fine of rated treachery
    even with a treacherous fine of all your lives.
    if lewis by your assistance win the day.
    commend me to one hubert, with your king;
    the love of him-and this respect besides,
    for that my grandsire was an englishman-
    awakes my conscience to confess all this.
    in lieu whereof, i pray you, bear me hence
    from forth the noise and rumour of the field,
    where i may think the remnant of my thoughts
    in peace, and part this body and my soul
    with contemplation and devout desires.
  salisbury. we do believe thee; and beshrew my soul
    but i do love the favour and the form

 news! beshrew thy very heart!
    i did not think to be so sad to-night
    as this hath made me. who was he that said
    king john did fly an hour or two before
    the stumbling night did part our weary pow'rs?
  messenger. whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.
  lewis. keep good quarter and good care to-night;
    the day shall not be up so soon as i
    to try the fair adventure of to-morrow.

enter the bastard and hubert, severally

  hubert. who's there? speak, ho! speak quickly, or i shoot.
  bastard. a friend. what art thou?
  hubert. of the part of england.
  bastard. whither dost thou go?
  hubert. what's that to thee? why may i not demand
    of thine affairs as well as thou of mine?
  bastard. hubert, i think.
  hubert. thou hast a perfect thought.
    i will upon all hazards well believe
    thou art my friend that know'st my tongue so well.
    who art thou?
  bastard. who thou wilt. and i

    i come one way of the plantagenets.
  hubert. unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night
    have done me shame. brave soldier, pardon me
    that any accent breaking from thy tongue
    should scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.
  bastard. come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?
  hubert. why, here walk i in the black brow of night
    to find you out.
  bastard. brief, then; and what's the news?
  hubert. o, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,
    black, fearful, comfortless, and horrible.
  bastard. show me the very wound of this ill news;
    i am no woman, i'll not swoon at it.
  hubert. the king, i fear, is poison'd by a monk;
    i left him almost speechless and broke out
    to acquaint you with this evil, that you might
    the better arm you to the sudden time
    than if you had at leisure known of this.

nk, i tell you; a resolved villain,
    whose bowels suddenly burst out. the king
    yet speaks, and peradventure may recover.
  bastard. who didst thou leave to tend his majesty?
  hubert. why, know you not? the lords are all come back,
    and brought prince henry in their company;
    at whose request the king hath pardon'd them,
    and they are all about his majesty.
  bastard. withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,
    and tempt us not to bear above our power!
    i'll tell thee, hubert, half my power this night,
    passing these flats, are taken by the tide-
    these lincoln washes have devoured them;
    myself, well-mounted, hardly have escap'd.
