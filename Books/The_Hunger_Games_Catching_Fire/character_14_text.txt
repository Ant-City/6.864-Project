chaff never could stay out of a fight,” and sighs frequently. 

for my part, i try to make some mental record of the other tributes, but like last year, only 
a few really stick in my head. there's the classically beautiful brother and sister from district 
1 who were victors in consecutive years when i was little. brutus, a volunteer from district 2, 
who  must  be  at  least  forty  and  apparently  can't  wait  to  get  back  in  the  arena.  finnick,  the 
handsome  bronze-haired  guy  from  district  4  who  was  crowned  ten  years  ago  at the  age  of 
fourteen. a hysterical young woman with flowing brown hair is also called from 4, but she's 
quickly replaced by a volunteer, an eighty-year-old woman who needs a cane to walk to the 
stage.  then  there's  johanna  mason,  the  only  living  female  victo

impossible,  so  i  decide  to  go  find  someone  to  make  me  tea  or  hot  chocolate  or  anything. 
maybe haymitch is still up. surely he isn't asleep. 

i  order  warm  milk,  the  most  calming  thing  i  can  think  of,  from  an  attendant.  hearing 
voices from the television room, i go in and find peeta. beside him on the couch is the box 
effie sent of tapes of the old hunger games. i recognize the episode in which brutus became 
victor. 

peeta rises and flips off the tape when he sees me. “couldn't sleep?” 

“not  for  long,”  i  say.  i  pull  the  robe  more  securely  around  me  as  i  remember  the  old 

woman transforming into the rodent. 

“want  to  talk  about  it?”  he  asks.  sometimes  that  can  help,  but  i  just  shake  my  head, 

feeling weak that people i haven't even fought yet already haunt me.

don't owe him more than that. 

as i watch the procession to the city circle, i think how it's bad enough that they dress us 
all  up  in  costumes  and  parade  us  through  the  streets  in  chariots  on  a  regular  year.  kids  in 
costumes are silly, but aging victors, it turns out, are pitiful. a few who are on the younger 
side, like johanna and finnick, or whose bodies haven't fallen into disrepair, like seeder and 
brutus, can still manage to maintain a little dignity. but the majority, who are in the clutches 

of drink or morphling or illness,  look grotesque  in their costumes, depicting cows and trees 
and  loaves of  bread. last  year we chattered away  about each contestant, but tonight there's 
only the occasional comment. small wonder the crowd goes wild when peeta and i appear, 
looking so young and strong and beautiful in our brilliant costumes. the very image of what 
tributes should be.

 from districts 1, 2, and 4 join forces, possibly taking in a few other 
exceptional fighters, and hunt down the weaker competitors. 

“that's been our strategy, hasn't it? to train like careers?” counters haymitch. “and who 
makes up the career pack is generally agreed upon before the games begin. peeta barely got 
in with them last year.” 

i think of the loathing i felt when i discovered peeta was with the careers during the last 

games. “so we're to try to get in with finnick and brutus — is that what you're saying?” 

“not necessarily. everyone's a  victor. make  your own pack  if  you'd rather. choose who 
you like. i'd suggest chaff and seeder. although finnick's not to be ignored,” says haymitch. 
“find someone to team up with who might be of some use to you. remember, you're not in a 
ring  full of trembling children  anymore. these people  are all experienced killers,  no  matter 
what shape they appear to be in.” 

maybe he's right. only who could i trust? s

the youngest, it's even more important we look self-reliant. so she has to satisfy herself with 
taking us to the elevator, fussing over our hair, and pushing the button for us. 

it's such a  short ride that there's  no real time  for  conversation,  but when peeta takes  my 
hand,  i  don't  pull  it  away.  i  may  have  ignored  him  last  night  in  private,  but  in  training  we 
must appear as an inseparable team. 

effie  needn't have worried about  us being the  last to  arrive. only  brutus and the woman 
from  district  2,  enobaria,  are  present.  enobaria  looks  to  be  about  thirty  and  all  i  can 
remember about her  is that,  in  hand-to-hand combat, she killed one tribute by ripping open 
his throat with her teeth. she became so famous for this act that, after she was a victor, she 
had her teeth cosmetically altered so each one ends in a sharp point like a fang and is inlaid 
with gold. she has no shortage of admirers in the capitol.

training, begins her spiel right on time, unfazed by the poor attendance. maybe she expected 
it. i'm sort of relieved, because that means there are a dozen people i don't have to pretend to 

make  friends  with.  atala  runs  through  the  list  of  stations,  which  include  both  combat  and 
survival skills, and releases us to train. 

i tell peeta i think we'd do best to split up, thus covering more territory. when he goes off 
to chuck spears with brutus and chaff, i head over to the knot-tying station, hardly anyone 
ever bothers to visit it. i like the trainer and he remembers me fondly, maybe because i spent 
time with him last year. he's pleased when i show him i can still set the trap that leaves an 
enemy dangling by a leg from a tree. clearly he took note of my snares in the arena last year 
and now sees me as an advanced pupil, so i ask him to review every kind of knot that might 
come  in  handy  and  a  few  that  i'll  probably  neve

when we're called to eat, haymitch pounces on me immediately. “so at least half the victors 
have  instructed  their  mentors  to  request  you  as  an  ally.  i  know  it  can't  be  your  sunny 
personality.” 

“they saw her shoot,” says peeta with a smile. “actually, i saw her shoot, for real, for the 

first time. i'm about to put in a formal request myself.” 

“you're that good?” haymitch asks me. “so good that brutus wants you?” 

i shrug. “but i don't want brutus. i want mags and district three.” 

“of course you do.” haymitch sighs and orders a bottle of wine. “i'll tell everybody you're 

still making up your mind.” 

after  my  shooting  exhibition,  i  still  get  teased  some,  but  i  no  longer  feel  like  i'm  being 
mocked.  in  fact,  i  feel  as  if  i've  somehow  been  initiated  into the  victors'  circle.  during  the

“that's just what we were thinking,” i tell him. 

we finish the meal in silence, but when we rise to go into the sitting room, cinna puts his 

arm around me and gives me a squeeze. “come on and let's go get those training scores.” 

we  gather  around  the  television  set  and  a  red-eyed  effie  rejoins  us.  the  tributes'  faces 
come up, district by district, and their scores flash under their pictures. one through twelve. 

predictably high scores for cashmere, gloss, brutus, enobaria, and finnick. low to medium 
for the rest. 

“have they ever given a zero?” i ask. 

“no, but there's a first time for everything,” cinna answers. 

and it turns out he's right. because when peeta and i each pull a twelve, we make hunger 

games history. no one feels like celebrating, though. 

“why did they do that?” i ask.

the  tributes  begin  their  interviews.  this  is  the  first  time  i  realize  the  depth  of  betrayal  felt 
among  the  victors  and  the  rage  that  accompanies  it.  but  they  are  so  smart,  so  wonderfully 
smart  about  how  they  play  it,  because  it  all  comes  back  to  reflect  on  the  government  and 
president  snow  in  particular.  not  everyone.  there  are  the  old  throwbacks,  like  brutus  and 
enobaria,  who  are  just  here  for  another  games,  and  those  too  baffled  or  drugged or  lost to 
join  in  on  the  attack.  but there  are  enough  victors  who  still  have  the  wits  and  the  nerve  to 
come out fighting.

she thinks of how much the people in the capitol must be suffering because they will lose us.

their sorrow. their loss. i turn spontaneously to chaff and offer my hand. i feel my fingers 
close around the stump that now completes his arm and hold fast. 

and  then  it  happens.  up  and  down  the  row, the  victors  begin  to  join  hands.  some  right 
away, like the morphlings, or wiress and beetee. others unsure but caught up in the demands 
of those around them, like brutus and enobaria. by the time the anthem plays its final strains, 
all twenty-four of us stand in one unbroken line in what must be the first public show of unity 
among  the  districts  since  the  dark  days.  you  can  see  the  realization  of  this  as  the  screens 
begin  to  pop  into  blackness.  it's  too  late, though.  in  the  confusion  they  didn't  cut  us  off  in

i shoot an arrow at enobaria, who's gotten in too close for comfort, but she's expecting it 
and dives back into the water before it can find its mark. gloss isn't quite as swift, and i sink 
an arrow into his calf as he plunges into the waves. i sling an extra bow and a second sheath 
of  arrows over  my  body,  slide  two  long  knives  and  an  awl  into  my  belt,  and  meet  up  with 
finnick at the front of the pile. 

“do something about that, would you?” he says. i see brutus barreling toward us. his belt 
is undone and he has it stretched between his hands as a kind of shield. i shoot at him and he 
manages to block the arrow with  his  belt before  it can  skewer  his  liver. where  it punctures 
the  belt,  a  purple  liquid  spews  forth,  coating  his  face.  as  i  reload,  brutus  flattens  on  the 
ground, rolls the few feet to the water, and submerges. there's a clang of metal falling behind 
me. “let's clear out,” i say to finnick.

might be willing to take them on with finnick by my side. but it's peeta i'm thinking about. i 
spot  him  now,  still  stranded  on  his  metal  plate.  i  take  off  and  finnick  follows  without 
question,  as  if  knowing  this  will  be  my  next  move.  when  i'm  as  close  as  i  can  get,

oh, right. i'm supposed to be pregnant, i think. while i'm trying to think what that means 
and how i should act—maybe throw up or something—finnick has positioned himself at the 
edge of the water. 

“cover me,” he says. he disappears with a flawless dive. 

i  raise  my  bow,  warding  off  any  attackers  from  the  cornucopia,  but  no  one  seems 

interested in pursuing us. 

sure  enough,  gloss,  cashmere,  enobaria,  and  brutus  have  gathered,  their  pack  formed 
already, picking over the weapons. a quick survey of the rest of the arena shows that most of 
the tributes are still trapped on their plates. wait, no, there's someone standing on the spoke 
to  my  left,  the one  opposite  peeta.  it's  mags.  but  she  neither  heads  for the  cornucopia  nor 
tries to flee. instead she splashes into the water and starts paddling toward me, her gray head 
bobbing above the waves. well, she's old, but i guess after eigh

say. 

“no,” finnick repeats. “because whatever happened in the past is in the past. and no one 

in this arena was a victor by chance.” he eyes peeta for a moment. “except maybe peeta.” 

finnick  knows  then  what  haymitch  and  i  know.  about  peeta.  being  truly,  deep-down 
better than the rest of us. finnick took out that tribute from 5 without  blinking an eye. and 
how  long  did  i  take  to  turn  deadly?  i  shot  to  kill  when  i  targeted  enobaria  and  gloss  and 
brutus.  peeta  would  at  least  have  attempted  negotiations  first.  seen  if  some  wider  alliance 
was  possible.  but  to  what  end?  finnick's  right.  i’m  right.  the  people  in  this  arena  weren't 
crowned for their compassion. 

i hold his gaze, weighing his speed against my own. the time it will take to send an arrow 
through his brain versus the time his trident will reach my body. i can see him, waiting for me 
to make the first move. calculating if he should block first or go di

y think that finnick 
would stand a better chance of winning if he had peeta and me as allies? the haggard look on 
finnick's face tells me that now is not the moment to ask. 

instead  i  try  to  put  myself  back  together.  i  rescue  my  mockingjay  pin  from  my  ruined 
jumpsuit  and  pin  it  to  the  strap  of  my  undershirt.  the  flotation  belt  must  be  acid  resistant, 
since  it  looks  as  good  as  new.  i  can  swim,  so  the  flotation  belt's  not  really  necessary,  but 
brutus  blocked  my  arrow  with  his,  so  i  buckle  it  back  on,  thinking  it  might  offer  some 
protection. i undo my hair and comb it with my fingers, thinning it out considerably since the 
fog droplets damaged it. then i braid back what's left of it. 

peeta has found a good tree about ten yards from the narrow strip of beach. we can hardly 
see him, but the sound of his knife against the wooden trunk is crystal clear. i wonder what

ore than we knew this morning, anyway.” 

we all nod in agreement, and that's when i  notice it. the silence. our canary has stopped 

singing. 

i don't wait. i load an arrow as i twist and get a  glimpse of a dripping-wet gloss  letting 
wiress slide to the ground, her throat slit open in a bright red smile. the point of my arrow 
disappears into his right temple, and in the instant it takes to reload, johanna has buried an ax 
blade  in  cashmere's  chest.  finnick  knocks  away  a  spear  brutus  throws  at  peeta  and  takes 
enobaria's  knife  in  his  thigh.  if  there  wasn't  a  cornucopia  to  duck  behind,  they'd  be  dead, 
both  of  the  tributes  from  district  2.  i  spring  forward  in  pursuit. boom!  boom!  boom! the 
cannon confirms there's no way to help wiress, no need to finish off gloss or cashmere. my 
allies  and  i  are  rounding  the  horn,  starting  to  give  chase  to  brutus  and  enobaria,  who  are 
sprinting down a sand strip toward the jungle.

my comment on the sun. but i just nod my  head  like i've been on the same page all along. 
“yes, so any one of these paths could lead to twelve o'clock,” i say. 

we  circle  around  the  cornucopia,  scrutinizing  the  jungle.  it  has  a  baffling  uniformity.  i 
remember the tall tree that took the  first  lightning strike at twelve o'clock,  but every  sector 
has a similar tree. johanna thinks to follow enobaria's and brutus's tracks, but they have been 
blown  or  washed  away.  there's  no  way  to  tell  where  anything  is.  “i  should  have  never 
mentioned the clock,” i say bitterly. “now they've taken that advantage away as well.” 

“only temporarily,” says beetee. “at ten, we'll see the wave again and be back on track.” 

“yes, they can't redesign the whole arena,” says peeta.

and that it has to do with peeta. i retrace our steps, starting from the moment the gong rang 
out, searching  for the source of  my discomfort. finnick towing peeta in off  his  metal plate. 
finnick  reviving  peeta  after the  force  field  stopped  his  heart.  mags  running  into the  fog  so 
that  finnick  could  carry  peeta.  the  morphling  hurling  herself  in  front  of  him  to  block  the 
monkey's  attack. the  fight with the careers was  so quick,  but didn't finnick  block brutus's 
spear  from  hitting peeta even though  it  meant taking enobaria's knife  in  his  leg?  and  even 
now johanna has him drawing a map on a leaf rather than risking the jungle... 

there  is  no  question  about  it.  for  reasons  completely  unfathomable  to  me,  some  of  the 

other victors are trying to keep him alive, even if it means sacrificing themselves. 

i'm dumbfounded. for one thing, that's  my  job. for another, it doesn't  make  sense. only 
one  of  us  can  get  out.  so

i stop peeta's practice, on the pretext of showing him how to rid himself of the itchy scabs, 

and as we scrub ourselves, i bring up our escape. 

“look, the  pool  is  down  to  eight.  i  think  it's  time  we  took  off,”  i  say  under  my  breath, 

although i doubt any of the tributes can hear me. 

peeta nods, and i can see him considering my proposition. weighing if the odds will be in 
our favor. “tell you what,” he says. “let's stick around until brutus and enobaria are dead. i 
think beetee's trying to put together some kind of trap for them now. then, i promise, we'll 
go.” 

i'm not entirely convinced. but if we leave now, we'll have two sets of adversaries after us. 
maybe  three,  because  who  knows  what  chaff's  up to?  plus  the  clock  to  contend  with.  and 
then there's beetee to think of. johanna only brought him for me, and if we leave she'll surely 
kill him. then i remember. i can't protect beetee, too. there can only be o

come  out  the  same  pink  as  the  sky.  we  apply  another  round  of  medicine  because  the  skin 
seems too delicate for the sunlight, but it doesn't look half as bad on smooth skin and will be 
good camouflage in the jungle. 

beetee calls us over, and it turns out that during all those hours of fiddling with wire, he 
has  indeed  come  up  with  a  plan.  “i  think  we'll  all  agree  our  next  job  is  to  kill  brutus  and 
enobaria,”  he  says  mildly.  “i  doubt  they'll  attack  us  openly  again,  now  that  they're  so 
outnumbered. we could track them down, i suppose, but it's dangerous, exhausting work.” 

“do you think they've figured out about the clock?” i ask. 

“if they haven't, they'll figure it out soon enough. perhaps not as specifically as we have. 
but  they  must  know  that  at  least  some  of  the  zones  are  wired  for  attacks  and  that  they're

“or not,” i mutter, since she's always pretty much rabid, but i don't stop him, because i'd 

be angry myself if i was excluded from a plan at this point. 

when she's joined us, beetee shoos us all back a bit so he can have room to work in the 
sand. he swiftly draws a circle and divides it into twelve wedges. it's the arena, not rendered 
in-peeta's precise strokes but in the rough lines of a man whose mind is occupied by other, far 
more complex things. “if you were brutus and enobaria, knowing what you do now about the 
jungle, where would you feel safest?” beetee asks. there's nothing patronizing  in his voice, 
and yet i can't help thinking he reminds me of a schoolteacher about to ease children into a 
lesson. perhaps it's the age difference, or simply that beetee is probably about a million times 
smarter than the rest of us. 

“where we are now. on the beach,” says peeta. “it's the safest place.” 

“so why aren't they on the beach?” says beete

we are like schoolchildren. completely unable to dispute his theory with anything but the 
most elementary concerns. most of which don't even have anything to do with his actual plan. 
i look at the others' disconcerted faces. “why not?” i say. “if it fails, there's no harm done. if 
it  works,  there's  a  decent  chance  we'll  kill  them.  and  even  if  we  don't  and  just  kill  the 
seafood, brutus and enobaria lose it as a food source, too.” 

“i say we try it,” says peeta. “katniss is right.” 

finnick  looks  at  johanna  and  raises  his  eyebrows.  he  will  not  go  forward  without  her. 
“all right,” she says finally. “it's better than hunting them down in the jungle, anyway. and i 
doubt they'll figure out our plan, since we can barely understand it ourselves.”
