im,
let antony look over caesar's head,
and speak as loud as mars. by jupiter,
were i the wearer of antonius' beard,
i would not shave't to-day.

lepidus.
'tis not a time
for private stomaching.

enobarbus.
every time
serves for the matter that is then born in't.

lepidus.
but small to greater matters must give way.

enobarbus.
not if the small come first.

lepidus.
your speech is passion:
but, pray you, stir no embers up. here comes
the noble antony.

enobarbus.
and yonder, caesar.

[enter caesar, maecenas, and agrippa.]

antony.
if we compose well here, to parthia;
hark, ventidius.

caesar.
i do not know,
maecenas; ask agrippa.

lepidus.
noble friends,
that which combin'd us was most great, and let not
a leaner action rend us. what's amiss,
may it be gently heard: when we debate
our trivial difference loud, we do commit
murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,--
the rather for i earnestly beseech,--

to none but thee; no more but when to thee.
if thou dost play with him at any game,
thou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck
he beats thee 'gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens
when he shines by: i say again, thy spirit
is all afraid to govern thee near him;
but, he away, 'tis noble.

get thee gone:
say to ventidius i would speak with him:--

he shall to parthia.--be it art or hap,
he hath spoken true: the very dice obey him;--
and in our sports my better cunning faints
under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;
his cocks do win the battle still of mine,
when it is all to nought; and his quails ever
beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. i will to egypt:
and though i make this marriage for my peace,
i' the east my pleasure lies.

no, to my cabin.--

ventidius.
now, darting parthia, art thou struck; and now
pleas'd fortune does of marcus crassus' death
make me revenger.--bear the king's son's body
before our army.--thy pacorus, orodes,
pays this for marcus crassus.

silius.
noble ventidius,
whilst yet with parthian blood thy sword is warm

mesopotamia, and the shelters w

ventidius.
o silius, silius,
i have done enough: a lower place, note well,
may make too great an act; for learn this, silius,--
better to leave undone, than by our deed
acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
caesar and antony have ever won
more in their officer, than person: sossius,
one of my place in syria, his lieutenant,
for quick accumulation of renown,
which he achiev'd by the minute, lost his favour.

n; and ambition,
the soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss
than gain which darkens him.
i could do more to do antonius good,
but 'twould offend him; and in his offence
should my performance perish.

silius.
thou hast, ventidius, that
without the which a soldier and his sword
grants scarce distinction. thou wilt write to antony?

ventidius.
i'll humbly signify what in his name,
that magical word of war, we have effected;
how, with his banners, and his well-paid ranks,
the ne'er-yet-beaten horse of parthia
we have jaded out o' the field.

silius.
where is he now?

ventidius.
he purposeth to athens: whither, with what haste
the weight we must convey with's will permit,
we shall appear before him.--on, there; pass along!
