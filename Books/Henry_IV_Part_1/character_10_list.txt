Owain Glyndwr - 
 The leader of the Welsh rebels and the father of Lady
Mortimer (most editions of 
1 Henry
IV refer to him as Owen Glendower). Glyndwr
joins with the Percys in their insurrection against King Henry.
Well-read, educated in England, and very capable in battle, he is
also steeped in the traditional lore of Wales and claims to be able
to command great magic. He is mysterious and superstitious and sometimes
acts according to prophecies and omens.
