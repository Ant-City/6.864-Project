where, like arion on the dolphin's back,
i saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
so long as i could see.

viola.
for saying so, there's gold:
mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
whereto thy speech serves for authority,
the like of him. know'st thou this country?

captain.
ay, madam, well; for i was bred and born
not three hours' travel from this very place.

viola.
who governs here?

captain.
a noble duke, in nature as in name.

viola.
what is his name?

captain.
orsino.

viola.
orsino! i have heard my father name him;
he was a bachelor then.

captain.
and so is now, or was so very late;
for but a month ago i went from hence,
and then 'twas fresh in murmur--as, you know,
what great ones do the less will prattle of--
that he did seek the love of fair olivia.

viola.
what's she?

captain.
a virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
that died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
in the protection of his son, her brother,
who shortly also died

[re-enter maria.]

maria.
madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to
speak with you.

olivia.
from the count orsino, is it?

maria.
i know not, madam; 't is a fair young man, and well attended.

olivia.
who of my people hold him in delay?

maria.
sir toby, madam, your kinsman.

olivia.
fetch him off, i pray you; he speaks nothing but madman: fie on
him! [exit maria.] go you, malvolio: if it be a suit from the
count, i am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.
[exit malvolio.] now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old,
and people dislike it.

olivia.
speak to me; i shall answer for her. your will?

viola.
most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty,-- i pray you,
tell me if this be the lady of the house, for i never saw her: i
would be loth to cast away my speech; for, besides that it is
excellently well penn'd, i have taken great pains to con it. good
beauties, let me sustain no scorn; i am very comptible, even to

egan rudely. what are you? what would you?

viola.
the rudeness that hath appear'd in me have i learn'd from my
entertainment. what i am, and what i would, are as secret as
maidenhead; to your ears, divinity; to any other's, profanation.

olivia.
give us the place alone; we will hear this divinity.
[exeunt maria and attendants.] now, sir, what is your text?

viola.
most sweet lady,--

olivia.
a comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it. where lies
your text?

viola.
in orsino's bosom.

olivia.
in his bosom! in what chapter of his bosom?

viola.
to answer by the method, in the first of his heart.

olivia.
o, i have read it; it is heresy. have you no more to say?

viola.
good madam, let me see your face.

olivia.
have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face?
you are now out of your text; but we will draw the curtain, and
show you the picture. look you, sir, such a one i was this
present; is 't not well done?

antonio.
pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.

sebastian.
o good antonio, forgive me your trouble!

antonio.
if you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant.

sebastian.
if you will not undo what you have done, that is, kill him whom
you have recover'd, desire it not. fare ye well at once; my bosom
is full of kindness, and i am yet so near the manners of my
mother that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
tales of me. i am bound to the count orsino's court; farewell.
[exit.]

antonio.
the gentleness of all the gods go with thee!
i have many enemies in orsino's court,
else would i very shortly see thee there.
but, come what may, i do adore thee so
that danger shall seem sport, and i will go.

i do not care for you: if that be to care for nothing, sir, i
would it would make you invisible.

viola.
art not thou the lady olivia's fool?

clown.
no, indeed, sir; the lady olivia has no folly: she will keep no
fool, sir, till she be married; and fools are as like husbands as
pilchards are to herrings, the husband's the bigger. i am,
indeed, not her fool, but her corrupter of words.

viola.
i saw thee late at the count orsino's.

clown.
foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun, it shines
everywhere. i would be sorry, sir, but the fool should be as oft
with your master as with my mistress. i think i saw your
wisdom there.

nay, and thou pass upon me, i'll no more with thee.   hold,
there's expenses for thee.

my duty, madam, and most humble service.

olivia.
what is your name?

viola.
cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.

olivia.
my servant, sir! 't was never merry world
since lowly feigning was call'd compliment;
you're servant to the count orsino, youth.

viola.
and he is yours, and his must needs be yours;
your servant's servant is your servant, madam.

olivia.
for him, i think not on him; for his thoughts,
would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!

viola.
madam, i come to whet your gentle thoughts
on his behalf.

olivia.
o, by your leave, i pray you,
i bade you never speak again of him;
but, would you undertake another suit,
i had rather hear you to solicit that
than music from the spheres.

madam, the young gentleman of the count orsino's is return'd: i

pleasure.

i'll come to him. [exit servant] good maria, let this fellow be
look'd to. where's my cousin toby? let some of my people have a
special care of him; i would not have him miscarry for the half
of my dowry.

i must obey. [to viola] this comes with seeking you:
but there's no remedy; i shall answer it.
what will you do, now my necessity
makes me to ask you for my purse? it grieves me
much more for what i cannot do for you
than what befalls myself. you stand amaz'd;
but be of comfort.

duke.
that face of his i do remember well;
yet, when i saw it last, it was besmear'd
as black as vulcan in the smoke of war.
a baubling vessel was he captain of,
for shallow draught and bulk unprizable;
with which such scathful grapple did he make
with the most noble bottom of our fleet
that very envy and the tongue of loss
cried fame and honour on him. what 's the matter?

1 officer.
orsino, this is that antonio
that took the phoenix and her fraught from candy;
and this is he that did the tiger board,
when your young nephew titus lost his leg.
here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,
in private brabble did we apprehend him.

viola.
he did me kindness, sir; drew on my side;
but in conclusion put strange speech upon me;
i know not what 't was but distraction.

orsino, noble sir,
be pleas'd that i shake off these names you give me;
antonio never yet was thief or pirate,
though, i confess, on base and ground enough,
orsino's enemy. a witchcraft drew me hither:
that most ingrateful boy there by your side,
from the rude sea's enrag'd and foamy mouth
did i redeem; a wreck past hope he was.
his life i gave him, and did thereto ad
my love, without retention or restraint,
all his in dedication; for his sake
did i expose myself, pure for his love,
into the danger of this adverse town;
drew to defend him when he was beset:
where being apprehended, his false cunning,
not meaning to partake with me in danger,
