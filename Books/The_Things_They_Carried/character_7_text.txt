 jungles. you knew where
you  stood.  you  knew  the  score.  the  pieces  were  out  on  the  board,  the
enemy  was  visible,  you  could  watch  the  tactics  unfolding  into  larger
strategies. there was a winner and a loser. there were rules.




i'm forty-three years old, and a writer now, and the war has been over
for a long while. much of it is hard to remember. i sit at this typewriter
and  stare  through  my  words  and  watch  kiowa  sinking  into  the  deep
muck of a shit field, or curt lemon hanging in pieces from a tree, and as
i  write  about  these  things,  the  remembering  is  turned  into  a  kind  of
rehappening.  kiowa  yells  at  me.  curt  lemon  steps  from  the  shade  into
bright sunlight, his face brown and shining, and then he soars into a tree.
the  bad  stuff  never  stops  happening:  it  lives  in  its  own  dimension,
replaying itself over and over.

but the war wasn't all that way.

it's all exactly true.
it happened, to me, nearly twenty years ago, and i still remember that
trail junction and those giant trees and a soft dripping sound somewhere
beyond the trees. i remember the smell of moss. up in the canopy there
were  tiny  white  blossoms,  but  no  sunlight  at  all,  and  i  remember  the
shadows spreading out under the trees where curt lemon and rat kiley
were  playing  catch  with  smoke  grenades.  mitchell  sanders  sat  flipping
his yo-yo. norman bowker and kiowa and dave jensen were dozing, or
half dozing, and all around us were those ragged green mountains.

except for the laughter things were quiet.
at one point, i remember, mitchell sanders turned and looked at me,
not  quite  nodding,  as  if  to  warn  me  about  something,  as  if  he  already
knew, then after a while he rolled up his yo-yo and moved away.

in  any  war  story,  but  especially  a  true  one,  it's  difficult  to  separate
what  happened  from  what  seemed  to  happen.  what  seems  to  happen
becomes  its  own  happening  and  has  to  be  told  that  way.  the  angles  of
vision are skewed. when a booby trap explodes, you close your eyes and
duck and float outside yourself. when a guy dies, like curt lemon, you
look away and then look back for a moment and then look away again.
the  pictures  get  jumbled;  you  tend  to  miss  a  lot.  and  then  afterward,
when  you  go  to  tell  about  it,  there  is  always  that  surreal  seemingness,
which  makes  the  story  seem  untrue,  but  which  in  fact  represents  the
hard and exact truth as it seemed.


in many cases a true war story cannot be believed. if you believe it, be
skeptical.  it's  a  question  of  credibility.  often  the  crazy  stu

did  not  make  a  sound.  it  went  down  hard,  then  got  up  again,  and  rat
took careful aim and shot off an ear. he shot it in the hindquarters and in



the little hump at its back. he shot it twice in the flanks. it wasn't to kill;
it was to hurt. he put the rifle muzzle up against the mouth and shot the
mouth  away.  nobody  said  much.  the  whole  platoon  stood  there
watching, feeling all kinds of things, but there wasn't a great deal of pity
for the baby water buffalo. curt lemon was dead. rat kiley had lost his
best friend in the world. later in the week he would write a long personal
letter to the guy's sister, who would not write back, but for now it was a
question of pain. he shot off the tail. he shot away chunks of meat below
the ribs. all around us there was the smell of smoke and filth and deep
greenery,  and  the  evening  was  humid  and  very  hot.  rat  went  to
automatic. he shot randomly, almost casually, quick little spurts in the
belly and butt. then he

shining,  and  when  his  foot  touched  down,  in  that  instant,  he  must've
thought it was the sunlight that was killing him. it was not the sunlight.
it was a rigged 105 round. but if i could ever get the story right, how the
sun seemed to gather around him and pick him up and lift him high into
a tree, if i could somehow re-create the fatal whiteness of that light, the
quick glare, the obvious cause and effect, then you would believe the last
thing curt lemon believed, which for him must've been the final truth.


now  and  then,  when  i  tell  this  story,  someone  will  come  up  to  me
afterward and say she liked it. it's always a woman. usually it's an older
woman  of  kindly  temperament  and  humane  politics.  she'll  explain  that
as a rule she hates war stories; she can't understand why people want to

 put on a ghost mask and went out trick-
or-treating  on  halloween.  but  afterward  he  couldn't  stop  bragging.  he
kept  replaying  his  own  exploits,  tacking  on  little  flourishes  that  never
happened.  he  had  an  opinion  of  himself,  i  think,  that  was  too  high  for



his own good. or maybe it was the reverse. maybe it was a low opinion
that he kept trying to erase.

in any case, it's easy to get sentimental about the dead, and to guard

against that i want to tell a quick curt lemon story.

in february we were working an area of operations called the rocket
pocket, which got its name from the fact that the enemy sometimes used
the place to launch rocket attacks on the airfield at chu lai. but for us it
was  like  a  two-week  vacation.  the  ao  lay  along  the  south  china  sea,
where things had the feel of a resort, with white beaches and palm trees
and friendly little villages. it was a quiet time. no casualties, no contact
at all. as usual, though, the higher-ups coul

embarrassment  must've  turned  a  screw  in  his  head.  late  that  night  he
crept down to the dental tent. he switched on a flashlight, woke up the
young  captain,  and  told  him  he  had  a  monster  toothache.  a  killer,  he
saidâ€”like  a  nail  in  his  jaw.  the  dentist  couldn't  find  any  problem,  but
lemon  kept  insisting,  so  the  man  finally  shrugged  and  shot  in  the
novocain and yanked out a perfectly good tooth. there was some pain,
no doubt, but in the morning curt lemon was all smiles.

vietnam  was  full  of  strange  stories,  some  improbable,  some  well
beyond that, but the stories that will last forever are those that swirl back
and forth across the border between trivia and bedlam, the mad and the
mundane. this one keeps returning to me. i heard it from rat kiley, who
swore  up  and  down  to  its  truth,  although  in  the  end,  i'll  admit,  that
doesn't  amount  to  much  of  a  warranty.  among  the  men  in  alpha

the  land  itselfâ€”everything,  everywhereâ€”the  fireflies  and  paddies,  the

i was atrocityâ€”i was jungle fire, jungle drumsâ€”i was the blind stare in
the eyes of all those poor, dead, dumbfuck ex-pals of mineâ€”all the pale
young corpses, lee strunk and kiowa and curt lemonâ€”i was the beast

mitchell sanders nodded. he didn't know what to say. for a time they

sat watching the shadows come, then rat shook his head.

he said he'd done his best. he'd tried to be a decent medic. win some
and lose some, he said, but he'd tried hard. briefly then, rambling a little,
he talked about a few of the guys who were gone now, curt lemon and
kiowa and ted lavender, and how crazy it was that people who were so
incredibly alive could get so incredibly dead.

then he almost laughed.
"this whole war," he said. "you know what it is? just one big banquet.

the next morning he shot himself.
he took off his boots and socks, laid out his medical kit, doped himself

the lives of the dead


but this too is true: stories can save us. i'm forty-three years old, and a
writer now, and even still, right here, i keep dreaming linda alive. and
ted lavender, too, and kiowa, and curt lemon, and a slim young man i
killed,  and  an  old  man  sprawled  beside  a  pigpen,  and  several  others
whose bodies i once lifted and dumped into a truck. they're all dead. but
in a story, which is a kind of dreaming, the dead sometimes smile and sit
up and return to the world.

start  here:  a  body  without  a  name.  on  an  afternoon  in  1969  the
platoon took sniper fire from a filthy little village along the south china
sea.  it  lasted  only  a  minute  or  two,  and  nobody  was  hurt,

mind.  he  wasn't  dead,  just  laid-back.  there  were  christians
among us, like kiowa, who believed in the new testament stories of life
after death. other stories were passed down like legends from old-timer
to  newcomer.  mostly,  though,  we  had  to  make  up  our  own.  often  they
were exaggerated, or blatant lies, but it was a way of bringing body and



soul  back  together,  or  a  way  of  making  new  bodies  for  the  souls  to
inhabit. there was a story, for instance, about how curt lemon had gone
trick-or-treating on halloween. a dark, spooky night, and so lemon put
on  a  ghost  mask  and  painted  up  his  body  all  different  colors  and  crept
across a paddy to a sleeping villageâ€”almost stark naked, the story went,
just  boots  and  balls  and  an  m-16â€”and  in  the  dark  lemon  went  from
hootch to hootchâ€”ringing doorbells, he called itâ€”and a few hours later,
when  he  slipped  back  into  the  perimeter,  he  had  a  whole  sackful  of
goodies to share with his

standing  there,  and  he's  got  this  m-16  up  against  her  ear  and  he
whispers,  'hey,  mama-san,  trick  or  fuckin'  treat!'  then  he  takes  off  her
pj's. strips her right down. sticks the pajamas in his sack and tucks her
into bed and heads for the next hootch."

pausing a moment, rat kiley would grin and shake his head. "honest

to god," he'd murmur. "trick or treat. lemonâ€”there's one class act."

to listen to the story, especially as rat kiley told it, you'd never know
that curt lemon was dead. he was still out there in the dark, naked and
painted up, trick-or-treating, sliding from hootch to hootch in that crazy
white ghost mask. but he was dead.


in september, the day after linda died, i asked my father to take me
down  to  benson's  funeral  home  to  view  the  body.  i  was  a  fifth  grader
then;  i  was  curious.  on  the  drive  downtown  my  father  kept  his  eyes
straight ahead. at one point, i remember, he made a scratchy sound in
his throat. it took him a long
