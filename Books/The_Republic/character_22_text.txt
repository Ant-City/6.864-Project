f government make laws democratical,
aristocratical, tyrannical, with a view to their several interests;
and these laws, which are made by them for their own interests, are the
justice which they deliver to their subjects, and him who transgresses
them they punish as a breaker of the law, and unjust. and that is what
i mean when i say that in all states there is the same principle of
justice, which is the interest of the government; and as the government
must be supposed to have power, the only reasonable conclusion is, that
everywhere there is one principle of justice, which is the interest of
the stronger.

now i understand you, i said; and whether you are right or not i will
try to discover. but let me remark, that in defining justice you have
yourself used the word 'interest' which you forbade me to use. it is
true, however, that in your definition the words 'of the stronger' are
added.

a small addition, you must allow, he said.

great or small, never mind about that: we must first enqu

as ruler, whether in a state or in private life, could only regard the
good of his flock or subjects; whereas you seem to think that the rulers
in states, that is to say, the true rulers, like being in authority.

think! nay, i am sure of it.

then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take them willingly
without payment, unless under the idea that they govern for the
advantage not of themselves but of others? let me ask you a question:
are not the several arts different, by reason of their each having a
separate function? and, my dear illustrious friend, do say what you
think, that we may make a little progress.

yes, that is the difference, he replied.

and each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general
one--medicine, for example, gives us health; navigation, safety at sea,
and so on?

yes, he said.

and the art of payment has the special function of giving pay: but we do
not confuse this with other arts, any more than the art of the pilot is
to be confuse

y benefit from his art unless he were paid as well?

i suppose not.

but does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing?

certainly, he confers a benefit.

then now, thrasymachus, there is no longer any doubt that neither arts
nor governments provide for their own interests; but, as we were before
saying, they rule and provide for the interests of their subjects who
are the weaker and not the stronger--to their good they attend and
not to the good of the superior. and this is the reason, my dear
thrasymachus, why, as i was just now saying, no one is willing to
govern; because no one likes to take in hand the reformation of evils
which are not his concern without remuneration. for, in the execution of
his work, and in giving his orders to another, the true artist does not
regard his own interest, but always that of his subjects; and therefore
in order that rulers may be willing to rule, they must be paid in one of
three modes of payment, money, or honour, or a penalty for refus

ing.

what do you mean, socrates? said glaucon. the first two modes of payment
are intelligible enough, but what the penalty is i do not understand, or
how a penalty can be a payment.

you mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment which to
the best men is the great inducement to rule? of course you know that
ambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a disgrace?

very true.

and for this reason, i said, money and honour have no attraction for
them; good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing
and so to get the name of hirelings, nor by secretly helping themselves
out of the public revenues to get the name of thieves. and not being
ambitious they do not care about honour. wherefore necessity must be
laid upon them, and they must be induced to serve from the fear of
punishment. and this, as i imagine, is the reason why the forwardness
to take office, instead of wait
 
 ___________________________
 
dishonourable. now the worst part of the punishment is that he who
refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself.
and the fear of this, as i conceive, induces the good to take office,
not because they would, but because they cannot help--not under the idea
that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves, but as
a necessity, and because they are not able to commit the task of ruling
to any one who is better than themselves, or indeed as good. for there
is reason to think that if a city were composed entirely of good men,
then to avoid office would be as much an object of contention as to
obtain office is at present; then we should have plain proof that the
true ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest, but that
of his subjects; and every one who knew this would choose rather to
receive a benefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring
one. so far am i from agreeing with thrasymachus that justice is the
interest of the stronge

end we shall want judges to decide; but if we proceed in our
enquiry as we lately did, by making admissions to one another, we shall
unite the offices of judge and advocate in our own persons.

very good, he said.

and which method do i understand you to prefer? i said.

that which you propose.

well, then, thrasymachus, i said, suppose you begin at the beginning and
answer me. you say that perfect injustice is more gainful than perfect
justice?

yes, that is what i say, and i have given you my reasons.

and what is your view about them? would you call one of them virtue and
the other vice?

certainly.

i suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice?

what a charming notion! so likely too, seeing that i affirm injustice to
be profitable and justice not.

what else then would you say?

the opposite, he replied.

and would you call justice vice?

no, i would rather say sublime simplicity.

then would you call injustice malignity?

no; i would rather say discretion.

and do the

ed by you as by others to be vice and deformity, an answer
might have been given to you on received principles; but now i perceive
that you will call injustice honourable and strong, and to the unjust
you will attribute all the qualities which were attributed by us before
to the just, seeing that you do not hesitate to rank injustice with
wisdom and virtue.

you have guessed most infallibly, he replied.

then i certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the
argument so long as i have reason to think that you, thrasymachus, are
speaking your real mind; for i do believe that you are now in earnest
and are not amusing yourself at our expense.

i may be in earnest or not, but what is that to you?--to refute the
argument is your business.

very true, i said; that is what i have to do: but will you be so good
as answer yet one more question? does the just man try to gain any
advantage over the just?

far otherwise; if he did he would not be the simple amusing creature
which he is.

l they not quarrel and

they will.

and suppose injustice abiding in a single person, would your wisdom say
that she loses or that she retains her natural power?

let us assume that she retains her power.

yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature that
wherever she takes up her abode, whether in a city, in an army, in a
family, or in any other body, that body is, to begin with, rendered
incapable of united action by reason of sedition and distraction; and
does it not become its own enemy and at variance with all that opposes
it, and with the just? is not this the case?

yes, certainly.

and is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single person; in
the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is not
at unity with himself, and in the second place making him an enemy to
himself and the just? is not that true, thrasymachus?

yes.

and o my friend, i said, surely the gods are just?

they would have injured one another as well as their victims; they
were but half-villains in their enterprises; for had they been whole
villains, and utterly unjust, they would have been utterly incapable of
action. that, as i believe, is the truth of the matter, and not what you
said at first. but whether the just have a better and happier life than
the unjust is a further question which we also proposed to consider. i
think that they have, and for the reasons which i have given; but still
i should like to examine further, for no light matter is at stake,
nothing less than the rule of human life.

proceed.

i will proceed by asking a question: would you not say that a horse has
some end?

i should.

and the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could
not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other thing?

i do not understand, he said.

let me explain: can you see, except with the eye?

certainly not.

e of justice and injustice have not yet been
made clear. setting aside their rewards and results, i want to know what
they are in themselves, and how they inwardly work in the soul. if you,
please, then, i will revive the argument of thrasymachus. and first i
will speak of the nature and origin of justice according to the common
view of them. secondly, i will show that all men who practise justice do
so against their will, of necessity, but not as a good. and thirdly, i
will argue that there is reason in this view, for the life of the unjust
is after all better far than the life of the just--if what they say
is true, socrates, since i myself am not of their opinion. but still i
acknowledge that i am perplexed when i hear the voices of thrasymachus
and myriads of others dinning in my ears; and, on the other hand, i have
never yet heard the superiority of justice to injustice maintained by
any one in a satisfactory way. i want to hear justice praised in respect
of itself; then i shall be satis

lves to have neither; hence there arise
laws and mutual covenants; and that which is ordained by law is termed
by them lawful and just. this they affirm to be the origin and nature of
justice;--it is a mean or compromise, between the best of all, which is
to do injustice and not be punished, and the worst of all, which is to
suffer injustice without the power of retaliation; and justice, being at
a middle point between the two, is tolerated not as a good, but as
the lesser evil, and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do
injustice. for no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit
to such an agreement if he were able to resist; he would be mad if he
did. such is the received account, socrates, of the nature and origin of
justice.

now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because they
have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine something
of this kind: having given both to the just and the unjust power to do
what they will, let us wat

illing to lie, whether in
word or deed, or to put forth a phantom of himself?

i cannot say, he replied.

do you not know, i said, that the true lie, if such an expression may be
allowed, is hated of gods and men?

what do you mean? he said.

i mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest and
highest part of himself, or about the truest and highest matters; there,
above all, he is most afraid of a lie having possession of him.

still, he said, i do not comprehend you.

the reason is, i replied, that you attribute some profound meaning to
my words; but i am only saying that deception, or being deceived
or uninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of
themselves, which is the soul, and in that part of them to have and to
hold the lie, is what mankind least like;--that, i say, is what they
utterly detest.

there is nothing more hateful to them.

and, as i was just now remarking, this ignorance in the soul of him who
is deceived may be called the true lie; f
 
 ___________________________
 
is in certain cases useful and not hateful; in
dealing with enemies--that would be an instance; or again, when those
whom we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to
do some harm, then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or
preventive; also in the tales of mythology, of which we were just now
speaking--because we do not know the truth about ancient times, we make
falsehood as much like truth as we can, and so turn it to account.

very true, he said.

but can any of these reasons apply to god? can we suppose that he is
ignorant of antiquity, and therefore has recourse to invention?

that would be ridiculous, he said.

then the lying poet has no place in our idea of god?

i should say not.

or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies?

that is inconceivable.

but he may have friends who are senseless or mad?

but no mad or senseless person can be a friend of god.

then no motive can be imagined why god should lie?

none whatever.

then the superhuman an

that the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good man
who is his comrade.

yes; that is our principle.

and therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though he
had suffered anything terrible?

he will not.

such an one, as we further maintain, is sufficient for himself and his
own happiness, and therefore is least in need of other men.

true, he said.

and for this reason the loss of a son or brother, or the deprivation of
fortune, is to him of all men least terrible.

assuredly.

and therefore he will be least likely to lament, and will bear with the
greatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall him.

yes, he will feel such a misfortune far less than another.

then we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous men,
and making them over to women (and not even to women who are good for
anything), or to men of a baser sort, that

only to admit the pure imitator of virtue.

yes, i said, adeimantus, but the mixed style is also very charming: and
indeed the pantomimic, which is the opposite of the one chosen by you,
is the most popular style with children and their attendants, and with
the world in general.

i do not deny it.

but i suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our
state, in which human nature is not twofold or manifold, for one man
plays one part only?

yes; quite unsuitable.

and this is the reason why in our state, and in our state only, we
shall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also, and a
husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also, and a soldier a
soldier and not a trader also, and the same throughout?

true, he said.

and therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen, who are so
clever that they can imitate anything, comes to us, and makes a proposal
to exhibit himself and his poetry, we will fall down and worship him as

discern the true nature of the beautiful and graceful; then will our

shall flow into the eye and ear, like a health-giving breeze from a
purer region, and insensibly draw the soul from earliest years into

there can be no nobler training than that, he replied.

and therefore, i said, glaucon, musical training is a more potent
instrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way
into the inward places of the soul, on which they mightily fasten,
imparting grace, and making the soul of him who is rightly educated
graceful, or of him who is ill-educated ungraceful; and also because
he who has received this true education of the inner being will most

why; and when reason comes he will recognise and salute the friend with
whom his education has made him long familiar.

yes, he said, i quite agree with you in thinking that our youth should
be trained in music and on the grounds which you mention.

just as in learning to read, i said, we were satisfied when we knew
the letters of the alphabet, which are very few, in all their recurring
sizes and combinations; not slighting them as unimportant whether they
occupy a space large or small, but everywhere eager to make

art of medicine was not designed for their good, and though they were as
rich as midas, the sons of asclepius would have declined to attend them.

they were very acute persons, those sons of asclepius.

naturally so, i replied. nevertheless, the tragedians and pindar
disobeying our behests, although they acknowledge that asclepius was the
son of apollo, say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man
who was at the point of death, and for this reason he was struck by
lightning. but we, in accordance with the principle already affirmed by
us, will not believe them when they tell us both;--if he was the son of
a god, we maintain that he was not avaricious; or, if he was avaricious,
he was not the son of a god.

all that, socrates, is excellent; but i should like to put a question to
you: ought there not to be good physicians in a state, and are not the
best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions good
and bad? and are not

judge it is otherwise; since he governs mind by mind; he
ought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds, and to
have associated with them from youth upwards, and to have gone through
the whole calendar of crime, only in order that he may quickly infer
the crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from his own
self-consciousness; the honourable mind which is to form a healthy
judgment should have had no experience or contamination of evil habits
when young. and this is the reason why in youth good men often appear to
be simple, and are easily practised upon by the dishonest, because they
have no examples of what evil is in their own souls.

yes, he said, they are far too apt to be deceived.

therefore, i said, the judge should not be young; he should have learned
to know evil, not from his own soul, but from late and long observation
of the nature of evil in others: knowledge should be his guide, not
personal experience.

yes, he said, that is the ideal of a judge.

to defend her against attacks, and her citizens they are to regard as

whereas other men acq

a man, will determine his future life. does not like always attract

to be sure.

until some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good, and
may be the reverse of good?

that is not to be denied.

and for this reason, i said, i shall not attempt to legislate further
about them.

naturally enough, he replied.

well, and about the business of the agora, and the ordinary dealings
between man and man, or again about agreements with artisans; about
insult and injury, or the commencement of actions, and the appointment
of juries, what would you say? there may also arise questions about

be required, and in general about the regulations of markets,

y ignorance,
but by knowledge, do men counsel well?

clearly.

and the kinds of knowledge in a state are many and diverse?

of course.

there is the knowledge of the carpenter; but is that the sort of
knowledge which gives a city the title of wise and good in counsel?

certainly not; that would only give a city the reputation of skill in
carpentering.

then a city is not to be called wise because possessing a knowledge
which counsels for the best about wooden implements?

certainly not.

nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots, i said,
nor as possessing any other similar knowledge?

not by reason of any of them, he said.

nor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth; that would
give the city the name of agricultural?

yes.

well, i said, and is there any knowledge in our recently-founded state
among any of the citizens which advises, not about any particular thing
in the state, but about the whole, and considers how a state can best
deal with itself and wi
 
 ___________________________
 
nd is found among
those whom we were just now describing as perfect guardians.

and what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this
sort of knowledge?

the name of good in counsel and truly wise.

and will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more
smiths?

the smiths, he replied, will be far more numerous.

will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a
name from the profession of some kind of knowledge?

much the smallest.

and so by reason of the smallest part or class, and of the knowledge
which resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself, the whole
state, being thus constituted according to nature, will be wise; and
this, which has the only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom, has been
ordained by nature to be of all classes the least.

most true.

thus, then, i said, the nature and place in the state of one of the four
virtues has somehow or other been discovered.

and, in my humble opinion, very satisfactorily discov
 
 ___________________________
 
 the same person is denoted.

certainly.

the meaning is, i believe, that in the human soul there is a better and
also a worse principle; and when the better has the worse under control,
then a man is said to be master of himself; and this is a term of
praise: but when, owing to evil education or association, the better
principle, which is also the smaller, is overwhelmed by the greater mass
of the worse--in this case he is blamed and is called the slave of self
and unprincipled.

yes, there is reason in that.

and now, i said, look at our newly-created state, and there you will
find one of these two conditions realized; for the state, as you
will acknowledge, may be justly called master of itself, if the words
'temperance' and 'self-mastery' truly express the rule of the better
part over the worse.

yes, he said, i see that what you say is true.

let me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures and desires
and pains are generally found in children and women and servants, and in
t

he freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous class.

certainly, he said.

whereas the simple and moderate desires which follow reason, and are
under the guidance of mind and true opinion, are to be found only in a
few, and those the best born and best educated.

very true.

these two, as you may perceive, have a place in our state; and the
meaner desires of the many are held down by the virtuous desires and
wisdom of the few.

that i perceive, he said.

then if there be any city which may be described as master of its own
pleasures and desires, and master of itself, ours may claim such a
designation?

certainly, he replied.


 
 ___________________________
 
it may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons?

yes.

and if there be any state in which rulers and subjects will be agreed as
to the question who are to rule, that again will be our state?

undoubtedly.

and the citizens being thus agreed among themselves, in which class will
temperance be found--in the rulers or in the subjects?

in both, as i should imagine, he replied.

do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance
was a sort of harmony?

why so?

why, because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom, each of w

r souls.

that will be in regular course; let us do as you say.

i proceeded to ask: when two things, a greater and less, are called by
the same name, are they like or unlike in so far as they are called the
same?

like, he replied.

the just man then, if we regard the idea of justice only, will be like
the just state?

he will.

and a state was thought by us to be just when the three classes in the
state severally did their own business; and also thought to be temperate
and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections and qualities
of these same classes?

true, he said.

and so of the individual; we may assume that he has the same three
principles in his own soul which are found in the state; and he may be
rightly described in the same terms, because he is affected in the same
manner?

certainly, he said.

once more then, o my friend, we have alighted upon an easy
question--whether the soul has these three principles or not?

an easy question! nay, rather, socrates, the proverb ho
 
 ___________________________
 
h and pull the
bow at the same time, but what you say is that one hand pushes and the
other pulls.

exactly so, he replied.

and might a man be thirsty, and yet unwilling to drink?

yes, he said, it constantly happens.

and in such a case what is one to say? would you not say that there
was something in the soul bidding a man to drink, and something else
forbidding him, which is other and stronger than the principle which
bids him?

i should say so.

and the forbidding principle is derived from reason, and that which bids
and attracts proceeds from passion and disease?

clearly.

then we may fairly assume that they are two, and that they differ from
one another; the one with which a man reasons, we may call the rational
principle of the soul, the other, with which he loves and hungers and
thirsts and feels the flutterings of any other desire, may be termed
the irrational or appetitive, the ally of sundry pleasures and
satisfactions?

yes, he said, we may fairly assume them to be different.

ime he struggled and covered his eyes, but at length the desire
got the better of him; and forcing them open, he ran up to the dead
bodies, saying, look, ye wretches, take your fill of the fair sight.

i have heard the story myself, he said.

the moral of the tale is, that anger at times goes to war with desire,
as though they were two distinct things.

yes; that is the meaning, he said.

and are there not many other cases in which we observe that when a man's
desires violently prevail over his reason, he reviles himself, and is
angry at the violence within him, and that in this struggle, which is
like the struggle of factions in a state, his spirit is on the side of
his reason;--but for the passionate or spirited element to take part
with the desires when reason decides that she should not be opposed,
is a sort of thing which i believe that you never observed occurring in
yourself, nor, as i should imagine, in any one else?

certainly not.

suppose that a man thinks he has done a wrong to a
 
 ___________________________
 
erson may inflict
upon him--these he deems to be just, and, as i say, his anger refuses to
be excited by them.

true, he said.

but when he thinks that he is the sufferer of the wrong, then he boils
and chafes, and is on the side of what he believes to be justice; and
because he suffers hunger or cold or other pain he is only the more
determined to persevere and conquer. his noble spirit will not be
quelled until he either slays or is slain; or until he hears the voice
of the shepherd, that is, reason, bidding his dog bark no more.

the illustration is perfect, he replied; and in our state, as we were
saying, the auxiliaries were to be dogs, and to hear the voice of the
rulers, who are their shepherds.

i perceive, i said, that you quite understand me; there is, however, a
further point which i wish you to consider.

what point?

you remember that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be a kind
of desire, but now we should say quite the contrary; for in the conflict
of the soul spirit
 
 ___________________________
 
 is arrayed on the side of the rational principle.

most assuredly.

but a further question arises: is passion different from reason also, or
only a kind of reason; in which latter case, instead of three principles
in the soul, there will only be two, the rational and the concupiscent;
or rather, as the state was composed of three classes, traders,
auxiliaries, counsellors, so may there not be in the individual soul a
third element which is passion or spirit, and when not corrupted by bad
education is the natural auxiliary of reason?

yes, he said, there must be a third.

yes, i replied, if passion, which has already been shown to be different
from desire
 
 ___________________________
 
, turn out also to be different from reason.

but that is easily proved:--we may observe even in young children that
they are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born, whereas some
of them never seem to attain to the use of reason, and most of them late
enough.

excellent, i said, and you may see passion equally in brute animals,
which is a further proof of the truth of what you are saying. and we may
once more appeal to the words of homer, which have been already quoted
by us,

'he smote his breast, and thus rebuked his soul,'

for in this verse homer has clearly supposed the power which reasons
about the better and worse to be different from the unreasoning anger
which is rebuked by it.

very true, he said.

and so, af

we must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of
his nature do their own work will be just, and will do his own work?

yes, he said, we must remember that too.

and ought not the rational principle, which is wise, and has the care of
the whole soul, to rule, and the passionate or spirited principle to be
the subject and ally?

certainly.

and, as we were saying, the united influence of music and gymnastic will
bring them into accord, nerving and sustaining the reason with noble
words and lessons, and moderating and soothing and civilizing the
wildness of passion by harmony and rhythm?

quite true, he said.

and these two, thus nurtured and educated, and having learned truly to
know their own functions, will rule over the concupiscent, which in each
of us is the largest part of the soul and by nature most insatiable of
gain; over this they will keep guard, lest, waxing great and strong with
the fulness of bodily pleasures, as they are termed, the concupiscen

nfined to her own sphere, should attempt to enslave
and rule those who are not her natural-born subjects, and overturn the
whole life of man?

very true, he said.

both together will they not be the best defenders of the whole soul and
the whole body against attacks from without; the one counselling, and
the other fighting under his leader, and courageously executing his
commands and counsels?

true.

and he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure and
in pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to fear?

right, he replied.

and him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules, and
which proclaims these commands; that part too being supposed to have a
knowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of
the whole?

assuredly.

and would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements
in friendly harmony, in whom the one ruling principle of reason, and
the two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agree

ought to rule, and do not rebel?

certainly, he said, that is the true account of temperance whether in
the state or individual.

and surely, i said, we have explained again and again how and by virtue
of what quality a man will be just.

that is very certain.

and is justice dimmer in the individual, and is her form different, or
is she the same which we found her to be in the state?

there is no difference in my opinion, he said.

because, if any doubt is still lingering in our minds, a few c

likely than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver?
would any one deny this?

no one, he replied.

will the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft, or
treachery either to his friends or to his country?

never.

neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or
agreements?

impossible.

no one will be less likely to commit adultery, or to dishonour his
father and mother, or to fail in his religious duties?

no one.

and the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business,
whether in ruling or being ruled?

exactly so.

are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such
states is justice, or do you hope to discover some other?

not i, indeed.

then our dream has been realized; and the suspicion which we entertained
at the beginning of our work of construction, that some divine power
must have conducted us to a primary form of justice, has now been
verified?

yes, certainly.

and the division o

f labour which required the carpenter and the
shoemaker and the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own
business, and not another's, was a shadow of justice, and for that
reason it was of use?

clearly.

but in reality justice was such as we were describing, being concerned
however, not with the outward man, but with the inward, which is the
true self and concernment of man: for the just man does not permit the
several elements within him to interfere with one another, or any of
them to do the work of others,--he sets in order his own inner life, and
is his own master and his own law, and at peace with himself; and when
he has bound together the three principles within

 them, the hellenes were of the
opinion, which is still generally received among the barbarians, that
the sight of a naked man was ridiculous and improper; and when first the
cretans and then the lacedaemonians introduced the custom, the wits of
that day might equally have ridiculed the innovation.

no doubt.

but when experience showed that to let all things be uncovered was far
better than to cover them up, and the ludicrous effect to the outward
eye vanished before the better principle which reason asserted, then the
man was perceived to be a fool who directs the shafts of his ridicule
at any other sight but that of folly and vice, or seriously inclines to
weigh the beautiful by any other standard but that of the good.

very true, he replied.

first, then, whether the question is to be put in jest or in earnest,
let us come to an understanding about the nature of woman: is she
capable of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men, or
not at all? and is the art of war one of

acknowledged--did we not? that different natures ought to have different
pursuits, and that men's and women's natures are different. and now
what are we saying?--that different natures ought to have the same
pursuits,--this is the inconsistency which is charged upon us.

precisely.

verily, glaucon, i said, glorious is the power of the art of
contradiction!

why do you say so?

because i think that many a man falls into the practice against his
will. when he thinks that he is reasoning he is really disputing, just
because he cannot define and divide, and so know that of which he is
speaking; and he will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the spirit of
contention and not of fair discussion.

yes, he replied, such is very often the case; but what has that to do
with us and our argument?

a great deal; for there is certainly a danger of our getting
unintentionally into a verbal opposition.

in what way?

why we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth, that

to prevent the state from becoming either too large or too small.

certainly, he replied.

we shall have to invent some ingenious kind of lots which the less
worthy may draw on each occasion of our bringing them together, and then
they will accuse their own ill-luck and not the rulers.

to be sure, he said.

and i think that our braver and better youth, besides their other
honours and rewards, might have greater facilities of intercourse with
women given them; their bravery will be a reason, and such fathers ought
to have as many sons as possible.

true.

and the proper officers, whether male or female or both, for offices are
to be held by women as well as by men--

yes--

the proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to the
pen or fold, and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who
dwell in a separate quarter; but the offspring of the inferior, or of
the better when they chance to be deformed, will be put away in some
mysterious, unknown place, as th

marrying their sons or fathers, or son's son or father's father, and
so on in either direction. and we grant all this, accompanying the
permission with strict orders to prevent any embryo which may come into
being from seeing the light; and if any force a way to the birth, the
parents must understand that the offspring of such an union cannot be
maintained, and arrange accordingly.

that also, he said, is a reasonable proposition. but how will they know
who are fathers and daughters, and so on?

they will never know. the way will be this:--dating from the day of the
hymeneal, the bridegroom who was then married will call all the male
children who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterwards his
sons, and the female children his daughters, and they will call him
father, and he will call their children his grandchildren, and they will
call the elder generation grandfathers and grandmothers. all who w

most true.

and agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking, were we not saying
that they will have their pleasures and pains in common?

yes, and so they will.

and they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will
alike call 'my own,' and having this common interest they will have a
common feeling of pleasure and pain?

yes, far more so than in other states.

and the reason of this, over and above the general constitution of the
state, will be that the guardians will have a community of women and
children?

that will be the chief reason.

and this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good, as was
implied in our own comparison of a well-ordered state to the relation of
the body and the members, when affected by pleasure or pain?

that we acknowledged, and very rightly.

then the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly
the source of

very like a dog, he said.

then we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their burial?

yes, he replied, we most certainly must.

neither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods, least of all
the arms of hellenes, if we care to maintain good feeling with other
hellenes; and, indeed, we have reason to fear that the offering of
spoils taken from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by the god
himself?

very true.

again, as to the devastation of hellenic territory or the burning of
houses, what is to be the practice?

may i have the pleasure, he said, of hearing your opinion?

both should be forbidden, in my judgment; i would take the annual
produce and no more. shall i tell you why?

pray do.

why, you see, there is a difference in the names 'discord' and 'war,'
and i imagine that

ellenes fight with one another we shall say that hellas is
then in a state of disorder and discord, they being by nature friends;
and such enmity is to be called discord.

i agree.

consider then, i said, when that which we have acknowledged to be
discord occurs, and a city is divided, if both parties destroy the lands
and burn the houses of one another, how wicked does the strife appear!
no true lover of his country would bring himself to tear in pieces his
own nurse and mother: there might be reason in the conqueror depriving
the conquered of their harvest, but still they would have the idea of
peace in their hearts and would not mean to go on fighting for ever.

yes, he said, that is a better temper than the other.

and will not the city, which you are founding, be an hellenic city?

it ought to be, he replied.

then will not the citizens be good and civilized?

yes, very civilized.

and will they not be lovers of hellas, and think of hellas as their own
land, and share in the common temp

certainly.

they will use friendly correction, but will not enslave or destroy their
opponents; they will be correctors, not enemies?

just so.

and as they are hellenes themselves they will not devastate hellas, nor
will they burn houses, nor ever suppose that the whole population of a
city--men, women, and children--are equally their enemies, for they know
that the guilt of war is always confined to a few persons and that the
many are their friends. and for all these reasons they will be unwilling
to waste their lands and rase their houses; their enmity to them will
only last until the many innocent sufferers have compelled the guilty
few to give satisfaction?

i agree, he said, that our citizens should thus deal with their hellenic
enemies; and with barbarians as the hellenes now deal with one another.

then let us enact this law also for our guardians:--that they are
neither to devastate the lands of hellenes nor to burn their houses.

t. would that be your way of speaking?

yes.

and will you be so very good as to answer one more question? would you
say that knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place it?

certainly knowledge is a faculty, and the mightiest of all faculties.

and is opinion also a faculty?

certainly, he said; for opinion is that with which we are able to form
an opinion.

and yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not
the same as opinion?

why, yes, he said: how can any reasonable being ever identify that which
is infallible with that which errs?

an excellent answer, proving, i said, that we are quite conscious of a
distinction between them.

yes.

then knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct
spheres or subject-matters?

that is certain.

being is the sphere or subject-matter of knowledge, and knowledge is to
know the nature of being?

yes.

and opinion is to have an opinion?

yes.

if not already ordered, and to guard and preserve the order of them--are
not such persons, i ask, simply blind?

truly, he replied, they are much in that condition.

and shall they be our guardians when there are others who, besides being
their equals in experience and falling short of them in no particular of
virtue, also know the very truth of each thing?

there can be no reason, he said, for rejecting those who have this
greatest of all great qualities; they must always have the first place
unless they fail in some other respect.

suppose then, i said, that we determine how far they can unite this and
the other excellences.

by all means.

in the first place, as we began by observing, the nature of the
philosopher has to be ascertained. we must come to an understanding
about him, and, when we have done so, then, if i am not mistaken, we
shall also acknowledge that suc

a lie--but the truth is, that, when a man is ill, whether he
be rich or poor, to the physician he must go, and he who wants to
be governed, to him who is able to govern. the ruler who is good for
anything ought not to beg his subjects to be ruled by him; although
the present governors of mankind are of a different stamp; they may be
justly compared to the mutinous sailors, and the true helmsmen to those
who are called by them good-for-nothings and star-gazers.

precisely so, he said.

for these reasons, and among men like these, philosophy, the noblest
pursuit of all, is not likely to be much esteemed by those of the
opposite faction; not that the greatest and most lasting injury is done
to her by her opponents, but by her own professing followers, the same
of whom you suppose the accuser to say, that the greater number of them
are arrant rogues, and the best are useless; in which opinion i agreed.

yes.

and the reason why the good are useless has now been explained?

true.

nothing, he said, can be more just than such a description of him.

and will the love of a lie be any part of a philosopher's nature? will
he not utterly hate a lie?

he will.

and when truth is the captain, we cannot suspect any evil of the band
which he leads?

impossible.

justice and health of mind will be of the company, and temperance will
follow after?

true, he replied.

neither is there any reason why i should again set in array the
philosopher's virtues, as you will doubtless remember that courage,
magnificence, apprehension, memory, were his natural gifts. and you
objected that, although no one could deny what i then said, still, if
you leave words and look at facts, the persons who are thus described
are some of them manifestly useless, and the greater number utterly
depraved; we were then led to enquire into the grounds of these
accusations, and have now arrived at the point of askin
 
 ___________________________
 
and in the right way; you will then
have no difficulty in apprehending the preceding remarks, and they will
no longer appear strange to you.

and how am i to do so? he asked.

why, i said, we know that all germs or seeds, whether vegetable or
animal, when they fail to meet with proper nutriment or climate or soil,
in proportion to their vigour, are all the more sensitive to the want of
a suitable environment, for evil is a greater enemy to what is good than
to what is not.

very true.

there is reason in supposing that the finest natures, when under alien
conditions, receive more injury than the inferior, because the contrast
is greater.

certainly.

and may we not say, adeimantus, that the most gifted minds, when they
are ill-educated, become pre-eminently bad? do not great crimes and
the spirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by
education rather than from any inferiority, whereas weak natures are
scarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil?

there i thi

and in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment of
the tempers and tastes of the motley multitude, whether in painting
or music, or, finally, in politics, differ from him whom i have been
describing? for when a man consorts with the many, and exhibits to
them his poem or other work of art or the service which he has done
the state, making them his judges when he is not obliged, the so-called
necessity of diomede will oblige him to produce whatever they
praise. and yet the reasons are utterly ludicrous which they give in
confirmation of their own notions about the honourable and good. did you
ever hear any of them which were not?

no, nor am i likely to hear.

you recognise the truth of what i have been saying? then let me ask you
to consider further whether the world will ever be induced to believe in
the existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many beautiful, or
of the absolute in each kind rather than of the many in each kind?

certainly not.

to be sure he will.

now, when he is in this state of mind, if some one gently comes to him
and tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding, which can
only be got by slaving for it, do you think that, under such adverse
circumstances, he will be easily induced to listen?

far otherwise.

and even if there be some one who through inherent goodness or natural
reasonableness has had his eyes opened a little and is humbled and taken
captive by philosophy, how will his friends behave when they think that
they are likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping to reap
from his companionship? will they not do and say anything to prevent him
from yielding to his better nature and to render his teacher powerless,
using to this end private intrigues as well as public prosecutions?

there can be no doubt of it.

and how can one who is thus circumstanced ever b

ey ever did?

no indeed.

no, my friend, and they have seldom, if ever, heard free and noble
sentiments; such as men utter when they are earnestly and by every means
in their power seeking after truth for the sake of knowledge, while
they look coldly on the subtleties of controversy, of which the end is
opinion and strife, whether they meet with them in the courts of law or
in society.

they are strangers, he said, to the words of which you speak.

and this was what we foresaw, and this was the reason why truth forced
us to admit, not without fear and hesitation, that neither cities nor
states nor individuals will ever attain perfection until the small
class of philosophers whom we termed useless but not corrupt are
providentially compelled, whether they will or not, to take care of the
state, and until a like necessity be laid on the state to obey them; or
until kings, or if not kings, the sons of kings or princes, are divinely
inspired with a true love of true philosophy. that either or bo

quite right.

if then, in the countless ages of the past, or at the present hour in
some foreign clime which is far away and beyond our ken, the perfected
philosopher is or has been or hereafter shall be compelled by a superior
power to have the charge of the state, we are ready to assert to the

nothing can be more unbecoming in philosophers than this.

it is most unbecoming.

for he, adeimantus, whose mind is fixed upon true being, has surely no
time to look down upon the affairs of earth, or to be filled with malice
and envy, contending against men; his eye is ever directed towards
things fixed and immutable, which he sees neither injuring nor injured
by one another, but all in order moving according to reason; these he
imitates, and to these he will, as far as he can, conform himself. can a
man help imitating that with which he holds reverential converse?

impossible.

and the philosopher holding converse with the divine order, becomes
orderly and divine, as far as the nature of man allows; but like every
one else, he will suffer from detraction.

as rushing at us with might and main, that the painter of constitutions
is such an one as we are praising; at whom they were so very indignant
because to his hands we committed the state; and are they growing a

much calmer, if there is any sense in them.

why, where can they still find any ground for objection? will they doubt
that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being?

they would not be so unreasonable.

or that his nature, being such as we have delineated, is akin to the
highest good?

neither can they doubt this.

but again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under favourable
circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was? or
will they prefer those whom we have rejected?

surely not.

then will they still be angry at our saying, that, until philosophers
bear rule, states and individuals will have no rest from evil, nor will
this our imaginary state ever be

i think that they will be less angry.

shall we assume that they are not only less angry but quite gentle,
and that they have been converted and for very shame, if for no other
reason, cannot refuse to come to terms?

by all means, he said.

then let us suppose that the reconciliation has been effected. will any
one deny the other point, that there may be sons of kings or princes who
are by nature philosophers?

surely no man, he said.

and when they have come into being will any one say that they must of
necessity be destroyed; that they can hardly be saved is not denied even
by us; but that in the whole course of ages no single one of them can
escape--who will venture to a

figures and three kinds of angles and the like in their several branches
of science; these are their hypotheses, which they and every body are
supposed to know, and therefore they do not deign to give any account of
them either to themselves or others; but they begin with them, and go
on until they arrive at last, and in a consistent manner, at their
conclusion?

yes, he said, i know.

and do you not know also that although they make use of the visible
forms and reason about them, they are thinking not of these, but of the
ideals which they resemble; not of the figures which they draw, but
of the absolute square and the absolute diameter, and so on--the forms
which they draw or make, and which have shadows and reflections in water
of their own, are converted by them into images, but they are really
seeking to behold the things themselves, which can only be seen with the
eye of the mind?

that is true.

and of this kind i spoke as the intelligible, although in

resemblances in their turn as images, they having in relation to the

i understand, he said, that you are speaking of the province of geometry
and the sister arts.

and when i speak of the other division of the intelligible, you will
understand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason
herself attains by the power of dialectic, using the hypotheses not as
first principles, but only as hypotheses--that is to say, as steps and
points of departure into a world which is above hypotheses, in order
that she may soar beyond them to the first principle of the whole; and
clinging to this and then to that which depends on this, by successive
steps she descends again without the aid of any sensible object, from
ideas, through ideas, and in ideas she ends.

i understand you, he replied;

y, for you seem to me to
be describing a task which is really tremendous; but, at any rate, i
understand you to say that knowledge and being, which the science of
dialectic contemplates, are clearer than the notions of the arts, as
they are termed, which proceed from hypotheses only: these are also
contemplated by the understanding, and not by the senses: yet, because
they start from hypotheses and do not ascend to a principle, those who
contemplate them appear to you not to exercise the higher reason
upon them, although when a first principle is added to them they are
cognizable by the higher reason. and the habit which is concerned
with geometry and the cognate sciences i suppose that you would term
understanding and not reason, as being intermediate between opinion and
reason.

you have quite conceived my meaning, i said; and now, corresponding to
these four divisions, let there be four faculties in the soul--reason
answering to the highest, understanding to the second, faith (or

he will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and
the years, and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world, and
in a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have
been accustomed to behold?

clearly, he said, he would first see the sun and then reason about him.

himself on the change, and pity them?

world according to my poor belief, which, at your desire, i have
expressed--whether rightly or wrongly god knows. but, whether true or
false, my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good
appears last of all, and is seen only with an effort; and, when seen,
is also inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful and
right, parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible world,
and the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual; and
that this is the power upon which he who would act rationally either in
public or private life must have his eye fixed.

i agree, he said, as far as i am able to understand you.

moreover, i said, you must not wonder that those who attain to this
beatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs; for their
souls are ever hastening into the upper world where they desire to
dwell; which desire of theirs is very natural, if our allegory may be
trusted.

he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too
ready to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out
of the brighter life, and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the

of light. and he will count the one happy in his condition and state of

that, he said, is a very just distinction.

but then, if i am right, certain professors of education must be wrong
when they say that they can put a knowledge into the soul which was not

yes, i said, and now having spoken of it, i must add how charming the
science is! and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end, if
pursued in the spirit of a philosopher, and not of a shopkeeper!

how do you mean?

i mean, as i was saying, that arithmetic has a very great and elevating
effect, compelling the soul to reason about abstract number, and
rebelling against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into
the argument. you know how steadily the masters of the art repel and
ridicule any one who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is
calculating, and if you divide, they multiply (meaning either (1)
that they integrate the number because they deny the possibility of
fractions; or (2) that division is regarded by them as a process of
multiplication, for the fractions of one continue to be units.),
 
 ___________________________
 
 taking
care that one shall continue one and not become lost in fractions.

that is very true.

now, suppose a person were to say to them: o my friends, what are these
wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning, in which, as you say,
there is a unity such as you demand, and each unit is equal, invariable,
indivisible,--what would they answer?

they would answer, as i should conceive, that they were speaking of
those numbers which can only be realized in thought.

then you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary,
necessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in the
attainment of pure truth?

yes; that is a marked characteristic of it.

and have you further observed,
 
 ___________________________
 
 that those who have a natural talent for
calculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge; and
even the dull, if they have had an arithmetical training, although they
may derive no other advantage from it, always become much quicker than
they would otherwise have been.

very true, he said.

and indeed, you will not easily find a more difficult study, and not
many as difficult.

you will not.

and, for all these reasons, arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which
the best natures should be trained, and which must not be given up.

i agree.

let this then be made one of our subjects of education. and next, shall
we enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us?

you mean geometry?

exactly so.

clearly, he said, we are concerned with that part of geometry which
relates to war; for in pitching a camp, or taking up a position,
or closing or extending the lines of an army, or any other military
manoeuvre,

nt mainly on my own
behalf.

then take a step backward, for we have gone wrong in the order of the
sciences.

what was the mistake? he said.

after plane geometry, i said, we proceeded at once to solids in
revolution, instead of taking solids in themselves; whereas after the
second dimension the third, which is concerned with cubes and dimensions
of depth, ought to have followed.

that is true, socrates; but so little seems to be known as yet about
these subjects.

why, yes, i said, and for two reasons:--in the first place, no
government patronises them; this leads to a want of energy in the
pursuit of them, and they are difficult; in the second place, students
cannot learn them unless they have a director. but then a director
can hardly be found, and even if he could, as matters now stand,
the students, who are very conceited, would not attend to him. that,
however, would be otherwise if the whole state became the director of
these studies and gave honour to them; then disciples would want

r more conducive
to that knowledge of which we are speaking?

i will tell you, i said: the starry heaven which we behold is wrought
upon a visible ground, and therefore, although the fairest and most
perfect of visible things, must necessarily be deemed inferior far to
the true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness, which are
relative to each other, and carry with them that which is contained in
them, in the true number and in every true figure. now, these are to be
apprehended by reason and intelligence, but not by sight.

true, he replied.

the spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to that
higher knowledge; their beauty is like the beauty of figures or pictures
excellently wrought by the hand of daedalus, or some other great artist,
which we may chance to behold; any geometrician who saw them would
appreciate the exquisiteness of their workmanship, but he would never
dream of thinking that in them he could find the true equal or the true
double, or the

and to one another, and any other things that are material and visible
can also be eternal and subject to no deviation--that would be absurd;
and it is equally absurd to take so much pains in investigating their
exact truth.

i quite agree, though i never thought of this before.

then, i said, in astronomy, as in geometry, we should employ problems,
and let the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the right
way and so make the natural gift of reason to be of any real use.

that, he said, is a work infinitely beyond our present astronomers.

yes, i said; and there are many other things which must also have a
similar extension given to them, if our legislation is to be of any
value. but can you tell me of any other suitable study?

no, he said, not without thinking.

motion, i said, has many forms, and not one only; two of them are
obvious enough even to wits no better than ours; and there are others,
as i imagine, which may be left to wiser

ties, then, i think, but not till then, will the pursuit of them
have a value for our objects; otherwise there is no profit in them.

i suspect so; but you are speaking, socrates, of a vast work.

what do you mean? i said; the prelude or what? do you not know that all
this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn? for
you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as a dialectician?

assuredly not, he said; i have hardly ever known a mathematician who was
capable of reasoning.

but do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason
will have the knowledge which we require of them?

neither can this be supposed.

and so, glaucon, i said, we have at last arrived at the hymn of
dialectic. this is that strain which is of the intellect only, but which
the faculty of sight will nevertheless be found to imitate; for sight,
as you may remember, was imagined by us after a while to behold the
real animals and stars, and last of all the sun himself. and so wit

dialectic; when a person starts on the discovery of the absolute by
the light of reason only, and without any assistance of sense, and
perseveres until by pure intelligence he arrives at the perception
of the absolute good, he at last finds himself at the end of the
intellectual world, as in the case of sight at the end of the visible.

exactly, he said.

then this is the progress which you call dialectic?

true.

but the release of the prisoners from chains, and their translation
from the shadows to the images and to the light, and the ascent from the
underground den to the sun,

 which is given by opinion
and not by science;--dreaming and slumbering in this life, before he
is well awake here, he arrives at the world below, and has his final
quietus.

in all that i should most certainly agree with you.

and surely you would not have the children of your ideal state, whom you
are nurturing and educating--if the ideal ever becomes a reality--you
would not allow the future rulers to be like posts (literally 'lines,'
probably the starting-point of a race-course.), having no reason in
them, and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters?

certainly not.

then you will make a law that they shall have such an education as
will enable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering
questions?

yes, he said, you and i together will make it.

dialectic, then, as you will agree, is the coping-stone of the sciences,
and is set over them; no other science can be placed higher--the nature
of knowledge can no further go?

i agree, he said.

but to whom we are to

with the body.

very true, he replied.

further, he of whom we are in search should have a good memory, and be
an unwearied solid man who is a lover of labour in any line; or he will
never be able to endure the great amount of bodily exercise and to go
through all the intellectual discipline and study which we require of
him.

certainly, he said; he must have natural gifts.

the mistake at present is, that those who study philosophy have no
vocation, and this, as i was before saying, is the reason why she has
fallen into disrepute: her true sons should take her by the hand and not
bastards.

what do you mean?

in the first place, her votary should not have a lame or halting
industry--i mean, that he should not be half industrious and half idle:
as, for example, when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting, and all
other bodily exercises, but a hater rather than a lover of the labour
of learning or listening or enquiring. or the occupation to which he
devotes himself may be of an opposi

spend large sums on their wives, or on any others whom they please.

that is most true, he said.

and they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring the
money which they prize; they will spend that which is another man's on
the gratification of their desires, stealing their pleasures and running
away like children from the law, their father: they have been schooled
not by gentle influences but by force, for they have neglected her
who is the true muse, the companion of reason and philosophy, and have
honoured gymnastic more than music.

undoubtedly, he said, the form of government which you describe is a
mixture of good and evil.

why, there is a mixture, i said; but one thing, and one thing only, is
predominantly seen,--the spirit of contention and ambition; and these
are due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element.

assuredly, he said.

such is the origin and such the character of this state, which has been
described in outline only; the more perfe

 strongest of all, inasmuch as
the rule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of all.

this, then, will be the first great defect of oligarchy?

clearly.

and here is another defect which is quite as bad.

what defect?

the inevitable division: such a state is not one, but two states, the
one of poor, the other of rich men; and they are living on the same spot
and always conspiring against one another.

that, surely, is at least as bad.

another discreditable feature is, that, for a like reason, they are
incapable of carrying on any war. either they arm the multitude, and
then they are more afraid of them than of the enemy; or, if they do not
call them out in the hour of battle, they are oligarchs indeed, few to
fight as they are few to rule. and at the same time their fondness for
money makes them unwilling to pay taxes.

how discreditable!

and, as we said before, under such a constitution the same persons have
too many callings--they are husbandmen, tradesmen, warriors, all in one.

fear has taught him to knock ambition and passion headforemost from his

and miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together. is not such
an one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the
vacant throne and to suffer it to play the great king within him, girt
with tiara and chain and scimitar?

most true, he replied.

and when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground obediently
on either side of their sovereign, and taught them to know their place,
he compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be turned into
larger ones, and will not allow the other to worship and admire anything
but riches and rich men, or to be ambitious of anything so much as the
acquisition of wealth and the means of acquiring it.

do you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his
rogueries?

where must i look?

you should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting
dishonestly, as in the guardianship of an orphan.

aye.

it will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give
him a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad passions by an enforced
virtue; not making them see that they are wrong, or taming them by
reason, but by necessity and fear constraining them, and because he
trembles for his possessions.

to be sure.

yes, indeed, my dear friend, but you will find that the natural desires
of the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to spend
what is not his own.

yes, and they will be strong in him too.

the man, then, will be at war with himself; he will be two men, and not
one; but, in general, his better desires will be found to prevail over
his inferior ones.

has he not also another object, which is that they may be impoverished
by payment of taxes, and thus compelled to devote themselves to their
daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him?

clearly.

and if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom,
and of resistance to his authority, he will have a good pretext for
destroying them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy; and for all
these reasons the tyrant must be always getting up a war.

then some of those who joined in setting him up, and who are in power,
speak their minds to him and to one another, and the more courageous of
them cast in his teeth what is being done.

yes, that may be expected.

stop while he has a friend or an enemy who is good for anything.

he cannot.

why, you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence? what!

yes, he will, having first disarmed him.

then he is a parricide, and a cruel guardian of an aged parent; and this
is real tyranny, about which there can be no longer a mistake: as the
saying is, the people who would escape the smoke which is the slavery of
freemen, has fallen into the fire which is the tyranny of slaves. thus
liberty, getting out of all order and reason, passes into the harshest
and bitterest form of slavery.

true, he said.

very well; and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently
discussed the nature of tyranny, and the manner of the transition from
democracy to tyranny?

yes, quite enough, he said.




book ix.

ask, how is he formed out of the democratical? and how does he live, in
happiness or in misery?

yes, he said, he is the only one remaining.

there is, how

 which remains unanswered.

what question?

i do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number
of the appetites, and until this is accomplished the enquiry will always
be confused.

well, he said, it is not too late to supply the omission.

very true, i said; and observe the point which i want to understand:
certain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites i conceive to be
unlawful; every one appears to have them, but in some persons they are
controlled by the laws and by reason, and the better desires prevail
over them--either they are wholly banished or they become few and weak;
while in the case of others they are stronger, and there are more of
them.

which appetites do you mean?

i mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling
power is asleep; then the wild beast within us, gorged with meat or
drink, starts up and having shaken off sleep, goes forth to satisfy
his desires; and there is no conceivable folly or crime--not excepting
incest or any

es neither too much nor too little, but just
enough to lay them to sleep, and prevent them and their enjoyments and
pains from interfering with the higher principle--which he leaves in
the solitude of pure abstraction, free to contemplate and aspire to
the knowledge of the unknown, whether in past, present, or future: when
again he has allayed the passionate element, if he has a quarrel against
any one--i say, when, after pacifying the two irrational principles, he
rouses up the third, which is reason, before he takes his rest, then,
as you know, he attains truth most nearly, and is least likely to be the
sport of fantastic and lawless visions.

i quite agree.

in saying this i have been running into a digression; but the point
which i desire to note is that in all of us, even in good men, there is
a lawless wild-beast nature, which peers out in sleep. pray, consider
whether i am right, and you agree with me.

yes, i agree.

and now remember the character which we attributed to the democrati

ant in his drone-like nature, then at last this
lord of the soul, having madness for the captain of his guard, breaks
out into a frenzy: and if he finds in himself any good opinions or
appetites in process of formation, and there is in him any sense of
shame remaining, to these better principles he puts an end, and casts
them forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in madness to
the full.

yes, he said, that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated.

and is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?

i should not wonder.

further, i said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant?

he has.

and you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind, will
fancy that he is able to rule, not only over men, but also over the
gods?

that he will.

and the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being
when, either under the influence of nature, or habit, or both, he
becomes drunken, lustful, passionate? o my friend, is not

a dream only; he will commit the foulest murder, or eat forbidden food,
or be guilty of any other horrid act. love is his tyrant, and lives
lordly in him and lawlessly, and being himself a king, leads him on, as
a tyrant leads a state, to the performance of any reckless deed by which
he can maintain himself and the rabble of his associates, whether those
whom evil communications have brought in from without, or those whom
he himself has allowed to break loose within him by reason of a similar
evil nature in himself. have we not here a picture of his way of life?

yes, indeed, he said.

and if there are only a few of them in the state, and the rest of the
people are well disposed, they go away and become the body-guard or
mercenary soldiers of some other tyrant who may probably want them for a
war; and if there is no war, they stay at home and do many little pieces
of mischief in the city.

what sort of mischief?

for example, they are the thieves, burglars, cut-purses,

he said.

let me then offer you an illustration, which may, i think, throw a light
upon this subject.

what is your illustration?

the case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves: from
them you may form an idea of the tyrant's condition, for they both have
slaves; the only difference is that he has more slaves.

yes, that is the difference.

you know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from
their servants?

what should they fear?

nothing. but do you observe the reason of this?

yes; the reason is, that the whole city is leagued together for the
protection of each individual.

very true, i said. but imagine one of these owners, the master say of
some fifty slaves, together with his family and property and slaves,
carried off by a god into the wilderness, where there are no freemen to
help him--will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and
children should be put to death by his slaves?

yes, he said, he will be in the utmost fear.

the time has a

under the idea that if there were no necessity for them, he would rather
not have them?

there can be no doubt of that, he replied.

since, then, the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in
dispute, and the question is not which life is more or less honourable,
or better or worse, but which is the more pleasant or painless--how
shall we know who speaks truly?

i cannot myself tell, he said.

well, but what ought to be the criterion? is any better than experience
and wisdom and reason?

there cannot be a better, he said.

then, i said, reflect. of the three individuals, which has the greatest
experience of all the pleasures which we enumerated? has the lover of
gain, in learning the nature of essential truth, greater experience of
the pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of
gain?

the philosopher, he replied, has greatly the advantage; for he has
of necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his
childhood upwards: but the lover of

nd as they all receive honour they all have
experience of the pleasures of honour; but the delight which is to be
found in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher only.

his experience, then, will enable him to judge better than any one?

far better.

and he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience?

certainly.

further, the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not
possessed by the covetous or ambitious man, but only by the philosopher?

what faculty?

reason, with whom, as we were saying, the decision ought to rest.

yes.

and reasoning is peculiarly his instrument?

certainly.

if wealth and gain were the criterion, then the praise or blame of the
lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy?

assuredly.

or if honour or victory or courage, in that case the judgment of the
ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest?

clearly.

but since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges--

the only inference possible, he replied, is that pleas

ures which are
approved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest.

and so we arrive at the result, that the pleasure of the intelligent
part of the soul is the pleasantest of the three, and that he of us in
whom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life.

unquestionably, he said, the wise man speaks with authority when he
approves of his own life.

and what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the
pleasure which is next?

clearly that of the soldier and lover of honour; who is nearer to

into the true upper world; thither they neither look, nor do they ever
find their way, neither are they truly filled with true being, nor do
they taste of pure and abiding pleasure. like cattle, with their eyes
always looking down and their heads stooping to the earth, that is,
to the dining-table, they fatten and feed and breed, and, in their
excessive love of these delights, they kick and butt at one another with
horns and hoofs which are made of iron; and they kill one another by
reason of their insatiable lust. for they fill themselves with that
which is not substantial, and the part of themselves which they fill is
also unsubstantial and incontinent.

verily, socrates, said glaucon, you describe the life of the many like
an oracle.

their pleasures are mixed with pains--how can they be otherwise? for
they are mere shadows and pictures of the true, and are coloured by
contrast, which exaggerates both light and shade, and so they implant
in the minds of fools insane desires of

something of that sort must inevitably happen.

and must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element
of the soul? will not the passionate man who carries his passion into
action, be in the like case, whether he is envious and ambitious, or
violent and contentious, or angry and discontented, if he be seeking
to attain honour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without
reason or sense?

yes, he said, the same will happen with the spirited element also.

then may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour,
when they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company
of reason and knowledge, and pursue after and win the pleasures which
wisdom shows them, will also have the truest pleasures in the highest
degree which is attainable to them, inasmuch as they follow truth; and
they will have the pleasures which are natural to them, if that whic

exactly.

but when either of the two other principles prevails, it fails in
attaining its own pleasure, and compels the rest to pursue after a
pleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own?

true.

and the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and
reason, the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?

yes.

and is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance
from law and order?

clearly.

and the lustful and tyrannical desires are, as we saw, at the greatest
distance? yes.

and the royal and orderly desires are nearest?

yes.

then the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural
pleasure, and the king at the least?

certainly.

but if so, the tyrant will live most unpleasantly, and the king most

antly?

inevitably.

would you know the measure of the interval which separates them?

will you tell me?

there appear to be three pleasures, one genuine and two spurious: now
the transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious; he
has run away from the region of law and reason, and taken up his abode
with certain slave pleasures which are his satellites, and the measure
of his inferiority can only be expressed in a figure.

how do you mean?

i assume, i said, that the tyrant is in the third place from the
oligarch; the democrat was in the middle?

yes.

and if there is truth in what has preceded, he will be wedded to an
image of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure
of the oligarch?

he will.

and the oligarch is third from the royal; since w

of them all should be uniting the several parts with one another and

yes, he said, that is quite what the maintainer of justice say.

and so from every point of view, whether of pleasure, honour, or
advantage, the approver of justice is right and speaks the truth, and
the disapprover is wrong and false and ignorant?

yes, from every point of view.

come, now, and let us gently reason with the unjust, who is not
intentionally in error. 'sweet sir,' we will say to him, 'what think
you of things esteemed noble and ignoble? is not the noble that which
subjects the beast to the man, or rather to the god in man; and the
ignoble that which subjects the man to the beast?' he can hardly avoid
saying yes--can he now?

not if he has any regard for my opinion.

but, if he agree so far, we may ask him to answer another question:
'then how would a man profit if he received gold and silve

true, he said.

and why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach? only because
they imply a natural weakness of the higher principle; the individual is
unable to control the creatures within him, but has to court them, and
his great study is how to flatter them.

such appears to be the reason.

and therefore, being desirous of placing him under a rule like that of
the best, we say that he ought to be the servant of the best, in whom
the divine rules; not, as thrasymachus supposed, to the injury of the
servant, but because every one had better be ruled by divine wisdom
dwelling within him; or, if this be impossible, then by an external
authority, in order that we may be all, as far as possible, under the
same government, friends and equals.

true, he said.

he will look at the city which is within him, and take heed that no
disorder occur in it, such as might arise either from superfluity or
from want; and upon this principle he will regulate his property and
gain or spend according to his means.

very true.

and, for the same reason, he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours
as he deems likely to make him a better man; but those, whether private
or public, which are likely to disorder his life, he will avoid?

then, if that is his motive, he will not be a statesman.

will, though in the land of his birth perhaps not, unless he have a

this was the conclusion at which i was seeking to arrive when i said
that painting or drawing, and imitation in general, when doing their own
proper work, are far removed from truth, and the companions and friends
and associates of a principle within us which is equally removed from
reason, and that they have no true or healthy aim.

exactly.

the imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior, and has
inferior offspring.

very true.

and is this confined to the sight only, or does it extend to the hearing
also, relating in fact to what we term poetry?

probably the same would be true of poetry.

do not rely, i said, on a probability derived from the analogy of
painting; but let us examine further and see whether the faculty with
which poetical imitation is concerned is goo

 sorrow, or shall we say that although he cannot help
sorrowing, he will moderate his sorrow?

the latter, he said, is the truer statement.

tell me: will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his
sorrow when he is seen by his equals, or when he is alone?

it will make a great difference whether he is seen or not.

when he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things which
he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do?

true.

there is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist, as
well as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge his
sorrow?

true.

but when a man is drawn in two opposite directions, to and from the same
object, this, as we affirm, necessarily implies two distinct principles
in him?

certainly.

one of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law?

how do you mean?

the law would say that to be patient under suffering is best, and that
we should not give way to impatience, as there is no knowing wheth

such things are good or evil; and nothing is gained by impatience; also,
because no human thing is of serious importance, and grief stands in the
way of that which at the moment is most required.

what is most required? he asked.

that we should take counsel about what has happened, and when the dice
have been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems best;
not, like children who have had a fall, keeping hold of the part struck
and wasting time in setting up a howl, but always accustoming the soul
forthwith to apply a remedy, raising up that which is sickly and fallen,
banishing the cry of sorrow by the healing art.

yes, he said, that is the true way of meeting the attacks of fortune.

yes, i said; and the higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion
of reason?

clearly.

and the other principle, which inclines us to recollecti

clearly.

and now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the painter,
for he is like him in two ways: first, inasmuch as his creations have an
inferior degree of truth--in this, i say, he is like him; and he is
also like him in being concerned with an inferior part of the soul; and
therefore we shall be right in refusing to admit him into a well-ordered
state, because he awakens and nourishes and strengthens the feelings
and impairs the reason. as in a city when the evil are permitted to have
authority and the good are put out of the way, so in the soul of man,
as we maintain, the imitative poet implants an evil constitution, for he
indulges the irrational nature which has no discernment of greater
and less, but thinks the same thing at one time great and at another
small--he is a manufacturer of images and is very far removed from the
truth.

exactly.

but we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our
accusation:--the po

ost.

yes, of course i know.

but when any sorrow of our own happens to us, then you may observe that
we pride ourselves on the opposite quality--we would fain be quiet and
patient; this is the manly part, and the other which delighted us in the
recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman.

very true, he said.

now can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing that
which any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own person?

no, he said, that is certainly not reasonable.

nay, i said, quite reasonable from one point of view.

what point of view?

if you consider, i said, that when in misfortune we feel a natural
hunger and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation, and
that this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities is
satisfied and delighted by the poets;--the better nature in each of
us, not having been sufficiently trained by reason or habit, allows the
sympathetic element to break loose because the sorrow is another's;

how very true!

and does not the same hold also of the ridiculous? there are jests which
you would be ashamed to make yourself, and yet on the comic stage, or
indeed in private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused by them,
and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness;--the case of pity
is repeated;--there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to
raise a laugh, and this which you once restrained by reason, because you
were afraid of being thought a buffoon, is now let out again; and
having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre, you are betrayed
unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet at home.

quite true, he said.

and the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections,
of desire and pain and pleasure, which are held to be inseparable
from every action--in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions
instead of drying them up; she lets them rule, althou

whole life according to him, we may love and honour those
who say these things--they are excellent people, as far as their lights
extend; and we are ready to acknowledge that homer is the greatest
of poets and first of tragedy writers; but we must remain firm in our
conviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the only
poetry which ought to be admitted into our state. for if you go beyond
this and allow the honeyed muse to enter, either in epic or lyric verse,
not law and the reason of mankind, which by common consent have ever
been deemed best, but pleasure and pain will be the rulers in our state.

that is most true, he said.

and now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry, let this our
defence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in
sending away out of our state an art having the tendencies which we have
described; for reason constrained us. but that she may not impute to us
any harshness or want of politeness, let us tell her that there is a

things of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation through
their own corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so
destroying them. is not this true?

yes.

consider the soul in like manner. does the injustice or other evil which
exists in the soul waste and consume her? do they by attaching to the
soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate her
from the body?

certainly not.

and yet, i said, it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish
from without through affection of external evil which could not be
destroyed from within by a corruption of its own?

it is, he replied.

consider, i said, glaucon, that even the badness of food, whether
staleness, decomposition, or any other bad quality, when confined to
the actual food, is not supposed to destroy the body; although, if the
badness of food communicates corruption to the body, then we should say
that the body has been destroyed by a corru

ption of itself, which is
disease, brought on by this; but that the body, being one thing, can be
destroyed by the badness of food, which is another, and which does not
engender any natural infection--this we shall absolutely deny?

very true.

and, on the same principle, unless some bodily evil can produce an evil
of the soul, we must not suppose that the soul, which is one thing, can
be dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to another?

yes, he said, there is reason in that.

either, then, let us refute this conclusion, or, while it remains
unrefuted, let us never say that fever, or any other disease, or the
knife put to the throat, or even the cutting up of the whole body into
the minutest pieces, can destroy the soul, until she herself is proved
to become more unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things
being done to the body; but that the soul, or anything else if not
destroyed by an internal evil, can be destroyed by an external one, is
not to

e soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil, whether inherent
or external, must exist for ever, and if existing for ever, must be
immortal?

certainly.

that is the conclusion, i said; and, if a true conclusion, then the
souls must always be the same, for if none be destroyed they will not
diminish in number. neither will they increase, for the increase of the
immortal natures must come from something mortal, and all things would
thus end in immortality.

very true.

but this we cannot believe--reason will not allow us--any more than we
can believe the soul, in her truest nature, to be full of variety and
difference and dissimilarity.

what do you mean? he said.

the soul, i said, being, as is now proven, immortal, must be the fairest
of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements?

certainly not.

her immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument, and there are
many other proofs; but to see her as she really is, not as we now behold
her, marred by communion with the body a

then her beauty will be revealed, and justice and injustice and all the
things which we have described will be manifested more clearly. thus
far, we have spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at present,
but we must remember also that we have seen her only in a condition
which may be compared to that of the sea-god glaucus, whose original

also the soul of thamyras choosing the life of a nightingale; birds, on
the other hand, like the swan and other musicians, wanting to be men.
the soul which obtained the twentieth lot chose the life of a lion, and
this was the soul of ajax the son of telamon, who would not be a man,
remembering the injustice which was done him in the judgment about the
arms. the next was agamemnon, who took the life of an eagle, because,
like ajax, he hated human nature by reason of his sufferings. about
the middle came the lot of atalanta; she, seeing the great fame of
an athlete, was unable to resist the temptation: and after her there
followed the soul of epeus the son of panopeus passing into the nature
of a woman cunning in the arts; and far away among the last who chose,
the soul of the jester thersites was putting on the form of a monkey.
there came also the soul of odysseus having yet to make a choice, and
his lot happened to be the last of them all. now the rec
