Clifford - 
      Clifford's father was killed by York at the end of 2 Henry VI, so Clifford begins this play with blood lust. He kills York's young son Rutland, then York himself. He and Richard become enemies, and Richard tries to kill him on the battlefield, but Clifford dies from an arrow wound before Richard can find him.
