 kind of wrestling before. as soon as the
two boys closed in, one of them did something which no one could
describe because it had been as quick as a flash. and the other boy
was flat on his back. the crowd roared and clapped and for a while
drowned the frenzied drums. okonkwo sprang to his feet and
quickly sat down again. three young men from the victorious
boy's team ran forward, carried him shoulder high and danced
through the cheering crowd. everybody soon knew who the boy
was. his name was maduka, the son of obierika.

the drummers stopped for a brief rest before the real matches.
their bodies shone with sweat, and they took up fans and began to
fan themselves. they also drank water from small pots and ate kola
nuts. they became ordinary human beings again, talking and
laughing among themselves and with others who stood near them.
the air, which had been stretched taut with excitement, relaxed
again. it was as if water had been poured on the tightened skin of a
drum. many people looked

sitting outside under the shade of an orange tree
making thatches from leaves of the raffia-palm. he exchanged
greetings with okonkwo and led the way into his obi.

"i was coming over to see you as soon as i finished that thatch," he
said, rubbing off the grains of sand that clung to his thighs.

"is it well?" okonkwo asked.

"yes," replied obierika. "my daughter's suitor is coming today and
i hope we will clinch the matter of the bride-price. i want you to be
there."

just then obierika's son, maduka, came into the obi from outside,
greeted okonkwo and turned towards the compound,



"come and shake hands with me," okonkwo said to the lad. "your
wrestling the other day gave me much happiness." the boy smiled,
shook hands with okonkwo and went into the compound.



"he will do great things," okonkwo said. "if i had a son like him i
should be happy. i am worried about nwoye. a bowl of pounded
yams can throw him in a wrestling match. his two younger
brothers are more promising. but i can tell

thread of title on his ankle, and does not lose it even if he steals."

"they have indeed soiled the name of ozo," said okonkwo as he
rose to go.

"it will not be very long now before my in-laws come," said
obierika.

"i shall return very soon," said okonkwo, looking at the position of
the sun.

there were seven men in obierika's hut when okonkwo returned.
the suitor was a young man of about twenty-five, and with him
were his father and uncle. on obierika's side were his two elder
brothers and maduka, his sixteen-year-old son.

"ask akueke's mother to send us some kola nuts," said obierika to
his son. maduka vanished into the compound like lightning. the
conversation at once centered on him, and everybody agreed that
he was as sharp as a razor.

"i sometimes think he is too sharp," said obierika, somewhat
indulgently. "he hardly ever walks. he is always in a hurry. if you
are sending him on an errand he flies away before he has heard
half of the message."

"you were very much like that your

self," said his eldest brother.
"as our people say, 'when mother-cow is chewing grass its young
ones watch its mouth.' maduka has been watching your mouth."

as he was speaking the boy returned, followed by akueke, his
half-sister, carrying a wooden dish with three kola nuts and
alligator pepper. she gave the dish to her father's eldest brother and
then shook hands, very shyly, with her suitor and his relatives. she



was about sixteen and just ripe for marriage. her suitor and his
relatives surveyed her young body with expert eyes as if to assure
themselves that she was beautiful and ripe.



she wore a coiffure wh

"we had not thought to go below thirty. but as the dog said, 'if i
fall down for you and you fall down for me, it is play'. marriage
should be a play and not a fight so we are falling down again." he
then added ten sticks to the fifteen and gave the bundle to ukegbu.



in this way akuke's bride-price was finally settled at twenty bags
of cowries. it was already dusk when the two parties came to this
agreement.



"go and tell akueke's mother that we have finished," obierika said
to his son, maduka. almost immediately the women came in with
a big bowl of foo-foo. obierika's second wife followed with a pot
of soup, and maduka brought in a pot of palm-wine.

as the men ate and drank palm-wine they talked about the customs
of their neighbors.

"it was only this morning," said obierika, "that okonkwo and i
were talking about abame and aninta, where titled men climb
trees and pound foo-foo for their wives."

"all their customs are upside-down. they do not decide bride-
price as we do, with sti

d's," said ezelagbo. "one of the young children
had opened the gate of the cow-shed."



early in the afternoon the first two pots of palm-wine arrived from
obierika's in-laws. they were duly presented to the women, who
drank a cup or two each, to help them in their cooking. some of it
also went to the bride and her attendant maidens, who were putting
the last delicate touches of razor to her coiffure and cam wood on
her smooth skin.



when the heat of the sun began to soften, obierika's son, maduka,
took a long broom and swept the ground in front of his father's obi.
and as if they had been waiting for that, obierika's relatives and
friends began to arrive, every man with his goatskin bag hung on
one shoulder and a rolled goatskin mat under his arm. some of
them were accompanied by their sons bearing carved wooden
stools. okonkwo was one of them. they sat in a half-circle and
began to talk of many things. it would not be long before the
suitors came.

okonkwo brought out his snuff-bottle

ezenwa took it, tapped it on his
kneecap, rubbed his left palm on his body to dry it before tipping a
little snuff into it. his actions were deliberate, and he spoke as he
performed them:

"1 hope our in-laws will bring many pots of wine. although they
come from a village that is known for being closefisted, they ought
to know that akueke is the bride for a king."

"they dare not bring fewer than thirty pots," said okonkwo. "i
shall tell them my mind if they do."

at that moment obierika's son, maduka, led out the giant goat
from the inner compound, for his father's relatives to see. they all
admired it and said that that was the way things should be done.
the goat was then led back to the inner compound.





very soon after, the in-laws began to arrive. young men and boys
in single file, each carrying a pot of wine, came first. obierika's
relatives counted the pots as they came. twenty, twenty-five.
there was a long break, and the hosts looked at each other as if to
say, "1 told you." the
