raight in the face.
â€œiâ€™ve brought something to pawn here,â€ and he drew out of his pocket an old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a globe; the chain was of steel.
â€œbut the time is up for your last pledge. the month was up the day before yesterday.â€
â€œi will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little.â€
â€œbut thatâ€™s for me to do as i please, my good sir, to wait or to sell your pledge at once.â€
â€œhow much will you give me for the watch, alyona ivanovna?â€
â€œyou come with such trifles, my good sir, itâ€™s scarcely worth anything. i gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it quite new at a jewelerâ€™s for a rouble and a half.â€
â€œgive me four roubles for it, i shall redeem it, it was my fatherâ€™s. i shall be getting some money soon.â€
â€œa rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!â€
â€œa rouble and a half!â€ cried the young man.
â€œplease yourselfâ€â€”and the old woman handed him back the watch. th

ecks on the same reckoning in advance. that makes thirty-five copecks altogether. so i must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the watch. here it is.â€
â€œwhat! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!â€
â€œjust so.â€
the young man did not dispute it and took the money. he looked at the old woman, and was in no hurry to get away, as though there was still something he wanted to say or to do, but he did not himself quite know what.
â€œi may be bringing you something else in a day or two, alyona ivanovnaâ€”a valuable thingâ€”silverâ€”a cigarette-box, as soon as i get it back from a friend...â€ he broke off in confusion.
â€œwell, we will talk about it then, sir.â€
â€œgood-byeâ€”are you always at home alone, your sister is not here with you?â€ he asked her as casually as possible as he went out into the passage.
â€œwhat business is she of yours, my good sir?â€
â€œoh, nothing particular, i simply asked. you are too quick.... good-day, alyona ivanovna.â€
raskolnikov went out in complete confus

ed aimlessly in the streets. here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention, and one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people. at the corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out with tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, etc. they, too, had got up to go home, but were lingering in conversation with a friend, who had just come up to them. this friend was lizaveta ivanovna, or, as everyone called her, lizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, alyona ivanovna, whom raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his watch and make his experiment.... he already knew all about lizaveta and she knew him a little too. she was a single woman of about thirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, submissive and almost idiotic. she was a complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister, who made her work day and night, and even beat her. she was standing with a bundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly and doubtfully. they were talking o

ng with special warmth. the moment raskolnikov caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strange sensation as it were of intense astonishment, though there was nothing astonishing about this meeting.
â€œyou could make up your mind for yourself, lizaveta ivanovna,â€ the huckster was saying aloud. â€œcome round to-morrow about seven. they will be here too.â€
â€œto-morrow?â€ said lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully, as though unable to make up her mind.
â€œupon my word, what a fright you are in of alyona ivanovna,â€ gabbled the hucksterâ€™s wife, a lively little woman. â€œi look at you, you are like some little babe. and she is not your own sister eitherâ€”nothing but a step-sister and what a hand she keeps over you!â€
â€œbut this time donâ€™t say a word to alyona ivanovna,â€ her husband interrupted; â€œthatâ€™s my advice, but come round to us without asking. it will be worth your while. later on your sister herself may have a notion.â€
â€œam i to come?â€
â€œabout seven oâ€™clock to-morrow. and the

 and, as we have said already, she was very submissive and timid.
but raskolnikov had become superstitious of late. the traces of superstition remained in him long after, and were almost ineradicable. and in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see something strange and mysterious, as it were, the presence of some peculiar influences and coincidences. in the previous winter a student he knew called pokorev, who had left for harkov, had chanced in conversation to give him the address of alyona ivanovna, the old pawnbroker, in case he might want to pawn anything. for a long while he did not go to her, for he had lessons and managed to get along somehow. six weeks ago he had remembered the address; he had two articles that could be pawned: his fatherâ€™s old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones, a present from his sister at parting. he decided to take the ring. when he found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her at the first glance, though he knew no

wo roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way home. he asked for tea, sat down and sank into deep thought. a strange idea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg, and very, very much absorbed him.
almost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student, whom he did not know and had never seen, and with him a young officer. they had played a game of billiards and began drinking tea. all at once he heard the student mention to the officer the pawnbroker alyona ivanovna and give him her address. this of itself seemed strange to raskolnikov; he had just come from her and here at once he heard her name. of course it was a chance, but he could not shake off a very extraordinary impression, and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him; the student began telling his friend various details about alyona ivanovna.
â€œshe is first-rate,â€ he said. â€œyou can always get money from her. she is as rich as a jew, she can give you five thousand roubles at a tim

 disarm her suspicions, he took hold of the door and drew it towards him to prevent the old woman from attempting to shut it again. seeing this she did not pull the door back, but she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged her out with it on to the stairs. seeing that she was standing in the doorway not allowing him to pass, he advanced straight upon her. she stepped back in alarm, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak and stared with open eyes at him.
â€œgood evening, alyona ivanovna,â€ he began, trying to speak easily, but his voice would not obey him, it broke and shook. â€œi have come... i have brought something... but weâ€™d better come in... to the light....â€
and leaving her, he passed straight into the room uninvited. the old woman ran after him; her tongue was unloosed.
â€œgood heavens! what it is? who is it? what do you want?â€
â€œwhy, alyona ivanovna, you know me... raskolnikov... here, i brought you the pledge i promised the other day...â€ and he held out the

or at the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected every minute that the fastening would be pulled out. it certainly did seem possible, so violently was he shaking it. he was tempted to hold the fastening, but he might be aware of it. a giddiness came over him again. â€œi shall fall down!â€ flashed through his mind, but the unknown began to speak and he recovered himself at once.
â€œwhatâ€™s up? are they asleep or murdered? d-damn them!â€ he bawled in a thick voice, â€œhey, alyona ivanovna, old witch! lizaveta ivanovna, hey, my beauty! open the door! oh, damn them! are they asleep or what?â€
and again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a dozen times at the bell. he must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate acquaintance.
at this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, on the stairs. someone else was approaching. raskolnikov had not heard them at first.
â€œyou donâ€™t say thereâ€™s no one at home,â€ the new-comer cried in a cheerful, ringing voice, addre

â€™s story. â€˜iâ€™ve known this peasant, nikolay dementyev, from a child; he comes from the same province and district of zaraÃ¯sk, we are both ryazan men. and though nikolay is not a drunkard, he drinks, and i knew he had a job in that house, painting work with dmitri, who comes from the same village, too. as soon as he got the rouble he changed it, had a couple of glasses, took his change and went out. but i did not see dmitri with him then. and the next day i heard that someone had murdered alyona ivanovna and her sister, lizaveta ivanovna, with an axe. i knew them, and i felt suspicious about the ear-rings at once, for i knew the murdered woman lent money on pledges. i went to the house, and began to make careful inquiries without saying a word to anyone. first of all i asked, â€œis nikolay here?â€ dmitri told me that nikolay had gone off on the spree; he had come home at daybreak drunk, stayed in the house about ten minutes, and went out again. dmitri didnâ€™t see him again and is finishing th

is!â€ raskolnikov thought with repulsion.
â€œallow me to observe,â€ he answered dryly, â€œthat i donâ€™t consider myself a mahomet or a napoleon, nor any personage of that kind, and not being one of them i cannot tell you how i should act.â€
â€œoh, come, donâ€™t we all think ourselves napoleons now in russia?â€ porfiry petrovitch said with alarming familiarity.
something peculiar betrayed itself in the very intonation of his voice.
â€œperhaps it was one of these future napoleons who did for alyona ivanovna last week?â€ zametov blurted out from the corner.
raskolnikov did not speak, but looked firmly and intently at porfiry. razumihin was scowling gloomily. he seemed before this to be noticing something. he looked angrily around. there was a minute of gloomy silence. raskolnikov turned to go.
â€œare you going already?â€ porfiry said amiably, holding out his hand with excessive politeness. â€œvery, very glad of your acquaintance. as for your request, have no uneasiness, write just as i told you,

€œpainters? no, i didnâ€™t see them,â€ raskolnikov answered slowly, as though ransacking his memory, while at the same instant he was racking every nerve, almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture as quickly as possible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything. â€œno, i didnâ€™t see them, and i donâ€™t think i noticed a flat like that open.... but on the fourth storeyâ€ (he had mastered the trap now and was triumphant) â€œi remember now that someone was moving out of the flat opposite alyona ivanovnaâ€™s.... i remember... i remember it clearly. some porters were carrying out a sofa and they squeezed me against the wall. but painters... no, i donâ€™t remember that there were any painters, and i donâ€™t think that there was a flat open anywhere, no, there wasnâ€™t.â€
â€œwhat do you mean?â€ razumihin shouted suddenly, as though he had reflected and realised. â€œwhy, it was on the day of the murder the painters were at work, and he was there three days before? what are you asking?â€
â€œfoo!

enly, rather breathless, but speaking fairly loudly.
for ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb; even the warder stepped back, mechanically retreated to the door, and stood immovable.
â€œwhat is it?â€ cried porfiry petrovitch, recovering from his momentary stupefaction.
â€œi... am the murderer,â€ repeated nikolay, after a brief pause.
â€œwhat... you... what... whom did you kill?â€ porfiry petrovitch was obviously bewildered.
nikolay again was silent for a moment.
â€œalyona ivanovna and her sister lizaveta ivanovna, i... killed... with an axe. darkness came over me,â€ he added suddenly, and was again silent.
he still remained on his knees. porfiry petrovitch stood for some moments as though meditating, but suddenly roused himself and waved back the uninvited spectators. they instantly vanished and closed the door. then he looked towards raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner, staring wildly at nikolay and moved towards him, but stopped short, looked from nikolay to r
