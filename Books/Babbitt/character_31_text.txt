e laughing at him.

he betrayed his depression by the violence with which he informed his
wife, "folks that really tend to business haven't got the time to waste
on a bunch like the mckelveys. this society stuff is like any other
hobby; if you devote yourself to it, you get on. but i like to have a
chance to visit with you and the children instead of all this idiotic
chasing round."

they did not speak of the mckelveys again.

it was a shame, at this worried time, to have to think about the
overbrooks.

ed overbrook was a classmate of babbitt who had been a failure. he had
a large family and a feeble insurance business out in the suburb of
dorchester. he was gray and thin and unimportant. he had always been
gray and thin and unimportant. he was the person whom, in any group,
you forgot to introduce, then introduced with extra enthusiasm. he had
admired babbitt's good-fellowship in college, had admired ever since
his power in real estate, his beautiful house and wonderful clothes. it
pleased

hooptedoodle."

he accepted overbrook's next plaintive invitation, for an evening two
weeks off. a dinner two weeks off, even a family dinner, never seems
so appalling, till the two weeks have astoundingly disappeared and
one comes dismayed to the ambushed hour. they had to change the date,
because of their own dinner to the mckelveys, but at last they gloomily
drove out to the overbrooks' house in dorchester.

it was miserable from the beginning. the overbrooks had dinner at
six-thirty, while the babbitts never dined before seven. babbitt
permitted himself to be ten minutes late. "let's make it as short as
possible. i think we'll duck out quick. i'll say i have to be at the
office extra early to-morrow," he planned.

the overbrook house was depressing. it was the second story of a wooden
two-family dwelling; a place of baby-carriages, old hats hung in
the hall, cabbage-smell, a

not that but--oh, georgie, you don't suppose we
have to invite them to dinner at our house now, do we?"

"ouch! gaw, i hope not!"

"see here, now, george! you didn't say anything about it to mr.
overbrook, did you?"

"no! gee! no! honest, i didn't! just made a bluff about having him to
lunch some time."

"well.... oh, dear.... i don't want to hurt their feelings. but i
don't see how i could stand another evening like this one. and suppose
somebody like dr. and mrs. angus came in when we had the overbrooks
there, and thought they were friends of ours!"

for a week they worried, "we really ought to invite ed and his wife,
poor devils!" but as they never saw the overbrooks, they forgot them,
and after a month or two they said, "that really was the best way, just
to let it slide. it wouldn't be kind to them to have them here. they'd
feel so out of place and hard-up in our home."

they did not speak of the overbrooks again.
