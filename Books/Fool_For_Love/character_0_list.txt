Eddie - 
      The play's protagonist. Dressed in cowboy gear from head to toe, Eddie is a larger than life, multi-dimensional character. Some of his traits are not larger than life but ordinary weaknesses. For instance, he is an overly proud man with a drinking problem. Eddie is emblematic of the symbol he believes in. He believes in the myths of the idyllic American West, the cowboy as a hero who saves the day, and the American Dream of country living. Eddie habitually entangles himself in volatile romances. His passionate, competitive nature magnifies itself when he drinks and when he relates to his lovers May and "the Countess." He has trouble distinguishing between reality and fiction, lies and truth though he would not admit this. Eddie has a strange but complicit relationship with his father, the Old Man character in the play who exists only in May and Eddie's minds. Eddie shares his love of liquor with the Old Man and seems to share the same sense of humor. Eddie's character contains autobiographical elements of Sam Shepard's life. He wrote Fool for Love after leaving his wife, O-Lan, for movie actress, Jessica Lange and has a complicated past with his heavy-drinking father.
