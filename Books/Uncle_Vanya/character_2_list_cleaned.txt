[CHARACTER] ([CHARACTER])  - 
      the professor's beautiful wife, yelena (the russian equivalent of the greek "helen") fascinates all the major characters of the play, causing them to abandon their duties and fall into idleness. indeed, she is characterized throughout the play by her infectious idleness and lack of interest in any serious work. raised in the st. petersburg conservatory, she sacrificed a budding music career to marry the aging serebryakov, whom she does not love but remains bound to him by conscience, convention, and inertia. like a number of the play's characters, she suffers from a certain sense of self-estrangement, understanding herself as an "incidental character" in her own life.
