hither, catesby.
    thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
    as closely to conceal what we impart.
    thou know'st our reasons urg'd upon the way.
    what think'st thou? is it not an easy matter
    to make william lord hastings of our mind,
    for the instalment of this noble duke
    in the seat royal of this famous isle?
  catesby. he for his father's sake so loves the prince
    that he will not be won to aught against him.
  buckingham. what think'st thou then of stanley? will
    not he?
  catesby. he will do all in all as hastings doth.
  buckingham. well then, no more but this: go, gentle
    catesby,
    and, as it were far off, sound thou lord hastings
    how he doth stand affected to our purpose;
    and summon him to-morrow to the tower,
    to sit about the coronation.
    if thou dost find him tractable to us,
    encourage him, and tell him all our reasons;
    if he be leaden, icy, cold, unwilling,
    be thou so too, and so break off th
