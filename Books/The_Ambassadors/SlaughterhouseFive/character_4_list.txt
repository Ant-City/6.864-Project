Gerhard Muller - 
                 The
nonfictional taxi driver who takes Vonnegut and O'Hare back to their
Dresden slaughterhouse. Muller later sends O'Hare a Christmas card
bearing tidings of peace, and Vonnegut dedicates the novel in part
to Muller--two simple gestures of sympathy that stand out amid the
novel's pervasive cruelty and violence.
