Dogberry - 
                The
constable in charge of the Watch, or chief policeman, of Messina.
Dogberry is very sincere and takes his job seriously, but he has
a habit of using exactly the wrong word to convey his meaning. Dogberry
is one of the few "middling sort," or middle-class characters, in
the play, though his desire to speak formally and elaborately like
the noblemen becomes an occasion for parody.
