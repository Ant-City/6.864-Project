that passes understanding.

buck heard the chaffering, saw the money pass between the man and the
government agent, and knew that the scotch half-breed and the mail-train
drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of perrault and
francois and the others who had gone before. when driven with his mates
to the new owners’ camp, buck saw a slipshod and slovenly affair, tent
half stretched, dishes unwashed, everything in disorder; also, he saw a
woman. “mercedes” the men called her. she was charles’s wife and hal’s
sister--a nice family party.

buck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the tent
and load the sled. there was a great deal of effort about their manner,
but no businesslike method. the tent was rolled into an awkward bundle
three times as large as it should have been. the tin dishes were packed
away unwashed. mercedes continually fluttered in the way of her men and
kept up an unbroken chattering of remonstrance an

nd when they had put it on the back, and covered it over
with a couple of other bundles, she discovered overlooked articles which
could abide nowhere else but in that very sack, and they unloaded again.

three men from a neighboring tent came out and looked on, grinning and
winking at one another.

“you’ve got a right smart load as it is,” said one of them; “and it’s
not me should tell you your business, but i wouldn’t tote that tent
along if i was you.”

“undreamed of!” cried mercedes, throwing up her hands in dainty dismay.
“however in the world could i manage without a tent?”

“it’s springtime, and you won’t get any more cold weather,” the man
replied.

she shook her head decidedly, and charles and hal put the last odds and
ends on top the mountainous load.

“think it’ll ride?” one of the men asked.

“why shouldn’t it?” charles demanded rather shortly.

“oh, that’s all right, that’s all right,” the man hastened meekly to
say. “i was just a

gs can hike along all day with that contraption
behind them,” affirmed a second of the men.

“certainly,” said hal, with freezing politeness, taking hold of the
gee-pole with one hand and swinging his whip from the other. “mush!” he
shouted. “mush on there!”

the dogs sprang against the breast-bands, strained hard for a few
moments, then relaxed. they were unable to move the sled.

“the lazy brutes, i’ll show them,” he cried, preparing to lash out at
them with the whip.

but mercedes interfered, crying, “oh, hal, you mustn’t,” as she caught
hold of the whip and wrenched it from him. “the poor dears! now you
must promise you won’t be harsh with them for the rest of the trip, or i
won’t go a step.”

“precious lot you know about dogs,” her brother sneered; “and i wish
you’d leave me alone. they’re lazy, i tell you, and you’ve got to whip
them to get anything out of them. that’s their way. you ask any one. ask
one of those men.”

mercedes looked at

 them imploringly, untold repugnance at sight of pain
written in her pretty face.

“they’re weak as water, if you want to know,” came the reply from one
of the men. “plum tuckered out, that’s what’s the matter. they need a
rest.”

“rest be blanked,” said hal, with his beardless lips; and mercedes said,
“oh!” in pain and sorrow at the oath.

but she was a clannish creature, and rushed at once to the defence of
her brother. “never mind that man,” she said pointedly. “you’re driving
our dogs, and you do what you think best with them.”

again hal’s whip fell upon the dogs. they threw themselves against the
breast-bands, dug their feet into the packed snow, got down low to it,
and put forth all their strength. the sled held as though it were an
anchor. after two efforts, they

 stood still, panting. the whip was
whistling savagely, when once more mercedes interfered. she dropped on
her knees before buck, with tears in her eyes, and put her arms around
his neck.

“you poor, poor dears,” she cried sympathetically, “why don’t you pull
hard?--then you wouldn’t be whipped.” buck did not like her, but he
was feeling too miserable to resist her, taking it as part of the day’s
miserable work.

one of the onlookers, who had been clenching his teeth to suppress hot
speech, now spoke up:--

“it’s not that i care a whoop what becomes of yo

 listened unwillingly, pitched tent, and
overhauled the outfit. canned goods were turned out that made men laugh,
for canned goods on the long trail is a thing to dream about. “blankets
for a hotel” quoth one of the men who laughed and helped. “half as
many is too much; get rid of them. throw away that tent, and all those
dishes,--who’s going to wash them, anyway? good lord, do you think
you’re travelling on a pullman?”

and so it went, the inexorable elimination of the superfluous. mercedes
cried when her clothes-bags were dumped on the ground and article
after article was thrown out. she cried in general, and she cried in
particular over each discarded thing. she clasped hands about knees,
rocking back and forth broken-heartedly. she averred she would not go
an inch, not for a dozen charleses. she appealed to everybody and to
everything, finally wiping her eyes and proceeding to cast out even
articles of apparel that were imperative necessaries. and in her zeal,
when she had fini

ey were doing the thing in style, with fourteen dogs. they
had seen other sleds depart over the pass for dawson, or come in from
dawson, but never had they seen a sled with so many as fourteen dogs. in
the nature of arctic travel there was a reason why fourteen dogs should
not drag one sled, and that was that one sled could not carry the food
for fourteen dogs. but charles and hal did not know this. they had
worked the trip out with a pencil, so much to a dog, so many dogs,
so many days, q.e.d. mercedes looked over their shoulders and nodded
comprehensively, it was all so very simple.

late next morning buck led the long team up the street. there was
nothing lively about it, no snap or go in him and his fellows. they were
starting dead weary. four times he had covered the distance between salt
water and dawson, and the knowledge that, jaded and tired, he was facing
the same trail once more, made him bitter. his heart was not in
the work, nor was the heart of any dog. the outsides were timid an

it was inevitable that they should go short on dog-food. but they
hastened it by overfeeding, bringing the day nearer when underfeeding
would commence. the outside dogs, whose digestions had not been trained
by chronic famine to make the most of little, had voracious appetites.
and when, in addition to this, the worn-out huskies pulled weakly, hal
decided that the orthodox ration was too small. he doubled it. and to
cap it all, when mercedes, with tears in her pretty eyes and a quaver
in her throat, could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more, she
stole from the fish-sacks and fed them slyly. but it was not food that
buck and the huskies needed, but rest. and though they were making poor
time, the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely.

then came the underfeeding. hal awoke one day to the fact that his
dog-food was half gone and the distance only quarter covered; further,
that for love or money no addition

 to death on the
ration of the husky, so the six outside dogs under buck could do no less
than die on half the ration of the husky. the newfoundland went first,
followed by the three short-haired pointers, the two mongrels hanging
more grittily on to life, but going in the end.

by this time all the amenities and gentlenesses of the southland had
fallen away from the three people. shorn of its glamour and romance,
arctic travel became to them a reality too harsh for their manhood and
womanhood. mercedes ceased weeping over the dogs, being too occupied
with weeping over herself and with quarrelling with her husband and
brother. to quarrel was the one thing they were never too weary to do.
their irritability arose out of their misery, increased with it, doubled
upon it, outdistanced it. the wonderful patience of the trail which
comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore, and remain sweet of speech
and kindly, did not come to these two men and the woman. they had no
inkling of such a patience. th

ey were stiff and in pain; their muscles
ached, their bones ached, their very hearts ached; and because of this
they became sharp of speech, and hard words were first on their lips in
the morning and last at night.

charles and hal wrangled whenever mercedes gave them a chance. it was
the cherished belief of each that he did more than his share of the
work, and neither forbore to speak this belief at every opportunity.
sometimes mercedes sided with her husband, sometimes with her brother.
the result was a beautiful and unending family quarrel. starting from
a dispute as to which should chop a few sticks for the fire (a dispute
which concerned only charles and hal), presently would be lugged in the
rest of the family, fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins, people thousands
of miles away, and some of them dead. that hal’s views on art, or the
sort of society plays his mother’s brother wrote, should have
anything to do with the ch

comprehension; nevertheless the quarrel was as likely to tend in that
direction as in the direction of charles’s political prejudices. and
that charles’s sister’s tale-bearing tongue should be relevant to the
building of a yukon fire, was apparent only to mercedes, who disburdened
herself of copious opinions upon that topic, and incidentally upon a
few other traits unpleasantly peculiar to her husband’s family. in the
meantime the fire remained unbuilt, the camp half pitched, and the dogs
unfed.

mercedes nursed a special grievance--the grievance of sex. she was
pretty and soft, and had been chivalrously treated all her days. but
the present treatment by her husband and brother was everything save
chivalrous. it was her custom to be helpless. they comp

l things were thawing, bending, snapping. the yukon
was straining to break loose the ice that bound it down. it ate away
from beneath; the sun ate from above. air-holes formed, fissures sprang
and spread apart, while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into
the river. and amid all this bursting, rending, throbbing of awakening
life, under the blazing sun and through the soft-sighing breezes, like
wayfarers to death, staggered the two men, the woman, and the huskies.

with the dogs falling, mercedes weeping and riding, hal swearing
innocuously, and charles’s eyes wistfully watering, they staggered into
john thornton’s camp at the mouth of white river. when they halted,
the dogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead. mercedes
dried her eyes and looked at john thornton. charles sat down on a log
to rest. he sat down very slowly and painstakingly what of his great
stiffness. hal did the talking. john thornton was whittling the last
touches on an axe-handle he had made from

y numb. as though from a great distance, he was
aware that he was being beaten. the last sensations of pain left him. he
no longer felt anything, though very faintly he could hear the impact of
the club upon his body. but it was no longer his body, it seemed so far
away.

and then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was
inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, john thornton sprang
upon the man who wielded the club. hal was hurled backward, as
though struck by a falling tree. mercedes screamed. charles looked on
wistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his
stiffness.

john thornton stood over buck, struggling to control himself, too
convulsed with rage to speak.

“if you strike that dog again, i’ll kill you,” he at last managed to say
in a choking voice.

“it’s my dog,” hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came
back. “get out of my way, or i’ll fix you. i’m going to dawson.”

thornton stood between him and buck, and ev

inced no intention of getting
out of the way. hal drew his long hunting-knife. mercedes screamed,
cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
thornton rapped hal’s knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking the knife
to the ground. he rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up.
then he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes cut buck’s
traces.

hal had no fight left in him. besides, his hands were full with his
sister, or his arms, rather; while buck was too near dead to be of
further use in hauling the sled. a few minutes later they pu

from the bank and down the river. buck heard them go and raised his head
to see, pike was leading, sol-leks was at the wheel, and between were
joe and teek. they were limping and staggering. mercedes was riding the
loaded sled. hal guided at the gee-pole, and charles stumbled along in
the rear.

as buck watched them, thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly
hands searched for broken bones. by the time his search had disclosed
nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the
sled was a quarter of a mile away. dog and man watched it crawling along
over the ice. suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into a rut,
and the gee-pole, with hal clinging to it, je

rk into the air. mercedes’s
scream came to their ears. they saw charles turn and make one step to
run back, and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans
disappear. a yawning hole was all that was to be seen. the bottom had
dropped out of the trail.

john thornton and buck looked at each other.

“you poor devil,” said john thornton, and buck licked his hand.
