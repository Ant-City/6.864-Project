Mrs. Cheveley - 
      One of the play's wittiest and most well dressed characters, Mrs. Cheveley is the vicious and opportunistic villainness, a disciple of the deceased Baron Arnheim who values wealth and power above all. She stands as foil to the virtuous and earnest Lady Ch iltern, being cast throughout the play as a sort of monstrous femme fatale. Notably, Mrs. Cheveley is continuously imagined as the product of "horrid combinations" that evoke her duplicity. To take a few examples of how the play constructs her dou ble-dealing: one character in Act I describes her as the "unnatural" union of daytime genius and nighttime beauty. More viciously, Act III describes her as lamia-like--that is, reminiscent of a female demon, half woman and half snake. One could perha ps draw parallels between Mrs. Cheveley and the adventuresome Mrs. Erlynne from Lady Windermere's Fan.
