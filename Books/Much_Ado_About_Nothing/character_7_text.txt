   bora. yea my lord, but i can crosse it

   iohn. any barre, any crosse, any impediment, will be
medicinable to me, i am sicke in displeasure to him, and
whatsoeuer comes athwart his affection, ranges euenly
with mine, how canst thou crosse this marriage?
  bor. not honestly my lord, but so couertly, that no
dishonesty shall appeare in me

   iohn. shew me breefely how

   bor. i thinke i told your lordship a yeere since, how
much i am in the fauour of margaret, the waiting gentlewoman
to hero

   iohn. i remember

   bor. i can at any vnseasonable instant of the night,
appoint her to looke out at her ladies chamber window

   iohn. what life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?
  bor. the poyson of that lies in you to temper, goe
you to the prince your brother, spare not to tell him, that
hee hath wronged his honor in marrying the renowned
claudio, whose estimation do you mightily hold vp, to a
contaminated stale, such a one as

pedro and the count claudio alone, tell them that you
know that hero loues me, intend a kinde of zeale both
to the prince and claudio (as in a loue of your brothers
honor who hath made this match) and his friends reputation,
who is thus like to be cosen'd with the semblance
of a maid, that you haue discouer'd thus: they will scarcely
beleeue this without triall: offer them instances which
shall beare no lesse likelihood, than to see mee at her
chamber window, heare me call margaret, hero; heare
margaret terme me claudio, and bring them to see this
the very night before the intended wedding, for in the
meane time, i will so fashion the matter, that hero shall
be absent, and there shall appeare such seeming truths of
heroes disloyaltie, that iealousie shall be cal'd assurance,
and all the preparation ouerthrowne

   iohn. grow this to what aduerse issue it can, i will
put it in practise: be cunning in the working this, and
thy fee is a thousand ducates

no more paines for those thankes then you took paines
to thanke me, that's as much as to say, any paines that i
