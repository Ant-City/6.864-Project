hibellines which was proceeding
tempestuously at the other end of the room. it was a real catastrophe,
not a mere episode, that evening of hers at venice, when she had found
in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea, though one
better than something else.

â€œbut here you are as safe as in england. signora bertolini is so
english.â€

â€œyet our rooms smell,â€ said poor lucy. â€œwe dread going to bed.â€

â€œah, then you look into the court.â€ she sighed. â€œif only mr. emerson was
more tactful! we were so sorry for you at dinner.â€

â€œi think he was meaning to be kind.â€

â€œundoubtedly he was,â€ said miss bartlett.

â€œmr. beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature. of
course, i was holding back on my cousinâ€™s account.â€

â€œof course,â€ said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could
not be too careful with a young girl.

lucy tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool. no
one was careful with her at

it.

â€œabout old mr. emerson--i hardly know. no, he is not tactful; yet, have
you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most
indelicate, and yet at the same time--beautiful?â€

â€œbeautiful?â€ said miss bartlett, puzzled at the word. â€œare not beauty
and delicacy the same?â€

â€œso one would have thought,â€ said the other helplessly. â€œbut things are
so difficult, i sometimes think.â€

she proceeded no further into things, for mr. beebe reappeared, looking
extremely pleasant.

mr. emerson was talking about it in the smoking-room, and knowing what
i did, i encouraged him to make the offer again. he has let me come and
ask you. he would be so pleased.â€

â€œoh, charlotte,â€ cried lucy to her cousin, â€œwe must have the rooms now.
the old man is just as nice and kind as he can be.â€

miss bartlett was silent.

â€œi fear,â€ said mr. beebe, after a pause, â€œthat i have been officious. i
must apologize for my interference.â€

gravely displeased, he turned to go. not

till then did miss bartlett
reply: â€œmy own wishes, dearest lucy, are unimportant in comparison with
yours. it would be hard indeed if i stopped you doing as you liked at
florence, when i am only here through your kindness. if you wish me to
turn these gentlemen out of their rooms, i will do it. would you then,
mr. beebe, kindly tell mr. emerson that i accept his kind offer, and
then conduct him to me, in order that i may thank him personally?â€

she raised her voice as she spoke; it was heard all over the
drawing-room, and silenced the guelfs and the ghibellines. the
clergyman, inwardly cursing the female sex, bowed, and departed with her
message.

â€œremember, lucy, i alone am implicated in this. i do not wish the
acceptance to come from you. grant me that, at all events.â€

mr. beebe was back, saying rather nervously:

â€œmr. emerson is engaged, but here is his son instead.â€

the young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the
floor, so low were their chairs.

â€œmy father,â€ he said, â€œis in his bath, so you cannot thank him
personally. but any message given by you to me will be given by me to
him as soon as he comes out.â€

miss bartlett was unequal to the bath. all her barbed civilities came
forth wrong end first. young mr. emerson scored a notable triumph to the
delight of mr. beebe and to the secret delight of lucy.

â€œpoor young man!â€ said miss bartlett, as soon as he had gone.

â€œhow angry he is with his father about the rooms! it is all he can do to
keep polite.â€

â€œin half an hour or so your rooms will be ready,â€ said mr. beebe. then
looking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins, he retired to his own
rooms, to write up his philosophic diary.

or secret entrances. it was
then that she saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on
which was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation. nothing more.

â€œwhat does it mean?â€ she thought, and she examined it carefully by the
light of a candle. meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing,
obnoxious, portentous with evil. she was seized with an impulse to
destroy it, but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so,
since it must be the property of young mr. emerson. so she unpinned it
carefully, and put it between two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it
clean for him. then she completed her inspection of the room, sighed
heavily according to her habit, and went to bed.

bare room, with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are

uld this mean? they did it again and again. then lucy
realized that they had mistaken machiavelli for some saint, hoping
to acquire virtue. punishment followed quickly. the smallest he-baby
stumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by mr. ruskin,
and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop. protestant
as she was, lucy darted forward. she was too late. he fell heavily upon
the prelateâ€™s upturned toes.

â€œhateful bishop!â€ exclaimed the voice of old mr. emerson, who had darted
forward also. â€œhard in life, hard in death. go out into the sunshine,
little boy, and kiss your hand to the sun, for that is where you ought
to be. intolerable bishop!â€

the child screamed frantically at these words, and at these dreadful
people who picked him up, dusted him, rubbed his bruises, and told him
not to be superstitious.

â€œlook at him!â€ said mr. emerson to lucy. â€œhereâ€™s a mess: a baby hurt,
cold, and frightened! but what else can you expect from

the childâ€™s legs had become as melting wax. each time that old mr.
emerson and lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar. fortunately an
italian lady, who ought to have been saying her prayers, came to the
rescue. by some mysterious virtue, which mothers alone possess, she
stiffened the little boyâ€™s back-bone and imparted strength to his knees.
he stood. still gibbering with agitation, he walked away.

â€œyou are a clever woman,â€ said mr. emerson. â€œyou have done more than
all the relics in the world. i am not of your creed, but i do believe in
those who make their fellow-creatures happy. there is no scheme of the
universe--â€

he paused for a phrase.

â€œniente,â€ said the italian lady, and returned to her prayers.

â€œiâ€™m not sure she understands english,â€ suggested lucy.

in her chastened mood she no longer despised the emersons. she was
determined to be gracious to them, beautiful rather than delicate,

â€œthat woman understands everything,â€ was mr. emersonâ€™s reply. â€œbut what
are you doing here? are you doing the church? are you through with the
church?â€

â€œno,â€ cried lucy, remembering her grievance. â€œi came here with miss
lavish, who was to explain everything; and just by the door--it is too
bad!--she simply ran away, and after waiting quite a time, i had to come
in by myself.â€

â€œbut miss lavish has even taken away baedeker.â€

â€œbaedeker?â€ said mr. emerson. â€œiâ€™m glad itâ€™s that you minded. itâ€™s worth
minding, the loss of a baedeker. thatâ€™s worth minding.â€

lucy was puzzled. she was again conscious of some new idea, and was not
sure whither it would lead her.

â€œif youâ€™ve no baedeker,â€ said the son, â€œyouâ€™d better join us.â€ was this
where the idea would lead? she took refuge in her dignity.

e was saying, â€œthe facts about this church of santa croce;
how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism, before
any taint of the renaissance had appeared. observe how giotto in these
frescoes--now, unhappily, ruined by restoration--is untroubled by the
snares of anatomy and perspective. could anything be more majestic, more
pathetic, beautiful, true? how little, we feel, avails knowledge and
technical cleverness against a man who truly feels!â€

â€œno!â€ exclaimed mr. emerson, in much too loud a voice for church.
â€œremember nothing of the sort! built by faith indeed! that simply means
the workmen werenâ€™t paid properly. and as for the frescoes, i see no
truth in them. look at that fat man in blue! he must weigh as much as i
do, and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon.â€

he was referring to the fresco of the â€œascension of st. john.â€ inside,
the lecturerâ€™s voice faltered, as well it might. the audience shifted
uneasily, and so did lucy. s

â€œpardon me,â€ said a frigid voice. â€œthe chapel is somewhat small for two
parties. we will incommode you no longer.â€

the lecturer was a clergyman, and his audience must be also his flock,
for they held prayer-books as well as guide-books in their hands. they
filed out of the chapel in silence. amongst them were the two little old
ladies of the pension bertolini--miss teresa and miss catherine alan.

â€œstop!â€ cried mr. emerson. â€œthereâ€™s plenty of room for us all. stop!â€

the procession disappeared without a word.

soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel, describing the life
of st. francis.

â€œgeorge, i do believe that clergyman is the brixton curate.â€

george went into the next chapel and returned, saying â€œperhaps he is. i
donâ€™t remember.â€

â€œhe will not come back,â€ said george.

but mr. emerson, contrite and unhappy, hurried away to apologize to the
rev. cuthbert eager. lucy, apparently absorbed in a lunette, could hear
the lecture again interrupted, the anxious, aggressive voice of the old
man, the curt, injured replies of his opponent. the son, who took every
little contretemps as if it were a tragedy, was listening also.

â€œmy father has that effect on nearly everyone,â€ he informed her. â€œhe
will try to be kind.â€

â€œi hope we all try,â€ said she, smiling nervously.

own the chapel.
for a young man his face was rugged, and--until the shadows fell upon
it--hard. enshadowed, it sprang into tenderness. she saw him once again
at rome, on the ceiling of the sistine chapel, carrying a burden of
acorns. healthy and muscular, he yet gave her the feeling of greyness,
of tragedy that might only find solution in the night. the feeling soon
passed; it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle. born
of silence and of unknown emotion, it passed when mr. emerson returned,
and she could re-enter the world of rapid talk, which was alone familiar
to her.

â€œwere you snubbed?â€ asked his son tranquilly.

â€œbut we have spoilt the pleasure of i donâ€™t know how many people. they
wonâ€™t come back.â€

â€œ...full of innate sympathy...quickness to perceive good in
others...vision of the brotherhood of man...â€ scraps of the lecture on
st. francis came floating round the partition wall.

he did not know, and suggested that they should try to guess it. george,
rather to her relief, refused to move, and she and the old man wandered
not unpleasantly about santa croce, which, though it is like a barn,
has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls. there were also
beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars, and an old lady
with her dog, and here and there a priest modestly edging to his
mass through the groups of tourists. but mr. emerson was only half
interested. he watched the lecturer, whose success he believed he had
impaired, and then he anxiously watched his son.

â€œwhy will he look at that fresco?â€ he said uneasily. â€œi saw nothing in
it.â€

â€œi like giotto,â€ she replied. â€œit is so wonderful what they say about
his tactile values. though i like things like the della robbia babies

to this extraordinary speech lucy found no answer.

â€œand what is it?â€ asked lucy fearfully, expecting some harrowing tale.

â€œthe old trouble; things wonâ€™t fit.â€

â€œwhat things?â€

â€œthe things of the universe. it is quite true. they donâ€™t.â€

in his ordinary voice, so that she scarcely realized he was quoting

over the tombstones, seemed both pitiable and absurd. he approached, his
face in the shadow. he said:

â€œoh, good gracious me!â€ said lucy, suddenly collapsing and again seeing
the whole of life in a new perspective. â€œwhere? where?â€

â€œin the nave.â€

â€œi see. those gossiping little miss alans must have--â€ she checked
herself.

â€œpoor girl!â€ exploded mr. emerson. â€œpoor girl!â€

she could not let this pass, for it was just what she was feeling
herself.

â€œpoor girl? i fail to understand the point of that remark. i think
myself a very fortunate girl, i assure you. iâ€™m thoroughly happy, and
having a splendid time. pray donâ€™t waste time mourning over me. thereâ€™s

that some sonatas of beethoven are written tragic no one can gainsay;
yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides, and lucy had
decided that they should triumph.

a very wet afternoon at the bertolini permitted her to do the thing she
really liked, and after lunch she opened the little draped piano. a few
people lingered round and praised her playing, but finding that she
made no reply, dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or
to sleep. she took no notice of mr. emerson looking for his son, nor of
miss bartlett looking for miss lavish, nor of miss lavish looking for
her cigarette-case. like every true performer, she was intoxicated by
the mere feel of the notes: they were fingers caressing her own; and by
touch, not by sound alone, did she come to her desire.

mr. beebe, sitting unnoticed in the window, pondered this illogical
element in miss honeychurch, and recalled the occasion at tunbridge
wells when he had discovered it. it was at one of those ent

miss alan was always thus being charitable against her better judgement.
a delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks, giving them
unexpected beauty, just as in the decaying autumn woods there sometimes
rise odours reminiscent of spring. she felt she had made almost too many
allowances, and apologized hurriedly for her toleration.

â€œall the same, she is a little too--i hardly like to say unwomanly, but
she behaved most strangely when the emersons arrived.â€

mr. beebe smiled as miss alan plunged into an anecdote which he knew she
would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman.

â€œi donâ€™t know, miss honeychurch, if you have noticed that miss pole, the
lady who has so much yellow hair, takes lemonade. that old mr. emerson,
who puts things very strangely--â€

her jaw dropped. she was silent. mr. beebe, whose social resources were
endless, went out to order some tea, and she continued to lucy in a
hasty whisper:

speaking. i reminded her how the queen had been to ireland when she did
not want to go, and i must say she was dumbfounded, and made no reply.
but, unluckily, mr. emerson overheard this part, and called in his deep
voice: â€˜quite so, quite so! i honour the woman for her irish visit.â€™ the
woman! i tell things so badly; but you see what a tangle we were in
by this time, all on account of s. having been mentioned in the first
place. but that was not all. after dinner miss lavish actually came up
and said: â€˜miss alan, i am going into the smoking-room to talk to those
two nice men. come, too.â€™ needless to say, i refused such an unsuitable
invitation, an

â€œlet me finish the story,â€ said mr. beebe, who had returned.

â€œmiss lavish tried miss pole, myself, everyone, and finally said:
â€˜i shall go alone.â€™ she went. at the end of five minutes she returned
unobtrusively with a green baize board, and began playing patience.â€

â€œwhatever happened?â€ cried lucy.

â€œno one knows. no one will ever know. miss lavish will never dare to
tell, and mr. emerson does not think it worth telling.â€

â€œmr. beebe--old mr. emerson, is he nice or not nice? i do so want to
know.â€

mr. beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for
herself.

â€œno; but it is so difficult. sometimes he is so silly, and then i do not
mind him. miss alan, what do you think? is he nice?â€

the little old lady shook her head, and sighed disapprovingly. mr.
beebe, whom the conversation amused, stirred her up by saying:

â€œi consider that you

â€œviolets? oh, dear! who told you about the violets? how do things get
round? a pension is a bad place for gossips. no, i cannot forget how
they behaved at mr. eagerâ€™s lecture at santa croce. oh, poor miss
honeychurch! it really was too bad. no, i have quite changed. i do not
like the emersons. they are not nice.â€

mr. beebe smiled nonchalantly. he had made a gentle effort to introduce
the emersons into bertolini society, and the effort had failed. he was
almost the only person who remained friendly to them. miss lavish, who
represented intellect, was avowedly hostile, and now the miss alans,
who stood for good breeding, were following her. miss bartlett, smarting
under an obligation, would scarcely be civil. the case of lucy was
different. she had given him a hazy account of her adventures in santa
croce, and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and possibly

ing about a debt. â€œcinque
lire,â€ they had cried, â€œcinque lire!â€ they sparred at each other, and
one of them was hit lightly upon the chest. he frowned; he bent towards
lucy with a look of interest, as if he had an important message for her.
he opened his lips to deliver it, and a stream of red came out between
them and trickled down his unshaven chin.

that was all. a crowd rose out of the dusk. it hid this extraordinary
man from her, and bore him away to the fountain. mr. george emerson
happened to be a few paces away, looking at her across the spot where
the man had been. how very odd! across something. even as she caught
sight of him he grew dim; the palace itself grew dim, swayed above her,
fell on to her softly, slowly, noiselessly, and the sky fell with it.

she thought: â€œoh, what have i done?â€

â€œoh, what have i done?â€ she murmured, and opened her eyes.

george emerson still looked at her, but not across anything. she had
complained of dullness, and lo!

â€œi had rather be alone.â€

he said imperiously: â€œthe man is dead--the man is probably dead; sit
down till you are rested.â€ she was bewildered, and obeyed him. â€œand
donâ€™t move till i come back.â€

in the distance she saw creatures with black hoods, such as appear in
dreams. the palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day,
and joined itself to earth. how should she talk to mr. emerson when he
returned from the shadowy square? again the thought occurred to her,
â€œoh, what have i done?â€--the thought that she, as well as the dying man,
had crossed some spiritual boundary.

he returned, and she talked of the murder. oddly enough, it was an easy
topic. she spoke of the italian character; she became almost garrulous
over the incident that had made her faint five minutes before. being
strong physically, she soon overcame the horror of blood. she rose

â€œand the murderer tried to kiss him, you say--how very odd italians

he had thrown something into the stream.

â€œwhat did you throw in?â€

he was silent.

â€œi believe it was my photographs that you threw away.â€

â€œi didnâ€™t know what to do with them,â€ he cried, and his voice was that
of an anxious boy. her heart warmed towards him for the first time.
â€œthey were covered with blood. there! iâ€™m glad iâ€™ve told you; and all
the time we were making conversation i was wondering what to do with

tremendous has happened; i must face it without getting muddled. it
isnâ€™t exactly that a man has died.â€

something warned lucy that she must stop him.

â€œit has happened,â€ he repeated, â€œand i mean to find out what it is.â€

he turned towards her frowning, as if she had disturbed him in some
abstract quest.

times a magic in identity of position; it is one of the things that have

happen, and then one returns to the old life!â€

â€œi donâ€™t.â€

anxiety moved her to question him.

his answer was puzzling: â€œi shall probably want to live.â€

â€œbut why, mr. emerson? what do you mean?â€

â€œi shall want to live, i say.â€

leaning her elbows on the parapet, she contemplated the river arno,
whose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears.

coming back, and the young officials there, who seemed impudent and
desoeuvre, had tried to search their reticules for provisions. it might
have been most unpleasant. fortunately miss lavish was a match for any
one.

for good or for evil, lucy was left to face her problem alone. none
of her friends had seen her, either in the piazza or, later on, by
the embankment. mr. beebe, indeed, noticing her startle

bartlett and miss honeychurch join the party? charlotte declined for
herself; she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon. but
she thought it an admirable idea for lucy, who hated shopping, changing
money, fetching letters, and other irksome duties--all of which miss
bartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish alone.

â€œno, charlotte!â€ cried the girl, with real warmth. â€œitâ€™s very kind of
mr. beebe, but i am cer

lucy fidgeted; it was tiresome of charlotte to have stopped exactly
where she did.

â€œlook, lucia! oh, you are watching for the torre del gallo party. i
feared you would repent you of your choice.â€

serious as the choice had been, lucy did not repent. yesterday had been
a muddle--queer and odd, the kind of thing one could not write down
easily on paper--but she had a feeling that charlotte and her shopping
were preferable to george emerson and the summit of the torre del
gallo. since she could not unravel the tangle, she must take care not
to re-enter it. she could protest sincerely against miss bartlettâ€™s
insinuations.

but though she had avoided the chief actor, the scenery unfortunately
remained. charlotte, with the complacency of fate, led her from the
river to the piazza signoria. she could not have believed that stones, a
loggia, a fountain, a palace tower, would have such significance. for a
moment she understoo

hope you will excuse me for boring on like this,â€ miss lavish
concluded. â€œit is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people.
of course, this is the barest outline. there will be a deal of local
colouring, descriptions of florence and the neighbourhood, and i shall
also introduce some humorous characters. and let me give you all fair
warning: i intend to be unmerciful to the british tourist.â€

â€œoh, you wicked woman,â€ cried miss bartlett. â€œi am sure you are thinking
of the emersons.â€

miss lavish gave a machiavellian smile.

â€œi confess that in italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen.
it is the neglected italians who attract me, and whose lives i am going
to paint so far as i can. for i repeat and i insist, and i have always
held most strongly, that a tragedy such as yesterdayâ€™s is not the less
tragic because it happened in humble life.â€

there was a fitting silence when miss lavish had concluded. then the

bartlett, adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver.

â€œfor her also it must have been a terrible experience. i trust that
neither of you was at all--that it was not in your immediate proximity?â€

of the many things lucy was noticing to-day, not the least remarkable
was this: the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble
after blood. george emerson had kept the subject strangely pure.

â€œhe died by the fountain, i believe,â€ was her reply.

â€œand you and your friend--â€

â€œwere over at the loggia.â€

â€œthat must have saved you much. you have not, of course, seen the
disgraceful illustrations which the gutter press--this man is a public

â€œhow wonderfully people rise in these days!â€ sighed miss bartlett,
fingering a model of the leaning tower of pisa.

â€œgenerally,â€ replied mr. eager, â€œone has only sympathy for their
success. the desire for education and for social advance--in these
things there is something not wholly vile. there are some working men
whom one would be very willing to see out here in florence--little as
they would make of it.â€

lucy was recalled to her manners, and after a little exertion the
complacency of mr. eager was restored.

â€œbother the drive!â€ exclaimed the girl, as soon as he had departed. â€œit
is just the drive we had arranged with mr. beebe without any fuss at
all. why should he invite us in that absurd manner? we might as well
invite him. we are each paying for ourselves.â€

miss bartlett, who had intended to lament over the emersons, was
launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts.

â€œif that is so, dear--if the drive we and mr. beebe are going with mr.
eager is really the same as the one we are going with mr. beebe, then i
foresee a sad kettle of fish.â€

â€œhow?â€

â€œbecause mr. beebe has asked eleanor lavish to come, too.â€

â€œthat will mean another carriage.â€

â€œfar worse. mr. eager does not like eleanor. she knows it herself. the
truth must be told; she is too unconventional for him.â€

miss bartlett, with equal vivacity, replied:

â€œoh, you droll person! pray, what would become of your drive in the
hills?â€

they passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square, laughing
over the unpractical suggestion.



chapter vi: the reverend arthur beebe, the reverend cuthbert eager,
mr. emerson, mr. george emerson, miss eleanor lavish, miss charlotte
bartlett, and miss lucy honeychurch drive out in carriages to see a
view; italians drive them.

it was phaethon who drove them to fiesole that memorable day, a youth
all irresponsibility and fire, recklessly urging his masterâ€™s horses up
the stony hill. mr. beebe recognized him at once. neither the ages of
faith nor the age of doubt had touched him; he was phaethon in tuscany
driving a cab. and it was persephone whom he asked le

clear that it was a very great favour, the goddess was allowed to mount
beside the god.

phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head, thus enabling
himself to drive with his arm round her waist. she did not mind.
mr. eager, who sat with his back to the horses, saw nothing of the
indecorous proceeding, and continued his conversation with lucy. the
other two occupants of the carriage were old mr. emerson and miss
lavish. for a dreadful thing had happened: mr. beebe, without consulting
mr. eager, had doubled the size of the party. and though miss bartlett
and miss lavish had planned all the morning how the people were to sit,
at the critical moment when the carriages came round they lost their
heads, and miss lavish got in with lucy, while miss bartlett, with
george emerson and mr. beebe, followed on behind.

it was hard on the poor chaplain to have his partie carree thus
transformed. t

ea at a renaissance villa, if he had ever meditated it,
was now impossible. lucy and miss bartlett had a certain style about
them, and mr. beebe, though unreliable, was a man of parts. but a shoddy
lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the sight of
god--they should enter no villa at his introduction.

lucy, elegantly dressed in white, sat erect and nervous amid these
explosive ingredients, attentive to mr. eager, repressive towards miss
lavish, watchful of old mr. emerson, hitherto fortunately asleep, thanks
to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of spring. she looked on the
expedition as the work of fate. but for it she would have avoided george
emerson successfully. in an open manner he had shown that he wished to
continue their intimacy. she had refused, not because she disliked him,
but because she did not know what had happened, and suspected that he
did know. and this frightened her.

settignano road.

â€œpiano! piano!â€ said mr. eager, elegantly waving his hand over his head.

â€œva bene, signore, va bene, va bene,â€ crooned the driver, and whipped
his horses up again.

now mr. eager and miss lavish began to talk against each other on the
subject of alessio baldovinetti. was he a cause of the renaissance, or
was he one of its manifestations? the other carriage was left behind. as
the pace increased to a gallop the large, slumbering form of mr. emerson
was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a machine.

â€œpiano! piano!â€ said he, with a martyred look at lucy.

an extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat. phaethon, who for some
time had been endeavouring to kiss persephone, had just succeeded.

a little scene ensued, which, as miss bartlett said afterwards, was
most unpleasant. the horses were stopped, the lovers were ordered to
disentangle themselves, the boy was to lose his pourboire, the girl was

 to get down.

â€œshe is my sister,â€ said he, turning round on them with piteous eyes.

mr. eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar.

phaethon hung down his head, not at the matter of the accusation, but
at its manner. at this point mr. emerson, whom the shock of stopping
had awoke, declared that the lovers must on no account be separated, and
patted them on the back to signify his approval. and miss lavish, though
unwilling to ally him, felt bound to support the cause of bohemianism.

â€œmost certainly i would let them be,â€ she cried. â€œbut i dare say i
shall receive scant support. i have always flown in the face of the
conventions all my life. this is what i call an adventure.â€

â€œwe must not submit,â€ said mr. eager

treating us as if we were a party of cookâ€™s tourists.â€

â€œsurely no!â€ said miss lavish, her ardour visibly decreasing.

the other carriage had drawn up behind, and sensible mr. beebe
called out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave
themselves properly.

â€œleave them alone,â€ mr. emerson begged the chaplain, of whom he stood
in no awe. â€œdo we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the
box when it happens to sit there? to be driven by lovers--a king might
envy us, and if we part them itâ€™s more like sacrilege than anything i
know.â€

here the voice of miss bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun
to collect.

mr. eager, who suffered from an over-fluent tongue rather than a
resolute will, was determined to make himself heard. he addressed the

â€œsignorina!â€ said the man to lucy, when the display had ceased. why
should he appeal to lucy?

â€œsignorina!â€ echoed persephone in her glorious contralto. she pointed at
the other carriage. why?

for a moment the two girls looked at each other. then persephone got
down from the box.

â€œvictory at last!â€ said mr. eager, smiting his hands together as the
carriages started again.

â€œit is not victory,â€ said mr. emerson. â€œit is defeat. you have parted
two people who were happy.â€

mr. eager shut his eyes. he was obliged to sit next to mr. emerson, but
he would not speak to him. the old man was refreshed by sleep, and took
up the matter warmly. he commanded lucy to agree with him; he shouted
for support to his son.

â€œwe have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money. he has bargained
to drive us, and he is doing it. we have no rights over his soul.â€

but it is not easy to carry the pictures of alessio baldovinetti in your
head, even if you have remembered to look at them before starting. and
the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest.

the party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass, their anxiety to keep
together being only equalled by their desire to go different directions.
finally they split into groups. lucy clung to miss bartlett and miss
lavish; the emersons returned to hold laborious converse with the
drivers; while the two clergymen, who were expected to have topics in
common, were left to each other.

the two elder ladies soon threw off the mask. in the audible whisper
that was now so familiar to lucy they began to discuss, not alessio
baldovinetti, but the drive. miss bartlett had asked mr. george emerson
what his profession was, and he had answered â€œthe railway.â€ she was very
sorry that she had asked him. she had no idea that it w

ould be such a
dreadful answer, or she would not have asked him. mr. beebe had turned
the conversation so cleverly, and she hoped that the young man was not
very much hurt at her asking him.

â€œthe railway!â€ gasped miss lavish. â€œoh, but i shall die! of course it
was the railway!â€ she could not control her mirth. â€œhe is the image of a
porter--on, on the south-eastern.â€

â€œeleanor, be quiet,â€ plucking at her vivacious companion. â€œhush! theyâ€™ll

â€œi canâ€™t stop. let me go my wicked way. a porter--â€

â€œeleanor!â€

â€œiâ€™m sure itâ€™s all right,â€ put in lucy. â€œthe emersons wonâ€™t hear, and
they wouldnâ€™t mind if they did.â€

miss lavish did not seem pleased at this.

â€œmiss honeychurch listening!â€ she said rather crossly. â€œpouf! wouf! you
naughty girl! go away!â€

â€œoh, lucy, you ought to be with mr. eager, iâ€™m sure.â€

before she could speak, almost before she could feel, a voice called,
â€œlucy! lucy! lucy!â€ the silence of life had been broken by miss bartlett
who stood brown against the view.



chapter vii: they return

some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the
afternoon. what it was and exactly how the players had sided, lucy
was slow to discover. mr. eager had met them with a questioning eye.
charlotte had repulsed him with much small talk. mr. emerson, seeking
his son, was told whereabouts to find him. mr. beebe, who wore the
heated aspect of a neutral, was bidden to collect the factions for the
return home. there was a general sense of groping and bewilderment. pan
had been amongst them--not the great god pan, who has been buried these
two thousand years, but the little god pan, who presides over social
contretemps and unsuccessful picnics. mr. beebe had lost everyone, and
had consumed in solitude the tea-basket which he had brought

up as a
pleasant surprise. miss lavish had lost miss bartlett. lucy had lost mr.
eager. mr. emerson had lost george. miss bartlett had lost a mackintosh
square. phaethon had lost the game.

that last fact was undeniable. he climbed on to the box shivering, with
his collar up, prophesying the swift approach of bad weather. â€œlet us go
immediately,â€ he told them. â€œthe signorino will walk.â€

â€œall the way? he will be hours,â€ said mr. beebe.

â€œapparently. i told him it was unwise.â€ he would look no one in the
face; perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him. he alo

 cousinâ€™s hand. at
times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care
not what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it
afterwards. miss bartlett, by this timely exercise of her muscles,
gained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross
examination.

she renewed it when the two carriages stopped, half into florence.

â€œmr. eager!â€ called mr. beebe. â€œwe want your assistance. will you
interpret for us?â€

â€œgeorge!â€ cried mr. emerson. â€œask your driver which way george went. the
boy may lose his way. he may be killed.â€

â€œgo, mr. eager,â€ said miss bartlett, â€œdonâ€™t ask our driver; our driver is
no help. go and support poor mr. beebe--, he is nearly demented.â€

â€œhe may be killed!â€ cried the old man. â€œhe may be killed!â€

the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down.â€

he drew her young cousin affectionately
to her. all the way back lucyâ€™s body was shaken by deep sighs, which
nothing could repress.

â€œi want to be truthful,â€ she whispered. â€œit is so hard to be absolutely
truthful.â€

â€œdonâ€™t be troubled, dearest. wait till you are calmer. we will talk it
over before bed-time in my room.â€

so they re-entered the city with hands clasped. it was a shock to the
girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others. the storm had ceased,
and mr. emerson was easier about his son. mr. beebe had regained good
humour, and mr. eager was already snubbing miss lavish. charlotte alone
she was sure of--charlotte, whose exterior concealed so much insight and
love.

the luxury of self-exposure kept her almost happy through the long
evening. she thought not so much of what had happened as of how she
should describe it. all her sensations, her spasms of courage, her
moments of unreasonable joy, her mysterious discontent, should be

shadows on the bolted door. a tram roared by in the dark, and lucy felt
unaccountably sad, though she had long since dried her eyes. she lifted
them to the ceiling, where the griffins and bassoons were colourless and
vague, the very ghosts of joy.

â€œit has been raining for nearly four hours,â€ she said at last.

miss bartlett ignored the remark.

â€œhow do you propose to silence him?â€

â€œthe driver?â€

â€œmy dear girl, no; mr. george emerson.â€

lucy began to pace up and down the room.

â€œi donâ€™t understand,â€ she said at last.

she understood very well, but she no longer wished to be absolutely
truthful.

â€œhow are you going to stop him talking about it?â€

â€œi have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do.â€

â€œi, too, intend to judge him charitably. but unfortunately i have met
the type before. they seldom keep their exploits to themselves.â€

â€œexploits?â€ cried lucy, wincing under the horrib

up, did not see her.

to reach his room he had to go by hers. she was still dressed. it struck
her that she might slip into the passage and just say that she would
be gone before he was up, and that their extraordinary intercourse was
over.

whether she would have dared to do this was never proved. at the
critical moment miss bartlett opened her own door, and her voice said:

â€œi wish one word with you in the drawing-room, mr. emerson, please.â€

soon their footsteps returned, and miss bartlett said: â€œgood-night, mr.
emerson.â€

his heavy, tired breathing was the only reply; the chaperon had done her
work.

lucy cried aloud: â€œit isnâ€™t true. it canâ€™t all be true. i want not to be
muddled. i want to grow older quickly.â€

honeychurch exclaimed. â€œdo you notice, lucy, iâ€™m always right? i said
donâ€™t interfere with cissie villa. iâ€™m always right. iâ€™m quite uneasy at
being always right so often.â€

â€œitâ€™s only another muddle of freddyâ€™s. freddy doesnâ€™t even know the name
of the people he pretends have taken it instead.â€

â€œyes, i do. iâ€™ve got it. emerson.â€

â€œemerson. iâ€™ll bet you anything you like.â€

then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky. mr. beebe,
whose opinion of her rose daily, whispered to his niece that that was
the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong.

meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted mrs. honeychurch from

â€œemerson, freddy? do you know what emersons they are?â€

â€œi donâ€™t know whether theyâ€™re any emersons,â€ retorted freddy, who was
democratic. like his sister and like most young people, he was naturally
attracted by the idea of equality, and the undeniable fact that there
are different kinds of emersons annoyed him beyond measure.

â€œi trust they are the right sort of person. all right, lucyâ€--she was
sitting up again--â€œi see you looking down your nose and thinking your
motherâ€™s a snob. but there is a right sort and a wrong sort, and itâ€™s
affectation to pretend there isnâ€™t.â€

â€œemersonâ€™s a common enough name,â€ lucy remarked.

â€œi was merely going to remark, freddy, that i trusted they were no
relations of emerson the philosopher, a most trying man. pray, does that
satisfy you?â€

â€œoh, yes,â€ he grumbled. â€œand you will be satisfied, too, for theyâ€™re
friends of cecil; soâ€--elaborate irony--â€œyou and the other country
families will be able to call in perfect safety.â€

it was hard on lucy. mr. beebe sympathized with her very much. while she
believed that her snub about the miss alans came from sir harry otway,
she had borne it like a good girl. she might well â€œscreechâ€ when
she heard that it came partly from her lover. mr. vyse was a
tease--something worse than a tease: he took a malicious pleasure
in thwarting people. the clergyman, knowing this, looked at miss
honeychurch with more than his usual kindness.

when she exclaimed, â€œbut cecilâ€™s emersons--they canâ€™t possibly be the
same ones--there is that--â€ he did not consider that the exclamation
was strange, but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation
while she recovered her composure. he diverted it as follows:

â€œthe emersons who were at florence, do you mean? no, i donâ€™t suppose it
will prove to be them. it is probably a long cry from them to friends
of mr. vyseâ€™s. oh, mrs. honeychurch, the oddest people! the queerest
people! for our part we liked them, d

great scene over some violets. they picked violets and
filled all the vases in the room of these very miss alans who have
failed to come to cissie villa. poor little ladies! so shocked and so
pleased. it used to be one of miss catharineâ€™s great stories. â€˜my dear
sister loves flowers,â€™ it began. they found the whole room a mass of
blue--vases and jugs--and the story ends with â€˜so ungentlemanly and yet
so beautiful.â€™ it is all very difficult. yes, i always connect those
florentine emersons with violets.â€

â€œfiascoâ€™s done you this time,â€ remarked freddy, not seeing that his
sisterâ€™s face was very red. she could not recover herself. mr. beebe saw
it, and continued to divert the conversation.

â€œthese particular emersons consisted of a father and a son--the son
a goodly, if not a good young man; not a fool, i fancy, but very
immature--pessimism, et cetera. our special joy was the father--such a
sentimental darling, and people declared he had murdered his wife.â€

lucy asked her brother whether cecil was in.

â€œoh, donâ€™t go!â€ he cried, and tried to catch her by the ankles.

â€œi must go,â€ she said gravely. â€œdonâ€™t be silly. you always overdo it
when you play.â€

as she left them her motherâ€™s shout of â€œharris!â€ shivered the tranquil
air, and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it
right. such a senseless lie, too, yet it shattered her nerves and
made her connect these emersons, friends of cecilâ€™s, with a pair of
nondescript tourists. hitherto truth had come to her naturally. she
saw that for the future she must be more vigilant, and be--absolutely
truthful? well, at all events, she must not tell lies. she hurried up
the garden, still flushed with shame. a word from cecil would soothe
her, she was sure.

that his own smart friends were supplanting the miss alans, she had
not minded. he perceived that these new tenants might be of value

bring them to windy corner.

the comic muse, though able to look after her own interests, did not
disdain the assistance of mr. vyse. his idea of bringing the emersons to
windy corner struck her as decidedly good, and she carried through the
negotiations without a hitch. sir harry otway signed the agreement,
met mr. emerson, who was duly disillusioned. the miss alans were
duly offended, and wrote a dignified letter to lucy, whom they held
responsible for the failure. mr. beebe planned pleasant moments for the
new-comers, and told mrs. honeychurch that freddy must call on them as
soon as they arrived. indeed, so ample was the museâ€™s equipment that sh

lucy--to descend from bright heaven to earth, whereon there are shadows
because there are hills--lucy was at first plunged into despair, but
settled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least.
now that she was engaged, the emersons would scarcely insult her and
were welcome into the neighbourhood. and cecil was welcome to bring whom
he would into the neighbourhood. therefore cecil was welcome to bring
the emersons into the neighbourhood. but, as i say, this took a little
thinking, and--so illogical are girls--the event remained rather greater
and rather more dreadful than it should have done. she was glad that
a visit to mrs. vyse now fell due; the tenants moved into cissie villa

it had been forwarded from windy corner.


â€œtunbridge wells,

â€œseptember.

â€œdearest lucia,

â€œi have news of you at last! miss lavish has been bicycling in your
parts, but was not sure whether a call would be welcome. puncturing
her tire near summer street, and it being mended while she sat very
woebegone in that pretty churchyard, she saw to her astonishment, a door
open opposite and the younger emerson man come out. he said his father
had just taken the house. he said he did not know that you lived in the
neighbourhood (?). he never suggested giving eleanor a cup of tea. dear
lucy, i am much worried, and i advise you to make a clean breast of his
past behaviour to your mother, freddy, and mr. vyse, who will forbid him
to enter the house, etc. that was a great misfortune, and i dare say you
have told them already. mr. vyse is so sensitive. i remember how i used
to get on his nerves at r

lucy was much annoyed, and replied as follows:

â€œdear charlotte,

â€œmany thanks for your warning. when mr. emerson forgot himself on the
mountain, you made me promise not to tell mother, because you said she
would blame you for not being always with me. i have kept that promise,
and cannot possibly tell her now. i have said both to her and cecil
that i met the emersons at florence, and that they are respectable
people--which i do think--and the reason that he offered miss lavish no
tea was probably that he had none himself. she should have tried at the
rectory. i cannot begin making a fuss at this st

it would be too absurd. if the emersons heard i had complained of them,
they would think themselves of importance, which is exactly what they
are not. i like the old father, and look forward to seeing him again.
as for the son, i am sorry for him when we meet, rather than for myself.
they are known to cecil, who is very well and spoke of you the other
day. we expect to be married in january.

corner at all, but here. please do not put â€˜privateâ€™ outs

nâ€™t such a fool, mr. beebe.â€

mr. beebe ignored the remark.

â€œlucy used to be nearly as stupid as i am, but itâ€™ll be very different
now, mother thinks. she will read all kinds of books.â€

â€œso will you.â€

â€œonly medical books. not books that you can talk about afterwards. cecil
is teaching lucy italian, and he says her playing is wonderful. there
are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed. cecil says--â€

â€œwhat on earth are those people doing upstairs? emerson--we think weâ€™ll
come another time.â€

george ran down-stairs and pushed them into the room without speaking.

â€œlet me introduce mr. honeychurch, a neighbour.â€

then freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth. perhaps he was shy,
perhaps he was friendly, or perhaps he thought that georgeâ€™s face wanted
washing. at all events he greeted him with, â€œhow dâ€™ye do? come and have
a bathe.â€

â€œoh, all right,â€ said george, impassive.

mr. beebe was highly entertained.

â€œâ€˜how dâ€™ye do? how dâ€™ye do? come and have a bathe,â€™â€ he chuckled.
â€œthatâ€™s the best conversational opening iâ€™ve ever heard. but iâ€™m afraid
it will only act between men. can you picture a lady who has been
introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with â€˜how
do you do? come and have a batheâ€™? and yet you will tell me that the
sexes are equal.â€

â€œi tell you that they shall be,â€ said mr. emerson, who had been slowly
descending the stairs. â€œgood afternoon, mr. beebe. i tell you they shall
be comrades, and george thinks the same.â€

â€œwe are to raise ladies to our level?â€ the clergyman inquired.

â€œthe garden of eden,â€ pursued mr. emerson, still descending, â€œwhich you
place in the past, is really yet to come. we shall enter it when we no
longer despise our bodies.â€

mr. beebe disclaimed placing the garden of eden anywhere.

â€œnot a bit!â€ mumbled freddy. â€œi must--that is to say, i have to--have
the pleasure of calling on you later on, my mother says, i hope.â€

â€œcall, my lad? who taught us that drawing-room twaddle? call on your
grandmother! listen to the wind among the pines! yours is a glorious
country.â€

mr. beebe came to the rescue.

â€œmr. emerson, he will call, i shall call; you or your son will return
our calls before ten days have elapsed. i trust that you have realized
about the ten daysâ€™ interval. it does not count that i helped you with
the stair-eyes yesterday. it does not count that they are going to bathe
this afternoon.â€

â€œyes, go and bathe, george. why do you dawdle talking? bring them back
to tea. bring back some milk, cakes, honey. the change will do you good.
george has been working very hard at his office. i

george bowed his head, dusty and sombre, exhaling the peculiar smell of
one who has handled furniture.

â€œdo you really want this bathe?â€ freddy asked him. â€œit is only a pond,
donâ€™t you know. i dare say you are used to something better.â€

â€œyes--i have said â€˜yesâ€™ already.â€

mr. beebe felt bound to assist his young friend, and led the way out
of the house and into the pine-woods. how glorious it was! for a little
time the voice of old mr. emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes
and philosophy. it ceased, and they only heard the fair wind blowing the
bracken and the trees. mr. beebe, who could be silent, but who could not
bear silence, was compelled to chatter, since the expedition looked like
a failure, and neither of his companions would utter a word. he spoke of
florence. george attended gravely, assenting or dissenting with slight
but determined gestures that were as inexplicable as the motions of the
tree-tops above their

to his relief, george began to talk.

â€œit is. i have reflected. it is fate. everything is fate. we are flung
together by fate, drawn apart by fate--flung together, drawn apart. the
twelve winds blow us--we settle nothing--â€

â€œyou have not reflected at all,â€ rapped the clergyman. â€œlet me give you
a useful tip, emerson: attribute nothing to fate. donâ€™t say, â€˜i didnâ€™t
do this,â€™ for you did it, ten to one. now iâ€™ll cross-question you. where
did you first meet miss honeychurch and myself?â€

chapter xiii: how miss bartlettâ€™s boiler was so tiresome

how often had lucy rehearsed this bow, this interview! but she had
always rehearsed them indoors, and with certain accessories, which
surely we have a right to assume. who could foretell that she and george
would meet in the rout of a civilization, amidst an army of coats
and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth? she had
imagined a young mr. emerson, who might be shy or morbid or indifferent
or furtively impudent. she was prepared for all of these. but she had
never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with the shout of
the morning star.

indoors herself, partaking of tea with old mrs. butterworth, she
reflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree
of accuracy, that it is impossible to rehearse life. a fault in the
scenery, a face in the audience, an irruption of the audience on to the
stage, and a

o?--and then freddy came bounding upstairs, and
joined the ranks of the ill-behaved.

â€œi say, those are topping people.â€

â€œmy dear baby, how tiresome youâ€™ve been! you have no business to take
them bathing in the sacred lake; itâ€™s much too public. it was all right for
you but most awkward for everyone else. do be more careful. you forget
the place is growing half suburban.â€

â€œi say, is anything on to-morrow week?â€

â€œnot that i know of.â€

â€œthen i want to ask the emersons up to sunday tennis.â€

â€œoh, i wouldnâ€™t do that, freddy, i wouldnâ€™t do that with all this
muddle.â€

â€œwhatâ€™s wrong with the court? they wonâ€™t mind a bump or two, and iâ€™ve
ordered new balls.â€

â€œi meant itâ€™s better not. i really mean it.â€

he seized her by the elbows and humorously danced her up and down the
passage. she pretended not to mind, but she could have screamed with
temper. cecil glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they

ness went out of life. it generally did at windy corner.
at the last minute, when the social machine was clogged hopelessly, one
member or other of the family poured in a drop of oil. cecil despised
their methods--perhaps rightly. at all events, they were not his own.

dinner was at half-past seven. freddy gabbled the grace, and they drew
up their heavy chairs and fell to. fortunately, the men were hungry.
nothing untoward occurred until the pudding. then freddy said:

â€œlucy, whatâ€™s emerson like?â€

â€œi saw him in florence,â€ said lucy, hoping that this would pass for a
reply.

â€œis he the clever sort, or is he a decent chap?â€

â€œask cecil; it is cecil who brought him here.â€

â€œhe is the clever sort, like myself,â€ said cecil.

freddy looked at him doubtfully.

â€œhow well did you know them at the bertolini?â€ asked mrs. honeychurch.

â€œoh, very slightly. i mean, charlotte knew them even less than i did.â€

â€œoh, that reminds me--you never told me w

ggs, boilers, hydrangeas,
maids--of such were their lives compact. â€œmay me and lucy get down from
our chairs?â€ he asked, with scarcely veiled insolence. â€œwe donâ€™t want no
dessert.â€



chapter xiv: how lucy faced the external situation bravely

of course miss bartlett accepted. and, equally of course, she felt sure
that she would prove a nuisance, and begged to be given an inferior
spare room--something with no view, anything. her love to lucy. and,
equally of course, george emerson could come to tennis on the sunday
week.

lucy faced the situation bravely, though, like most of us, she only
faced the situation that encompassed her. she never gazed inwards. if at
times strange images rose from the depths, she put them down to nerves.
when cecil brought the emersons to summer street, it had upset her
nerves. charlotte would burnish up past foolishness, and this might
upset her nerves. she was nervous at night. when she talked to
george--they met again almost immedia

emarked, when she returned.
â€œi promised you i shouldnâ€™t. here is your money--all shillings, except
two half-crowns. would you count it? you can settle your debt nicely
now.â€

miss bartlett was in the drawing-room, gazing at the photograph of st.
john ascending, which had been framed.

â€œhow dreadful!â€ she murmured, â€œhow more than dreadful, if mr. vyse
should come to hear of it from some other source.â€

â€œoh, no, charlotte,â€ said the girl, entering the battle. â€œgeorge emerson
is all right, and what other source is there?â€

miss bartlett considered. â€œfor instance, the driver. i saw him looking
through the bushes at you, remember he had a violet between his teeth.â€

lucy shuddered a little. â€œwe shall get the silly affair on our nerves
if we arenâ€™t careful. how could a florentine cab-driver ever get hold of
cecil?â€

â€œwe must think of every possibility.â€

â€œoh, itâ€™s all right.â€

â€œor perhaps old mr. emerson knows. in fact, he is certa

 poor opinion.â€

lucy paused. â€œcecil said one day--and i thought it so profound--that
there are two kinds of cads--the conscious and the subconscious.â€ she
paused again, to be sure of doing justice to cecilâ€™s profundity. through
the window she saw cecil himself, turning over the pages of a novel. it
was a new one from smithâ€™s library. her mother must have returned from
the station.

â€œonce a cad, always a cad,â€ droned miss bartlett.

â€œwhat i mean by subconscious is that emerson lost his head. i fell into
all those violets, and he was silly and surprised. i donâ€™t think we
ought to blame him very much. it makes such a difference when you see a
person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly. it really does;
it makes an enormous difference, and he lost his head: he doesnâ€™t admire
me, or any of that nonsense, one straw. freddy rather likes him, and
has asked him up here on sunday, so you can judge for yourself. he has
improved; he doesnâ€™t always look as

her, no nonsenseâ€--â€œanne! mary! hook me behind!â€--â€œdearest lucia, may i
trespass upon you for a pin?â€ for miss bartlett had announced that she
at all events was one for church.

the sun rose higher on its journey, guided, not by phaethon, but by
apollo, competent, unswerving, divine. its rays fell on the ladies
whenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows; on mr. beebe down
at summer street as he smiled over a letter from miss catharine alan; on
george emerson cleaning his fatherâ€™s boots; and lastly, to complete the
catalogue of memorable things, on the red book mentioned previously. the
ladies move, mr. beebe moves, george moves, and movement may engender
shadow. but this book lies motionless, to be caressed all the morning
by the sun and to raise its covers slightly, as though acknowledging the
caress.

presently lucy steps out of the drawing-room window. her new cerise
dress has been a failure, and makes her look tawdry and wan. at her

n unsatisfactory conversation. he had
said that people ought to overhaul themselves, and she did not want to
overhaul herself; she did not know it was done. honest orthodoxy
cecil respected, but he always assumed that honesty is the result of a
spiritual crisis; he could not imagine it as a natural birthright, that
might grow heavenward like flowers. all that he said on this subject
pained her, though he exuded tolerance from every pore; somehow the
emersons were different.

she saw the emersons after church. there was a line of carriages down
the road, and the honeychurch vehicle happened to be opposite cissie
villa. to save time, they walked over the green to it, and found father
and son smoking in the garden.

â€œintroduce me,â€ said her mother. â€œunless the young man considers that he
knows me already.â€

he probably did; but lucy ignored the sacred lake and introduced them
formally. old mr. emerson claimed her with much warmth, and said how
glad he was that she was g

â€œthere is a certain amount of kindness, just as there is a certain
amount of light,â€ he continued in measured tones. â€œwe cast a shadow
on something wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to
place to save things; because the shadow always follows. choose a place
where you wonâ€™t do harm--yes, choose a place where you wonâ€™t do very
much harm, and stand in it for all you are worth, facing the sunshine.â€

â€œoh, mr. emerson, i see youâ€™re clever!â€

â€œeh--?â€

â€œi see youâ€™re going to be clever. i hope you didnâ€™t go behaving like
that to poor freddy.â€

georgeâ€™s eyes laughed, and lucy suspected that he and her mother would
get on rather well.

â€œno, i didnâ€™t,â€ he said. â€œhe behaved that way to me. it is his
philosophy. only he starts life with it; and i have tried the note of
interrogation first.â€

â€œvery well, george doesnâ€™t mind tennis on sunday. no more do i. thatâ€™s
settled. mr. emerson, if you could come with your son we should be so
pleased.â€

he thanked her, but the walk sounded rather far; he could only potter
about in these days.

she turned to george: â€œand then he wants to give up his house to the
miss alans.â€

â€œi know,â€ said george, and put his arm round his fatherâ€™s neck. the
kindness that mr. beebe and lucy had always known to exist in him came
out suddenly, like sunlight touching a vast landscape--a touch of the
morning sun? she remembered tha

t a great treat for
people if his son would talk to them. â€œgeorge has been in such good
spirits today, and i am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon.â€

lucy caught her cousinâ€™s eye. something in its mute appeal made her
reckless. â€œyes,â€ she said, raising her voice, â€œi do hope he will.â€ then
she went to the carriage and murmured, â€œthe old man hasnâ€™t been told;
i knew it was all right.â€ mrs. honeychurch followed her, and they drove
away.

satisfactory that mr. emerson had not been told of the florence
escapade; yet lucyâ€™s spirits should not have leapt up as if she had
sighted the ramparts of heaven. satisfactory; yet surely she greeted
it with disproportionate joy. all the way home the horsesâ€™ hoofs sang a
tune to her: â€œhe has not told, he has not told.â€ her brain expanded the
melody: â€œhe has not told his father--to whom he tells all things. it was
not an exploit. he did not laugh at me when i had gone.â€ she raised her
hand to her cheek. â

out the words: â€œit is all right. itâ€™s a secret between
us two for ever. cecil will never hear.â€ she was even glad that miss
bartlett had made her promise secrecy, that last dark evening at
florence, when they had knelt packing in his room. the secret, big or
little, was guarded.

only three english people knew of it in the world. thus she interpreted
her joy. she greeted cecil with unusual radiance, because she felt so
safe. as he helped her out of the carriage, she said:

â€œthe emersons have been so nice. george emerson has improved
enormously.â€

â€œhow are my proteges?â€ asked cecil, who took no real interest in them,
and had long since forgotten his resolution to bring them to windy
corner for educational purposes.

â€œproteges!â€ she exclaimed with some warmth. for the only relationship
which cecil conceived was feudal: that of protector and protected. he
had no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girlâ€™s soul yearned.

â€œyou shall see for yourself

how your proteges are. george emerson is
coming up this afternoon. he is a most interesting man to talk to. only
donâ€™t--â€ she nearly said, â€œdonâ€™t protect him.â€ but the bell was ringing
for lunch, and, as often happened, cecil had paid no great attention to
her remarks. charm, not argument, was to be her forte.

lunch was a cheerful meal. generally lucy was depressed at meals. some
one had to be soothed--either cecil or miss bartlett or a being not
visible to the mortal eye--a being who whispered to her soul: â€œit

â€œnot very dutiful,â€ said her motherâ€™s voice.

fearing that she had offended cecil, she turned quickly round. there
george was. he had crept in without interrupting her.

â€œoh, i had no idea!â€ she exclaimed, getting very red; and then, without
a word of greeting, she reopened the piano. cecil should have the
parsifal, and anything else that he liked.

â€œour performer has changed her mind,â€ said miss bartlett, perhaps
implying, she will play the music to mr. emerson. lucy did not know
what to do nor even what she wanted to do. she played a few bars of the
flower maidensâ€™ song very badly and then she stopped.

â€œi vote tennis,â€ said freddy, disgusted at the scrappy entertainment.

â€œyes, so do i.â€ once more she closed the unfortunate piano. â€œi vote you
have a menâ€™s four.â€

â€œall right.â€

â€œnot for me, thank you,â€ said cecil. â€œi will not spoil the set.â€ he
never realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to

â€œdreadful!â€ said lucy, and missed her stroke. when they had finished
their set, he still went on reading; there was some murder scene, and
really everyone must listen to it. freddy and mr. floyd were obliged to
hunt for a lost ball in the laurels, but the other two acquiesced.

â€œthe scene is laid in florence.â€

â€œwhat fun, cecil! read away. come, mr. emerson, sit down after all your
energy.â€ she had â€œforgivenâ€ george, as she put it, and she made a point
of being pleasant to him.

you tired?â€

â€œof course iâ€™m not!â€

she was going to answer, â€œno,â€ when it struck her that she did mind,

cecil, this afternoon seemed such a twittering sparrow. the ups and
downs in his voice were noticeable, but they did not affect her. she had
dwelt amongst melody and movement, and her nerves refused to answer to
the clang of his. leaving him to be annoyed, she gazed at the black head
again. she did not want to stroke it, but she saw herself wanting to
stroke it; the sensation was curious.

â€œhow do you like this view of ours, mr. emerson?â€

â€œi never notice much difference in views.â€

â€œwhat do you mean?â€

â€œbecause theyâ€™re all alike. because all that matters in them is distance
and air.â€

that there is only one perfect view--the view of the sky straight over

â€œno, he isnâ€™t well.â€

â€œthereâ€™s an absurd account of a view in this book,â€ said cecil. â€œalso
that men fall into two classes--those who forget views and those who
remember them, even in small rooms.â€

â€œyou spoke of â€˜us.â€™â€

â€œmy mother, i was meaning.â€

cecil closed the novel with a bang.

â€œoh, cecil--how you made me jump!â€

â€œi will inflict joseph emery prank on you no longer.â€

â€œi can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and
seeing as far as hindhead. it is the first thing that i remember.â€

cecil got up; the man was ill-bred--he hadnâ€™t put on his coat after
tennis--he

stopped him.

â€œcecil, do read the thing about the view.â€

â€œnot while mr. emerson is here to entertain us.â€

â€œno--read away. i think nothingâ€™s funnier than to hear silly things read
out loud. if mr. emerson thinks us frivolous, he can go.â€

this struck cecil as subtle, and pleased him. it put their visitor in
the position of a prig. somewhat mollified, he sat down again.

â€œmr. emerson, go and find tennis balls.â€ she opened the book. cecil
must have his reading and anything else that he liked. but her attention
wandered to georgeâ€™s mother, who--according to mr. eager--had been
murdered in the sight of god and--according to her son--had seen as far as
hindhead.

â€œam i really to go?â€ asked george.

â€œno, of course not really,â€ she answered.

bothering you.â€

â€œwhy did you tell her, though? this is a most serious thing.â€

why does any one tell anything? the question is eternal, and it was not
surprising that miss bartlett should only sigh faintly in response. she
had done wrong--she admitted it, she only hoped that she had not done
harm; she had told eleanor in the strictest confidence.

lucy stamped with irritation.

â€œcecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to mr. emerson;
it upset mr. emerson and he insulted me again. behind cecilâ€™s back. ugh!
is it possible that men are such brutes? behind cecilâ€™s back as we were
walking up the garden.â€

miss bartlett burst into self-accusations and regrets.

â€œwhat is to be done now? can you tell me?â€

â€œoh, lucy--i shall never forgive myself, never to my dying day. fancy if
your prospects--â€

â€œi know,â€ said lucy, wincing at the word. â€œi see now why you wanted me
to tell cecil, and what you mean

whatâ€™s wanted is a man with a whip.â€

miss bartlett agreed: one wanted a man with a whip.

â€œyes--but itâ€™s no good agreeing. whatâ€™s to be done. we women go
maundering on. what does a girl do when she comes across a cad?â€

â€œi always said he was a cad, dear. give me credit for that, at all
events. from the very first moment--when he said his father was having a
bath.â€

â€œoh, bother the credit and whoâ€™s been right or wrong! weâ€™ve both made a
muddle of it. george emerson is still down the garden there, and is he
to be left unpunished, or isnâ€™t he? i want to know.â€

miss bartlett was absolutely helpless. her own exposure had unnerved
her, and thoughts were colliding painfully in her brain. she moved
feebly to the window, and tried to detect the cadâ€™s white flannels among
the laurels.

â€œyou were ready enough at the bertolini when you rushed me off to rome.

â€œwillingly would i move heaven and earth--â€

really, charlotte was outdoing herself.

â€œyes or no, please; yes or no.â€

â€œit is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle.â€ george
emerson was coming up the garden with a tennis ball in his hand.

â€œvery well,â€ said lucy, with an angry gesture. â€œno one will help me. i
will speak to him myself.â€ and immediately she realized that this was
what her cousin had intended all along.

â€œhullo, emerson!â€ called freddy from below. â€œfound the lost ball? good
man! want any tea?â€ and there was an irruption from the house on to the
terrace.

â€œoh, lucy, but that is brave of you! i admire you--â€

they had gathered round george, who beckoned, she felt, over the
rubbish, the sloppy thoughts, the furtive yearnings that were beginning
to cumber her soul. her anger faded at the sight of him. ah! the
emersons were fine people in their way. she had to subdue a rush in her
blood before s

â€œsheâ€™s started on her sunday writing. sheâ€™s in the drawing-room.â€

â€œthatâ€™s all right. you go away.â€

he went off singing.

lucy sat down at the table. miss bartlett, who was thoroughly
frightened, took up a book and pretended to read.

she would not be drawn into an elaborate speech. she just said: â€œi canâ€™t
have it, mr. emerson. i cannot even talk to you. go out of this house,
and never come into it again as long as i live here--â€ flushing as she
spoke and pointing to the door. â€œi hate a row. go please.â€

â€œwhat--â€

â€œno discussion.â€

â€œbut i canâ€™t--â€

she shook her head. â€œgo, please. i do not want to call in mr. vyse.â€

mean that you are going to marry that man?â€

the line was unexpected.

because the book made me do that, and i wish to goodness i had more

you, and you may not have noticed that i love you. or would you have
told me to go, and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly? but

lucy thought of a very good remark.

â€œyou say mr. vyse wants me to listen to him, mr. emerson. pardon me for
suggesting that you have caught the habit.â€

and he took the shoddy reproof and touched it into immortality. he said:

â€œyes, i have,â€ and sank down as if suddenly weary. â€œiâ€™m the same kind of
brute at bottom. this desire to govern a woman--it lies very deep, and
men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden.

seized her, and she was aware of autumn.
summer was ending, and the evening brought her odours of decay, the
more pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring. that something or
other mattered intellectually? a leaf, violently agitated, danced past
her, while other leaves lay motionless. that the earth was hastening to
re-enter darkness, and the shadows of those trees over windy corner?

â€œhullo, lucy! thereâ€™s still light enough for another set, if you twoâ€™ll
hurry.â€

â€œmr. emerson has had to go.â€

â€œwhat a nuisance! that spoils the four. i say, cecil, do play, do,
thereâ€™s a good chap. itâ€™s floydâ€™s last day. do play tennis with us, just
this once.â€

cecilâ€™s voice came: â€œmy dear freddy, i am no athlete. as you well
remarked this very morning, â€˜there are some chaps who are no good for
anything but booksâ€™; i plead guilty to being such a chap, and will not
inflict myself on you.â€

the scales fell from lucyâ€™s eyes. how had she stood cecil for

so she did want to talk about her broken engagement. always complaisant,
he put the letter away. but she, at once exclaimed in a high voice, â€œoh,
do tell me more about the miss alans! how perfectly splendid of them to
go abroad!â€

â€œi want them to start from venice, and go in a cargo steamer down the
illyrian coast!â€

she laughed heartily. â€œoh, delightful! i wish theyâ€™d take me.â€

â€œhas italy filled you with the fever of travel? perhaps george emerson
is right. he says that â€˜italy is only an euphuism for fate.â€™â€

â€œoh, not italy, but constantinople. i have always longed to go to
constantinople. constantinople is practically asia, isnâ€™t it?â€

mr. beebe reminded her that constantinople was still unlikely, and that
the miss alans only aimed at athens, â€œwith delphi, perhaps, if the roads
are safe.â€ but this made no difference to her enthusiasm. she had always
longed to go to greece even more, it seemed. he saw, to his sur

rtance that they attach to words. a rector lives in a web of petty
secrets, and confidences and warnings, and the wiser he is the less he
will regard them. he will change the subject, as did mr. beebe, saying
cheerfully: â€œhave you heard from any bertolini people lately? i believe
you keep up with miss lavish. it is odd how we of that pension,
who seemed such a fortuitous collection, have been working into one
anotherâ€™s lives. two, three, four, six of us--no, eight; i had forgotten
the emersons--have kept more or less in touch. we must really give the
signora a testimonial.â€

and, miss bartlett not favouring the scheme, they walked up the hill in
a silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern. on the
summit they paused. the sky had grown wilder since he stood there last
hour, giving to the land a tragic greatness that is rare in surrey.
grey clouds were charging across tissues of white, which stretched and
shredded and tore slowly, until through their final

danger until she could confirm her resolution of virginity. the
feeling was very subtle and quite undogmatic, and he never imparted it
to any other of the characters in this entanglement. yet it existed,
and it alone explains his action subsequently, and his influence on the
action of others. the compact that he made with miss bartlett in the
tavern, was to help not only lucy, but religion also.

they hurried home through a world of black and grey. he conversed on
indifferent topics: the emersonsâ€™ need of a housekeeper; servants;
italian servants; novels about italy; novels with a purpose; could
literature influence life? windy corner glimmered. in the garden, mrs.
honeychurch, now helped by freddy, still wrestled with the lives of her
flowers.

â€œit gets too dark,â€ she said hopelessly. â€œthis comes of putting off. we
might have known the weather would break up soon; and now lucy wants to
go to greece. i donâ€™t know what the worldâ€™s coming to.â€

perhaps the song stated â€œthe better partâ€ rather too strongly. he half
fancied that the soaring accompaniment--which he did not lose in the
shout of the gale--really agreed with freddy, and was gently criticizing
the words that it adorned:

  â€œvacant heart and hand and eye
   easy live and quiet die.â€

however, for the fourth time windy corner lay poised below him--now as a
beacon in the roaring tides of darkness.



chapter xix: lying to mr. emerson

the miss alans were found in their beloved temperance hotel near
bloomsbury--a clean, airless establishment much patronized by provincial
england. they always perched there before crossing the great seas,
and for a week or two would fidget gently over clothes, guide-books,
mackintosh squares, digestive bread, and other continental necessaries.
that there are shops abroad, even in athens, never occurred to them, for
they regarded travel as a species of warfare, only to be undertaken

œyou know, lucy, you and charlotte and mr. beebe all tell me iâ€™m
so stupid, so i suppose i am, but i shall never understand this
hole-and-corner work. youâ€™ve got rid of cecil--well and good, and iâ€™m
thankful heâ€™s gone, though i did feel angry for the minute. but why not
announce it? why this hushing up and tip-toeing?â€

â€œitâ€™s only for a few days.â€

â€œbut why at all?â€

lucy was silent. she was drifting away from her mother. it was quite
easy to say, â€œbecause george emerson has been bothering me, and if he
hears iâ€™ve given up cecil may begin againâ€--quite easy, and it had
the incidental advantage of being true. but she could not say it. she
disliked confidences, for they might lead to self-knowledge and to that
king of terrors--light. ever since that last evening at florence she had
deemed it unwise to reveal her soul.

mrs. honeychurch, too, was silent. she was thinking, â€œmy daughter wonâ€™t
answer me; she would rather be with those inquisitive old

he fancied she saw a padlock.

â€œis that house to let again, powell?â€ she called.

â€œyes, miss,â€ he replied.

â€œhave they gone?â€

â€œit is too far out of town for the young gentleman, and his fatherâ€™s
rheumatism has come on, so he canâ€™t stop on alone, so they are trying to
let furnished,â€ was the answer.

â€œthey have gone, then?â€

â€œyes, miss, they have gone.â€

lucy sank back. the carriage stopped at the rectory. she got out to call
for miss bartlett. so the emersons had gone, and all this bother about
greece had been unnecessary. waste! that word seemed to sum up the whole
of life. wasted plans, wasted money, wasted love, and she had wounded
her mother. was it possible that she had muddled things away? quite
possible. other people had. when the maid opened the door, she was
unable to speak, and stared stupidly into the hall.

miss bartlett at once came forward, and after a long preamble asked
a great favour: might she go to church? mr. beebe and h

 church, built upon the slope of the hill
so artfully, with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of silvery
shingle--even their church had lost its charm; and the thing one never
talked about--religion--was fading like all the other things.

she followed the maid into the rectory.

would she object to sitting in mr. beebeâ€™s study? there was only that
one fire.

she would not object.

some one was there already, for lucy heard the words: â€œa lady to wait,
sir.â€

old mr. emerson was sitting by the fire, with his foot upon a
gout-stool.

â€œoh, miss honeychurch, that you should come!â€ he quavered; and lucy saw
an alteration in him since last sunday.

not a word would come to her lips. george she had faced, and could have
faced again, but she had forgotten how to treat his father.

â€œmiss honeychurch, dear, we are so sorry! george is so sorry! he thought
he had a right to try. i cannot blame my boy, and yet i wish he had told
me first. he ought not to have

â€œâ€˜abominableâ€™ is much too strong. i am sorry i used it about your son. i
think i will go to church, after all. my mother and my cousin have gone.
i shall not be so very late--â€

â€œespecially as he has gone under,â€ he said quietly.

â€œwhat was that?â€

â€œgone under naturally.â€ he beat his palms together in silence; his head
fell on his chest.

â€œi donâ€™t understand.â€

â€œas his mother did.â€

â€œbut, mr. emerson--mr. emerson--what are you talking about?â€

â€œwhen i wouldnâ€™t have george baptized,â€ said he.

lucy was frightened.

â€œand she agreed that baptism was nothing, but he caught that fever
when he was twelve and she turned round. she thought it a judgement.â€ he
shuddered. â€œoh, horrible, when we had given up that sort of thing and
broken away from her parents. oh, horrible--worst of all--worse than
death, when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness, planted

we slip back into the darkness for ever?â€

â€œi donâ€™t know,â€ gasped lucy. â€œi donâ€™t understand this sort of thing. i
was not meant to understand it.â€

â€œbut mr. eager--he came when i was out, and acted according to his
principles. i donâ€™t blame him or any one... but by the time george
was well she was ill. he made her think about sin, and she went under
thinking about it.â€

it was thus that mr. emerson had murdered his wife in the sight of god.

â€œoh, how terrible!â€ said lucy, forgetting her own affairs at last.

â€œhe was not baptized,â€ said the old man. â€œi did hold firm.â€ and he
looked with unwavering eyes at the rows of books, as if--at what
cost!--he had won a victory over them. â€œmy boy shall go back to the
earth untouched.â€

she asked whether young mr. emerson was ill.

â€œoh--last sunday.â€ he started into the present. â€œgeorge last sunday--no,
not ill: just g

â€œi am so sorry, but it is no good discussing this affair. i am deeply

â€œthen there came something about a novel. i didnâ€™t follow it at all; i
had to hear so much, and he minded telling me; he finds me too old. ah,
well, one must have failures. george comes down to-morrow, and takes me
up to his london rooms. he canâ€™t bear to be about here, and i must be
where he is.â€

â€œmr. emerson,â€ cried the girl, â€œdonâ€™t leave at least, not on my account.
i am going to greece. donâ€™t leave your comfortable house.â€

it was the first time her voice had been kind and he smiled. â€œhow good
everyone is! and look at mr. beebe housing me--came over this morning
and heard i was going! here i am so comfortable with a fire.â€

â€œyes, but you wonâ€™t go back to london. itâ€™s absurd.â€

not justifying him: i am only saying what has happened.â€

bother enough to the world by now. i canâ€™t have you moving out of your
house when you like it, and perhaps losing money through it--all on my
account. you must stop! i am just going to greece.â€

â€œall the way to greece?â€

her manner altered.

â€œto greece?â€

â€œso you must stop. you wonâ€™t talk about this business, i know. i can
trust you both.â€

â€œcertainly you can. we either have you in our lives, or leave

â€œi suppose mr. vyse is very angry with george? no, it was wrong of
george to try. we have pushed our beliefs too far. i fancy that we
deserve sorrow.â€

she looked at the books again--black, brown, and that acrid theological
blue. they surrounded the visitors on every side; they were piled on the
tables, they pressed against the very ceiling. to lucy who could not see
that mr. emerson was profoundly religious, and differed from mr. beebe
chiefly by his acknowledgment of passion--it seemed dreadful that the
old man should crawl into such a sanctum, when he was unhappy, and be
dependent on the bounty of a clergyman.

more certain than ever that she was tired, he offered her his chair.

â€œno, please sit still. i think i will sit in the carriage.â€

â€œmiss honeychurch, you do sound tired.â€

â€œnot a bit,â€ said lucy, with trembling lips.

which consists of your cousin, your mother, and my mother, stands

â€œno--of course, iâ€™ll see. how are the miss alans?â€

â€œvery well, thank you.â€

â€œdid you tell mr. emerson about greece?â€

â€œdonâ€™t you think it very plucky of her, mr. emerson, to undertake the

stables.

â€œhe is not going,â€ she said hoarsely. â€œi made a slip. mr. vyse does stop

â€œi was saying, why should you trust her when she deceived you?â€

â€œlucy! lucy!â€ called voices from the carriage.

â€œmr. beebe, could you help me?â€

he looked amazed at the request, and said in a low, stern voice: â€œi
am more grieved than i can possibly express. it is lamentable,
lamentable--incredible.â€

â€œwhatâ€™s wrong with the boy?â€ fired up the other again.

â€œnothing, mr. emerson, except that he no longer interests me. marry
george, miss honeychurch. he will do admirably.â€

he walked out and left them. they heard him guiding his mother
up-stairs.

â€œlucy!â€ the voices called.

she turned to mr. emerson in despair. but his face revived her. it was
the face of a saint who understood.

â€œnow it is all dark. now beauty and passion seem never to have existed.
