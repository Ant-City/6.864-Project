    to cavil in the course of this contract.
    if once it be neglected, ten to one
    we shall not find like opportunity.

    to save your subjects from such massacre
    and ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
    by our proceeding in hostility;
    and therefore take this compact of a truce,

    in any of our towns of garrison.
