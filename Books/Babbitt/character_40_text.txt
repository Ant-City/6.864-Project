e the guests had come, including the inevitable late couple
for whom the others waited with painful amiability, a great gray
emptiness had replaced the purple swirling in babbitt's head, and he had
to force the tumultuous greetings suitable to a host on floral heights.

the guests were howard littlefield, the doctor of philosophy who
furnished publicity and comforting economics to the street traction
company; vergil gunch, the coal-dealer, equally powerful in the elks
and in the boosters' club; eddie swanson the agent for the javelin motor
car, who lived across the street; and orville jones, owner of the lily
white laundry, which justly announced itself "the biggest, busiest,
bulliest cleanerie shoppe in zenith." but, naturally, the most
distinguished of all was t. cholmondeley frink, who was not only the
author of "poemulations," which, syndicated daily in sixty-seven leading
newspapers, gave him one of the largest audiences of any poet in the
world, but also an optimistic lecturer and the creator

hum."

with them were six wives, more or less--it was hard to tell, so early in
the evening, as at first glance they all looked alike, and as they all
said, "oh, isn't this nice!" in the same tone of determined liveliness.
to the eye, the men were less similar: littlefield, a hedge-scholar,
tall and horse-faced; chum frink, a trifle of a man with soft and
mouse-like hair, advertising his profession as poet by a silk cord on
his eye-glasses; vergil gunch, broad, with coarse black hair en brosse;
eddie swanson, a bald and bouncing young man who showed his taste
for elegance by an evening waistcoat of figured black silk with glass
buttons; orville jones, a steady-looking, stubby, not very memorable
person, with a hemp-colored toothbrush mustache. yet they were all so
well fed and clean, they all shouted "'evenin', georgie!" with such
robustness, that they seemed to be cousins, and the strange thing is
that the longer one knew the women, the less alike they seemed;
while the longer one knew the men, th

if i'd been running the thing, i'd have arranged it so that the drinker
himself was licensed, and then we could have taken care of the shiftless
workman--kept him from drinking--and yet not 've interfered with the
rights--with the personal liberty--of fellows like ourselves."

they bobbed their heads, looked admiringly at one another, and stated,
"that's so, that would be the stunt."

"the thing that worries me is that a lot of these guys will take to
cocaine," sighed eddie swanson.

they bobbed more violently, and groaned, "that's so, there is a danger
of that."

chum frink chanted, "oh, say, i got hold of a swell new receipt for
home-made beer the other day. you take--"

gunch interrupted, "wait! let me tell you mine!" littlefield snorted,
"beer! rats! thing to do is to ferment cider!" jones insisted, "i've
got the receipt that does the business!" swanson begged, "oh, say, lemme
tell you the story--" but frink went on resolutely, "you take and save
the shells from peas,

whole thing about prohibition is this: it isn't the initial
cost, it's the humidity."

not till the one required topic had been dealt with did the conversation
become general.

it was often and admiringly said of vergil gunch, "gee, that fellow can
get away with murder! why, he can pull a raw one in mixed company and
all the ladies 'll laugh their heads off, but me, gosh, if i crack
anything that's just the least bit off color i get the razz for fair!"
now gunch delighted them by crying to mrs. eddie swanson, youngest
of the women, "louetta! i managed to pinch eddie's doorkey out of his
pocket, and what say you and me sneak across the street when the folks
aren't looking? got something," with a gorgeous leer, "awful important
to tell you!"

the women wriggled, and babbitt was stirred to like naughtiness. "say,
folks, i wished i dared show you a book i borrowed from doc patten!"

"now, george! the idea!" mrs. babbitt warned him.

"this book--racy isn't the word! it's some kind of an anthropological

it's a book you can't buy. verg, i'll lend it to you."

"me first!" insisted eddie swanson. "sounds spicy!"

orville jones announced, "say, i heard a good one the other day about
a coupla swedes and their wives," and, in the best jewish accent, he
resolutely carried the good one to a slightly disinfected ending.
gunch capped it. but the cocktails waned, the seekers dropped back into
cautious reality.

chum frink had recently been on a lecture-tour among the small towns,
and he chuckled, "awful good to get back to civilization! i certainly
been seeing some hick towns! i mean--course t

and so balled-up in their thinking!"

orville jones commented, "and, then take our other advantages--the
movies, frinstance. these yapville sports think they're all-get-out if
they have one change of bill a week, where here in the city you got your
choice of a dozen diff'rent movies any evening you want to name!"

"sure, and the inspiration we get from rubbing up against high-class
hustlers every day and getting jam full of ginger," said eddie swanson.

prince albert is john-on-the-job--always joy'usly more-ish in flavor;

ning money, that they were not
adequately supported. they worked perhaps two hours a day, and the
rest of the time they ate chocolates, went to the motion-pictures, went
window-shopping, went in gossiping twos and threes to card-parties,
read magazines, thought timorously of the lovers who never appeared,
and accumulated a splendid restlessness which they got rid of by nagging
their husbands. the husbands nagged back.

of these naggers the swansons were perfect specimens.

throughout the dinner eddie swanson had been complaining, publicly,
about his wife's new frock. it was, he submitted, too short, too low,
too immodestly thin, and much too expensive. he appealed to babbitt:

"honest, george, what do you think of that rag louetta went and bought?
don't you think it's the limit?"

"what's eating you, eddie? i call it a swell little dress."

"oh, it is, mr. swanson. it's a sweet frock," mrs. babbitt protested.

"there now, do you see, smarty! you're such an authority on clothes!"

mrs orville jones begged, "oh, let's talk to dante! we studied him at
the reading circle. you know who he was, orvy."

"certainly i know who he was! the wop poet. where do you think i was
raised?" from her insulted husband.

"sure--the fellow that took the cook's tour to hell. i've never waded
through his po'try, but we learned about him in the u.," said babbitt.

"page mr. dannnnnty!" intoned eddie swanson.

"you ought to get him easy, mr. frink, you and he being fellow-poets,"
said louetta swanson.

"fellow-poets, rats! where d' you get that stuff?" protested vergil
gunch. "i suppose dante showed a lot of speed for an old-timer--not that
i've actually read him, of course--but to come right down to hard facts,
he wouldn't stand one-two-three if he had to buckle down to practical
literature and turn out a poem for the newspaper-syndicate every day,
like chum does!"

cal research had started them off again.
("why didn't they go home! why didn't they go home!") though he
was impressed by the profundity of the statement, he was only
half-enthusiastic when howard littlefield lectured, "the united states
is the only nation in which the government is a moral ideal and not just
a social arrangement." ("true--true--weren't they ever going home?") he
was usually delighted to have an "inside view" of the momentous world of
motors but to-night he scarcely listened to eddie swanson's revelation:
"if you want to go above the javelin class, the zeeco is a mighty good
buy. couple weeks ago, and mind you, this was a fair, square test, they
took a zeeco stock touring-car and they slid up the tonawanda hill on
high, and fellow told me--" ("zeeco good boat but--were they planning to
stay all night?")

they really were going, with a flutter of "we did have the best time!"

most aggressively friendly of all was babbitt, yet as he burbled he was
reflecting, "i got through it, but f

 and the days were blank of face
and silent.

in june, mrs. babbitt and tinka went east, to stay with relatives, and
babbitt was free to do--he was not quite sure what.

all day long after their departure he thought of the emancipated house
in which he could, if he desired, go mad and curse the gods without
having to keep up a husbandly front. he considered, "i could have a
reg'lar party to-night; stay out till two and not do any explaining
afterwards. cheers!" he telephoned to vergil gunch, to eddie swanson.
both of them were engaged for the evening, and suddenly he was bored by
having to take so much trouble to be riotous.

he was silent at dinner, unusually kindly to ted and verona, hesitating
but not disapproving when verona stated her opinion of kenneth escott's
opinion of dr. john jennison drew's opinion of the opinions of the
evolutionists. ted was working in a garage through the summer vacation,
and he related his daily triumphs: how he had found a cracked ball-race,

she was gone. babbitt utterly repudiated the view that he had been
trying to discover how approachable was miss mcgoun. "course! knew there

eddie swanson, the motor-car agent who lived across the street from
babbitt, was giving a sunday supper. his wife louetta, young louetta who
loved jazz in music and in clothes and laughter, was at her wildest. she
cried, "we'll have a real party!" as she received the guests. babbitt
had uneasily felt that to many men she might be alluring; now he
admitted that to himself she was overwhelmingly alluring. mrs. babbitt
had never quite approved of louetta; babbitt was glad that she was not
here this evening.

he

 insisted on helping louetta in the kitchen: taking the chicken
croquettes from the warming-oven, the lettuce sandwiches from the
ice-box. he held her hand, once, and she depressingly didn't notice it.
she caroled, "you're a good little mother's-helper, georgie. now trot in
with the tray and leave it on the side-table."

he wished that eddie swanson would give them cocktails; that louetta
would have one. he wanted--oh, he wanted to be one of these bohemians
you read about. studio parties. wild lovely girls who were independent.
not necessarily bad. certainly not! but not tame, like floral heights.
how he'd ever stood it all these years--

eddie did not give them cocktails. true, they supped with mirth, and
with several repetitions by orville jones of "any time louetta wants to
come sit on my lap i'll tell this sandwich to beat it!" but the

ednesday, while he hoped that she would hurry up
and finish her description of the plot, the beauty of the leading man,
and the luxury of the setting, he studied her. slim waist girdled
with raw silk, strong brows, ardent eyes, hair parted above a broad
forehead--she meant youth to him and a charm which saddened. he thought
of how valiant a companion she would be on a long motor tour, exploring
mountains, picnicking in a pine grove high above a valley. her frailness
touched him; he was angry at eddie swanson for the incessant family
bickering. all at once he identified louetta with the fairy girl. he
was startled by the conviction that they had always had a romantic
attraction for each other.

"i suppose you're leading a simply terrible life, now you're a widower,"
she said.

"you bet! i'm a bad little fellow and proud of it. some evening you slip
eddie some dope in his coffee and sneak across the road and i'll show
you how to mix a cocktail," he roared.

"well, now, i might do it! you never can te

ll!"

"well, whenever you're ready, you just hang a towel out of the attic
window and i'll jump for the gin!"

every one giggled at this naughtiness. in a pleased way eddie swanson
stated that he would have a physician analyze his coffee daily. the
others were diverted to a discussion of the more agreeable recent
murders, but babbitt drew louetta back to personal things:

"that's the prettiest dress i ever saw in my life."

"do you honestly like it?"

"like it? why, say, i'm going to have kenneth escott put a piece in the
paper saying that the swellest dressed woman in the u. s. is mrs. e.
louetta swanson."

"now, you stop teasing me!" but she beamed. "let's dance a littl
