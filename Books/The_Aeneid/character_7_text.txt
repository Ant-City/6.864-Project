he rivals lov'd, and how they fought.
  these are my theme, and how the war began,
  and how concluded by the godlike man:
  for i shall sing of battles, blood, and rage,
  which princes and their people did engage;
  and haughty souls, that, mov'd with mutual hate,
  in fighting fields pursued and found their fate;
  that rous'd the tyrrhene realm with loud alarms,
  and peaceful italy involv'd in arms.
  a larger scene of action is display'd;
  and, rising hence, a greater work is weigh'd.

  latinus, old and mild, had long possess'd
  the latin scepter, and his people blest:
  his father faunus; a laurentian dame
  his mother; fair marica was her name.
  but faunus came from picus: picus drew
  his birth from saturn, if records be true.
  thus king latinus, in the third degree,
  had saturn author of his family.
  but this old peaceful prince, as heav'n decreed,
  was blest with no male issue to succeed:
  his sons in blooming youth were snatch'd by fate;
  one only daughter heir'd the roy

  among the crowd, but far above the rest,
  young turnus to the beauteous maid address'd.
  turnus, for high descent and graceful mien,
  was first, and favor'd by the latian queen;
  with him she strove to join lavinia's hand,
  but dire portents the purpos'd match withstand.

  deep in the palace, of long growth, there stood
  a laurel's trunk, a venerable wood;
  where rites divine were paid; whose holy hair
  was kept and cut with superstitious care.
  this plant latinus, when his town he wall'd,
  then found, and from the tree laurentum call'd;
  and last, in honor of his new abode,
  he vow'd the laurel to the laurel's god.
  it happen'd once (a boding prodigy!)
  a swarm of bees, that cut the liquid sky,
  (unknown from whence they took their airy flight,)
  upon the topmost branch in clouds alight;
  there with their clasping feet together clung,
  and a long cluster from the laurel hung.
  an ancient augur prophesied from hence:
  "behold on latian shores

, from the sacred altar broke,
  caught her dishevel'd hair and rich attire;
  her crown and jewels crackled in the fire:
  from thence the fuming trail began to spread
  and lambent glories danc'd about her head.
  this new portent the seer with wonder views,
  then pausing, thus his prophecy renews:
  "the nymph, who scatters flaming fires around,
  shall shine with honor, shall herself be crown'd;
  but, caus'd by her irrevocable fate,
  war shall the country waste, and change the state."

  latinus, frighted with this dire ostent,
  for counsel to his father faunus went,
  and sought the shades renown'd for prophecy
  which near albunea's sulph'rous fountain lie.
  to these the latian and the sabine land
  fly, when distress'd, and thence relief demand.
  the priest on skins of off'rings takes his ease,
  and nightly visions in his slumber sees;
  a swarm of thin aerial shapes appears,
  and, flutt'ring round his temples, deafs his ears:
  these he consults, the future fates to know,

om pow'rs above, and from the fiends below.
  here, for the gods' advice, latinus flies,
  off'ring a hundred sheep for sacrifice:
  their woolly fleeces, as the rites requir'd,
  he laid beneath him, and to rest retir'd.
  no sooner were his eyes in slumber bound,
  when, from above, a more than mortal sound
  invades his ears; and thus the vision spoke:
  "seek not, my seed, in latian bands to yoke
  our fair lavinia, nor the gods provoke.
  a foreign son upon thy shore descends,
  whose martial fame from pole to pole extends.

  girt in his gabin gown the hero sate,
  yet could not with his art avoid his fate:
  for circe long had lov'd the youth in vain,
  till love, refus'd, converted to disdain:
  then, mixing pow'rful herbs, with magic art,
  she chang'd his form, who could not change his heart;
  constrain'd him in a bird, and made him fly,
  with party-color'd plumes, a chatt'ring pie.

  in this high temple, on a chair of state,
  the seat of audience, old latinus sate;
  then gave admission to the trojan train;
  and thus with pleasing accents he began:
  "tell me, ye trojans, for that name you own,
  nor is your course upon our coasts unknown-
  say what you seek, and whither were you bound:
  were you by stress of weather cast aground?
  (such dangers as on seas are often seen,
  and oft befall to miserable men,)
  or come, your shipping in our ports to lay,
  spent and disabled in so long a way?

  where tuscan tiber rolls with rapid force,
  and where numicus opes his holy source.
  besides, our prince presents, with his request,
  some small remains of what his sire possess'd.
  this golden charger, snatch'd from burning troy,
  anchises did in sacrifice employ;
  this royal robe and this tiara wore
  old priam, and this golden scepter bore
  in full assemblies, and in solemn games;
  these purple vests were weav'd by dardan dames."

  thus while he spoke, latinus roll'd around
  his eyes, and fix'd a while upon the ground.
  intent he seem'd, and anxious in his breast;
  not by the scepter mov'd, or kingly vest,
  but pond'ring future things of wondrous weight;
  succession, empire, and his daughter's fate.
  on these he mus'd within his thoughtful mind,
  and then revolv'd what faunus had divin'd.
  this was the foreign prince, by fate decreed
  to share his scepter, and lavinia's bed;
  this was the race that sure portents foreshew

  to mount the trojan troop. at his command
  the steeds caparison'd with purple stand,
  with golden trappings, glorious to behold,
  and champ betwixt their teeth the foaming gold.
  then to his absent guest the king decreed
  a pair of coursers born of heav'nly breed,
  who from their nostrils breath'd ethereal fire;
  whom circe stole from her celestial sire,
  by substituting mares produc'd on earth,
  whose wombs conceiv'd a more than mortal birth.
  these draw the chariot which latinus sends,
  and the rich present to the prince commends.
  sublime on stately steeds the trojans borne,
  to their expecting lord with peace return.

  but jealous juno, from pachynus' height,
  as she from argos took her airy flight,
  beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight.
  she saw the trojan and his joyful train
  descend upon the shore, desert the main,
  design a town, and, with unhop'd success,
  th' embassadors return with promis'd peace.
  then, pierc'd with pain, she shook her haug

spur their smoking steeds to cross their way,
  and watch each entrance of the winding wood.
  black was the forest: thick with beech it stood,
  horrid with fern, and intricate with thorn;
  few paths of human feet, or tracks of beasts, were worn.
  the darkness of the shades, his heavy prey,
  and fear, misled the younger from his way.
  but nisus hit the turns with happier haste,
  and, thoughtless of his friend, the forest pass'd,
  and alban plains, from alba's name so call'd,
  where king latinus then his oxen stall'd;
  till, turning at the length, he stood his ground,
  and miss'd his friend, and cast his eyes around:
  "ah wretch!" he cried, "where have i left behind
  th' unhappy youth? where shall i hope to find?
  or what way take?" again he ventures back,
  and treads the mazes of his former track.
  he winds the wood, and, list'ning, hears the noise
  of tramping coursers, and the riders' voice.

  his former acts secure his present fame,
  and the queen shades him with her mighty name.

  while thus their factious minds with fury burn,
  the legates from th' aetolian prince return:
  sad news they bring, that, after all the cost
  and care employ'd, their embassy is lost;
  that diomedes refus'd his aid in war,
  unmov'd with presents, and as deaf to pray'r.
  some new alliance must elsewhere be sought,
  or peace with troy on hard conditions bought.

  latinus, sunk in sorrow, finds too late,
  a foreign son is pointed out by fate;
  and, till aeneas shall lavinia wed,
  the wrath of heav'n is hov'ring o'er his head.
  the gods, he saw, espous'd the juster side,
  when late their titles in the field were tried:
  witness the fresh laments, and fun'ral tears undried.
  thus, full of anxious thought, he summons all
  the latian senate to the council hall.
  the princes come, commanded by their head,
  and crowd the paths that to the palace lead.

  he said, and, turning short, with speedy pace,
  casts back a scornful glance, and quits the place:
  "thou, volusus, the volscian troops command
  to mount; and lead thyself our ardean band.
  messapus and catillus, post your force
  along the fields, to charge the trojan horse.
  some guard the passes, others man the wall;
  drawn up in arms, the rest attend my call."

  they swarm from ev'ry quarter of the town,
  and with disorder'd haste the rampires crown.
  good old latinus, when he saw, too late,
  the gath'ring storm just breaking on the state,
  dismiss'd the council till a fitter time,
  and own'd his easy temper as his crime,
  who, forc'd against his reason, had complied
  to break the treaty for the promis'd bride.

  some help to sink new trenches; others aid
  to ram the stones, or raise the palisade.
  hoarse trumpets sound th' alarm; around the walls
  runs a distracted crew, whom their last labor calls.

  but now the queen, who fear'd for turnus' life,
  and loath'd the hard conditions of the strife,
  held him by force; and, dying in his death,
  in these sad accents gave her sorrow breath:
  "o turnus, i adjure thee by these tears,
  and whate'er price amata's honor bears
  within thy breast, since thou art all my hope,
  my sickly mind's repose, my sinking age's prop;
  since on the safety of thy life alone
  depends latinus, and the latian throne:
  refuse me not this one, this only pray'r,
  to waive the combat, and pursue the war.
  whatever chance attends this fatal strife,
  think it includes, in thine, amata's life.
  i cannot live a slave, or see my throne
  usurp'd by strangers or a trojan son."

  at this, a flood of tears lavinia shed;
  a crimson blush her beauteous face o'erspread,
  varying her cheeks by turns with white and red.
  the driving colors, never at a stay,
  run here and there, and flush, a

  thrice tore her hair, and beat her comely breast.
  to whom saturnia thus: "thy tears are late:
  haste, snatch him, if he can be snatch'd from fate:
  new tumults kindle; violate the truce:
  who knows what changeful fortune may produce?
  't is not a crime t' attempt what i decree;
  or, if it were, discharge the crime on me."
  she said, and, sailing on the winged wind,
  left the sad nymph suspended in her mind.

  and now pomp the peaceful kings appear:
  four steeds the chariot of latinus bear;
  twelve golden beams around his temples play,
  to mark his lineage from the god of day.
  two snowy coursers turnus' chariot yoke,
  and in his hand two massy spears he shook:
  then issued from the camp, in arms divine,
  aeneas, author of the roman line;
  and by his side ascanius took his place,
  the second hope of rome's immortal race.

  ascanius shall renounce th' ausonian crown:
  all claims, all questions of debate, shall cease;
  nor he, nor they, with force infringe the peace.
  but, if my juster arms prevail in fight,
  (as sure they shall, if i divine aright,)
  my trojans shall not o'er th' italians reign:
  both equal, both unconquer'd shall remain,

  and bless the rising tow'rs with fair lavinia's name."

  thus he. then, with erected eyes and hands,
  the latian king before his altar stands.
  "by the same heav'n," said he, "and earth, and main,
  and all the pow'rs that all the three contain;

  the trojans, tuscans, and arcadian line,
  with equal courage obviate their design.
  peace leaves the violated fields, and hate
  both armies urges to their mutual fate.
  with impious haste their altars are o'erturn'd,
  the sacrifice half-broil'd, and half-unburn'd.
  thick storms of steel from either army fly,
  and clouds of clashing darts obscure the sky;
  brands from the fire are missive weapons made,
  with chargers, bowls, and all the priestly trade.
  latinus, frighted, hastens from the fray,
  and bears his unregarded gods away.
  these on their horses vault; those yoke the car;
  the rest, with swords on high, run headlong to the war.

  messapus, eager to confound the peace,
  spurr'd his hot courser thro' the fighting prease,
  at king aulestes, by his purple known
  a tuscan prince, and by his regal crown;
  and, with a shock encount'ring, bore him down.
  backward he fell; and, as his fate design'd,
  the ruins of an altar were behind:

with both her hands her purple vest:
  then round a beam a running noose she tied,
  and, fasten'd by the neck, obscenely died.

  soon as the fatal news by fame was blown,
  and to her dames and to her daughter known,
  the sad lavinia rends her yellow hair
  and rosy cheeks; the rest her sorrow share:
  with shrieks the palace rings, and madness of despair.
  the spreading rumor fills the public place:
  confusion, fear, distraction, and disgrace,
  and silent shame, are seen in ev'ry face.
  latinus tears his garments as he goes,
  both for his public and his private woes;
  with filth his venerable beard besmears,
  and sordid dust deforms his silver hairs.
  and much he blames the softness of his mind,
  obnoxious to the charms of womankind,
  and soon seduc'd to change what he so well design'd;
  to break the solemn league so long desir'd,
  nor finish what his fates, and those of troy, requir'd.

  now turnus rolls aloof o'er empty plains,
  and here and there some straggling foes he g
