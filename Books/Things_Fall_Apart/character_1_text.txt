n, it could
also mean a man who had taken no title. and so okonkwo was
ruled by one passion - to hate everything that his father unoka had
loved. one of those things was gentleness and another was idleness.

during the planting season okonkwo worked daily on his farms
from cock-crow until the chickens went to roost. he was a very
strong man and rarely felt fatigue. but his wives and young
children were not as strong, and so they suffered. but they dared
not complain openly. okonkwo's first son, nwoye, was then



twelve years old but was already causing his father great anxiety
for his incipient laziness. at any rate, that was how it looked to his
father, and he sought to correct him by constant nagging and
beating. and so nwoye was developing into a sad-faced youth.



okonkwo's prosperity was visible in his household. he had a large
compound enclosed by a thick wall of red earth. his own hut, or
obi, stood immediately behind the only gate in the red walls. each
of his three wives had her

three wives and eight children.

so when the daughter of umuofia was killed in mbaino,
ikemefuna came into okonkwo's household. when okonkwo
brought him home that day he called his most senior wife and
handed him over to her.

"he belongs to the clan," he told her. "so look after him."

"is he staying long with us?" she asked.

"do what you are told, woman," okonkwo thundered, and
stammered. "when did you become one of the ndichie of
umuofia?"

and so nwoye's mother took ikemefuna to her hut and asked no
more questions.





as for the boy himself, he was terribly afraid. he could not
understand what was happening to him or what he had done. how
could he know that his father had taken a hand in killing a daughter
of umuofia? all he knew was that a few men had arrived at their
house, conversing with his father in low tones, and at the end he
had been taken out and handed over to a stranger. his mother had
wept bitterly, but he had been too surpris

a king and brought him a virgin who was given to udo as wife, and
the lad ikemefuna.

the elders of the clan had decided that ikemefuna should be in
okonkwo's care for a while. but no one thought it would be as
long as three years. they seemed to forget all about him as soon as
they had taken the decision.

at first ikemefuna was very much afraid. once or twice he tried to
run away, but he did not know where to begin. he thought of his
mother and his three-year-old sister and wept bitterly. nwoye's
mother was very kind to him and treated him as one of her own
children. but all he said was: "when shall i go home?" when
okonkwo heard that he would not eat any food he came into the
hut with a big stick in his hand and stood over him while he
swallowed his yams, trembling. a few moments later he went
behind the hut and began to vomit painfully. nwoye's mother went
to him and placed her hands on his chest and on his back. he was
ill for three market weeks, and when he recovered he seemed to

he went to her hut to see what she was doing. there was nobody in
the hut and the fireplace was cold.

"where is ojiugo?" he asked his second wife, who came out of her
hut to draw water from a gigantic pot in the shade of a small tree in
the middle of the compound.

"she has gone to plait her hair."

okonkwo bit his lips as anger welled up within him.



"where are her children? did she take them?" he asked with
unusual coolness and restraint.

"they are here," answered his first wife, nwoye's mother.
okonkwo bent down and looked into her hut. ojiugo's children
were eating with the children of his first wife.



"did she ask you to feed them before she went?"

"yes," lied nwoye's mother, trying to minimize ojiugo's
thoughtlessness.

okonkwo knew she was not speaking the truth. he walked back to
his obi to await ojiugo's return. and when she returned he beat her
very heavily. in his anger he had forgotten that it was the week of
peace. his first two wives ran out in great alarm plea

 to it. as the smoke rose into the sky kites appeared
from different directions and hovered over the burning field in
silent valediction. the rainy season was approaching when they
would go away until the dry season returned.

okonkwo spent the next few days preparing his seed-yams. he
looked at each yam carefully to see whether it was good for sowing.
sometimes he decided that a yam was too big to be sown as one
seed and he split it deftly along its length with his sharp knife. his
eldest son, nwoye, and ikemefuna helped him by fetching the
yams in long baskets from the barn and in counting the prepared
seeds in groups of four hundred. sometimes okonkwo gave them a
few yams each to prepare. but he always found fault with their
effort, and he said so with much threatening.



"do you think you are cutting up yams for cooking?" he asked
nwoye. "if you split another yam of this size, i shall break your
jaw. you think you are still a child. i began to own a farm at your
age. and you," he said

s of umuofia, children sat around their mother's
cooking fire telling stories, or with their father in his obi warming
themselves from a log fire, roasting and eating maize. it was a brief
resting period between the exacting and arduous planting season
and the equally exacting but light-hearted month of harvests.

ikemefuna had begun to feel like a member of okonkwo's family.
he still thought about his mother and his three-year-old sister, and
he had moments of sadness and depression but he and nwoye had
become so deeply attached to each other that such moments
became less frequent and less poignant. ikemefuna had an endless
stock of folk tales. even those which nwoye knew already were
told with a new freshness and the local flavor of a different clan.
nwoye remembered this period very vividly till the end of his life.
he even remembered how he had laughed when ikemefuna told
him that the proper name for a corn cob with only a few scattered
grains was eze-agadi-nwayi, or the teeth of an old

 woman.
nwoye's mind had gone immediately to nwayieke, who lived near
the udala tree. she had about three teeth and was always smoking
her pipe.




gradually the rains became lighter and less frequent, and earth and
sky once again became separate. the rain fell in thin, slanting
showers through sunshine and quiet breeze. children no longer
stayed indoors but ran about singing:

"the rain is falling, the sun is shining, alone nnadi is cooking and
eating."

nwoye always wondered who nnadi was and why he should live
all by himself, cooking and eating. in the end he decided that
nnadi must live in that land of ikemefuna's favorite story where
the ant holds his court in splendor and the sands dance forever.

the feast of the new yam was approaching and umuofia was in a
festival mood. it was an occasion for giving thanks to ani, the
earth goddess and the source of all fertility. ani played a greater

ver the fowl. she put back the empty pot on the
circular pad in the corner, and looked at her palms, which were
black with soot. ezinma was always surprised that her mother
could lift a pot from the fire with her bare hands.



"ekwefi," she said, "is it true that when people are grown up, fire
does not burn them?" ezinma, unlike most children, called her
mother by her name.



"yes," replied ekwefi, too busy to argue. her daughter was only
ten years old but she was wiser than her years.

"but nwoye's mother dropped her pot of hot soup the other day
and it broke on the floor."

ekwefi turned the hen over in the mortar and began to pluck the
feathers.

"ekwefi," said ezinma, who had joined in plucking the feathers,
"my eyelid is twitching."

"it means you are going to cry," said her mother.

"no," ezinma said, "it is this eyelid, the top one."

"that means you will see something."

"what will i see?" she asked.

"how can i know?" ekwefi wanted her to work it out herself.

"oho," said ezinma

 at last. "i know what it isâ€”the wrestling
match."

at last the hen was plucked clean. ekwefi tried to pull out the
horny beak but it was too hard. she turned round on her low stool
and put the beak in the fire for a few moments. she pulled again
and it came off.

"ekwefi!" a voice called from one of the other huts. it was
nwoye's mother, okonkwo's first wife.



"is that me?" ekwefi called back. that was the way people
answered calls from outside. they never answered yes for fear it
might be an evil spirit calling.



"will you give ezinma some fire to bring to me?" her own
children and ikemefuna had gone to the stream.

ekwefi put a few live coals into a piece of broken pot and ezinma
carried it across the clean swept compound to nwoye's mother.

"thank you, nma," she said. she was peeling new yams, and in a
basket 
 
 ___________________________
 
beside her were green vegetables and beans.

"let me make the fire for you," ezinma offered.

"thank you, ezigbo," she said. she often called her ezigbo, which
means "the good one."

ezinma went outside and brought some sticks from a huge bundle
of firewood. she broke them into little pieces across the sole of her
foot and began to build a fire, blowing it with her breath.

"you will blow your eyes out," said nwoye's mother, looking up
from the yams she was peeling. "use the fan." she stood up and
pulled out the fan which was fastened into one of the rafters. as
soon as she got up, the troublesome nanny goat, which had been
dutifully eating yam peelings, dug her teeth into the real thing,
scooped out two mouthfuls and fled from the hut to chew the cud
in the goats' shed. nwoye's mother swore at her and settled down
again to her peeling. ezinma's fire was now sending up thick
clouds of smoke. she went on f

anning it until it burst into flames.
nwoye's mother thanked her and she went back to her mother's hut.

just then the distant beating of drums began to reach them. it came
from the direction of the ilo, the village playground. every village
had its own ilo which was as old as the village itself and where all



the great ceremonies and dances took place. the drums beat the
unmistakable wrestling dance - quick, light and gay, and it came
floating on the wind.



okonkwo cleared his throat and moved his feet to the beat of the
drums. it

filled him with fire as it had always done from his youth.
he trembled with the desire to conquer and subdue. it was like the
desire for woman.

"we shall be late for the wrestling," said ezinma to her mother.

"they will not begin until the sun goes down."

"but they are beating the drums."

"yes. the drums begin at noon but the wrestling waits until the sun
begins to sink. go and see if your father has brought out yams for
the afternoon."

"he has. nwoye's mother is already cooking."

"go and bring our own, then. we must cook quickly or we shall be
late for the wrestling."

ezinma ran in the direction of the barn and brought back two yams
from the dwarf wall.

ekwefi peeled the yams quickly. the troublesome nanny-goat
sniffed about, eating the peelings. she cut the yams into small
pieces and began to prepare a pottage, using some of the chicken.

at that moment they heard someone crying just outside their
compound. it was very much like obiagel

i, nwoye's sister.

"is that not obiageli weeping?" ekwefi called across the yard to
nwoye's mother.



"yes," she replied. "she must have broken her waterpot."



the weeping was now quite close and soon the children filed in,
carrying on their heads various sizes of pots suitable to their years.
ikemefuna came first with the biggest pot, closely followed by
nwoye and his two younger brothers. obiageli brought up the rear,
her face streaming with tears. in her hand was the cloth pad on
which the pot should have rested on her head.

"what happened?" her mother asked, and obiageli told her
mournful story. her mother consoled her and promised to buy her
her another pot.

nwoye's younger brothers were about to tell their mother the true
story of the accident when ikemefuna looked at them sternly and
they held their peace. the fact was that obiageli had been

chapter seven

for three years ikemefuna lived in okonkwo's household and the
elders of umuofia seemed to have forgotten about him. he grew
rapidly like a yam tendril in the rainy season, and was full of the
sap of life. he had become wholly absorbed into his new family.
he was like an elder brother to nwoye, and from the very first
seemed to have kindled a new fire in the younger boy. he made
him feel grown-up, and they no longer spent the evenings in his
mother's hut while she cooked, but now sat with okonkwo in his
obi, or watched him as he tapped his palm tree for the evening
wine. nothing pleased nwoye now more than to be sent for by his
mother or another of his father's wives to do one of those difficult
and masculine tasks in the home, like splitting wood, or pounding
food. on receiving such
 
 ___________________________
 
 a message through a younger brother or
sister, nwoye would feign annoyance and grumble aloud about
women and their troubles.

okonkwo was inwardly pleased at his son's development, and he
knew it was due to ikemefuna. he wanted nwoye to grow into a
tough young man capable of ruling his father's household when he
was dead and gone to join the ancestors.

he wanted him to be a prosperous man, having enough in his barn
to feed the ancestors with regular sacrifices. and so he was always
happy when he heard him grumbling about women. that showed
that in time he would be able to control his women-folk. no matter
how prosperous a man was, if he was unable to rule his women and
his children (and especially his women) he was not rea

lly a man.



he was like the man in the song who had ten and one wives and
not enough soup for his foo-foo.



so okonkwo encouraged the boys to sit with him in his obi, and he
told them stories of the landâ€”masculine stories of violence and
bloodshed. nwoye knew that it was right to be masculine and to be
violent, but somehow he still preferred the stories that his mother
used to tell, and which she no doubt still told to her younger
childrenâ€”stories of the tortoise and his wily ways, and of the bird
eneke-nti-oba who challenged the whole world to a wrestling
contest and was finally thrown by the cat. he remembered the
story she often told of the quarrel between earth and sky long ago,
and how sky withheld rain for seven years, until crops withe

and the dead could not be buried because the hoes broke on the
stony earth. at last vulture was sent to plead with sky, and to
soften his heart with a song of the suffering of the sons of men.
whenever nwoye's mother sang this song he felt carried away to
the distant scene in the sky where vulture, earth's emissary, sang
for mercy. at last sky was moved to pity, and he gave to vulture
rain wrapped in leaves of coco-yam. but as he flew home his long
talon pierced the leaves and the rain fell as it had never fallen
before. and so heavily did it rain on

vulture that he did not return to deliver his message but flew to a
distant land, from where he had espied a fire. and when he got
there he found it

was a man making a sacrifice. he warmed
himself in the fire and ate the entrails.

that was the kind of story that nwoye loved. but he now knew
that they were for foolish women and children, and he knew that
his father wanted him to be a man. and so he feigned that he no
longer cared for women's stories. and when he did this he saw that
his father was pleased, and no longer rebuked him or beat him. so
nwoye and ikemefuna would listen to okonkwo's stories about
tribal wars, or how, years ago, he had stalked his victim,



overpowered him and obtained his first human head. and as he
told them of the past they sat in darkness or the dim glow of logs,
waiting for the women to finish their cooking. when they finished,
each brought her bowl of foo-foo and bowl of soup to her husband.
an oil lamp was lit and okonkwo tasted from each bowl, and then
passed two shares to nwoye and ikemefuna.



in this way

lders counseled patience till nightfall. and they were right. the
locusts settled in the bushes for the night and their wings became



wet with dew. then all umuofia turned out in spite of the cold
harmattan, and everyone filled his bags and pots with locusts. the
next morning they were roasted in clay pots and then spread in the
sun until they became dry and brittle. and for many days this rare
food was eaten with solid palm-oil.



okonkwo sat in his obi crunching happily with ikemefuna and
nwoye, and drinking palm-wine copiously, when ogbuefi ezeudu
came in. ezeudu was the oldest man in this quarter of umuofia. he
had been a great and fearless warrior in his time, and was now
accorded great respect in all the clan. he refused to join in the meal,
and asked okonkwo to have a word with him outside. and so they
walked out together, the old man supporting himself with his stick.
when they were out of earshot, he said to okonkwo:

"that boy calls you father. do not bear a hand in his death.
 
 ___________________________
 
"
okonkwo was surprised, and was about to say something when the
old man continued:

"yes, umuofia has decided to kill him. the oracle of the hills and
the caves has pronounced it. they will take him outside umuofia
as is the custom, and kill him there. but i want you to have nothing
to do with it. he calls you his father."

the next day a group of elders from all the nine villages of
umuofia came to okonkwo's house early in the morning, and
before they began to speak in low tones nwoye and ikemefuna
were sent out. they did not stay very long, but when they went
away okonkwo sat still for a very long time supporting his chin in
his palms. later in the day he called ikemefuna and told him that
he was to be taken home the next day. nwoye overheard it and
burst into tears, whereupon his father beat him heavily. as for
ikemefuna, he was at a loss. his own home had gradually become
very faint and distant. he still missed his mother and his sister and
would be very glad to see them.

 but somehow he knew he was not



going to see them. he remembered once when men had talked in
low tones with his father, and it seemed now as if it was happening
all over again.



later, nwoye went to his mother's hut and told her that ikemefuna
was going home. she immediately dropped her pestle with which
she was grinding pepper, folded her arms across her breast and
sighed, "poor child."

the next day, the men returned with a pot of wine. they were all
fully dressed as if they were going to a big clan meeting or to pay a
visit to a neighboring village. they passed their cloths under the
right arm-pit, and hung their goatskin bags and sheathed machetes
over their left shoulders. oko

nkwo got ready quickly and the party
set out with ikemefuna carrying the pot of wine. a deathly silence
descended on okonkwo's compound. even the very little children
seemed to know. throughout that day nwoye sat in his mother's
hut and tears stood in his eyes.

at the beginning of their journey the men of umuofia talked and
laughed about the locusts, about their women, and about some
effeminate men who had refused to come with them. but as they
drew near to the outskirts of umuofia silence fell upon them too.

the sun rose slowly to the center of the sky, and the dry, sandy
footway began to throw up the heat that lay buried in it. some
birds chirruped in the forests around. the men trod dry leaves

very distant indeed. but his mother and his three-year-old sisterâ€¦
of course she would not be three now, but six. would he recognize
her now? she must have grown quite big. how his mother would
weep for joy, and thank okonkwo for having looked after him so
well and for bringing him back. she would want to hear everything
that had happened to him in all these years. could he remember
them all? he would tell her about nwoye and his mother, and
about the locustsâ€¦ then quite suddenly a thought came upon him.
his mother might be dead. he tried in vain to force the thought out
of his mind. then he tried to settle the matter the way he used to



settle such matters when he was a little boy. he still remembered
the song:



eze elina, elina!

he sang it in his mind, and walked to its beat. if the song ended on

okonkwo withdrawn to the rear? ikemefuna felt his legs melting
under him. and he was afraid to look back.

as the man who had cleared his throat drew up and raised his
machete, okonkwo looked away. he heard the blow. the pot fell
and broke in the sand. he heard ikemefuna cry, "my father, they
have killed me!" as he ran towards him. dazed with fear, okonkwo
drew his machete and cut him down. he was afraid of being
thought weak.





as soon as his father walked in, that night, nwoye knew that
ikemefuna had been killed, and something seemed to give way
inside him, like the snapping of a tightened bow. he did not cry.
he just hung limp. he had had the same kind of feeling not long
ago, during the last harvest season. every child loved the harvest
season. those who were big enough to carry even a few yams in a
tiny basket went with grown-ups to the farm. and if they could not
help in digging up the yams, they could gather firewood together
for roasting the ones that would be

eaten there on the farm. this
roasted yam soaked in red palm-oil and eaten in the open farm was
sweeter than any meal at home. it was after such a day at the farm
during the last harvest that nwoye had felt for the first time a
snapping inside him like the one he now felt. they were returning
home with baskets of yams from a distant farm across the stream
when they heard the voice of an infant crying in the thick forest. a
sudden hush had fallen on the women, who had been talking, and
they had quickened their steps. nwoye had heard that twins were
put in earthenware pots and thrown away in the forest, but he had
never yet come across them. a vague chill had descended on him
and his head h

eemed to swell, like a solitary walker at night
who passes an evil spirit an the way. then something had given
way inside him. it descended on him again, this feeling, when his
father walked in that night after killing ikemefuna.

chapter eight

okonkwo did not taste any food for two days after the death of
ikemefuna. he drank palm-wine from morning till night, and his
eyes were red and fierce like the eyes of a rat when it was caught
by the tail and dashed against the floor. he called his son, nwoye,
to sit with him in his obi. but the boy was afraid of him and
slipped out of the hut as soon as he noticed him dozing.

he did not sleep at night. he tried not to think about ikemefuna,-
but the more he tried the more he thought about him. once he got



up from bed and walked about his compound. but he was so weak
that his legs could hardly carry him. he felt like a drunken giant
walking with the limbs of a mosquito. now and then a cold shiver
descended on his head and spread down his body.

boy," okonkwo said to himself again. his mind went back to
ikemefuna and he shivered. if only he could find some work to do
he would be able to forget. but it was the season of rest between
the harvest and the next planting season. the only work that men
did at this time was covering the walls of their compound with new
palm fronds. and okonkwo had already done that. he had finished
it on the very day the locusts came, when he had worked on one
side of the wall and ikemefuna and nwoye on the other.

"when did you become a shivering old woman," okonkwo asked
himself, "you, who are known in all the nine villages for your valor
in war? how can a man who has killed five men in battle fall to
pieces because he has added a boy to their number? okonkwo, you
have become a woman indeed."

he sprang to his feet, hung his goatskin bag on his shoulder and
went to visit his friend, obierika.

obierika was sitting outside under the shade of an orange tree
making thatches from leaves of th

i hope we will clinch the matter of the bride-price. i want you to be

just then obierika's son, maduka, came into the obi from outside,
greeted okonkwo and turned towards the compound,



"come and shake hands with me," okonkwo said to the lad. "your
wrestling the other day gave me much happiness." the boy smiled,
shook hands with okonkwo and went into the compound.



"he will do great things," okonkwo said. "if i had a son like him i
should be happy. i am worried about nwoye. a bowl of pounded
yams can throw him in a wrestling match. his two younger
brothers are more promising. but i can tell you, obierika, that my
children do not resemble me. where are the young suckers that
will grow when the old banana tree dies? if ezinma had been a boy
i would have been happier. she has the right spirit."

"you worry yourself for nothing," said obierika. "the children are
still very young."

"nwoye is old enough to impregnate a woman. at his age i was

there is too much of his mother in him."

"too much of his grandfather," obierika thought, but he did not
say it. the same thought also came to okonkwo's mind. but he had
long learned how to lay that ghost. whenever the thought of his
father's weakness and failure troubled him he expelled it by
thinking about his own strength and success. and so he did now.
his mind went to his latest show of manliness.

"i cannot understand why you refused to come with us to kill that

 or perhaps a dark line where the

by the time onwumbiko died ekwefi had become a very bitter
woman. her husband's first wife had already had three sons, all
strong and healthy. when she had borne her third son in succession,
okonkwo had slaughtered a goat for her, as was the custom.
ekwefi had nothing but good wishes for her. but she had grown so
bitter about her own chi that she could not rejoice with others over
their good fortune. and so, on the day that nwoye's mother
celebrated the birth of her three sons with feasting and music,
ekwefi was the only person in the happy company who went about
with a cloud on her brow. her husband's wife took this for
malevolence, as husbands' wives were wont to. how could she
know that ekwefi's bitterness did not flow outwards to others but
inwards into her own soul,- that she did not blame others for their
good fortune but her own evil chi  who denied her any?

at last ezinma was born, and although ailing she seeme

he killed her," said ezinma.

"that is not the end of the story."

"oho," said ezinma. "i remember now. he brought another seven
baskets and cooked them himself. and there were again only three.
so he killed himself too."

outside the obi okagbue and okonkwo were digging the pit to
find where ezinma had buried her iyi-uwa. neighbors sat around,
watching. the pit was now so deep that they no longer saw the
digger. they only saw the red earth he threw up mounting higher
and higher. okonkwo's son, nwoye, stood near the edge of the pit
because he wanted to take in all that happened.

okagbue had again taken over the digging from okonkwo. he
worked, as usual, in silence. the neighbors and okonkwo's wives
were now talking. the children had lost interest and were playing.

suddenly okagbue sprang to the surface with the agility of a
leopard.

"it is very near now," he said. "i have felt it."

there was immediate excitement and those who were sitting
jumped to their feet.

she walked through okonkwo's hut into the circular compound
and went straight toward ekwefi's hut. okonkwo came after her.

"ekwefi," she called, "agbala greets you. where is my daughter,
ezinma? agbala wants to see her."



ekwefi came out from her hut carrying her oil lamp in her left
hand. there was a light wind blowing, so she cupped her right
hand to shelter the flame. nwoye's mother, also carrying an oil
lamp, emerged from her hut. the children stood in the darkness
outside their hut watching the strange event. okonkwo's youngest
wife also came out and joined the others.



"where does agbala want to see her?" ekwefi asked.

"where else but in his house in the hills and the caves?" replied the
priestess.

"i will come with you, too," ekwefi said firmly.

"tufia-al" the priestess cursed, her voice cracking like the angry
bark of thunder in the dry season. "how dare

 was crying loudly now, calling on her mother. the two
voices disappeared into the thick darkness.

a strange and sudden weakness descended on ekwefi as she stood
gazing in the direction of the voices like a hen whose only chick
has been carried away by a kite. ezinma's voice soon faded away
and only chielo was heard moving farther and farther into the
distance.

"why do you stand there as though she had been kidnapped?"
asked okonkwo as he went back to his hut.

"she will bring her back soon," nwoye's mother said.

but ekwefi did not hear these consolations. she stood for a while,
and then, all of a sudden, made up her mind. she hurried through
okonkwo's hut and went outside. "where are you going?" he asked.

"i am following chielo," she replied and disappeared in the
darkness. okonkwo cleared his throat, and brought out his snuff-
bottle from the goatskin bag by his side.

the priestess' voice was already growing faint in the distance.
ekwefi hurried to the main footpath and turned left i

ediate relatives but to the wide and
extensive group of kinsmen called umunna. everybody had been
invitedâ€”men, women and children. but it was really a woman's
ceremony and the central figures were the bride and her mother.

as soon as day broke, breakfast was hastily eaten and women and
children began to gather at obierika's compound to help the bride's
mother in her difficult but happy task of cooking for a whole
village.

okonkwo's family was astir like any other family in the
neighborhood. nwoye's mother and okonkwo's youngest wife
were ready to set out for obierika's compound with all their
children. nwoye's mother carried a basket of coco-yams, a cake of
salt and smoked fish which she would present to obierika's wife.
okonkwo's youngest wife, ojiugo, also had a basket of plantains
and coco-yams and a small pot of palm-oil. their children carried
pots of water.

ekwefi was tired and sleepy from the exhausting experiences of
the previous night. it was not very long since they had retur

 surprise at finding
them at the mouth of the cave. she looked straight ahead of her and
walked back to the village. okonkwo and his wife followed at a
respectful distance. they thought the priestess might be going to
her house, but she went to okonkwo's compound, passed through
his obi and into ekwefi's hut and walked into her bedroom. she
placed ezinma carefully on the bed and went away without saying
a word to anybody.

ezinma was still sleeping when everyone else was astir, and
ekwefi asked nwoye's mother and ojiugo to explain to obierika's
wife that she would be late. she had got ready her basket of coco-
yams and fish, but she must wait for ezinma to wake.

"you need some sleep yourself," said nwoye's mother. "you look
very tired."

as they spoke ezinma emerged from the hut, rubbing her eyes and
stretching her spare frame. she saw the other children with their
water-pots and remembered that they were going to fetch water for
obierika's wife. she went back to the hut and brought her po

t.

"have you slept enough?" asked her mother.

"yes," she replied. "let us go."

"not before you have had your breakfast," said ekwefi. and she
went into her hut to warm the vegetable soup she had cooked last
night.

"we shall be going," said nwoye's mother. "i will tell obierika's
wife that you are coming later." and so they all went to help
obierika's wifeâ€”nwoye's mother with her four children and
ojiugo with her two.



as they trooped through okonkwo's obi he asked: "who will
prepare my afternoon meal?"



"i shall return to do it," said ojiugo.

okonkwo was also feeling tired, and sleepy, for although nobody
else knew it, he had not slept at all last night. he had felt very
anxious but did not show it. when ekwefi had followed the
priestess, he had allowed what he regarded as a reasonable and
manly interval to pass and then gone with his machete to

 the seas, but no one thought the stories were true."

"there is no story that is not true," said uchendu. "the world has
no end, and what is good among one people is an abomination with
others. we have albinos among us. do you not think that they
came to our clan by mistake, that they have strayed from their way
to a land where everybody is like them?"

okonkwo's first wife soon finished her cooking and set before their
guests a big meal of pounded yams and bitter-leaf soup.



okonkwo's son, nwoye, brought in a pot of sweet wine tapped
from the raffia palm.



"you are a big man now," obierika said to nwoye. "your friend
anene asked me to greet you."

"is he well?" asked nwoye.

"we are all well," said obierika.

ezinma brought them a bowl of water with which to wash their
hands. after that they began to eat and to drink the wine.

"when did you set out from home?" asked okonkwo.

"we had meant to set out from my house before cockcrow," said
obierika. "but nweke did not appear until it w

was heeded in ihe assembly of the
people. none of them was a man of title. they were mostly the
kind of people that were called efulefu, worthless, empty men. the
imagery of an efulefu in the language of the clan was a man who
sold his machete and wore the sheath to battle. chielo, the priestess
of agbala, called the converts the excrement of the clan, and the
new faith was a mad dog that had come to eat it up.

what moved obierika to visit okonkwo was the sudden
appearance of the latter's son, nwoye, among the missionaries in
umuofia.



"what are you doing here?" obierika had asked when  after many
difficulties the missionaries had allowed him to speak to the boy.



"1 am one of them," replied nwoye.

"how is your father?" obierika asked, not knowing what else to
say.

"1 don't know. he is not my father," said nwoye, unhappily.

and so obierika went to mbanta to see his friend. and he found
that okonkwo did not wish to speak about nwoye. it was only
from nwoye's mother that he heard scr

crowd agreed.

"i did not say he had a wife," said the interpreter, somewhat
lamely.

"your buttocks said he had a son," said the joker. "so he must have
a wife and all of them must have buttocks."



the missionary ignored him and went on to talk about the holy
trinity. at the end of it okonkwo was fully convinced that the
man was mad. he shrugged his shoulders and went away to tap his
afternoon palm-wine.



but there was a young lad who had been captivated. his name was
nwoye, okonkwo's first son. it was not the mad logic of the
trinity that captivated him. he did not understand it. it was the
poetry of the new religion, something felt in the marrow. the
hymn about brothers who sat in darkness and in fear seemed to
answer a vague and persistent question that haunted his young
soulâ€”the question of the twins crying in the bush and the question
of ikemefuna who was killed. he lelt a relief within as the hymn
poured into his parched soul. the words of the hymn were li

     the missionaries spent their first four or five nights in the
marketplace, and went into the village in the morning to preach the
gospel. they asked who the king of the village was, but the
villagers told them that there was no king. "we have men of high
title and the chief priests and the elders," they said.

  it was not very easy getting the men of high title and the elders
together after the excitement of the first day. but the arr

everyone was puzzled. and then it became known that the white
man's fetish had unbelievable power. it was said that he wore
glasses on his eyes so that he could see and talk to evil spirits. not
long after, he won his first three converts.

although nwoye had been attracted to the new faith from the very
first day, he kept it secret. he dared not go too near the
missionaries for fear of his father. but whenever they came to
preach in the open marketplace or the village play

ground, nwoye was there. and he was already beginning to know
some of the simple stories they told.




"we have now built a church," said mr. kiaga, the interpreter, who
was now in charge of the infant congregation. the white man had
gone back to umuofia, where he built hi

where he paid regular visits to mr. kiaga's congregation at mbanta.

"we have now built a church," said mr. kiaga, "and we want you
all to come in every seventh day to worship the true god."

on the following sunday, nwoye passed and repassed the little
red-earth and thatch building without summoning enough courage
to enter. he heard the voice of singing and although it came from a
handful of men it was loud and confident. their church stood on a
circular clearing that looked like the open mouth of the evil forest.
was it waiting to snap its teeth together? after passing and re-
passing by the church, nwoye returned home.

it was well known among the people of mbanta that their gods and
ancestors were sometimes l

nneka had had four previous pregnancies and child-births. but
each time she had borne twins, and they had been immediately



thrown away. her husband and his family were already becoming
highly critical of such a woman and were not unduly perturbed
when they found she had fled to join the christians. it was a good
riddance.



one morning okonkwo's cousin, amikwu, was passing by the
church on his way from the neighboring village, when he saw
nwoye among the christians. he was greatly surprised, and when
he got home he went straight to okonkwo's hut and told him what
he had seen. the women began to talk excitedly, but okonkwo sat
unmoved.

it was late afternoon before nwoye returned. he went into the obi
and saluted his father, but he did not answer. nwoye turned round
to walk into the inner compound when his father, suddenly
overcome with fury, sprang to his feet and gripped him by the neck.

"where have you been?" he stammered.

nwoye s

truggled to free himself from the choking grip.

"answer me," roared okonkwo, "before i kill you!" he seized a
heavy stick that lay on the dwarf wall and hit him two or three
savage blows.

"answer me!" he roared again. nwoye stood looking at him and
did not say a word. the women were screaming outside, afraid to
go in.

"leave that boy at once!" said a voice in the outer compound. it
was okonkwo's uncle, uchendu. "are you mad?"

okonkwo did not answer. but he left hold of nwoye, who walked
away and never returned.




he went back to the church and told mr. kiaga that he had decided
to go to umuofia where the white missionary had set up a school
to teach young christians to read and write.

mr. kiaga's joy was very great. "blessed is he who forsakes his
father and his mother for my sake," he intoned. "those that hear
my words are my father and my mother."

nwoye did not fully understand. but he was happy to leave his
father. he would return later to his mother and hi

s brothers and
sisters and convert them to the new faith.

as okonkwo sat in his hut that night, gazing into a log fire, he
thought over the matter. a sudden fury rose within him and he felt
a strong desire to take up his machete, go to the church and wipe
out the entire vile and miscreant gang. but on further thought he
told himself that nwoye was not worth fighting for. why, he cried
in his heart, should he, okonkwo, of all people, be cursed with
such a son? he saw clearly in it the finger of his personal god or
chi. for how else could he explain his great misfortune and exile
and now his despicable son's behavior? now that he had time to
think of it, his son's crime stood out in its stark enormity. to
abandon the gods of one's father and go about with a lot of
effeminate men clucking like old hens was the very depth of
abomination.

 suppose when he died all his male children decided
to follow nwoye's steps and abandon their ancestors? okonkwo
felt a cold shudder run through him at the terrible prospect, like the
prospect of annihilation. he saw himself and his fathers crowding
round their ancestral shrine waiting in vain for worship and
sacrifice and finding nothing but ashes of bygone days, and his
children the while praying to the white man's god. if such a thing
were ever to happen, he, okonkwo, would wipe them off the face
of the earth.





okonkwo was popularly called the "roaring 
 
 ___________________________
 
flame." as he looked
into the log fire he recalled the name. he was a flaming fire. how
then could he have begotten a son like nwoye, degenerate and
effeminate? perhaps he was not his son. no! he could not be. his
wife had played him false. he would teach her! but nwoye
resembled his grandfather, unoka, who was okonkwo's father. he
pushed the thought out of his mind. he, okonkwo, was called a
flaming fire. how could he have begotten a woman for a son? at
nwoye's age okonkwo had already become famous throughout
umuofia for his wrestling and his fearlessness.

he sighed heavily, and as if in sympathy the smoldering log also
sighed. and immediately okonkwo's eyes were opened and he saw
the whole matter clearly. living fire begets cold, impotent ash. he
sighed again, deeply.

chapter eighteen

the young church in mbanta had a few crises early in its life. at
first the clan had assumed that it would not survive. but it had
gone on living and gradually bec

utiful, and the other an old and
faint shadow. the rainbow was called the python of the sky.

okonkwo called his three wives and told them to get things
together for a great feast. "i must thank my mother's kinsmen
before i go," he said.

ekwefi still had some cassava left on her farm from the previous
year. neither of the other wives had. it was not that they had been



lazy, but that they had many children to feed. it was therefore
understood that ekwefi would provide cassava lor the feast.
nwoye's mother and ojiugo would provide the  other things like
smoked fish, palm-oil and pepper for the soup. okonkwo would
take care of meat and yams.



ekwefi rose early on the following morning and went to her farm
with her daughter, ezinma, and ojiugo's daughter, obiageli, to
harvest cassava tubers. each of them carried a long cane basket, a
machete for cutting down the soft cassava stem, and a little hoe for
digging out the tuber. fortunately, a light rain had fallen during the
night and the so

spirit. but it was a resilient
spirit, and in the end okonkwo overcame his sorrow. he had five
other sons and he would bring them up in the way of the clan.



he sent for the five sons and they came and sat in his obi. the
youngest of them was four years old.

"you have all seen the great abomination of your brother. now he
is no longer my son or your brother. i will only have a son who is a
man, who will hold his head up among my people. if any one of
you prefers to be a woman, let him follow nwoye now while i am
alive so that i can curse him. if you turn against me when i am
dead i will visit you and break your neck."

okonkwo was very lucky in his daughters. he never stopped
regretting that ezinma was a girl. of all his children she alone
understood his every mood. a bond of sympathy had grown
between them as the years had passed.

ezinma grew up in her father's exile and became one of the most
beautiful girls in mbanta. she was called crystal of beauty, as her
mother had been called in

ength to strength, and because of its
link with the new administration it earned a new social prestige.
but mr. brown himself was breaking down in health. at first he
ignored the warning signs. but in the end he had to leave his flock,
sad and broken.



it was in the first rainy season after okonkwo's return to umuofia
that mr. brown left for home. as soon as he had learned of
okonkwo's return five months earlier, the missionary had
immediately paid him a visit. he had just sent okonkwo's son,
nwoye, who was now called isaac, to the new training college for
teachers in umuru. and he had hoped that okonkwo would be
happy to hear of it. but okonkwo had driven him away with the
threat that if he came into his compound again, he would be carried
out of it.

okonkwo's return to his native land was not as memorable as he
had wished. it was true his two beautiful daughters aroused great
interest among suitors and marriage negotiations were soon in
progress, but, beyond that, umuofia did not appea
