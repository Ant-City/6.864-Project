lso detected trace quantities of the gamma-amino metbionine hydrolase. because
this enzyme was a marker for genetic engineering, and not found in wild animals, technicians
assumed it was a lab contaminant and did not report it when they called dr, cruz, the referring
physician in puntarenas.
the lizard fragment rested in the freezer at columbia university, awaiting the return of dr.

not a technician named alice levin walked into the tropical diseases laboratory, seen tina
bowman's picture, and said, "oh, whose kid drew the dinosaur?"
"what?" richard stone said, turning slowly toward her.
"the dinosaur. isn't that what it is? my kid draws them all the time."
"this is a lizard," stone said. "from costa rica. some girl down there drew a picture of it."
"no," alice levin said, shaking her head. "look at it. it's very clear. big head, long neck, stands
on its hind legs, thick tail. it's a dinosaur."
"it can't be

tall."
"so? there were little dinosaurs back then," alice said. "believe me, i know. i have two boys,
i'm an expert. the smallest dinosaurs were under a foot. teenysaurus or something, i don't
know. those names are impossible. you'll never learn those names if you're over the age of ten." 
"you don't understand," richard stone said. "this is a picture of a contemporary animal. they
sent us a fragment of the animal. it's in the freezer now." stone went and got it, and shook it out of
the baggie.
alice levin looked at the frozen piece of leg and tail, and shrugged. she didn't touch it. "i don't
know," she said. "but that looks like a dinosaur to me."
stone shook his head. "impossible."
"why?" alice levin said. "it could be a leftover or a remnant or whatever they call them."
stone continued to shake his head. alice was uninformed; she was just a technician who
worked in the bacteriology lab down the hall. and she had an active imagination. stone
remembered the time when she thought she was being fo

"you know," alice levin said, "if this is a dinosaur, richard, it could be a big deal."
"it's not a dinosaur."
"has anybody checked it. "no,"
stone said.
"well, take it to the museum of natural history or something," alice levin said. "you really
should."
"i'd be embarrassed."
"you want me to do it for you?" she said.
"no," richard stone said. "i don't."
"you're not going to do anything?"
"nothing at all." he put the baggie back in the freezer and slammed the door. "it's not a
dinosaur, it's a lizard. and whatever it is, it can wait until dr. simpson gets back from borneo to
identify it. that's final, alice. this lizard's not going anywhere."

morris held out his band. "well, thanks again for your help."
"take it easy driving back," grant said. he watched for a moment as morris walked back
toward his car, and then closed the trailer door.
grant said, "what did you think?"
ellie shrugged. "naâ€¹ve."
"you like the part where john hammond is the evil arch-villain?" grant laughed. "john
hammond's about as sinister as walt disney. by the way, who called?"
"oh," ellie said, "it was a woman named alice levin. she works at columbia medical center.
you know her?"
grant shook his head. "no."
"well, it was something about identifying some remains. she wants you to call her back right
away."

ellie sattler brushed a strand of blond hair back from her face and turned her attention to the acid

the stronger solutions, because they would eat through the limestone and begin to erode the

d florida. the air was denser. the land was warmer. there were
hundreds of active volcanoes. and it was in this environment that procompsognathus lived.
"well," ellie said. "we know animals have survived. crocodiles are basically triassic animals
living in the present. sharks are triassic. so we know it has happened before."
grant nodded. "and the thing is," he said, "how else do we explain it? it's either a fake-which i
doubt-or else it's a rediscovery. what else could it be?"
the phone rang. "alice levin again," grant said. "let's see if she'll send us the actual
specimen." he answered it and looked at ellie, surprised. "yes, i'll hold for mr. hammond. yes.
of course."
"hammond? what does he want?" ellie said.
grant shook his head, and then said into the phone, "yes, mr. hammond. yes, it's good to
hear your voice, too. . . .yes . . . ." he looked at ellie. "oh, you did? oh yes? is that right?"
he cupped his hand over the mouthpiece and said, "still as eccentric as ever. you've got to
