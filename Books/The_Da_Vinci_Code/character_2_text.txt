ieldstone house enjoying the sounds of laughter
and reunion drifting through the screened door behind him. the mug of potent brazilian coffee in
his hand had granted him a hazy reprieve from his mounting exhaustion, and yet he sensed the
reprieve would be fleeting. the fatigue in his body went to the core.

"you slipped out quietly," a voice behind him said.

he turned. sophie's grandmother emerged, her silver hair shimmering in the night. her name, for
the last twenty-eight years at least, was marie chauvel.

langdon gave a tired smile. "i thought i'd give your family some time together." through the
window, he could see sophie talking with her brother.

marie came over and stood beside him. "mr. langdon, when i first heard of jacques's murder, i
was terrified for sophie's safety. seeing her standing in my doorway tonight was the greatest relief
of my life. i cannot thank you enough."

langdon had no idea how to respond. although he had offered to give sophie and her grandmother
time to talk in pr

church pressuring your husband not to release the sangreal documents at the end of days?"

"heavens no. the end of days is a legend of paranoid minds. there is nothing in the priory
doctrine that identifies a date at which the grail should be unveiled. in fact the priory has always

"and you are saying that in all the hundreds of symbols we have here in rosslyn chapel, these two



shapes appear nowhere?"

"i didn't see them."

"and if i show them to you, will you get some sleep?"

pointed to the center of the sanctuary floor. "there you are, mr. langdon. the blade and chalice."

place for sauniere to keep watch? now at last, he sensed he understood the true meaning of the
grand master's verse. raising his eyes to heaven, he gazed upward through the glass to a glorious,
star-filled night.
