the garbage c. l for lily. 

i could feel the questions gathering in him, knew 

i could not face them. 

"i'm not hungry," i said, and walked out the back 

door. 

crossing the back porch, i heard rosaleen say to 

him, "have you registered yourself to vote?"

on  sunday  i  thought  they  would  go  to  church, 
but no, they held a special service in the pink house, and 
people  came  to  them.  it  was  a  group  called  the  
daughters of mary, which august had organized.

the daughters of mary started showing up in the 
parlor before 10:00 a.m. first was an old woman named 
queenie  and  her  grown  daughter,  violet.  they  were 
dressed  alike in  bright yellow  skirts  and white  blouses, 
though  they  wore  different  hats,  at  least.  next  came 
lunelle,  mabelee,  and  cressie,  who  wore  the  fanciest 
hats i'd ever laid eyes on. 

it turned out lunelle was a hatmaker without the 
least bit of shyness. i'm talk

"by  the  time  the  next  sunday  came,  everyone 
had heard about the statue  washing up from the  river, 
how  it  had  spoken  to  obadiah.  the  praise  house  was 
filled with people spilling out the door and sitting on the 
window  ledges.  obadiah  told  them  he  knew  the  lord 
god had sent her, but he didn't know who she was." 

"he didn't know who she was!" cried sugar-girl, 
breaking in to the story. then all the daughters of mary 
broke  loose,  saying  over  and  over,  "not  one  of  them 
knew."

when everything had quieted down, august said, 
"now,  the  oldest  of  the  slaves  was  a  woman  named  
pearl.  she  walked  with  a  stick,  and  when  she  spoke, 
everyone  listened.  she  got  to  her  feet  and  said,  "this 
here is the mother of jesus."

the  room  grew  quiet  as  august  stood  there  a 
minute,  letting  everything  sink  in.  when  she  spoke 
again, she raised her  arms out beside her.  "the people 
called  her our lady of  chains. they called her that not 
because she wore chains…" 

"not  because  she  wore  chains,"  the  daughters 

chanted. 

"they called her our lady of chains because she 
broke  them."  june  wedged  the  cello  between  her  legs 
and played "amazing grace," and the daughters of mary 
got  to  their  feet  and  swayed  together  like  colorful 
seaweed  on  the  ocean  floor.  i  thought  this  was  the 
grand  finale,  but  no,  june  switched  over  to  the  piano 
and banged out a jazzed-up version of "go tell it on the 
mountain." that's when august started a conga-line. she 
danced  over  to  lunelle,  who  latched  on  to  august's 
waist.  cressie  hooked  on  to  lunelle,  followed  by 
mabelee, and  off  they  went around the  room,  causing 
cressie to grab hold o

should've  turned  on  the  fans.  it  must've  been  ninety 
degrees in there." 

"i'm all right," i told them, but to tell the truth, i 
was  bewildered  at  myself.  i  felt  i'd  stumbled  upon  an 
amazing secret —it was possible to close your eyes and

exit  life  without  actually  dying.  you  just  had  to  faint. 
only i didn't know how to make it happen, how to pull 
the  plug  so  i  could  drain  away  when  i  needed  to.  my 
fainting spell had broken up the daughters of mary and 
sent may to the wailing wall. june had gone upstairs to 
her  room  and  locked  the  door,  while  the  daughters 
huddled in the kitchen. 

we  chalked  it  up  to  heat.  heat,  we  said.  heat 

would make a person do strange things.

you should have seen how august and rosaleen 
fussed over me the rest of the evening. you want some 
root  beer,  lily?  how  about  a  feather  pillow?  here, 
swallow this spoon of honey. 

we sat in the den, where i ate supper off a tray,

the  worse  it  got,  till  i  was  having  one  big,  hilarious  
seizure. i laughed the way may cried. 

at first zach aimed for the ruts just to hear me, 
but then he got nervous because i couldn't seem to stop. 
he cleared his throat and slowed way down till we were 
bounce-free. 

finally  it  drained  out  of  me,  whatever  it  was.  i  
remembered the pleasure of fainting that day during the 
daughters of mary meeting and thought now how much 
i would like to keel over right here in the truck. i envied 
turtles their shells, how they could disappear at will. 

i  was  conscious  of  zach's  breathing,  his  shirt 
pulled across his chest, one arm draped on the steering 
wheel. the hard, dark look of it. the mystery of his skin. 
it was foolish to think some things were beyond 
happening, even being attracted to negroes. i'd honestly 
thought  such  a  thing  couldn't  happen,  the  way  water 
could

i  looked 
down  and  saw  the  claw-footed  tub  wearing  the  red 
socks may had put on its porcelain feet. i smiled then; i 
couldn't help it. it was the side of may i never wanted to 
forget. i closed my eyes, and all the best pictures of her 
came to me. i saw her corkscrew braids glistening in the 
sprinkler,  her  fingers  arranging  the  graham-cracker 
crumbs,  working  so  hard  on  behalf  of  a  single  roach's 
life. and that hat she wore the day she danced the conga 
line with the daughters of mary. mostly, though, i saw 
the  blaze  of  love  and  anguish  that  had  come  so  often 
into her face. 

in the end it had burned her up.

after  the  autopsy,  after  the  police  made  her 
suicide official, after the funeral home had fixed may up 
as  pretty  as  they  could,  she  came  home  to  the  pink  
house. first thing wednesday morning, august 5, a black

gainst  it,  and  you  could  tell  she  was  doing 
more  than  saying  good-bye  to  may.  she  was  trying  to 
find her own answers to things. 

one afternoon august  and zach and  i went  out 
to the hives and took off the black cloths. august said we 
couldn't  leave  them  on  too  long,  since  the  bees  had 
memorized everything about their hive and a change like 
that could make them disoriented. they might not find 
their way home again, she said. 

tell me about it, i thought. 
the daughters of mary showed up each day just 
before lunch and sat in the parlor with may through the 
afternoon, telling stories about her. we cried a good bit 
also,  but  i  could  tell  we  were  starting  to  feel  better 
about saying good-bye. i only hoped may was feeling all 
right about it, too. 

neil  stayed  at  the  house  nearly  as  much  as  the  
daughters, and seemed downright confused by the way 
june stared into his face. she could barely play the cello, 
because  it  meant  turning  loose of  h

akes, she explained to me in detail how the 
assumption  was  nothing  less  than  mary  rising  up  to 
heaven. mary died and woke up, and the angels carried 
her up there in swirling clouds. 

"may is the one who started calling it mary day," 

said june. 

"it's  not  just  about  the  assumption,  though," 
august  said,  shoveling  the  cakes  onto  the  wire  racks. 
"it's a special remembrance for our own lady of chains. 
we reenact her story. plus we give thanks for the honey 
crop. the daughters of mary come. it's our favorite two 
days of the year." 

"you do this for two days?"

"we  start  this  evening  and  finish  tomorrow 
afternoon,"  said  august.  "hurry  up  with  your  cereal, 
because  you've  got  to  make  streamers  and  garlands, 
hang  the  christmas  lights,  put  out  the  candleholders, 
wash the wagon, and get out the chains." 

i was thinking, whoa, back up. wash the wagon? 
hang christmas lights? get out the chains? the chains?

or not, tonight had to be the night i got the truth from 
august.  the  thought  set  off  a  nervous  quiver  through 
me.  i  sat  down  on  the  cot  and  felt  things  building 
inside—pushing against my chest. 

heading  back  to  the  pink  house,  wearing  clean 
shorts  and  a  top,  my  hair  all  combed,  i  stopped  to  
behold  everything.  august,  june,  rosaleen,  zach,  neil, 
otis, and all the daughters of mary stood around on the 
mowed grass beside the card tables, their laughter low 
and  vibrating.  piles  of  food.  blue-and-white  streamers 
rippling  in  the  breezes.  the  christmas  lights  glowed  in 
spirals  of  color  around  the  porch,  and  all  the  candles
