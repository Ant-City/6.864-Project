some other one, who in a moment became visible; a figure somewhat
older than the school-girls, wearing a broad-brimmed hat and
highly-starched cambric morning-gown, with a couple of books in her
hand.

clare knew her well.  he could not be sure that she observed him; he
hoped she did not, so as to render it unnecessary that he should go
and speak to her, blameless creature that she was.  an overpowering
reluctance to greet her made him decide that she had not seen him.
the young lady was miss mercy chant, the only daughter of his
father's neighbour and friend, whom it was his parents' quiet hope
that he might wed some day.  she was great at antinomianism and
bible-classes, and was plainly going to hold a class now.  clare's
mind flew to the impassioned, summer-steeped heathens in the var
vale, their rosy faces court-patched with cow-droppings; and to one
the most impassioned of them all.

it was on the impulse of the moment that he had resolved to trot
over to emminster, and hence had not writt

"is she of a family such as you would care to marry into--a lady, in
short?" asked his startled mother, who had come softly into the study
during the conversation.

"she is not what in common parlance is called a lady," said angel,
unflinchingly, "for she is a cottager's daughter, as i am proud to
say.  but she is a lady, nevertheless--in feeling and nature."

"mercy chant is of a very good family."

"pooh!--what's the advantage of that, mother?" said angel quickly.
"how is family to avail the wife of a man who has to rough it as i
have, and shall have to do?"

"mercy is accomplished.  and accomplishments have their charm,"
returned his mother, looking at him through her silver spectacles.

"as to external accomplishments, what will be the use of them in the
life i am going to lead?--while as to her reading, i can take that
in hand.  she'll be apt pupil enough, a

at breakfast brazil was the topic, and all endeavoured to take a
hopeful view of clare's proposed experiment with that country's soil,
notwithstanding the discouraging reports of some farm-labourers who
had emigrated thither and returned home within the twelve months.
after breakfast clare went into the little town to wind up such
trifling matters as he was concerned with there, and to get from
the local bank all the money he possessed.  on his way back he
encountered miss mercy chant by the church, from whose walls she
seemed to be a sort of emanation.  she was carrying an armful of
bibles for her class, and such was her view of life that events which
produced heartache in others wrought beatific smiles upon her--an
enviable result, although, in the opinion of angel, it was obtained
by a curiously unnatural sacrifice of humanity to mysticism.

she had learnt that he was about to leave england, and observed what
an excellent and promising scheme it seemed to be.

"yes; it is

only one person had preceded tess up the hill--a ladylike young
woman, somewhat interesting, though, perhaps, a trifle _guind√©e_
and prudish.  tess had nearly overtaken her when the speed of her
brothers-in-law brought them so nearly behind her back that she could
hear every word of their conversation.  they said nothing, however,
which particularly interested her till, observing the young lady
still further in front, one of them remarked, "there is mercy chant.
let us overtake her."

tess knew the name.  it was the woman who had been destined for
angel's life-companion by his and her parents, and whom he probably
would have married but for her intrusive self.  she would have known
as much without previous information if she had waited a moment, for
one of the brothers proceeded to say: "ah! poor angel, poor angel!
i never see that nice girl without more and more regretting his
precipitancy in throwing himself away upon a dairymaid, or whatever

 plod back along the road by which she had come
not altogether full of hope, but full of a conviction that a crisis
in her life was approaching.  no crisis, apparently, had supervened;
and there was nothing left for her to do but to continue upon that
starve-acre farm till she could again summon courage to face the
vicarage.  she did, indeed, take sufficient interest in herself to
throw up her veil on this return journey, as if to let the world see
that she could at least exhibit a face such as mercy chant could
not show.  but it was done with a sorry shake of the head. "it is
nothing--it is nothing!" she said.  "nobody loves it; nobody sees it.
who cares about the looks of a castaway like me!"

her journey back was rather a meander than a march.  it had no
sprightliness, no purpose; only a tendency.  along the tedious length
of benvill lane she began to grow tired, and she leant upon gates and
paused by milestones.

she did not enter any house till, at the seventh or eighth mile, she

e, and, entering his hotel, sat down over the breakfast,
staring at nothingness.  he went on eating and drinking unconsciously
till on a sudden he demanded his bill; having paid which, he took his
dressing-bag in his hand, the only luggage he had brought with him,
and went out.

at the moment of his departure a telegram was handed to him--a few
words from his mother, stating that they were glad to know his
address, and informing him that his brother cuthbert had proposed to
and been accepted by mercy chant.

clare crumpled up the paper and followed the route to the station;
reaching it, he found that there would be no train leaving for an
hour and more.  he sat down to wait, and having waited a quarter of
an hour felt that he could wait there no longer.  broken in heart and
numbed, he had nothing to hurry for; but he wished to get out of a
town which had been the scene of such an experience, and turned to
walk to the first station onward, and let the train pick him up
there.
