t entered into his new calculations, he
could  predict  accurately  the  measured  energy  of  an  oven  for  any  selected  temperature.  this  one
parameter  is  the  proportionality  factor  between  the  frequency  of  a  wave  and  the  minimal  lump  of
energy it can have. planck found that this proportionality factor—now known as planck's  constant
and  denoted h  (pronounced  "h-bar")—is  about  a  billionth  of  a  billionth  of  a  billionth  in  everyday
units.4 the tiny value of planck's constant means that the size of the energy lumps are typically very
small. this is why, for example, it seems to us that we can cause the energy of a wave on a violin
string—and hence the volume of sound it produces—to change continuously. in reality, though, the
energy of the wave passes through discrete steps, a la planck, but the size of the steps is so small that
the discrete jumps from one volume to another appear to be smooth. according to planck's assertion,
the size of these jumps in energy

in  used  this  new  conception  to  suggest  a

microscopic  mechanism  underlying  the  photoelectric  effect: an  electron  is  knocked  off  a  metallic
surface, he proposed, if it gets hit by a sufficiently energetic photon. and what determines the energy
of  an  individual  photon?  to  explain  the  experimental  data,  einstein  followed  planck's  lead  and
proposed that the energy of each photon is proportional to the frequency of the light wave (with the
proportionality factor being planck's constant).

now, like the children's minimum departure fee, the electrons in a metal must be jostled by a
photon  posessing  a  certain  minimum  energy  in  order  to  be  kicked  off  the  surface.  (as  with  the
children fighting for money, it is extremely unlikely that any one electron gets hit by more than one
photon—most  don't  get  hit  at  all.)  but  if  the  impinging  light  beam's  frequency  is  too  low,  its
individual photons will lack the punch necessary to eject electrons. just as

 is  rendered  inconsistent  on  short  distance  (and  time)  scales.  the
central tenet of a smooth and gently curving geometry is justified in the large but breaks down due to
quantum fluctuations when pushed to the small.

the  basic  principles  of  general  relativity  and  quantum  mechanics  allow  us  to  calculate  the
approximate  distance  scales  below  which  one  would  have  to  shrink  in  order  for  the  pernicious
phenomenon of figure 5.1 to become apparent. the smallness of planck's constant—which governs
the strength of quantum effects—and the intrinsic weakness of the gravitational force team up to yield
a result called the planck length, which is small almost beyond imagination: a millionth of a billionth
of  a  billionth  of  a  billionth  of  a  centimeter  (10-33  centimeter).7  the  fifth  level  in  figure  5.1  thus
schematically  depicts  the  ultramicroscopic,  sub–planck  length  landscape  of  the  universe.  to  get  a
sense of scale, if we were to magnify an at

their  purported average  energy  contribution  (according  to  nineteenth-century  thermodynamics)  are
exponentially suppressed. this suppression is increasingly sharp as we examine waves of ever larger
frequency.
