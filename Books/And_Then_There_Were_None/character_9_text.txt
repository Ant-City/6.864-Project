crowd. 

oh, well, he supposed there'd be a few girls there... 



coming out of the hotel, he stretched himself, yawned, looked up at the blue sky 
and climbed into the dalmain. 

several young women looked at him admiringly - his six feet of well-proportioned 
body, his crisp hair, tanned face, and intensely blue eyes. 

he let in the clutch with a roar and leapt up the narrow street. old men and 
errand boys jumped for safety. the latter looked after the car admiringly. 

anthony marston proceeded on his triumphal progress.

mr. blore was in the slow train from plymouth. there was only one other person 
in his carriage, an elderly seafaring gentleman with a bleary eye. at the present 
moment he had dropped off to sleep. 

mr. blore was writing carefully in a little notebook. 



"that's the lot," he muttered to himself. "emily brent, vera claythorne, dr. 
armstrong, anthony marston, old justice wargrave, philip lombard, general 
macarthur, c.m.g., d.s.o. manservant

their guide paused, boat-hook in hand. 



down the steep track into the village a car was coming. a car so fantastically 
powerful, so superlatively beautiful that it had all the nature of an apparition. at 
the wheel sat a young man, his hair blown back by the wind. in the blaze of the 
evening light he looked, not a man, but a young god, a hero god out of some 
northern saga. 

he touched the horn and a great roar of sound echoed from the rocks of the bay. 

it was a fantastic moment. in it, anthony marston seemed to be something more 
than mortal. afterwards, more than one of those present remembered that 
moment.

fred narracott sat by the engine thinking to himself that this was a queer lot. 
not at all his idea of what mr. owen's guests were likely to be. he'd expected 
something altogether more classy. togged up women and gentlemen in yachting 
costume and all very rich and important looking.

party ascended the steps, and came out on a terrace above, their spirits 
revived. in the open doorway of the house a correct butler was awaiting them, 
and something about his gravity reassured them. and then the house itself was 
really most attractive, the view from the terrace magnificent... 

the butler came forward bowing slightly. he was a tall lank man, grey-haired 
and very respectable. he said: 

"will you come this way, please?" 

in the wide hall drinks stood ready. rows of bottles. anthony marston's spirits 
cheered up a little. he'd just been thinking this was a rum kind of show. none of 
his lot! what could old badger have been thinking about to let him in for this? 
however the drinks were all right. plenty of ice, too. 

what was it the butler chap was saying? 

"mr. owen - unfortunately delayed - unable to get here till tomorrow. 
instructions - everything they wanted - if they would like to go to their rooms?... 
dinner would be at 8 o'clock..."

rogers coming out on the terrace that minute, the judge asked him: 

"is lady constance culmington expected, do you know?" 

rogers stared at him. 

"no, sir, not to my knowledge." 

the judge's eyebrows rose. but he only grunted. 

he thought: 

"indian island, eh? there's a nigger in the woodpile."

anthony marston was in his bath. he luxuriated in the steaming water. his 
limbs had felt cramped after his long drive. very few thoughts passed through 
his head. anthony was a creature of sensation - and of action. 



he thought to himself: 



"must go through with it, i suppose," and thereafter dismissed everything from 
his mind. 

warm steaming water - tired limbs - presently a shave - a cocktail - dinner. 

and after -?

mr. blore was tying his tie. he wasn't very good at this sort of thing.

caustic fashion; dr. armstrong and tony marston were listening to him. miss 
brent chatted to general macarthur; they had discovered some mutual friends. 
vera claythorne was asking mr. davis intelligent questions about south africa. 
mr. davis was quite fluent on the subject. lombard listened to the conversation. 



once or twice he looked up quickly, and his eyes narrowed. now and then his 
eyes played round the table, studying the others. 

anthony marston said suddenly: 

"quaint, these things, aren't they?" 

in the centre of the round table, on a circular glass stand, were some little china 
figures. 

"indians." said tony. "indian island. i suppose that's the idea." 

vera leaned forward. 

"i wonder. how many are there? ten?" 

"yes - ten there are." 

vera cried: 

"what fun! they're the ten little indian boys of the nursery rhyme, i suppose. in 
my bedroom the rhyme is framed and hung up over the mantelpiece." 

lombard said:

lombard obeyed. 

dr. armstrong said, with a sigh of relief: 



"a disgraceful and heartless practical joke, i suppose." 

the small clear voice of mr. justice wargrave murmured: 

"so you think it's a joke, do you?" 

the doctor stared at him. 

"what else could it be?" 

the hand of the judge gently stroked his upper lip. 

he said: 

"at the moment i'm not prepared to give an opinion." 

anthony marston broke in. he said: 

"look here, there's one thing you've forgotten. who the devil turned the thing on 
and set it going?" 

wargrave murmured: 

"yes, i think we must inquire into that." 

he led the way back into the drawing-room. the others followed. 

rogers had just come in with a glass of brandy. miss brent was bending over the 
moaning form of mrs. rogers. 



adroitly rogers slipped between the two women.

he said:

he twitched it out of the other's hand, and ran his eye over it. 

he murmured: 

"coronation machine. quite new - no defects. ensign paper - the most widely 
used make. you won't get anything out of that. might be fingerprints, but i doubt

wargrave stared at him with sudden attention. 

anthony marston was standing beside blore looking over his shoulder. he said: 

"got some fancy christian names, hasn't he? ulick norman owen. quite a 
mouthful." 

"the old judge said with a slight start: 

"i am obliged to you, mr. marston. you have drawn my attention to a curious and 
suggestive point."

mr. blore, but in addition i've noticed this evening that you're a first-class liar. 
you claim to have come from natal, south africa. i know south africa and natal 
and i'm prepared to swear that you've never set foot in south africa in your life." 

all eyes were turned on blore. angry suspicious eyes. anthony marston moved a 
step nearer to him. his fists clenched themselves. 

"now then, you swine," he said. "any explanation?" 

blore flung back his head and set his square jaw. 

"you gentlemen have got me wrong," he said. "i've got my credentials and you 
can see them. i'm an ex-c.i.d. man. i run a detective agency in plymouth. i was

mr. justice wargrave asked: "by whom?"

he paused. then he said: 

"he knows, you see, a good deal. and out of his knowledge concerning us, he has 
made certain definite accusations." 

immediately a babel broke out. 

general macarthur shouted: 

"a pack of damn lies! slander!" 

vera cried out: 

"it's iniquitous!" her breath came fast. "wicked!" 



rogers said hoarsely: 

"a lie - a wicked lie... we never did - neither of us..." 

anthony marston growled: 

"don't know what the damned fool was getting at!" 

the upraised hand of mr. justice wargrave calmed the tumult. 

he said, picking his words with care: 

"i wish to say this. our unknown friend accuses me of the murder of one edward 
seton. i remember seton perfectly well. he came up before me for trial in june of 
the year 1930. he was charged with the murder of an elderly woman. he was 
very ably defended and made a good impression on the jury in the witness box.

general macarthur said sternly:

lombard said: 



"not quite the act of a pukka sahib, i'm afraid. but self-preservation's a man's 
first duty. and natives don't mind dying, you know. they don't feel about it as 
europeans do." 

vera lifted her face from her hands. she said, staring at him: 

"you left them - to die?" 

lombard answered: 

"i left them to die." 

his amused eyes looked into her horrified ones. 

anthony marston said in a slow puzzled voice: 

"i've just been thinking - john and lucy combes. must have been a couple of kids 
i ran over near cambridge. beastly bad luck." 

mr. justice wargrave said acidly: 

"for them, or for you?" 

anthony said: 



"well, i was thinking - for me - but of course, you're right, sir, it was damned bad 
luck on them. of course it was a pure accident. they rushed out of some cottage 
or other. i had my licence endorsed for a year. beastly nuisance."

when he raised his head his eyes were bewildered. 

he said in a low awe-struck whisper: 

"my god! he's dead!" 

they didn't take it in. not at once. 

dead? dead? that young norse god in the prime of his health and strength. 
struck down all in a moment. healthy young men didn't die like that, choking 
over a whiskey and soda... 

no, they couldn't take it in. 

dr. armstrong was peering into the dead man's face. he sniffed at the blue 
twisted lips. then he picked up the glass from which anthony marston had been 
drinking. 

general macarthur said: 

"dead: d'you mean the fellow just choked and - and died?" 

the physician said: 



"you can call it choking if you like. he died of asphyxiation right enough." 

he was sniffing now at the glass. he dipped a finger into the dregs and very 
cautiously just touched the finger with the tip of his tongue. 

his expression altered. 

general macarthur said: 

"never knew a man could die like that -just of a choking fit!"

armstrong nodded with a curiously dissatisfied expression. he said:

blore said:

"you'd never think that he would kill himself. he was so alive. he was - oh

he looked - oh, i can't explain!" 



but they knew what she meant. anthony marston, in the height of his youth and 
manhood, had seemed like a being who was immortal. and now, crumpled and 
broken, he lay on the floor. 

dr. armstrong said: 

"is there any possibility other than suicide?" 

slowly every one shook his head. there could be no other explanation. the drinks 
themselves were untampered with. they had all seen anthony marston go across 
and help himself. it followed therefore that any cyanide in the drink must have 
been put there by anthony marston himself. 

and

was a suicidal type of gentleman." 

armstrong answered: 

i agree.

they had left it like that. what else was there to say? 

together armstrong and lombard had carried the inert body of anthony 
marston to his bedroom and had laid him there covered over with a sheet. 



when they came downstairs again, the others were standing in a group,

"it s too far, cyril." 

"but, miss claythorne..." 

vera got up. she went to the dressing-table and swallowed three aspirins. 

she thought: 

"i wish i had some proper sleeping stuff." 

she thought: 

"if i were doing away with myself i'd take an overdose of veronal - something like 
that - not cyanide!" 

she shuddered as she remembered anthony marston's convulsed purple face. 

as she passed the mantelpiece, she looked up at the framed doggerel. 



ten little indian boys went out to dine; 

one choked his little self and then there were nine. 



she thought to herself: 

"it's horrible -just like us this evening..." 

why had anthony marston wanted to die? 

she didn't want to die. 

she couldn't imagine wanting to die... 

death was for - the other people...

how malicious her eyes were! her lips were moving. what was she saying? 

"in the midst of life we are in death..." 

she was laughing now. no, nurse, don't put the handkerchief back. i've got to 
see. i've got to give the anaesthetic. where's the ether? i must have brought the 
ether with me. what have you done with the ether, sister? chbteau neuf du 
pape? yes, that will do quite as well. 

take the handkerchief away, nurse. 



of course! i knew it all the time! it's anthony marston! his face is purple and 
convulsed. but he's not dead - he's laughing. i tell you he's laughing! he's 
shaking the operating table. 

look out, man, look out. nurse, steady it - steady - it - 

with a start dr. armstrong woke up. it was morning. sunlight was pouring into 
the room. 

and some one was leaning over him - shaking him. it was rogers. rogers, with a 
white face, saying: "doctor - doctor!" 

dr. armstrong woke up completely. 

he sat up in bed. he said sharply:

possibility: she lost her nerve and took an easy way out herself." 

philip lombard said: 

"suicide, eh?" 

"what do you say to that?" 

lombard said: 

"it could have been - yes - if it hadn't been for marston's death. two suicides 
within twelve hours is a little too much to swallow! and if you tell me that 
anthony marston, a young bull with no nerves and precious little brains, got the 
wind up over having mowed down a couple of kids and deliberately put himself 
out of the way - well, the idea's laughable! and anyway, how did he get hold of 
the stuff? from all i've ever heard, potassium cyanide isn't the kind of stuff you 
take about with you in your waistcoat pocket. but that's your line of country." 

armstrong said: 

"nobody in their senses carries potassium cyanide. it might be done by some one

"the ardent gardener or landowner, in fact? again, not anthony marston. it 
strikes me that cyanide is going to need a bit of explaining. either anthony 
marston meant to do away with himself before he came here, and therefore came 
prepared - or else -" 



armstrong prompted him. 



'or else?" 



philip lombard grinned. 



"why make me say it? when it's on the tip of your own tongue. anthony marston 
was murdered, of course." 



ill 

dr. armstrong drew a deep breath. 

"and mrs. rogers?" 

lombard said slowly: 

"i could believe in anthony's suicide (with difficulty) if it weren't for mrs. rogers. 
i could believe in mrs. rogers' suicide (easily) if it weren't for anthony marston. i 
can believe that rogers put his wife out of the way - if it were not for the 
unexplained death of anthony marston. but what we need is a theory to explain 
two deaths following rapidly on each other."

"nine little indian boys sat up very late;

the two men looked at each other. philip lombard grinned and flung away his 
cigarette.

vengeance."

chapter 9 



lombard said slowly: 



"so we've been wrong - wrong all along! built up a nightmare of superstition and 
fantasy all because of the coincidence of two deaths!" 



armstrong said gravely: 

"and yet, you know, the argument holds. hang it all, i'm a doctor, i know 
something about suicides. anthony marston wasn't a suicidal type." 

lombard said doubtfully: 

"it couldn't, i suppose, have been an accident?" 

blore snorted, unconvinced. 

"damned queer sort of accident," he grunted. 

there was a pause, then blore said: 

"about the woman -" and stopped. 

"mrs. rogers?" 

"yes. it's possible, isn't it, that that might have been an accident?"

blore looked slightly embarrassed. his red-brick face grew a little deeper in hue.

clearing his throat, he once more spoke. 

"this morning, gentlemen, whilst i was sitting on the terrace. i was an observer 
of your activities. there could be little doubt of your purpose. you were searching 
the island for an unknown murderer?" 

"quite right, sir," said philip lombard. 

the judge went on. 



"you had come, doubtless, to the same conclusion that i had - namely that the 
deaths of anthony marston and mrs. rogers were neither accidental nor were 
they suicides. no doubt you also reached a certain conclusion as to the purpose of 
mr. owen in enticing us to this island?" 

blore said hoarsely: 

"he's a madman! a loony." 

the judge coughed. 

"that almost certainly. but it hardly affects the issue. our main preoccupation is 
this - to save our lives." 

armstrong said in a trembling voice: 

"there's no one on the island, i tell you. no one!" 

the judge stroked his jaw.

lombard said: 

"well, have it your own way, u.n. owen is one of us. no exceptions allowed. we 
all qualify." 

mr. justice wargrave said: 

"my point is that there can be no exceptions allowed on the score of character, 
position, or probability. what we must now examine is the possibility of 
eliminating one or more persons on the facts. to put it simply, is there among us 
one or more persons who could not possibly have administered either cyanide to 
anthony marston, or an overdose of sleeping draught to mrs. rogers, and who 
had no opportunity of striking the blow that killed general macarthur?" 

blore's rather heavy face lit up. he leant forward. 



"now you're talking, sir!" he said. "that's the stuff! let's go into it. as regards

the candle was burning down. looking to see if the matches were within easy 
reach of his hand, he blew it out. 

strangely enough, he found the darkness disquieting. it was as though a 
thousand age-old fears awoke and struggled for supremacy in his brain. faces 
floated in the air - the judge's face crowned with that mockery of grey wool - the 
cold dead face of mrs. rogers - the convulsed purple face of anthony marston... 

another face - pale, spectacled, with a small straw-coloured moustache... 



a face he had seen sometime or other - but when? not on the island. no, much 
longer ago than that. 

funny, that he couldn't put a name to it... silly sort of face really - fellow looked a 
bit of a mug. 

of course! 

it came to him with a real shock.

where the sister in question had trained, etc., soon gave me the necessary data. i 
tracked down the doctor and the patient mentioned without difficulty. 

a conversation between two old military gossips in my club put me on the track 
of general macarthur. a man who had recently returned from the amazon gave 
me a devastating resume of the activities of one philip lombard. an indignant 
mem sahib in majorca recounted the tale of the puritan emily brent and her 
wretched servant girl. anthony marston i selected from a large group of people 
who had committed similar offences. his complete callousness and his inability to 
feel any responsibility for the lives he had taken made him, i considered, a type 
dangerous to the community and unfit to live. ex-inspector blore came my way 
quite naturally, some of my professional brethren discussing the landor case 
with freedom and vigour. i took a serious view of his offence. the police, as 
servants of the law, must be of a high order of integrity

ingly - the man was a 
slight hypochondriac. i had no fear that he would leave any compromising 
documents or memoranda behind. he was not that sort of man. 

the order of death upon the island had been subjected by me to special thought 
and care. there were, i considered, amongst my guests, varying degrees of guilt. 
those whose guilt was the lightest should, i decided, pass out first, and not suffer 
the prolonged mental strain and fear that the more cold-blooded offenders were 
to suffer. 

anthony marston and mrs. rogers died first, the one instantaneously, the other 
in a peaceful sleep. marston, i recognized, was a type born without that feeling of 
moral responsibility which most of us have. he was amoral - pagan. mrs. rogers, 
i had no doubt, had acted very largely under the influence of her husband. 



i need not describe closely how those two met their deaths. the police will have 
been able to work that out quite easily. potassium cyanide is easily obtained by 
householders for putting d
