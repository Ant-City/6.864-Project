[CHARACTER]
the protagonist and narrator of the sovereignty and goodness of
god is a middle-aged wife and mother of three children. though she
was born in england, she has lived in the american colonies for nearly four
decades and has lived in the frontier settlement of lancaster for more than
twenty years. married to a minister, she is pious, and her christian faith, like
that of other puritans, plays a central role in her life. rowlandson believes
god plays an active role in people's lives, showing his grace in the form of
safety and well-being and expressing his disapproval by plaguing people with
misfortunes or tragedy. when confronted with a disastrous indian attack,
rowlandson questions her conception of herself and her society. she is certain
that such an attack must have happened for a reason, and, taken captive and
unsure if she will survive, she seeks to uncover that reason.

in her search for understanding, she turns to christianity and finds
meaning and comfort in the bible. like other puritans, she projects the
struggles that occur in the bible and in her own psyche onto the landscape
around her. america often seems to be a new eden, but the landscape and its
native inhabitants also seem connected to hell and the devil. rowlandson casts
herself alternately as job (whose suffering is a test of his faith) and as one
of the israelites fated to wander in the wilderness (whose trials are brought
upon them as punishment for their own failings). rowlandson has a great fear of
devolving to savagery--of "backsliding" religiously and socially--a fear that
appears in other puritan writings as well.
