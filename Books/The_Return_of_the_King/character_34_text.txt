‘where are we, gandalf?’ he asked.
‘in the realm of gondor,’ the wizard answered. ‘the land of anórien is still passing by.’
there was a silence again for a while. then, ‘what is that?’ cried pippin suddenly, clutching at gandalf’s cloak. ‘look! fire, red fire! are there dragons in this land? look, there is another!’
for answer gandalf cried aloud to his horse. ‘on, shadowfax! we must hasten. time is short. see! the beacons of gondor are alight, calling for aid. war is kindled. see, there is the fire on amon dîn, and flame on eilenach; and there they go speeding west: nardol, erelas, min-rimmon, calenhad, and the halifirien on the borders of rohan.’
but shadowfax paused in his stride, slowing to a walk, and then he lifted up his head and neighed. and out of the darkness the answering neigh of other horses came; and presently the thudding of hoofs was heard, and t

hree riders swept up and passed like flying ghosts in the moon and vanished into the west. then shadowfax gathered himself together and sprang away, and the night flowed over him like a roaring wind.
pippin became drowsy again and paid little attention to gandalf telling him of the customs of gondor, and how the lord of the city had beacons built on the tops of outlying hills along both borders of the great range, and maintained posts at these points where fresh horses were always in readiness to bear his errand-riders to rohan in the north, or to belfalas in the south. ‘it is long since the beac

igh white peaks, glimmering like floating isles above the clouds as they caught the light of the westering moon. he wondered where frodo was, and if he was already in mordor, or if he was dead; and he did not know that frodo from far away looked on that same moon as it set beyond gondor ere the coming of the day.
pippin woke to the sound of voices. another day of hiding and a night of journey had fleeted by. it was twilight: the cold dawn was at hand again, and chill grey mists were about them. shadowfax stood steaming with sweat, but he held his neck proudly and showed no sign of weariness. many tall men heavily cloaked stood beside him, and behind them in the mist loomed a wall of stone. partly ruinous it seemed, but already before the night was passed the sound of hurried labour could be heard: beat of hammers, clink of trowels, and the creak of wheels. torches and flares glowed dully here and there in the fog. gandalf was speaking to the men that barred his way, and as he listened pippin be

then men fell back before the command of his voice and questioned him no further, though they gazed in wonder at the hobbit that sat before him and at the horse that bore him. for the people of the city used horses very little and they were seldom seen in their streets, save only those ridden by the errand-riders of their lord. and they said: ‘surely that is one of the great steeds of the king of rohan? maybe the rohirrim will come soon to strengthen us.’ but shadowfax walked proudly up the long winding road.
for the fashion of minas tirith was such that it was built on seven levels, each delved into the hill, and about each was set a wall, and in each wall was a gate. but the gates were not set in a line: the great gate in the city wall was at the east point of the circuit, but the next faced half south, and the third half north, and so to and fro upwards; so that the paved way that climbed towards the citadel turned first this way and then that across the f

ey were silent, and no footsteps rang on their wide pavements, nor voice was heard in their halls, nor any face looked out from door or empty window.
at last they came out of shadow to the seventh gate, and the warm sun that shone down beyond the river, as frodo walked in the glades of ithilien, glowed here on the smooth walls and rooted pillars, and the great arch with keystone carven in the likeness of a crowned and kingly head. gandalf dismounted, for no horse was allowed in the citadel, and shadowfax suffered himself to be led away at the soft word of his master.
the guards of the gate were robed in black, and their helms were of strange shape, high-crowned, with long cheek-guards close-fitting to the face, and above the cheek-guards were set the white wings of sea-birds; but the helms gleamed with a flame of silver, for they were indeed wrought of mithril, heirlooms from the glory of old days. upon the black surcoats were embroidered in white a tree blossoming like snow beneath a silver cr

gandalf went to the door, and there he turned. ‘i am in haste pippin,’ he said. ‘do me a favour when you go out. even before you rest, if you are not too weary. go and find shadowfax and see how he is housed. these people are kindly to beasts, for they are a good and wise folk, but they have less skill with horses than some.’
with that gandalf went out; and as he did so, there came the note of a clear sweet bell ringing in a tower of the citadel. three strokes it rang, like silver in the air, and ceased: the third hour from the rising of the sun.
after a minute pippin went to the door and down the stair and looked about the street. the sun was now shining warm and bright,

‘come! we will walk a little and then go find us some refreshment, and eat and drink on the battlement, and survey the fair morning.’
‘one moment!’ said pippin blushing. ‘greed, or hunger by your courtesy, put it out of my mind. but gandalf, mithrandir as you call him, asked me to see to his horse - shadowfax, a great steed of rohan, and the apple of the king’s eye, i am told, though he has given him to mithrandir for his services. i think his new master loves the beast better than he loves many men, and if his good will is of any value to this city, you will treat shadowfax with all honour: with greater kindness than you have treated this hobbit, if it is possible.’
‘hobbit?’ said beregond.
‘that is what we call ourselves,’ said pippin.
‘i am glad to learn it,’ said beregond, ‘for

 now i may say that strange accents do not mar fair speech, and hobbits are a fair-spoken folk. but come! you shall make me acquainted with this good horse. i love beasts, and we see them seldom in this stony city; for my people came from the mountain-vales, and before that from ithilien. but fear not! the visit shall be short, a mere call of courtesy, and we will go thence to the butteries.’
pippin found that shadowfax had been well housed and tended. for in the sixth circle, outside the walls of the citadel, there were some fair stables where a few swift horses were kept, hard by the lodgings of the errand-riders of the lord: messengers always ready to go at the urgent command of denethor or his chief captains. but now all the horses and the riders were out and away.
shadowfax whinnied as pippin entered the stable and turned his head. ‘good morning!’ said pippin. ‘gandalf will come as soon as he may. h

shadowfax tossed his head and stamped. but he allowed beregond to handle his head gently and stroke his great flanks.
‘he looks as if he were spoiling for a race, and not newly come from a great journey,’ said beregond. ‘how strong and proud he is! where is his harness? it should be rich and fair.’
‘none is rich and fair enough for him,’ said pippin. ‘he will have none. if he will consent to bear you, bear you he does; and if not, well, no bit, bridle, whip, or thong will tame him. farewell

shadowfax lifted up his head and neighed, so that the stable shook, and they covered their ears. then they took their leave, seeing that the manger was well filled.
‘and now for our manger,’ said beregond, and he led pippin back to the citadel, and so to a door in the north side of the great tower. there they went down a long cool stair into a wide alley lit with lamps. there were hatches in the walls at the side, and one of these was open.
‘this is the storehouse and buttery of my company of the g

he went out, and soon after all the others followed. the day was still fine, though it was growing hazy, and it was hot for march, even so far southwards. pippin felt sleepy, but the lodging seemed cheerless, and he decided to go down and explore the city. he took a few morsels that he had saved to shadowfax, and they were graciously accepted, though the horse seemed to have no lack. then he walked on down many winding ways.
people stared much as he passed. to his face men were gravely courteous, saluting him after the manner of gondor with bowed head and hands upon the breast; but behind him he heard many calls, as those out of doors cried to others within to come and see the prince of the halflings, the companion of mithrandir. many used some other tongue than the common speech, but it was not lo

‘but the night will be too short,’ said gandalf. ‘i have come back here, for i must have a little peace, alone. you should sleep, in a bed while you still may. at the sunrise i shall take you to the lord denethor again. no, when the summons comes, not at sunrise. the darkness has begun. there will be no dawn.’

chapter 2

the passing of the grey company

gandalf was gone, and the thudding hoofs of shadowfax were lost in the night, when merry came back to aragorn. he had only a light bundle, for he had lost his pack at parth galen, and all he had was a few useful things he had picked up among the wreckage of isengard. hasufel was already saddled. legolas and gimli with their horse stood close by.
‘so four of the company still remain,’ said aragorn. ‘we will ride on together. but we shall not go alone, as i thought. the king is now determined to set out at once. since the coming of the winged

so the king of the mark came back victorious out of the west to dunharrow beneath the feet of the white mountains. there he found the remaining strength of his people already assembled; for as soon as his coming was known captains rode to meet him at the ford, bearing messages from gandalf. dúnhere, chieftain of the folk of harrowdale, was at their head.
‘at dawn three days ago, lord,’ he said. ‘shadowfax came like a wind out of the west to edoras, and gandalf brought tidings of your victory to gladden our hearts. but he brought also word from you to hasten the gathering of the riders. and then came the winged shadow.’
‘the winged shadow?’ said théoden. ‘we saw it also, but that was in the dead of night before gandalf left us.’
‘maybe, lord,’ said dúnhere. ‘yet the same, or another like to it, a flying darkness in the shape of a monstrous bird, passed over edoras that morning,

ho had watched the race and the rescue from the high walls.
it was not long before a clamour was heard in the streets leading up from the outer circles, and there was much cheering and crying of the names of faramir and mithrandir. presently pippin saw torches, and followed by a press of people two horsemen riding slowly: one was in white but shining no longer, pale in the twilight as if his fire was spent or veiled; the other was dark and his head was bowed. they dismounted, and as grooms took shadowfax and the other horse, they walked forward to the sentinel at the gate: gandalf steadily, his grey cloak flung back, and a fire still smouldering in his eyes; the other, clad all in green, slowly, swaying a little as a weary or a wounded man.
pippin pressed forward as they passed under the lamp beneath the gate-arch, and when he saw the pale face of faramir he caught his breath. it was the face of one who has been assailed by a great fear or anguish, but has mastered it and now is quiet. proud an

gnal: all the mounted men that were left in the city. now they sprang forward, formed, quickened to a gallop, and charged with a great shout. and from the walls an answering shout went up; for foremost on the field rode the swan-knights of dol amroth with their prince and his blue banner at their head.
‘amroth for gondor!’ they cried. ‘amroth to faramir!’
like thunder they broke upon the enemy on either flank of the retreat; but one rider outran them all, swift as the wind in the grass: shadowfax bore him, shining, unveiled once more, a light starting from his upraised hand.
the nazgûl screeched and swept away, for their captain was not yet come to challenge the white fire of his foe. the hosts of morgul intent on their prey, taken at unawares in wild career, broke, scattering like sparks in a gale. the out-companies with a great cheer turned and smote their pursuers. hunters became the hunted. the retreat became an onslaught. the field was strewn with stricken orcs and men, and a reek

ndor broke. as if stricken by some blasting spell it burst asunder: there was a flash of searing lightning, and the doors tumbled in riven fragments to the ground.
in rode the lord of the nazgûl. a great black shape against the fires beyond he loomed up, grown to a vast menace of despair. in rode the lord of the nazgûl, under the archway that no enemy ever yet had passed, and all fled before his face.
all save one. there waiting, silent and still in the space before the gate, sat gandalf upon shadowfax: shadowfax who alone among the free horses of the earth endured the terror, unmoving, steadfast as a graven image in rath dínen.
‘you cannot enter here,’ said gandalf, and the huge shadow halted. ‘go back to the abyss prepared for you! go back! fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your master. go!’
the black rider flung back his hood, and behold! he had a kingly crown; and yet upon no head visible was it set. the red fires shone between it and the mantled shoulders vast and da

the pyre of denethor

when the dark shadow at the gate withdrew gandalf still sat motionless. but pippin rose to his feet, as if a great weight had been lifted from him; and he stood listening to the horns, and it seemed to him that they would break his heart with joy. and never in after years could he hear a horn blown in the distance without tears starting in his eyes. but now suddenly his errand returned to his memory, and he ran forward. at that moment gandalf stirred and spoke to shadowfax, and was about to ride through the gate.
‘gandalf, gandalf! ‘ cried pippin, and shadowfax halted.
‘what are you doing here?’ said gandalf. ‘is it not a law in the city that those who wear the black and silver must stay in the citadel, unless their lord gives them leave?’
‘he has,’ said pippin. ‘he sent me away. but i am frightened. something terrible may happen up there. the lord is out of his mind, i think. i am afraid he will kill himself, and kill faramir too. can’t you d

 out his tale, reaching up and touching gandalf’s knee with trembling hands. ‘can’t you save faramir?’
‘maybe i can,’ said gandalf; ‘but if i do, then others will die, i fear. well, i must come, since no other help can reach him. but evil and sorrow will come of this. even in the heart of our stronghold the enemy has power to strike us: for his will it is that is at work.’
then having made up his mind he acted swiftly; and catching up pippin and setting him before him, he turned shadowfax with a word. up the climbing streets of minas tirith they clattered, while the noise of war rose behind them. everywhere men were rising from their despair and dread, seizing their weapons, crying one to another: ‘rohan has come!’ captains were shouting, companies were mustering; many already were marching down to the gate.
they met the prince imrahil, and he called to them: ‘whither now, mithrandir? the rohirrim are fighting on the fields of gondor! we must gather all the strength that w

ness is passing,’ said gandalf, ‘but it still lies heavy on this city.’
at the gate of the citadel they found no guard. ‘then beregond has gone,’ said pippin more hopefully. they turned away and hastened along the road to the closed door. it stood wide open, and the porter lay before it. he was slain and his key had been taken.
‘work of the enemy!’ said gandalf. ‘such deeds he loves: friend at war with friend; loyalty divided in confusion of hearts.’ now he dismounted and bade shadowfax return to his stable. ‘for, my friend,’ he said, ‘you and i should have ridden to the fields long ago, but other matters delay me. yet come swiftly if i call!’
they passed the door and walked on down the steep winding road. light was growing, and the tall columns and carven figures beside the way went slowly by like grey ghosts.
suddenly the silence was broken, and they heard below them cries and the ringing of swords: such sounds as had not been heard in the hallowed places since the b

‘wholesome verily,’ said aragorn. ‘and now, dame, if you love the lord faramir, run as quick as your tongue and get me kingsfoil, if there is a leaf in the city.’
‘and if not,’ said gandalf, ‘i will ride to lossarnach with ioreth behind me, and she shall take me to the woods, but not to her sisters. and shadowfax shall show her the meaning of haste.’
when ioreth was gone, aragorn bade the other women to make water hot. then he took faramir's hand in his, and laid the other hand upon the sick man’s brow. it was drenched with sweat; but faramir did not move or make any sign, and seemed hardly to breathe.
‘he is nearly spent,’ said aragorn turning to gandalf. ‘but this comes not from the wound. see! that is healing. had he been smitten by some dart of the nazgûl, as you thought, he would have di

 rohan went to the hallows and they came to the tombs in rath dínen, and they bore away king théoden upon a golden bier, and passed through the city in silence. then they laid the bier upon a great wain with riders of rohan all about it and his banner borne before; and merry being théoden’s esquire rode upon the wain and kept the arms of the king.
for the other companions steeds were furnished according to their stature; and frodo and samwise rode at aragorn’s side, and gandalf rode upon shadowfax, and pippin rode with the knights of gondor; and legolas and gimli as ever rode together upon arod.
in that riding went also queen arwen, and celeborn and galadriel with their folk, and elrond and his sons; and the princes of dol amroth and of ithilien, and many captains and knights. never had any king of the mark such company upon the road as went with théoden thengel’s son to the land of his home.

‘but there aren’t any gates,’ said merry, ‘not on the road; you know that quite well. there’s the buckland gate, of course; but they’ll let me through that at any time.’
‘there weren’t any gates, you mean,’ said gandalf. ‘i think you will find some now. and you might have more trouble even at the buckland gate than you think. but you’ll! manage all right. good-bye dear friends! not for the last time, not yet. good-bye!’
he turned shadowfax off the road, and the great horse leaped the green dike that here ran beside it; and then at a cry from gandalf he was gone, racing towards the barrow-downs like a wind from the north.
‘well here we are, just the four of us that started out together,’ said merry. ‘we have left all the rest behind, one after another. it seems almost like a dream that has slowly faded.’
‘not to me,’ said frodo. ‘to me it feels more like falling asleep again.’
