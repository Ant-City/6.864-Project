[CHARACTER]

the oldest of the compson children, quentin feels an inordinate burden
of responsibility to live up to the family's past greatness and prestige.
he is a very intelligent and sensitive young man, but is paralyzed
by his obsession with caddy and his preoccupation with a very traditional
southern code of conduct and morality. this southern code defines
order and chaos within quentin's world, and causes him to idealize
nebulous, abstract concepts such as honor, virtue, and feminine
purity. his strict belief in this code causes quentin profound despair
when he learns of caddy's promiscuity. turning to mr. compson for
guidance, quentin feels even worse when he learns that his father
does not care about the southern code or the shame caddy's conduct
has brought on the family. when quentin finds that his sister and
father have disregarded the code that gives order and meaning to
his life, he is driven to despondency and eventually suicide.
	quentin's southern code also prevents him from being
a man of action. the code preoccupies quentin with blind devotion
to abstract concepts that he is never able to act upon assertively
or effectively. quentin is full of vague ideas, such as the suicide
pact with caddy or the desire for revenge against dalton ames, but
his ideas are always unspecific and inevitably end up either rejected
by others or carried out ineffectively. quentin's focus on ideas
over deeds makes him a highly unreliable narrator, as it is often
difficult to tell which of the actions he describes have actually
occurred and which are mere fantasy.
