and with the ostent of war will look so huge,

they do abuse the king that flatter him:
for flattery is the bellows blows up sin;
the thing the which is flatter'd, but a spark,
to which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing:
whereas reproof, obedient and in order,
fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.

pericles.
thou speak'st like a physician, helicanus,
that minister'st a potion unto me
that thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.
attend me, then: i went to antioch,
and there as thou know'st, against the face of death,
i sought the purchase of a glorious beauty,
from whence an issue i might propagate,
are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.
her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;
the rest -- hark in thine ear -- as black as incest:
which by my knowledge found, the sinful father

and should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,

how many worthy princes' bloods were shed,

to lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms,

must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:

drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,
musings into my mind, with thousand doubts
how i might stop this tempest ere it came;
and finding little comfort to relieve them,
i thought it princely charity to grieve them.

helicanus.
well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak,
freely will i speak. antiochus you fear,
and justly too, i think, you fear the tyrant,
who either by public war or private treason
will take away your life.

pericles; and if i do it not, i am sure to be hanged at home:
'tis dangerous.  well, i perceive he was a wise fellow, and
had good discretion, that, being bid to ask what he would of
the king, desired he might know none of his secrets: now do i
see he had some reason for 't; for if a king bid a man be a
villain, he's bound by the indenture of his oath to be one.
hush! here come the lords of tyre.

[enter helicanus and escanes, with other lords of tyre.]

helicanus.

doth speak sufficiently he 's gone to travel.

with whom each minute threatens life or death.

in antiochus and his daughter you have heard
of monstrous lust the due and just reward:
in pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,
although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,
virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last:
in helicanus may you well descry
a figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:
in reverend cerimon there well appears
the worth that learned charity aye wears:
for wicked cleon and his wife, when fame
had spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name
of pericles, to rage the city turn,
that him and his they in his palace burn;
the gods for murder seemed so content
to punish them although not done but meant.
so, on your patence evermore attending,
new joy wait on you! here our play has ending.
