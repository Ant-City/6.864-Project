€”is edy boardman your sweetheart? cissy queried.

â€”nao, tommy said.

â€”i know, edy boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her
shortsighted eyes. i know who is tommyâ€™s sweetheart. gerty is tommyâ€™s
sweetheart.

â€”nao, tommy said on the verge of tears.

cissyâ€™s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to
edy boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman
couldnâ€™t see and to mind he didnâ€™t wet his new tan shoes.

but who was gerty?

gerty macdowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought,
gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen
of winsome irish girlhood as one could wish to see. she was pronounced
beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was
more a giltrap than a macdowell. her figure was slight and graceful,
inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking
of late had done her a world of good much better than the widow welchâ€™s

she did that it was her that told her or sheâ€™d never speak to her
again. no. honour where honour is due. there was an innate refinement, a
languid queenly hauteur about gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in
her delicate hands and higharched instep. had kind fate but willed her
to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she
only received the benefit of a good education gerty macdowell might
easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen
herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors
at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her.
mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her
softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning,
that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm
few could resist. why have women such eyes of witchery? gertyâ€™s were of

would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. she did it up all by
herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the
lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! and when she put
it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the
shine out of some people she knew. her shoes were the newest thing in
footwear (edy boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she
never had a foot like gerty macdowell, a five, and never would ash,
oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over
her higharched instep. her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect
proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of
her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and
wide garter tops. as for undies they were gertyâ€™s chief care and who
that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though
gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his

and yet and yet! that strained look on her face! a gnawing sorrow is
there all the time. her very soul is in her eyes and she would give
worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving
way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings
though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the
mirror. you are lovely, gerty, it said. the paly light of evening falls
upon a face infinitely sad and wistful. gerty macdowell yearns in vain.

hereâ€™s the lord mayor, hereâ€™s his two horses, hereâ€™s his gingerbread
carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper
chin. but edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way
like that from everyone always petting him.

â€”iâ€™d like to give him something, she said, so i would, where i wonâ€™t
say.

â€”on the beeoteetom, laughed cissy merrily.

gerty macdowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of cissy
saying an unladylike thing like that out loud sheâ€™d be ashamed of her
life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and edy boardman said she was
sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. but not a pin cared
ciss.

â€”let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of
her nose. give it to him too on the same place as quick as iâ€™d look at
him.

il try again, edy boardman said.

gerty smiled assent and bit her lip. a delicate pink crept into her
pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted
her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a
jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down
towards the shingle. pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw
attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. she felt the
warm flush, a danger signal always with gerty macdowell, surging and
flaming into her cheeks. till then they had only exchanged glances of
the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a
look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan
and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.

through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted
and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of

half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged
on tears, and then they parted.

slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to cissy,
to edy to jacky and tommy caffrey, to little baby boardman. it was
darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and
slippy seaweed. she walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic
of her but with care and very slowly becauseâ€”because gerty macdowell
