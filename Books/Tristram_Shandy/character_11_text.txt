e toby received the year after the demolition of
dunkirk, in his affair with widow wadman, had fixed him in a resolution
never more to think of the sex--or of aught which belonged to it;--yet
corporal trim had made no such bargain with himself. indeed in my
uncle toby's case there was a strange and unaccountable concurrence of
circumstances, which insensibly drew him in, to lay siege to that fair
and strong citadel.--in trim's case there was a concurrence of nothing
in the world, but of him and bridget in the kitchen;--though in truth,
the love and veneration he bore his master was such, and so fond was he
of imitating him in all he did, that had my uncle toby employed his
time and genius in tagging of points--i am persuaded the honest corporal
would have laid down his arms, and followed his example with pleasure.
when therefore my uncle toby sat down before the mistress--corporal trim
incontinently took ground before the maid.

now, my dear friend garrick, whom i have so much cause to esteem

it necessary to draw off his forces and raise the siege somewhat
indignantly.

corporal trim, as i said, had made no such bargain either with
himself--or with any one else--the fidelity however of his heart not
suffering him to go into a house which his master had forsaken with
disgust--he contented himself with turning his part of the siege into a
blockade;--that is, he kept others off;--for though he never after went
to the house, yet he never met bridget in the village, but he
would either nod or wink, or smile, or look kindly at her--or (as
circumstances directed) he would shake her by the hand--or ask her
lovingly how she did--or would give her a ribbon--and now-and-then,
though never but when it could be done with decorum, would give bridget
a...--

precisely in this situation, did these things stand for five years; that
is from the demolition of dunkirk in the year 13, to the latter end of
my uncle toby's campaign in the year 18, which was

after he had put my uncle toby to bed, going down one moon-shiny night
to see that every thing was right at his fortifications--in the lane
separated from the bowling-green with flowering shrubs and holly--he
espied his bridget.

as the corporal thought there was nothing in the world so well worth
shewing as the glorious works which he and my uncle toby had made, trim
courteously and gallantly took her by the hand, and led her in: this was
not done so privately, but that the foul-mouth'd trumpet of fame carried
it from ear to ear, till at length it reach'd my father's, with this
untoward circumstance along with it, that my uncle toby's curious

twenty times, word for word as trim told it me.--prithee, how was it
then, corporal? my father would cry, turning to trim.--it was a mere
misfortune, an' please your honour;--i was shewing mrs. bridget

of all mortal, and immortal men too, if you please, who ever
soliloquized upon this mystic subject, my uncle toby was the worst
fitted, to have push'd his researches, thro' such a contention of
feelings; and he had infallibly let them all run on, as we do
worse matters, to see what they would turn out--had not bridget's
pre-notification of them to susannah, and susannah's repeated
manifestoes thereupon to all the world, made it necessary for my uncle
toby to look into the affair.

as mrs. wadman was put to bed, and had got her legs stretched down to
the bottom of it, of which she always gave bridget notice--bridget, with
all suitable decorum, having first open'd the bed-clothes at the feet,
took hold of the half-ell of cloth we are speaking of, and having
gently, and with both her hands, drawn it downwards to its furthest
extension, and then contracted it again side-long by four or five even

wish'd her mistress a good night.

this was constant, and without any other variation than this; that on
shivering and tempestuous nights, when bridget untuck'd the feet of the
bed, &c. to do this--she consulted no thermometer but that of her
own passions; and so performed it standing--kneeling--or squatting,
according to the different degrees of faith, hope, and charity, she was
in, and bore towards her mistress that night. in every other respect,
the etiquette was sacred, and might have vied with the most mechanical
one of the most inflexible bed-chamber in christendom.

resting-place for her elbow, she reclin'd her cheek upon the palm of her
hand, and leaning forwards, ruminated till midnight upon both sides of
the question.

the second night she went to her bureau, and having ordered bridget to
bring her up a couple of fresh candles and leave them upon the table,
she took out her marriage-settlement, and read it over with great
devotion: and the third night (which was the last of my uncle toby's

arbour in mrs. wadman's garden, but planted in the hedge-row of my
uncle toby's, put all the occasions into her hands which love-militancy
wanted; she could observe my uncle toby's motions, and was mistress
likewise of his councils of war; and as his unsuspecting heart had given
leave to the corporal, through the mediation of bridget, to make her
a wicker-gate of communication to enlarge her walks, it enabled her
to carry on her approaches to the very door of the sentry-box; and
sometimes out of gratitude, to make an attack, and endeavour to blow my
uncle toby up in the very sentry-box itself.

chapter 4.xl.

--and so to make sure of both systems, mrs. wadman predetermined to
light my uncle toby neither at this end or that; but, like a prodigal's
candle, to light him, if possible, at both ends at once.

now, through all the lumber rooms of military furniture, including both
of horse and foot, from the great arsenal of venice to the tower of
london (exclusive), if mrs. wadman had been rummaging for seven years
together, and with bridget to help her, she could not have found any one
blind or mantelet so fit for her purpose, as that which the expediency
of my uncle toby's affairs had fix'd up ready to her hands.

i believe i have not told you--but i don't know--possibly i have--be it
as it will, 'tis one of the number of those many things, which a man

mrs. wadman had told it, with all its circumstances, to mrs. bridget

with her, touching some slight misgivings with regard to the issue of
the affairs, which the devil, who never lies dead in a ditch, had put
into her head--before he would allow half time, to get quietly through

the measures were taken at once--and my uncle toby and the corporal went
on with theirs.

a flourish with his right, as just promised success--and no more--if
your honour will give me leave to lay down the plan of this attack--

head--that the day is our own.

uncle toby, contrary to his invariable way of treating his faithful
servant, said nothing good or bad: the truth was, he had not altogether
marshal'd his ideas; he wish'd for another conference, and as the
corporal was mounting up the three steps before the door--he hem'd
twice--a portion of my uncle toby's most modest spirits fled, at each
expulsion, towards the corporal; he stood with the rapper of the door
suspended for a full minute in his hand, he scarce knew why. bridget
stood perdue within, with her finger and her thumb upon the latch,
benumb'd with expectation; and mrs. wadman, with an eye ready to be
deflowered again, sat breathless behind the window-curtain of her
bed-chamber, watching their approach.

trim! said my uncle toby--but as he articulated the word, the minute
expired, and trim let fall the rapper.

my uncle toby perceiving that all hopes of a conference were knock'd on
the head by it--whistled lillabullero.

the donation was not defeated by my uncle toby's wound.

now this last article was somewhat apocryphal; and the devil, who is the
great disturber of our faiths in this world, had raised scruples in mrs.
wadman's brain about it; and like a true devil as he was, had done his
own work at the same time, by turning my uncle toby's virtue thereupon
into nothing but empty bottles, tripes, trunk-hose, and pantofles.



chapter 4.lxxxii.

mrs. bridget had pawn'd all the little stock of honour a poor
chamber-maid was worth in the world, that she would get to the bottom
of the affair in ten days; and it was built upon one of the most
concessible postulata in nature: namely, that whilst my uncle toby was
making love to her mistress, the corporal could find nothing better to
do, than make love to her--'and i'll let him as much as he will, said
bridget, to get it out of him.'

friendship has two garments; an outer and an under one. bridget was

rving her mistress's interests in the one--and doing the thing which
most pleased herself in the other: so had as many stakes depending
upon my uncle toby's wound, as the devil himself--mrs. wadman had but
one--and as it possibly might be her last (without discouraging mrs.
bridget, or discrediting her talents) was determined to play her cards
herself.

she wanted not encouragement: a child might have look'd into his
hand--there was such a plainness and simplicity in his playing out what
trumps he had--with such an unmistrusting ignorance of the ten-ace--and
so naked and defenceless did he sit upon the same sopha with widow
wadman, that a generous heart would have wept to have won the game of
him.

let us drop the metaphor.

the teeth of king garangantan's shepherds--and i'll let them do it,
as bridget said, as much as they please; for how was it possible they
should foresee the necessity i was under of writing the 84th chapter of
my book, before the 77th, &c?

--so i don't take it amiss--all i wish is, that it may be a lesson to
the world, 'to let people tell their stories their own way.'

--and here is the maes--and this is the sambre; said the corporal,
pointing with his right hand extended a little towards the map, and his
left upon mrs. bridget's shoulder--but not the shoulder next him--and
this, said he, is the town of namur--and this the citadel--and there
lay the french--and here lay his honour and myself--and in this cursed
trench, mrs. bridget, quoth the corporal, taking her by the hand, did he
receive the wound which crush'd him so miserably here.--in pronouncing
which, he slightly press'd the back of her hand towards the part he felt
for--and let it fall.

--and left my poor mistress undone too, said bridget.

the corporal made no reply to the repartee, but by giving mrs. bridget a
kiss.

come--come--said bridget--holding the palm of her left hand parallel to
the plane of the horizon, and sliding the fingers of the other over it,
in a way which could not have been done, had there been the least wart
or protruberance--'tis every syllable of it false, cried the corporal,
before she had half finished the sentence--

--i know it to be fact, said bridget, from credible witnesses.

--upon my honour, said the corporal, laying his hand upon his heart,
and blushing, as he spoke, with honest resentment--'tis a st

either i or my mistress care a halfpenny about it, whether 'tis so or

by one at least--

it was somewhat unfortunate for mrs. bridget, that she had begun the
attack with her manual exercise; for the corporal instantly....



chapter 4.lxxxviii.

it was like the momentary contest in the moist eye-lids of an april
morning, 'whether bridget should laugh or cry.'

she snatch'd up a rolling-pin--'twas ten to one, she had laugh'd--

she laid it down--she cried; and had one single tear of 'em but tasted
of bitterness, full sorrowful would the corporal's heart have been that
he had used the argument; but the corporal understood the sex, a quart
major to a terce at least, better than my uncle toby, and accordingly he
assailed mrs. bridget after this manner.

i know, mrs. bridget, said the corporal, giving her a most respectful
kiss, tha

hast been set on, and deluded, dear bridget, as is often a woman's case,
'to please others more than themselves--'

bridget's eyes poured down at the sensations the corporal excited.

--tell me--tell me, then, my dear bridget, continued the corporal,
taking hold of her hand, which hung down dead by her side,--and giving a
second kiss--whose suspicion has misled thee?

bridget sobb'd a sob or two--then open'd her eyes--the corporal wiped
'em with the bottom of her apron--she then open'd her heart and told him
all.



chapter 4.lxxxix.

my uncle toby and the corporal had gone on separately with their
operations the greatest part of the campaign, and as effectually cut
off from all communication of what either the one

or the other had been
doing, as if they had been separated from each other by the maes or the
sambre.

my uncle toby, on his side, had presented himself every afternoon in his
red and silver, and blue and gold alternately, and sustained an infinity
of attacks in them, without knowing them to be attacks--and so had
nothing to communicate--

the corporal, on his side, in taking bridget, by it had gain'd
considerable advantages--and consequently had much to communicate--but
what were the advantages--as well as what was the manner by which he had
seiz'd them, required so nice an historian, that the corporal durst not
venture upon it; and as sensible as he was of glory, would rather have
been contented to have gone bareheaded and without laurels for ever,
than torture his master's modesty for a single moment--

the corporal made no reply to my uncle toby's protestation, but by a
short cough--he dipp'd the pen a second time into the inkhorn; and my
uncle toby, pointing with the end of his pipe as close to the top of the
sheet at the left hand corner of it, as he could get it--the corporal
wrote down the word humanity...thus.

prithee, corporal, said my uncle toby, as soon as trim had done it--how
often does mrs. bridget enquire after the wound on the cap of thy knee,
which thou received'st at the battle of landen?

she never, an' please your honour, enquires after it at all.

that, corporal, said my uncle toby, with all the triumph the goodness of
his nature would permit--that shews the difference in the character
of the mistress and maid--had the fortune of war allotted the same
mischance to me, mrs. wadman would have enquired into every circumstance
relating to it a hundred times--she would have enquired, an

compassion to do with a wound upon the cap of a man's knee? had your
honour's been shot into ten thousand splinters at the affair of landen,
mrs. wadman would have troubled her head as little about it as bridget;
because, added the corporal, lowering his voice, and speaking very
distinctly, as he assigned his reason--

'the knee is such a distance from the main body--whereas the groin, your
honour knows, is upon the very curtain of the place.'

my uncle toby gave a long whistle--but in a note which could scarce be
heard across the table.

the corporal had advanced too far to retire--in three words he told the
rest--

my uncle toby laid down his pipe as gently upon the fender, as if it had

there will be just time, whilst my uncle toby and trim are walking to
my father's, to inform you that mrs. wadman had, some moons before this,
made a confident of my mother; and that mrs. bridget, who had the burden
of her own, as well as her mistress's secret to carry, had got happily
delivered of both to susannah behind the garden-wall.

as for my mother, she saw nothing at all in it, to make the least bustle
about--but susannah was sufficient by herself for all the ends and
purposes you could possibly have, in exporting a family secret; for she
instantly imparted it by signs to jonathan--and jonathan by tokens to
the cook as she was basting a loin of mutton; the cook sold it with som
