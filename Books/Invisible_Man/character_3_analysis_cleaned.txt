ras the exhorter
one of the most memorable characters in the novel, ras
the exhorter (later called ras the destroyer) is a powerful figure
who seems to embody ellison's fears for the future of the civil
rights battle in america. ras's name, which literally means "prince"
in one of the languages of ethiopia, sounds simultaneously like
"race" and "ra," the egyptian sun god. these allusions capture the
essence of the character: as a passionate black nationalist, ras
is obsessed with the idea of race; as a magnificently charismatic
leader, he has a kind of godlike power in the novel, even if he
doesn't show a deity's wisdom. ras's guiding philosophy, radical
at the time the novel was published, states that blacks should cast
off oppression and prejudice by destroying the ability of white
men to control them. this philosophy leads inevitably to violence,
and, as a result, both ellison and the narrator fear and oppose
such notions. yet, although ellison objects to the ideology that
ras embodies, he never portrays him as a clear-cut villain. throughout
the novel, the reader witnesses ras exert a magnetic pull on crowds
of black americans in harlem. he offers hope and courage to many.
by the late 1960s, many black leaders, including
malcolm x, were advocating ideas very similar to those of ras.
ras, who is depicted as a west indian, has reminded many
critics of marcus garvey, a jamaican-born black nationalist who
was influential in the early 1920s. like
ras, garvey was a charismatic racial separatist with a love of flamboyant
costumes who advocated black pride and argued against integration
with whites. (garvey even endorsed the ku klux klan for working
to keep whites and blacks separate.) however, ellison consistently
denied patterning ras specifically on garvey. if any link does exist,
it is probably only that garvey inspired the idea of ras, not that
ellison attempted to recreate garvey in ras.
