jrr tolkien -- the hobbit 
 
in this reprint several minor inaccuracies, most of them noted by readers, have been 
corrected. for example, the text on pages 32 and 62 now corresponds exactly with the 
runes on thror's map. more important is the matter of "chapter five". there the true 
story of the ending of the riddle game, as it was eventually revealed (under pressure) 
by bilbo to gandalf, is now given according to the red book, in place of the version 
bilbo first gave to his friends, and actually set down in his diary. this departure from 
truth on the part of a most honest hobbit was a portent of great significance. it does not, 
however, concern the present story, and those who in this edition make their first 
acquaintance with hobbit-lore need not troupe about it. its explanation lies in the history 
of the ring, as it was set out in the chronicles of **the red book of wes

ears old or so, and living in 
the beautiful hobbit-hole built by his father, which i have just described for you, until he 
had in fact apparently settled down immovably. 
by some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was 
less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous, and 
bilbo baggins was standing at his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long 
wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes (neatly brushed) - gandalf 
came by. gandalf! if you had heard only a quarter of what i have heard about him, and i 
have only heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort i of 
remarkable tale. 
tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went, in the most 
extraordinary fashion. he had not been down that way under the hill for ages and ages, 
not since his friend the old took died, in fact, and the hobbits had almost forgotten what 
he looked like. he had been away o

his own since they were all small hobbit-boys and hobbit-girls. 
all that the unsuspecting bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. he had a 
tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which a white beard hung 
down below his waist, and immense black boots. 
"good morning!" said bilbo, and he meant it. the sun was shining, and the grass was 
very green. but gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out 

further than the brim of his shady hat. "what do you mean?" be said. "do you wish me a 
good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether i want not; or that you feel 
good this morning; or that it is morning to be good on?" 
"all of them at once," said bilbo. "and a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of 
doors, into the bargain. if you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a fill of mine! 
there's no hurry, we hav

e all the day before us!" 
then bilbo sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a beautiful 
grey ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over the 
hill. 
"very pretty!" said gandalf. "but i have no time to blow smoke-rings this morning. i am 
looking for someone to share in an adventure that i am arranging, and it's very difficult to 
find anyone." 
«i should think so - in these parts! we are plain quiet folk and have no use for 
adventures. nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! make you late for dinner! i can't think 
what anybody sees in them,» said our mr. baggins, and stuck one thumb behind his 
braces, and blew out another even bigger smokering. 
then he took out h

old man. he had decided that he was not quite his sort, and wanted him to 
go away. but the old man did not move. he stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the 
hobbit without saying anything, till bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross. 
"good morning!" he said at last. "we don't want any adventures here, thank you! you 
might try over the hill or across the water." by this he meant that the conversation was 
at an end. 
"what a lot of things you do use good morning for!" said gandalf. "now you mean that 
you want to get rid of me, and that it won't be good till i move off." 
"not at all, not at all, my dear sir! let me see, i don't think i know your name?" 
"yes, yes, my dear sir - and i do know your name, mr. bilbo baggins. and you do know 
my name, though you don't remember that i belong to it. i am gandalf, and gandalf 
means me! to think that i should have lived to be goodmorninged by belladonna took's 
son, as if i was selling buttons at the door!" 
"gandalf, gandalf!

sons? not the man that used to make such particularly excellent fireworks! i remember 
those! old took used to have them on midsummer's eve. splendid! they used to go up 
like great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all 
evening!" you will notice already that mr. baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to 
believe, also that he was very fond of flowers. "dear me!" she went on. "not the gandalf 
who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the blue for mad 
adventures. anything from climbing trees to visiting elves - or sailing in ships, sailing to 
other shores! bless me, life used to be quite inter - i mean, you used to upset things 
badly in these parts once upon a time. i beg your pardon, but i had no idea you were still

"where else should i be?" said the wizard. "all the same i am pleased to find you

, thank you. not today. good morning! 
but please come to tea - any time you like! why not tomorrow? come tomorrow! 
good-bye!" 
with that the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his round green door, and shut it as 
quickly as he dared, not to seen rude. wizards after all are wizards. 
"what on earth did i ask him to tea for!" he said to him-self, as he went to the pantry. he 
had only just had break fast, but he thought a cake or two and a drink of something 
would do him good after his fright. gandalf in the meantime was still standing outside the 
door, and laughing long but quietly. 
after a while he stepped up, and with the spike of his staff scratched a queer sign on the 
hobbit's beautiful green front-door. then he strode away, just about the time when bilbo 
was finishing his second cake and beginning to think that he had escape adventures 
very well. 
the next day he had almost forgotten about gandalf. he did not remember things very 
well, unless he put them down on his engagement ta

blet: like this: gandalf '¥a 
wednesday. yesterday he had been too flustered to do anything of the kind. just before 
tea-time there came a tremendous ring on the front-door bell, and then he remembered! 
he rushed and put on the kettle, and put out another cup and saucer and an extra cake 
or two, and ran to the door. 
"i am so sorry to keep you waiting!" he was going to say, when he saw that it was not 
gandalf at all. it was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt, and very bright 
eyes under his dark-green hood. as soon a the door was opened, he pushed inside, just 
as if he had been expected. 
he hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg, and "dwalin at your service!" he said with 
a low bow. 
"bilbo baggins at yours!" said the hobbit, too surprised to ask any questions for the 
moment. when the silence that followed had become uncomfortable, he added: "i am 
just about to take tea; pray

 come and have some with me." a little stiff perhaps, but he 
meant it kindly. and what would you do, if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his things 
up in your hall without a word of explanation? 
they had not been at table long, in fact they had hardly reached the third cake, when 
there came another even louder ring at the bell. 
"excuse me!" said the hobbit, and off he went to the door. 
"so you have got here at last!" was what he was going to say to gandalf this time. but it 
was not gandalf. instead there was a very old-looking dwarf on the step with a white 
beard and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped inside as soon as the door was open, just 
as if he had been invited. 
"i see they have begun to arrive already," he said when he caught sight of dwalin's 
green hood hanging up. he hung his red one next to it, and "balin at your service!" he 
said with his hand on his breast. 
"thank you!" said bilbo with a gasp. it was not the correct thing to say, but they have 
begun to arrive h

lbo found himself answering, to his own surprise; and he found himself scuttling 
off, too, to the cellar to fill a pint beer-mug, and to the pantry to fetch two beautiful round 
seed-cakes which he had baked that afternoon for his after-supper morsel. 
when he got back balin and dwalin were talking at the table like old friends (as a matter 
of fact they were brothers). bilbo plumped down the beer and the cake in front of them, 
when loud came a ring at the bell again, and then another ring. 
"gandalf for certain this time," he thought as he puffed along the passage. but it was 
not. it was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow beards; and 
each of them carried a bag of tools and a spade. 
in they hopped, as soon as the door began to open-bilbo was hardly surprised at all. 
"what can i do for you, my dwarves?" he said. "kili at your service!" said the one. "and 
fili!" added the other; and they both swept off their blue hoods and bowed. 
"at yours and your family's

hearth, the seed-cakes were gone, and the 
dwarves were starting on a round of buttered scones, when there came-a loud knock. 
not a ring, but a hard rat-tat on the hobbit's beautiful green door. somebody was 
banging with a stick! 
bilbo rushed along the passage, very angry, and altogether bewildered and bewuthered-
this was the most awkward wednesday he ever remembered. he pulled open the door 
with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other. more dwarves, four more! and 
there was gandalf behind, leaning on his staff and laughing. he had made quite a dent 
on the beautiful door; he had also, by the way, knocked out the secret mark that he had 
put there the morning before. 
"carefully! carefully!" he said. "it is not like you, bilbo, to keep friends waiting on the 
mat, and then open the door like a pop-gun! let me introduce bifur, bofur, bombur, and 
especially thorin!" 
"at your service!" said bifur, bofur, and bombur standing in a row. then they hung up 
two yellow hoods and

this last belonged to thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in fact no other than 
the great thorin oakenshield himself, who was not at all pleased at falling flat on bilbo's 

mat with bifur, bofur, and bombur on top of him. for one thing bombur was immensely 
fat and heavy. 
thorin indeed was very haughty, and said nothing about service; but poor mr. baggins 
said he was sorry so many times, that at last he grunted "pray don't mention it," and 
stopped frowning. 
"now we are all here!" said gandalf, looking at the row of thirteen hoods-the best 
detachable party hoods-and his own hat hanging on the pegs. 
"quite a merry gathering! 
i hope there is something left for the late-comers to eat and drink! 
what's that? tea! no thank you! a little red wine, i think, for me." "and for me," said 
thorin. "and raspberry jam and apple-tart," said bifur. "and mincepies and cheese," said 
bofur. "and pork-pie and salad," said bombur. "and more cakes-and ale-and coffee, if 
you don't mind," called the

other dwarves through the door. 
"put on a few eggs, there's a good fellow!" gandalf called after him, as the hobbit 
stumped off to the pantries. "and just bring out the cold chicken and pickles!" 
"seems to know as much about the inside of my larders as i do myself!" thought mr. 
baggins, who was feeling positively flummoxed, and was beginning to wonder whether a 
most wretched adventure had not come right into his house. 
by the time he had got all the bottles and dishes and knives and forks and glasses and 
plates and spoons and things piled up on big trays, he was getting

very hot, and red in 
the face, and annoyed. 
"confusticate and bebother these dwarves!" he said aloud. "why don't they come and 
lend a hand?" lo and behold! there stood balin and dwalin at the door of the kitchen, 
and fili and kili behind them, and before he could say knife they had whisked the trays 
and a couple of small tables into the parlour and set out everything afresh. 
gandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen, dwarves all round: and bilbo sat on 
a stool at the fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (his appetite was quite taken away), and trying 
to look as if this was all perfectly ordinary and. not in the least an adventure. the 
dwarves ate and ate, and talked and talked, and time got on. at last they pushed their 
chairs back, and bilbo made a move to collect the plates and glasses. 
"i suppose you will all stay to supper?" he said in his politest unpress

ing tones. "of 
course!" said thorin. "and after. we shan't get through the business till late, and we 
must have some music first. now to clear up!" 
thereupon the twelve dwarves-not thorin, he was too important, and stayed talking to 
gandalf-jumped to their feet and made tall piles of all the things. 
off they went, not waiting for trays, balancing columns of plates, each with a bottle on 
the top, with one hand, while the hobbit ran after them almost squeaking with fright: 
"please be careful!" and "please, don't trouble! i can manage." but the dwarves only 
started to sing: 
 
"chip the glasses and crack the plates! 
blunt the knives and bend the forks! 
that's what bilbo baggins hates- 
smash the bottles and burn the corks!

was cleaned and 
put away safe as quick as lightning, while the hobbit was turning round and round in the 
middle of the kitchen trying to see what they were doing. then they went back, and 
found thorin with his feet on the fender smoking a pipe. he was blowing the most 
enormous smoke-rings, and wherever he told one to go, it went-up the chimney, or 
behind the clock on the mantelpiece, or under the table, or round and round the ceiling; 
but wherever it went it was not quick enough to escape gandalf. pop! he sent a smaller 
smokering from his short clay-pipe straight through each one of thorin's. the gandalf's 
smoke-ring would go green and come back to hover over the wizard's head. he had 
quite a cloud of them about him already, and in the dim light it made him look strange 
and sorcerous. bilbo stood still and watched-he loved smoke-rings-and then be blushed 
to think how proud he had been yesterday morning of the smoke-rings he had sent up 
the wind over the hill. 
"now for some music!

lves, 
and with thorin's harp wrapped in a green cloth. it was a beautiful gold-en harp, and 
when thorin struck it the music began all at once, so sudden and sweet that 
bilbo forgot everything else, and was swept away into dark lands under strange moons, 
far over the water and very far from his hobbit-hole under the hill. 
the dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of the hill; 
the firelight flickered-it was april-and still they played on, while the shadow of gandalf's 
beard wagged against the wall. 
the dark filled all the room, and the fire died down, and the shadows were lost, and still 
they played on. and suddenly first one and then another began to sing as they played, 
deep-throated singing of the dwarves in the deep places of their ancient homes; and this 
is like a fragment of their song, if it can be like their song without their music. 
 
"far over the misty mountains cold

, and they were all looking 
at him with eyes shining in the dark. 
"where are you going?" said thorin, in a tone that seemed to show that he 
guessed both halves of the hobbit's mind. 
"what about a little light?" said bilbo apologetically. 
"we like the dark," said the dwarves. "dark for dark business! there are many hours 
before dawn." 
"of course!" said bilbo, and sat down in a hurry. he missed the stool and sat in the 
fender, knocking over the poker and shovel with a crash. 
"hush!" said gandalf. "let thorin speak!" and this is bow thorin began. 
"gandalf, dwarves and mr. baggins! we are not together in the house of our friend and 
fellow conspirator, this most excellent and audacious hobbitmay the hair on his toes 

never fall out! all praise to his wine and ale!-" he paused for breath and for a polite 
remark from the hob-bit, but the compliments were quite lost on-poor bilbo baggins, who 
was wagging his mouth in protest at being called audacious and worst of all fellow 
conspirato

r, though no noise came out, he was so flummoxed. so thorin went on: 
"we are met to discuss our plans, our ways, means, policy and devices. we shall soon 
before the break of day start on our long journey, a journey from which some of us, or 
perhaps all of us (except our friend and counsellor, the ingenious wizard gandalf) may 
never return. it is a solemn moment. our object is, i take it, well known to us all. to the 
estimable mr. baggins, and perhaps to one or two of the younger dwarves (i think i 
should be right in naming kili and fili, for instance), the exact situation at the moment 
may require a little brief explanation-" 
this was thorin's style. he was an important dwarf. if he had been allowed, he would 
probably have gone on like this until he was out of breath, without telling any one there

bear it any longer. at may never return he began to feel a shriek coming up inside, and 
very soon it burst out like the whistle of an engine coming out of a tunnel. all the 
dwarves sprang bp knocking over the table. gandalf struck a blue light on the end of his 
magic staff, and in its firework glare the poor little hobbit could be seen kneeling on the 
hearth-rug, shaking like a jelly that was melting. then he fell flat on the floor, and kept on 
calling out "struck by lightning, struck by lightning!" over and over again; and that was all 
they could get out of him for a long time. so they took him and laid him out of the way on 
the drawingroom sofa with a drink at his elbow, and they went back to their dark

siness. 
"excitable little fellow," said gandalf, as they sat down again. "gets funny queer fits, but 
he is one of the best, one of the best-as fierce as a dragon in a pinch." 
if you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch, you will realise that this was only poetical 
exaggeration applied to any hobbit, even to old took's greatgranduncle 
bullroarer, who was so huge (for a hobbit) that he could ride a horse. he charged the 
ranks of the goblins of mount gram in the battle of the green fields, and knocked their 
king gol-firnbul's head clean off

 with a wooden club. it sailed a hundred yards through 
the air and went down a rabbit hole, and in this way the battle was won and the game of 
golf invented at the same moment. 
in the meanwhile, however, bullroarer's gentler descendant was reviving in the drawing-
room. after a while and a drink he crept nervously to the door of the parlour. this is what 
he heard, gloin speaking: "humph!" (or some snort more or less like that). "will he do, 
do you think? it is all very well for gandalf to talk about this hobbit being fierce, but one 
shriek like that in a moment of excitement would be enough to wake the dragon and all 
his relatives, and kill the lot of us. i think it sounded more like fright than excitement! 
in fact, if it bad not been for the sign on the door, i should have been sure we had come 
to the wrong house. as soon as i clapped eyes on the little fellow bobbing and puffing on 
the mat, i had my doubts. he looks more like a grocerthan a burglar!"

and i assure you there is a mark on this door-the usual one in the trade, or used to be. 
burglar wants a good job, plenty of excitement and reasonable reward, that's how it is 
usually read. you ^an say expert treasure-hunter instead of burglar if you like. some of 
them do. it's all the same to us. 
gandalf told us that there was a man of the sort in these parts looking for a job at once, 
and that he had arranged for a meeting here this wednesday teatime." 
"of course there is a mark," said gandalf. "i put it there myself. for very good reasons. 
you asked me to find the fourteenth man for your expedition, and i chose mr. baggins. 
just let any one say i chose the wrong man or the wrong house, and you can stop at 
thirteen and have all the bad luck you like, or go back to digging coal."

ed so angrily at gloin that the dwarf huddled back in his chair; and when bilbo 
tried to open his mouth to ask a question, he turned and frowned at him and stuck oat 
his bushy eyebrows, till bilbo shut his mouth tight with a snap. "that's right," said 
gandalf. "let's have no more argument. 
i have chosen mr. baggins and that ought to !6te enough for all of you. if i say he is a 
burglar, a burglar he is, or will be when the time comes. there is a lot more in him than 
you guess, and a deal more than he has any idea of himself. you may (possibly) all live 
to thank me yet. now bilbo, my boy, fetch the lamp, and let's have little light on this!" 
on the table in the light of a big lamp with a red shad he spread a piece 
of parchment rather like a map.

eems a great big hole to me," squeaked bilbo (who had no experience of dragons 
and only of hobbit-holes) he was getting excited and interested again, so that he forgot 
to keep his mouth shut. he loved maps, and in his hall there hung a large one of the 
country round with all his favourite walks marked on it in red ink. "how could such a 
large door be kept secret from everybody outside, apart from the dragon?" he asked. he 
was only a little hobbit you must remember. 
"in lots of ways," said gandalf. "but in what way this one has been hidden we don't know 
without going to see. from what it says on the map i should guess there is a closed door 

which has been made to look exactly like the side of the mountain. that is the usual 
dwarves' method- i think that is right, isn't it?" "quite right," said thorin. 
"also," went on gandalf, "i forgot to mention that with the map went a key, a small and 
curious key. here it is!" he said, and handed to thorin a key with a long barrel and 
intricat

e wards, made of silver. "keep it safe!" 
"indeed i will," said thorin, and he fastened it upon a fine chain that hung about his neck 
and under his jacket. "now things begin to look more hopeful. this news alters them 
much for-the better. so far we have had no clear idea what to do. we thought of going 
east, as quiet and careful as we could, as far as the long lake. after that the trouble 
would begin." 
"a long time before that, if i know anything about the loads east," interrupted gandalf. 
"we might go from there up along the river running," went on thorin taking no notice, 
"and so to the ruins of dale-the old town in the valley there, under the shadow of the 
mountain. but we none of us liked the idea of the front gate. the river runs right out of it 
through the great cliff at the south of the mountain, and out of it comes the dragon too-
far too often, unless he has changed." 
"that would be no good," said the wizard, "not without a mighty warrior, even a hero. i

the gold and the dragon, and all that, and how it got there, and who it belongs to, and so 
on and further." 
"bless me!" said thorin, "haven't you got a map? and didn't you hear our song? and 
haven't we been talking about all this for hours?" 
"all the same, i should like it all plain and clear," said he obstinately, putting on his 
business manner (usually reserved for people who tried to borrow money off him), and 
doing his best to appear wise and prudent and professional and live up to gandalf's 
recommendation. "also i should like to know about risks, out-of-pocket expenses, time 
required and remuneration, and so forth"-by which he meant: "what am i going to get 
out of it? and am i going to come back alive?" 
"o very well," said thorin. "long ago in my grandfather thror's time our family was 
driven out of the far north, and came back with all their wealth and their tools to this 
mountain on the map. it had been discovered by my far ancestor, thrain the old, but

we have never forgotten our stolen treasure. and even now, when i will allow we have a 
good bit laid by and are not so badly off"-here thorin stroked the gold chain round his 
neck-"we still mean to get it back, and to bring our curses home to smaugif we can. 
"i have often wondered about my father's and my grandfather's escape. i see now they 
must have had a private side-door which only they knew about. but apparently they 
made a map, and i should like to know how gandalf got hold of it, and why it did not 
come down to me, the rightful heir." 
"i did not 'get hold of it,' i was given it," said the wizard. 
"your grandfather thror was killed, you remember, in the mines of moria by azog the 
goblin -" 
"curse his name, yes," said thorin. 
"and thrain your father went away on the twenty-first of april, a hundred years ago last 
thursday, and has never been seen by you since-" 

"true, true," said thorin. 
"well, your father gave me this to give to you; and if i h

after your grandfather was killed; and lots of adventures of a most unpleasant sort he 
had, but he never got near the mountain. how he got there i don't know, but i found him 
a prisoner in the dungeons of the necromancer." 
"whatever were you doing there?" asked thorin with a shudder, and all the dwarves 
shivered. 
"never you mind. i was finding things out, as usual; and a nasty dangerous business it 
was. even i, gandalf, only just escaped. i tried to save your father, but it was too late. 
he was witless and wandering, and had forgotten almost everything except the map and 
the key." "we have long ago paid the goblins of moria," said thorin; "we must give a 
thought to the necromancer." "don't be absurd! he is an enemy quite beyond the 
powers of all the dwarves put together, if they could all be collected again from the four 
corners of the world. the one thing your father wished was for his son to read the m

washed up. then he had a nice little breakfast in the kitchen before turning out the 
dining-room. by that time the sun was shining; and the front door was open, letting in a 
warm spring breeze. bilbo began to whistle loudly and to forget about the night before. in 
fact he was just sitting down to a nice little second breakfast in the dining-room by the 
open window, when in walked gandalf. "my dear fellow," said he, "whenever are you 
going to come? what about an early start?-and here you are having breakfast, or 
whatever you call it, at half past ten! they left you the message, because they could not 
wait." 
"what message?" said poor mr. baggins all in a fluster. 
"great elephants!" said gandalf, "you are not at all yourself this morning-you have never 
dusted the mantel- piece!" 
"what's that got to do with it? i have had enough to do with washing up for fourteen!" 
"if you

"that leaves you just ten minutes. you will have to run," said gandalf.

"no time for it," said the wizard. 
"but-"said bilbo again. 
"no time for that either! off you go!" 
to the end of his days bilbo could never remember how he found himself outside, 
without a hat, walking-stick or say money, or anything that he usually took when he went 

out; leaving his second breakfast half-finished and quite unwashed-up, pushing his keys 
into gandalf's hands, and running as fast as his furry feet could carry him down the lane, 
past the great mill, a

that's how they all came to start, jogging off from the inn one fine morning just before 
may, on laden ponies; and bilbo was wearing a dark-green hood (a little weather-
stained) and a dark-green cloak borrowed from dwalin. 
they were too large for him, and he looked rather comic. what his father bungo would 
have thought of him, i daren't think. his only comfort was he couldn't be mistaken for a 
dwarf, as he had no beard. 
they had not been riding very long when up came gandalf very splendid on a white 
horse. he had brought a lot of pocket-handkerchiefs, and bilbo's pipe and tobacco. so 
after that the party went along very merrily, and they told stories or sang songs as they 
rode forward all day, except of course when they stopped for meals. these didn't come 
quite as often as bilbo would have liked them, but still he began to feel that adventures 
were not so bad after all. at first they had passed through hobbit-lands, a wild 
respectable country inhabited by de

p, and the willows along the river-bank bent and sighed. i don't know 
what river it was, a rushing red one, swollen with the rains of the last few days, that 
came down from the hills and mountains in front of them. soon it was nearly dark. the 
winds broke up the grey clouds, and a waning moon appeared above the hills between 

the flying rags. then they stopped, and thorin muttered something about supper, "and 
where shall we get a dry patch to sleep on?" not until then did they notice that gandalf 
was missing. so far he had come all the way with them, never saying if he was in the 
adventure or merely keeping them company for a while. he had eaten most, talked 
most, and laughed most. but now he simply was not there at all! 
"just when a wizard would have been most useful, too," groaned dori and nori (who 
shared the hobbit's views about regular meals, plenty and often). 
they decided in the end that they would have to camp where they were. so far they had 
not camped before on this jou

ter than little supper, less breakfast, and wet clothes all 
the night. others said: "these parts are none too well known, and are too near the 
mountains. travellers seldom come this way now. the old maps are no use: things have 
changed for the worse and the road is unguarded. 
they have seldom even heard of the king round here, and the less inquisitive you are as 
you go along, the less trouble you are likely to find." some said: 
"after all there are fourteen of us." others said: "where has gandalf got to?" this remark 
was repeated by everybody. then the rain began to pour down worse than ever, and oin 
and gloin began to fight. that settled it. "after all we have got a burglar with us," they 
said; and so they made off, leading their ponies (with all due and proper caution) in the 
direction of the light. they came to the hill and were soon in the wood. up the hill they 
went; but there was no proper path to be seen, such as might lead to a house or a farm; 
and do what they could they

 right over thorin's head and down to his toes. and so the fight ended. a 
nice pickle they were all in now: all neatly tied up in sacks, with three angry trolls (and 
two with burns and bashes to remember) sitting by them, arguing whether they should 
roast them slowly, or mince them fine and boil them, or just sit on them one by one and 
squash them into jelly: and bilbo up in a bush, with his clothes and his skin torn, not 
daring to move for fear they should hear him. 
it was just then that gandalf came back. but no one saw him. the trolls had just decided 
to roast the dwarves now and eat them later-that was bert's idea, and after a lot of 
argument they had all agreed to it. 
"no good roasting 'em now, it'd take all night," said a voice. bert thought it was william's. 
"don't start the argument all over-again. bill," he said, "or it will take all night." 
"who's a-arguing?" said william, who thought it was. bert that had spoken. 
"you are," said bert. 
"you're a liar," said william; and

twitter in the branches. william never spoke for he stood turned to stone as he stooped; 
and bert and tom were stuck like rocks as they looked at him. and there they stand to 
this day, all alone, unless the birds perch on them; for trolls, as you probably know, must 
be underground before dawn, or they go back to the stuff of the mountains they are 
made of, and never move again. that is what had happened to bert and tom and 
william. 
"excellent!" said gandalf, as he stepped from behind a tree, and helped bilbo to climb 
down out of a thorn-bush. then bilbo understood. it was the wizard's voice that had kept 
the trolls bickering and quarrelling, until the light came and made an end of them. 
the next thing was to untie the sacks and let out the dwarves. they were nearly 
suffocated, and very annoyed: they had not at all enjoyed lying there listening to the 
trolls making plans for roasting them and squashing them and mincing them. they had

bilbo's account of what had happened to him twice over, before they were 
satisfied. 
"silly time to go practising pinching and pocket-picking," said bombur, "when what we 
wanted was fire and food!" 
"and that's just what you wouldn't have got of those fellows without a struggle, in any 
case," said gandalf. 
"anyhow you are wasting time now. don't you realize that the trolls must have a cave or 
a hole dug somewhere near to hide from the sun in? we must look into it!" 
they searched about, and soon found the marks of trolls' stony boots going away 
through the trees. they followed the tracks up the hill, until hidden by bushes they came 
on a big door of stone leading to a cave. but they could not open it, not though they all 
pushed while gandalf tried various incantations.

ood?" asked bilbo, when they were getting tired and angry. "i found 
it on the ground where the trolls had their fight." he held out a largish key, though no 
doubt william had thought it very small and secret. it must have fallen out of his pocket, 
very luckily, before he was turned to stone. 
"why on earth didn't you mention it before?" they cried. 
gandalf grabbed it and fitted it into the key-hole. then the stone door swung back with 
one big push, and they all went inside. there were bones on the floor and a nasty smell 
was in the air; but there was a good deal of food jumbled carelessly on shelves and on 
the ground, among an untidy litter of plunder, of all sorts from brass buttons to pots full of 
gold coins standing in a corner. there were lots of clothes, too, hanging on the walls-too 
small for trolls, i am afraid they belonged to victim

s-and among them were several 
swords of various makes, shapes, and sizes. two caught their eyes particularly, 
because of their beautiful scabbards and jewelled hilts. gandalf and thorin each took 
one of these; and bilbo took a knife in a leather sheath. 
it would have made only a tiny pocket-knife for a troll, but it was as good as a short 
sword for the hobbit. 

"these look like good blades," said the wizard, half drawing them and looking at them 
curiously. "they were not made by any troll, nor by any smith among men in these parts 
and days; but when we can read the runes on them, we shall know more about them." 
"let's get out of this horrible smell!" said fi

hey slept, for their night had been disturbed; (and they did nothing more till the 
afternoon. then they i brought up their ponies, and carried away the pots of gold, and 
buried them very secretly not far from the track by the river, putting a great many spells 
over them, just in case they ever had the-chance to come back and recover them. when 
that was done, they all mounted once more, and jogged along again on the path towards 
the east. 
"where did you go to, if i may ask?" said thorin to gandalf as they rode along. 
"to look ahead," said he. 
"and what brought you back in the nick of time?" 
"looking behind," said he. 
"exactly!" said thorin; "but could you be more plain?" 
"i went on to spy out our road. it will soon become dangerous and difficult. also i was 
anxious about replenishing our small stock of provisions. i had not gone very far, 
however, when i met a couple of friends of mine from rivendell." 
"where's that?" asked bilbo, 
"don't interrupt!" said gandalf. "you will get t

lonely mountain in the east where smaug lies on our treasure." 
"o!" said bilbo, and just at that moment he felt more fared than he ever remembered 
feeling before. he was thinking once again of his comfortable chair before the fire in his 
favourite sitting-room in his hobbit-hole, and of the kettle singing. not for the last time! 
now gandalf led the way. "we must not miss the road, or we shall be done for," he said. 
"we need food, for one thing, and rest in reasonable safetyalso it is very necessary to 
tackle the misty mountains by the proper path, or else you will get lost in them, and have 
to come back and start at the beginning again (if you ever get back at all)." 
they asked him where he was making for, and he answered: "you are come to the very 
edge of the wild, as some of you may know. hidden somewhere ahead of us is the

it was indeed a much wider land from the ford to the mountains than ever you would 
have guessed. bilbo was astonished. the only path was marked with white stones some 
of which were small, and others were half covered with moss or heather. altogether it 
was a very slow business following the track, even guided by gandalf, who seemed to 
know his way about pretty well. 
his head and beard wagged this way and that as he looked for the stones, and they 
followed his head, but they seemed no nearer to the end of the search when the day 
began to fail. tea-time had long gone by, and it seemed suppertime would soon do the 
same. there were moths fluttering about, and the light became very dim, for the moon 
had not risen. bilbo's pony began to stumble over roots and stones. they came to the 
edge of a steep fall in t

the slope. 
"here it is at last!" he called, and the others gathered round him and looked over the 
edge. they saw a valley far below. they could hear the voice of hurrying water in rocky 
bed at the bottom; the scent of trees was in the air; and there was a light on the valley-
side across the water. bilbo never forgot the way they slithered and slipped in the dusk 
down the steep zig-zag path into the secret valley of rivendell. the air grew warmer as

very foolish thing to think), or get annoyed with them. for some elves tease them and 
laugh at them, and most of all at their beards. 
"well, well!" said a voice. "just look! bilbo the hobbit on a pony, my dear! isn't it 
delicious!" 
"most astonishing wonderful!" 
then off they went into another song as ridiculous as the one i have written down in full. 
at last one, a tall young fellow, came out from the trees and bowed to gandalf and to 
thorin. 
"welcome to the valley!" he said. 

"thank you!" said thorin a bit gruffly; but gandalf was already off his horse and among 
the elves, talking merrily with them. 
"you are a little out of your way," said the elf: "that is, if you are making for the only path 
across the water and to the house beyond. we will set you right, but you had best get on

each leading his pony by the bridle. the elves had brought bright lanterns to the shore, 
and they sang a merry song as the party went across. 
"don't dip your beard in the foam, father!" they cried to thorin, who was bent almost on 
to his hands and knees. "it is long enough without watering it." 
"mind bilbo doesn't eat all the cakes!" they called. "he is too fat to get through key-holes 
yet!" 
"hush, hush! good people! and good night!" said gandalf, who came last. 
"valleys have ears, and some elves have over merry tongues. good night!" 
and so at last they all came to the last homely house, and found its doors flung wide. 
now it is a strange thing, but things that are good to have and days that are good to 
spend are soon told about, and not much to listen to; while things that are 
uncomfortable, palpitating, and even gruesome, may make a good tale, and take a deal 
of telling anyway. they stayed long in that good house, fourteen days

 of every kind. that day he looked at the swords they had 
brought from the trolls' lair, and he said: "these are not troll-make. they are old swords, 
very old swords of the high elves of the west, my kin. they were made in gondolin for 
the goblin-wars. they must have come from a dragon's hoard or goblin plunder, for 
dragons and goblins destroyed that city many ages ago. this, thorin, the runes name 
orcrist, the goblin-cleaver in the ancient tongue of gondolin; it was a famous blade. 
this, gandalf, was glamdring, foe-hammer that the king of gondolin once wore. keep 
them well!" 
"whence did the trolls get them, i wonder?" said thorin looking at his 
sword with new interest. 
"i could not say," said elrond, "but one may guess that your trolls had plundered other 
plunderers, or come on the remnants of old robberies in some hold in the mountains of 
the north. i have heard that there are still forgotten treasures of old to be found in the 
deserted caverns of the mines of moria, since the

on-letters are rune-letters, but you cannot see them," said elrond, "not when you 
look straight at them. they can only be seen when the moon shines behind them, and 
what is more, with the more cunning sort it must be a moon of the same shape and 
season as the day when they were written. the dwarves invented them and wrote them 
with silver pens, as your friends could tell you. these must have been written on a 
midsummer's eve in a crescent moon, a long while ago." 
"what do they say?" asked gandalf and thorin together, a bit vexed perhaps that even 
elrond should have found this out first, though really there had not been a chance 
before, and there would not have been another until goodness knows when. 
"stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks," read elrond, "and the setting sun with 
the last light of durin's day will shine upon the key-hole." 
"durin, durin!" said thorin. "he was the father of the fathers of the eldest race of 
dwarves, the longbeards, and my first ancestor: i a

m his heir." 
"then what is durin's day?" asked elrond. 
"the first day of the dwarves' new year," said thorin, "is as all should know the first, day 
of the last moon of autumn on the threshold of winter. we still call it durin's day when 
the last moon of autumn and the sun are in the sky together. but this will not help us 
much, i fear, for it passes our skill in these days to guess when such a time will come 
again." 
"that remains to be seen," said gandalf. "is there any more writing?" 
"none to be seen by this moon," said elrond, and he gave the map back to 

thorin; and then they went down to the water to see the elves dance and sing upon the 
midsummer's eve. 
the next morning was a midsummer's morning as fair and fresh as could be dreamed: 
blue sky and never a cloud, and the sun dancing on the water. now they rode away 
amid songs of farewell and good speed, with their hearts ready for more adventure, and 
with a knowledge of the road they

there were many paths that led up into those mountains, and many passes over them. 
but most of the paths were cheats and deceptions and led nowhere or to bad ends; and 
most of the passes were infested by evil things and dreadful dangers. the dwarves and 
the hobbit, helped by the wise advice of elrond and the knowledge and memory of 
gandalf, took the right road to the right pass. 
long days after they had climbed out of the valley and left the last homely house miles 
behind, they were still going up and up and up. it was a hard path and a dangerous path, 
a crooked way and a lonely and a long. now they could look back over the lands they 
had left, laid out behind them far below. far, far away in the west, where things were 
blue and faint, bilbo knew there lay his own country of safe and comfortable things, and

d blackberrying, before we even begin to go down the 
other side at this rate." and the others were thinking equally gloomy thoughts, although 
when they had said good-bye to elrond in the high hope of a midsummer morning, they' 
had spoken gaily of the passage of the mountains, and of riding swift across the lands 
beyond. they had thought of coming to the secret door in the lonely mountain, perhaps 
that very next first moon of autumn-" and perhaps it will be durin's day" they had said. 
only gandalf had shaken his head and said nothing. dwarves had not passed that way 
for many years, but gandalf had, and he knew how evil and danger had grown and 
thriven in the wild, since the dragons had driven men from the lands, and the goblins 
had spread in secret after the battle of the mines of moria. even the good plans of wise 
wizards like gandalf and of good friends like elrond go astray sometimes when you are 
off on dangerous adventures over the edge of the wild; and gandalf was a wise enough

otection at all. soon they were getting 
drenched and their ponies were standing with their heads down and their tails between 
their legs, and some of them were whinnying with fright. they could hear the giants 
guffawing and shouting all over the mountainsides. 
"this won't do at all!" said thorin. "if we don't get blown off or drowned, or struck by 
lightning, we shall be picked up by some giant and kicked sky-high for a football." 
"well, if you know of anywhere better, take us there!" said gandalf, who was feeling very 
grumpy, and was far from happy about the giants himself. 
the end of their argument was that they sent fill and kili to look for a better shelter. 
they had very sharp eyes, and being the youngest of the dwarves by some fifty years 
they usually got these sort of jobs (when everybody could see that it was absolutely no 
use sending bilbo). there is nothing like looking, if you want to find something (or so 
thorin said to the young dwarves). you certainly usually find som

ng no risks. he lit up his 
wand - as he did that day in bilbo's dining-room that seemed so long ago, if you 
remember-, and by its light they explored the cave from end to end. 
it seemed quite a fair size, but not too large and mysterious. it had a dry floor and some 
comfortable nooks. at one end there was room for the ponies; and there they stood 
(mighty glad of the change) steaming, and champing in their nosebags. oin and gloin 
wanted to light a fire at the door to dry their clothes, but gandalf would not hear of it. so 
they spread out their wet things on the floor, and got dry ones out of their bundles; then 
they made their blankets comfortable, got out their pipes and blew smoke rings, which 
gandalf turned into different colours and set dancing up by the roof to amuse them. 

they talked and talked, and forgot about the storm, and discussed what each would do 
with his share of the treasure (when they got it, which at the moment did not seem so 
impossible); and so they dropped o

out jumped the goblins, big goblins, great ugly-looking goblins, lots of goblins, before 
you could say rocks and blocks. there were six to each dwarf, at least, and two even for 
bilbo; and they were all grabbed and carried through the crack, before you could say 
tinder and flint. but not gandalf. 
bilbo's yell had done that much good. it had wakened him up wide in a splintered 
second, and when goblins came to grab him, there was a terrible flash like lightning in 
the cave, a smell like gunpowder, and several of them fell dead. 
the crack closed with a snap, and bilbo and the dwarves were on the wrong side of it! 
where was gandalf? of that neither they nor the goblins had any idea, and the goblins 
did not wait to find out. it was deep, deep, dark, such as only goblins that have take

goblin-drivers whooped and cracked their whips behind. the ponies were already there 
huddled in a corner; and there were all the baggages and packages lying broken open, 
and being rummaged by goblins, and smelt by goblins, and fingered by goblins, and 
quarreled over by goblins. 
i am afraid that was the last they ever saw of those excellent little ponies, including a 
jolly sturdy little white fellow that elrond had lent to gandalf, since his horse was not 
suitable for the mountain-paths. for goblins eat horses and ponies and donkeys (and 
other much more dreadful things), and they are always hungry. just now however the 
prisoners were thinking only of themselves. the goblins chained their hands behind their 
backs and linked them all together in a line and dragged them to the far end of the 
cavern with little bilbo tugging at the end of the row. 
there in the shadows on a large flat stone sat a tremendous goblin with

"quicker, quicker!" said the voice. "the torches will soon be relit." 
"half a minute!" said dori, who was at the back next to bilbo, and a decent fellow. he 
made the hobbit scramble on his shoulders as best he could with his tied hands, and 
then off they all went at a run, with a clink-clink of chains, and many a stumble, since 
they had no hands to steady themselves with. not for a long while did they stop, and by 
that time they must have been right down in the very mountain's heart. 
then gandalf lit up his wand. of course it was gandalf; but just then they were too busy 
to ask how he got there. he took out his sword again, and again it flashed in the dark by 

itself. it burned with a rage that made it gleam if goblins were about; now it was bright as 
blue flame for delight in the killing of the great lord of the cave. it made no trouble 
whatever of cutting through the goblin-chains and setting all the prisoners free as quickly 
as possible. this sword's name was glamdring the foe-

goblins just called it beater, and hated it worse than biter if possible. orcrist, too, had 
been saved; for gandalf had brought it along as well, snatching it from one of the 
terrified guards. gandalf thought of most things; and though he could not do everything, 
he could do a great deal for friends in a tight comer. 
"are we all here?" said he, handing his sword back to thorin with a bow.

on they went. gandalf was quite right: they began to hear goblin noises and horrible 
cries far behind in the passages they had come through. that sent them on faster than 
ever, and as poor bilbo could not possibly go half as fast-for dwarves can roll along at a 
tremendous pace, i can tell you, when they have to-they took it in turn to carry him on 
their backs. 
still goblins go faster than dwarves, and these goblins knew the way better (they had 
made the paths themselves), and were madly angry; so that do what

the blink of red torches could be seen behind them in the tunnel they were following;

down on bombur's back. 
"why, o why did i ever bring a wretched little hobbit on a treasure hunt!" said poor 
bombur, who was fat, and staggered along with the sweat dripping down his nose in his 
heat and terror. 
at this point gandalf fell behind, and thorin with him. they turned a sharp corner. "about 
turn!" he shouted. "draw your sword, thorin!" 
there was nothing else to be done; and the goblins did not like it. they came scurrying 
round the corner in full cry, and found goblin-cleaver and foehammer shining cold and 
bright right in their astonished eyes. the ones in front dropped their torches and gave

quite a long while before any of them dared to turn that comer. by that time the 
dwarves had gone on again, a long, long, way on into the dark tunnels of the goblins' 
realm. when the goblins discovered that, they put out their torches and they slipped on 
soft shoes, and they chose out their very quickest runners with the sharpest ears and 
eyes. these ran forward, as swift as weasels in the dark, and with hardly any more noise 
than bats. 
that is why neither bilbo, nor the dwarves, nor even gandalf heard them coming. nor 
did they see them. but they were seen by the goblins that ran silently up behind, for 
gandalf was letting his wand give out a faint light to help the dwarves as they went 
along. 

quite suddenly dori, now at the back again carrying bilbo, was grabbed from behind in 
the dark. he shouted and fell; and the hobbit rolled off his shoulders into the blackness, 
bumped his head on hard rock, and remembered nothing more.

ak, food, pony, his buttons and his friends. he wandered on and on, till the sun began 
to sink westwards-behind the mountains. their shadows fell across bilbo's path, and he 
looked back. then he looked forward and could see before him only ridges and slopes 
falling towards lowlands and plains glimpsed occasionally between the trees. 

"good heavens!" he exclaimed. "i seem to have got right to the other side of the misty 
mountains, right to the edge of the land beyond! where and o where can gandalf and 
the dwarves have got to? i only hope to goodness they are not still back there in the 
power of the goblins!" 
he still wandered on, out of the little high valley, over its edge, and down the slopes 
beyond; but all the while a very uncomfortable thought was growing inside him. he 
wondered whether he ought not, now he had the magic ring, to go back into the horrible, 
horrible, tunnels and look for his friends. he had just made up his mind that it was his 
duty, that he must turn back-and

he crept still nearer, and suddenly he saw peering between two big boulders a head with

but he did not. he had still got the ring on, for fear of meeting something unexpected and 
unpleasant, and he saw that balin was looking straight at him without noticing him. 
"i will give them all a surprise," he thought, as he crawled into the bushes at the edge of 
the dell. gandalf was arguing with the dwarves. they were discussing all that had 
happened to them in the tunnels, and wondering and debating what they were to do 
now. the dwarves were grumbling, and gandalf was saying that they could not possibly 
go on with their journey leaving mr. baggins in the hands of the goblins, without trying to 
find out if he was alive or dead, and without trying to rescue him. 
"after all he is my friend," said the wizard, "and not a bad little chap.

 wish to goodness you had not lost him." 
the dwarves wanted to know why he had ever been brought at all, why he could not 
stick to his friends and come along with them, and why the wizard had not chosen 
someone with more sense. "he has been more trouble than use so far," said one. "if we 
have got to' go back now into those abominable tunnels to look for him, then drat him, i 
say." 
gandalf answered angrily: "i brought him, and i don't bring things that are of no use. 
either you help me to look for him, or i go and leave you here to get out of the mess as 
best you can yourselves. if we can only find him again, you will thank me before all is 
over. whatever did you want to go and drop him for, dori?" 
"you would have dropped him," said dori, "if a goblin had suddenly grabbed your leg 
from behind in the dark, tripped up your feet, and kicked you in the back!" 
"then why didn't y

shouted 'follow me everybody!' and everybody ought to have followed. we thought 
everybody had. there was no time to count, as you know quite well, till we had dashed 
through the gate-guards, out of the lower door, and helter-skelter down here. and here 
we are-without the burglar, confusticate him!" 
"and here's the burglar!" said bilbo stepping down into the middle of them, and slipping 
off the ring. 
bless me, how they jumped! then they shouted with surprise and delight. 
gandalf was as astonished as any of them, but probably more pleased than all the 
others. he called to balin and told him what he thought of a look-out man who let people 

walk right into them like that without warning. it is a fact that bilbo's reputation went up a 
very great deal with the dwarves after this. 
if they had still doubted that he was really a first-class burglar, in spite of gandalf's 
words, they doubted no longer. balin was the most puzzled of all; but everyone said it

the gate." 
"what about guards?" they asked. "weren't there any?" 
"o yes! lots of them; but i dodged 'em. i got stuck in the door, which was only open a 
crack, and i lost lots of buttons," he said sadly looking at his torn clothes. "but i 
squeezed through all right-and here i am." 
the dwarves looked at him with quite a new respect, when he talked about dodging 
guards, jumping over gollum, and squeezing through, as if it was not very difficult or 
very alarming. 
"what did i tell you?" said gandalf laughing. "mr. baggins has more about him than you 
guess." he gave bilbo a queer look from under his bushy eyebrows, as he said this, and 
the hobbit wondered if he guessed at the part of his tale that he had left out. 
then he had questions of his own to ask, for if gandalf had explained it all by now to the 
dwarves, bilbo had not heard it. he wanted to know how the wizard had turned up again, 
and where they had all got to now. 
the wizard, to tell the truth, never minded explaining his cle

resence of 
evil goblins in that part of the mountains. but their main gate used to come out on a 
different pass, one more easy to travel by, so that they often caught people benighted 
near their gates. evidently people had given up going that way, and the goblins must 
have opened their new entrance at the top of the pass the dwarves had taken, quite 
recently, because it had been found quite safe up to now. 
"i must see if i can't find a more or less decent giant to block it up again," said gandalf, 
"or soon there will be no getting over the mountains at all." 
as soon as gandalf had heard bilbo's yell he realized what had happened. 
in the flash which killed the goblins that were grabbing him he had nipped inside the 
crack, just as it snapped to. he followed after the drivers and prisoners right to the edge 
of the great hall, and there he sat down and worked up the best magic he could in the 
shadows. 

"a very ticklish business, it was," he said. "touch and go!" 
but, of course, gan

dalf had made a special study of bewitchments with fire and lights 
(even the hobbit had never forgotten the magic fireworks at old took's midsummer-eve 
parties, as you remember). the rest we all know - except that gandalf knew all about the 
back-door, as the goblins called the lower gate, where bilbo lost his buttons. as a matter 
of fact it was well known to anybody who was acquainted with this part of the mountains; 
but it took a wizard to keep his head in the tunnels and guide them in the right 
direction. 
"they made that gate ages ago," he said, "partly for a way of escape, if they needed 
one; partly as a way out into the lands beyond, where they still come in the dark and do 
great damage. they guard it

quite a short cut. but we are not 
at the point to which our pass would have brought us; we are too far to the north, and 
have some awkward country ahead. and we are still pretty high up. let's get on!" 
"i am so dreadfully hungry," groaned bilbo, who was suddenly aware that he had not 
had a meal since the night before the night before last. just think of that for a hobbit! his 
stomach felt all empty and loose and his legs all wobbly, now that the excitement was 
over. 
"can't help it," said gandalf, "unless you like to go back and ask the goblins nicely to let 
you have your pony back and your luggage." 
"no thank you!" said bilbo. 
"very well then, we must just tighten our belts and trudge on - or we shall be made into 
supper, and that will be much worse than having none ourselves." 
as they went on bilbo looked from side to side for something to eat; but the blackberries 
were still only in flower, and of course there were no nuts, nor even hawthorn-berries. he 
nibbled a bit of sorrel

ood right up the mountain slope from the deeper darker forests 
of the valleys below. some caught hold of the trunks and swung themselves into lower 
branches, some (like the little hobbit) got behind a tree to shelter from the onslaught of 
the rocks. soon the danger was over, the slide had stopped, and the last faint crashes 
could be heard as the largest of the disturbed stones went bounding and spinning 
among the bracken and the pine-roots far below. 
"well! that has got us on a bit," said gandalf; "and even goblins tracking us will have a 
job to come down here quietly." 
"i daresay," grumbled bombur; "but they won't find it difficult to send stones bouncing 
down on our heads." the dwarves (and bilbo) were feeling far from happy, and were 
rubbing their bruised and damaged legs and feet. 
"nonsense! we are going to turn aside here out of the path of the slide. 
we must be quick! look at the light!" the sun had long gone behind the mountains. 
already the shadows were deepening about th

dles; and all the while the forest-gloom got heavier and the forest-silence deeper. 
there was no wind that evening to bring even a sea-sighing into the branches of the 
trees. 
"must we go any further?" asked bilbo, when it was so dark that he could only just see 
thorin's beard wagging beside him, and so quiet that he could hear the dwarves' 
breathing like a loud noise. "my toes are all bruised and bent, and my legs ache, and my 
stomach is wagging like an empty sack." 
"a bit further," said gandalf. 
after what seemed ages further they came suddenly to an opening where no trees grew. 
the moon was up and was shining into the clearing. somehow it struck all of them as 
not at all a nice place, although there was nothing wrong to see. 
all of a sudden they heard a howl away down hill, a long shuddering howl. 
it was answered by another away to the right and a good deal nearer to them; then by 
another not far away to the left. it was wolves howling at the moon, wolves gathering 
together!

specially against the evil packs that lived under the shadow of the 
goblininfested mountains, over the edge of the wild on the borders of the unknown. 
wolves of that sort smell keener than goblins, and do not need to see you to catch you! 
"what shall we do, what shall we do!" he cried. "escaping goblins to be caught by 
wolves!" he said, and it became a proverb, though we now say 'out of the frying-pan into 
the fire' in the same sort of uncomfortable situations. 
"up the trees quick!" cried gandalf; and they ran to the trees at the edge of the glade, 
hunting for those that had branches fairly low, or were slender enough to swarm up. 
they found them as quick as ever they could, you can guess; and up they went as high 
as ever they could trust the branches. you would have laughed (from a safe distance), if 
you had seen the dwarves sitting up in the trees with their beards dangling down, like old 
gentlemen gone cracked and playing at being boys. fili and kili were at the top of a tall

comfortable in a huge pine with regular branches sticking out at intervals like the spokes 
of a wheel. bifur, bofur, bombur, and thorin were in another. dwalin and balin had 
swarmed up a tall slender fir with few branches and were trying to find a place to sit in 
the greenery of the topmost boughs. 
gandalf, who was a good deal taller than the others, had found a tree into which they 
could not climb, a large pine standing at the very edge of the glade. he was quite hidden 
in its boughs, but you could see his eyes gleaming in the moon as he peeped out. 
and bilbo? he could not get into any tree, and was scuttling about from trunk to trunk, 
like a rabbit that has lost its hole and has a dog after it. 
"you've left the burglar behind again}" said nori to dori looking down.

 glade in the ring of trees was evidently a meeting-place of the wolves. more and 
more kept coming in. they left guards at the foot of the tree in which dori and bilbo 
were, and then went sniffling about till they had smelt out every tree that had anyone in 
it. these they guarded too, while all the rest (hundreds and hundreds it seemed) went 
and sat in a great circle in the glade; and in the middle of the circle was a great grey 
wolf. he spoke to them in the dreadful language of the wargs. gandalf understood it. 
bilbo did not, but it sounded terrible to him, and as if all their talk was about cruel and 
wicked things, as it was. every now and then all the wargs in the circle would answer 
their grey chief all together, and their dreadful clamour almost made the hobbit fall out of 
his pine-tree. 
i will tell you what gandalf heard, though bilbo did not understand it. 
the wargs and the goblins often helped one another in wicked deeds. goblins do not

n the bright day. but now they had planned 
with the goblins' help to come by night upon some of the villages nearest the mountains. 
if their plan had been carried out, there would have been none left there next day; all 
would have been killed except the few the goblins kept from the wolves and carried back 
as prisoners to their caves. 
this was dreadful talk to listen to, not only because of the brave woodmen and their 
wives and children, but also because of the danger which now threatened gandalf and 
his friends. the wargs were angry and puzzled at finding them here in their very 
meeting-place. they thought they were friends of the woodmen, and were come to spy 
on them, and would take news of their plans down into the valleys, and then the goblins 
and the wolves would have to fight a terrible battle instead of capturing prisoners and 
devouring people waked suddenly from their sleep. so the wargs had no intention of 
going away and letting the people up the trees escape, at any rate

 not until morning. and 
long before that, they said, goblin soldiers would be coming down from the mountains; 
and goblins can climb trees, or cut them down. 
now you can understand why gandalf, listening to their growling and yelping, began to 
be dreadfully afraid, wizard though he was, and to feel that they were in a very bad 
place, and had not yet escaped at all. all the same he was not going to let them have it 
all their own way, though he could not do very much stuck up in a tall tree with wolves all 
round on the ground below. 
he gathered the huge pinecones from the branches of his tree. then he set one alight 
with bright blue fire, and threw it whizzing down among the circ

"fifteen birds in five firtrees, 
their feathers were fanned in a fiery breeze! 
but, funny little birds, they had no wings! 
o what shall we do with the funny little things? 
roast 'em alive, or stew them in a pot; 
fry them, boil them and eat them hot?" 
 
then they stopped and shouted out: "fly away little birds! fly away if you can! come 
down little birds, or you will get roasted in your nests! sing, sing little birds! why don't 
you sing?" 

"go away! little boys!" shouted gandalf in answer. "it isn't bird-nesting time. also 
naughty little boys that play with fire get punished." he said it to make them angry, and 
to show them he was not frightened of them-though of course he was, wizard though he 
was. but they took no notice, and they went on singing.

and with that ya hoy! the flames were under gandalf's tree. in a moment it spread to the 
others. the bark caught fire, the lower branches cracked. 
then gandalf climbed to the top of his tree. the sudden splendour flashed from his 
wand like lightning, as he got ready to spring down from on high right among the spears 
of the goblins. that would have been the end of him, though he would probably have 
killed many of them as he came hurtling down like a thunderbolt. but he never leaped. 
just at that moment the lord of the eagles swept down from above, seized him in his 
talons, and was gone. 
there was a howl of anger and surprise from the goblins. lou

eagles, to whom gandalf had now spoken. back swept the great birds that were with 
him, and down they came like huge black shadows. the wolves yammered and gnashed 
their teeth; the goblins yelled and stamped with rage, and flung their heavy spears in the 
air in vain. over them swooped the eagles; the dark rush of their beating wings smote 
them to the floor or drove them far away; their talons tore at goblin faces. other birds 
flew to the tree-tops and seized the dwarves, who were scrambling up now as far as 
ever

soon bilbo was laid down, trembling with fear, on a wide shelf of rock on the mountain-
side. there was no path down on to it save by flying; and no path down off it except by 
jumping over a precipice. there he found all the others sitting with their backs to the 
mountain wall. the lord of the eagles also was there and was speaking to gandalf. 
it seemed that bilbo was not going to be eaten after all. the wizard and the eagle-lord 
appeared to know one another slightly, and even to be on friendly terms. as a matter of 
fact gandalf, who had often been in the mountains, had once rendered a service to the 
eagles and healed their lord from an arrow-wound. so you see 'prisoners' had meant 
'prisoners rescued from the goblins' only, and not captives of the eagles. as bilbo 
listened to the talk of gandalf he realized that at last they w

 and bilbo far away and setting them 
down well on their journey across the plains below. 
the lord of the eagles would not take them anywhere near where men lived. 
"they would shoot at us with their great bows of yew," he said, "for they would think we 
were after their sheep. and at other times they would be right. 
no! we are glad to cheat the goblins of their sport, and glad to repay our thanks to you, 
but we will not risk ourselves for dwarves in the southward plains." 
"very well," said gandalf. "take us where and as far as you will! we are already deeply 
obliged to you. but in the meantime we are famished with hunger." 
"i am nearly dead of it," said bilbo in a weak little voice that nobody heard. 

"that can perhaps be mended," said the lord of the eagles. 
later on you might have seen a bright fire on the shelf of rock and the figures of the 
dwarves round it cooking and making a fine roasting smell. the eagles had brought up 
dry boughs for fuel, and they had brought rabbits, ha

res, and a small sheep. the 
dwarves managed all the preparations. bilbo was too weak to help, and anyway he was 
not much good at skinning rabbits or cutting up meat, being used to having it delivered 
by the butcher all ready to cook. gandalf, too, was lying down after doing his part in 
setting the fire going, since oin and gloin had lost their tinder-boxes. (dwarves have 
never taken to matches even yet.) 
so ended the adventures of the misty mountains. soon bilbo's stomach was feeling full 
and comfortable again, and he felt he could sleep contentedly, though really he would 
have liked a loaf and butter better than bits of meat toasted on sticks. he slept curled up 
on the hard rock more soundly than ever he had done on his feat

 it, was a great rock, almost a hill of stone, like a 
last outpost of the distant mountains, or a huge piece cast miles into the plain by some 
giant among giants. 
quickly now to the top of this rock the eagles swooped one by one and set down their 
passengers. 
"farewell!" they cried, "wherever you fare, till your eyries receive you at the journey's 
end!" that is the polite thing to say among eagles. 
"may the wind under your wings bear you where the sun sails and the moon walks," 
answered gandalf, who knew the correct reply. 

and so they parted. and though the lord of the eagles became in after days the king of 
all birds and wore a golden crown, and his fifteen chieftains golden collars (made of the 
gold that the dwarves gave them), bilbo never saw them again - except high and far off 
in the battle of five armies. but as that comes in at the end of this tale we will say no 
more about it just now. 
there was a flat space on the top of the hill of stone and a well worn path with man

"i always meant to see you all safe (if possible) over the mountains," said the wizard, 
"and now by good management and good luck i have done it. 
indeed we are now a good deal further east than i ever meant to come with you, for after 
all this is not my adventure. i may look in on it again before it is all over, but in the 
meanwhile i have some other pressing business to attend to." 
the dwarves groaned and looked most distressed, and bilbo wept. they had begun to 
think gandalf was going in come all the way and would always be there to help them out 
of difficulties. "i am not going to disappear this very instant," said he. "i can give you a 
day or two more. probably i can help you out of your present plight, and i need a little 
help myself. we have no food, and no baggage, and no ponies to ride; and you don't 
know where you are. now i can tell you that. you are still some miles north of the path

"couldn't you find someone more easy-tempered? hadn't you better explain it all a bit 
clearer?"-and so on. 

"yes it certainly is! no i could not! and i was explaining very carefully," answered the 
wizard crossly. "if you must know more, his name is 
beorn. he is very strong, and he is a skin-changer." 
"what! a furrier, a man that calls rabbits conies, when he doesn't turn their skins into 
squirrels?" asked bilbo. 
"good gracious heavens, no, no, no, no!" said gandalf. "don't be a fool mr. baggins if 
you can help it; and in the name of all wonder don't mention the word furrier again as 
long as you are within a hundred miles of his house, nor, rug, cape, tippet, muff, nor any 
other such unfortunate word! he is a skin-changer. he changes his skin; sometimes he 
is a huge black bear, sometimes he is a great strong black-haired man with huge arms 
and a great beard. i cannot tell you much more, though that ought to be enough. some

 and purple clover, 
and wide stretches of short white sweet honey-smelling clover. there was a buzzing and 
a whirring and a droning in the air. bees were busy everywhere. and such bees! bilbo 
had never seen anything like them. 
"if one was to sting me," he thought, "i should swell up as big again as i am!" 
they were bigger than hornets. the drones were bigger than your thumb, a good deal, 
and the bands of yellow on their deep black bodies shone like fiery gold. 
"we are getting near," said gandalf. "we are on the edge of his beepastures." 
after a while they came to a belt of tall and very ancient oaks, and beyond these to a 
high thorn-hedge through which you could neither see nor scramble. 
"you had better wait here," said the wizard to the dwarves; "and when i call or whistle 
begin to come after me - you will see the way i go-but only in pairs, mind, about five 
minutes between each pair of you. bombur is fattest and will do for two, he had better

ere rows and rows of hives with bell-
shaped tops made of straw. the noise of the giant bees flying to and fro and crawling in 
and out filled all the air. 
the wizard and the hobbit pushed open the heavy creaking gate and went down a wide 
track towards the house. some horses, very sleek and well-groomed, trotted up across 
the grass and looked at them intently with very intelligent faces; then off they galloped to 
the buildings. 
"they have gone to tell him of the arrival of strangers," said gandalf. 
soon they reached a courtyard, three walls of which were formed by the wooden house 
and its two long wings. in the middle there was lying a great oak-trunk with many lopped 
branches beside it. standing near was a huge man with a thick black beard and' hair, 
and great bare arms and legs with knotted muscles. he was clothed in a tunic of wool 
down to his knees, and was leaning on a large axe. 
the horses were standing by him with their noses at his shoulder. 
"ugh! here they are!" he said t

o the horses. "they don't look dangerous. 
you can be off!" he laughed a great rolling laugh, put down his axe and came forward. 
"who are you and what do you want?" he asked gruffly, standing in front of them and 
towering tall above gandalf. 
as for bilbo he could easily have trotted through his legs without ducking his head to 
miss the fringe of the man's brown tunic. 
"i am gandalf," said the wizard. 
"never heard of him," growled the man, "and what's this little fellow?" he said, stooping 
down to frown at the hobbit with his bushy eyebrows. 
"that is mr. baggins, a hobbit of good family and unimpeachable reputation," said 
gandalf. bilbo bowed. he had no hat to take off, and was painfully conscious of his 
many missing buttons. "i am a wizard," continued gandalf. "i have heard of you, if you 
have not heard of me; but perhaps you have heard of my good cousin radagast wh

blackened rafters in search of the way out through an opening in the roof. they passed 
through this dim hall, lit only by the fire and the hole above it, and came through another 
smaller door into a sort of veranda propped on wooden posts made of single tree-trunks. 
it faced south and was still warm and filled with the light of the westering sun which 
slanted into it, and fell golden on the garden full of flowers that came right up to 
the steps. 

here they sat on wooden benches while gandalf began his tale, and bilbo swung his 
dangling legs and looked at the flowers in the garden, wondering what their names could 
be, as he had never seen half of them before. 
"i was coming over the mountains with a friend or two..." said the wizard. 
"or two? i can only see one, and a little one at that," said beorn. 
"well to tell you the truth, i did not like to bother you with a lot of us, until i found out if 
you were busy. i will give a call, if i may." 
"go on, call away!" 
so gandalf gave

dwarves bowing again. 
"i don't need your service, thank you," said beorn, "but i expect you need mine. i am not 
over fond of dwarves; but if it is true you are thorin (son of thrain, son of thror, i 
believe), and that your companion is respectable, and that you are enemies of goblins 
and are not up to any mischief in my lands-what are you up to, by the way?" 
"they are on their way to visit the land of their fathers, away east beyond mirkwood," put 
in gandalf, "and it is entirely an accident that we are in your lands at all. we were 
crossing by the high pass that should have brought us to the road that lies to the south 
of your country, when we were attacked by the evil goblins-as i was about to tell you." 
"go on telling, then!" said beorn, who was never very polite. 
"there was a terrible storm; the stone-giants were out hurling rocks, and at the head of 
the pass we took refuge in a cave, the hob bit and i and several of our companions..." 
"do

"well, no. as a matter of fact there were more than two." 
"where are they? killed, eaten, gone home?" 
"well, no. they don't seem all to have come when i whistled. shy, i expect. you see, we 
are very much afraid that we are rather a lot for you to entertain." 
"go on, whistle again! i am in for a party, it seems, and one or two more won't make 
much difference," growled beorn. 
gandalf whistled again; but nori and ori were there almost before he had stopped, for, if 
you remember, gandalf had told them to come in pairs every five minutes. 
"hullo!" said beorn. "you came pretty quick-where were you hiding? come on my jack-
in-the-boxes!" 
"nori at your service, ori at . . ." they began; but beorn interrupted them. 
"thank you! when i want your help i will ask for it. sit down, and let's get on with this 
tale, or it will be supper-time before it is ended."

 asleep," went on gandalf, "a crack at the back of the cave opened; 
goblins came out and grabbed the hobbit and the dwarves and our troop of ponies-" 
"troop of ponies? what were you-a travelling circus? or were you carrying lots of 
goods? or do you always call six a troop?" 
"o no! as a matter of fact there were more than six ponies, for there were more than six 
of us-and well, here are two more!" just at that moment balin and dwalin appeared and 
bowed so low that their beards swept the stone floor. the big man was

e crack before it closed. i followed down into the main hall, which 
was crowded with goblins. the great goblin was there with thirty or forty armed guards. 
i thought to myself 'even if they were not all chained together, what can a dozen do 
against so many?' " 
"a dozen! that's the first time i've heard eight called a dozen. or have you still got some 
more jacks that haven't yet come out of their boxes?" 
"well, yes, there seem to be a couple more here now - fili and kili, i believe," said 
gandalf, as these two now appeared and stood smiling and bowing. 
"that's enough!" said beorn. "sit down and be quiet! now go on, gandalf!" 
so gandalf went on with the tale, until he came to the fight in the dark, the discovery of 
the lower gate, and their horror when they found that mr. baggins had been mislaid. 
"we counted ourselves and found that there was no hobbit. there were only fourteen of 
us left!" 
"fourteen! that's the first time i've heard one from ten leave fourteen.

"well, of course you haven't seen oin and gloin yet. and, bless me! here they are. i

"o let 'em all come! hurry up! come along, you two, and sit down! but look here, 
gandalf, even now we have only got yourself and ten dwarves and the hobbit that was 
lost. that only makes eleven (plus one mislaid) and not fourteen, unless wizards count 
differently to other people. but now please get on with the tale." beorn did not show it 
more than he could help, but really he had begun to get very interested. you see, in the 
old days he had known the very part of the mountains that gandalf was describing. he

their climbing into trees with the wolves all underneath, he got up and strode about 
and muttered: 
"i wish i had been there! i would have given them more than fireworks!" 
"well," said gandalf very glad to see that his tale was making a good impression, "i did 
the best i could. there we were with the wolves going mad underneath us and the forest 
beginning to blaze in places, when the goblins came down from the hills and discovered 
us. they yelled with delight and sang songs making fun of us. fifteen birds in five fir-
trees..." 
"good heavens!" growled beorn. "don't pretend that goblins can't count. 
they can. twelve isn't fifteen and they know it." 
"and so do 1. there were bifur

in came bifur and bofur. "and me!" gasped bombur pulling up behind. he was fat, and 
also angry at being left till last. he refused to wait five minutes, and followed immediately 
after the other two. 
"well, now there are fifteen of you; and since goblins can count, i suppose that is all that 
there were up the trees. now perhaps we can finish this story without any more 
interruptions." mr. baggins saw then how clever gandalf had been. the interruptions 

had really made beorn more interested in the story, and the story had kept him from 
sending the dwarves off at once like suspicious beggars. he never invited people into his 
house, if he could help it. he had very few friends and they lived a good way away; and 
he never invited more than a couple of these to his house at a time. now he had got 
fifteen strangers sitting in his porch!

then baa-baa-baa! was heard, and in came some snow-white sheep led by a large coal-
black ram. one bore a white cloth embroidered at the edges with figures of animals; 
others bore on their broad backs trays with bowls and platters and knives and wooden 
spoons, which the dogs took and quickly laid on the trestle tables. these were very low, 
low enough even for bilbo to sit at comfortably. beside them a pony pushed two low-
seated benches with wide rushbottoms and little short thick legs for gandalf and thorin, 
while at the far end he put beorn's big black chair of the same sort (in which he sat with 
his great legs stuck far out under the table). these were all the chairs he had in his hall, 
and he probably had them low like the tables for the convenience of the wonderful 
animals that waited on him. what did the rest sit on? they were not forgotten. the other 
ponies came in rolling round drum-shaped sections of logs, smoothed and polished, and 
low enough even for bilbo; so soon they

bilbo began to nod again. suddenly up stood gandalf. "it is time for us to sleep," be 
said, "-for us, but not i think for beorn. in this hall we can rest sound and safe, but i warn 
you all not to forget what beorn said before he left us: you must not stray outside until 
the sun is up, on your peril." 
bilbo found that beds had already been laid at the side of the hall, on a sort of raised 
platform between the pillars and the outer wall. for him there was a little mattress of 
straw and woollen blankets. he snuggled into them very gladly, sum

mertime though it 
was. the fire burned low and he fell asleep. 
yet in the night he woke: the fire had now sunk to a few embers; the dwarves and 
gandalf were all asleep, to judge by their breathing; a splash of white on the floor came 
from the high moon, which was peering down through the smokehole in the roof. 
there was a growling sound outside, and a noise as of some great animal scuffling at 
the door. bilbo .wondered what it was, and whether it could be beorn in enchanted 
shape, and if he would come in as a bear and kill them. 
he dived under the blankets and hid his head, and fell asleep again at last in spite of his 
fears.

 bofur, and he was grumbling about it, when bilbo opened his eyes. 
"get up lazybones," he said, "or there will be no breakfast left for you." 
up jumped bilbo. "breakfast!" he cried. "where is breakfast?" 
"mostly inside us," answered the other dwarves who were moving around the hall; "but 
what is left is out on the veranda. we have been about looking for beorn ever since the 
sun got up; but there is no sign of him anywhere, though we found breakfast laid as soon 
as we went out." 
"where is gandalf?" asked bilbo, moving off to find something to eat as quick as he 
could. 
"o! out and about somewhere," they told him. but he saw no sign of the wizard all that 
day until the evening. just before sunset he walked into the hall, where the hobbit and 
the dwarves were having supper, waited on by beorn's wonderful animals, as they had 
been all day. of beorn they had seen and heard nothing since the night before, and they 
were getting puzzled. 
"where is our host, and where have you been all da

y yourself?" they all cried. 
"one question at a time-and none till after supper! i haven't had a bite since breakfast." 
at last gandalf pushed away his plate and jug - he had eaten two whole loaves (with 
masses of butter and honey and clotted cream) and drunk at least a quart of mead and 
he took out his pipe. "i will answer the second question first," he said, "-but bless me! 
this is a splendid place for smoke rings!" 
indeed for a long time they could get nothing more out of him, he was so busy sending 
smoke-rings dodging round the pillars of the hall, changing them into all sorts of different 
shapes and colours, and sett

and then miles back again to pick up the tracks again. by that time it was too late for me 
to follow them far. 
they went straight off in the direction of the pine-woods on the east side of the misty 
mountains, where we had our pleasant little party with the wargs the night before last. 
and now i think i have answered your first question, too," ended gandalf, and he sat a 
long while silent. 
bilbo thought he knew what the wizard meant. "what shall we do," he cried, "if he leads 
all the wargs and the goblins down here? we shall all be caught and killed! i thought 
you said he was not 9 friend of theirs." 

"so i did. and don't be silly! you had better go to bed, your wits are sleepy." 
the hobbit felt quite crushed, and as there seemed nothing else to do he did go to bed; 
and while the dwarves were still singing songs he dropped asleep, still pu

"what did you do with the goblin and the warg?" asked bilbo suddenly. 
"come and see!" said beorn, and they followed round the house. a goblin's head was 
stuck outside the gate and a warg-skin was nailed to a tree just beyond. beorn was a 
fierce enemy. but now he was their friend, and gandalf thought it wise to tell him their 
whole story and the reason of their journey, so that they could get the most help he 
could offer. 
this is what he promised to do for them. he would provide ponies for each of them, and 
a horse for gandalf, for their journey to the forest, and he would lade them with food to 
last them for weeks with care, and packed so as to be as easy as possible to carry-nuts, 
flour, sealed jars of dried fruits, and red earthenware pots of honey, and twice-baked 
cakes t

e harts sticking up out of the long grass, and at first he thought they were the 
dead branches of trees. that third evening they were so eager to press on, for beorn 
had said that they should reach the forest-gate early on the fourth day, that they rode still 
forward after dusk and into the night beneath the moon. as the light faded bilbo thought 
he saw away to the right, or to the left, the shadowy form of a great bear prowling along 
in the same direction. but if he dared to mention it to gandalf, the wizard only said: 
"hush! take no notice!" 
next day they started before dawn, though their night had been short. as soon as it was 
light they could see the forest coming as it were to meet them, or waiting for them like a 
black and frowning wall before them. the land began to slope up and up, and it seemed 
to the hobbit that a silence began to draw in upon them. birds began to sing less. there 
were no more deer; not even rabbits were to be seen. by the afternoon they had 
reached the

eaves of mirkwood, and were resting almost beneath the great overhanging 
boughs of its outer trees. their trunks were huge and gnarled, their branches twisted, 
their leaves were dark and long. ivy grew on them and trailed along the ground. 
"well, here is mirkwood!" said gandalf. "the greatest of the forests of the northern 
world. i hope you like the look of it. now you must send back these excellent ponies you 
have borrowed." 
the dwarves were inclined to grumble at this, but the wizard told them they were fools. 
"beorn is not as far off as you seem to think, and you had better keep your promises 
anyway, for he is a bad enemy. mr. baggins' eyes are sharper than yours, if you have 
not seen each night after dark a great bear going along with us or sitting far of in

too. beorn may be your friend, but he loves his animals as his children. you 
do not guess what kindness he has shown you in letting dwarves ride them so far and so 
fast, nor what would happen to you, if you tried to take them into the forest." 
"what about the horse, then?" said thorin. "you don't mention sending that back." 
"i don't, because i am not sending it." 
"what about your promise then?" 
"i will look after that. i am not sending the horse back, i am riding it!" 
then they knew that gandalf was going to leave them at the very edge of 
mirkwood, and they were in despair. 
but nothing they could say would change his mind. 
"now we had this all out before, when we landed on the carrock," he said. 
"it is no use arguing. i have, as i told you, some pressing business away south; and i am 
already late through bothering with you people. we may meet again before all is over, 
and then again of course we may not. that depends on your luck and on your courage 
and sense; and i am sending m

all that on his back. 
"don't you worry!" said thorin. "it will get lighter all too soon. before long i expect we 
shall all wish our packs heavier, when the food begins to run short." 
then at last they said good-bye to their ponies and turned their heads for home. off they 
trotted gaily, seeming very glad to put their tails towards the shadow of mirkwood. as 
they went away bilbo could have sworn that a thing like a bear left the shadow of the 
trees and shambled off quickly after them. 
now gandalf too said farewell. bilbo sat on the ground feeling very unhappy and wishing 
he was beside the wizard on his tall horse. he had gone just inside the forest after 
breakfast (a very poor one), and it had seemed as dark in there in the morning as at 
night, and very secret: "a sort of watching and waiting feeling," he said to himself. 
"good-bye!" said gandalf to thorin. "and good-bye to you all, good-bye! 
straight through the forest is your way now. don't stray off the track!-if you do, it is a

dear old smaug lives, though i hope he is not expecting you." 
"very comforting you are to be sure," growled thorin. "good-bye! if you won't come with 
us, you had better get off without any more talk!" 
"good-bye then, and really good-bye!" said gandalf, and he turned his horse and rode 
down into the west. but he could not resist the temptation to have the last word. before 
he had passed quite out of hearing he turned and put his hands to his mouth and called 
to them. they heard his voice come faintly: "good-bye! be good, take care of 
yourselves-and don't leave the path!" 
then he galloped away and was soon lost to sight. "o good-bye and go away!" grunted 
the dwarves, all the more angry because they were really filled with dismay at losin

d to it, "and i shall call you sting." 
after that he set out to explore. the forest was grim and silent, but obviously he had first 
of all to look for his friends, who were not likely to be very far off, unless they had been 
made prisoners by the elves (or worse things). 
bilbo felt that it was unsafe to shout, and he stood a long while wondering in what 
direction the path lay, and in what direction he should go first to look for the dwarves. "o! 
why did we not remember beorn's advice, and gandalf's!" he lamented. "what a mess 
we are in now! we! i only wish it was we: it is horrible being all alone." 
in the end he made as good a guess as he could at the direction from which the cries for 
help had come in the night - and by luck (he was born with a good share of it) be 
guessed more or less right, as you will see. having made up his mind he crept along as 
cleverly as he could. hobbits are clever at quietness, especially in woods, as 1. have

with the ring in its proper place. but after a time the light began to fail, and then other 
questions were asked. where were they, and where was their path, and where was 
there any food, and what were they going to do next? these questions they asked over 
and over again, and it was from little bilbo that they seemed to expect to get the 
answers. from which you can see that they had changed their opinion of mr. baggins 
very much, and had begun to have a great respect for him (as gandalf had said they 
would). indeed they really expected him to think of some wonderful plan for helping 
them, and were not merely grumbling. they knew only too well that they would soon all 
have been dead, if it had not been for the hobbit; and they thanked him many times. 
some of them even got up and bowed right to the ground before him, though they fell 
over with the effort, and could not get on their legs again for some time. knowing the

other way had disappeared; until in fact the remarkable mr. invisible baggins (of whom 
he began to have a very high opinion indeed) had altogether failed to think of 
something clever. 
the other dwarves quite agreed when they got the message. they all thought their own 
shares in the treasure (which they quite regarded as theirs, in spite of their plight and the 
still unconquered dragon) would suffer seriously if the wood-elves claimed part of it, and 
they all trusted bilbo. 
just what gandalf had said would happen, you see. perhaps that war part of his reason 
for going off and leaving them. 

bilbo, however, did not feel nearly so hopeful as they did. he did not like being 
depended on by everyone, and he wished he had the wizard at hand. 
but that was no use: probably all the dark distance of mirkwood lay between them. he 
sat and thought and thought, until his head nearly burst, but no bright idea would come.

 grunted or whispered in the 
dark. "drat this dwarvish racket!" he said to himself. but all went well, and they met no 
guards. as a matter of fact there was a great autumn feast in the woods that night, and 
in the halls above. nearly all the king's folks were merrymaking. at last after much 
blundering they came to thorin's dungeon, far down in a deep place and fortunately not 
far from the cellars. 
"upon my word!" said thorin, when bilbo whispered to him to come out and join his 
friends, "gandalf spoke true, as usual. a pretty fine burglar you make, it seems, when 
the time comes. i am sure we are all for ever at your service, whatever happens after 
this. but what comes next?" 
bilbo saw that the time had come to explain his idea, as far as he could; but he did not 
feel at all sure bow the dwarves would take it. his fears were quite justified, for they did 
not like it a bit, and started grumbling loudly in spite of their danger.

waterways and the growth of the traffic on the river, as the roads out of the east towards 
mirkwood vanished or fell into disuse; and of the bickerings of the lake-men and the 
wood-elves about the upkeep of the forest river and the care of the banks. 
those lands had changed much since the days when dwarves dwelt in the mountain, 
days which most people now remembered only as a very shadowy tradition. they had 
changed even in recent years, and since the last news that gandalf had had of them. 
great floods and rains had swollen the waters that flowed east; and there had been an 
earthquake or two (which some were inclined to attribute to the dragon-alluding to him 
chiefly with a curse and an ominous nod in the direction of the mountain). the marshes 
and bogs had spread wider and wider on either side. paths had vanished, and many a 
rider and wanderer too, if they had tried to find the lost ways across. the elf-road

on the advice of beorn now came to a 
doubtful and little used end at the eastern edge of the forest; only the river offered any 
longer a safe way from the skirts of mirkwood in the north to the mountain-shadowed 
plains beyond, and the river was guarded by the wood-elves' king. 
so you see bilbo had come in the end by the only road that was any good. 
it might have been some comfort to mr. baggins shivering on the barrels, if he had 
known that news of this had reached gandalf far away and given him great anxiety, and 
that he was in fact finishing his other business (which does not come into this tale) and 
getting ready to come in search of thorin's company. 
but bilbo did not know it. 
all he knew was that the river seemed to go on and on and on for ever, and he was 
hungry, and had a nasty cold in the nose, and did not like the way the mountain seemed 
to frown at him and threaten him as it drew ever nearer. 
after a while, however, the river took a more southerl

nothing they could say would stop him; so an escort was provided for him, and as he 
went both the king and bard saluted him with honour. as they passed through the camp 
an old man wrapped in a dark cloak, rose from a tent door where he was sitting and 
came towards them. 
"well done! mr. baggins!" he said, clapping bilbo on the back. "there is always more 
about you than anyone expects!" it was gandalf. 
for the first time for many a day bilbo was really delighted. but there was no time for all 
the questions that he immediately wished to ask. 
"all in good time!" said gandalf. "things are drawing towards the end now, unless i am 
mistaken. there is an unpleasant time just in front of you; but keep your heart up! you 
may come through all right. there is news brewing that even the ravens have not heard.

"we are not thieves," bard answered. "your own we will give back in return for our own." 
'how came you by it?" shouted thorin in gathering rage. 
"i gave it them!" squeaked bilbo, who was peeping over the wall, by now, in a dreadful 
fright. 
"you! you!" cried thorin, turning upon him and grasping him with both hands. "you 
miserable hobbit! you undersized-burglar!" he shouted at a loss for words, and he shook 
poor bilbo like a rabbit. 
"by the beard of durin! i wish i had gandalf here! curse him for his choice of you! may 
his beard wither! as for you i will throw you to the rocks!" he cried and lifted bilbo in his 
arms. 
"stay! your wish is granted!" said a voice. the old man with the casket threw aside his 
hood and cloak. "here is gandalf! and none too soon it seems. 
if you don't like my burglar, please don't damage him. put him down, and listen first to 
what he has to say!"

"that shall follow after, as can be arranged," said he. 
"get down!" 
"until then we keep the stone," cried bard. 
"you are not making a very splendid figure as king under the mountain," said gandalf. 
"but things may change yet." 
"they may indeed," said thorin. and already, so strong was the bewilderment of the 
treasure upon him, he was pondering whether by the help of dain he might not recapture 
the arkenstone and withhold the share of the reward. 
and so bilbo was swung down from the wall, and departed with nothing for all his 
trouble, except the armour which thorin had given him already. more than one of the 
dwarves 'in their hearts felt shame and pity at his going.

arrows whistled; battle was about to be joined. 
still more suddenly a darkness came on with dreadful swiftness! a black cloud hurried 
over the sky. winter thunder on a wild wind rolled roaring up and rumbled in the 
mountain, and lightning lit its peak. and beneath the thunder another blackness could be 
seen whirling forward; but it did not come with the wind, it came from the north, like a 
vast cloud of birds, so dense that no light could be seen between their wings. 

"halt!" cried gandalf, who appeared suddenly, and stood alone, with arms uplifted, 
between the advancing dwarves and the ranks awaiting them. "halt!" he called in a voice 
like thunder, and his staff blazed forth with a flash like the lightning. "dread has come 
upon you all! alas! it has come more swiftly than i guessed. the goblins are upon you! 
bolg of the north is coming. 
o dain! whose father you slew in moria. behold! the bats are above his army like a sea

amazement and confusion fell upon them all. even as gandalf had been speaking the 
darkness grew. the dwarves halted and gazed at the sky. the elves cried out with many 
voices. 
"come!" called gandalf. "there is yet time for council. let dain son of nain come swiftly 
to us!" 
so began a battle that none had expected; and it was called the battle of five armies, 
and it was very terrible. upon one side were the goblins and the wild wolves, and upon 
the other were elves and men and dwarves. this is how it fell out. ever since the fall of 
the great goblin of the misty mountains the hatred of their race for the dwarves had 
been rekindled to fury. messengers had passed to and fro between all

ntain gundabad of the north, where was their 
capital, a vast host was assembled ready to sweep down in time of storm unawares 
upon the south. then they learned of the death of smaug, and joy was in their hearts: 
and they hastened night after night through the mountains, and came thus at last on a 
sudden from the north hard on the heels of dain. not even the ravens knew of their 
coming until they came out in the broken lands which divided the lonely mountain from 
the hills behind. how much gandalf knew cannot be said, but it is plain that he had not 
expected this sudden assault. 
this is the plan that he made in council with the elvenking and with bard; and with dain, 
for the dwarf-lord now joined them: the goblins were the foes of all, and at their coming 
all other quarrels were forgotten. their only hope was to lure the goblins into the valley 
between the arms of the mountain; and themselves to man the great spurs that struck 
south and east. yet this would be perilous, if the gobl

and elves climbed to the height of the eastern shoulder to gain a view to the north. soon 
they could see the lands before the mountain's feet black with a hurrying multitude. ere 
long the vanguard swirled round the spur's end and came rushing into dale. these were 
the swiftest wolfriders, and already their cries and howls rent the air afar. a few brave 
men were strung before them to make a feint of resistance, and many there fell before 
the rest drew back and fled to either side. as gandalf had hoped, the goblin army had 
gathered behind the resisted vanguard, and poured now in rage into the valley, driving 

wildly up between the arms of the mountain, seeking for the foe. their banners were 
countless, black and red, and they came on like a tide in fury and disorder. 
it was a terrible battle. the most dreadful of all bilbo's experiences, and the one which at 
the time he hated most - which is to say it was the one he was most proud of, and most

s of sand. their friends could not help them, for the assault 
from the mountain was renewed with redoubled force, and upon either side men and 
elves were being slowly beaten down. 
on all this bilbo looked with misery. he had taken his stand on ravenhill among the 
elves-partly because there was more chance of escape from that point, and partly (with 
the more tookish part of his mind) because if he was going to be in a last desperate 
stand, he preferred on the whole to defend the elvenking. gandalf, too, i may say, was 
there, sitting on the ground as if in deep thought, preparing, i suppose, some last blast of 
magic before the end. 
that did not seem far off. "it will not be long now," thought bilbo, "before the goblins win 
the gate, and we are all slaughtered or driven down and captured. really it is enough to 
make one weep, after all one has gone through. i would rather old smaug had been left

then bilbo remembered his ring! "well i'm blessed!" said he. "this invisibility has its 
drawbacks after all. otherwise i suppose i might have spent a warm and comfortable 
night in bed!" 
"it's me, bilbo baggins, companion of thorin!" he cried, hurriedly taking 
off the ring. 
"it is well that i have found you!" said the man striding forward. "you are needed and we 
have looked for you long. you would have been numbered among the dead, who are 
many, if gandalf the wizard had not said that your voice was last heard in this place. i 
have been sent to look here for the last time. are you much hurt?" 
"a nasty knock on the head, i think," said bilbo. "but i have a helm and a hard skull. all 
the same i feel sick and my legs are like straws." 
"i will carry you down to the camp in the valley," said the man, and picked him lightly up.

victory had been assured before the fall of night, but the pursuit was still on foot, when 
bilbo returned to the camp; and not many were in the valley save the more grievously 
wounded.

warm blankets.

would not stay here, and departed with the first light of morning. dain has crowned their 
chief with gold, and sworn friendship with them for ever." 
"i am sorry. i mean, i should have liked to see them again," said bilbo sleepily; "perhaps 
i shall see them on the way home. i suppose i shall be going home soon?" 
"as soon as you like," said the wiza

n, 
when our halls are made fair once more, then the feast shall indeed be splendid!" 
"if ever you are passing my way," said bilbo, "don't wait to knock! tea is at four; but any 
of you are welcome at any time!" 
then he turned away. 
the elf-host was on the march;. and if it was sadly lessened, yet many were glad, for 
now the northern world would be merrier for many a long day. 
the dragon was dead, and the goblins overthrown, and their hearts looked forward after 
winter to a spring of joy. gandalf and bilbo rode behind the elvenking, and beside them 
strode beorn, once again in man's shape, and he laughed and sang in a loud voice upon 
the road. so they went on until they drew near to the borders of mirkwood, to the north of 
the place where the forest river ran out. 
then they halted, for the wizard and bilbo would not enter the wood, even though the 
king bade them stay a while in his halls. they intended to go along the edge of the 
forest, and round its northern end in the waste that

 lay between it and the beginning of 
the grey mountains. it was a long and cheerless road, but now that the goblins were 
crushed, it seemed safer to them than the dreadful pathways under the trees. moreover 
beorn was going that way too. 
"farewell! o elvenking!" said gandalf. "merry be the greenwood, while the world is yet 
young! and merry be all your folk!" 
"farewell! o gandalf!" said the king. "may you ever appear where you are most needed 
and least expected! the oftener you appear in my halls the better shall i be pleased!" 

"i beg of you," said bilbo stammering and standing on one foot, "to accept this gift!" and 
he brought out a necklace of silver and pearls that dain had given him at their parting. 
"in what way have i earned such a gift, o hobbit?" said the king. 
"well, er, i thought, don't you know," said bilbo rather confused, "that, er, some little

would be too easy)! farewell!" 
then the elves turned towards the forest, and bilbo started on his long road home. 
he had many hardships and adventures before he got back. the wild was still the wild, 
and there were many other things in it in those days besides goblins; but he was well 
guided and well guarded-the wizard was with him, and beorn for much of the way-and 
he was never in great danger again. anyway by mid-winter gandalf and bilbo had come 
all the way back, along both edges of the forest, to the doors of beorn's house; and 
there for a while they both stayed. yule-tide was warm and merry there; and men came 
from far and wide to feast at beorn's bidding. the goblins of the misty mountains were 
now few and terrified, and hidden in the deepest holes they could find; and the wargs 
had vanished from the woods, so that men went abroad without fear. beorn indeed 
became a great chief afterwards in those regions an

d ruled a wide land between the 
mountains and the wood; and it is said that for many generations the men of his line had 
the power of taking bear's shape, and some were grim men and bad, but most were in 
heart like beorn, if less in size and strength. in their day the last goblins were hunted 
from the misty mountains and a new peace came over the edge of the wild. it was 
spring, and a fair one with mild weathers and a bright sun, before bilbo and gandalf took 
their leave at last of beorn, and though he longed for home. bilbo left with regret, for the 
flowers of the gardens of beorn were m springtime no less marvellous than in high 
summer. at last they came up the long road, and reached the very pass where the 
goblins had captured them before. but they came to that high point at morning, and 
looking backward they saw a white sun shining over the out-stretched lands. 
there behind lay mirkwood, blue in the distance, and darkly green at the n

so late in returning? 
the river is flowing, 
the stars are all burning! 
o! whither so laden, 
so sad and so dreary?

now welcome the weary 
with tra-la-la-lally

then the elves of the valley came out and greeted them and led them across the water 
to the house of elrond. there a warm welcome was made them, and there were many 
eager ears that evening to hear the tale of their adventures. gandalf it was who spoke, 
for bilbo was fallen quiet and drowsy. 
most of the tale he knew, for he had been in it, and had himself told much of it to the 
wizard on their homeward way or in the house of beorn; but every now and again he 
would open one eye, and listen, when a part of the story which he did not yet know came 
in. it was in this way that he learned where gandalf had been to; for he overheard the 
words of the wizard to elrond. it appeared that gandalf had been to a great council of 
the

 white wizards, masters of lore and good magic; and that they had at last driven the 
necromancer from his dark hold in the south of mirkwood. 
"ere long now," gandalf was saying, "the forest will grow somewhat more wholesome. 
the north will be freed from that horror for many long years, i hope. yet i wish he were 
banished from the world!" 

"it would be well indeed," said elrond; "but i fear that will not come about in this age of 
the world, or for many after." 
when the tale of their joumeyings was told, there were other tales, and yet more tales, 
tales of long ago, and tales . of new things, and tales of no time at all, till bilbo's head fell

," said he; "but i will take all the 
cure i can get. a second good night, fair friends!" and with that he went back to bed and 
slept till late morning. 
weariness fell from him soon in that house, and he had many a merry jest and dance, 
early and late, with the elves of the valley. yet even that place could not long delay him 
now, and he thought always of his own home. after a week, therefore, he said farewell to 
elrond, and giving him such small gifts as he would accept, he rode away with gandalf. 
even as they left the valley the sky darkened in the west before them, and wind and rain 
came up to meet them. 
"merry is may-time!" said bilbo, as the rain beat into his face. "but our back is to legends 
and we are coming home. i suppose this is a first taste of it." 
"there is a long road yet," said gandalf. 
"but it is the last road," said bilbo. they came to the river that marked the very edge of 
the borderland of the wild, and to the ford beneath the steep bank, which you may 
remembe

. 
at each point on the road bilbo recalled the happenings and the words of a year ago-it 
seemed to him more like ten-so that, of course, he quickly noted the place where the 
pony had fallen in the river, and they had turned aside for their nasty adventure with tom 
and bert and bill. not far from the road they found the gold of the trolls, which they had 

buried, still hidden and untouched. "i have enough to last me my time," said bilbo, when 
they had dug it up. "you had better take this, gandalf. i daresay you can find a use for 
it." 
"indeed i can!" said the wizard. "but share and share alike! you may find you have more 
needs than you expect." 
so they put the gold in bags and slung them on the ponies, who were not at all pleased 
about it. after that their going was slower, for most of the time they walked. but the land 
was green and there was much grass through which the hobbit strolled along 
contentedly. he mopped his face with a red silk handkerchief-no! not a single one of hi

gandalf looked at him. "my dear bilbo!" he said. "something is the matter with you! you 
are not the hobbit that you were." 
and so they crossed the bridge and passed the mill by the river and came right back to 
bilbo's own door. "bless me! what's going on?" he cried. there was a great commotion, 
and people of all sorts, respectable and unrespectable, were thick round the door, and 
many were going in and out-not even wiping their feet on the mat, as bilbo noticed with 
annoyance.

sant callers came. he took to 
writing poetry and visiting the elves; and though many shook their heads and touched 
their foreheads and said "poor old baggins!" and though few believed any of his tales, 
he remained very happy to the end of his days, and those were extraordinarily long. 
one autumn evening some years afterwards bilbo was sitting in his study writing his 
memoirs - he thought of calling them "there and back again, a hobbit's holiday" - when 
there was a ring at the door. it was gandalf and a dwarf; and the dwarf was actually 
balin. 
"come in! come in!" said bilbo, and soon they were settled in chairs by the fire. if balin 
noticed that mr. baggins' waistcoat was more extensive (and had real gold buttons), 
bilbo also noticed that balm's beard was several inches longer, and his jewelled belt was 
of great magnificence. 
they fell to talking of their times together, of course, and bilbo asked how things were 
going in the lands of the mountain. it seemed they were going very w

 catches such disease he fell under the 
dragon-sickness, and took most of the gold and fled with it, and died of starvation in the 
waste, deserted by his companions. 
"the new master is of wiser kind," said balin, "and very popular, for, of course, he gets 
most of the credit for the present prosperity. they are making 
songs which say that in his day the rivers run with gold." 
"then the prophecies of the old songs have turned out to be true, after a fashion!" said 
bilbo. 
"of course!" said gandalf. "and why should not they prove true? surely you don't 
disbelieve the prophecies, because you had a hand in bringing them about yourself? 
you don't really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes were managed 

by mere luck, just for your sole benefit? you are a very fine person, mr. baggins, and i 
am very fond of you; but you are only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all!" 
"thank goodness!" said bilbo laughing, and handed him the tobacco-jar.
