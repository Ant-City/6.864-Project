r thigh rested the blond head of a little girl, who was stretched out on the plank and sleeping sweetly. now and then the hand of the mother moved across the child's face to chase away the mosquitoes, which had begun to gather as the sun lowered. on the left side of the plank, beyond the girl, sat a boy about seven years old--a well-grown lad, his skin deeply tanned, a certain clever, watchful gleam in his eyes. with hands folded over one knee, he looked straight ahead.

this was the caravan of per hansa, who with his family and all his earthly possessions was moving west from fillmore county, minnesota, to dakota territory. there he intended to take up land and build himself a home; he was going to do something remarkable out there, which should become known far and wide. no lack of opportunity in that country, he had been told! . . . per hansa himself strode ahead and laid out the course; the boy ole, or olamand, followed closely after, and explored it. beret, the wife, drove the oxen and too

"tish-ah, tish-ah!" cried the grass. . . . "tish-ah, tish-ah!" . . .

the caravan seemed a miserably frail and lilliputian thing as it crept over the boundless prairie toward the sky line. of road or trail there lay not a trace ahead; as soon as the grass had straightened up again behind, no one could have told the direction from which it had come or whither it was bound. the whole train--per hansa with his wife and children, the oxen, the wagons, the cow, and all--might just as well have dropped down out of the sky. nor was it at all impossible to imagine that they were trying to get back there again; their course was always the same--straight toward the west, straight toward the sky line. . . .

poverty-stricken, unspeakably forlorn, the caravan creaked along, advancing at a snail's pace, deeper and deeper into a bluish-green infinity--on and on, and always farther on. . . . it steered

for sunset land! . . .

for more than three weeks now, and well into the fourth, this caravan had been crawling across the plain. . . . early in the journey it had passed through blue earth; it had left chain lakes behind; and one fine day it had crept into jackson, on the des moines river. but that seemed ages ago. . . . from jackson, after a short lay-up, it had pushed on westward--always westward--to worthington, then to rock river. . . . a little west of rock river, per hansa had lost the trail completely. since then he had not been able to find it again; at this moment he literally did not know where he was, nor how to get to the place he had to reach. but split rock creek must lie out there somewhere in the sun; if he could only find that landmark, he could pick his way still farther without much trouble. . . . strange that he hadn't reached split rock creek before this time! according to his directions, he should have been there two or three days ago; but he hadn

't seen anything that even looked like the place. . . . oh, my god! if something didn't turn up soon! . . . my god! . . .

the wagons creaked and groaned. per hansa's eyes wandered over the plain. his bearded face swung constantly from side to side as he examined every inch of ground from the northeast to the southwest. at times he gave his whole attention to that part of the plain lying between him and the western sky line; with head bent forward and eyes fixed and searching, he would sniff the air, like an animal trying to find the scent. every now and then he glanced at an old silver watch which he carried in his left hand; but his gaze would quickly wa

nder off again, to take up its fruitless search of the empty horizon.

it was now nearing six o'clock. since three in the afternoon he had been certain of his course; at that time he had taken his bearings by means of his watch and the sun. . . . out here one had to get one's cross-bearings from the very day itself--then trust to luck. . . .

for a long while the little company had been silent. per hansa turned halfway around, and without slackening his pace spoke to the boy walking behind.

"go back and drive for a while now, ola.1 . . . you must talk to mother, too, so that it won't be so lonesome for her. and be sure to keep as sharp a lookout as you can."

 

1 in most dialects of norway the name ole becomes ola when spoken.

 

"i'm not tired yet!" said the boy, loath to leave the van.

"go back, anyway! maybe you're not, but i can feel it beginning to tell on me. we'll have to start cooki

ng the porridge pretty soon. . . . you go back, and hold her on the sun for a while longer."

"do you think we'll catch up with them to-night, dad?" the boy was still undecided.

"good lord, no! they've got too long a start on us. . . . look sharp, now! if you happen to see anything suspicious, sing out!" . . . per hansa glanced again at his watch, turned forward, and strode steadily onward.

ole said no more; he stepped out of the track and stood there waiting till the train came up. then store-hans jumped down nimbly, while the other climbed up and took his seat.

"have you seen anything?" the mother asked in an anxious voice.

"why, no . . . not yet," answered the boy, evasively.

"i wonder if we shall ever see them again," she said, as if speaking to herself, and looked down at the ground. "this seems to be

nd that vague sense of the unknown which bore in on them so strongly from all directions. . . . ole sat there and drove like a full-grown man; by some means or other he managed to get more speed out of the oxen than the mother had done--she noticed this herself. his eyes were searching the prairie far and near.

out on the sky line the huge plain now began to swell and rise, almost as if an abscess were forming under the skin of the earth. although this elevation lay somewhat out of his course, per hansa swung over and held straight toward the highest part of it.

the afternoon breeze lulled, and finally dropped off altogether. the sun, whose golden lustre had faded imperceptibly into a reddish hue, shone now with a dull light, yet strong and clear; in a short while, deeper tones of violet began to creep across the red. the great ball grew enormous; it retreated farther and farther into the empty reaches of the western sky; then it sank suddenly. . . . the spell of evening quickly crowded in an

ome of the emotions that overwhelmed him, but only choked when he tried.

"did you ever see anything so beautiful!" he whispered at last, and gave a heavy sigh. . . . low down in the northwest, above the little hill, a few fleecy clouds hovered, betokening fair weather; now they were fringed with shining gold, which glowed with a mellow light. as if they had no weight, they floated lightly there. . . .

the mother drew herself forward to an upright position. she still held the child in her lap. per hansa and store-hans were walking in the dusk far up ahead. for the last two days per had kept well in advance of the caravan all the time; she thought she knew the reason why.

"per," she called out, wearily, "aren't we going to stop soon?"

"pretty soon." . . . he did not slacken his pace.

she shifted the child over into the other arm and began to weep silently. ole saw it, but pretended not to notice, though he had to swallow big lumps that were forcing themselves up in his throat; he kept his ey

fe! but we're keeping the right course, anyhow."

"have the others been this way?"

"of course they have--somewhere near, at any rate. there's supposed to be a creek around here, by the name of split rock creek, or whatever they call it in english."

"are there any people here, do you think?"

"people? good lord, no! there isn't a soul around these parts."

the sombre blue haze was now closing rapidly in on the caravan. one sensed the night near at hand; it breathed a chill as it came.

at last per hansa halted. "well, i suppose we can't drive any farther to-day. we and the animals would both drop pretty soon." with these words he faced the oxen, held his arms straight out like the horizontal beam of a cross, shouted a long-drawn "whoa!"--and then the creaking stopped for that day.

 

iii

 

the preparations for the night were soon made; each had his own task and was now well used to it. store-hans brought the wood; it lay strapped under the hind wagon and consisted of small logs and dry bran

le and store-hans flared up in a quarrel; one blamed the other for eating too close to the edge, where the porridge was coolest. the father paused in his meal, listening to them a moment, then chuckled to himself. taking his spoon and cutting three lines through the crust of the porridge, he quickly settled the matter between them.

"there you are! here, store-hans, is your land; now take it and be satisfied. ola, who is the biggest, gets another forty. . . . shut up your mouths, now, and eat!" per hansa himself got the smallest share that evening.

aside from this outbreak it was quiet at the table. a spell of silence lay upon them and they were not able to throw it off. . . . as soon as the father had eaten he licked his spoon carefully, wiped it off on his shirt sleeve, and threw it on the blanket. the boys did likewise as they finished; but and-ongen wanted to tuck her spoon in her dress and keep it there till morning.

they sat around in the same silence after they were done. then she who

was the smallest of them repeated in a tiny voice:

"thanks to thee, our lord and maker. . . .

"now i want to go to sleep in your lap!" she said, after the amen. she climbed up into her mother's lap and threw her arms around her neck.

"oh, how quickly it grows dark out here!" the mother murmured.

per hansa gave a care-free shrug of his shoulders. "well," he said, dryly, "the sooner the day's over, the sooner the next day comes!"

but now something seemed to be brewing back there over the prairie whence they had come. up from the horizon swelled a supernatural light--a glow of pale yellow and transparent green, mingled with strange touches of red and gold. it spread upward as they watched; the colors deepened; the glow grew stronger, like the witching light of a fen fire.

all sat silently gazing.

the plain. the silvery beams grew stronger; the first pale fen fire began to shimmer and spread; slowly the light mellowed into a mist of green and yellow and blue. and-ongen exclaimed that the moon was much bigger to-night; but it had seemed bigger the night before also. store-hans again solemnly told her the reason for it--that the moon had to grow, just as she did! this seemed to her quite logical; she turned to her mother and asked whether the moon had milk and porridge every evening, too.

per hansa had been sitting on the tongue of the wagon, smoking his pipe. now he got up, knocked out the ashes carefully, put his pipe in his pocket, and wound up his watch. these duties done, he gave the order to turn in for the night.

a little while later they all lay under the quilts, gazing off into the opalescent glow. when the mother thought that the children had gone to sleep she asked, soberly:

"do you suppose we'll ever find the others again?"

"oh yes--i'm sure of it . . . if they haven't sunk

 through the ground!"

this was all per hansa said. he yawned once or twice, long and heavily, as if he were very sleepy, and turned away from her.

. . . and after that she said no more, either.

 

iv

 

truth to tell, per hansa was not a bit sleepy. for a long while he lay wide awake, staring into the night. although the evening had grown cool, sweat started out on his body from time to time, as thoughts which he could not banish persisted in his mind.

he had good reason to sweat, at all the things he was forced to lie there and remember. nor was it only tonight that these heavy thoughts came to trouble him; it had been just the same all through the day, and last night, too, and the night before. and now, the moment

e recalled keenly all the scruples and misgivings that had obsessed his wife before they had started out on this long journey--both those which had been spoken and those which had been left unsaid. the latter had been the worst; they had seemed to grow deeper and more tragic as he had kept prying into them in his clumsy way. . . . but she wasn't a bit stupid, that wife of his! as a matter of fact, she had more sense than most people. indeed she had!

. . . no, it wasn't a pleasant situation for per hansa, by any means. he had not seen a happy moment, day or night, since the mishap had struck them on the second afternoon this side of jackson. there the first wagon had got stuck in a mud hole; in pulling it out they had wrecked it so hopelessly that he had been forced to put back to jackson for repairs. under the circumstances, it had seemed to him utterly senseless to hold up all the rest of the company four days. he simply wouldn't listen to their waiting for him; for they had houses to build a

 across the traces of their camps. it was getting to be a matter of life and death to him to find the trail--and find it soon. . . . a devil of a jaunt it would be to the pacific ocean--the wagon would never hold out that long! . . . oh yes, he realized it all too well--a matter of life and death. there weren't many supplies left in the wagon. he had depended on his old comrade and lofot-man,1 hans olsa, for everything.

 

1 a companion on the winter fishing grounds at the lofoten islands.

 

per hansa heaved a deep sigh; it came out before he could stop it. . . . huh!--it was an easy matter enough for hans olsa! he had ample means, and could start out on a big scale from the beginning; he had a wife in whose heart there wasn't a speck of fear! . . . the lord only knew where they were now--whether they were east or west of him! and they had tönseten, too, and his wife kjersti,2 both of them used to america. why, they could talk the language and everything. . . .

 been what she had wanted, though she had never said it in so many words.

the quilt had grown oppressively heavy; he threw it aside. . . . how long it took her to go to sleep to-night! why wouldn't she try to get as much rest as possible? surely she knew that it would be another tough day tomorrow? . . .

. . . just so that confounded wagon didn't go to pieces again! . . .

 

v

 

the night wore on. the children slept quietly and peacefully. the mother also seemed to have found rest at last. per hansa thought that she was sound asleep; he began to move slowly away from her. he threw his hand over on the quilt between them as if making a motion in his sleep. . . . no, she didn't stir; he lay quiet for a while, then moved again. in so doing his hand happened to fall on that of store-hans; it was so chubby and round, that hand, so healthy and warm, and quite firm for the hand of only a child. per hansa lay still for a long time, holding the boy's hand with a desperate earnestness. . . . slowly

ift; his courage ebbed back again; surely everything would come out all right in the end!

little by little he slipped the quilt off, crept out of bed as quietly as a mouse, got into his trousers, and pulled on his shoes.

outside, the misty sheen of the moonlight shimmered so brightly that it blinded him. near at hand, the prairie was bathed in a flood of tarnished green; farther off the faint blue tones began to appear, merging gradually into the purple dimness that shrouded all the horizon.

per hansa looked for the north star, found it, turned about until he had it over his right shoulder; then he glanced at his watch, took a few steps, hesitated, and looked back as if taking a bearing of the wagons and the star. the next moment he faced about resolutely, and hurried off westward.

it felt good to be moving again; he almost broke into a trot. there were the oxen, busily grazing; they needed to get their fill all right, poor devils! . . . rosie lay closer to the wagons; his eyes had passed o

ver her at first, a dark spot in the vague, deceptive light. the cow must have noticed the shadow gliding along so swiftly; she gave a long moo. . . . this enraged per hansa; he broke into a run and got out of her sight as quickly as he could, for fear she would moo again. . . . if she only hadn't waked beret!

he set his course toward the point where he thought the crest of the ridge must lie. now and then he stopped and looked around, to find out if he could still see the wagons. when he had lost them at last, and they were wholly swallowed up in the night, he gave an involuntary gasp--but clenched his teeth and went on.

the ridge lay farther off than he had tho

hed what he felt to be the highest point; he reckoned that he must be at least four miles from camp. . . . there he fell to examining the ground carefully; but first of all he looked at his watch again, and then at the north star and the moon, trying to fix the bearings of the camp in his mind.

on the other side of the ridge the lay of the land seemed to be different; the slope was a little steeper; a thick underbrush covered it; through the tall bushes the moonlight shimmered strangely. . . . per hansa felt no fear, but every sense within him was alert. first he searched the northerly slope of the hill, beyond the edge of the thicket, stooping over as he went, his eyes scanning every foot of the ground. when he had found no trace of what he was looking for, he came back to the same starting point and searched an equal distance in the opposite direction; but he discovered nothing on this tack, either.

now he began to walk along the edge of the thicket, in and out, crisscrossing the line in ev

ery direction; he pushed his way into each little grassless opening, and kicked over the earth there, before he went on. sweat was running off him in streams. a quarter of an hour went by; he was still searching frantically. . . . all at once, right at the edge of the woods, he struck a piece of level ground with a larger clearing on it; in the middle of this clearing lay a wide, round patch in the grass. per hansa threw himself down on his knees, like a miser who has found a costly treasure; he bent over and sniffed the ground. his blood throbbed; his hands shook as he dug. . . . yes, he was right--here there had been a fire! it couldn't have been many days ago, either; the smell of the ashes was still fresh. . . . his eyes had grown so moist and dim that he had to wipe them. . . . but he wasn't crying--no, not yet! . . .

he began to crawl around on all fours, farther and farther down the slope. suddenl

. . . . had they chosen the best crossing, after all? the bank of the creek on the other side formed a bend; the brink looked pretty steep. at last he waded out into the water, with his shoes still on. . . . oh, well, the grade wasn't so steep that the oxen couldn't easily make it; there would be a bad jolt here at the edge, but after that they would have an even slope up the bank. . . . stepping out on the opposite shore, he stood as if rooted to the ground.

. . . "what in the devil . . . !"

per hansa bent over and picked up the object that lay before him; he held it out in the moonlight, turned it over and over in his hands, smelled of it . . . then took a bite.

. . . "by god! if it isn't one of hans olsa's dried mutton legs!"

he straightened himself up and gazed with deep thankfulness into the quivering bluish-green haze that glowed all around him. . . . "yes, that's the way it goes, when people have more than they can take care of!" . . . he stuck the mutton leg under his arm; whistling

suddenly she could stand it no longer. she ran over to him, flung her arms around his neck, and leaned close against him. the dam of her pent-up tears broke in a flood of emotion; she wept long and bitterly.

"now calm yourself, dear. . . . you must calm yourself, beret-girl!" . . . he had put his arm lovingly around her, but found it hard to speak. . . . "don't you see that i've got one of hans olsa's dried mutton legs under my arm?" . . .

. . . that night per hansa was good to his wife.

on the side of a hill, which sloped gently away toward the southeast and followed with many windings a creek that wormed its way across the prairie, stood hans olsa, laying turf. he was building a sod house. the walls had now risen breast-high; in its half-finished condition, the structure resembled more a bulwark against some enemy than anything intended to be a human habitation. and the great heaps of cut sod, piled up in each corner mi

 glance; he didn't tell her in words to stop her foolish chatter--but she said no more. without speaking once, he ate his dinner. as soon as he had finished, he tossed his spoon on the blanket, thanked them for the food, got up gloomily, and went back to the half-completed wall. there he sat down awhile, as if lost in thought . . . gazing eastward. his large, rugged features were drawn and furrowed with anxiety. . . . "god almighty!" he sighed, and folded his big hands. "what can have become of per hansa?"

his wife was watching him closely as he sat there on the wall. by and by she told her daughter to finish washing the dishes, and started to go over where he was. when he saw her coming, he tried to begin working as if there were nothing on his mind.

"hans," she said, quickly, when she had reached his side, "i think you ought to go out and look for them!"

he waited until he had got a strip of sod in place before he answered: "easier said than done . . . when we haven't the faintest idea whe

re to look . . . on such stretches of prairie!"

"yes, i know; but it would make us all feel better, anyway . . . as if we were doing something."

hans olsa laid another strip of turf; then he stopped, let his hands fall to his sides, and began thinking aloud as he gazed off into the distance. . . .

"i know this much--you don't often find a smarter fellow than per hansa. . . . that's what makes it so queer! i don't suppose he's able to get much speed out of his oxen; but one thing i'm certain of--he has been hurrying as fast as he could. and we surely didn't come along very fast . . . but now it's the fifth day since we arrived here! if he made use of these bright moonlight nights, as he probably did, i begin to be afraid that he's gone on west of us somewhere, instead of being still to the eastward. . . . it's certainly no child's play to start looking for hi

 you must remember, though, that he couldn't go very fast on account of her condition. . . . i think she is with child again!" she paused. "i dreamed about them last night . . . a bad dream. . . ."

her husband glanced sidewise at her. "we mustn't pay attention to such things. a bad dream is a good sign, anyway--that's what my mother always said. . . . but i suppose i'll never forgive myself for not waiting for him." he got up heavily and laid another strip of turf. "he's always been like that, per hansa; he never would take help from any man. but this time he's carried it a little too far!"

his wife made no answer. she was watching a short stout man with a reddish beard who had started up the slope from the direction of the house to the south of them. he had cheeks like two rosy apples, a quick step, and eyes that flitted all about; he was noted among them for his glib tongue and the flood of his conversation. with hands stuck into the waistband of his trousers, and elbows out akimbo, the man

 on him. "you haven't caught sight of them yourself, syvert, have you?"

"caught sight of them? why, man alive, that's just what i've come up here to tell you! i've had them in sight for over an hour now. seems to me you ought to be able to see them easy enough--you who carry your eyes so high up in the air! . . . good lord! it won't be long before they arrive here, at the rate they're coming!"

"what's that you say?" the others burst out with one voice. . . . "where are they?" . . .

"i reckon per hansa must have got off his course a little. maybe the oxen didn't steer well, or maybe he didn't figure the current right. . . . look to the westward, neighbours! look over there about west-northwest, and you'll see him plain enough. . . . no need to worry. that fellow never would drown in such shallow water as this! . . . i wonder, now, how far west he's really been?"

hans olsa and his wife faced around in the direction that tönseten had indicated. sure enough, out of the west a little caravan wa

 it really you, old boy? . . . but why are you coming from the west, i'd like to know?"

tönseten coughed, and gave the woman a sly wink.

"look here, mother sörrina," he said with a twinkle in his eyes, "won't you be good enough, please, to take a peek at hans olsa's sunday bottle? . . . not that i want anything to drink, you understand--i should say not. good lord, no! but think of that poor woman out there, who has been suffering all this time without a drop! and i'd be willing to bet that per hansa wouldn't object to having his stomach warmed up a little, too!"

at that they burst out laughing, from mingled joy and relief; but tönseten's laughter at his own joke was the loudest of all. . . . work was resumed at once; syvert began to carry the sods for hans olsa to lay up, while mother sörrina went off in a happy frame of mind, to make her preparations for the reception of the wanderers.

y longer, and ran down to meet the new arrivals. she took store-hans by the hand and fell in beside him; the first question she asked was whether he hadn't been terribly scared at night? . . .

as the slope of the hill grew steeper, the oxen had to bend to the yoke.

"hey, there, folks!" shouted per hansa, boisterously. "don't be standing around loafing, now! it's only the middle of the afternoon. haven't you got anything to do around here?"

"coffee time, coffee time, per hansa . . . ha, ha, ha!" tönseten was bubbling over with good spirits. "we thought we might as well wait a little while for you, you know."

. . . "you've found us at last!" said hans olsa, with a deep, happy chuckle. . . . he didn't seem able to let go of per hansa's hand.

"found you? why, devil take it, it's no trick to follow a course out here! you just have to keep on steering straight ahead. and you had marked the trail pretty well, all the way along. i found plenty of traces of you. . . . i g

"hadn't we better unhitch the oxen, dad?"

"yes, yes--that's right, ola. we might as well camp down here for the night, since we've run across some folks we used to know. . . . how about it, you fellows?" he turned to the other two. "i suppose there's a little more land left around here, isn't there, after you've got through?"

"land? good god! per hansa, what are you talking about? take whatever you please, from here to the pacific ocean!" tönseten's enthusiasm got so far away with him that he had to pull one of his hands out of his waistband and make a sweeping circle with it in the air. "you must take a look around as soon as you can," hans olsa said, "and see if you find anything better that meets your fancy. in the meanwhile i've put down a stake for you on the quarter section that lies north of mine. we'll go over and have a look at it p

per hansa drew a deep breath, as if filling himself with life's great goodness. . . . here hans olsa had been worrying about him, and with kindly forethought had arranged everything to his advantage! . . . "well, well, we'll have to settle all that later, hans olsa. for the present, i can only say that i'm deeply thankful to you! . . . unhitch the beasts, there, ola! . . . and now, if you folks have got anything handy, to either eat or drink, i'll accept it with pleasure."

l gathered around a white cloth which mother sörine had spread on the ground. on one side of it lay a whole leg of dried mutton; on the other a large heap of flatbröd, with cheese, bread, and butter; in the centre of the cloth stood a large bowl of sweet milk, and from the direction of the stove the breeze wafted to them a pleasant odour of fried bacon and strong coffee. mother sörine herself took charge of the ceremony, bringing the food and urging them all to sit down. the stocky figure of per hansa rocked back and forth in blissful delight as he squatted there with his legs crossed under him.

"come, sörrina, sit down!" he cried. "i guess we've fallen in with gentlefolks, by the looks of things around here. . . . i suppose you think you're old pharaoh himself--eh, hans olsa?"

"who do you call me, then?" inquired tönseten.

"you, syvert? well, now, i really don't know what to say. of course you'd like to be his majesty's butler, but you mustn't be encouraged--remember what happened to t

t must be, to have a wife like that!"

"stop your foolishness!" said kjersti, but her voice didn't sound too severe.

for a long while they continued to sit around the cloth, chatting, eating, and drinking, and thoroughly enjoying themselves. hans olsa seemed like a different man from the one who had eaten here at noon. his loud voice led the cheerful talk; his ponderous bulk was always the centre of the merriment; it seemed as if he would never tire of gazing into that bearded, roguish face of per hansa's.

once, as per hansa was slicing off a piece of mutton, he regarded the cut thoughtfully, and asked:

"i suppose you brought all your supplies through safe enough?"

"oh, sure," answered hans olsa, innocently. "we had no trouble at all--didn't lose anything; that is, except for the leg that we left behind somewhere, east on the prairie. but that's hardly worth mentioning."

per hansa paused with the piece of meat halfway to his mouth, and looked at sörine with an expression of deep concern:

 
 ___________________________
 

"the devil you say! did you lose one of your legs . . . ?"

mother sörine laughed heartily at him. "oh no--not quite so bad as that. . . . but a leg of mutton might come in handy later on, i'll tell you; there aren't too many of them to be had around here."

per hansa chewed away on the meat and looked very serious. at last he said:

"that's always the way with folks who have more of the world's goods than they can take care. . . . but i'll promise you one thing, sörrina: if i can get my old blunderbuss to work, you're going to have your lost leg back again. . . . how about it, fellows? have you seen any game that's fit to eat out here?"

they sat on until the first blue haze of evening began to spread eastward over the plain. the talk had now dr

they were so far from the world . . . cut off from the haunts of their fellow beings . . . so terribly far! . . .

the faces that gazed into one another were sober now, as silence claimed the little company; but lines of strength and determination on nearly every countenance told of an inward resolve to keep the mood of depression from gaining full control.

per hansa was the first to rouse himself and throw off the spell. he jumped up with nervous energy; a shiver passed over him, as if he were having a chill.

"what is it--are you cold?" asked his wife. she had instinctively sensed his mood as she looked at him--and loved him better for it. until that moment, she had supposed that she herself was the only one who felt this peculiar influence.

"such crazy talk!" he burst out. "i believe we've all lost our senses, every last one of us! here we sit around ce

everyone got up.

"you must do exactly as you please about it, per hansa," spoke up hans olsa with an apologetic air. "don't feel that you must take this quarter if you don't like it. but as far as i can see, it's as good a piece of land as you could find anywhere around--every square foot of it plowland, except the hill over there. plenty of water for both man and beast. . . . as for my part, if i can only sit here between you and syvert, i certainly won't be kicking about my neighbours. . . . but i don't want you to feel that you have to take this quarter on my ac

 my best advice, anyway."

"now, that's the talk!" tönseten chimed in, briskly. "and considering the size of the head it comes from, it isn't half bad, either. you're damned well right, hans olsa. before the snow flies you're going to see such a multitude swarming around these parts, that the thundering place won't be fit to live in! remember what i say, boys, in times to come--bear it in mind that those were syvert's very words! . . . you've got to go straight to sioux falls tomorrow morning, per hansa, and no two ways about it! if one of the solum boys can't go along to do the talking for you, why, i shall have to buckle down to the job myself."

once more per hansa's heart filled with a deep sense of peace and contentment as he realized how matters were being smoothed out for him. they seemed to move of their own accord but he knew better. . . . was he really to own it? was it really to become his possession, this big stretch of fine land that spread here before him? was he really to have h

devil, no!" tönseten assured him. "neither israelites nor canaanites! i was the first one to find this place, you know. . . . but there's no telling how soon the drift will loosen, the way folks were talking back east last winter. and now the land office for this whole section of country has been moved to sioux falls, too. that means business; the government, you may be certain, has good reason for doing such a thing." tönseten spoke with all the importance of a man who has inside knowledge.

per hansa looked at him, and a bantering tone came into his voice:

"i see it clearly, syvert--it would never do to keep you around here as a mere baker! we'll have to promote you to a higher office, right away. . . . now, boys, i'm going over to see this empire that you two have set aside for me. ola, you hitch up the oxen again and bring the wagons along."

with these commands he walked rapidly away; the others had almost to run in order to keep up with him. strong emotions surged through him as he str

ode on. . . .

"it lies high," he observed after a while, when they had looked all the plowland over. . . . "there must be a fine view from the top of that hill."

they were bending their steps in this direction, and soon had reached the highest point. it seemed so spacious and beautiful to stand high above the prairie and look around, especially now, when the shades of evening were falling. . . . suddenly per hansa began to step more cautiously; he sniffed the air like an animal; in a moment he stopped beside a small depression in the ground, and stood gazing at it intently for quite a while; then he said, quietly:

"there are people buried here. . . . that is a grave!"

"oh no, per hansa! it can't be possible."

"no doubt about it," he said in the same subdued but positive tone.

tönseten and hans olsa were so astonished that they could hardly credit the fact; they came over at once to where per hansa s

 down into the hollow. hans olsa bent over and picked up a small stone that his eyes had lighted on; he turned it around in his hand several times. . . . "that's a queer-looking piece of stone! i almost believe people have shaped it for some use. . . . here, see what you make of it, syvert."

tönseten's ruddy face grew sober and thoughtful as he examined the object.

"by thunder! it certainly looks as if the indians had been here! . . . now isn't that rotten luck?" . . .

"i'm afraid so," said per hansa, with a vigorous nod. then he added, sharply, "but we needn't shout the fact from the house-tops, you know! . . . it takes so very little to scare some folks around here."

he waited no longer but walked hastily down the hill; at the foot he called to ole, telling him not to drive any farther; but first he turned to hans olsa to find out whether they were well across the line between the two quarters.

"no use in building farther away from you than is absolutely necessary," he said. "it's going

 to be lonesome for the women-folks at times." . . .

. . . awhile later, tönseten was dragging his way homeward. for reasons that he wouldn't admit even to himself, he walked a good deal heavier now than when he had climbed the slope that afternoon.

per hansa returned with his other neighbour to the wagons, where beret and the children were waiting. again he inquired about the line between the two quarters; then asked beret and hans olsa to help pick the best building place; his words, though few and soberly spoken, had in them an unmistakable ring of determination. . . . this vast stretch of beautiful land was to be his--yes, his--and no ghost of a dead indian would drive him away! . . . his heart began to expand with a mighty exaltation. an emotio

early the next morning per hansa and one of the solum boys set out on the fifty-two-mile journey to sioux falls, where per hansa filed an application for the quarter-section of land which lay to the north of hans olsa's. to confirm the application, he received a temporary deed to the land. the deed was made out in the name of peder benjamin hansen; it contained a description of the land, the conditions which he agreed to fulfil in order to become the owner, and the date, june 6, 1873.

sörine wanted beret and the children to stay with her during the two days that her husband would be away; but she refused the offer with

the children were playing boisterously a little way off. what a terrible noise they made! but she had better let them keep on with their play, as long as they were happy. . . . she sat perfectly quiet, thinking of the long, oh, so interminably long march that they would have to make, back to the place where human beings dwelt. it would be small hardship for her, of course, sitting in the wagon; but she pitied per hansa and the boys--and then the poor oxen! . . . he certainly would soon find out for himself that a home for men and women and children could never be established in this wilderness. . . . and how could she bring new life into the world out here! . . .

slowly her thoughts began to centre on her husband; they grew warm and tender as they dwelt on him. she trembled as they came. . . .

but only for a brief while. as her eyes darted nervously here and there, flitting from object to object and trying

. . . beret could not go to sleep for a long time that night. at last she grew thoroughly angry with herself; her nerves were taut as bowstrings; her head kept rising up from the pillow to listen--but there was nothing to hear . . . nothing except the night wind, which now had begun to stir.

. . . it stirred with so many unknown things! . . .

per hansa came home late the following afternoon; he had so many words of praise for what she and the boys had accomplished while he had been gone, that he fairly bewildered her. now it had taken possession of him again--that indomitable, conquering mood which seemed to give him the right of way wherever he went, whatever he did. outwardly, at such times, he showed only a buoyant recklessness, as if wrapped in a cloak of gay, wanton levity; but down beneath all this lay a stern determination of purpose,

w it all yet. . . . what do you say, my beret-girl?"

beret stood smiling at him, with tears in her eyes, beside the improvised house that she had made; there was little for her to say. and what would be the use of speaking now? he was so completely wrapped up in his own plans that he would not listen nor understand. it would be wrong, too, to trouble him with her fears and misgivings. . . . when he felt like this he was so tender to her, so cheerful, so loving and kind. . . . how well she knew per hansa! . . .

"what are you thinking about it all, my beret-girl?" he flung his arm around her, whirled her off her feet, and drew her toward him.

"oh, per, it's only this--i'm so afraid out here!" she snuggled up against him, as if trying to hide herself. "it's all so big and open . . . so empty. . . . oh, per! not another human being from here to the end of the world!"

per hansa laughed loud and long, so that she winced under the force and meaning of it. "there'll soon be more people, girl . . .

hing in that sad resignation of hers which he was powerless against. as he walked beside her and held her hand, he felt as if he could laugh and cry in the same breath. . . . she was so dear, so dear to him. why could he never make her understand it fully? it was a strange, baffling thing! but perhaps the reason for it lay in this: she was not built to wrestle with fortune--she was too fine-grained. . . . oh, well--he knew one person, at any rate, who stood ready to do the fighting for her!

 

per hansa had so much to think about that night that a long time passed before he could get to sleep. now was a good chance to make his plans, while beret lay at his side, sleeping safe and sound; he must utilize every moment now; he didn't feel very tired, either.

there seemed to be no end to the things he needed. but thirty dollars was all the money he had in the world; and when he thought of what would have to be bought in the near future, and of everything that waited to be done, the list grew as lo

ominated all the visions which now seemed to come to him of their own accord. . . . the whole farm lay there before him, broken and under cultivation, yielding its fruitful harvests; there ran many horses and cows, both young and grown. and over on the location where to-day he was about to build the sod hut should stand a large dwelling . . . a white house, it would be! then it would gleam so beautifully in the sun, white all over--but the cornices should be bright green! . . .

when, long ago, per hansa had had his first vision of the house, it had been painted white, with green cornices; and these colours had belonged to it in his mind ever since. but the stable, the barn, and all the rest of the outhouses should be painted red, with white cornices--for that gave such a fine effect! . . . oh yes, that beret-girl of his should certainly have a royal mansion for herself and her little princess! . . .

it would have gone much easier now if ole had only been there to drive the oxen, so that he could have given his whole attention to the plow. but never mind that! . . . the boy ought to sleep for at least another hour; the day would be plenty long enough for him, before it was through. . . . young bulls have tender sinews--though for one of his age, ole was an exceptionally able youngster.

that first furrow turned out very crooked for per hansa; he made a long one of it, too. when he thought he had gone far enough and halted the oxen, the furrow came winding up behind him like a snake. he turned around, drove the oxen back in the opposite direction, and laid another furrow up against the one he had already struck. . . . at the starting point again, he surveyed his work ruefully. well, the second furrow wasn't any crookeder than the first, at all events! . . . when he had made another round he let the oxen stand awhile; taking the spad

by breakfast time he had made a fine start. no sooner had he swallowed the last morsel than he ordered both the boys to turn to, hitched the oxen to the old homemade wagon, and off they all went together toward the field, per hansa leading the way. . . . "you'd better cook the kettles full to-day!" he shouted back, as they were leaving. "we're going to punish a lot of food when we come in!"

"this is the way to do it!" he said, seizing the hoe. "watch me, now--like this!" he hewed away till the clods were flying around him. . . . when they quit work at noon a good many furrows lay stretched out on the slope, smiling up at the sun; they were also able to bring home with them a full wagonload of building material; at coffee time they brought another; at supper anothe

he began building the house that same evening.

"you ought to rest, per hansa!" beret pleaded. "please use a little common sense!"

"rest--of course! that's just what i propose to do! . . . come along, now, all hands of you; you can't imagine what fun this is going to be. . . . just think of it--a new house on our own estate! i don't mean that you've got to work, you know; but come along and watch the royal mansion rise!"

they all joined in, nevertheless . . . couldn't have kept their hands off. it gave them such keen enjoyment that they worked away until they could no

longer see to place the strips of sod. then per hansa called a halt--that was enough for one day. they had laboured hard and faithfully; well, they would get their wages in due time, every last one of them--but he couldn't bother with such trifles just now!

. . . that night sleep overpowered him at once; he was too tired even to dream.

from now on per hansa worked on the house every morning before breakfast, and every evening as soon as he had finished supper. the whole family joined in the task when they had nothing else to do; it seemed like a fascinating game.

to the eyes of tönseten and hans olsa, it appeared as if nothing short of witchcraft must be at work on per hansa's quarter section; in spite of the fact that he and his entire family were breaking ground in the fields the whole day long, a great sod house shot up beside the wagon, like

 an enormous mushroom.

per hansa plowed and harrowed, delved and dug; he built away at the house, and he planted the potatoes; he had such a zest for everything and thought it all such fun that he could hardly bear to waste a moment in stupid sleep. it was beret who finally put a check on him. one morning, as he threw off the blanket at dawn, on the point of jumping up in his reckless way, she lay there awake, waiting for him. the moment he stirred, she put her arms lovingly around him and told him that he must stay in bed awh

st to look after him!

. . . he thought of other things that she had done. when they had harrowed and hoed sufficient seed ground, beret had looked over her bundles and produced all kinds of seeds--he couldn't imagine how or where she had got them--turnips, and carrots, and onions, and tomatoes, and melons, even! . . . what a wife she was! . . . well, he had better stay in bed and please her this time, when she had been so clever and thoughtful about everything.

however it was accomplished, on per hansa's estate they had a field all broken and harrowed and seeded down, and a large house ready for thatching, by the time that hans olsa and the solum boys had barely finished thatching their houses and started the plowing. tönseten, though, was ahead of him with the breaking--per hansa had to accept that--and was now busy planting his potatoes. but syvert had every reason to be in the lead; his house had been all ready to move into when they had arrived. that little stable which he had built wasn

't more than a decent day's work for an able man. and he had horses, too. . . . of course, such things gave him a big advantage!

they finished planting the big field at per hansa's late one afternoon; all the potatoes that he had brought home from sioux falls had been cut in small pieces and tucked away in the ground. . . . "only one eye to each piece!" he had warned beret as she sat beside him, cutting them up. "that's enough for such rich soil." . . . the other seed, which she had provided with such splendid forethought, had also been planted. the field looked larger than it really was. it stood out clearly against the fresh verdure of the hillside; from a little dist

ance it appeared as if some one had sewn a dark brown patch on a huge green cloth. . . . that patch looked mighty good to per hansa as he stood surveying the scene, his whole being filled with the sense of completed effort. here he had barely arrived in a new country; yet already he had got more seed into the ground than on any previous year since beret and he had started out for themselves. . . . just wait! what couldn't he do another year!

"well, beret-girl," he said, "we've cleaned up a busy spring season, all right! to-night we ought to have an extra-fine dish of porridge, to bless what has been put into the ground." h

red out half of the milk that rosie had given that morning, dipped some grits from the bag and prepared the porridge, adding water until it was thin enough. before she served it up she put a small dab of butter in each dish, like a tiny eye that would hardly keep open; then she sprinkled over the porridge a small portion of sugar; this was all the luxury she could afford. indeed, her heart began to reproach her even for this extravagance. but when she saw the joyful faces of the boys, and heard per hansa's exclamations over her merits as a housekeeper, she brightened up a little, cast her fears to the wind, and sprinkled on more sugar from the bag. . . . then she sat down among them, smiling and happy; she was glad that she hadn't told them how her back was aching. . . .

. . . they all worked at the house building that night as long as they could see.

me he exclaimed:

"will you please inform me, per hansa, what the devil you think you're building? is it just a house, or is it a church and parsonage rolled in one? . . . have you lost your senses altogether, man? you won't be able to get a roof over this crazy thing in a month of sundays! . . . why, damn it all, there aren't willows enough in this whole region to thatch a half of it! you might just as well tear it down again, for all the good it will do."

"the hell you say!" cried per hansa, genially. "but there it stands, as big as billy-be-damned, so what are you going to do about it? . . . the notion i had was this: i might as well build for my sons, too, while i was about it. then when they got married and needed more room they could thatch a new section any time. . . . what ails you, syvert? isn't there plenty of sod for roofing, all the way from here to the pacific coast?"

but tönseten took a serious view of the affair:

"i tell you, per hansa, there's no sense in such a p

erformance. it isn't the sod, it's the poles--you know it damned well! . . . you'd better go right ahead and tear it down as fast as ever you can!"

"oh, well, i suppose i'll have to, then," said per hansa, dryly.

as a matter of fact, it was hardly to be wondered at that tönseten grew excited when he saw this structure; it differed radically from the one he had built and from all the others that he had ever seen. he wondered if such a silly house as this could be found anywhere else in the whole country. . . . his own hut measured fourteen by sixteen feet; the one that the solum boys were building was only fourteen feet each way; hans olsa had been reckless and had laid his out eighteen feet lo

ng and sixteen feet wide. . . . but look at this house of per hansa's--twenty-eight feet long and eighteen feet wide! moreover, it had two rooms, one of them eighteen by eighteen, the other eighteen by ten. the rooms were separated by a wall; one had a door opening toward the south, the other a door opening toward the east. two doors in a sod hut! my god! what folly! in the smaller room the sod even had been taken up, so that the floor level there was a foot below that of the larger room. what was the sense of that? . . . if we don't look out, thought tönseten
 
 ___________________________
 
, this crazy man will start building a tower on it, too!

things surely looked serious to tönseten. in the first place, per hansa plainly was getting big-headed; heavens and earth, it was nothing but an ordinary sod hut that he was building! in the second place, it wasn't a practical scheme. if he were to search till doomsday, he wouldn't be able to find enough willows for the thatching. why, he might just as well thatch the whole firmament, and be done with it! . . . as soon as he had looked his fill, tönseten trotted right over to hans olsa's, told him all about it, and asked him to go and reason with the man. . . . bu

"but that's just it--he doesn't know what he's bitten off! he doesn't know anything at all about building a house!" with these drastic words, tönseten went directly to the solum boys; they had been born and brought up in america, and knew what was what. now they must go, right away, and talk to per hansa about th

is crazy building that he was putting up! the only way out of it that he could think of was for them and himself and maybe hans olsa--to go in a body and show him what to do, and help him to build a house then and there. the thing that he had put up was frankly impossible; the poor man would ruin himself before he got a decent start! . . .

to his great disappointment, the solum boys wouldn't go, either. it was per hansa's own business, they said, what sort of a house he wanted to build for himself. so tönseten had to give it up as a bad job. he shook his head solemnly. . . . a damned shame, that a perfectly good man had to go to ruin through sheer folly!

per hansa had put a great deal of thought into this matter of building a house; ever since he had first seen a sod hut he had pondered the problem. on the day that he was coming home from sioux falls a brilliant idea had struck him--an idea which had seemed

and beast in one building? how could one live that way? . . . at first it seemed utterly impossible to her; but then she thought of how desolate and lonesome everything was here and of what a comfortable companion rosie might be on dark evenings and during the long winter nights. she shuddered, and answered her husband that it made no difference to her whichever way he built, so long as it was snug and warm; but she said nothing about the real reason that had changed her mind.

this answer made per hansa very happy.

"beret-girl, you are the most sensible woman that i know! . . . of course it's better all around, for us to build that way!"

he, too, had reasons that he kept to himself. . . . now he would get ahead of both hans olsa and the solum boys! none of them had even begun to think of building a barn yet; while according to his plan, his barn would be finished when his house was done.

one evening per hansa came over with his oxen to hans olsa's to borrow his new wagon; the time

 had come to get his poles for the thatching. the others had been able to gather what they needed along the banks of a creek some ten miles to the southward, where a fringe of scattering willows grew; but it was small stock and a scanty supply at that; their roofs were certainly none too strong, and might not hold up through the next winter. . . . per hansa had a bigger and more original scheme in mind. if conditions were really as bad as tönseten had made out, he'd have to find something besides willow poles for rafters on that house of his. the busy season of spring was over; now he proposed to rest on his oars awhile . . . take a little time to nose around the prairie at his leisure. he had been told that the sioux river was only twenty-five or thirty miles away; big stands of timber were reported to lie in that direction, and several settleme

oo--everything was going! . . . and on top of it all, this youngster who wasn't dry behind the ears yet had grown so conceited that he wouldn't deign to talk to his brother; he kept fussing and smirking around his father all the time, speaking to him in low, confidential tones, and pushing himself to the front on every occasion! he seemed to be bubbling over with foolish questions. shouldn't they take this along, and this, and this? . . . but when at last he came dragging a piece of chain, even per hansa had to laugh outright. "that's the boy, now! i might have forgotten the chain. and how could we go to the woods without a chain, i'd like to know?"

beret got the food ready for the journey. her face wore a sad, sober expression. . . . yes, of course, the house must have a roof; she knew that perfectly well. how could they live in a house without a roof? . . . but now he was going to be away for another two-day stretch--two whole days and a night! . . . it wasn't so bad in the daytime . . . but

"you'd better take the children with you and go over to mother sörrina's to-morrow evening," per hansa advised her, cheerfully. "you can spend the whole evening there, you know, visiting and talking. it'll make the time pass quicker, and you won't be so lonesome. . . . you do that, beret!"

to this suggestion she answered neither yes nor no. in her heart she knew very well that she wouldn't follow his advice. she never could forget that evening of his trip to sioux falls, when she and the children had come down the hill toward the wagons; the air of the place had suddenly filled with terror and

this was destined to be a memorable journey, both for those who went and for those who stayed at home. . . . before it was over the latter were in a panic of apprehension and fear. the second day passed as the first had done; the second night, too; the third day came . . . noon, but no one in sight.

beret had not really begun to expect them until sometime during the second day; per hansa had told her not to begin looking before they came in sight. nevertheless, she had found herself unconsciously doing it shortly after dinner on the very first day. she knew that it was foolish--they hadn't even got there yet; but she couldn't refrain from scanning the sky line in the quarter where they had disappeared. . . . she went to bed with the children early that evening.

the following evening she took them up on the hill; they sat there silently, gazing eastward over the plain. from thi

--hadn't per hansa returned yet?

--no. she couldn't imagine what had become of him. he surely ought to have been home by this time.

--oh, well, she mustn't worry; he had probably travelled a long way on this trip; no doubt he had made use of the opportunity to look around for winter fuel.

--winter fuel? . . . she had never given a thought to that before; but of course they would need wood if they were going to stay through the winter. it suddenly occurred to her how much there was for per hansa to plan about a

e; it was the thing they needed most of all!

mother sörine was well aware that her neighbour did not have any courage to spare. she realized, too, how lonesome it must be for beret, to sleep over there in the wagon with only the children. as the visitors were leaving she got up, called her daughter, and insisted on accompanying them back to the wagon. they chatted gaily and freely all the way . . . and that night there was no magic circle to step across!

some time after noon on the third day per hansa and store-hans came home with a load so big that the oxen were just barely able to sag up the slope with it. it was like an incident out of a fairy tale, that famous load. there was a stout timber for the ridgepole, there were crossbeams and scantlings, and rafters for the roof; but ole only sneered at such prosaic things. was that all they had gone for, he'd like to know? farther down in the load, however, lay six bundles of young trees; their tops had been trimmed off, and the soil had been c

ght his breath from sheer excitement. . . . there were still stranger things in that load. in the back of the wagon, as the father unloaded, an opening almost like a small room was gradually revealed. here lay two great bags--two bags brimful of curious articles. one of them evidently contained fish; the other seemed to hold the flayed carcass of a calf; at least, ole thought so, and wanted to know where it had come from.

"calf!" exclaimed store-hans. "what makes you think it's a calf?" . . .

per hansa winked slyly at his travelling companion; the wink warned him that he'd better say no more--for a little while! . . . store-hans assumed a knowing silence; but it could be seen with half an eye that he was bursting with important secrets. at last he was no longer able to contain himself.

. . . "antelope!" he burst out, ecstatically.

beret watched with speechless admiration the unloading of all the wonderful things that they had brought; she was so overjoyed to have her dear ones with her agai

n that she could have burst into hysterical tears; as she stood beside the oxen she stroked their necks fondly, murmuring in a low voice that they were nice fellows to have hauled home such a heavy load.

. . . "well, there!" said per hansa at last, when he had cleared the wagon. "now, this is the idea: store-hans and i have figured on having fresh fish to-day, cooked in regular nordland fashion, with soup and everything. we nearly killed ourselves, and the beasts, too, to get here in time. . . . beret, what the devil have we got to put all this meat and fish into?"

store-hans ate that day as if he could never get enough; there seemed to be no bottom to the boy. . . . when he had finished the father chased him off to bed at once;

 and strange to say, he wasn't at all unwilling though it was only the latter part of the afternoon. when evening came the mother tried to shake life into him again, but without success; once he roused enough to sit up in bed, but couldn't get so far as to take off his clothes; the next moment he had thrown himself flat once more and was sleeping like a log.

as time went on this first expedition of per hansa's came to be of great consequence to the new settlement on spring creek. . . . in the first place, there were all the trees that he had brought home and planted. this alone excited tönseten's enthusiasm to such a pitch that he was for leaving at once to get a supply of his own; but hans olsa and the solum boys advised him to wait until the coming fall, so tönseten reluctantly had to give up still another plan.

. . . but there were other things to do when fall came, and several years went by

before the others had followed per hansa's lead. this is the reason why, in the course of time, a stout grove of trees began to grow up around per hansa's house before anything larger than a bush was to be seen elsewhere in the whole neighbourhood.

but the most important result of all, perhaps, was the acquaintance with the trönders eastward on the sioux river, which sprang out of this journey. amid these strange surroundings, confronted by new problems, the two tribes, trönder and helgelander, met in a quite different relationship than on the lofoten fishing grounds. here they were glad enough to join forces in their common fight against th

othing to yield. the settlers shared freely with one another as long as they had anything left; but even at hans olsa's, where plenty usually reigned, the food at last began to give out. among the menfolk a crumb of tobacco was as rare as gold. . . . high time that they took the situation in hand and did something about it! besides, the season was getting so far advanced that they would soon have to start in haying. no two ways about it--they must make a trip to town.

all the men, accordingly--per hansa, and tönseten, and hans olsa, and the two solum boys--met together one sunday to discuss the matter. a trip to town in those days was a serious affair, which had to be planned carefully from beginning to end. the seventy or eighty miles through desolate country was in itself no trifle; one couldn't expect to be back in less than four days, even with horses. and under pressure of time, it was hard to accomplish everything that one wanted to do. provisions of all sorts must be replenished for th

ll right, however; no one was seriously hurt . . . this time.

and then, the indians! . . . "injuns," as the red children of the great plain were called in common speech. kjersti, tönseten's wife, didn't mind the storms so much; they never committed inhuman outrages . . . weren't out for your scalp, at any rate! but fear of the indians was ever vividly present in her mind. not a day passed that she didn't search the sky line many times. . . . why, one of the savages actually lay buried over on per hansa's land! and where the dead had their abode, the living were sure to come. . . . since she had learned of the grave she was always on the lookout. . . .

truth to tell, her fear of the indians was very natural. she and syvert had heard the tale of the terrors of '62 so often that they could have repeated it word for word, as if from an open book. when they were living in fillmore county, minnesota, two refugees from the norway lake massacre had drifted into the place; the story of the horrors th

ey had undergone had taken on new and gruesome details as it passed from mouth to mouth; out here now on the open prairie, where no hiding place could be found, the form in which kjersti remembered it had assumed the fantastic proportions of a myth.

tönseten, however, wasn't a bit afraid of the indians--not he! who ever heard of such nonsense? why should he or anyone else fear them, now that they had become peaceful and civilized? he tried his best to instill this idea into the others. . . . per hansa would sit listening to tönseten with a quizzical smile on his face. "that's right, syvert--go on," he would agree. "all the indians have turned into honest-to-god gentlemen these last ten years, with red skull-caps, and wooden shoes, and long pipes, and everything else they need. it's no trick at all, you know, for a savage to learn fine manners, as crowded with folks to teach him as it is out here!" . . . from the trönders on the sioux river, per hansa had learned a great deal of valuable in

formation about the indians; he had heard of a place, not very far away, called flandreau or some such outlandish name, where they had a permanent colony; west from this place an indian trail ran all the way through to nebraska, and along this route the red man was said to make his yearly journeys. more than likely, per hansa thought, his own quarter-section lay directly in their path; he inferred this from the grave on the hill and from what he had heard. . . . if it were true, the fact would be certain to come to light before the summer was over. in the meanwhile--well, no use to cross a bridge until you came to it.

the men never spoke of the indians while the womenfolk were around. but at other times, whenever the subject came up for discussion, ole and store-hans stood listening with open mouths. . . . the grav

kjersti feared the indians, sörine the storms; and beret, poor thing, feared both--and feared the very air.

the outcome of their deliberations that sunday was only what might have been expected; it seemed the logical thing for hans olsa and tönseten and henry solum, each of whom owned horses and wagon, to make up the party for the journey. that would give three men and three separate teams; such a caravan ought to be able to haul home on one trip whatever the settlement could afford to buy.

per hansa was badly out of sorts that day; every word that he let fall had a bitter sting to it; he said little and sat morose and silent most of the time. in his eyes, the whole affair had the appearance of having been settled beforehand. he and the other solum boy were to stay at home and look after the settlement; that was the plan, though it hadn't been stated in outright terms. it looked to per hansa like a pretty mean piece of business. . . . for his part, he took it as a matter of course that he w

as a better man for the trip to town than syvert tönseten or henry solum--neither of whom, god knows, had any more wits than he could get along with! . . . in all their talk, no one had even hinted at that side of the question. and certainly per hansa wasn't the sort of man to force himself down anybody's throat. . . . but, by god! it was disgusting to have to lie around the house with the womenfolk while the others were off on such a fine expedition! . . . the thirst for adventure was burning in his blood.

when the party left on monday morning per hansa was in a towering ill humour; he rose with the others at dawn, woke ole, and hitched the oxen to the plow. on that day he broke up an acre and a half of prairie, with only the crude impleme

itting time that night, when he paced around the field and discovered what an enormous day's work he had done, he felt so elated that he began to whistle the tune of an old ballad. . . . just look at that! if they didn't hurry back, he'd have the whole farm broken up before they arrived. . . . by god! he'd show them! he'd give them a chance to see for themselves who was the better man!

the next day he did not drive himself so hard; but he turned off a good day's work, just the same.

per hansa was again in a good humour that afternoon as he and ole sauntered home from the field; he felt that during this interval he would easily get ahead of tönseten. ole's tired feet dragged at every step; his voice was hoarse from steadily shouting at the oxen.

they had not got far on their way home when store-hans came running out to meet them; he began shouting as soon as he caught sight of them, and arrived all out of breath.

"dad . . . quick . . . people are coming!" . . .

 brother with his mouth wide open, but the father only laughed as he looked indulgently at the boy.

"of course people are coming!" he said with a chuckle. . . . "and you'll grow up to be a man, too, some day--at about the same rate, i guess! you've both got a long distance yet to travel."

but store-hans was too excited to be thrown off the track by his father's kindly sarcasm.

"look! . . . look there!" he cried, pointing toward the southwest. . . . "mother thinks they may be indians!" . . .

per hansa took in the whole western horizon in one swift glance . . . "huh!" he grunted . . . and immediately began to walk faster. the longer he looked, the more haste he made. at last he was taking such mighty strides that the boys had to run in order to keep up with him.

beret was standing just beyond the wagon, holding and-ongen in her arms.

"they have come," she said in a calm voice; but her sad, resigned face was pale and drawn.

"well, don't stand there! . . . go and look after the cooking as if

 nothing had happened!" . . . he spoke rapidly, with a metallic ring in his voice.

in an instant he was over at the new house, which as yet was only half thatched. the boys followed close at his heels; he spoke to them in quick, low tones; all his words had the same hard, metallic ring.

"hans, run over to sam's and tell him what's up. . . . hurry, now!"

"yes." . . . the boy hesitated.

"hurry, i said!"

"yes, sir!" . . . store-hans found his legs and was off like lightning.

per hansa turned to ole. "you go and get old maria. you'll find her in the big chest--and something to load her with in the till. stand the gun and everything just inside the door here. . . . and listen"--his face was hard set--"when i whistle, i want her--but not before! . . . are you afraid?"

"n-n-no." . . . ole ran to execute the order.

per hansa began to work away at the thatching as if nothing unusual were going on; but his eyes were steadily fixed on the approaching train. little by little, as he

 watched, he grew calmer; the look of anxiety slowly faded away from his features, to be replaced by the half-sly, half-roguish expression of his lighter moods. . . . no war party, this--nothing but harmless families roaming over the plain!

just then ole arrived with the rifle.

"never mind," said per hansa. he was laughing now. "go back and hide those things where you found them. . . . that fellow store-hans is a regular little rascal--the way he nearly scared us out of our wits!"

"but don't you want the gun, father?"

"no, i guess not. . . . go and put her back--then come and run an errand for me."

the boy ran inside, and returned in a moment empty-handed. per hansa was sitting on the edge of the roof; he kept looking off to the westward as he gave his orders:

"run over and tell sörrina that

 the indians are coming, but don't frighten the life out of her. tell her it's only a wandering tribe--just peaceful people like ourselves. . . . and tell her they are likely to camp for the night over here on the hill; if she is afraid, she can stay with us. . . . don't get off a lot of wild talk, now. be sensible!"

almost before he had heard the words, ole was gone. . . . per hansa came down to the ground, heaved an armful of sod up on the roof, and then climbed back unconcernedly to his work.

the band of indians crawled slowly toward them out of the west. per hansa counted the teams--fourteen in all, he made it--but he couldn't be certain of the exact number; they drove close together and were headed straight in the direction of the settlement. . . . no doubt about it any longer--here lay an old indian trail!

he was kneeling on the roof awhile later, trying to fit a st

rip of sod in place, when suddenly a figure stood below him; it had appeared so swiftly and silently that per hansa was startled in spite of himself. . . . the next moment he saw that it was sam solum, frightened and excited, gun in hand. he had run so fast that store-hans had been left far behind.

"you must be going hunting to-night," per hansa observed, dryly.

"haven't you seen 'em? . . . don't you know . . .?" sam had to stop to catch his breath.

"seen who?"

"the indians! . . . they're right on top of us!"

"i see you look like the scared fool you are, all right! . . . what are you ramming around with that rattletrap of a gun of yours for? put it out of sight as quick as you can! then come here and help me with the thatching. . . . store-hans, you'd better go and stay with mother."

sam did as he was bid, without half understandi

ng; he took his gun inside the house, stood it against the wall, and came out again; in front of the door he paused, staring open-mouthed at the approaching train. . . . seated above him on the roof, per hansa glanced alternately westward and down at the puzzled youth.

"i supposed we ought to warn kjersti--she's always so skittish," he said with a grin. "why don't you go down and tell her that our red neighbours are coming? . . . but don't scare the wits out of the poor woman!"

sam hesitated; the task obviously wasn't to his liking.

. . . "or should we wait, and let the indians take her scalp?"

at these words sam jumped, then suddenly broke into a run.

per hansa laughed heartily as he watched hi

e lookout, as usual. . . . at that moment she hove in sight on the slope of the hill, leading her cow.

at the same time ole arrived, with sörine and the girl close behind him; but sörine, unfortunately, hadn't thought of her cow, which was grazing off on the prairie to the westward, some distance from hans olsa's house.

soon they were all gathered in a little knot--the three women, ole, and the solum boy; but store-hans felt that it would be safer with his father, and had gone over to where per hansa was still working. . . . kjersti was moaning and wailing because her syvert was away at a time when the lord sent such tribulations upon her; mother sörine was comforting her as best she could, saying that, after all, indians were only people--human beings . . . just human beings! . . . beret listened in stony silence to it all.

at last per hansa took a quick slide down from the roof and went over to the agitated group.

"what have we here--a sewing circle? . . . by george! it seems to me tha

t three nice modest girls like you oughtn't to be standing around and making eyes at strange menfolk! they've got their own women with 'em, too. . . . maybe the squaws would have a word or two to say about that!"

per hansa's sally broke the tension; beret immediately resumed her preparations for supper, and mother sörine began to help her, kjersti found a pail and milked her cow; and per hansa himself went back to his roof and laid a few more strips of sod before supper was ready.

. . . while they sat waiting for the porridge to cool, they watched with anxious attention the indian band as it crept up the slope of the hill toward the crest. the foremost team reached the summit, passed some distance beyond it on the other side, and came to a halt; at that they all drew up, the whole train forming a crescent around the brow of the hill, facing the house of per hansa. one by

just then, however, sörine's cow, which was still grazing some distance off on the prairie, suddenly seemed to go crazy. she bellowed loud and long, lifted her head and tail high in the air, and galloped away toward the wagons of the newcomers. all watched her in amazement. sörine burst out crying, blaming herself for being so shortsighted as to forget all about her precious

cow. . . . as he saw the beast gallop away, per hansa cursed it from the bottom of his heart.

in an instant, before the little company sitting there had found time to gather their scattered wits, all the rest of their cattle were smitten by the same craze. at the first bellow of sörine's cow they had looked up inquiringly, had caught sight of the new arrivals, and at once had started off behind their leader--rosie first, then kjersti's brindlesides--both rearing their tails on high and galloping straight toward the camp of the indians.

. . . "d

amn the luck!" muttered per hansa between his teeth. "there goes the milk for our porridge! . . . the devil salt and burn their blasted tails!"

a far-away "moo-o-o" drifted in from the north, and there the solum boys' daisy came running at full speed, to join the deserters!1

 

1 the cattle of the first settlers, from the wandering habits they had formed during the outward journey, had to be watched, for they wanted to join every caravan that came along.

 

at that per hansa burst into a loud laugh. . . . "you'd better go after your cow," he said to sam, "unless you want to munch dry porridge all winter!"

the women took the matter each in her own way, according to her feeling for her particular cow. kjersti wept and took on, vowing that this was the worst thing that had ever happened to her--it was just awful; sörine's eyes were moist, but she believed that her cow would come back, just the same; she had never seen a better cow than dolly and had tended her like

a mother. . . . but beret remained quite calm; she seemed more annoyed than frightened. why didn't one of the men go after the cows? . . . when they remained sitting and made no move, she rose and laid her spoon aside.

"we must get them at once," she announced, firmly. "if the indians were to leave to-night, the cows would follow--that is perfectly plain!" . . . she took and-ongen in her arms and started for the hill.

"good heavens, beret," cried kjersti in despair. "you must be crazy!"

per hansa gazed fondly at his wife; across his face came a light that almost made him handsome. . . . there was a woman for you! . . . he got up before she had gone many steps, and ran to her side.

"go back and eat, beret-girl! there isn't anything to worry about, really and truly. . . . leave the cows to me. it can just as well wait till after we have eaten. . . . we must behave like well-mannered folk, you know."

as they sat over the last of their porridge per hansa drew such ghastly pictures to sam

beret looked at him reproachfully. it seemed to her that it ill behooved him to talk in this fashion; if they were all afraid, they couldn't help it; the words sounded coarse in his mouth, and seemed to coarsen him also. . . . "can't you shut up with that talk!" she said in her quiet, cutting way, without looking up. "it isn't such a brave and manly thing, to terrorize poor womenfolk who are frightened already."

per hansa fell suddenly silent; his face grew burning red. in all the years that they had lived together it had never happened till now that she had shamed him before others. and she had spoken so quietly--hadn't even looked up! . . . he ate his porridge slowly and thoughtfully. what she had said kept repeating itself in his mind, and cut deeper each time.

"i suppose in all fairness, sam, you ought to go chasing your own damned beast--you who are such a sharper in both the american and indian languages!" he snapped out. . . . "but--oh, well, there might be some women over there who were worth having a look at!" he muttered with plain insinuation. "i guess i'd better go myself and make it a good job!"

store-hans jumped up like a flash and put his hand in his father's. . . . per hansa glanced down into the beaming, ruddy face that smiled up at him and begged so earnestly. . . . but the boy uttered never a word.

"come along, then," said the father. still holding the outstretched hand, he began to walk away.

"hans, come here!" his mother cried out, sharply. a wild anxiety had come into her voice--a note of desperate pleading.

"no," said per hansa, shortly. "hans is going with me." . . . he waited for no answer, but grasped the boy's hand firmly and started off.

tore-hans had been too absorbed in what was going on to notice the clash between his parents. as they went along, his whole being was athrill with excitement; he took long, manly strides, and chattered on in a low, rapid voice, but always returned to the same question:

--what was his father going to do to the indians?

--do? . . . per hansa's mind refused to act any further. the biting words of his wife, spoken in the plain hearing of all, kept ringing in his ears.

"yes, dad, what are you going to do?"

"we'll see about that later." . . . he tried to wrench himself out of his abstraction, repeating in a loud tone: "we'll see later--when the time comes!"

"are you . . . are you going to fight them, dad?"

per hansa gave the boy's hand a good squeeze. "i guess we'll have to be satisfied with a scalp or two!"

the only thing store-h

--oh, nothing much. . . . didn't he know how it was done?

"no. . . . please tell me, dad?"

per hansa shifted the empty pipe to the other corner of his mouth; he laughed as he said:

"you see, store-hans, when the hide begins to get good and dry on the heads of some people, then the indians peel it off."

"does it grow out new again?" store-hans gave a sidewise glance at the top of his father's head; before he realized it, his hand had gone up under his own cap.

"oh, i suppose so."

"but . . . but doesn't it hurt awfully?"

"no, not at all . . . that is, when the skin is good and dry."

eemed quite logical; store-hans grasped it immediately.

"but what do they do with the scalp?"

"what do they do with the scalp?" per hansa spoke slowly, as if his mind were elsewhere. . . . "they use it, i guess . . . for mittens, and things like that. . . . they turn the hair side in, you see." . . .

"oh, you're only fooling!" cried store-hans, lengthening his stride in order not to fall behind.

"maybe i am fooling. . . . i thought you knew all about it, though."

the boy was dying to ask about other things; but he was getting afraid to raise his voice now--his throat, too, seemed very dry. . . . and, besides, they were drawing

the rough tents, constructed of poles and hides, stood some distance back of the semicircle of oddly-assorted vehicles. halfway between, a group of dusky squaws were busy at a fire, carrying wood from the wagons and throwing it on; around the fire several bronzed men were sitting motionless, with their legs crossed under them. . . . these men were smoking--that was the first thing that caught per hansa's eye. the flames of the camp fire threw a lurid glare over the figures sitting around it, turning their copper-coloured faces to a still deeper hue, their raven hair to a more intense and glistening black. they smoked on in silence.

when the two visitors had arrived within the illuminated circle, one of the indians pointed to them with his pipe; a few words were spoken among them in a guttural tongue; beyond this the coming of per hansa and his son created not a ripple of excitement.

but in this crisis store-hans, who had been half hiding behind his father, came to his aid; he whispered, rapidly:

"they want to know if we live here."

"how the devil could you tell that? . . . by god! i guess we do!" per hansa nodded emphatically toward the indians. "tell them there isn't any doubt of it--not the least doubt in the world--but say it nicely, now!"

store-hans stepped out in front, facing the seated redskins; he tri

the visit was soon over; after that strange, impassive meeting there seemed to be nothing else for per hansa to say or do. the stray cows, all four of them, had finally lain down beside the indian wagons; he would only need to round them up and drive them home. . . . yet there was something that made it almost impossible for him to tear himself away. the odour from the pipes wafted to him so enchantingly on the evening breeze, enthralled and held him captive. he hadn't had a decent smoke for over two weeks, and he could smell that this was good strong tobacco.

at last the temptation grew altogether t

oo powerful; he simply couldn't resist it any longer. he glanced around the circle, picked out the face that looked to him the most approachable, then took the empty pipe from his mouth and indicated by signs that he needed something to fill it with.

the man he had chosen understood him perfectly. he gave a laugh, remarked something to the others, pulled a large leather pouch from his shirt, and held it out with a dignified gesture. per hansa grasped the pouch with an eager hand, took a deep dive into it, and gave his pipe a good fill. . . . "many thanks, good friend! if hans olsa happens to get back before you're gone, i'll see that you are well repaid! . . . hans, translate that to him the best way you know how. . . . what a thundering shame that we can't talk with such good folks!" . . . per hansa went over to the fire, raked out a glowing ember, lit his pipe, and pulled at it long and deeply, while an expression of rare contentm

turning away from the fire, as he stood there enjoying his smoke, he noticed a face on the ground at his side--a face that peered out of the folds of a gaudily coloured blanket, so close to the fire that it startled him. . . . good lord! was the man trying to singe himself?

per hansa stared down into the face incredulously; the form in the blanket gazed up as fixedly at him in return. it struck him at once that the indian must be suffering terrible pain; his features were distorted in agony.

"store-hans!" he called, hastily. "come here and ask this fellow what's the matter with him. it looks to me as if he were fighting death itself!"

again store-hans had to try out his meagre stock of newcomer english on the indians. the face moaned; in a moment it gave answer. the boy r

epeated his question; a second answer came, and then another long moan.

"he says his hand is hurt," store-hans reported.

"is that it? too bad! . . . tell him i'd like to take a look at that hand of his."

but store-hans didn't have to repeat the request. the man had been lying there watching them as they spoke together, looking closely and intently at per hansa. now he got up beside him without a word; first he removed the blanket from his arm, and then unwound a bundle of dirty coloured rags that were wrapped around his hand.

when this was done, he held out an ugly-looking claw, swollen to the size of a log; not only the hand, but the wrist and a large part of the arm as well were badly swollen and infected. the evil seemed to have its source in a festering wound in the palm of the hand. . . . per hansa examined the hand, felt of it, squeezed it, an

 for clean white rags was either beyond his english or a little too much for their comprehension.

the sick indian had kept his eyes intently fixed on the man who was examining his hand with all the assurance of an expert. others had now risen and come up to them, one by one. a close circle had formed about the little group. the women were also joining it; the children stopped playing and slipped in among their elders; at last the whole camp had gathered in a silent ring around the three. . . . per hansa's face wore a sober expression, but all the while he kept drawing long, deep puffs from his pipe.

"seventeen devils of a claw you've got, man!" he exclaimed at last, when he had finished his diagnosis. . . . "i can't see any way out of it, store-hans. you'll have to run home and get mother. tell her an old chief is lying over here almost ready to die--tell her it's blood poisoning. she must bring the small kettle, and all the clean rags she can spare. can you remember to say white rags? . . .

ected to have. . . . he had already pressed his way through the throng when his father thought of something which he had forgotten, and called him back.

. . . "tell sörrina to go home and see if there isn't a drop left in hans olsa's bottle. even if it isn't more than a thimbleful, we ought to have it; it's a matter of life or death here. . . . and mother must bring some pepper. . . . let's see, now, how well you can remember everything!"

the boy was off like a flash. as soon as he had gone, per hansa began treating the hand. first of all, he made them understand that he needed water to wash his own hands. . . . "yes, water, water!" he said, going through the motion of dipping his hands and rubbing them. they caught his meaning at once; the word was passed among them, and a woman immediately brought some water in a tin bucket.

per hansa washed his hands very carefully; then he poured out the water and motioned for more. . . . "yes, yes--more, more!" . . . he got it at once and began to wash

 the wound--first the hand, and then the wrist and the arm, but particularly the hand, and the wound itself most of all. . . . brown it had been in the beginning, that skin--and brown it remained; per hansa couldn't be certain whether he had got it clean. but now he led the man as close to the fire as the heat would allow; there he sat down with him, and began to draw on the great store of experience he had gathered as a fisherman on the lofoten seas. first he massaged the flesh around the wound for a long time; then he moved upward to the wrist, and afterward to the arm. he rubbed with the palm of his hand, making circular motions, gently for a while, then stronger and firmer; from time to time h

e bent over the hand, breathed heavily on the wound, and continued the rubbing.

at last store-hans returned, bringing his mother, who carried all the articles his father had sent for. per hansa noticed that she had put on her sunday clothes; for some reason, this pleased him. when she stepped within the circle of the camp fire, she paused, greeted the strangers quietly, and dropped a curtsy.

"what do you think you are doing here?" she asked in a low voice; the words seemed to carry more of reproach than fear. . . . he suddenly remembered the incident at supper awhile ago; the wave of bitterness rose again in his heart. . . . what a silly question for a grown woman to ask!

when she r

eceived no answer, she continued:

"kjersti is crying her eyes out--and the rest aren't much better off. . . . these people have got to look after themselves! you must come home at once!"

per hansa still remained silent. . . . this speech was so unlike the beret that he knew, that he glanced up at her quickly.

"give me that kettle! . . . yes--water, water?" he shouted at them, pointing to the kettle. but then he remembered store-hans. . . . "tell them that i want clean water--yes, clean, that's it! and it must be hot, too!"

now he found time to turn to his wife. . . . "oh, well, kjersti isn't going to miscarry to-night! . . . but if you don't want to stay here, to help save a human life

 rest of the things!" her words of an hour before were again ringing loud in his ears; his own voice had taken on an added harshness; he knew it and felt glad.

beret said no more; she stood looking silently at him, flushed and confused.

the kettle had now been placed on the fire.

"where is the salt? . . . we need salt in the water."

he took the antique whisky bottle that sörine had sent; it was still a good half full. the pepper, done up in a little package, had been brought over in a cup. per hansa looked at it for a moment in grave doubt. . . . "no, it's too much--never in the world can he stand all that! . . . hold out your apron, beret, to catch this. . . . there's too much pepper."

"now, don't be so hasty!" she said. she took the pepper from him, made a funnel of the bag, and held it out for him to pour in as much as he wanted.

then per hansa concocted for the sick indian that "horse cure" which is famous among all the inhabitants of nordland. a goodly tablespoonful of pepper lay in

 the cup; he filled it up with whisky, stirred it around, put the bottle down on the ground, and motioned to the indian to drink.

the man took the cup, sniffed at it, and smiled; then he put it to his mouth and took a draught, smacking his lips and making a fearful grimace.

"tell him to drain it off at once, store-hans! . . . he'll live through it--though it does kick powerfully to begin with!"

the indian downed the rest of the mixture without wincing.

as per hansa was pouring the whisky from the bottle a couple of the others had suddenly grown restless; as soon as he set it down, one of these rose to his feet with a jerk and sauntered in their direction; the other followed close at his heels.

"they're taking the bottle!" whispered beret, frightened at their manner.

per hansa whirled like a flash and caught hold of a brown arm; he grasped it firmly and gave it a violent twist. a howl of pain echoed through the camp. . . . "what the hell are you doing!"

cried per hansa, wrenching loose the bottle with his other hand. "that bottle belongs to hans olsa. don't you dare to touch it!" he looked so fiercely at the pair that they slunk off, afraid.

"now come here and help me, woman! . . . hold this bottle, and let the liquor drip down on his hand while i rub it in. . . . right on the wound--only a drop at a time . . . god! did you ever see a nastier-looking hand?"

beret did as he told her, but her own hand was shaking violently. he looked at her closely. her face

"oh, i shall have to stay here part of the night, at least. if we can't make the swelling go down, and that right quick, there's nothing under god's heaven that can save him! i'll have to change the rags every half hour. . . . but you go right along, now, and don't worry!"

beret paused a moment; she gazed at him, saying not a word, but her mouth quivered. then she took store-hans by the hand and walked away.

during the first part of the night per hansa kept constant vigil over the sick man, frequently looking at his watch and changing the bandages; every time the hand was exposed he rubbed in a few more drops from hans olsa's bottle. it was evident from the man's face that the pain was growing no worse; he even slept at intervals.

midnight passed. the whole camp was now asleep; the men lay around like mummies, wrapped in their gaudy blankets, their feet towards the fire. occasionally one of them would rise and throw on more wood; per hansa n

per hansa felt tired and drowsy; he realized that he would have to pull himself together in order to keep going through the middle watch. . . . suddenly he pricked up his ears; in an instant he was wide awake. he had heard a sound like steps in the grass, off on one side--steps that seemed to be hesitating as if in fear. they trod cautiously, drawing closer and closer, then they stopped, as if the person were listening. . . . he glanced around; the sick man slept at his side; all the others seemed to be

sleeping. who could it be, reconnoitring so quietly out there? . . . he got up abruptly, stepped closer to the fire, and stood fully revealed against the glare. now the steps were heard again, firmly approaching. . . . the next moment beret stood within the circle of the camp fire, silently looking at him.

per hansa's eyes leaped out and embraced his wife's form: a great glow of love and tenderness surged through him. . . . "beret-girl, come here!" he called in a low voice. "don't be frightened; the whole crew is asleep!"

she advanced slowly to the side of the fire where he stood; but she did not look at him. her face was flushed and swollen with weeping. . . . "how she must have been crying!'' he thought; and the memory of his harsh words filled him with deep remorse. he went up to her timidly, took her

 stroked the hand he had found. after a while he had tried to say, lightly: "i guess the old fellow is going to pull through, all right." . . . but the moment the words were out of his mouth he felt that he hadn't said the right thing; in his confusion, he asked her how all the others were at home.

she made no response to either of his attempts; then he heard the sick indian stir, and looked around at him. the man lay wide awake, staring at them fixedly with his black, beady eyes.

for a while per hansa busied himself once more with the injured hand; the man sat up as the treatment went on; beret rose and stood close by, watching the operation.

"if you had a string to tie around the rags, so that they wouldn't loosen when they got dry, they would keep the heat longer," she said in a low voice, but calm and clear.

"oh yes! . . . if i only had it!"

she turned away for a moment and began fumbling at her clothes; then, with a bashful but determined air, she handed him one of her home-braided ga

rters. . . . "will this do?" she asked.

"do? . . . my god! beret, that's exactly what we need!" . . . he bound up the sick hand tightly, and tied the garter around the bandage. . . . "the fellow's better already!" he cried. "i can see it in his eyes--and his hand feels softer. . . . but it's still bad enough; he isn't over it yet, by any means!"

when the bandage had been firmly fastened the indian got up, went to one of the wagons, and fetched three heavy blankets; these he gave to per hansa, motioning that they should cover themselves and lie down.

"now, doesn't that show, beret, what decent people they are? . . . i think the fellow will be able to take care of himself for a while. we might as well turn in!" . . . he wrapped one blanket around her, another around himself; then they both lay down with their feet to the fire, and pulled the third blanket over the two of them. per hansa put his arm around his wife and held her close in a fond, protecting embrace. "now try to sleep,

my dear beret-girl!" he whispered, reassuringly . . . she dropped off almost at once, and slept until the crimson dawn fell on the eastern prairie.

 

the indians remained for another day and night. during their stay per hansa spent more time with them than he did at home. store-hans practically lived on the hill, keeping an eye on things. and ole, too, strolled over to the indian camp at odd times. . . . but sam solum let the savages severely alone; and the women, though they were curious to see the camp, felt too timid to venture near.

the indians, for their part, kept strictly to themselves. they did not once approach the houses of the settlement; neither, strange to say, did they allow their women to come over.

it was noon of the third day before they broke camp, to continue the journey northward. the hand of the sick man still looked very bad, but the immediate danger seemed to be over. per hansa had made a sling for him, in which he carried his arm. when the long train of queer-looking teams had got well under way, they saw the sick indian coming down the hill toward the house, leading a fully saddled pony by the bridle; one of the wagons stood waiting for him farther along the hill.

the fellow is probably coming to say good-bye, thought per hansa; he got up and went to meet him. beret and the children followed slowly a little way behind. the man walked straight up to per hansa and ut

tered a few unintelligible words; he laid in per hansa's hand the bridle by which he was leading the pony; then he said a few more words, made a short, stiff bow, turned on his heel and stalked away. . . . he was a tall, broad-shouldered savage, well built and handsome.

"has the old boy gone stark crazy?" exclaimed per hansa. "can you imagine what he means?"

"he wants to give you the pony!" shouted store-hans, his eyes round with wonder.

per hansa roared out an emphatic protest, and started after the stranger. . . . "no, no!" he cried. "that will never do!" . . .

but the indian only strode to the waiting wagon, climbed in, and rode away.

"i've never seen the beat of it in all my born days!" said per hansa, solemnly. he stood as if dumfounded, holding the bridle over his arm. . . . "saddle and everything!" . . .

store-hans gave a leap into the air, turned a somersault, which immediately had to be repeated. never in his life had he felt

 so supremely happy. . . . then he and his brother ran over to claim the prize.

in the evening of the following day the loaded wagons arrived from town; they brought great stores of curiosities, and the men who drove them had many remarkable tales to tell.

hans olsa, who had carried fifteen dollars in cash from per hansa to buy merchandise with besides going surety for him for a plow and a horse rake, came first to their house to unload, before going home. there was a great mountain of bags and packages, sacks and boxes; but best of all were the plow and the rake. the latter, especially,--it was painted in such beautiful, rich colours, red, blue, and green; it looked so impressive standing there in the yard, with its seat reared high in the air . . . like a veritable throne! nothing would do but store-hans must

and try it at once; he was wondering if they couldn't hitch their new pony to this wonderful rig! . . . still more marvellous things than this had come from town; but store-hans was fully occupied for a while and did not see them till later. over at tönseten's stood a mowing machine, which could cut both hay and wheat; this also had a seat high up in the air; and at the solum boys' the sights were equally remarkable.

there was a grand celebration at hans olsa's house that night. tönseten and per hansa arrived long before the others to have a talk together. they found much to do, and many important matters to discuss and settle. everything that had been borrowed during the past season must now be paid back, and that was a complicated affair; for at one time one kind of measure had been used, at another time another; they were all in the same boat. everyone owed everyone else--and now it was time to square the accounts. hans olsa, who during the shortage had had the most to lend, was now left

with enough supplies to stock a good-sized store.

but the goods were what interested per hansa least of all just now; he was eaten up with curiosity, and only wanted to ask questions; he had to hear every detail of their difficulties and adventures on the way. . . . had they run across many people? what news had they picked up? did there seem to be many settlers moving west? how did the prospects look where they had been? . . . was he a fair-minded man, this fellow they had bargained with--the one who had trusted them for the plow and the rake? did he look like a chap who would extend st

ill further credit to a poor devil who had an honest face and came to him in a straightforward way? . . . god knows, per hansa needed such a blessed lot of things!

--yes, hans olsa would say that the man seemed to be a pretty decent sort of fellow; he spoke only english, however, so one couldn't get far with him in the way of talk; this was a bad piece of news for per hansa. his goods were fairly expensive, too; but one couldn't expect anything better out here. . . . on second thought, hans olsa seriously doubted whether it would be possible to get further credit from him. at the start of their dickering, the man wouldn't listen to a word of extending credit; but syvert had argued with him so long and sensibly that he had finally yielded, on condition that they both sign their names as security for the plow and the rake. . . . by this time, anyway, he knew they we

re going to buy so much from him that it wouldn't have paid him to be unreasonable.

the returned voyagers, however, thought that the folks at home had stranger tales than their own to tell. it seemed nothing short of a miracle that per hansa had been able to bring back to life an indian chief with one foot in the grave--those were the very words kjersti had used to her husband. tönseten swore that he had never heard anything so strange; by george! it was more exciting than any storybook ever written!

. . . "i declare, per hansa," said hans olsa, looking at him in open admiration, "it's a queer thing about you! no matter how hard you're put to it, you always give a good account of yourself! . . . i was dead set on having you go al

ong with us this trip; we could have arranged it somehow, you know. syvert and i were speaking about it only the night before we left; but then we both decided that we could feel so much more comfortable about going away, knowing that you were here. . . . it was an act of providence, i say, to leave you home this time!" . . . tönseten nodded yes-and-amen to all that hans olsa had said.

per hansa accepted their homage very modestly; he drew a deep breath and started to reply; but words failed him, and he had to begin all over again.

. . . "oh, well--so much for that, boys. forget it, now! i didn't do anything out of the ordinary. but i might as well own up that when i told ole to get old maria i didn't have any courage to spare! . . . there came the band of indians, thirty strong or more--and here i stood, alone with three crazy women! . . . it looked like far from plain sailing, i can

!" agreed hans olsa. "it's a wonder to me that you didn't take the women and try to run away!"

"yes, but where could i run to? besides, they had horses. . . . the women were crying and carrying on, you know. . . . and just then it crossed my mind, hans olsa, that if you were only near enough to sing out to--and you, too, syvert--i'd gladly have given my right hand, or both of them!"

"sam wasn't much use to you, eh?" asked tönseten.

"no, syvert, sam isn't quite equal to such a job." but then per hansa felt that he had been too harsh; he quickly added: "let's hope that he, too, will have guts some day. . . . the boy has plenty of good qualities. . . ."

meanwhile beret and kjersti had arrived; the solum boys turned up at last, and then they were all gathered. the women had gone with sörine into her new house; they were curious to see what her husband had brought; she had to give both of them a taste from this bag and that. the menfolk remained sitting behind the barn; they had many weighty m

atters to discuss, and didn't want to be interrupted; just now the hay cutting seemed to be the all-absorbing topic. . . . per hansa's boys and hans olsa's girl were chasing one another around the sod hut, playing "indian."

it was a strange thing, however, the number of trips the men had to make into the barn to look at the window and door which hans olsa had brought. there must indeed be something very odd about that window and that door. the men never seemed to be done looking at them; they went in and came out--came out only to go in again; each time they reappeared they were laughing and talking more glibly. the childre

m the interior of the barn, such a smacking of lips, such a steady gurgling--like water running out of a bottle--that the children pressed against the wall outside couldn't help laughing. . . . there, one of them had given a tremendous sneeze! . . . "hush!" whispered sofie. "that was syvert--he must have swallowed wrong!"

. . . something very strange, indeed, whatever it was. . . . now they heard tönseten swear that it was his turn. he had forgotten himself and spoken out loud: "can't i treat per hansa to an honest drink, when he has saved both my wife and my cow from dire death and scalping! . . . toss it off, per, old boy, and let the rest of us get a chance!"

then more jolly laughter and smacking of lips.

"what do you suppose they're doing?" whispered sofie, making a wry face.

"drinking, of course!" said ole, curtly, furious because he was not allowed to be in on this. . . . surely he was grown-up enough to take a drink or two! he could drive the oxen fully as well as his father.

then

bashful and cautious.

"you shouldn't be handing around costly christmas treats in the middle of the haying season!" said tönseten, craftily. . . . "what sort of a housekeeper is this that you've got, hans olsa?"

"oh, come on, syvert!" laughed sörine.

--what, he? good gracious! no--he wouldn't have anything! he couldn't stand liquor right after supper, anyway. . . . she ought not to lead a weak brother into temptation!

but he was chuckling, and his four companions were chuckling with him.

per hansa pushed hans olsa forward.

"here, hans olsa, you are the boss of this house. show us how the thing ought to be done. . . . syvert, you see, isn't feeling well, poor devil!"

--now, it would never do for him to be first--this was hans olsa's ruling. where he had been brought up, that wasn't considered proper.

"if you don't come at once and take this glass," said sörine with mock severity, "i'll pour it back into the bottle. . . . then you can stand there wishing for it as much as you please!"

he manner of such events, it came while everything seemed safe and serene and even the thought of ill luck was far away.

they had finished their afternoon lunch. hans olsa was cutting hay; his new machine hummed lustily over the prairie, shearing the grass so evenly and so close to the ground that his heart leaped with joy to behold the sight. . . . what a difference, this, from pounding away with an old scythe, on steep, stony hillsides! . . . all the men had gathered around to see him start; per hansa had returned home from that send-off firmly determined to get another cow for the winter, even if he had to steal one; for with such a machine it would be nothing to cut the hay.

per hansa was finishing his thatching that afternoon. ole and store-hans were helping; even beret came out from time to time to lend a hand. the father was chatting with the boys, who answered him gayly; now and then they became so boisterous and laughed so heartily together that little and-ongen wanted to get up on t

he roof with them. some distance away the pony was tethered; the boys petted him constantly, and already he seemed so tame that in a short while it would be safe to turn him loose.

tönseten was breaking some new land, with sam as helper, from his high lookout, per hansa had just noticed how well syvert was getting along with his field. but wait a bit, my good syvert, wait a bit! . . . per hansa simply didn't feel like hurrying to-day. he shouted down once more to beret, asking her to see whether the roof would hold water, that was one of his little jokes. the point was this: it had sounded so pleasant to hear her voice in the room below while he had been working on the roof; but now that the thatch was on, the low tone in which she naturally spoke didn't carry through the thickness of the sod; he missed hearing her, and liked to make her shout now and then. . . . he seemed to notice t

hing could worry him to-day. . . . it was a sin how nervous these women were. good lord! the cows would show up all right at milking time!

"we must begin to search for them at once!" . . . sörine was so earnest and determined about it, that almost unconsciously he found himself looking around. . . . strange, not a beast to be seen! . . . then he, too, became serious; he unhitched the horses, tied one of them to the mowing machine, mounted the other, and rode up the hill.

"we must go and tell per hansa!" said sörine, briskly.

"oh, what's the use!" wailed kjersti, wringing her hands. "you can see for yourself that they are gone! . . . yes, gone--and if anyone is to find them, we'll have to do it!"

sörine was now both angry and frightened--angry with kjersti, frightened over the cows. she hurried on ahead, the other trailing after.

but there was no information to be had at per hansa's either. none of them there had thought of keeping an eye on the cows; the animals had gone around loose ev

ery day, and had invariably come home at milking time in the evening; they never had been in the habit of straying so far away that they couldn't be seen. . . . ole could distinctly remember having noticed them over by the creek, that very forenoon.

per hansa took the matter calmly and made a comforting suggestion; the cows were probably lying down in the tall grass, somewhere along the creek; they'd turn up safe and sound when it came milking time. . . . but just then hans olsa rode up with a very sober face and related that he hadn't seen a sign of life stirring on the whole prairie!

when hans olsa took it that way, and spoke so seriously, per hansa, too, began to get worried; he and the boys at once came down from the roof.

"take the pony, ola,
 
 ___________________________
 
 and ride down to the creek. search upstream first, then turn and go south. if you don't see anything, you'd better notify the solum boys and tönseten." . . . per hansa still believed that the cows would come back all right of their own accord; but he proposed that they all should quit work fairly early; then if the cows hadn't shown up they could get together and decide what was best to be done. for surely the gnomes hadn't taken them underground! . . .

the evening wore on; outside of every hut the settlers stood watching, but no cows appeared. the uneasiness deepened, and that sneaking dread which comes to all when life about them has suddenly and

 mysteriously disappeared. . . . the wind blew from the southwest, driving heavy rain clouds; they hung so low that the grass seemed to bend as they swept over it where the plain swelled up to meet the sky.

a depressing gloom hovered over each of the four families sitting around the supper table. at per hansa's, little and-ongen wept bitterly and inconsolably because she hadn't been taken along to pet rosie while her mother milked. as they were sitting down to supper, the child had asked if they weren't going to milk the cow to-night; beret didn't have the heart to tell her what had happened, and said hastily that she had milked already. the child felt that a great injustice had been done her--that she had been defrauded of something which was hers by right. she had burst out crying and had wanted t

! he'd lash their hides so thoroughly that they wouldn't ever dare to play that trick again! . . . his father shot a glance at the boy, which silenced him immediately. the next moment he, too, had lost his appetite and laid his spoon aside. after a while he went out; though he could hear where his brother was, by certain unmistakable sounds, he did not try to find him; instead he climbed up on the roof and sat there alone.

a little later the whole colony gathered on top of the indian hill near per hansa's. per hansa himself, with beret and the child, came last of all, although they had the shortest distance to walk. away behind them ole sauntered along; but store-hans was nowhere to be seen. the evening lay heavily on the plain. toward the south, where the clouds were massing together, it was already deepening into night. no life, no sound--only the wind moaning under a lowering sky. . . . the evening brought memories to them--memories of half-forgotten tales which people had heard and repeate

 the problem for a while; they said nothing at first; this explanation had at least dispersed the feeling of weirdness that had gripped the colony; but the longer they thought, the more they realized that scant consolation lay in the theory that the indians had enticed the cattle away; for where could they find the indians, or how could they recover the cattle after they had been found? if they had stolen them, they meant to keep them--and keep them they could.

tönseten marched straight up to per hansa; he spoke rapidly, in a voice of great determination:

"if that's the case, by god! you've got to go and get the cows the first thing in the morning--you who are so friendly with the indians. . . . we must have our cows right away!"

"yes, good heavens!" kjersti put it. "how can we get along if that drop of milk is taken away from us? . . . you ought to go this very minute!"

per hansa sat gazing steadily off into the distance; but he said never a word. at kjersti's remark, however, it seemed a

s if something had suddenly stung him; he bounded up from the ground like a rubber ball.

"that's just the job for you and sam! . . . come on, wife, let's go home and get to bed."

with these words he stalked away; everyone could see that now per hansa was thoroughly angry.

rest was a long time in coming to them at per hansa's that night; a strange uneasiness had entered there and would not leave the house.

store-hans had not accompanied them to the hill; his brother found him sitting outside when he came home, and told him what sam had said; he added it as his own opinion that undoubtedly the indians had been there and stolen all the cows! . . . ole had then left his brother and gone in to bed; the father and mother were inside already, getting ready for the night; but time went on and the other boy did not come.

store-hans sick? at that he broke down in earnest, with long heaves and gasps, with sobs so violent that they threatened to choke him. beret spoke to him gently and soothingly; little by little the storm over there in the dark abated, lulled away, and finally seemed to die out altogether . . . except for a flutter or two. . . . suddenly there arose a hoarse sound like that of bellows inhaling the air, which ended in a tear-choked gasp: "rosie! . . . ro-o-sie!"

"stay where you are, beret," said per hansa. "i'll get up and tend to the little fellow!" he pulled on his trousers, and went over in the dark to the boys' bed; his voice was so low that it could hardly be heard.

. . . "come, hansy-boy, i'll tell you a secret!"

he put his arm around the youngster, lifted him out of bed, took a coat from the wall and wrapped it around him, then carried him outside. over by the woodpile, which they had hauled home together from the sioux river, he sat down with the boy in his lap. . . . they began to tal

k. at first only the father did the speaking; but after a while, between sobs, store-hans began to join in. the wind, driving warm raindrops full in their faces, seemed to ask if they had gone crazy, sitting out here at this hour of the night; but they paid not the slightest attention. . . .

store-hans was finding consolation in his father's wise and kindly chat.

. . . "it's a burning shame," per hansa was saying, "that we haven't got two ponies! then you could go with me to-morrow when i ride out to fetch those pesky cows!"

--oh! . . . did he know where they were, then?--slipped out between two sobs.

"of course i do!"

store-hans snuggled deeper into his father's lap at this assurance, feeling an infinite, blissful safety there.

--was it the indians who had taken them?

"certainly not! those were honest indians. . . . you could see that for yourself."

--but where were the cows, then?

 very late; the raindrops were still falling steadily; the father said that they ought to be getting back to bed. but store-hans seemed well contented where he was.

"are you going to start early to-morrow?"

"i suppose so."

"how long will you be gone?"

"that depends on how far i have to go."

"there won't be any danger if the indians come back while you are away. . . . i can talk to them, you know!"

"right you are, son! . . . nothing to worry about as long as i have you here at home!"

then per hansa got up and carried the boy back to bed.

store-hans fell asleep almost as soon as his head touched the pillow. but some time later in the night he suddenly rose to his knees.

"here i come, rosie!" he cried out, clearly--then sank back in a heap on the pillow, and slept on.

at the first faint streaks of day per hansa slipped out of bed, made a fire, and put on the coffeepot. his wife, he noticed, was already awake. he told her to stay in bed; to this she made no reply in words, but s

he got up immediately, dressed herself, and began to prepare him a meal. a small lamp burned in the room; the day was yet too young to give much light.

per hansa sat down at the table and began to eat; the coffee wasn't quite ready; his wife stood over by the stove, waiting for it to boil. an air of fixed determination hung about her; although she had not spoken, he felt it just the same.

all night long beret had been lying there with her eyes wide open, staring up at a picture that would not go away; a picture of a nameless, blue-green solitude, flat, endless, still, with nothing to hide behind. . . some cows were grazing on it. . . . yes, animals of

"does it seem right to you, then," she burst out, wildly, "that i should be left alone here with the children while you are chasing around in the wilderness? . . . you may be gone for a day or a week--how can i know? . . . why can't sam or henry go? they have no one sitting at home waiting for them!" she did not look up from the floor while she was speaking; deep passion burned in her words.

. . . now she has fallen into one of her unreasonable moods, thought per hansa; but perhaps she couldn't help it, poor thing! . . . "it's this way, beret, you see: i don't believe it would be any use for those fellows to go."

"then tönseten will have to do it!" . . . now she was going to cry--he heard it in her voice.

"oh, god almighty! . . . then the cows would surely come home!" he groaned, not far from tears himself.

she did not answer; her rigid form remained standing over by the window, staring out into the drab, dismal dawn.

per hansa said no more, either; he g

but in the same flash he had realized that it wasn't from the direction of the door that the sound had come. . . . he turned to find hans olsa rounding the corner of the house. did hans olsa think of going? well, that was another matter; that man was equal to any task. but who would drive the mowing machine while he was gone? and it looked like fine weather for making hay--it seemed to be clearing. . . . all these thoughts passed through per hansa's head as he watched his neighbour draw near; he wished that hans olsa hadn't come just now . . . no, not just now! his usual frankness was lacking in his greeting:

"you seem to be out early, hans olsa."

"and so are you, i see. i sort of expected it; i wanted to talk to you before you went. . . . you're going, aren't you?"

per hansa glanced aside and did not answer immediately; at last he said, after a long pause: "some one will have to go, i suppose. . . . it seems best for you to keep on w

"i know that you can ride faster than i can--that is the better reason. . . . guess what sörrina told me last night?"

per hansa made no attempt at it; he wasn't in a mood to solve riddles just now. his eyes were on his neighbour, but his thoughts were in the house. . . . she must have heard their voices by this time. . . . would she come out?

. . . "well," said hans olsa, raising his eyebrows significantly, "yesterday morning sörrina suspected that cow of ours of wanting male company!"

per hansa came back to reality with a violent jolt.

"what's that you say, hans olsa?"

"those were her very words--'male company'! .

"ha-ha! . . . ha-ha! . . . she had to have a man, that old dame of yours--and led the others with her into temptation!"

. . . "well, who knows?"

"good enough!" . . . per hansa leaned forward and untied the horse; he sprang quickly into the saddle. . . . "i was thinking of the trönders all last night; now i'm going over and make them a visit. there's no telling when you'll see me back. perhaps you'll keep an eye on things for me here, while i am gone?" . . . he paused, glanced toward the house, and added in a low voice: "be sure and send sörrina over here to-night. . . . and you keep on with the haying as hard as you can; it looks to me as if it were going to clear

ide where the door lay; there he drew up, coughed loudly, listened a moment--then rode away.

. . . in the window looking toward the east a woman's face, tear-stained and swollen with weeping, watched his figure grow less and less in the dim grey light of the breaking day, until at last it had disappeared altogether. . . . to her it seemed as though he were sinking deeper and deeper into an unknown, lifeless sea; the sombre greyness rose and covered him.

 

soon the word was passed around that per hansa had set out eastward to the sioux river, to look for the cattle; everyone was willing to let the matter rest at that. his pony was fleet-footed; there was no need for any of the others to take up the search; they had better wait to see what luck he had. . . . not that tönseten had any faith or hope in the trip. he had kept turning the matter over in his mind all night; he had got from kjersti a detailed account of how the cattle had behaved when the indians came, and when he had risen that mor

ning he had been fully convinced that sam's solution of the riddle was the right and only one. to tönseten's mind, all that remained of the problem was how to get hold of the beasts again without causing bloodshed and war--how to wrest them from the possession of the redskins before they had gobbled them all up. . . . when he heard of per hansa's intended visit to the trönders, he spluttered with anger; he was disgusted, too, with hans olsa because he had not dissuaded him from such a brainless move. . . . but his anger at per hansa simply knew no bounds. so--he was not the courageous fellow, then, that he posed as being! didn't he know that the responsibility for getting the cattle back rested solely on him? for he had been the one who was so friendly with that robber brood. he hadn't chased them back where they had come from, as he

oh no, he had taken gifts from them instead--and been gloriously fooled into the bargain! and why did he waste his time now, in revelling with the trönders on the sioux river? the man had better be made to understand that they needed their cows at once! . . . tönseten went about breathing fire and brimstone, and didn't care who heard him.

the gloom of this loss lay heavy upon the others as well; they went about their work as usual, but their eyes strayed elsewhere.

evening came, but neither per hansa nor the cattle. folks did not care to go to bed; they sat about staring and waiting. all of hans olsa's family went over to beret's; tönseten and kjersti, having first stopped at hans olsa's and found them out, went there, too. the solum boys could see no reason for moping around their hut alone; they soon joined the others. . . . but none of them found cheer in this place, either. beret seemed distant and strangely calm, as if the whole affair didn't in the least concern her. they wondered at

 her manner, it was so unnatural.

when they were leaving, however, she said, quietly, as if musing to herself:

"somehow, i can't figure this out. . . . night has come now; per hansa is wandering off there alone in this endless wilderness. and four grown men are sitting here talking the time away. . . . but aren't the cattle just as much theirs as his? . . . no, i can't seem to figure it out at all. . . ."

over in the bed little and-ongen began to cry for her father; the mother went and sat down beside her; she kept her eyes on the floor. her words still lingered in the air; not a voice cared to answer. there seemed to be nothing to say, and the silence only made the gloom

s!" cried ole. . . . "mother first!" shrieked store-hans, forgetting that they had both been shouting the news. they jumped down from the roof together, jerked open the door, and announced in one breath that their father was coming; the next instant they were gone. the word was first carried to hans olsa, then to tönseten, last of all to the solum boys. in each place the same message: "dad is coming!"--that from ole. . . . "and he's got the cows!"--this from store-hans.

sure enough, here came per hansa riding the pony, and driving before him a small herd of cows. as the caravan came in sight from the several huts, each family proceeded to count the animals. . . . what was the meaning of this? were they seeing double? . . . they counted over again with the same result; every person who tried his hand got one cow too many! there should be only four--now there were five. no getting away from it: five there were! they were easy enough to count; they straggled over the prairie one by one, like bea

ds on a string. . . . per hansa on the pony brought up the rear.

as the people stood outside, looking at the approaching train, they instinctively set out for per hansa's. each had to get his own cow; all were eager to learn where per hansa had been these last two days, and to find out about that fifth cow!

the last question had already been answered in part; before the train had arrived they had made out that the fifth animal wasn't a cow at all! no cow, indeed--but a yearling bull! . . . per hansa himself was barely recognizable; his face was grimy and streaked with sweat, which had been running down it in streams, and still ran as freely as ever. but what they first noticed about the man was that he carried something strapped to his chest--some sort of a box, it looked like. . . . no--wonder of wonders!--it was a bird cage, made of thin slats; and inside lay a rooster and two hens!

beret had stepped outside the house at last; she came forward without paying any attention to the others;

 they felt embarrassed now, and did not dare to approach her; some of them even shrank back as she came near.

. . . "per, what have you brought?" she asked in a low, tender voice, as if she were shy of him.

per hansa was unfastening the cage; he seemed wearied to the point of stupor.

"oh, well," he said with an effort, "since i had to go so far, i thought i might as well do something worth while." . . . he handed her the cage. . . . "here are your chickens, beret. . . . i don't know whether there's any life left in them yet, or not."

beret took the cage, turned slowly away, and walked toward the house. the others all thronged about him, eager to hear what adventures he had met with.

tönseten pushed in a

head:

"i say, per hansa, who is that fellow you brought with the rest of the cattle?"

the shadow of a grin brightened the grimy face:

"that fellow? . . . oh, just a trönder."

"oh-ho! . . . then he must be a good one! trönders, they say. . . . but where did you pick him up?"

per hansa pretended not to hear; he dismounted and threw the bridle to store-hans. . . . "water him now, and feed him well! . . . where did i pick that fellow up? oh, i beguiled a kind trönder woman into letting me take him for a year. i promised her ten dollars into the bargain; that makes exactly two dollars and a half for your share, syvert. but that'll be cheaper for you in the long run, you see, than to chase up and down the whole of dakota territory looking for your cow!"

sörine and kjersti were

 both very outspoken in their gratitude to per hansa; they plainly meant every word that they said. but it seemed to per hansa that the deepest word of wisdom on this occasion was offered by kjersti. she stood listening patiently until the story of his long ride had come to an end; then she remarked, as if quietly musing:

"when lust can be so strong in a dumb brute, what mustn't it be in a human being! . . . i shall never forget this trick you have turned, per hansa!"

. . . at that they all laughed heartily.

what the waving grass revealed

that summer per hansa was transported, was carried farther and ever farther away on the wings of a wondrous fairy tale--a romance in which he was both prince and king, the sole possessor of countless treasures. in this, as in all other fairy tales, the story grew ever more fascinating and dear to the heart, the farther it advanced. per hansa drank it in; he was like the child who constantly cries: "m

e and laughed happily, as if at some pleasant and amusing spectacle. . . . such soil! only to sink the plow into it, to turn over the sod--and there was a field ready for seeding. . . . and this was not just ordinary soil, fit for barley, and oats, and potatoes, and hay, and that sort of thing; indeed, it had been meant for much finer and daintier uses; it was the soil for wheat, the king of all grains! such soil had been especially created by the good lord to bear this noble seed; and here was per hansa, walking around on a hundred and sixty acres of it, all his very own!

a beautiful, alluring thought had begun to beckon him. his first quarter-section was rightly only tillage land; the quarter next to it to the east would be about what he needed for hay and pasture for the cattle; yes, he could even use the one to the west of it, too, if his plans worked out; but he wanted the one to the east first, for it had open water on the creek. these two quarter-sections would make an estate more magni

d beauty! . . . just now, for instance, he beheld a vision so fair that his face shone with a glowing light that transfigured his coarse features; he had suddenly discovered a new object outside the palace of his dreams. . . . yes, sir--there it was! nothing less than a snow-white picket fence around a big, big garden! and many trees grew there, both within and without; some bore apples, others various kinds of fruit: and some . . . some had cones . . . yes, trees with pine cones on them! . . . per hansa's eyes swam and shone; a sudden moisture dimmed his sight; dear god, there really were pine cones hanging from some of the trees! . . . he didn't know where they waited for him, those trees . . . but they would come! . . .

and so per hansa could not be still for a moment. a divine restlessness ran in his blood; he strode forward with outstretched arms toward the wonders of the future, already partly realized. he seemed to have the elfin, playful spirit of a boy; at times he was irresistible; h

bble to be found . . . plague take it all!

ever since the boys had first discovered the ducks they had made a practice of going out to look at them every sunday. each time the birds seemed to have multiplied in numbers. soon the boys never pretended to speak of anything else between themselves; they thought only of the ducks, and of how to get hold of them. . . . their father had not yet found time to go with them and behold this wonder.

then one sunday afternoon, in the early part of august, per hansa went for a stroll westward with store-hans. ole was told to stay at home; it would never do to let mother sit there alone, the father said, when she had three grown men in the family; ole, the older of the two boys, would have to take his turn first. the boy raised such a commotion over this disappointment that his mother said they had better take him along. the father was firm, however; next sunday he himself would stay at home, and then ole could go; but to-day the boy must do as he had been

told.

so it fell to per hansa and store-hans to make the trip alone. plenty of ducks there were, no doubt about that. when he first saw the place per hansa was reminded of the great bird cliffs in finmarken. store-hans pointed at the birds, whispering hoarsely to his father, until he choked, and tears came in his eyes.

--wasn't there any possible way to get a few of 'em?

--well--the father seemed quite serious--one might try salt on their tails.

--salt on their tails? was that any good?

--oh yes--they often did it in the olden days.

but then the father had to laugh, and that spoiled it all. as he stood there gazing longingly at the birds no b

store-hans didn't exactly approve of his father's jocular air; this was no fooling matter. if he only wanted to, he could easily rig up some sort of a contrivance for catching them; he could work miracles when he tried. . . . well then, why didn't he begin to get busy. he certainly saw how thick they were! . . .

but store-hans had to possess his soul in patience awhile longer; no birds were captured on their first trip to the swamps.

it was on the way home from this trip that per hansa made his startling discovery. store-hans had taken a short cut home; he had to hurry back and tell his brother what they had seen. but the father never liked to follow an old path while there was still unexplored land left around him; accordingly, he made a long detour to the westward. he had often wondered how far west his land extended, but had never taken the time to pace it off. since he was headed in that direction now, he might as well pace down the western border line of his and his neig

 pick up the corner; so he turned west again. he would have to be satisfied with an approximate position of tönseten's southwest corner to-day. . . . about here, it ought to be, he thought; he stopped, gazed around, and took his bearings for the walk north. he had been following this course for perhaps a hundred paces when the toe of his boot suddenly struck against a small stake--a little fellow who stood hiding there, nodding in drowsy lonesomeness, just at the edge of a thick tuft of grass. per hansa looked down, saw the stake, and brought up with a violent start. . . . here was tönseten's southwest corner! what, had syvert been so cautious as to put down stakes here, too? a very careful man was syvert, indeed!

per hansa bent down closer to examine the stake. yes, he was right--it was a corner stake; there stood the description, indicating both section and quarter. but the name below . . . the name . . . good god! what was this? he dropped to his knees and peered at it until the letters d

anced before his eyes; he wondered if he were dreaming. the name on the stake wasn't s. h. tönseten at all, as it should have been; if was just o'hara . . . nothing else but o'hara! the letters had been carved on the stake with a knife, and the arrow pointed east, to tönseten's quarter! . . . when per hansa finally rose, he smoothed the grass carefully over with his hand, where his knees had bent it to the ground; the action was quite involuntary.

. . . "well!" he exclaimed, and walked hastily away. but presently he stopped, turned around, and went back to the stake, to read the name once more. in order to be sure that his eyes hadn't deceived him, he spelled it out letter by letter, tracing the carving with his forefinger. . . . no doubt about it--the thing was true!

and now he laid his course

o, he couldn't find any stake here, either. it was now growing so late that he had to quit and go home. . . . a short while before, he had been as happy and light-hearted as a child; he came home full of a weariness greater than he had ever known. . . .

. . . by god! the trolls must be after him! it was only natural that he should meet them somewhere out here; but to think of their coming in just this dirty fashion! . . . ah, well, trolls were trolls, no matter how they came! . . .

per hansa didn't know what to do with himself that evening; he felt that the only thing that would relieve him just now would be to hitch the oxen to the plow and break a stretch of new land. he looked longingly at the oxen, and at the plow over yonder. . . . no, it was the sabbath--and evening already.

his discovery had been so utterly disheartening that he could not have mentioned it to anyone for the price of his soul. he would have liked to tell his wife about it, and hear her opinion; but that was

out of the question; she was disturbed enough already. . . . but per hansa had to do something, or he would go mad; he walked across the yard and sat down on the woodpile; there he remained a long while, staring listlessly at the ground.

. . . these trolls would not be easy to cope with--not if he knew them! . . . but why hadn't he been able to discover their tracks on his own quarter? that was the strangest thing of all!

the boys were only waiting for a chance to talk with their father, now he had been west to the swamps and had seen how thick the birds were there.

self; he edged over to his father's side, laid his hand on the stout thigh, and said in a deep joy:

. . . "weren't there a lot of 'em, dad?" . . .

"what?"

"did you ever see so many ducks in all your life?"

"ducks? . . . no."

"you think we can get some of them, don't you?" asked the boy, in a hushed, confidential tone.

but the father made no answer; he was already far away and did not hear. just then the mother came out with the milk pail on her arm and called loudly to rosie. this reached per hansa's ears; he got up and took the pail from her. . . . "i might as well do the milking, since i'm only sitting here idling away my time." . . . he seemed so absent-minded that she looked hard at him; as he walked away his head drooped forward, his shoulders were slouched down, his whole body seemed strangely shrunken. . . .

the next morning he was up earlier than usual; he left the house without saying a word. as soon as he was gone, beret got up and went to the window to see what became of him. 
 
 ___________________________
 
the early dawn was still in the sky; she saw him stride off westward; soon the slope of the hill hid him from view. . . . it's only the ducks, she thought; i'm glad that he and the boys have found some diversion; but just the same, he ought not to wear himself out over such trifling things. . . . beret turned away from the window, her face heavy with sadness.

the boys were up and the food was on the table when per hansa returned. . . . he was heated as if from a brisk walk, his wife noticed. she had to look at him a second time; there was something queer about his face this morning; it seemed so hard set and forbidding; although it glowed with the heat of his body, it lacked any warmth of expression. instinctively she asked:

"is anything wrong with you, per?"

"no." . . . but he did not look up.

as soon as he had eaten he left the table, telling the boys to come along and help him; now was a good time to pac

e out the west line of their land; it had to be done soon, anyway; perhaps they would break a stretch of ground out there. . . . his words sounded cold and distant; he went out, and said no more.

beret watched him narrowly. . . . there's certainly something the matter with him, she thought.

striking west from the house, per hansa paralleled his own south line, between his land and hans olsa's; he knew exactly how far in from this line the house had been built; so he merely kept along with it, counting the paces. when he had reached the western limit of his quarter, he stood still; the grass had been trampled down all over the place. . . . "this is where it ought to be; the line should run straight north from here." . . . he walked a few paces north to show them the direction. . . . "there ought to be a small black stake

eside her with a monster which would not leave him in peace; but after a while she had fallen asleep again. when she finally opened her eyes the dim grey of dawn was creeping through the window; her husband was up and gone. the room somehow gave her the sensation that he must have left a long time ago; not a sound could be heard anywhere. . . . beret got up, dressed herself hurriedly, and went outdoors. the plow was still there, she noticed, and the oxen lay a short distance from the house; but per hansa was nowhere in sight. . . . she felt so forlorn, so helpless, filled as she was with gnawing loneliness. here she stood, abandoned in the great solitude, not knowing where he had gone nor what the trouble was. . . . what had happened to him? what was he struggling with, that had to be kept from her? . . . she called his name aloud a couple of times; but her voice trembled so strangely that she did not dare to call again. the sound died away unheeded. . . . it seemed to beret that she had never

felt the awful desolation of the place weigh so heavily upon her as on this morning.

in the meantime per hansa was engaged in a very curious task west on the prairie. he had risen before daylight; had gone out and hunted up the spade, which he had stuck under his arm; then he had started off in a general westerly direction. he made a longer detour than necessary around hans olsa's house, watching closely as he went by to see if anyone there was up and stirring; once safely past, he quickened his gait. . . . so he came to a place at the southwest corner of hans olsa's land, where a black imp stood noddin

nd filled the hole almost to the top; next he stopped it up with a sod plug; the grass of the plug grew as stout and green as that around it; he also took good care not to tramp down the grass near the hole, placing his feet lightly, as if he were afraid to rest his full weight on them.

at last he had finished and stood regarding his handiwork. . . . "if they only give the grass time to grow a little. i'll be damned if they can chase hans olsa away on account of that stick of wood!" . . . then per hansa went on to the place when he had found the stake of tönseten's land; here he repeated the performance, but was even more careful not to trample down the grass.

when he returned home that morning he did not arrive from the west, but from the north. the boys were eating breakfast; the mother was busy, but she kept a watch through the window; she saw him come into the yard, stop by the woodpile and throw down the spade--then pause and glance hastily toward the house; but she went on with her wor

the stable was unoccupied as yet; at present it served as tool room, carpenter shop, and storehouse combined; beret also used it for hanging spare clothes. . . . after they were gone, she happened to go into the stable looking for some garments that needed mending. there, quite by chance, she found the stakes; per hansa had hidden them behind the clothes. burnt black to withstand the moisture, they hardly differed in colour from the walls; she would not have seen them at all, except for the carved letters; these stood out in the natural colour of the wood and looked like large worms in the black sod; they startled her--she had to see what they were. she picked the two stakes up and stood turning them over in her hands. . . . here were some figures and letters . . . more letters, that joined together and made s

omething like names. . . . "joe gill," said one; the other, "o'hara." . . .

. . . what strange names, she thought. . . . did people really have such names? if so, they must be indians! . . . she kept turning the stakes over and over. the ends tapered down to a sharp point; they must have been made to stand in the ground; in fact, little particles of soil were clinging to them now. where could per hansa have found them? . . . she put them back, found the garments she was looking for, returned to the house, and sat down to mend. . . .

but she could not dismiss those mysterious stakes from her mind. . . . what did the numbers mean . . . the numbers and letters . . . and then, the names? . . . they must be landmarks. and they had been standing in the ground, too. . . . it suddenly occurred to her that he must have put them in there recently; it was only last week that she had hung up those cloth

she stood motionless in the corner beyond the stove, watching her husband burn the proofs of his guilt; the terror that possessed her now was immeasurably greater than that which she had felt in the morning, when she had called his name and got no answer. . . .

during the weeks that followed, per hansa's temper made him hard of approach; the man seemed driven by a restless energy, an indomitable will that knew but one course--to break as much new land as possible each day. . . .

. . . but no, the explanation didn't sound reasonable; those stakes hadn't stood in the ground all winter--they didn't look that way. . . . by god! the trolls had arrived after tönseten's sod house had been built; they had "beheld the land, and seen that it was good"! . . . so, there was nothing to do but wait for them to come back. . . . not by a breath or a syllable did per hansa betray the secret of what he had done. at one time he had strongly considered telling hans olsa, but had finally given up the idea; better to keep him out of this for the time being! . . . in all this trouble, it never once occurred to him that had there been a prior claim on these quarters, tönseten and hans olsa couldn't have filed on them, and that the act of putting down claim stakes made no difference at all.

in a certain sense, however, his guilt began to appear less fatal in her eyes as she continued to look at it; surely there was enough land out here for everyone; whether they got this quarter or another made no difference. she could not understand why one should make a fuss over a thing like that. . . . but the dishonourableness of the act made her shrink back in disgust. . . . and now a new terror--the te

the wagon held on toward tönseten's; it reached his place and halted. the incident was so unusual and startling that all in the little settlement forgot their good manners and rushed pell-mell over to tönseten's. even beret could not keep away; she put on a clean apron, took and-ongen by the hand, and joined the others. . . . the whole colony, young and old, were gathered there when she arrived--everyone except per hansa. . . . he came up silently at last, carrying a heavy stick.

the company consisted of four men; they were from iowa. . . . no, they didn't intend to stop here; they were bound for a place about seventy miles to the southwest; the land was nearly all taken up around here, they had been told. . . . tönseten and the solum boys were convening with them in english; hans olsa, together with the women and children, stood respectfully listening; as for per hansa, he was all eyes and ears, scrutinizing

hadn't he understood that they were going seventy miles farther? . . .

at last he grew impatient, because he was unable to follow the conversation as well as he wished; he grasped tönseten by the arm and pinched it so hard that he turned around angrily; but the next second he was talking again.

"what sort of people are they?"

"germans. . . . don't bother me now!"

"you must tell them not to stop. . . . we want only norwegians here, you know!"

but tönseten had no time now to waste words on per hansa; that could be attended to in due season; he was deep in a long discussion with the strangers, all about the prospects for the future out here.

these four unexpected evening arrivals stayed with them overnight, and went on their way the next morning; the spring creek settlers had never seen them before; they would perhaps never see them again; but they all felt that this was the greatest event which had yet happened in the settlement. . . . seventy miles farther into the evening glow these fel

lows were going--seventy long miles! then this place would no longer be life's last outpost! . . . folks were coming, were passing on . . . folks who intended to build homes! . . .

. . . a living bulwark was springing up between them and the endless desolation! . . .

before the germans left in the morning they came to examine per hansa's house; tönseten had told them of one of his neighbours who had built a dwelling and stable under one roof; they thought it would be well worth the trouble to go and look at a structure of that kind; they themselves were just beginning, and needed ideas. while they were there per hansa got a chance to sell them some potatoes and vegetables, to the amount of two dollars and seventy-five cents; this was the first produce to be sold out of the settlement on spring creek. . . . tönseten didn't t

the strangers finally managed to make a start late that forenoon; the spring creek folks stood watching the wagon as it grew smaller and smaller, until it was only a dot on the horizon, receding farther and farther under the brow of the heavens; at last it disappeared--but whether into the earth or into the sky, no one could tell. . . .

this visit affected each one differently, according to his own traits and peculiarities; but with all it was a new incentive to let their eyes sca

 come! the next in order of enthusiasm was sörine, to whom faith imparted a glad calmness. hans olsa let every day be sufficient unto itself, enjoyed the confident spirits of the others, and set himself every day to accomplish something needful; he was not a fast worker, but got things done with a peculiar sureness of purpose and steadiness of gait; it did not seem of great importance to him how many new people came; the important thing was how they got along--the folks who were here already.

per hansa was even louder in his optimism than tönseten. now there were settlers to both the east and the southwest of them; far away to the northeast, too, folks were known to have taken up land; the time wasn't far distant when they would have near neighbours all around. there were moments, even, when he felt confident that he would live to see the day when most of the land of the prairie would be taken up; in such moods, there was something fascinating about him; bright emanations of creative force s

eemed to issue out of his square, stocky figure; his whole form became beautiful, the lines of his face soft and delicate; whenever he spoke a tone of deep joy rang in his words. . . . but these moods did not last; when there came a pause in the fairy tale, per hansa fell silent about the future, worked intensely and grew cross and irritable; at such times he was a hard man to deal with.

to beret the visit had seemed nothing but a brief interruption to the endless solitude. the facts were unchangeable--it was useless to juggle with them, or delude oneself; nothing but an eternal, unbroken wilderness encompassed them round about, extending boundlessly in every direction; that these vast plains, so like infinity, should ever be peopled and settled, would be

a greater miracle than for dead men to rise up and walk! . . .

it happened about a week later, that another caravan came creeping slowly out of the evening. this was a great procession--six teams of horses, with the same number of wagons. . . . darkness was already falling when they were sighted. per hansa's boys wanted to start out at once, and were quarrelling over who should ride to meet the strangers; but the father suddenly came and told them both to stay at home; he spoke in such a determined voice that they understood it would be useless to mention the matter again. . . . they shouldn't be running out to meet every stranger, he went on, as though they had never seen people before! time enough to speak with these newcomers to-morrow. he was going over now to find out if they needed any pota

toes. . . . he suited the action to the word.

at hans olsa's house the caravan had not yet been sighted; per hansa saw a light in the window as he passed. tönseten was standing outside when he arrived there; the caravan lay some distance off to the southward, steering too far west to fetch the settlement.

"you're going to have visitors," per hansa greeted his neighbour.

"it looks that way!" chuckled tönseten. . . . "though i'm afraid they're heading a little too far west."

they stood gazing at the train of wagons, now less than a hundred yards away; through the dusk they could just make out the forms of the men driving. kjersti stood behind them in the door, laughing to herself and wondering how she could put them all up for the night. . . . oh, well, if it couldn't be arranged here, per hansa would have to take some of them home to h

is place.

. . . "i wonder what kind of people they are?" tönseten mused. . . . "are they going to pass right by an open door?"

"that's just what they're doing!" said per hansa, curtly, fearing that now the trolls were upon them.

"but surely they can see us?"

"they ought to, if they have eyes!"

the caravan had now drawn abreast of them to the southwest; it was so near that they could hear the panting of the horses; then the foremost wagon swung off a trifle and took a more westerly course; they evidently had no intention of camping here for the night.

"you'd better go over and talk to them, syvert," said kjersti. . . . "we'll make room for them somehow."

tönsete

n gazed at them open-mouthed; tears of disappointment stood in his eyes. . . . "that's a fine way to act!" he spluttered. . . . "hadn't we better go over and invite them?"

per hansa's eyes flashed daggers; his face lighted up with irresistible forcefulness. . . . "we won't bother about that just yet. . . . they might be high-toned, you know--heading for hans olsa's place, or mine!"

the train moved slowly on toward the northwest, until it was on the line between hans olsa's and tönseten's; there the wagons stopped and the horses were unhitched; the newcomers had evidently decided to pitch their camp for the night.

. . . "it's the strangest thing i ever saw!" said tönset

en, as if speaking to himself. "can you imagine anyone coming into a neighbourhood where the houses are standing around as thick as fleas on a dog's back, and not even wanting to talk to the folks who live in 'em? . . . i call it a damned outrage! what's the matter--are they afraid of us?"

"it doesn't seem as if they can really be civilized people!" put in kjersti.

"most likely they've got some nice-looking girls aboard, and are afraid the place is full of knock-about single men!" per hansa explained, calmly.

the three puzzled folks stood there watching and wondering; through the deepening dusk they couldn't make out clearly what the strangers were doing. . . . apparently they were building a fire down on the slope; a glare of flames intermittently rose and spread, waned and reappeared; it seemed to flit back and forth on the ground.

"do you know what, syvert?" per hansa suggested, mischievously. . . . "since those fellows won't come and talk to us, we'd better take a trip over

and visit them. we might even talk them into buying some potatoes--eh? we must watch our chances, you know." . . . he was anxious to get a look at them.

tönseten could see no particular objection, especially since per hansa had an errand with them; but it did seem rather humiliating to go and shake hands with folks who had refused to say "hullo" to them. . . . but after a moment they started on their way.

they had walked only a few steps, however, when he drew up with a jerk. "let's go over to hans olsa's and take him along; he'd like to shake hands with them too, you know."

--not at all--certainly not!--was per hansa's decisive reply. hans olsa knew no more english than he did; and it was devilish awkward to st

and around and stare strangers in the face, without knowing a word they said; he himself would never have thought of going if it hadn't been that they ought to make use of the opportunity to sell some potatoes! . . .

they went on a few steps farther, and then tönseten stopped again; his courage was dripping away. . . . suppose they were scandinavians?

--what nonsense! . . . per hansa kept right on walking. neither swedes nor danes behaved in that boorish fashion; anyway, they probably had all gone to bed at hans olsa's; they always turned in early there.

the fire burned lustily over on the prairie; four women went to and fro placing dishes of food on a big green cloth spread on the ground; some of the men had already gathered around it; others were occupied with the wagons. . . . as they drew near, per hansa counted ten men in all; he scrutinized their faces closely, one b

y one; but he found none that he liked. . . . tönseten went briskly up to the fire and greeted those who were sitting around; per hansa did likewise. the strangers plainly sneered at their greeting; they said something among themselves which per hansa did not understand. . . .

--where did these men come from? tönseten asked, boldly.

--from down in iowa.

--were they going far west?

--no!

this much per hansa was able to follow; but here he began to lose the meaning; the men spoke english too fast, and tönseten wasn't much better; not that it made any difference, however; per hansa knew all that he needed to know. . . . they had come at last! . . . of the conversation that followed he only understood that it was about land and that the men were making sport with tönseten, who had grown angry and now spoke still faster. . . . it was unbelievable how fast syvert could rattle off the english! . . . t

 tell it by the sound of their laughter. . . . damn it all, to think that he couldn't talk to them!

"huh!" exclaimed tönseten, turning suddenly to his neighbour . . . "can you imagine what they are saying? . . . they . . . they insist that both my quarter and hans olsa's belong to them!"

"you don't say! . . . what about mine?"

but tönseten paid no further attention to him; he was off again in his squabble with the irishmen, and growing more and more excited with every word. . . . it struck per hansa that if syvert didn't stop a moment to catch his breath, he was either going to explode, or else he would burst into tears; he grasped his arm firmly.

"what do they say, syvert?"

"they say they've taken up all the land between the creek and the swamps over to the westward, a strip two quarter-sections wide. . . . and they talk rougher and wilder than anything i ever heard; they're threatening murder, and fire, and state's prison!"

"do they say when they were here?"

"last summer, and late in

 the fall, and early this spring, too!"

"what cultivation have they done to meet the law?" . . . per hansa spoke calmly and thoughtfully.

"they claim that they've been granted exemption from the government because they were soldiers in the civil war! . . . isn't that the devil's own luck?"

"ask to see their papers."

"they say they've got the papers. they'll produce them in the morning, all right!"

"then we might as well go home and get to bed!" said per hansa, calmly. . . . "but be sure to ask whether they need any potatoes!" he added with a flash of roguishness.

but tönseten had not heard; he was once more absorbed in wrangling. the men about the fire had now all risen; those who were working at the wagons had joined them; a close circle had formed around the pair. per hansa watched in silence, his pipe hanging unlighted from one corner of his mouth; when his eyes caught those of one of the strangers he held on some time before letting go.

"well

," he put in, dryly, as tönseten stopped to catch his breath, "don't they want to buy any potatoes?" . . .

"potatoes!" cried tönseten. . . . "you ought to hear how savagely they talk! they say they don't need to show any papers to thieves and claim jumpers like us!"

"all right. . . . have they got their stakes down here, too?"

"on both quarters, they say!"

per hansa saw that if tönseten kept on much longer, he would go to pieces entirely; that would be rather embarrassing for both of them.

"come on, syvert, let's go home to bed. . . . it looks as though we couldn't make a deal in potatoes, anyway!"

at that he calmly began to elbow his way out of the circle; tönseten saw him going, grew alarmed, and hurried after. some one of the irish must have tripped him; he stumbled and nearly lost his balance; this made them all laugh--but one man in particular roa

red with glee; his jeering voice had an offensive, deliberately insulting tone.

. . . per hansa wheeled suddenly and stood glaring at them; tönseten glanced at him and grew frightened in earnest.

. . . "come on!" he cried with chattering teeth, and took to his heels.

. . . "hell, syvert--wait a minute!"

per hansa kept searching the crowd until he found the face from which that insolent jeering came; a grim, cold sneer had spread over his own. at last he located the fellow, close at hand; he held his clenched fist under the man's nose, drew his head well down between his shoulders in order to get more power, and said in a dry, rasping voice, in the broadest nordland dialect:

"now, by god! you'd better shut up your mouth or i'll wipe that grin off your face for you!"

his eyes actually seemed to scorch t

he man; then he let up, straightened his shoulders, and glanced around at the crowd.

. . . apparently no one was anxious to have anything to do with him; the jeering laughter died away. then he let his gaze travel slowly back to the first man; the fellow had sense enough not to laugh any more. . . . and so, since he couldn't talk to them, there was nothing left for per hansa to do but go away. . . .

off in the dark he could hear a faint calling; by the sound of tönseten's voice he was not far from tears now.

"i'll take all our papers along to-morrow and show them--they'll see what's what!" he blubbered, as per hansa came up. . . . "you shouldn't be so hasty! suppose they had all fallen upon us! . . . good heavens! . . ."

"well, you can try your papers on them, if you want to. . . . but let me tell you this, my good syvert: with these people you can't use either

 the 'catechism' or the 'epitome'; they don't live according to the scriptures!" . . .

tönseten drew a long and heavy sigh. . . . "my god! what troubles a man may fall into! . . . it makes me shudder to think how wild they talked!"

when they parted it was agreed that all the menfolk should meet early next morning, to counsel together as to what must be done. per hansa was to notify hans olsa and the solum boys, and bring all three over to tonseten's.

"don't breathe a word to kjersti about how things are!" per hansa warned him. . . . "if the women ever get hold of this, they'll die of fright! . . . we'll find a way out somehow--i tell you we will!"

as he walked homeward per hansa was a totally different man from the one who had gone over to tönseten's a couple of hours before. then he had carried a heavy burden of worry and care; but now he wal

 . . . his banter grew so boisterous at last that beret was half-frightened; but his voice sounded so bright and cheerful, and had such a warm, infectious gladness running through it, that she could not find it in her heart to reprove him. when they went to bed later in the evening he put his arm lovingly around her and fell asleep almost immediately. . . . she felt sure there could be no danger this time.

but before she was awake, and long before the faintest light of day shone into the room, per hansa was up again; he ate some cold porridge left from the night before, put the deed into his pocket, and went over to the solum boys' place; there he roused them, and waited till they had eaten a mouthful or two; then all three continued on to hans olsa's.

as they walked along per hansa reviewed the situation for them; with the help of their questions, he gradually explained his plan:

"it's this way, boys: there's no danger for any of us three; our neighbours are the ones who are in trouble and

lain english, that here we are, and here we intend to stay until some one kicks us out. . . . put all the guts into it that you can!"

the solum boys took a sensible view of the whole matter; to henry it seemed just an amusing interruption to their loneliness; the idea of chasing people away from a place that was nearly destitute of human beings already, seemed comical. . . . even sam was brave to-day; these were white folks, with whom one could talk and reason; that wasn't so dangerous! . . .

per hansa told them to keep on to tönseten's; he and hans olsa would come as soon as they could.

everything about hans olsa was of unusual dimensions; his great body made strangers stop and look; it loomed up like a mountain when he rose to his full height; his strength was in proportion to his bulk; things that he took hold of often got crushed in his grip. new ideas found their way behind that big forehead with great difficulty; he had to look at a thought for some time before he could comp

 in there, it would remain clear and unchanged forever. his mind worked in the same way as his body; he was slow to grasp, but rarely dropped anything after he had picked it up; on this account he always found it difficult to turn back, once he had chosen his path. right and wrong were eternal verities with him, which could not be changed and must not be tampered with; right was right, and wrong was wrong; thus it had always been, and thus it must remain as long as the world should stand.

when per hansa entered his neighbour's house that morning, he found himself immediately embarrassed; both husband and wife were up, and he did not care to speak of their predicament while sörine was listening; the women ought to be kept out of this! time was pressing, however, and he couldn't waste it in lengthy explanations; besides, hans olsa and his wife had already discovered the camp to the westward and were planning to go over and visit the strangers, with tönseten as an interpreter. . . . per hansa h

mself had gone to the land office in person; tönseten had put his finger on precisely this quarter-section on the map, and had asked in hans olsa's name if it could be taken up; there had been nothing in the way, not the slightest claim; it was so stated in the document; and he had moved directly on to his land and had done everything that the law prescribed. if anything was wrong, the government would have to clear it up; but how could anything possibly be wrong? . . .

"why, certainly," said per hansa, with shrewd common sense. . . . "the government is all right in its place--no one questions that! but out here this morning, the government is a little too far away . . . that's where the trouble comes in."

"you don't mean that they actually intend to kick us out?" demanded hans olsa in an astonished voice, unconsciously stretching his huge frame.

"that's just what they intend to do, as i understand them. . . . we'll have to show them where we stand, in black and white!" . . . per hansa look

ed at the woman.

"you don't say, per hansa! are there . . . are there many of them?"

"i counted ten men and four women; i believe that's all there are." . . . the ghost of a smile passed over per hansa's face.

hans olsa sat in silence for a while, with the deed folded up in his hand: then he smoothed it out again and looked at it closely. the greater part of it was unintelligible to him, but he understood all the essentials: the date, the description of the land, the signature of the government, and his own. all this was correct in every way; and up to this very minute he had kept his part of the contract to the letter of the law. he handed the paper to per hansa, and said in a ponderous voi

ce:

"do you see anything wrong there?"

per hansa was growing impatient; here they sat, wasting precious time; his laugh had a hard, short ring:

"no! it isn't you who are wrong in this case, you see; it's those devils who have squatted here on your land!"

"do they look like peaceable folks?" asked sörine, calmly.

"one would suppose so . . . they have their women along!"

hans olsa spoke slowly: "we'd better go over and talk to them."

"that's the idea! . . . just put the deed in your pocket, and let's get started!"

the solum boys were waiting impatiently when the others arrived. later on, tönseten let it out that he had told his wife the whole story as soon as he had come home the night before; neither of them had slept a wink all night. he was nervous and jumpy this morning, and wanted to start out immediately.

"no, this won't do," said per hansa, firmly. "we mustn't go without a plan. how are we going to tackle the business when we get there?"

"we've got to drive them away from here!" cried tönseten, excitedly.

"fine! . . . but the question is: how are we going about it?"

"we've got to convince them that we are here with the full sanction of law and justice," said hans olsa, solemnly.

"you're damned right we must!" flashed per hansa. . . . "have you got your paper, syvert?"

--no, tönseten had thought of bringing the deed with hi

m, but he feared it would be too risky. . . . "they might take it away from me, and then i'd be in a devil of a hole!" tönseten's face was so agitated that it was a pity to look at.

but per hansa now took charge in a determined manner. . . . "go in and get that deed immediately, syvert, so that we can get going! . . . don't worry--we'll see to it that no one molests you!"

and so they started. on the way over, per hansa explained the tactics they were to follow; henry solum and tönseten should be the spokesmen, sam the interpreter; per hansa took pains to impress upon sam how important it was that he translate correctly and rapidly, so that he and hans olsa could keep abreast of proceedings. . . . "i think it will be best for you, henry, to cut loose; then you, syvert, can put in your oar when you think it's needed. but don't say much; and for heaven's sake, be careful not to talk too fast; you know how quick

ly you get short-winded. remember we have the whole day ahead of us!"

tönseten was highly displeased with this plan of per hansa's, but he lacked the strength to protest; matters had reached such a bad pass already that they could hardly get worse. . . .

it was plainly evident that the strangers had not overslept themselves that morning; although the hour was still very early--full daylight had barely come--all hands were busily at work when the five settlers reached the camp. two of the wagons had already been unloaded; a few of the men were beginning to open up the others, while the rest of the crew were putting up a

large tent.

per hansa and henry solum walked ahead; then came hans olsa and sam; tönseten, who at first had trotted along with the van, had now quietly dropped back to the rear.

"ah-ha!" observed per hansa to his companions. "they're planning to settle here, it seems! . . . now, first you must ask to see their papers; and then the stakes--insist on the stakes! talk pleasantly to begin with . . . but it won't do any harm to have a little sport with them, you know. if they get ugly, just tease them on awhile."

their friendly greetings were returned in a churlish fashion; the strangers didn't seem anxious for company; each man went about his task without paying the slightest attention to the visito

greeted this sally; but the man who had spoken wasn't exactly laughing--he held his head tilted on one side, his whole face screwed into an ugly leer. . . . sam translated as accurately as he could.

--yes, henry continued in a firmer and more imperative tone, they had come to see both their papers and their stakes! furthermore, there was a court in sioux falls to settle such matters. they had been living here all summer, breaking and planting, and hadn't the least thought of moving away. . . . per hansa sensed by the tone of henry's voice that he was speaking well. "that's right, henry. . . . give 'em hell!" the man who had spoken with such an evil look a moment before, now threw down his sledge hammer and came up to them.

--all right, boys! since they wouldn't take his word for it, he'd soon show them in black and white! the papers had been packed away somewhere and couldn't be found just now. they would have to wait awhile to look at them; but he would show them the stakes! they'd better co

me right along with him now; he was in a devil of a hurry; he had both plowing and building to do before the snow flew.

the stranger began to walk rapidly westward; per hansa was right at his heels; as they hurried on, he breathed a prayer that the grass might have sprung up freshly where he had done that little piece of work! . . .

the man seemed very certain about his direction. as they approached hans olsa's southwest corner, he slackened his pace and began pushing the grass aside with his foot; per hansa had in the meanwhile discovered with his eyes the exact spot where the stake had stood. he all but laughed aloud; indeed, the rain and the sun of the good lord

e their work well; not a blade of grass seemed displaced, not a broken stalk could be seen! . . . besides, the man was mistaken about the location of the spot; he had gone too far to the north and west before he got down on his knees to scan the ground. he did a thorough job, however; walked a few steps, knelt and examined the ground round about; rose, went forward a little distance, got down on his knees again; but all the while he was moving farther and farther away from the right spot. . . . per hansa could hardly restrain himself; quiet chuckles were beginning to rise in his throat; but he realized the danger in time, and coughed them away.

the man searched and searched, back and forth, around and around; at first he went at it hastily, as if finding that stake were the easiest thing in the world; after a while he looked more slowly and cautiously. . . . he was swearing like a trooper now; per hansa knew enough english to understand most of it; he didn't wonder that the fellow felt moved t

 complimentary remarks about him; and it all seemed to awaken a new and ominous force behind that impassive countenance; his big childlike eyes blazed with astonishment, occasionally emitting sharp flashes; he trembled slightly all over, though he was not aware of it.

suddenly the two men abandoned the search, exchanged a few heated remarks, turned away, and went back to the camp without saying another word. . . . the five settlers followed.

"if they have no better luck with the papers," said per hansa, "things don't look very bright for them!"

when the five reached the camp all ten of the strangers stood in a group, talking angrily together. the women were nowhere in sight; as the nordlanders came up a burly, red-faced man stepped out from the group, evidently their leader. . . .

an carried a sledge hammer in his hand also attracted per hansa's attention.

"where are the men who claim to have taken up this land?" he snapped at them.

--right there, those two!--henry pointed to tönseten and hans olsa.--that one--tönseten--owned the quarter to the south; this one--hans olsa--the one they now stood on.

the irishman singled out hans olsa and looked him up and down.

--what was the matter with that fellow--was he deaf and dumb? he couldn't seem to get his mouth open! the man fingered his sledge hammer, and glared around at henry as if

sam was translating all this as best he could.

--well, he could tell this dirty son-of-a- ---- that he was a thief and a blackguard who had destroyed another man's landmarks!

sam translated rapidly, trembling with fear.

the irishman came closer.

--if the whole damned gang of sneaking swine didn't get off their land right away, he'd give them something to start with!--perhaps they'd understand that language better!--the man swung his sledge hammer.

"look out, now!" shouted per hansa. "here the trouble starts!" . . .

and so it did, only much faster than he or any of the others had anticipated. when hans olsa saw the irishman loom up before him in that threatening attitude, he stared at him blankly, and stood for a moment as if rooted to the ground. then, all of a sudden, the upper part of his body seemed to stretch; he stepped aside to evade the onslaught . . . his left fist shot out and struck the man below the ear. there was a crashing sound; with a loud groan the man sa

"look out there, henry!" cried per hansa. . . . "see that you get your man, and i'll get mine! . . . wait a minute!"

the crowd had drawn back in front of one of the empty wagons; they stood as if dazed. hans olsa stared at them wildly, took a step forward, and stumbled over the heap on the ground. regaining his balance, he stopped, bent over, and plunged both hands into the inert heap of flesh; the next instant he lifted it high in the air and flung it bodily over the heads of the crowd, where it crashed into the wagon standing behin

hans olsa stood motionless, quivering in every muscle; he seemed like a man half stunned.

per hansa jumped to his side and slapped him on the shoulder:

"goodness! hans olsa, that was beautiful! i don't believe there's another man in the whole country who could do such a thing! . . . now i think we can safely go home; those folks aren't likely to start any more arguments about land!"

hans olsa was slowly regaining his natural poise; he stroked his face and sighed deeply, like one recovering from an attack of delirium.

"i'm afraid i handled him pretty roughly; you'd better go and look at him

per hansa laughed confidently. . . . "no, leave him alone; just do as i say, now! we're going straight home, the whole lot of us. . . . later in the day i'll take a little trip of my own out westward!"

they did as he bade them--though tönseten could not be found anywhere; he had vanished from the scene long before. in the latter part of the afternoon per hansa returned to the camp of the irish, to find out what they were doing and how they were getting along; he took store-hans with him as interpreter. . . . he found the whole camp moved to one of the two quarter-sections lying west of tönseten's and hans olsa's land.

per hansa made frequent visits to them during the next few days; before the third day was over, he had sold them more than ten dollars' worth of potatoes; he felt that he had struck up a profitable business.

it was lonesome after the men had left that morning; kjersti kept the coffeepot on the stove, and laid on a couple of fresh sticks of wood; he would be sure to look in for a drop when he came back! . . . then she put on syvert's old hat and went over to see beret; she wanted to find out what per hansa had told her when he came home the night before.

she got little information or comfort there, however. . . . first she recounted most of what tönseten had let out to her--that people had arrived who claimed to own hans olsa's land, as well as his own; that these people wouldn't listen to reason, so in all probability they would have to seek the aid of the law. . . . hadn't per hansa told her what had happened?

the boys were eating their breakfast; beret sat over by the stove, dressing the ch

said, she thought, that the seed which is sown in secret bears fruit openly! . . . with the child in her arms, she got up decisively, crossed the room, and flashed out at the boys; she was very stern now, and scolded them harshly.

all the while kjersti had been growing more disturbed; she had to find consolation somewhere, and said, as if trying to bolster herself up:

"this can't be anything to worry about! why, we have been given this quarter, and were the first to arrive here!"

"what about per hansa's land?" asked beret.

"it seems they don't intend to claim that, according to what syvert says. . . . i don't know why!"

"probably nothing can be done about it," said beret, quietly. "there is no telling who may have been wandering around out here before we came. . . . many may have been here."

this aimless talk only irritated kjersti.

"i should think they would keep all that straightened out--the people whose business it is to look after such things! if syvert weren't such a milksop of a m

 he had to confide in some one, or he would burst; so he finally told her his version of everything that had taken place that morning. some of the things he had seen; the rest were phantoms of his own terror; he enlarged on certain points in his narrative very fully--especially the awful language which the irish had used, and the effective replies which he had made to them. the general impression given by his story was that in all probability he would have brought the irish around all right, if per hansa and henry solum hadn't stirred them up to fight; they had done just exactly the wrong things. and so a big ruffian had rushed forward with a sledge hammer; and hans olsa had gone into a mad rage and killed the man! from now on there would be nothing but war and bloodshed; so they might as well pack up and move right away! what a tragedy it was! . . .

tönseten stayed safely in bed until late in the afternoon; then kjersti came and told him that the strangers had gone. he got up immediately to

ken, thinking that it would be an easy matter, since they were the stronger, then her own husband had used deceit and force to drive them away; and now all was well! . . .

what would become of children who had to grow up in such an atmosphere? . . . their own children! . . . she listened to her boys gloating over the incidents of the recent encounter--and her soul shuddered.

. . . no, she knew one who could not endure it forever out here!

one afternoon a few days later the irish came over to per hansa's to buy more potatoes; they stayed for some time and asked for information on various matters; the boys translated the questions to their father as well as they could; per hansa thought the irish were excellent folk!

at both tönseten's and hans olsa's they had noticed the strangers come and go; in the evening they all went to per hansa's to learn how the irish had behaved.

. . . "finest people in the world!" per hansa assured them, pacing the floor, uplifted by a surge of high spirits that

somehow had to find an outlet. no sooner did he sit down than he was up again; his sallies of humour had a dashing quality that made them positively contagious. tönseten was in a continual gale of hilarity; kjersti and sörine, who sat on the big bed with their knitting, had to let their work drop at intervals to laugh at syvert's and per hansa's extravagances. beret had just laid the child in the other bed, and was sitting beside her on the edge; both boys were listening eagerly to the talk of their elders.

that evening per hansa told them all about the stakes; of how he had found them, of what he had thought, and of the way he had finally disposed of them. he related the story in a loud voice, with boisterous, care-free zest; he made it sound exactly like a fairy tale. . . . many words of praise were bestowed on his wise action; t

s for kjersti, she was moved almost to tears over such a man. what a difference from that spineless jellyfish of a husband of hers!

"i'll have to admit," said hans olsa, soberly, "that you played a risky game; and it was the hand of the lord that kept you from telling. for if they had been able to show that their stakes had ever been on my land, we'd probably be building a new house now, somewhere out to the westward. all our work this summer would have been for others. . . . my thanks to you, per hansa!"

as beret listened to the tale, she had to examine the narrator closely; surely this couldn't be per hansa! she remembered the morning when he had brought the stakes home; how he had chopped them up and put them furtively into the stove; and how his temper had taken hold of him at that time. . . . this was an entirely different person!

. . . so it had come to this, that he no longer felt ashamed of his sinful deed . . . and that respectable folks sat around, rejoicing with him over it! . . .

 she got up quickly, overcome by a sudden feeling of suffocation; involuntarily, without stopping to think, she said in a level, biting tone:

"where i come from, it was always considered a shameful sin to destroy another man's landmarks. . . . but here, i see, people are proud of such doings!"

her outburst shocked the others into silence--all but per hansa. with a loud laugh he reached out clownishly, trying to catch her in his arms.

"oh, beret, come on, now! . . . just kick the dog that bites you--that's always the easiest way out, and the simplest, too!"

"i understand that perfectly well--though it makes poor christianity. . . . but you were anything but confident, i noticed, that night when you stood over by the block, chopping up the stakes." she turned away from him and seemed to speak to them all. . . . "remember what the book says: 'curs

ed be he that removeth his neighbour's landmarks! and all the people shall say, amen.' . . . words like these we used to heed. . . . in my opinion, we'd better take care lest we all turn into beasts and savages out here!" . . .

per hansa laughed again with unnecessary loudness; but in the midst of the laugh he stopped, a wave of anger suddenly surging over him:

"we need a preacher, i hear. . . . well, now we've got one!"

to this beret made no reply; instead, she left the room abruptly. outside, it was pitch dark; she knew not where to turn nor what she did; then she stumbled over the plow standing in the yard, and sank inertly on the plow beam. . . . as she sat there the storm within her slowly died away; deep melancholy came

 instead. . . . long after the others had gone she remained in the same position. per hansa had not come out to look for her. . . . when she went in at last he had gone to bed; she could not make out if he was sleeping, but she did not speak to him. the boys also had gone to bed. . . .

during the days that followed, words were few and distant between per hansa and his wife.

facing the great desolation

in the beginning of october a memorable event stirred the little spring creek settlement. this, the greatest happening of the year, chose an opportune moment for its arrival.

it was shortly after dinner. in the early morning per hansa, hans olsa, and henry solum had gone east to the sioux river after wood; tönseten was so sorely troubled by rheumatism that he hadn't been able to go along; anyway, he had wood enough on hand to last

rest seeking shelter in the barn.

tönseten didn't get much rest that night; the worst of it was that he couldn't talk to kjersti, at a time when he so sorely needed her counsel. . . . good god! how could he sleep, with this tremendous responsibility suddenly thrust upon him? a whole settlement of norwegians snoring right in front of his bed! . . . fine people, excellent people, every one! and there would be still more in the company when they moved west next spring. . . . hang the luck!--that per hansa should be far away on the sioux river at this important moment! . . . if he could only persuade them to settle here, the future would be secure for both himself and his neighbours. . . . yes, let him bring that about, and things would look so bright that he could turn over in bed and drop asleep every night with a thankful heart!

. . . he ought to start out right now, and get per hansa, who had such a wonderfully persuasive gift of tongue. but he couldn't discuss it with kjersti; neither could

to trust it too far. . . . when the strangers hitched up their horses and crossed the creek--they had decided to settle on the east side, with a chance to expand southward--he felt obliged to go along with them; but after night had fallen and they had pitched their tents, and he was forced to leave them--then he was full of alarms.

. . . many things might happen during the night!

they would soon have to make another trip to town. beret looked forward to it with dread; it meant that per hansa would be gone for a whole week's time. the evenings were long and the nights hung heavy over the hut; she had to struggle with so many fearful fancies--fancies that multiplied as time went on; though she felt unable to speak to him about it--though he would be unable to help her if she did--yet it was a great relief to have him near, for then it seemed as if the horror dared not touch her. she dreaded each occasion which took him away from home, even if it was only for half a day's work with on

e of the neighbours. . . . and now he would be gone for a whole week's time!

. . . she realized, too, that they would have to have provisions for the winter; the children were sadly in need of clothes, and per hansa himself needed many things. but in her condition, these material affairs became more and more unreal to her; it seemed as if she stood apart from them--they did not concern her. . . . all this she kept to herself, however; ah, what was the use of speaking where no one could hear! . . . she helped him get ready for the journey as if nothing were wrong; whenever he begged to know what he could buy for her and for the house, she would stop to ponder the question with a distant look in her eyes, as

 if trying to think of many things which she couldn't for the moment remember. at that he would joke her, saying she mustn't be backward about it, for now they had plenty of money; what was she standing there thinking of? . . . to this question he either would receive no answer at all, or else he would hear her repeat what she had just been saying; or perhaps she would make some absent-minded, irrelevant remark, as if she had not heard him. . . . at such times per hansa would look at his wife and sigh; then he would take hold of her and swing her around, trying to cheer her. . . .

but beyond that he was too busy to pay much attention to her. on this trip to town he was going himself; tönseten had offered to lend him his horses and wagon, and had promised to stay home and look after things. the sognings and vossings were still here; they needed advice and help in so many ways; and he, tönseten, was just the man for that; he held himself like a father to them
 
 ___________________________
 
--yes, like providence itself! . . . per hansa had a lot of plans to make before starring out; he wasn't so short of money now; the irish were fond of potatoes and had been good customers; as for the sognings, they seemed even fonder of potatoes than the irish; he had managed to sell them more than ten dollars' worth; however it had happened, his cash supply was a good deal larger to-day than when he had first arrived in the early summer.

on the other hand, there was no end to all the things he needed; he had jotted down a long list of art

o wasn't mentioned in the bible story!

. . . oh yes . . . of course he would take care of mother!

but, here was another thing: couldn't father get hold of a shotgun when he went to town? the last time store-hans had been to the swamps the ducks had been thicker than ever. . . . and the irish had settled awfully close to them!

. . . well, the father didn't know; he would see what he could do; he had thought of another way to catch those ducks, but what it was he wouldn't let out now.

indeed, per hansa's mind was full of busy thoughts. . . . in the cellar were many more potatoes than they could consume during the winter or use as seed next spring; and now he was going to town with horses and wagon; it would be strange enough if he couldn't find people who needed food. alas! however, it was now already the twelfth of october; some nights it froze--and potatoes were sensitive to cold! but ever since the world was made the people of nordland had known how to bring potatoes safely all the way up

to lofoten, even in the middle of january. . . . it could certainly be done again, with a little care!

per hansa pondered, looked at the weather, sniffed and tried the air. on the afternoon before their departure he came to a decision: there were more potatoes than they could use; if they froze, they froze. yes, sir! he would give it a try! and so he went over to tönseten's and brought the wagon; he padded it thickly, bottom and sides, with soft hay; then he loaded it with potatoes in bulk. on top of the load he placed two sacks of rutabagas, and one of carrots; finally he picked out some of the nicest m

early the next morning they started off; henry solum and hans olsa went with him.

the wagons drifted slowly through the outspread day, creeping on through indolent, drowsy fall sunshine and blue-green haze, toward a distant sky line from which hung a quivering yellow veil. for all they drove, the sky line came no closer; but when the purple shadows of evening fell, there seemed to be a chance, at least, that they might reach it.

this was a great day for per hansa. now he was travelling the very trail he should have followed on his way out last summer; but in one day's march he traversed a stretch that then took him four times as long. . . . all day the landscape was the same, yet its details seemed ever changing and ever new; prairies that extended to the end of the world; prairies that billowed into slopes, rose in low hills, then flattened out again and sank away into an endless plain.

the caravan headed for the sky; it steered straight onward. now,

at last, per hansa had time to look about him and rejoice in what he saw. . . . and all he saw was beautiful! even the others, who had gone this way before, found many strange new things to look at, the farther they advanced into the bluish-yellow haze. . . . here and there a sod hut peeped up from the ground, where last summer there was nothing but gopher hills.

their goal that first day's journey was split rock creek, where they intended to camp for the night. they took turns with three teams at hauling per ha

nsa's load, in order to ease up on his horses and so make faster progress; thirty-eight miles they had come that day when they finally reached split rock creek, on the other side of the sioux river; there they found a ford over the creek, and pitched their camp on the eastern shore. . . . when they had been crossing the sioux river earlier in the day--it seemed an almost unbelievably long while ago--they had stopped long enough to catch three big pickerel. now per hansa slung a kettle over the fire and cooked the fresh fish for supper, he buried some potatoes in the ashes next to the kettle. soon they were all seated on the bank, partaking of a lordly feast for them, even though it was only of fish and potatoes. . . . the water purled by below, murmuring gently, reminding them of much that was dear and half forgotten. . . . conversation flowed freely while they ate, but after they had finished it began to lull away. they laid more wood on the fire and got out

mlessly until the day began once more to gild the blue wall of the east. the coffee was boiled; enough cold fish and potatoes were left from supper to make a meal; very soon each one was seated in his wagon again, jogging still farther away from a place they knew . . . a place they seemed to remember . . . a place far off under the western skies, where a group of sod huts ought to be lying! . . . wasn't there such a place out there somewhere? but it seemed strangely vague and distant now! . . . per hansa braced up in his seat, put his mind intently on beret and store-hans--and then the sod huts stood out more vividly. . . .

. . . poor beret-girl! if only she wouldn't be too lonesome while he was away!

this day's journey also turned out to be full of interesting things. as they went along, sod huts stood here and there moping dejectedly, where, according to hans olsa and the solum boy, no house should have been. . . . good heavens! where had they all come from? settlers must be swarming out of

e hard at work, breaking prairie; here, too, the sod must be tough of fibre, for the job didn't seem to be going very fast. what first arrested the eyes of the travellers was the team that pulled the plow; an ox with shining brass sockets on the ends of his huge horns had been yoked together with a skinny poll-cow. the woman walked alongside the team, driving; the man, whose patriarchal beard swept his chest, steered the plow, pushing from behind with all his might.

these folks were hallings;1 per hansa and hans olsa were very glad to hear it. a halling is usually easy of approach; they at once struck up a conversation with these people. . . . only another incredible fairy tale! with nothing but this team, the man related, he had brought his family and all his earthly possessions the whole distance from iowa, a matter of over four-hundred miles--"a long, laborious journey," as he quaintly expressed it.

--they surely hadn't made the whole trip with t

hose horses? asked per hansa.

--why, certainly they had! . . . the halling laughed.

--how long had it taken?

--oh, not so very long--seven weeks and two days, to be exact. they hadn't been able to hurry, because of the cow; she was the one who supplied most of their food, and so they had to be reasonable with her.

"do tell me!" said per hansa, flabbergasted. "you don't mean to say that she's milking, that cow of yours?"

"certainly she's milking! . . . that is, when we don't drive her too hard."

"by god! that must be a wonderful cow! . . . but say, now: don't you need some potatoes with the milk? i've got a whole load of 'em here that i'm trying to sell."

the halling looked at him, his jaw dropping, and evidently wanted to say something; but no sound came. a force was working there under the long beard which gave his whole face a

comical expression; it seemed for a moment as if the man might be chuckling; but when per hansa looked at him more closely, he discovered a film of moisture in the man's blinking eyes.

. . . "potatoes, you say? . . . well, now!" . . .

the man wiped his eyes and regarded per hansa dumbly. his wife stood beside him; her face was long and drawn. . . . suddenly she wept. . . .

"have you got any food in the house?" demanded per hansa.

"er--yes . . . as long as the cow gives milk!" . . . it was the woman who supplied this information.

then per hansa burst out laughing. . . . "listen here, woman--you run in after a pail, and we'll treat you to a decent meal . . . since we're the visitors!"

and this is sure: it didn't take the woman long to produce the pail! per hansa grabbed it from her, filled it with potatoes, and gave her a quick look--then looked again; at that, he poured the potatoes out on the ground, filled the meas

ure once more, and gave her a second pailful.

. . . "there you are--one for each of you; don't kill yourselves eating, now!"

the man gazed at per hansa, blinked his eyes, coughed emphatically, and said: "so far, so good. . . . but give me four more pailfuls, and i'll pay you a whole dollar when i get the money; you'll probably be passing here again. . . . if you should happen to die before that time, the potatoes wouldn't do you any good."

"no, but i might need the dollar!" laughed per hansa. "but never mind--thanks for your offer, just the same! . . . what do you say to eight pailfuls and two dollars--when you get the money?"

then the halling laughed so that his big beard shook. . . . "listen here, man; why not sixteen pailfuls and four dollars? you'll get your money sometime. . . . to tell the truth, there's very little to eat in our house." . . .

the woman had already taken one pailful inside; now she was down on her knees, gathering the loose potatoes in her skirt; she worked

 with feverish haste, using both her hands, and eying per hansa askance from time to time.

per hansa laughed good-naturedly at the halling. . . . "now i'll just tell you how we'll do this: you have enough here for the time being; you can wait till i get back home--and then i'll bring you a whole load. . . . you need food, man! . . . i'll take the money when i get it."

so the agreement was made; before they went on, however, per hansa gave them one of the left-over fishes, half a pailful of carrots from the sack; and the nicest melon he could find on the load. . . . "don't kill yourselves eating, now!" were his parting words to the hallings.

. . . again he sat on the wagon, creaking along toward a yellowish-blue horizon; he couldn't remember when life had been so much fun!

around noon of the day after their visit with the hallings, the three wagons entered worthington. there was nothing much of an urban air about

, the town consisted merely of a couple of dozen houses scattered all about, some just rough shanties, others only sod huts; all bore the earmarks of having been hurriedly constructed, and intended only for temporary shelter. the place had much the appearance of a camp, that to-day would be here, but to-morrow might have moved miles away. however, it contained a couple of stores; and most important item of all--the railroad, the main artery of life in this far region, had made its way thither.

per hansa drove from house to house, greeting the people with a cheerful grin and asking in his broadest nordland dialect if they didn't want any potatoes; he said nothing of the other wares which he had brought. luck wasn't sitting in every doorway waiting for him, however; the peddling proved to be a slow business. not until he reached a sod hut at the other end of the town did he make a bargain worth mentioning; here he happened on a widow with two half-grown boys; the widow was danish and ran a small

 poultry farm.

. . . yes, indeed, she needed potatoes, for both herself and the boys, and for the birds as well; she hadn't any money in the house, but she had the chickens. . . . wouldn't he trade some potatoes for a fowl or two?

--of course he would! per hansa was more than willing; after dickering awhile, he bartered nine pails of potatoes for three young chickens.

--this is a mighty profitable deal!--he thought--the hallings are good people, but the danes are even better. . . . "listen, mother, perhaps you'd just as soon take three pailfuls more and give me the fourth hen?" . . . the widow agreed to that at once and per hansa felt that now he had made a fine bargain indeed.

the widow, too, seemed very well satisfied; they beamed in mutual gratitu

. . . per hansa started to leave. but the widow wouldn't hear of such a thing; of course he mustn't leave yet awhile! she had an old rooster cooking on the stove; it had been boiling since early in the forenoon and ought to be tender pretty soon; he must unhitch his horses and tie them to the wagon, and then come inside; where there was enough for three, there would always be something left over for a fourth. . . . now he must go and do as she said, and then come right in! . . . per hansa wasn't refusing!

 face of the room in which he now found himself was even more attractive; it seemed that he had never seen anything so cozy as this room! it was only a sod hut, smaller than his own, with three tiny chambers; but a homely feeling pervaded every nook and corner of it. but best of all, the walls were not a dirty black like those in his house; they were a dazzling white--a white so pure and gleaming that it caught up and reflected the gold of the sun! . . . a real fairy house, that's what it was!

per hansa looked and looked--and forgot to sit down.

. . . "no, never mind the food, mother," he said. "i'd rather you would tell me how you've gone about it to make things so extra fine in here! is this paint, i'd like to know? . . . it must be terribly expensive!" . . . his face showed nothing but sheer good nature and open admiration as he stood there looking into her eyes; she gave him a merry laugh, as though she had known him for many a year.

the widow gave him all the desired information while she prepared the meal; she rattled on in a steady stream as she went about her work. he needn't worry about remembering the name; there was a norwegian lumberman in town who sold the stuff; perhaps he might be able to barter potatoes for it! . . . thus and thus he must mix it.

"you're crazy, mother!" interrupted per hansa; he stood in the middle of the floor, overcome by a wild impulse to hug the cheery widow. . . . "do you actually think he might take potatoes? i've got some carrots and melons, too! . . . i swear, mother, that if i had met you in time, i would have courted you!"

the man's happiness was so rollicking and genuine that the widow suddenly burst out laughing. . . . he might have done a worse thing than that for himself! she answered. no telling how that courting might have turned out! . . .

w dinner was ready. in came two little boys, with ruddy, beaming faces, just like their mother's; it seemed to per hansa as if he would never tire of looking at them; then he remembered the melons, and went out for the best one he could find; he brought it in and placed it on the floor. . . . he sat there eating the rooster with the widow and her boys--and it all seemed exactly like a fairy tale. as clear as daylight, luck was with him now! . . . before he took his leave, he gave the boys another melon, and half a pailful of carrots to the mother.

 luck followed per hansa that day. from the widow's he drove straight to the lumberman's, and asked if he would barter some building materials for a load of potatoes and other such delicacies; the man came over to look at his load. . . . yes, that wasn't at all impossible. what did he want, and how much of it, for his load?

per hansa gave a loud laugh at this question: "i really should have everything you've got in the place! . . . but i'll be reasonable and take a few sacks of lime and a few pieces of boards. you carry lime, don't you?"

the dicker finally resulted in per hansa's getting all the lime he needed, more lumber than he expected, and even some nails thrown into the bargain. the boards were planed smooth; per hansa handled them as if they had been the fine leaves of some costly book.

. . . "a dandy boat this is

going to make for the little fellow to rock in! . . . now he can come along any time!" . . . he turned to the lumberman: "next fall i'll show up here and buy out your whole shebang; i need all you've got, and lots more too, let me tell you!"

after that he had to chat a little while with this man; it seemed so pleasant to meet a norwegian here; per hansa felt as if a part of the town belonged to him. he found so many questions to ask, so many matters that he wanted to be posted on; the lumberman, who wasn't very busy just then, seemed more than willing to talk and to hear how things were getting on, out to the westward where they lived. per hansa sat chatting with him a long time.

in the meanwhile his companions had finished their trading and had eaten their dinner; when he finally drove up to the general store they were loading their wagons w

ith the merchandise they had bought. as soon as this was done all three entered the store again.

the moment he got in there among the many different kinds of merchandise, per hansa began to grow uneasy. pleasant odours from all the wares mingled in the air; a strong scent of whisky permeated the whole place; he went sniffing about and stamping on the floor, moving restlessly from one thing to another.

. . . "oh, the devil! if i wasn't so short of money! . . . but it won't do any harm to know where they keep things, when once we get the cash--eh, boys?"

before he started trading, per hansa had to make an agreement about the plow and the rake, which stood on the books aga

inst him; the solum boy acted as interpreter.

--he could pay the whole amount, of course?--the trader asked, as if taking it for granted.

--is the fellow plumb crazy! per hansa shouted.

--huh! how much could he pay, then?

"tell him fifteen dollars, henry--and that's the last cent, too!"

the trader's voice grew hard as he asked: was that all?

--yes, that was all!--said per hansa; a hard note had come into his voice, too.--he hadn't anything more, unless the fellow wanted to take his hide. but as for that--here he laughed and looked the man in the eye--the hide was so old and wrinkled that it wasn't good for much.

--we-ell--drawled the merchant--this was pretty poor business; but he would let it pass this time. he'd be ashamed to take such a weather-beaten hide. . . . did per hansa have anything at home?

--you bet he had!--laughed per hansa.--a wife and three youngste

rs, and one cow! . . . and something more coming! . . .

--huh!--said the other, his face hardening again.--he could keep his wife and youngsters; but the cow he would have to forfeit eventually, if he couldn't raise other means. . . . business was business!

the matter was finally arranged, however, in the way that per hansa wanted it; the balance of the amount should stand until next fall, at fifteen per cent interest.

then per hansa started to trade. the first thing he called for was net twine! . . . the solum boy and hans olsa burst out laughing; was he planning to knit a net out here on the open prairie? . . . never mind; he needed twine--twine first and foremost! when he finally had found a kind that he thought might do, he bought several balls; and then he called for rope--he had to have rope for the sheeting--how could he get along without that? . . . it seemed to his companions that he was wasting good money; it was

a long way to the sioux river and few trips could be made during the year! this they pointed out to him emphatically. but it did not affect him at all. . . . "just order that rope for me, henry!" commanded per hansa.

now the real provisioning, for which he had come all this distance, was ready to begin; he ordered a few trifles, in such a low, bashful voice, that henry had to ask him a second time before he understood; just some calico of a gaudy pattern, a few bits of ribbon and thread, and some soft, dainty white cotton goods. and, listen here--this was very important--some hoffman's drops, and a small bottle of sweet oil! . . . it was awfully awkward to have to use the solum boy as interpreter in such

matters--he was only a bachelor and had tried so few things in this world! per hansa managed to get what he wanted, however. . . . next, the real needs of the household had to be met; flour was the most important item, and came first on the list; then cloth, and tobacco, and matches, and kerosene; after that coffee, and molasses, and salt. this item of salt again threw his companions into consternation; per hansa ordered such an unreasonable quantity of it, and still he wondered if it wouldn't be too little! . . . lord! there was no limit to all the things per hansa thought he must have; but his money soon ran out and that put an end to the trading.

at last they were ready to leave.

"aren't we going to have a single drop on this trip?" hans olsa mused aloud.

"there you said something!" exclaimed per hansa. "that reminds me--i was to get three bottles for syvert! but not a word about it to kjersti--be

ar that in mind when we get home. . . . he's going to use it as liniment for his rheumatism, you know!"

the trader treated them all around before he filled the bottles. henry got two bottles for himself, and one for his brother; hans olsa had brought along his sunday bottle to be filled; as that would hardly be enough he bought a smaller one, which he put in his pocket; per hansa got two for himself, and three for tönseten. . . . when the trader had filled all their orders he felt that he had had such good business with these fellows that he could well afford to stand another round of treats--they seemed to be such decent folk, too! and before they left they felt obliged to follow the good old custom of sampling one another's bottles. good lord! it wasn't every day that they came to town. . . . hans olsa was stepping very cautiously when he climbed into his wagon; he p

lanked himself down upon the seat with slow and ponderous movements; but once down, there his big bulk sat secure.

it was late in the afternoon when they finally set out for home. ninety long miles lay ahead of them, but no one thought of that; they had plenty of food, the vaulted heavens for a roof wherever they chose to camp, and fair weather to send them on. . . .

per hansa drove in the van; he was continually clucking to his horses. his eyes were fixed on the western sky, already tinted by the strong glow of evening. . . . god! how beautiful these prairies were! . . . why couldn't they keep on driving all night long? . . .

when they at last pitched camp at the end of the day, and hans olsa had made the fire and hung the porridge pot over it, per hansa sat down by the firelight and began to whittle some shuttles for net knitting; he made two shuttles, and then a

his companions laughed at him and told him he must be crazy; first he had thrown away good money on a lot of twine, and now he was wasting his time over such nonsense!

. . . "never mind," said per hansa with his merry laugh. "one only talks according to his sense!" . . . he kept on working till he had finished the reel.

the days were long for the boys during their father's absence. ole soon tired of standing at the chopping block without the company of his brother, he idled aimlessly about, and made frequent errands into the house to see whether he couldn't hatch up something to break the monotony. store-hans wasn't much better off; the secret which his father had entrusted to him w

she had been lying awake a long time; sleep would not come. her thoughts drifted. . . .

. . . so it had come to this; they were no longer ashamed to eat troll food; they even sent it from house to house, as lordly fare!

all night long as she tossed in bed, bitter revolt raged within her. they should not stay here through the winter! . . . as soon as per hansa came home they must start on the journey back east; he, too, ought to be able to see by this time that they would all become wild beasts if they remained here much longer. everything human in them would gradually be blotted out. . . . they saw nothing, learned nothing. . . . it would be even worse for their children--and what of their children's children? . . . couldn't he understand that if the lord god had intended these infinities to be peopled, he would not have left them desolate down thro

the greatest difficulty would be to obtain wagons. . . . alas! those old wagons! the smaller one he had taken apart and used in making the very table around which they were now seated; as for the larger wagon, she knew only too well that it would never hang together through the long journey back; only the other day she had heard per hansa mention that he intended to break it up, and see if he couldn't make something or other out of it. . . . well--how to get the wagons would be his business! they certainly couldn't perish out here for want of a wagon or two! was there not one who once upon a time had had mercy on a great city full of wicked people, only because one just human being interceded?

. . . one just human being. . . . alas! . . . beret sighed heavily and put her hand up under her breast.

she smiled down into the eager face--a benign, spreading smile.

the father sat at the table eating, with and-ongen on his knee; the boys stood opposite him, listening enthusiastically to the story of his adventures along the way; the mother went to and fro between the stove and the table. there was an enchanting joyousness about per hansa to-day which coloured all he said; no matter how much he told, it always sounded as if he were keeping back the best till later on. this had a positively intoxicating effect on the boys; it made them impatient and eager for more, and caused a steady flood of fresh questions.

even beret was smiling, though her hand trembled.

at last the boys had to give an account of how they had managed affairs at home. when, after much teasing and banter, per hansa had finally heard the whole absurd story--i

laugh. "so that's the way you two have been acting while i was away? mother couldn't manage you, eh? . . . well, now you'll soon be dancing to a different tune; we've got so much work on our hands that there won't be any peace here day or night. . . . thanks for good food, beret-girl!"

he got up, took the boys with him, and began to carry things in from the wagon. most of the load they stored away in the house; some extra things, however, had to find a temporary place in the stable.

at length per hansa brought in a small armful of bottles and set them on the table.

"come here, beret-girl of mine! you have earned a good drink, and a good drink you shall have!" . . . he went over to the water pail with the coffee cup from which he had just been drinking, rinsed it out with a little water, and emptied it on the floor; then he poured out a good half cupful of whisky and offered it to her. she put out her hands as if to push him away. . . . yes, indeed, she would have to take it, he told her, put

ting his arm around her waist and lifting the cup to her lips. she took the cup and emptied it in one draught. . . . "there, that's a good little wife! . . . you're going to have just another little drop!" he went to the table again and poured out a second drink, but not so much this time. "two legs, and one for each! just drink it down! . . . and now you take care of the bottles!"

that was a busy day in the humble dwelling of per hansa. first of all, he had promised a load of potatoes to the hallings, who waited back east somewhere under a bleak sky, without even a potato peeling to put in their pot; he must carry food to them. when beret heard how poorly things were in that hut--about the woman with the drawn cheeks and the starved look in her eyes--she straightway began to hurry him up; he must go while he had the horses and wagon here. couldn't he get started to-day?

"not so hasty there, my girl, not so hasty!" laughed pe

"just keep your fingers moving, olamand--hurry them up, i tell you!" . . . the father made a great mystery of it, and refused to give any further explanation.

as for himself and store-hans, they busied themselves over the lime; it was all carried inside and placed in a corner where no moisture could reach it. the preparations for the mixing required a good deal of work; the first thing was to make a wooden box sufficiently tight to hold water. well, there was plenty of lumber now, at any rate! per hansa built the box and carried it down to the creek; there he placed it under water, hoping that it would swell enough to be tight by the time he needed it.

evening fell all too soon on a wonderfully busy and joyful day. the boys were at last in bed, fast asleep.

but per hansa had no time for rest; to-night that net simply had to be finished. he finally made beret go to bed, but she wasn't a bit sleepy; she lay there talking to him and filling the shuttles whenever they were empty. he explained fu

anned to catch ducks with that net; that had been the real reason for his buying the twine; there would be other fare than badger stew in this hut, he would just let her know, if the weather only held a few days more!

all at once it occurred to beret that she had forgotten to cover up the windows to-night; she smiled to herself at the discovery. . . . what was the need of it, anyway? cover the windows . . . what nonsense! . . . she smiled again, feeling a languorous drowsiness creep over her.

per hansa knit away on the net, chatting happily with her as he worked; a confident ring of joy sounded in all he said. he had fastened the net to the bedpost, just as her father always had done. she listened peacefully to his warm, cheerful voice, which after a while began to sound more distant, like the indolent swish and gurgle of lapping ocean waves on a fair summer's night. gradually she was borne away on this sound, and slept the whole night through without stirring.

. . . again day came, and brought no other light than that which the greyish-white specks gave. . . . all that day the snow fell--all the next night. . . .

at last it grew light once more--but the day had no sun. a cold wind howled about the huts--left them, and tore down into the white snow blanket, shaking out of it blinding swirls. . . . the swirls vanished and reappeared--died down, flared up again and tore on. . . . new ones constantly rose . . . many. . . .

per hansa and his boys worked like firebrands during the last days before winter set in. every task that came to their hands delighted them; they went from one fairy tale into the next--came out again, and there was a new one at hand; they gave themselves no peace, either by night or by day. . . . but beret could not share their mood; she would watch them absently as they left the house; or when they were due to return, she would wander about with and-ongen on her arm, looking for them through the window

, and keeping a hot dish in readiness on the stove. they were sure to be cold, poor fellows! . . . then when they were seated around the table, wrapped up in all their remarkable experiences, the talk would jump from one incident to another, and she would find herself unable to follow it. their liveliness and loud laughter only drove her heavy thoughts into a still deeper darkness.

she had to admit, however, that per hansa could accomplish the most marvellous things; she could not imagine where he had learned it all. . . . there were the walls, for example, of which he himself was especially proud, and which store-hans never tired of admiring. he had begun work on these walls immediately after he had returned from the trip east to the hallings' with the potatoes. the lime had been mixed according to directions, and spread over the walls--three coats of it, no less; now the sod hut shone so brightly inside that it

ed that he had touched them. her eyes were blinded wherever she looked, either outdoors or indoors; the black-brown earthen floor was the only object on which she could rest them comfortably; and so she always looked down now, as she sat in the house. but hint at it, and thus ruin his pleasure, she could not. . . . and it really didn't matter much to her, she would endure it for the brief time that remained! . . .

she was thankful enough, though, for all the fine fish that he had brought home. per hansa had taken both boys with him on the great expedition east to the sioux river; there they had made a tremendous catch with the help of the net, and per hansa had talked with the trönders about many extraordinary things, and had gained much valuable information. . . . heaps of frozen fish now lay outside all along the wall; per hansa explained to her what a god-send it was that the snow finally had come. hm! good heavens! if it hadn't come soon he would have been obliged to go out and get it! no

w he was spared that trouble; with the aid of the snowdrifts they could have fresh fish through the whole winter. . . . "hey, woman!" he said with a laugh, whenever she complained of how desolate it was since the snow had come. "can't you understand that we could never manage things without the snow? . . . hey, wife--white and fine, both outdoors and indoors! . . . wonder if something couldn't be done to the floor, too?" . . .

now it came to light what had been working in per hansa's mind when he had bought all that salt; he salted down quantities of the fish, and packed them away in all the vessels they could spare.

but in the opinion of the boys, the duck hunt with the net was the crowning adventure. never had there been such an enthusiastic party; the father was almost the worst of the three! now the great secret of his planning and scheming over the ducks was revealed. while store-hans and his brother had only talked about capturing them and wondered what could be do

ne, per hansa had figured out every detail in his mind; if the ducks got the best of him on one tack, he would fool them on another; into the net somehow they must go! . . . for three nights they had all stayed out in the swamps to the westward, toiling and fighting among the myriads of birds; in the morning they would come home after daylight, wet as crows, numb all over, and blue in the face with cold. but they always brought a catch! . . . as soon as the evening came they would be off again.

 . . . the boys only laughed at these objections; their mother sounded just like sofie; probably all women were alike--they had no sense. just imagine such a ridiculous idea--catch no more birds! . . . the father joined in with them and poked mild fun at the mother. how silly it would be not to grab good food when it lay right at their door! suppose the swamps were to freeze up to-night? and after they had picked the ducks, there would be fine feather beds for both herself and little per! . . . per hansa's voice softened. . . . and besides, there was no more delicate fare than those ducks on any king's table! . . .

but she would not be carried along. . . . "we won't need them!" she said, dispiritedly . . . and fell into silence.

dusk settled, the menfolk left--and she was alone with the child again.

but at last winter shut down in earnest; the swamps froze up and duck hunting came to an end for that year.

"i think we ought to carry some soup meat to our neighbours," said per hansa. . . . "t

ment had been rushed with work during the last days before father winter came. they all had a feeling that he wasn't very far away, that old fellow, and thought it best to be well prepared to receive him. hans olsa, tönseten, and the solum boys had been east to the sioux river again for wood; they had made two trips, and home had seen very little of them lately. few visits had been made; everyone had been busy with his own affairs. . . . for other reasons than this, visitors came but seldom to per hansa's now; there was something queer about the woman in that place; she said so little; at times people felt that they were unwelcome there. she was apt to break out suddenly with some remark that they could only wonder at; they hardly knew whether to be surprised or offended.

but on the day when the boys carried a gift of ducks to all the houses in the neighbourhood, proud of the dainty food they brought, and relating what sounded like a fairy tale, everyone went over to per hansa's to learn how

seten and kjersti hard upon their heels; last of all came hans olsa and sörine.

once inside, they completely forgot their curiosity about the duck hunting; they stood with their mouths open, looking up one wall and down the next.

. . . why . . . why . . . what in the wide world was this? had they plastered snow on the walls? sam thought it really was snow, and touched it gingerly with his finger. . . . what was it, anyway? could it possibly be paint? . . . my stars, how fine it looked! . . . per hansa sat there, sucking his pipe and enjoying his little triumph; it seemed to him that he had never liked his neighbours so well as at this moment. . . . beret went about listening quietly; in her face was a troubled expression. not for all the world would she have had the work on the walls undone! . . .

amazement was universal. . . . sörine smiled in her pleasant, kindly way; she went over to beret and said with warm sympathy:

"now you certainly have got a fine house! . . . you'll thrive all th

e better for it." . . . at that, she began to help her with the work. but kjersti, with an emphatic slap on her thigh, voiced it as her opinion that it was a dirty shame that she and sörrina had picked up such poor sticks for husbands! why couldn't they ever hatch up some nice scheme? why was per hansa the only man among them with his head on the right end? yes, they certainly ought to feel ashamed of themselves, sitting there! . . . tönseten took offence at this; he felt constrained to remind her that he was the fellow who had risen to the occasion and captured the sognings! she'd better remember that; for what would have become of them all in the long run if the sognings hadn't joined them? . . . "and i don't exactly see what this new notion of per hansa's is really good for," he spluttere

d on. "it's getting to be so damned swell in here that pretty soon a fellow can't even spit!" . . . tönseten looked accusingly at beret; it was from her that per hansa got these stuck-up airs. she was never willing to be like plain folks, that woman! . . . the solum boys took great delight in the white walls; this was really beautiful. when they got married they would do the very same thing!

hans olsa sucked his pipe and said but little. this seemed very queer to him; he turned it over and over in his mind, but couldn't solve the problem. was this like per hansa, who had always confided everything to him? . . . but here he was going about doing everything al

one! when he had learned how a black earthen wall could be made shining white at so small a cost, why hadn't he told the others? there was so little cheer out here; they all sorely needed to share whatever they found. . . . the big, rugged features were very sober; he had to look hard at per hansa. no, it was the same good-natured face that one liked so well to have near by! this affair was just one of his many pranks; the longer hans olsa gazed at his neighbour, the more plausible grew this solution inside that big head of his.

awhile later, as the two men stood together outside the door, watching the falling snow, he said, quietly:

"you have made it pretty fine inside, per hansa; but he who is now whitening the outside of your walls does fully as well. . . . you shouldn't be vain in

your own strength, you know!"

"oh, nonsense, hans olsa!" laughed per hansa. "what are you prating about? . . . here, take along a couple more ducks for sörrina!" . . .

it was well enough that winter had come at last, thought per hansa; he really needed to lay off and rest awhile. after a good square meal of ducks or fresh fish, he would light his pipe and stretch himself, saying:

"ha!--now we're really as well off here, my beret-girl, as anybody could ever wish to be!" . . . he did not always expect an answer, and seldom got one. then he would throw himself on the bed and take a good after-dinner nap, often sleeping continuously on into the night. . . . life seemed very pleasant now!

in this fashion he spent quite a number

 of days; the bad weather still held out. per hansa continued to do full justice to the fare. when he had eaten his fill he would point out again to beret how well off they were, and go to his couch to sleep the sleep of the righteous. it was almost uncanny--he could never seem to get sleep enough! he slept both day and night; and still he felt the need of more rest. . . . now and then he would go to the door to look out at the weather, and glance across toward the neighbours. no . . . nothing to do outside--the weather was too beastly! he would

 come in again, and stretch himself, and yawn. . . .

the days wore on.

yes, they wore on. . . . one exactly like the other. . . . per hansa couldn't grasp the strange contradiction that had begun to impress him; he knew that the days were actually growing shorter--were being shorn more closely by every passing night; but--weren't they growing longer?

indeed they were--no question about it! they finally grew so long that he was at a dead loss to find something to do with which to end them. he assured himself that all this leisure was very fine; that he needed to ease up a bit; during the fall he hadn't spared himself; now it felt l

e yet! . . .

the days only grew longer and longer.

in the end, this enforced idleness began to gall him. the landscape showed a monotonous sameness . . . never the slightest change. . . . grey sky--damp, icy cold. . . . snow fell . . . snow flew. . . . he could only guess now where the huts of hans olsa lay. there wasn't a thing to do outdoors; plenty of wood lay chopped and ready for use; it took but a little while to do the chores. . . . beyond this, everything took care of itself outside.

per hansa sat by the table, or lay down on the bed when he got tired of sitting up; tried to sleep as long as possible; woke up with a start; turned over and tried to sleep again; rose and sat by the table once more, when he grew weary of lying down.

the days wore on, and yet got nowhere. . . . time had simply come to a standstill! he had never seen the like; this was worse than the deadest lay-up in lofoten!

the boys were almost as badly off; they too sat restless and idle; and because they had nothin

nterminably. a cold, piercing wind from the northeast blew the livelong day, and moaned about the corners at night. . . . snow flew . . . more snow fell.

no sun. . . . no sky. . . . the air was a grey, ashen mist which breathed a deathly chill; it hung around and above them thick and frozen. . . . in the course of time there was a full moon at night, somewhere behind the veil. then the mist grew luminous and alive--strange to behold. . . . night after night the ghostly spectacle would return.

per hansa would gaze at it and think: now the trolls are surely abroad! . . .

 

one evening tönseten and kjersti came over. they sat and talked until it grew very late. one could readily see that syvert was out of sorts about something; he puffed at his pipe in glum, ill humor, glared at per hansa's walls, and didn't have much to say. when he did speak his voice was unnecessarily loud.

kjersti and beret sat together on the bed; they seemed to be finding a good deal to chat about.

kjersti was in an u

ord took both mother and child, right there and then! he had taken away what he had refused to give in honour, and more besides. . . . there was something mysterious about such things, didn't beret think so? and wasn't it strange that the father should have been so fond of that child? . . . kjersti had known them both very well.

beret listened attentively to this tale, putting in a word here and there.

over at the table, the men had pricked up their ears as the story began; they heard it all. per hansa looked at syvert and laughed; syvert, in turn, glared at the wall and said, angrily:

"i should think you'd be able to find something american to talk about! . . . we're through now with all that troll business over in norway!" . . . he got up and started to go. . . .

but per hansa wouldn't listen to their leaving just yet; since they had braved the weather to make a call they might as well sit awhile longer. . . . "you'll have the wind astern, syvert, going home! . . . come on, sit down and b

ns, all sewed with the greatest care. it was a beautiful cap; all had to see it; there were many warm words of praise. beret received it in silence; her eyes were wet as she took the cap and laid it carefully in the big chest. . . .

to-night it was beret who refused to let the visitors leave. she absolutely insisted. such quantities of food lay outside around the house--far more than they would ever need--that they might as well stay for supper and help to eat it! . . . this proposal overjoyed per hansa. it was the plain truth, as beret said, they had more than they needed--and there was plenty left in the sioux river, for that matter; to-night they were going to celebrate with fresh fish for supper! . . . he went outside and brought in a generous supply of the frozen fish, which he scaled and cut up; he was in the finest of spirits--it seemed just like the good old days in lofoten.

. . . that evening was a happy interlude for them all.

 here it was, only the middle of november! it seemed to per hansa, as he sat by the table puffing his pipe and following beret around with his eyes, that many winters must have gone by already.

he found himself watching beret very often; during the last two weeks he had discovered many things about her which he had never noticed before. just trifles, they were, but so many of them--one thing after another. sitting here now with nothing else to occupy his mind, he began slowly and carefully to piece together what he had observed; the result pleased him less a

"i really think you ought to go and fix up your hair, beret-girl. . . . i kind of feel that we're going to have company to-day."

she gave him a quick glance, blushed deeply, rose, and left the room. he heard her go into the stable, where she stayed a long time; he couldn't imagine what she was doing in there at that hour of the day. her acti

 her; he would have liked to say something kind and loving to her now. but she did not glance at him, and so he dared not speak. . . . in a little while he found an excuse to go out; passing close to her, he said in a tender, admiring voice:

"now we've got a fine-looking lady!"

all the rest of that day he felt happier than he had been for a long while. . . . of course his beret-girl would be all right. . . . indeed, she was all right, as far as that went! . . .

but . . . other days followed. per hansa remained idle and had nothing to do but look at his wife. he looked and looked, until he had to face the hard fact that something was wrong.

. . . had she ever been so brooding and taciturn when she was with child before? he could talk to the boys about the future until they would be completely carried away by his visions; but whenever he tried to draw her into the conversation he failed completely--failed, no matter which tack he took nor how hard he tried. he understood it clearly: it wasn't

"it looks as if your eyes were in your way, mother!" store-hans once exclaimed, laughing so heartily that the others had to join in; but per hansa soon noticed that she was hurt when they made fun of her.

one day she was looking for the scissors. she had been sitting by the stove, mending a garment; had risen to put on more fuel; and when she sat down again had been unable to find her scissors, which she held all the while in her hand. she searched diligently, and asked the others to help her. suddenly ole discovered the scissors in his mother's hand; he ran up to her and jerked them away; the boy was roaring with laughter. . . . then sh

and sometimes she had moments of unusual tenderness toward them all--particularly toward per hansa. her concern would grow touchingly childlike; it was as if she could not do enough for him and the children. but it was a tenderness so delicate that he dared not respond to it. nevertheless, he felt very happy when these moods came; they gave him renewed courage.

. . . such evenings were dangerous for all life. to the strong they brought reckless laughter--for who had ever seen such moon-nights? . . . to the weak they brought tears, hopeless tears. this was not life, but eternity itself. . . .

per hansa sat in his hut, ate, drank, puffed at his pipe, and followed his wife with his eyes in vague alarm; for the life of him he didn't know what to do. where could he betake himself? it wouldn't do for him to go from house to house, when things were in such a bad way at home. . . . no, here he was condemned to sit! . . . his temper was growing steadily worse; he found it more and more difficult to keep his hands off things.

he would be seized by a sudden, almost irresistible desire to take beret, h

 what great sport it would be to fish with a net through the ice! from the trönders, who were old settlers in this region, he could get a lot more valuable information; it was really remarkable, what they had told him last time, about the fur trade with the indians north at flandreau. . . . whenever the thought of this journey came to him he could hardly push it aside.

. . . useless even to dream of such a thing! here was poor beret, pottering helplessly about--he must think only of her.

and per hansa tried his best to think of her to some effect. he had noticed that she minded the cold; she never complained, but he was well aware of it; from now on he tended the fire himself and kept the stove red hot most of the day. in spite of that he couldn't get the house properly warm when the cold was at its worst; the earthen floor was always cold and beret's feet seemed particularly sensitive.

one day per hansa got an idea which gave him much diversion. while they had been busy chopping the wood h

"you might have thought of this before, it seems to me. here i have gone with cold feet all winter." . . . the words were uttered quietly; she meant no reproach by them, but merely said what came into her mind.

he turned away and went out of the house; outside the door he paused, and stood for a long time gazing off into the evening. . . . somewhere out there life was still happy. . . . there was no solitude. . . . didn't it seem to call to him?

per hansa felt that now he needed to cry. . . .

a day came when per hansa flared up in a rage that frightened even himself; he struck out blindly and smashed whatever happened to lie within his reach. it was one of the solum boys that brought it about. one forenoon henry came over and sat chatting for a long while, as if he had nothing in particular on his mind; per hansa was glad of the visit, and urged henry to stay. when the lad finally rose to go he asked if per hansa would be willing to k

eep their cow until the time of the spring planting; he could have the calf she would drop in january, so he would be nothing out; and there was plenty of hay left in their barn, which could be hauled over . . . henry spoke slowly, without looking up; he seemed almost ashamed to explain his errand.

per hansa's eyes blinked fast. . . . this was indeed handsome of henry; imagine his thinking more of beret and the children than of himself! in fact, it was so generous, and handsomely done, that per hansa felt quite overcome; his eyes blinked till they watered. . . . but he mustn't take an offer like this! true enough, rosie was drying up and milk wasn't very plentiful in their house; but they had learned to get along without it; they made plenty of soup, and that filled the same need. no, it would never do to take the milk away from the solum boys. . . . "i don't very well see how i can take your cow," per hansa answered.

henry seemed perplexed, looked down at the floor, and apparently did not

 know how to go on.

--well, that wasn't exactly the idea, he said. . . . he and his brother had made a sleigh, and now they wanted to try it out. the cow couldn't be left alone after they were gone.

per hansa's eyes fairly danced; he leaned across the table, speaking fast and eagerly: the devil you say--going east to the sioux river, perhaps? . . . what? . . . he wished to the lord he could go along with them! couldn't they hold up for just a little white--until he got ready? . . . he threw a swift glance at his wife.

--no, that wasn't exactly the idea, either, henry confessed, still more embarrassed. their parents were sitting alone, back there in minnesota; he and sam had agreed that they had bet

ter go east and celebrate christmas with the old folks. they had been getting pretty lonesome here, anyway; there seemed to be nothing to do in the dead of winter; but they fully intended to come back in the spring, as soon as the prairie was open. . . . couldn't he do them the favour of keeping the cow?

for an instant all the light seemed to die out of per hansa's face: then it suddenly flared up again in a flame of rage that positively snapped and crackled.

"take your damned old cow along with you, henry! we want none of your milk!" . . . his lips trembled like those of one on the point of bursting into tears.

--well--said henry, calmly--if that was the way per hansa felt about it, he would have to ask some of the others; he certainly didn't want to force the cow on anyone! if they could find no other way out of it, they would have to slaughter the

it was then that the storm broke loose in earnest. . . . the boys were sitting at the table, each with a piece of charcoal, drawing ponies and indians on top; those of store-hans's were waging war against ole's; the boys were so taken up with their play that they hardly noticed what was going on in the room. beret sat by the stove, mending a garment; the child had also been given needle and thread, and was industriously sewing away at a piece of rag. . . . per hansa stood at the window, glaring out.

all at once beret remarked in her quiet manner, without looking up, that it didn't seem a bit strange to her that the solum boys wanted to leave the place. why should they lie exiled out here in the wilderness?

it was as if something had suddenly stung per hansa; he wheeled quickly and looked at his wife, his eyes hard and glazed.

--well, why didn't he go to work and do it, then?

go to work?--he snarled.--did she need to ask why he wasn't doing anything? was she in such a condition that he could ever leave the house? . . .

--oh, she was in the condition he had brought her to--no worse and no better--she said. now her words, too, vibrated with passion.--no, indeed, he didn't need to sit at home on her account! she added sharply.

per hansa drove his fist into the table with a terrible crash. the boys jumped up in fright and shrank away--never had they seen their father like this; he looked as if he would strike their mother the next instant. little and-ongen threw the rag in her mother's lap, put her hand into her mouth, and screamed in terror.

"you talk like a fool! . . . that only shows how much sense you've got!"

he saw a cap over on a wall somewhere, seized it, found the door, and was gone. . . .

--was there anything going on? sörine asked.

--no, not exactly that--though it must be nearly time now. but sörine ought to remember that it was pretty lonesome for her, sitting there alone, unable even to go outside the door. day after day beret neither saw nor heard another person, outside of the family!

--yes, certainly--she would be glad to run over!

--could she go right away?

--was there such an awful hurry?--sörine still suspected per hansa's denial. if that was the case, he had better go and get kjersti at once; she didn't care to tackle this job alone!

--no, no--it wasn't that!

sörine went in for a moment to put on her coat; soon she came out again, ready to start. he went with her for some distance. . . .

--wasn't he coming along?--she asked, stopping to look inquiringly at him.

--no, he guessed he wouldn't; he needed to have a little talk with hans olsa to-night. he only wanted to say this: that she who understood all suc

sörine's kind, intelligent face looked straight into his.

"i can see that you're worried about your wife to-night, per hansa. . . . that's fine of you, i say!"

"god richly bless you for those words, sörrina!"

per hansa suddenly felt like a new person; and yet he lacked the courage to look up.

"but let me tell you one thing, sörrina: i'm not half so worried about my wife as i am about myself! to-day i nearly laid hands on her--that's how fine i am, and now you know it! . . . hurry along!"

"you ought to have a whaling for that, per hansa!" she said with a laugh, but immediately grew serious. . . . "alas! life lays a hard hand on all of us! . . . well, now i'm off. you don't need to hurry to-night--if we need

he had barely entered hans olsa's house, found a seat, and lighted his pipe, when another visitor arrived. tonseten came in, apparently in a bad humour; no, he didn't want to sit down; he was going farther on in a minute or two. did they know that the solum boys were about to leave?

"i guess we

"but this won't do, folks, i tell you--it simply won't do! as kjersti says, soon we'll have nothing but the snow left!"

"and i hope that'll go in time, too," laughed per hansa.

"it probably will!" tönseten snapped, irritably. "but what i don't understand is, why have you folks let things come to such a pass?"

"we . . . ?" per hansa asked.

"yes, you! . . . the two of you!"

"we can't very well tie up the boys, when they are bent on going," said hans olsa.

"i didn't say we could!" . . . tönseten stood in front of him, waving his arms excitedly. "but we can use common sense, can't we?"

"very well, syvert, let's hear your common sense," spoke up per hansa.

"you talk like a fool, per hansa! here you both sit around and twiddle your thumbs, doing nothing; but you've got cubs, and will soon have more! why don't you join for

 to teach school for your brats this winter? there's a good enough head on henry's shoulders, let me tell you; he hasn't had much schooling, to be sure; but the boy was born and raised in this country, and can sling the english like a native--that much i know. . . . i haven't any brats of my own to send; but i'll gladly chip in a few dollars, when my wheat is threshed next fall!" . . . tönseten seemed to have the details fully laid out, as usual.

the other two listened in silence. the eyes of per hansa began to shoot rapid, sparkling glances, which always betrayed the fact that he was in good humour; but it was some time before he opened his mouth. hans olsa sat pondering over the new idea that had just been proposed; it was perfectly true that the children needed schooling; but how did this bear on the case, when the solum boys were ready and determined to go?

"i see you're still hesitating!" tönseten exclaimed, snappishly. "listen here, now: we're all going straight over to the solum boys

g, hans olsa! how many times have you made up your mind, i'd like to know, and then unmade it again? . . . i can assure you of one thing, fellows: if we let sam and henry slip away from us now, it's certainly doubtful if we ever see them again--single and unhitched as they are! that's just kjersti's opinion, too. then won't we be left in a fine mess, i ask you--for what chance would we stand of ever getting such good neighbours again?"

"we might try it," hans olsa conceded. "what do you think, per hansa?"

per hansa jumped up from his chair. "i'll do whatever you say, friends. we can get no worse than a refusal." . . . but then he remembered something, and hesitated for a moment. . . . "i really oughtn't to be going over there; but--oh, well! who cares!" he grabbed up his cap impulsively. . . . "i might as well give henry a chance to tell me what he thinks of me! . . . the sooner, the better!"

they held a lengthy conference with the solum boys that night. outside of their hut the sleigh waite

there was a note in his voice that put all joking aside, even though they had to laugh at him now and then:

"if you leave this place, you'll have to take kjersti and me along with you, though i don't know what we would do with ourselves back in minnesota! she and i crossed the red sea, as it were, when we left last spring. . . . for her and me there is no road leading back! . . . what do you think we're going to do, i'd like to know, when you are gone? at hans olsa's they don't play cards; and per hansa, poor devil--well, he has a sick woman on his hands. . . . god alone knows how that business is going to come off. that's just what kjersti says, too!"

per hansa had been silent ever since he came in; now he knocked the ashes out of his pipe, rose from the chest, and turned to henry:

"i'll tell you exactly how we stand--and this is gospel truth. if you and sam leave us now, it'll be so dull and dreary for the rest of us that we might as well hang ourselves. you saw how i went to pieces to-day

per hansa had spoken with forced calmness; the seriousness of the situation bore in upon them all. everyone in the room had the same thought: this strong man was likely at any minute to burst into tears.

. . . a long silence fell. tönseten blew his nose violently between his fingers, after which he wiped them off on his trousers.

at last henry spoke--his voice was husky and subdued:

"it's harder on us than it is on you. we have only each other; but you have wives and children to squabble with!"

the stillness out here had given her full opportunity for reflection; all the fall she had done nothing but brood and remember. . . . alas! she had much to remember!

she had accepted the hand of per hansa because she must--although no law had compelled her; she and he were the only people who had willed it thus. she had been gotten with child by him out of wedlock; nevertheless, no one had compelled her to marry him--neither father, nor mother, nor anyone in authority. it had been wholly her own doing. her parents, in fact, had set themselves against the marriage with all their might, even after the child, ole, had come.

no one had ever told her, but she knew full well who it was that had persuaded hans olsa to leave the land and the ancient farm that had been in his family for generations, and go to america. there had been only one other person in the world whom per hansa loved, and that was hans olsa. she had been jealous of hans olsa because of this; it had seemed to her that he took something that rightfully belonged to her. she had even felt the same way toward sörine, who was kindness itself; on this account she had not been able to hold her friendship as fully as she needed to, either in norway or here. . . .

. . . how her mother had wept at that time! . . . how her father had grieved when they had left! time after time he had come begging to per hansa, offering him all that he had--boat and fishing outfit, house and farm--if only he would settle down in norway and not take their daughter from them forever. . . . but per hansa had laughed it all aside! there had been a power in his unflinching determination which had sent hot waves through her. she must have led a double life at that time; she had been sad with her parents but had rejoiced with per hansa. he had raged like a storm through those days, wild and reckless--and sometimes ruthless,

into this feverish atmosphere they had come. could destiny have spun his web more cunningly? she remembered well how the eyes of per hansa had immediately begun to gleam and glow! . . . and the strange thing about this spell had been that he had become so very kind under it. how playfully affectionate he had grown toward her during the last winter and spring! it had been even more deliriously sweet to give herself to him then, than back in those days when she had first won him. was it not worth all the care and sorrow in the world to taste such bliss, she had often asked herself--but had been unable to answer. but--then it had hap

she realized now the great forethought he had shown last summer in building the house and stable under one roof. they undoubtedly had the warmest house in the neighbourhood; and then she enjoyed the company of the animals as she lay awake at night; it felt so cosy and secure to lie there and listen to them. . . . she could easily distinguish each animal b

 . . . toward evening he suddenly wanted to go home, and was almost beside himself when his godfather said that he couldn't: all the children were to stay with sofie to-night. they had to hold him back by force. . . . this was christmas eve. . . . he understood very well that something was about to go wrong at home. why had his mother looked so wan and worn of late, and his father acted so queer that one couldn't talk to him?

that afternoon beret was in childbed. . . . the grim struggle marked per hansa for life; he had fought his way through many a hard fight, but they had all been as nothing compared with this. he had ridden the frail keel of a capsized boat on the lofoten seas, had seen the huge, combing waves snatch away his comrades one by one, and had rejoiced in the thought that the end would soon come for him also; but things of that sort had been mere child's play. . . . this was the uttermost darkness. here was neither beginning nor end--only an awful void in which he groped alone. .

burden to you lately. . . . you had better give and-ongen to kjersti . . . she wants a child so badly--she is a kind woman. . . . you must take the boys with you--and go away from here! . . . how lonesome it will be for me . . . to lie here all alone!"

tears came to her eyes, but she did not weep; between moans she went on strongly and collectedly:

"but promise me one thing: put me away in the big chest! . . . i have emptied it and made it ready. . . . promise to lay me away in the big chest, per hansa! . . . and you must be sure to dig the grave deep! . . . you haven't heard how terribly the wolves howl at night! . . . promise to take plenty of time and dig deep down--do you hear!"

his wife's request cut per hansa's heart like sharp ice; he threw himself on his knees beside the bed and wiped the cold perspiration from her face with a shaking hand.

. . . "there now, blessed beret-girl of mine!" . . . his words sounded far off--a note of frenzy in them. . . . "can't you understand that this

the throes were tearing her so violently now that she could say no more. but when she saw him rise she made a great effort and sat up in bed.

. . . "oh!--don't leave me!--don't go away! . . . can't you see how sorely i need you? . . . and now i shall die! . . . love me--oh, do love me once more, per hansa!" . . . she leaned her body toward him. . . . "you must go back to norway. . . . take the children with you . . . let them grow up there. ask father and mother to forgive me! . . . tell father that i am lying in the big chest! . . . can't you stay with me to-night . . . stay with me and love me? . . . oh!--there they come for me!"

beret gave a long shriek that rent the night. then she sobbed violently, praying that they should not take her away from per hansa. . . .

et, and found his voice.

"satan--now you shall leave her alone!" he shouted, flinging the door open and calling loudly to the women outside. then he vanished into the darkness.

no one thought of seeking rest that night. all the evening, lights shone from the four huts; later they were extinguished in two of them; but in the house of hans olsa four men sat on, grieving over the way things were going at per hansa's. when they could bear the suspense no longer some one proposed going over to get news.

tönseten offered to go first. . . . when he came back little sense could be gathered from what he said. he had not been allowed inside; the women were in a frenzy; the house was completely upset; beret was wailing so loud that it was dreadful to hear. and per hansa himself was nowhere to be found. . . . "we must go and look for him, boys! . . . haven't you got a bible or something to read from, hans olsa?

 this is an awful thing!"

. . . there they sat, each occupied with his own thoughts--but all their thoughts were of the same trend. if beret died to-night, it would go hard with per hansa--indeed it would. in that case he probably wouldn't stay out here very long. . . . but if he went away, the rest of them might as well pack up and go, too!

sam ran over to inquire; then henry; at last it was hans olsa's turn. he managed to get a couple of words with his wife, who said that beret would hardly stand it. no one had seen per hansa.

"can you imagine where the man can be keeping himself?" asked tönseten, giving voice to the fear that oppressed them all. . . . "may the lord preserv

per hansa walked to and fro outside the hut all night long; when he heard some one coming he would run away into the darkness. he could not speak to a living soul to-night. as soon as the visitor had gone he would approach the hut again, circle around it, stop, and listen. tears were streaming down his face, though he was not aware of it. . . . every shriek that pierced the walk of the hut drove him off as if a whip had struck him; but as soon as it had died out, something would draw him back again. at i

that was all the comfort sörine could give him. . . . then he would rush off into the darkness again, to continue his endless pacing; when daylight came they found a hard path tr

amped into the snow around the hut.

the night was well-nigh spent when the wails in there began to weaken--then died out completely, and did not come again. per hansa crept up to the door, laid his ear close to it, and listened. . . . so now the end had come! his breath seemed to leave him in a great sob. the whole prairie began to whirl around with him; he staggered forward a few steps and threw himself face downward on the snow.

. . . but then suddenly things didn't seem so bad to him . . . really not so bad. . . . he saw a rope . . . a rope. . . . it was a good, strong rope that would hold anything. . . . it hung just inside the barn door--and the crossb

eam ran just there! . . . no trick at all to find these things. per hansa felt almost happy at the thought; that piece of rope was good and strong--and the crossbeam ran just there!

. . . a door opened somewhere; a gleam of light flashed across the snow, and vanished. some one came out of the hut quietly--then stopped, as if searching.

"per hansa!" a low voice called. . . . "per hansa, where are you?" . . . he rose and staggered toward kjersti like a drunken man.

"you must come in at once!" she whispered, and hurried in before him.

the light was dim in there; nevertheless it blinded him so strongly that he could not see a thing. he stood a moment leaning against the door until his eyes had grown accustomed to it. . . . a snug, cosy warmth enveloped him; it carried with it an odd, pleasant odour. the light, the warmth, and the pleasant smell overcame him like sweet sleep th

it?" he heard a man's voice ask. then he came back to his senses. . . . was that he himself speaking? . . .

"you'll have to ask sörrina," kjersti answered.

sörine was tending something on the bed; not until now did he discover her--and wake up completely. . . . what was this? . . . the expression on her face? wasn't it beaming with motherly goodness and kindliness?

"yes, here's your little fellow! i have done all i know how. come and look at him. . . . it's the greatest miracle i ever saw, per hansa, that you didn't lose your wife to-night, and the child too! . . . i pray the lord i never have to suffer so!"

"is there any hope?" was all per hansa could gasp--and then he clenched his teeth.

"it looks so, now--but you had better christen him at once. . . . we had to handle him roughly, let me tell you."

"christen him?" per hansa repeated, unable to comprehend the words.

"why, yes, of course. i wouldn't wait, if he were mine."

per hansa heard no more--for now beret turned her head and a

oy welled up in him that all the ice melted. he found himself crying softly, sobbing like a child. . . . he approached the bed on tiptoe, bent over it, and gazed down into the weary, pale face. it lay there so white and still; her hair, braided in two thick plaits, flowed over the pillow. all the dread, all the tormenting fear that had so long disfigured her features, had vanished completely. . . . she turned her head a little, barely opened her eyes, and said, wearily:

"oh, leave me in peace, per hansa. . . . now i was sleeping so well."

. . . the eyelids immediately closed.

per hansa stood for a long time looking at his wife, hardly daring to believe what he saw. she slept peacefully; a small bundle lay beside her, from which peeped out a tiny, red, wrinkled face. . . . as he continued to gaze at her he sensed clearly that this moment was making him a better man!

at last he gathered his wits sufficiently to turn to sörine and ask:

"tell me, what sort of a fellow is this you h

ave brought me--a boy or a girl?"

"heavens! per hansa, how silly you talk!" . . . kjersti and sörine both had to laugh as they looked at per hansa; such a foolish, simple expression they had never seen on the face of a living man! . . . but sörine immediately grew serious once more, and said that this was no time for joking; the way they had tugged and pulled at him during the night, you couldn't tell what might happen; per hansa must get the child christened right away; if he put if off, she refused to be responsible.

a puzzled expression came over the grinning face.

"you'd better do that christening yourself, sörrina!"

--no!--she shook her head emphatically. that wasn't a woman's job--he must understand! . . . "and you ought to have it done with proper decorum, and thank the lord for doing so well by you!"

without another word per hansa found his cap and went to the door; but there he paused a moment to say:

"i

know only one person around here who is worthy to perform such an act; since you are unwilling, i must go and get him. . . . in the meanwhile, you make ready what we will need; the hymn book you'll find on the shelf over by the window. . . . i won't be long!"

the kindly eyes of sörine beamed with joy and pride; she knew very well the one he intended to get; this was really handsome of per hansa! . . . but then another thought crossed her mind; she followed him out, and closed the door after her.

"wait a minute," she said. "i must tell you that your boy had the helmet1 on when he came! . . . i think you ought to find a very beautiful name for him!"

"what are you saying, sörrina!"

"yes, sir--that he had! . . . and you know what that means!"

per hansa drew his sleeve across his face--then turned and walked away. a moisture dimmed his eyes--he could not see. . . .

outside it was now broad daylight; the sun stood some distance up in the sky, looking down on a desolate earth. it was going to be cold to-day, per hansa noticed; clouds of frosty mist like huge writhing serpents curled over the surface of the purplish-yellow plain. the sunbeams plunging into them kindled a weird light. he tingled with the cold; his eyelashes froze together so that he had to rub them with his mittens to keep them free.

. . . how remarkable--the child had been born with the helmet on! . . . he quickened his pace; in a moment he was running. . . .

"peace be upon this house, and a merry christmas, folks!" he greeted them as he en

olsa's door. . . . the room was cold; the solum boys lay in one bed, fully dressed; both were so sound asleep that they did not wake up at his coming. his own children and sofie lay in the other bed, ole by himself down at the foot, the other three on the pillow; store-hans held and-ongen close, as if trying to protect her. hans olsa and tönseten had moved their chairs up to the stove, and sat hunched over on either side; tönseten was nodding, the other was wide awake; both men jumped up when per hansa came in, and stood staring at him.

per hansa had to laugh outright at them; they were looking at him as if they had seen a ghost. but to the two men his laugh sounded pleasanter than anything they had heard in many a year.

"how are things coming?" asked tönseten, excitedly, working his shoulders.

"oh, it might have been worse!"

hans olsa grasped his hand: "will she pull through?"

"it looks that way."

then tönseten suddenly seemed to realize that it was cold in the room; he began to walk

 around, beating goose with his arms. . . . "i'm ready to bet both my horses that it's a boy! i can see it in your face!" he exclaimed, still beating.

"all signs point that way, syvert! but he's in pretty poor condition, sörrina tells me. . . . now look here, hans olsa: it's up to you to come over and christen the boy for me!"

hans olsa looked terror-stricken at his neighbour. . . . "you must be crazy, per hansa!"

"nothing of the kind, hans olsa. . . . you just get yourself ready. . . . it's all written down in the hymn book--what to say, and how to go about it."

"no, no--i couldn't think of such a thing!" protested hans olsa, all of a tremble with the feeling of awe that had suddenly taken possession of him. . . . "a sinner like me!" . . .

then per hansa made a remark that tönseten thought was extremely well put:

"how you stand with the lord i don't know. but this i do know: that a better man eit

ahead; his helplessness grew so great that he was funny to look at; but no one thought of laughing, just the same. . . . "if it only won't be blasphemy!" . . . he finally straggled into his big coat and put on his mittens. then he turned to tönseten. . . . "the book says: 'in an extreme emergency a layman may perform this act'--isn't that so?"

"yes, yes--just so! . . . whatever else you'll need, is written there too!"

through the frosty morning the two men walked silently across the prairie, per hansa in the lead. when they had covered half the distance he stopped short and said to his neighbour:

"if it had been a girl, you see, she should have been named beret--i decided that a long while ago. . . . but seeing that it's a boy, we'll have to name him per, you must say peder, of course! . . . i've thought a good deal about joseph--he was a pretty fine lad, no doubt. . . . but grandfather's name was per, and there wasn't a braver, worthier man on that part of the coast; so it'll just have to

 the stove; the coffeepot was boiling. the table had been spread with a white cover; upon it lay the open hymn book, with the page turned down. beside the hymn book stood a bowl of water; beside that lay a piece of white cloth. . . . kjersti was tending the stove, piling the wood in diligently. . . . sörine sat in the corner, crooning over a tiny bundle; out of the bundle at intervals came faint, wheezy chirrups, like the sounds that rise from a nest of young birds.

an irresistible force drew per hansa to the bed. . . . she lay sound asleep. . . . thank god, that awful look of dread had not come back! he straightened himself up and glanced around the room; never before had he seen anything that looked so beautiful. . . .

sörine got up, went to the table, and bared a little rosy human head.

"if you are going to be the minister here," she said, turning to her husband, who had remained standing motionless at the door, "then you must hurry up and get ready. . . . first of all you must wash you

. he went up to the table, took the book, and read the ritual in a trembling voice, slowly, with many pauses. and so he christened the child peder victorious, pronouncing the name clearly. whereupon he said the lord's prayer so beautifully, that kjersti exclaimed she had never heard the like.

"there, now!" said kjersti with great emphasis. "i don't believe there is a thing lacking to make this christening perfectly correct! . . . now the coffee is ready and we're all going to have a cup."

but per hansa was searching over in the corner; at last he produced a bottle. first he treated sörine; then kjersti. . . . "if ever two people have earned something good, you two are it! . . . come on, now, have another little drop! . . . and hurry up about it, please! hans olsa and i feel pretty weak in the knees ourselves!"

. . . after a while both food and drink were served. . . . "it looks as if we were going to have a real christmas, after all!" said per hansa with a laugh, as they sat around the tabl

, and then lay still with satisfied little gruntings. the movement hurt her, but it gladdened her heart, too; for all the world she would not have had it otherwise. life was returning; instead of that stiff, cold horror, beret's body grew warmer and stronger with every day that passed. and the grunts at her side became more and more insistent. . . . ah, well, she would have to shift him over, then, so that there might be peace for a moment!

. . . "thank god, you have food enough for him!" said per hansa. . . . "i never saw a youngster with such an appetite!" . . .

when beret had finally awakened on that christmas day, she had acted exactly like the old woman in the fairy tale. she lay still, peeping out at her surroundings and asking herself: "am i still here? is this me?" . . . she could not believe it, and she would not believe it, either. . . . hadn't she finished with this place some time ago?

but here she was, after all. daylight shone broadly through the window and lit up the room; woo

d crackled in the stove; the very walls per hansa had whitewashed--so different they were from other walls--rose before her. she saw spots that she recognized; she had had endless trouble with the spots on these white walls, and the boys always so careless. . . . clothes hung beside the stove, and above it stretched diapers on a line. the smell of wet clothes drying was familiar, but she could not understand where the diapers had come from. . . . neither per hansa nor the children were in sight. . . . where could they be? a quick thought crossed her mind: surely per hansa would not have let and-ongen go out without bundling her up? . . . there was a woman working about the stove, but beret could not see her face. perhaps it was kjersti. wasn't she wearing kjersti's plaid sunday skirt? . . . no, no, beret could not understand it at all. had kjersti gone with her, then, when she had departed--kjersti, who was such a good woman? . . .

st for her, then! ah no! he probably had felt that he could not do without it. but it hurt her deeply to know it; she had so much wanted to lie in the old chest that she loved.

at last she sank into a doze, hovering gently on the borderline between sleep and waking. . . . for an instant she dropped off into unconsciousness; then she awoke with a start and felt that things were growing clearer. everything in the house seemed to be in order. but she felt a vague, troubled curiosity to know where per hansa was, with and-ongen and the boys. . . . probably they had all gone over to hans olsa's? . . . slowly the fragments of thought were finding one another in her mind, meeting and coming together, and taking on natural shape and form. a sense of well-being swept over her, so strong and healthy that it gradually calmed her senses and carried her off into a sound sleep.

she was awakened awhile later by dreaming that she had been borne upward in the midst of something soft and warm . . . in an infini

"he's off with henry and sam, hunting wolf tracks," store-hans hastened to answer, happy because his mother was awake again. . . . "won't you let us see permand?"1

 

1 per, contracted from peder;--mand, diminutive ending like the german kin; hence, permand is equivalent to pederkin. olamand is formed in the same manner.

 

"please let us see permand," begged and-ongen; she left off stroking her mother's face and beamed down at her.

as soon as per hansa had brushed the bark and splinters from his clothes he came over to beret, took her hand, and held it silently a long time. . . . it was difficult for him to speak, but he managed to wish her a happy christmas and to thank her for her gift. . . . he would not let her hand go, although her arm was growing tired.

no, he would not let it go.

but tiny slits in his face, from the great strain he was under. . . . she knew that his heart was crying.

the knowledge brought tears to her own eyes. she lay on her back, and the tears rolled down over both temples. but she did not notice them. a sweet, heavenly peace like summer enveloped her. . . . warmth and stillness. . . . sunlight. . . . an arctic night. . . . carol of birds. . . . a great sea was throbbing and singing close at hand. . . . ah, it was good, after all, to be alive! . . .

per hansa suddenly found himself; his voice boomed out in strong tones:

"away from the bed, there, you brats. can't you see how tired mother is?"

of that day beret remembered little else except that she was weak and tired, that a mildness like summer seemed to remain hovering about her, that songs rose over a quiet sea, that a tender sun shone down, that everything was as it should be, that all the world was good. . . . during the next few days she slept and slept, and never could sleep enough. she sle

the face of a winter like this one? . . . that winter it was he who saved people from insanity and the grave.

beret began to worry and fuss, thinking they ought to have all the neighbours over on the thirteenth day after christmas. hadn't the good neighbours cared for them throughout the holidays, and long before christmas, too, as if they had been their own kin? but, weak as she felt, she did not know how she could manage the preparations. she mentioned this matter the first time she was up.

per hansa thought it a splendid idea. . . . couldn't he and the neighbour women manage the work? he went over to talk to them about it. kjersti burst out laughing and offered to come for two weeks if they wanted her. sörine was delighted, too. yes, indeed, they would come, if beret would only promise to sit still and let them do all the work.

"oh, there is a way of insuring that," said per hansa, with a roguish laugh. he had held beret on his lap before now, and he was man enough to do it again. . . .

"be sure you come early, all of you!"

and so they came for dinner on the thirteenth day of christmas, every one, and gathered in per hansa's cabin. tönseten had brought one of the bottles which per hansa had carried home for him a generation or two ago. . . . the bottle appeared suddenly on the table, and none of the others knew where it had come from. but they soon guessed the secret; for tönseten blinked secretively, hinting that his rheumatism was not so bad this winter. marvellous climate here in the west! had they noticed it? he felt so much better that perhaps he would dare to take a little drink, too. . . . then there was food; there was coffee; there were the pipes; and much friendly c

hatting went on in per hansa's cabin that day. time flew; the folks sat on into the night. at dusk the men went out to do the chores, each to his own place; they worked quickly that night. about the huts lay a thick, woolly darkness, black and heavy, with snow drifting softly out of the heart of it. in their hurry to get back to per hansa's, the men hardly noticed the weather.

all felt closely drawn together that night. their chatting became singularly intimate and hearty. when the men returned, there was another bottle on the table, not more than half full. none of them had brought it, and none could guess where it had come from.

"isn't it remarkable," marvelled tönseten, "that such things can spring up out of the very ground? this is truly the promised land! . . . ah, that is beret's work, now. . . . i know the bottle!"

 the long evening, they talked of the newcomer--and again of the newcomer--the first newcomer who had found his way to the spring creek settlement. everyone was aware of the many extraordinary things connected with his arrival. . . . cunningly he had chosen his time--the high and holy christmas morn! . . . besides, he had the caul on when he came. . . . and his father had ventured to give him that bold second name . . . victorious--that was not at all a human name! . . .

tönseten thought that per hansa had been reckless and had gone too far in giving the boy that second name. per hansa must remember that he himself was only a human being. . . . where had he been on christmas night, for instance? that was a thing tönseten would like to know! he wasn't outside, and he wasn't inside. . . . tönseten had said a good many things like this to kjersti when he had first heard about the name.

but that was one time when tönseten should have kept still! . . . kjersti had been very angry with him and

 had added, viciously: did she suppose that he could bear children? . . . oh, he could talk like a fool . . . he could . . . she had cried, stamping her foot on the floor. he could do anything but what he ought to! he was good for nothing in the world, the weak-kneed loafer!

but that episode was forgotten. now they sat there rejoicing over the newcomer. they all felt themselves to be shareholders in him, but they couldn't agree over the division. . . . the boy undoubtedly belonged to beret and per hansa--that was true enough and as it should be. but it didn't follow from this that they possessed the sole and only rights in him. had not sörine and kjersti stood by while the ship sank? now, hadn't they? hadn't they been the sponsors? did not godmothers have a strong claim on their godchildren? . . . and hadn't hans olsa been called out into the cold, grey christmas morning to take upon himself the holy duties of priesthood? it was he, indeed, who had poured the baptismal water and read the word

tasted a mouthful of food all day, and hadn't taken his trousers off all night! . . . tönseten refused to be set aside; in the midst of the company, with all his friends around him, he was less afraid of kjersti. a sudden fancy struck him--he began teasing sörine about the name. it was in his honour, of course, that the boy had been given that second name, and not in her honour at all! but tönseten should have been more careful in raising this issue. sam immediately struck in, insisting that per hansa must have taken the name from him--he had two names beginning with "s"!

. . . no, they could not agree over their claims. nor did they fare any better when it came to determining the newcomer's destiny.

henry, with an idea of eventually getting rid of his job, wanted the boy to be a schoolmaster. . . . but no, the godmothers wouldn't listen to the proposal. schoolmaster! as if that were good enough for such a boy! besides, they already had a schoolmaster. at this point kjersti lifted up her v

points in that direction."

this ridiculous fancy threw them into gales of laughter. but hans olsa did not join in the merriment; he remained grave and sat gazing thoughtfully at the wall. now he stretched, and said, as soon as he could be heard:

"i think we'll be more in need of a good governor out here, syvert; these prairies will be a state some day."

and there the discussion ended. all felt that at last hans olsa had proposed something that bore the stamp of good sense.

neither beret nor per hansa had taken part in this discussion. they sat listening to it, full of secret elation. . . . beret's cheeks burned; per hansa was on the point, once or twice, of putting in his oar, but managed to stop himself in time. . . . this was the proper occasion for him to hold his tongue. . . . what fun it was to hear them run on! . . .

no one knows what might have happened to them that winter if they had not had their school to fall back on. . . . but there it was--a great school, too, a ref

uge for them all.

at first it was held in the house of the solum boys, and the plan worked out very well. but then it occurred to sörine that they ought to find a more practical arrangement. henry might just as well conduct his school in her house; in which case both she and hans olsa could benefit by the instruction. and sam could come over, too. both the solum boys were pleased with the new plan.

a little later, when beret was quite well again, per hansa came one day to inquire if it mightn't be possible to move the school to his house every other week--for beret's sake. it would be interesting for her to listen to the instruction; and, besides, both of them needed to learn english. why couldn't henry teach his school just as well over there? . . . they all agreed that this was the thing to do.

but tönseten, as usual, wasn't quite satisfied with the arrangement; he felt that they weren't being entirely fair to him. so he proposed that they sh

 norwegian or english, making the children repeat them until they had been memorized. in this way they learned both the story and the language--such as it was. then he proposed to set them the task of writing words and sentences. a fine plan, if they only had something to write on and something to write with. . . . hans olsa made a large wooden slate for his girl, and gave her the last remaining stub of a carpenter's pencil which he had brought from norway. . . . and now that sofie had a slate, per hansa's boys must have something to write on, too. their father took the two thickest pieces of log that he had standing behind the stove, and whittled each into an object intended to be a writing board; but ole called his an ox yoke, because it was so heavy to carry around. for pencils they used nails and bits of charcoal. . . . but one day when store-hans went on an errand to kjersti's house, she had a present for him--a great bunch of folded paper bags and wrapping paper. . . . and in the chest sh

ould have to go east to the sioux river for a further supply of wood. the journey demanded great preparations and left little time for going to school. but it was decided that in spite of everything, henry must keep on with his teaching. since they couldn't leave the women alone under any circumstances, the school served as a good excuse for keeping him at home. he would have to be the guardian of the whole settlement while they were gone.

both tönseten and hans olsa thought it impossible for per hansa to make such a journey with oxen at this time of the year; they advised him to join forces with them. then they could all work together, and divide equally whatever they brought home. this sounded like good counsel, and per hansa made no objection to it at the time. but for a day or two he went about his work pondering deeply. before christmas he had made a sleigh, such as it was. one night he asked the boys to help him after school, and, taking the oxen out, he began to train them for halter-d

riving. heretofore he had used only the yoke, shouting "gee" and "haw," like everyone else in those days, who drove oxen.

he had bought his ox team in eastern minnesota the previous winter, from a swede who was glad to get rid of them because he wanted to buy horses instead. the swede had bought the oxen from an irishman in southern iowa, and no one knew how many other owners the team had had. the swede had called them "tom" and "buck," but per hansa had disliked the names. bound on a great voyage of adventure as he was, his boats had to be properly christened. so he had gone about thinking for a while, and at length had named the oxen "sören" and "perkel." to sören he had added the prefix "old," so that the full name of the animal was old sören.1 and sometimes, when he was in his very brightest mood, he'd prefix the same adjective before the other name, too, because that sounded more affectionate. this renaming was an easy process for t

 scratched the oxen's heads, they rode them like horses, and soon the animals would come trotting after whenever they caught sight of the boys; and as they stood patiently with the children hanging around their necks, giving them a good scratching, and saying "old sören" to one and "perkel" to the other, they must somehow have learned to associate this treatment with their new names, and the words must have sunk in. at any rate, the oxen always responded now when their names were called.

when per hansa that cold winter day took them out of the stable to teach them the new kind of driving, they were a pair of ragged and ugly-looking beasts. they stood in the snow before the sleigh and gazed dully over the white prairie, where the snow lay drifting. they didn't know what to make of their new harnesses. all went well for a while, but presently they lurched right into a snowdrift, and stood there motionless, sticking out their tongues and licking the snow. . . . this would never do! . . . ole sho

t forward and began scratching furiously; store-hans did the same on the other side; and when the oxen had thought it over long enough, and the commands from per hansa had taken on a brittle tone, they threw themselves forward into the harness and yanked the sleigh out like a feather, regardless of how deeply it had been lodged in the drift. they kept on training the oxen every day, and got a good deal of fun out of it into the bargain. . . . at last it had progressed so far that one evening, as they unhitched the team, per hansa said to the boys:

"there, they are working out splendidly. . . . now, if you two were worth your salt, you would take this outfit

and drive to the pacific coast for a load of fish for your mother and me!" the bays grinned and said nothing.

but per hansa had determined to make the trip to the sioux river with the oxen. that evening he was very high-spirited and happy. . . . as they were going to bed and beret was sitting by the stove tending the baby for the night, she said, "i suppose you must make this trip, then?"

"well, yes, i should say i must, if you and the newcomer aren't to freeze stiff!"

nothing more passed between them on the subject. again beret lay awake far into the night, turning her thoughts over in her mind.

this thing was t

her in a little knot to talk it over, wondering if it would be safe to chance it to-day. . . . well, yes, it looked all right now, speculated tönseten, peering into the sky and turning his quid in his cheek; but this sort of weather wasn't exactly dependable. somehow, it didn't seem natural for this time of year. . . . "it has too sweet a face, i think!"

they had better make a start, counselled hans olsa. already it was late in february; the spring thaw would soon be setting in.

"well," said per hansa, "if we have any idea of bringing a few sticks of wood home before the haying season begins, we'd better get a move on. . . . all the same, i agree with you, syvert. . . . it looks to me like a weather-breeder. but we ought to be able to reach the trönders' before anything happens."

then they began to get ready. there were numberless things to attend to, so that it was past ten o'clock before they set out. they had not burdened themselves with provisions, knowing that they would soon come to

hospitable folk; but to be on the safe side they all carried a small supply of food in their pockets.

the four teams formed quite a caravan, each with its own sleigh, trailing in single file across the white plain. hans olsa, who had the fastest horses, drove in the van; then came tönseten; then sam; while per hansa's oxen, shambling along with him and his sleigh, drew up the rear.

the whole settlement was out-of-doors to see the caravan set forth. the children were dismissed from school for a little while; the grown folks left their work. . . . store-hans clenched his fists in impotent fury. . . . what foolishness! . . . what an idiotic arrangement! here they had to sit indoors, he and his brother, in such fine weather, chewing over and over again the stories they knew by heart, while off went the men, b

knees trembling under her. . . . the window faced the east and they were going eastward, but she could not bring herself to look out. . . . but what she felt was not exactly fear--was not the same fear that had gripped her the time before when he had left her alone. . . . this was a sense of powerlessness. . . .

the caravan crept away. sleighs and animals grew smaller and smaller; at last they were nothing but tiny black dots on the endless white expanse of the plain. . . .

all went well with per hansa and the oxen. once the heavy animals had started, they kept the track without any difficulty, and didn't lag very far behind, either. the snow was soft, and it soon proved heavy, slow work to break the track. the three teams of horses had to take turns at it. though the weather still looked steady, the men pushed on as fast as they could.

some time after midday the breeze settled down into a mild south wind; the snow was growing more and more soggy under the runners; the air seemed as soft as

a may day; in the whole arch of the sky not a cloud nor the trace of a cloud could be seen; the sunshine almost blinded them with its radiant brilliancy.

this lasted without change until after three o'clock.

so far everything had gone without a hitch and per hansa figured that in two or three hours they would sight the hills over by the sioux river. but just then, chancing to glance back toward the western horizon, he caught sight of a black, billowy outline above the prairie, looming ominously against the sky. . . . were his eyes deceiving him? he rubbed them and looked again; rubbed them harder and gazed intently at the sight. . . . sure enough it was a veritable outline, the form of a low-lying dark cloud. . . . his heart pounded against his breast; h

of the onrushing cloud a bluish-black shadow had settled on the prairie.

the south wind suddenly died in fitful gasps, leaving a chill in the air. . . . a weird silence had fallen. . . . the thing in the west was possessed of baleful life. it shot outward and upward. . . . sighs as if out of a cold cavern ran before it. . . . in a twinkling, the day had been swallowed in gloom. . . .

those in the lead had stopped at the first warning. hans olsa had waited until tönseten and sam came up; when per hansa reached them, the three sleighs were all huddled together.

"it's going to strike us in a minute," said hans olsa, soberly. he was standing beside his sleigh, clearing the lashing-rope.

"looks like it," answered per hansa, dryly. "if we ever get out of this--!" . . . he jumped out and followed hans olsa's lead, clearing his own rope.

the solum boy said nothing, but worked frantically to get his rope untangled.

"this is what we must do," said hans olsa: "we'll pass a rope from sleigh to sleig

h, so that we won't lose each other in the storm. isn't that right, per hansa?"

"yes, yes!" his sailor instincts were all alive. "it looks as if the storm would travel the way we're going. we'll have to watch the wind. . . . whatever you do, keep a sharp lookout for the country we know on this side of the river. if we should sail past the trönders', there'll be hell to pay. . . . hurry up, now. damn the luck, that we haven't got a compass!" the words tumbled out of per hansa's mouth in a raging flood.

each man tied his lashing-rope to the sleigh, and gave the other end to the next one behind. per hansa ran forward to the solum boy:

"all ready, sam? are you sure your rope is fast? i don't believe i'll be able to keep up with you. . . . but listen: don't give a thought to what lies behind you! do you hear? hold on like hell to syvert's rope! it's a matter of life and death. do you understand? . . . now we must get a move on!"

both per hansa and hans olsa--old lofo

an arm's length ahead of them, a sucking noise, a few angry blasts, howling in fury, then dropping away to uncertain draughts of air that wandered idly here and there, swirling the light snowfall around the sleighs. high overhead, a sharp hissing sound mingled with growls like thunder--and then the blizzard broke in all its terror. . . .

the storm howled and whined, driving the snow before it like giant breakers. a grey-black spume enveloped them, a raging cloud. . . . instinctively, per hansa found himself peering through the murk, knitting his brows and squinting up his right eye--an old habit of his, born of the many times he had looked to see if the mast would hold!

a violent jerk came on his rope, so strong that he almost plunged forward. to save himself from being dragged off his sleigh he was forced to let go his hold. . . . "there goes sam!" he muttered, grinding his teeth together.

the boat that he steered was behaving very badly; it wouldn't answer the helm; it didn't rid

a seaworthy craft; it had no speed or power to lift itself over the rough waves. the oxen shambled and floundered along, veering before the wind; with every clumsy step they went more slowly; at last, with a great heave, they stood stockstill. drawing their heads as far as they could into their short necks, they twitched their bodies a little, hunched their backs, and lowered their heavy rumps into the snow, to meet the force of the gale. . . .

there they stood!

"god almighty!" . . . muttered per hansa into the storm. quick as lightning the thought flashed through his mind: run your knife into one of them, rip off his hide, wrap yourself in it, and let yourself snow under--it's your only salvation!

no, no, per hansa couldn't do that. old sören and perkel had brought him and his family all the way across the plains; they had broken every inch of his fields; if he were ever to have a lordly estate, it would come about through the labor of these beasts. . . . and old sören had such kind eyes,

 and perkel always came so quickly when they called him.

per hansa threw himself out of the sleigh and fumbled his way along the traces till he came to the oxen; he caught hold of their necks and began rubbing their foreheads. while he rubbed, he talked into their ears:

"now, old sören . . . now, damn you, perkel. by god, you'll have to be good boys!" . . .

with rough caresses he swept the snow off their backs, scratched their rumps a moment, then crept back into the sleigh. summoning all his force, he shouted in a mighty voice, "get along now, you devils!"

 the whip lashed and cracked--the first time since he had bought them that he had ever struck them in real earnest. . . . the oxen gave a tremendous plunge . . . another . . . and off they careered into the heart of the storm. per hansa felt as if he were sliding down one huge wave after another; the boat was scudding now with terrific speed! . . . still on they went, tossing and plunging, down and down! . . .

"will we ever climb the next wave?" thought per hansa.

. . . why, what in heaven's name was this? something had happened very suddenly. he thought that he heard a loud crash, as if two logs had smashed violently together; through the murk he glimpsed a black object flying across the bows and disappearing astern. . . . wasn't that another? and another? . . . why! . . . he must be passing the other teams!

"whoa! whoa, there!" he bellowed down the wind. "stop! . . . t-r-r-r-o!" . . . he was so angry that he nearly broke the lines. . . . "who ever s

aw such devils! stop! whoa!" . . .

but the oxen paid not the slightest attention to him. the spirit of the storm had possessed them; they tore along like mad things; whenever they struck a snowdrift, they plunged through it so furiously that the snow thrown up by their feet and the sleigh was thicker than that which fell from above. per hansa could do nothing but cling desperately to the sleigh. . . . this mad race through the inferno of the storm lasted a long time; how long he did not know, but it seemed to him as if it had gone on forever. . . .

but finally the oxen slackened their speed; the wild gallop sank to a trot; the trot fell to a tired jog . . . and then they stopped altogether. he could distinctly hear their exhausted puffing through the roar of the storm.

per hansa scrambled down from the sleigh again and managed to

the blanket, and wrapped it close around him. he emptied the hay sack and bundled it over his head. . . . then he shouted a few vigorous words of encouragement to the oxen: now they must get along--now, by god, they must show what stuff they were made of! . . .

but the beasts had a different notion, an idea all their own: instead of rushing off as before, they began to saunter slowly with the wind, moving forward at exactly the same speed as when they were drawing the plow on a hot summer day. per hansa tried every means he could think of to start them up; he fumed and swore; he coaxed them and used all kinds of pet names; he grabbed the whip and lashed them mercilessly, but everything had the same effect, or no effect at all. the oxen sauntered along, dragging him and his sleigh as unconcernedly through the storm as if they were on their way down to the creek to drink.

it had now grown pitch dark; the night pressed close about him. snow was not falling as thickly as in the afternoon, but the

the thought only made him impatient. . . . god almighty might have waited awhile longer, until they had seen how their luck would go out here and what sort of a boy permand would turn out to be. . . . it was a queer thing that he should want to be so cruel to beret--a sick woman left alone in this terrible place, so far out in the wilderness--and without the oxen, too! . . . a strange fate, this, i'll be damned if it isn't! thought per hansa.

. . . by and by he began to feel that he was really freezing. he tied the lines about his thighs and took to beating his arms. it helped his hands, but his back only grew colder; the wind cut through and through. . . .

. . . it seemed to him that by this time he must have gone by the trönders'--a long way by. the oxen wouldn't stop until they had reached the atlantic ocean! . . . he was so cold now that his teeth chattered all the time and couldn't stop.

. . . then, after a while, the cold

hat a blessed, infinite relief--to sit down here in this snowdrift and rest a little while! only a moment . . . it wouldn't take long . . . sleep would so soon overcome him.

suddenly he was aroused by a new thought that shook him wide awake and stirred his numbed senses: sam! what had happened to sam? they couldn't leave him in the lurch. . . . sam was a promising boy. he'd probably make a splendid citizen some day, with his fine voice and all his other good qualities. . . . god above, was he, per hansa, going to be blamed for this, too, that sam would lose his life to-night? . . . if he had kept his mouth shut that evening and let them go on their way, both sam and henry might now have been safe and sound in eastern minnesota with their own folks! . . . but perhaps those who had horses would be able to pull through, since the storm wasn't growing any worse. if only they didn't desert the boy!

steadily onward the oxen plowed, dragging per hansa by the arm. stumble and fall as he would, he had to get up again and struggle along. . . .

. . . what had happened now? the oxen had stopped--were standing still. per hansa wasn't being dragged forward any longer.

his first impulse was to sink down where he stood, to snatch a moment's peace, to give up to the weariness that was overmastering him. but deep down within him a voice commanded him to keep on standing. . . . he followed the lines, fumbled his way forward to perkel, flung his arm ac

what nonsense was this? . . . day breaking again? . . . between the heads of the two oxen a yellow eye seemed to be gleaming through the curtain of the driving snow . . . a great yellow eye. . . .

"it must be my death signal!" thought per hansa. "then i'm already across the boundary line!" . . .

suddenly old sören gave a long-drawn bellow. the sound had scarcely died away when perkel lifted his voice as if to second his comrade's motion. he put such a powerful effort into that bellow that his muscles strained and his whole body contracted. the noise shook per hansa out of his grim revery. he felt his way along perkel's back until he had reached the animal's head . . . it was rammed full-tilt against a log wall! . . .

per hansa trembled so violently that he could hardly keep his feet. he saw now that the eye shining through the drifting snow was in reality the light from a small window in this log wall. . . . good heavens! had he plowed and plunged clear through to fillmore county? . . . he found his way around the house corner, came to a door, flung it open without ceremony, and stumbled in.

per hansa saw nothing as he stumbled into the cabin. the heat of the room seemed to flow over him in a great wave, deadening all his senses. the light blinded him; he could not open his eyes beyond a narrow slit; his face was crusted with snow and ice; his eyelashes were frozen together. . . . but he was conscious, with a deep sense of joy and relief, that this was a safe place and that there were folk around him again--norwegian folk, his own people. . . . when he had first felt the build of the cornice

back, and let himself sink down. . . . his frozen clothes crackled like sheets of ice, shedding a little flurry of snow.

. . . "there, i'm tracking up your floor! . . . but look after the oxen--the oxen--"

a hubbub of confused, excited voices rose around him. he felt that there must be a crowd of people in the room, but their faces were all a blank to him. a thick haze seemed to surround them, swimming before his eyes.

then a person got up right by his side--a palpable figure confronted him. per hansa gave a start--the voice sounded strangely familiar.

"for the lord's sake! is this you, per hansa?" it said.

all at once per hansa burst into a laugh.

"where the devil did you drop from, syvert? . . . is sam with you?"

"can't you see the boy? . . . he's sitting in the chair right in front of you. . . . thank god, per hansa, you're still alive!"

no wonder that they had failed to recognize him, no wonder that he couldn't see, or that his voice sounded weak and strange, for his whole face was

covered with a mask of hard-caked snow which had not melted yet in the heat of the room. it was firmly fastened to his eyebrows and beard; it joined his cap to his coat collar and hung down behind over his back in a white sheet. if ever there was a snow king in human form, it was per hansa that night as he sat thawing out in simon baarstad's cabin.

little by little his five senses came back to him; and sure enough, there they all were, his good neighbours. he knew the room well, too, and the folk who owned it. . . . he could see sam plainly enough now--sam, who could sing so well, sitting close to the stove, beside a fair young girl. . . . he couldn't make out whether he was closer to the girl or to the stove. per hansa smiled to himself. . . . ah, sam, sam! . . . no doubt about

 your being a good man some day! . . .

he listened in deep contentment while hans olsa related how they had driven like demons, to save their lives. they had had no idea where they were going nor what lay ahead of them; but at the last moment, when they had almost given up hope, they had gotten their bearings of the country on this side of the river and had arrived at this very spot. that had been two hours ago; it was now past nine o'clock. . . .

per hansa heard them as if in a dream. the terrible trip didn't concern him any longer. it was all over now. . . . something else that was going on in the room interested him a great deal more: beside the stove stood gurina baarstad, handling a stewpan. she had filled it over half full of milk; when the milk began to simmer she added a goodly portion of strong, home-brewed beer.

"my dear, blessed gurina, don't be stingy, now!" per hansa teased her. the hot mixture was strong, brown, and frothy. they gav

e him a large bowlful; he drank and drank. . . .

"god, if a fellow had thirteen barrels of this stuff of yours, gurina! . . . you don't happen to have another little drop in the pan?" . . . she gave him a second bowlful, which he emptied as greedily as the first. . . . all at once, something occurred to him. he turned to ask a question. . . . had any of them seen him drive past them in the storm?

drive past them! . . . "you're talking wild, per hansa," said tönseten, with an anxious look. per hansa was off his base to-night!

--certainly not--nothing wild about that! they had better take a look at sam's sleigh to-morrow, if they didn't believe him. he had almost run sam down as he shot by . . . "say, didn't you see me, sam?"

well, sam remembered that he did see something go by--something black, that flew past like a wraith of the storm. it had been just after the squall broke. he had felt a terrific jolt go over the sleigh and thought he had struck a stone. . . . "was that you, per hansa

?"

"ha-ha! you're damned right! that was my flying oxen passing your good-for-nothing old plugs."

--but where, in heaven's name, had he been in the meanwhile?--asked everyone at once.

--yes, they had better wonder about that! . . . per hansa was gay once more; he tipped up the bowl rakishly and tried to squeeze another drop out of it.

"if you want to know, i took a little run up to flandreau to see if i couldn't find a good-looking bride for henry. i thought that was the least i could do for him, poor fellow. his brother can handle such matters for himself, it seems. . . . tell me, sam, are you still as cold as all that?"

sam blushed crimson and hitched his chair away from the girl.

later a large bowl of porridge was set out on

the table for per hansa, a mug of hot milk beside it. he ate and ate; it seemed as if he never could get enough. . . . afterward there was much cozy talk, everyone in the house joining in; they discussed all that had happened so far, and all that was going to happen. . . . oh, this country had a great future! people who were willing to work could win almost anything out of it! no doubt about that at all!

at last it came time for them to retire. the members of the family lay down in their beds; the strangers slept on

the floor, which had been piled deep with hay and covered with many thicknesses of clothes; all four men lay there side by side, and three of them soon slept the quiet sleep of the righteous. . . .

but per hansa could not sleep; his mind was numb with weariness, yet he could not sleep. every nerve of his body was twitching; little spasms passed over him, like ripples on the surface of a smooth, glassy sea. it was very hot in the cabin; the blanket grew so heavy that he had to throw it off. something remained still frozen, deep down in the centre of his being.

a certain picture stood stubbornly before his mind: a sod house beset by the western storm, a hut with the wind howling around the corners; he c

ould even hear the peculiar note that the wind always made as it sucked around one of these corners. the hut lay far, far out in the heart of the darkness. a woman was moving about there whose sad face was still full of beauty; she carried a child in her arms. per hansa's weary, wide-open eyes could see exactly how she held the child. . . . it lay wrapped in a blanket--a red blanket with black borders. . . . he turned over heavily many times, trying to blot out the vision; but the woman continued to pace up and down. he felt that he must speak to her, let her know that all was well--tell her to go to bed now, so that a fellow might have a little peace. . . .

. . . "god almighty!" sighed per hansa. "how beret must be worrying about me to-night! . . . she ought

w years! how they had had to cross the region that is now the southern part of south dakota and go still farther westward into nebraska, to have their wheat ground at the mill; how the indians had come by in large bands, both winter and summer; and all about many other remarkable things. . . . now there weren't any hardships or difficulties to be met with, said the trönders; now there were people everywhere, the country was fairly settled, and town after town had sprung up out of the prairie.

per hansa liked to listen to these stories. there was about them a certain flavor of genuineness and reliability, as of human experience, and at the same time something that stirred his heart and made his cheeks burn. . . . surely the things that a trönder could do were not impossible for a helgelænding! in olden times it had never been so, and it would not prove to be so to-day, either. . . . "just wait awhile!" . . .

the next day was clear and still, but bitterly cold. per hansa, who on his first tr

per hansa, when he had finished making up his load of wood, wanted to try his luck on the river. he coaxed baarstad until the latter consented to go with him. the two men went at it with a will, chopping their way through the thick ice, while the sweat rolled from their foreheads.

and then trönder and helgelænding fished together through the same hole, in the greatest comradeship and with the keenest enjoyment.1 . . . at night there was fresh fish on the table, and the two old fishermen sat eating and

 rejoicing while they told tales of both east and west lofoten and forgot everything around them as they went back into the past. per hansa thought that baarstad was the finest fellow he had met for many a long day, and baarstad felt the same way about per hansa. for the twentieth time now he had asked him not to wait too long before he visited them again.

 

1 during the winter seasons at lofoten, the two clans, the trönders and the helgelændings, had from time immemorial fought many a bitter fight.

 

as they sat there chatting, a boy came in to speak with the girl of the family. he seemed to be in hot haste, that boy--almost as if it were a matter of life and death.

--what was going on? asked baarstad.

--oh, tommaas had company at his house, a

nds of a scraping fiddle, mingled with the loud tramping of feet, poured out into the frosty night. the house was packed full of people, both young and old. . . . a small lamp with a homemade shade, sitting on a log well up on the wall, tried to keep an eye on all the couples below; but the task was too heavy for such a weak glim. it had to be content with blinking down on the nearest pair. . . . the three newcomers found themselves quickly shoved into a corner, out of the wake of the dancers.

per hansa grew restless as he watched, though his restlessness was far different from that which had kept him awake the other night. . . . remarkable how that fiddle sang! he had to admit that the man who played knew his business, even if he was a trönder! . . .

"well, i'll be--!" the exclamation had jumped out of per hansa before he could stop it. here came the solum boy, swinging past him with the baarstad girl! . . . "oh yes, he'll be a man, that sam, if he keeps this up!" . . . another couple came

"careful now, syvert, old man! there are rocks and breakers ahead of you! what do you think kjersti would--"

"shut your mouth, per hansa! what are you standing there moping about?" tönseten's face was fiery red; the dance whirled him away before he had time to say anything more.

per hansa began to breathe hard and fast; his eyes snapped with excitement, narrowing to little slits. right in the midst of a flock of dancers a big head bobbed up and down, up and down, above all the others, like a buoy on a high sea. . . . then per hansa completely forgot himself. "by all the frolicking seraphims, there's hans olsa dancing the schottische!" . . . waves of spasmodic twitching passed over him, in time to the jigging tune; his eyes blinked rapidly. . . . he looked around for the baarstad

sunday afternoon . . . a dim, lurid day . . . a pale sun flickering through the drifting snow . . . an everlasting wind . . . the whole prairie a foaming, storm-beaten sea. . . . nothing else, to the very ends of the world. . . . the sun dogs were still on guard, one ahead of the sun, the other following. . . .

the whole settlement was gathered in tönseten's hut that afternoon; a gloomy restlessness had taken hold of them, so that they could not stay at home. per hansa had bundled the newcomer up and taken him over; that completed the roll call. . . . kjersti was serving potato coffee, with potato cakes; but for the coffee to-day she had fresh cow's milk, which made it not so bad, and her store of loaf sugar wasn't entirely gone. . . . inside the hut the lurid daylight cast a pale, sickly gleam. from out the stove, with its crackling fire, bright streamers of warmer light played about the room.

a heavy mood lay on the folk--too heavy for potato coffee to dis

ould turn up another year? they began to figure it out on this basis: next year so many, in four years such a number; until at last the country would be filled up and the folk would stretch, neighbour to neighbour, clear out to the rocky mountains! they foresaw the whole process and calculated correctly--but no one in that company believed in the calculation! they heard themselves speak, and listened to one another, but all realized that there was no fire in their words. . . .

"i don't believe per hansa is ready himself to swallow that story," thought hans olsa, but he raised no objection. . . . "god save them from making mistakes in their figuring!" ran through kjersti's mind, as she listened in awe to per hansa and syvert rolling up the total; but she was careful to throw no cold water on the dream.

. . . on a day like this it was impossible to believe in such fine fancies; they all felt it, deep down in their hearts.

but here came tönseten with a question that made them forget everything

 else for a while. the conversation had died of its own inertia; no one could find a thought that seemed worth expressing. then tönseten straightened up where he sat on the chest, demanding to know what names hans olsa and per hansa intended to adopt when they took out the title deeds to their land.

"names?"

"yes, names! . . . that point would have to be settled clearly beforehand," tönseten explained. "when the deeds were taken out, their names would then be written into the law of the land, and thereafter would be as unchangeable as the constitution itself!"

. . . but they all had been baptized! how about tönseten himself? asked per hansa, irritably. he couldn't understand why the name peder hansen would not be good

ntry. hence the many american names now ending in --dahl, --fjeld, --gaard, --stad, etc. as the swedes, and the danes, too, had so many hansens and olsens and johnsons, the change was really a very practical one.

 

hans olsa laughed good-naturedly, and said with quiet humour: "then perhaps i had better call myself olav trygvason. . . . wasn't there some one of that name?"

this made everyone laugh: hans olsa's shaft had suddenly torn a rift in their mood of depression.

"well, well," chuckled per hansa, "if you want to be olav trygvason, i'll be peter tordenskjold! but then we'll have to rechristen syvert, too . . . st. olaf or tore hund.2 how would that do, hans olsa? . . . if that wouldn't proclaim to both jew and gentile that we are good norwegians, then i'm certainly up a stump!" . . .

s. but beret sat quietly rocking the baby on her lap, and said nothing.

an earnest liveliness crept into the conversation. opinions flew thick and fast. at last sörine spoke up resolutely, as if she had made up her mind, saying that if she had her choice she would rather be called mrs. vaag, from their place name in norway, than mrs. olsen.

this sounded so sensible and practical that all the others had to try the idea at once, with their own place names.

"but, look here, sörrina," objected per hansa, "that wouldn't do for my wife! your notion would make her mrs. skarvholmen3--and that nobody shall call her! i warn you!"

 

3 skarv in this compound means cormorant--a rather nasty-looking sea bird; the word is often used in an adjectival sense about a deadbeat or person of low moral qualities. holmen means the holm. hence skarvholmen--the holm of the cormorant.

 

"no, that certainly wouldn't do for a christian woman!" cried kjersti with a hearty laugh.

"no, i suppose not," admitted söri

erence to her. sörine grew serious over this point. "i agree with you, beret. . . . but here in this country we can't bear our fathers' names, anyway. it wouldn't do for me to sign my name as sörine sakkarias'-daughter!"

"no," cried tönseten, excitedly, "not if you want to be hans olsa's wife!" . . . remarkable what a bright head sat on sörrina's shoulders!

this matter of names brought on a long discussion. hans olsa, like the others, decided that his wife had made a practical suggestion; per hansa found little to say, but his face had a look of quiet elation. . . . he must speak to beret about this, alone and right away! . . . he sat there trying the name over in his mind, first on her, then on himself, finally on each of the children. as he ran them over, the radiant light in his face grew stronger. . . . mrs. holm, that sounded well; peder holm, that had a fine ring! . . . ole haldor holm! . . . hans kristian holm! . . . peder holm--no, peder victorious holm! . . . peder victorious hol

m! . . . he rolled the name on his tongue, biting it off in three distinct parts, as if to enjoy the sound; then he got up suddenly, grasped the waistband of his trousers, and gave them a hitch.

. . . "sörrina has got it right--that name is both pretty and practical. what do you say, boys--shall we adopt the plan?"

per hansa was plainly in a towering humour now; the note of it rang in his voice. there was no opposing him. . . . after that day, each of the two families in question had a pair of surnames. among themselves they always used the old names, but among strangers they were vaag and holm--though hans olsa invariably wrote it with a "w" instead of a "v."

 

that night beret sat quietly by herself. the chores were long since done and they had eaten their supper. the children were in bed. they had been very no

isy tonight, in their excitement over the new name that sörine had invented for them. but now they were all asleep. per hansa was getting ready to go to bed; he moved about abstractedly and took a long time over everything he did. he, too, was full of excitement, thinking about the name. . . .

peder victorious holm--the words sang through his mind; he seemed to expand as he heard them. the song carried him forward into the great, imaginative future where he loved to dwell. . . . "beret, please come to bed!" he begged, in a low, kindly voice. he caressed his wife affectionately, then went to the bed and lay down.

the days were growing longer with every one that passed. march came, and the winter seemed to be letting up a little. per hansa worked with a desperate energy. if the day was too short for what he was doing, he simply added a part of the night to it. and in the month of march he achieved something that is still told about in the legends of that settlement.

every time he had visited the trönders at sioux river, he had heard fascinating tales about the indians at flandreau, where they had a large colony. their whole winter occupation was trapping, from fall frost to spring thaw, and when spring came they would have larg

n occasional wolf. they sold the skins wherever they could find a market, and took whatever they could get; but their best prices were no more than a fourth of what the same skins would bring in eastern minnesota. the price of a muskrat skin was ten cents in this district--never more than ten cents; while in austin, minnesota, it would sell for as high as fifty cents. . . . a few people along the river had taken to buying furs from the indians, and shipping them into minnesota.

all these facts per hansa had heard more than once, and he brooded over them a good deal. throughout the winter they had been constantly on his mind, but he had said nothing about it to anyone. now march had come, there must be a great supply of furs stored up at flandreau, and prices would be running high in minnesota. . . . the railroad ran east from worthington. . . . every day he went about thinking of it; at night he slept with the idea; and all the while he grew more silent and irritable.

there were many things t

for he was much more mature than his brother. . . . but that would close the school. . . . and if everyone went, there would be a terrific protest; the women were all more or less timid and naturally didn't want to be left alone. . . .

no, he couldn't seem to hit on the right solution. . . . but it was a thundering pity for that money to lie right at his door--and he in need of another quarter-section of land, with numberless things besides! . . .

the first week of march went by.

one morning per hansa got up a little earlier than usual and looked out at the weather. . . . turning to beret, he said that this couldn't go on any longer, and stood waiting for her to ask what it was that couldn't go on any longer. . . . but as she made no reply, he had to take up his own story. seeding time would soon be here--and he hadn't a penny in the world. . . . they needed many other things, a great many, both food and clothes. . . . it was time for him to think of some way of earning a few extra dollars.

et away! if he would only think of the fact that others felt the same desire!

. . . "when are you going?"

. . . "well now, beret, i hadn't made up my mind. but if you think it's all right, i'd better set out to-day! i'm going to take the pony that the indian gave me. the weather looks steady enough. . . . you'll have to take good care of that newcomer of ours!" . . .

this last remark might better have been left unsaid, thought beret bitterly; but still she made no answer.

half an hour later per hansa took his departure.

late at night he reached flandreau, found his way into a hut, and so saved his life for that night. . . . as soon as he had fed the pony the next morning he took it along with him and poked around the village to interview the indians. he searched every face; but the one he was looking for and hoping to find was not among them. the savages watched him curiously, returning his stares. they recognized the pony, and seemed to know who per hansa was, too. he noticed this quickly
 
 ___________________________
 
 "this scheme is going to work out all right," he thought. . . . then he followed the plan that he had formed long ago when he had first begun to think about it. trusting wholly to his instincts, he selected out of the crowd the face that he liked best, beckoned the indian forward, and uttered the one word, "fur." as he did this, he gazed inquiringly into the man's face, but kindly, too, as if to inspire confidence in him.

the indian understood at once. of course he had plenty of furs! he took per hansa into his wigwam and showed him several bundles of fine muskrat skins. . . .

per hansa laughed at his success. with the stick he carried in his hand he wrote the figures "10" in the snow, and after them the word "cents." then he drew an object which was meant to be a man with a bundle on his back. he pointed first to the drawing, then to the figures, and at last made a vigorous gesture toward the indian; this amused him very much, and he couldn't help smiling as he went through the motions. but
 
 ___________________________
 
 all the honesty of his heart managed to come out in that smile, and the indian saw it. . . . a long period of bargaining followed, with many gestures, and much drawing and writing to be done in the snow. the upshot of it was that he bought as many furs as he judged he would be able to carry away. he arranged them in four bundles and hung them pack-fashion over the pony's back. . . . per hansa was still laughing when he left flandreau.

"well now, forward, in god's name!" he said to himself, steering his course toward the southeast, in the general direction of a hut where lived a couple of hallings who used cows for breaking prairie.

he was gone for a whole week on this expedition. when at last he reached home he refused to tell how far he had travelled into minnesota, or what experiences he had met with on the way. he was worn out and disturbed; such tales had better be left untold

 where folks were so easily frightened. . . . but he had brought home many of the things they needed--and even so, there were forty dollars left in his pocket! these he gayly counted out on the table for beret, thinking to amuse her.

he remained at home two days. on the third day he left again. . . . "understand, beret, i've got to go and pay the indian for his furs! . . . now, don't expect me until you see me heave in sight!"

all together, per hansa made three such journeys; the last two took him only six days each; if there hadn't been other pressing things to attend to, he probably would have made a fourth journey. when it was all over he was able to lay one hundred and forty dollars on the table for beret; besides this, he had brought things for the house on each trip--things that he knew she went about wishing for.

he had returned from the last journey with two frozen toes. these were giving him a good deal of trouble when he and the

 acted differently if she had known, for instance, how he had ridden one time until he had nearly fallen from his horse with fatigue! and once or twice he had escaped death by a pretty narrow squeak--he had thought that his time had come. but then--better not tell her such things! . . . if she would only say something brave and tender to him! . . . "ah, well, she would probably be in better spirits when spring and fine weather set in!" . . .

per hansa and the boys sat around the table, sifting the seed; the wheat lay spread in small heaps on the white cloth. this was important work and must be done with the greatest care; every little weed seed and other foreign substance had to be gleaned out. the seed must be clean, so the trönders had cautioned per hansa; and now he was attending to it soberly, with infinite pains. if he found a shrunken or damaged kernel, he straightway threw it out--thank you, not that! the best only for new soil! . .

. full kernels will make the bin bulge. . . . "be careful, boys! be careful, there! don't shirk your job!"

it was wonderful to be sitting here playing with these plump, precious kernels; never before had per hansa been so absorbed in a task of this kind, yet it made him thoughtful, too. . . . here, then, was the start! these few sacks of grain would not only supply him and his family with all the wheat flour they needed for a whole year, but would raise many bright dollars as well, a great store of riches. . . . and more than that, seed for the next year, seed again for the year after, and thus down through all the years to come. . . . and always greater and greater abundance of food for the poor, the wo

 spring weather set in, a feverish restlessness seized him; the work on the seed was done and he could not stay indoors. . . . the chickens were laying finely now; he was finding as many as five eggs a day. they'd better begin setting the hens pretty soon; when fall came, they would have at least fifty fowl on the place! . . . next minute he was over on the prairie, talking to and caressing the oxen, and feeling of their necks where the yoke would lie. . . . now if the ground would only dry up! per hansa looked at it the first thing in the morning, and felt of it every night before he went to bed. to-day it had made fine progress. good god--if the sun would only shine as warm to-morrow! . . . he dashed off to the neighbours, to see how the ground was coming on there. no, it was wetter than at his place, where the land lay higher. . . . i'll bet my land is going to be the first to dry up! he told himself.

beret hadn't seen him in such good spirits since last spring. he walked so lightly; everyt

 she felt a force that made her tremble, emanating from him; she tried to keep out of his way as much as she could.

and now the sun bore down on the prairie the whole live-long day. bright and quivering in the forenoon, he swam through endless seas of blue; across the hazy afternoon he beamed caressingly; toward evening he opened wide his countenance; then the flood of light grew refulgent, only to die in splendour against a mysterious night which also had life.

as the fine weather continued, per hansa became more restless, but it only seemed to fill him with greater joy. suddenly he would be up by the field. wasn't it dry enough yet? . . . he ought to have had the seeding all done by now; it was high time to begin breaking new ground.

on the 14th of april, the sommermaalsdag of his old fatherland, per hansa began seeding the wheat. three times that forenoon he had been out to test the ground; the last time he made his great decision: now we will start!

no sooner had he finished the noon me

al than he rushed out, grabbed the seed bag that he had made for this occasion, and carried two sacks of seed up to that portion of the field where the ground was driest. he had paced off the whole field into one-acre lots, and marked each plot. one and one-half bushels of seed to the acre was the regular measure; but simon baarstad had told him that on really first-class breaking, provided the soil was unusually excellent, one and one-quarter bushels might do; and per hansa had decided to try the latter amount.

he filled the seed bag, hung it over his shoulder, and was ready. his whole body shook. he paused for an instant and glanced about the settlement. . . . yes, sir, he was the first, the very first one! there was hans olsa hauling manure to his garden patch. . . . that's smart of you, hans olsa! . . . down to the southward he caught sight of tönseten pottering around his yard. . . . so much for you! . . . then he turned to look in a northerly direction. . .
 
 ___________________________
 
 . by god, if the solum boys hadn't already started breaking! . . . muttering, "well, well, well," he strode over to the edge of the field and stuck his hand into the bag.

but just at that moment both boys appeared on the dead run; they had discovered what their father was up to, and wanted to watch the show.

"go home!" shouted per hansa. "go home! do you hear me?"

"why can't we stand here and watch?" the boys remonstrated, their faces gloomy with disappointment.

"go home this instant! . . . i don't want you tramping around here, carrying off this precious seed on your shoes!" . . . he suddenly realized that it was very wrong of him to be so harsh with the boys in an hour like this. when he spoke again, his voice had grown kinder: "sowing wheat is such a particular job--each kernel has to lie exactly the way it falls. be good
 
 ___________________________
 
 now, boys, and go straight home--and the first to wake up to-morrow morning shall start the dragging! i'll see to it that one of you covers as much ground as the other--but the first to wake shall start!" . . . with this promise the boys had to be content; they went off homeward in a rebellious mood.

again per hansa thrust his hand into the bag and his fingers closed on the grain. he felt profoundly that the greatest moment of his life had come. now he was about to sow wheat on his own ground! his hand tightened in the bag; he was on the point of lifting it out, when something queer happened--the kernels were running out between his fingers! he gave another grab, closing his hand still tighter; again the yellow kernels slipped through his fingers like squirming eels. then per hansa threw back his head and

laughed. these fellows aren't very anxious to go into the ground after riches for me! . . . he ran his hand around in the bag, stroking the grain caressingly, taking great handfuls and giving them a gentle squeeze.

. . . and now the wheat rained down in yellow semicircles from per hansa's hand; as the seed fell, the warm rays of the sun struck full across it, and seemed to wrap it in golden light. . . . per hansa restrained himself, working slowly and carefully--the seeding must be even and not too thick. but almost at once he grew very heated; his body was dripping with sweat. he couldn't explain this for a while; it wasn't hard work at all. oh, well, he thought at last--that's always the way when you tackle a job you don't understand!

late in the afternoon tönseten came running up the hill, so hard that his heels seemed to be flying over his head.

"what in hell are you starting here, per hansa?" he
 
 ___________________________
 
 demanded, breathlessly.

"can't you see?" laughed per hansa; but he hardly dared to look at his neighbour, for fear he would lose his marks.

tönseten stared at him in amazement. "you're plumb crazy, man, and i don't mind telling you so! . . . the ground isn't half dry enough yet for that--the soil is too cold! why, damn it all, there's a foot of frost in the ground! . . . much good it will do you to throw away all that seed!" . . . into this last, tönseten threw all the scorn of the man who really knows; in fact, he felt too seriously disturbed to ut

ter another syllable; so, having done his duty and delivered his ominous message, he turned on his heel and stalked majestically away.

as long as the daylight lasted, per hansa kept on seeding. . . . after supper he sat at the table without moving; he didn't want to get up; a pleasant feeling of languorous exhaustion had settled on him, the reaction from his excitement. and-ongen crawled up into his lap and begged for a story, but got no response; the boys came storming in, demanding that he call them both at the same time to-morrow morning. . . . no, he said in a dreamy, abstracted voice, that wouldn't do; there wasn't any hurry; better let the sun have time to warm

up the ground a bit before they covered the grain. but the bargain still held; the one who turned out first, yoked the oxen and hitched them to the drag, he was to start the dragging! "and now," he added, rising from the table, "i'll tell you this, boys--if we are any good at all, we'll have the whole field seeded and dragged by the time the porridge is on the table to-morrow night!"

the next day per hansa worked like one possessed. now that he had at last caught the trick with the seeding, he made fine progress. when evening fell that day he had finished his task, while the boys had done almost as well, with only the oats left to drag. . . . per hansa walked home that night in great satisfaction. now he had turned a fine trick--he was through seeding and dragging before his neighbours had even thought of beginning the regular spring work! . . .

ased, but the snow only came faster; the flakes were firmer now, and fell in a businesslike manner. before long a veritable blizzard was raging over the whole prairie--there had hardly been anything worse that winter.

throughout that day and the following night the storm continued with unabated fury. early on the next morning the weather cleared; but now the cold was so intense that it nipped the skin as soon as one stuck one's head out-of-doors. spring seemed a thousand miles off.

that night per hansa did not sleep a wink. how could he sleep, with this tragedy going on? he was nothing but an old sailor; he didn't know the least thing about farming. god almighty! hadn't he good reason to lie awake? . . . here he had gone to work and wasted all his precious seed--had simply thrown it away, because he was foolish and hasty! and there wasn't even a chance to extricate himself from the mess he had made! out in the field, under the snow, lay all that priceless wheat, smothered to death and frozen

in the afternoon the sun shone strong and brilliant, but the cold was too intense for it to make any impression on the snow. . . . per hansa was still lying in bed; the bright sunshine outside, reflecting on the white walls of the room, seemed to sear his eyeballs; he felt that the only thing that would give him relief would be to get up, strike out wildly, and curse everything around him--for he was fighting an unseen enemy. . . . he had come to his great decision; he had done the seeding; he had felt clearly that it was the most momentous day of his life; but no sooner had the last kernel fallen to the ground than the very powers

of heaven had stepped down to defeat him! . . . powers of heaven . . . ? a certain image came before his eyes, and would not go away. one sunday not very long ago, store-hans had sat by the table reading to his mother; per hansa remembered it vividly, because the words had sounded so awful to him. at last he had gotten up to look over the boy's shoulder; store-hans was reading in a loud voice, throwing great emphasis into the words:

"and the lord said unto satan, whence comest thou? then satan answered the lord, and said, from going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. . . ."

the words would not go away. per hansa fell to repeating them. . . . and that night as he lay wide awake, tossing restl

ry little water; within a short while the ground was drier than before. . . . and now came days when the warm, bright sunshine filled everything between heaven and earth. as the sun sank, he left part of his heat behind him; the nights grew soft and balmy, and stirred with mysterious life. . . . at length evenings so sweet and beautiful began to visit the prairie, that, as the saying is, dead men might willingly step out of their graves and walk about. but all this could not alter the fact that per hansa's precious seed grain lay over there in the field, ruined by frost and snow--those marvellous, pregnant kernels, so delicate and sensitive. . . . damn the luck! . . .

one day as per hansa was pottering about out-of-doors, hardly knowing which way to turn, he caught sight of tönseten, who had commenced his seeding. like a condemned man about to be executed per hansa walked over. . . . tönseten is an aboriginal american, he thought, bitterly. i might as well let him polish off the damned fool

of a newcomer!

but to-day tönseten was too busy even to talk. per hansa didn't feel inclined to open up the subject of his own troubles; he began on a different tack, to head the other off:

"i must say you certainly sow it even!"

tönseten spat a prodigious distance. . . . "you think so?" . . . but he didn't stop for a moment; his arms continued to cut wide semicircles in the air; golden grain flew out of his hand and rained down to the ground through the warm sunlight, there to begin the mystic dream of life.

this is beautiful! thought per hansa. . . . i couldn

't sow it as even as that.

"i was a fool for not waiting to get you to do the seeding for me," he observed.

tönseten spat another great mouthful before he answered:

"well, some people are bound to cut off their nose to spite their face. . . . but then--this is a free country, you know!" . . . he walked on with measured steps, his arm sweeping in long, graceful curves; the kernels flew far and wide, catching the sunlight a moment as they fell.

per hansa turned abruptly, and began to walk toward home. when tönseten noticed this, he stopped his work and called out:

"did you want anything, per hansa?"

''hell--no!"

"all right. to-day, you see, i'm a busy man!"

per hansa started to answer, choked, and continued to walk away. his head was in a whirl as he went on toward his own field, which seemed to be making faces at him as he drew nearer; it was indeed a forbidding, countenance that he saw there, lifeless and black and bare. reaching the fie

ld, he fell on his knees, dug into the soil, and picked up the first kernel he came across; he laid it in the palm of his left hand and turned it over and over with the forefinger of his right; the seed was black with clammy dirt, which clung tightly to it. slowly and carefully he picked off the particles of soil--and there it lay, a pale little thing, greyish-white and dirty, the golden sheen through which he had read the fairy tale, entirely gone, the magic departed, the seed cold and dead. per hansa dropped it without a word, and dug in the ground until he had found another kernel. the one he now picked up had the same lifeless color, but it was swollen and seemed about to burst open. . . . "this is the frost!"--he mumbled, hoarsely.--"it's all begun to rot!" . . . he rose to his feet and stood there as if chained to the spot, the very personification of gloom, gazing out over the face of his dead dream. . . . "then satan answered the lord, and said, from going to and fro in the earth, and

over on the piece of field which per hansa had broken during the last few days the boys were now busy at work with the dragging. he had set them to the task early that morning, but had not yet made up his mind what to put into the field. now he walked over to them.

one of the boys was driving; the other sat on the harrow, making grooves with his heels in the loose dirt; on each round of the field they exchanged places. they had quarrelled considerably over who could drive the straightest; now they were trying to decide this momentous q

we can't get less than thirty cents a bushel, can we? i'll be able to help you haul them to town. and that'll be exactly one hundred and eighty dollars. gee! what a lot!" the boy looked proudly at his father, and added with a grown-up air, "we ought to get the potatoes planted at once--that's my opinion!"

but then store-hans had a great inspiration, and flashed out:

"when we get as much money as that, just for potatoes, we'll buy a shotgun. hurrah!"

"stop your nonsense and get to work!" said per hansa, harshly. "you need a pair of pants to cover your bottom, more than you do a gun. . . . move on, now, i tell you!"

on the way home that morning, per hansa realized one thing more clearly than ever before--unless he could find something to occupy his body and mind, and find it right away, he would go all to pieces one of these fine days. . . . well, why not do as ole suggested? here was this piece of new field, and it had to be put to some use. . . . if that fellow was loose around these parts,

 per hansa might as well give him a run for his money! . . .

the minute per hansa reached home he opened the root cellar and began carrying out potatoes. he took out all that he judged they could possibly spare and began to cut them up into small pieces; he was determined to have enough seed to cover the whole field. . . . oh yes, no doubt this was insanely foolish, too, but, damn it all, he might as well come to ruination at once and be done with it! . . .

the planting kept the three of them busy for the rest of that week. when sunday morning came, per hansa rose at the us

suddenly a violent stamping of feet sounded outside; some one came running up, with another close at his heels.

ole jerked the door open, took one leap, and landed in the middle of the floor. the boy was wild-eyed with excitement.

"per hansa!" he cried, calling his father by name. "the wheat is up!" then he took another leap and stood leaning over the bed. "the wheat is up, i say! . . . can't you hear me?" . . .

but now store-hans came storming in, all out of breath:

"father per hansa--the wheat is so high!"

"you shut up!" raged his brother. "i came first!"

"i guess i can tell it, too!" store-hans paid no further attention to his brother; he was standing now by the bed, measuring on his finger. "the wheat is so high, the oats a

bout up to here! . . . don't you suppose we can buy a shotgun?"

per hansa said never a word; he got up, trembling in every limb, and put the child aside. in a moment he had left the house and rushed up to the field. there he stood spellbound, gazing at the sight spread before him. his whole body shook; tears came to his eyes, so that he found it difficult to see clearly. and well he might be surprised. over the whole field tiny shoots were quivering in the warm sunshine.

store-hans was standing now by his father's side; he looked at him in consternation.

"are you s

no answer.

"why, you're crying!"

"you're . . . so--foolish, store-hans!" per hansa was blowing his nose violently. . . . "so terribly foolish!" he added, softly, and straightened himself up with a new energy.

store-hans now began to feel reassured about his father. the boy turned to the field and spoke in a voice thrilled with delight:

"isn't it dandy?"

the silence continued for a while longer. but at last his father cleared his throat. "come here, store-hans!" per hansa placed his hand on the boy's shoulder. "what are you going to be when you grow up?"

"when i grow up?" repeated the boy, wonderingly. "well, a general . . . one like grant."

per hansa looked at him, a strange chuckling sound issuing from his throat:

"what about being a minister? . . . we need a minister more."

"oh, well," said store-hans, indifferently. "i suppose i can be that, too. . . . don't you think we can get a shotgun pretty soon?"

per hansa was a different man when he walked home;

r much, for they could be washed; but it would be more serious to have to explain the tattered shirts. the boys fought it out, however; finally the newcomer had to admit that truth is truth and take back all he had said. this mollified store-hans; he let the other boy try the pony, and they became friends. but the same evening he had to tell the incident to his father; after the nose had been washed and properly cooled, it had taken on alarming proportions, which called for an explanation; this per hansa got as he sat on the woodpile, smoking his evening pipe, with store-hans standing near by.

all the new settlers that spring, with the exception of torkel tallaksen, built sod houses; but he had vaster plans in mind. he set up a tent, hitched his four horses to the breaking plow, worked like a beaver, and soon had broken a big field, considering the fact that he had just arrived. he had brought seed enough with him to plant the whole area. rumours began to spread in the settlement about his pla

ns; when he was done seeding he proposed to go to worthington after lumber; both his living house and barn were to be built this summer. . . . per hansa listened to these rumours and cocked his head on one side, but made no comment.

one day just as they were sitting down to the noon meal at per hansa's, torkel tallaksen swaggered in and asked in a loud voice if he could hire per hansa and the oxen to go to worthington with him for building materials? all the other neighbours were going, too. . . . "you folks have been here so long now, and have got such a good start that you can afford to lend a hand to a poor devil who is just starting in! i need all the critters that can crawl, with me. i'll pay you in either work or cash--but i prefer cash, for then it's over with! . . . no, thank you, i'm not going to sit down; i just stepped in on my way to your neighbours'. . . . fine

 anyway? . . . good lord! not more than that in a whole year? . . . well, i'll give you a tip--oxen aren't any good; they're too slow for the way things go nowadays. . . . fine-looking house you've got, inside, but sod houses aren't much better than dugouts--in some ways, really not so good. . . . for my part, i am through with such poor makeshifts. . . . well, can i count on you, then?" . . . tallaksen referred to this trip as airily as if he were asking for a match.

"are you going to build?" per hansa asked, quietly.

"you bet i am. isn't that what i've been telling you? if i'm to stay here, i intend to live like a human being!" . . . and now he began outlining his building plans and explaining them at length. . . . "oh yes, there's a lot to do before i get everything ready; but i intend to hire plenty of help and get it done in a jiffy. see? i've come out here to break prairie, i want you to know. . . . if crops turn out decently this year, i'll snap up one more quarter by fall, or perhaps

two. really"--here the man grew confidential--"i don't see any nameable reason why a smart man couldn't farm a whole section of land like this--or even more. why, you've only got to put the plow into the level prairie! . . . but first of all, i want to build a decent house; the painting i'll let go until fall." . . . his voice flowed on in such a steady stream that no one else could get in a word edgewise.

"you're going to paint?" per hansa asked, and got up from the table abruptly. he was breathing fast.

"paint? why, certainly! it would never do to let a house stand unpainted in this climate. it wouldn't look well, either."

a look of innocent curiosity rested on beret's face as she listened to the great plans being unfolded before her. she seemed lost in thought, and asked in a quiet tone if it were really true that he intended to build a home like that--now, at once, this summer? it would be a fine thing, she added--and there

was a note of wistful gladness in her voice--to see a real house once more. it would make the desert look brighter. . . .

at that torkel tallaksen had to laugh outright; he had never seen such a houseful of moles! here he had been explaining till he was hoarse, but apparently they hadn't understood one word of it! what was the use of wasting more breath on them? . . . he turned to go.

"well," he said to per hansa in an important voice, "can i count on you for the trip?"

per hansa paused over his answer. they were all looking at him inquiringly when he spoke:

"it seems to me," he began, quietly, "that you are starting from the wrong end." again he paused, for he found it hard to choose his words. "if you would take the money that you intend to spend in building and put it into cattle and horses and machinery, and hire help enough to run them, then the devil himself couldn't keep up with you. in a few years you'd be the king of all of us--though god knows we'd much rathe

r have another. but this i tell you, now"--prophetic power rang in per hansa's voice--"if you start from the other end and do as you've been proposing, then you and i will fight--yes, you and i!--for both the scepter and the crown . . . though all i've got now, god knows, is a pair of pants and a yoke of oxen!" . . .

torkel tallaksen laughed overbearingly. "one doesn't need to live in a gopher hole, in order to get ahead! . . . here, too, will have to come decency and civilized living."

the words stung per hansa like a whip lash; in his effort to control himself he fe

t can stand up and be seen; people won't need to wonder whether this is a settlement or a gopher camp!" suddenly a fresh idea seemed to strike him: "perhaps you'd like to help my wife weave a few carpets? she's all the time talking about carpets, and i suppose she must have 'em. . . . they save the floors, too."

"i would be glad to try," said beret, humbly. "one ought to help another get what she cannot have for herself. . . . i think it would be interesting work."

as he listened to his wife, per hansa was fumbling in his pocket for another match; at last he brought it out, struck it on the table, and held it until it burned down to the end. the room was swimming before his eyes; words floated across his vision--words that he longed to use, he reached out for them, but they melted into the air; what beret had said had driven them away. . . . per hansa sat down heavily on the chest, his face pale and drawn.

"all right--that's settled, then!" said torkel tallaksen. then he turned to per hansa:
 
 ___________________________
 
 "we start the day after tomorrow. i'm counting on you, remember--you and the oxen. . . . you'll be needing some one to haul for you pretty soon, when you once get on your feet."

silence fell on the room. the man stood there, waiting for an answer.

"you'd better count over again!" per hansa growled. without another word he sprang up from the chest and left the house. in a gruff voice he called to the oxen. that day he kept on breaking as long as he could see. when he unhitched at last he walked in slowly from the field, stooping over in thought; he could hardly bring himself to going home. what business had he there--what earthly business? . . . the sod house and all it contained lay in a great darkness, yet he was drawn toward it irresistibly. . . .

. . . perhaps it was true? wh

self was no good. . . . a thought cut him to the very quick: "that's the reward you get for fighting and striving--she says you are no good!" . . . to think that she hadn't felt ashamed, that she had been willing to lay bare her troubles to that infernal blabberer and braggart! . . . had she lost all sense of propriety? . . . "oh, hell! get up, there!" he ripped out to the oxen.

but as it transpired, torkel tallaksen's great plans ran up against a snag. tönseten didn't care to go along unless per hansa went, for he was fully occupied with his own affairs. and the solum boys were not overly enthusiastic; they were busy breaking prairie when tallaksen came, and answered him that they would see how the others felt about it, and let him know. it finally developed that torkel tallaksen could engage only two men and two teams, which weren't enough to haul home all the materials for a whole farmstead. and so, in the face of the inevitable, torkel tallaksen had to give up building for that summer. .

e wagon crossed her view. when she brought in the milk, she remarked in her quiet manner that they were going to have company, at which tidings the rest of the family had to run out and see who might be coming at this time of day.

there was only one wagon, with two cows following behind; on the left side walked a brown-whiskered, stooping man--he was doing the driving; close behind him came a half-grown boy, dragging his feet heavily. the wagon at last crawled up the hill and came to a stop in per hansa's yard, where the whole family stood waiting.

"i don't suppose there are any norwegians in this settlement? no, that would be too much to expect," said the man in a husky, worn-out voice.

"if you're looking for norwegians, you have found the right place, all right! we sift the people as they pass through here--keep our own, and let the others go!" . . . per hansa wanted to run on, for he felt in high spirits; but he checked himself, observing that the man looked as if he stood on the very bri

nk of the grave.

--was there any chance of putting up here for the night?

"certainly! certainly!" cried per hansa, briskly, "provided you are willing to take things as they are."

the man didn't answer, but walked instead to the wagon and spoke to some one inside:

"kari, now you must brace up and come down. here we have found norwegians at last!" as if fearing a contradiction, he added: "ya, they are real norwegians. i've talked with them."

on top of his words there came out of the wagon, first a puny boy with a hungry face, somewhat smaller than the other boy; then a girl of about the same size, but loo

king much older. she helped to get down another boy, about six years old, who evidently had been sleeping and looked cross and tired. that seemed to be all.

the man stepped closer to the wagon. "aren't you coming, kari?"

a groan sounded within the canvas. the girl grabbed hold of her father's arm. "you must untie the rope! can't you remember anything?" she whispered, angrily.

"ya, that's right! wait a minute till i come and help you."

an irresistible curiosity took hold of per hansa; in two jumps he stood on the tongue of the wagon. the sight that met his eyes sent chills running down his spine. inside sat a woman on a pile of clothes, with her back against a large immigrant chest; around her wrists and leading to the handles of the chest a strong rope was tied; her face was drawn and unnatural. per hansa trembled so violently that he had to catch hold of the wagon box, but inwardly he was swearing a steady stream. to him it looked as if the woman was crucified.

she came down unsteadily. "is this the place, jakob?" she asked in a bewildered way. but now beret ran up and put her arm around her; the women looked into each other's eyes and instantly a bond of understanding had been established. "you come with me!" urged beret. . . . "o god! this isn't the place, either!" wailed the woman; but she followed beret submissively into the house.

"well, well!" sighed the man as he began to unhitch the horses. "life isn't easy--no, it certainly isn't." . . .

per hansa watched him anxiously, hardly knowing what to do. both the boys kept close to him. then an idea flashed through his mind: "you boys run over to hans olsa's and tell him not to go to bed until i come. . . . no, i don't want him here. and you two stay over there to-night. now run along!"

turning to the man, he asked, "aren't there any more in your party?"

"no, not now. we were five, you see, to begin with--five in all--but the others had to go on. . . . haven't they been by here yet? well, they

 must be somewhere over to the westward. . . . no, life isn't easy." . . . the man wandered on in his monotonous, blurred tone; he sounded all the time as if he were half sobbing.

"where do you come from?" per hansa demanded, gruffly.

the man didn't give a direct answer, but continued on in the same mournful way, stretching his story out interminably. . . . they had been wandering over the prairie for nearly six weeks. . . . ya, it was a hard life. when they had started from houston county, minnesota, there had been five wagons in all. strange that the others hadn't turned up here. where could they be? it seemed to him as if he had travelled far enough to reach the ends of the earth! . . . good god, what 
 
 ___________________________
 
a nightmare life was! if he had only--only known. . . !

"did the others go away and leave you?" per hansa hadn't intended to ask that question, but it had slipped out before he realized what he was saying. he wondered if there could be anything seriously wrong. . . .

"they couldn't possibly wait for us--couldn't have been expected to. everything went wrong, you see, and i didn't know when i would be able to start again. . . . turn the horses loose, john," he said to the boy. "take the pail and see if you can squeeze some milk out of the cows. poor beasts, they don't give much now!" then he turned

to per hansa again: "i don't know what would have become of us if we hadn't reached this place to-night! we'd have been in a bad hole, that i assure you! women folk can't bear up. . . ." the man stopped and blew his nose.

per hansa dreaded what might be coming next. "you must have got off your course, since you are coming down from the north?"

the man shook his head helplessly. "to tell the truth, i don't know where we've been these last few days. we couldn't see the sun."

"haven't you got a compass?"

"compass? no! i tried to steer with a rope, but the one i had wasn't long enough."

"like hell you did!" exclaimed per hansa, excitedly, full of a sudden new interest.

"ya, i tried that rope idea--hitched it to the back

of the wagon, and let it drag in the wet grass. but it didn't work--i couldn't steer straight with it. the rope was so short, and kept kinking around so much, that it didn't leave any wake."

"uh-huh!" nodded per hansa wisely. "you must be a seafaring man, to have tried that trick!"

"no, i'm no sailor. but fisher-folk out here have told me that it's possible to steer by a rope. . . . i had to try something."

"where did you cross the sioux?"

"how do i know where i crossed it? we came to a river a long way to the east of here--that must have been the sioux. we hunted and hunted before we could find a place shallow enough to cross. . . . god! this has certainly been a wandering in the desert for me! . . . but

ce had grown even more blurred and indistinct: "physically she seems to be as well as ever--as far as i can see. she certainly hasn't overworked since we've been travelling. i hope there's nothing wrong with her. . . . but certain things are hard to bear--i suppose it's worse for the mother, too--though the lord knows it hasn't been easy for me, either! . . . you see, we had to leave our youngest boy out there on the prairie. . . ."

"leave him?" . . . these were the only two words that came to per hansa's mind.

"ya, there he lies, our little boy! . . . i never saw a more promising man--you know what i mean--when he grew up. . . . but now--oh, well. . . ."

per hansa felt faint in the pit of his stomach; his throat grew dry; his voice became as husky as that of the other; he came close up to him. "tell me--how did this happen?"

the man shook his head again, in a sort of dumb despair. then he cleared his throat and continued with great effort: "i can't tell how it happened! fate just willed it

with the boy--i could see that plainly enough. . . . ya, well--so we started again. . . . it isn't any use to fight against fate; that's an old saying, and a true one, too, i guess. . . . before long we saw that the boy wasn't going to recover. so we hurried on, day and night, trying to catch our neighbours. . . . well, that's about all of it. one night he was gone--just as if you had blown out a candle. ya, let me see--that was five nights ago."

"have you got him there in the wagon?" demanded per hansa, grabbing the man by the arm.

"no, no," he muttered, huskily. "we buried him out there by a big stone--no coffin or anything. but kari took the best skirt she had and wrapped it all around him--we had to do something, you know. . . . but," he continued, suddenly straightening up, "paul cannot lie there! as soon as i find my neighbours, i'll go and get him. otherwise kari . . ." the man paused between the sobs that threatened to choke him. "i have had to tie her up the last few days. she insist

ed on getting out and going back to paul. i don't think she has had a wink of sleep for over a week. . . . it's just as i was saying--some people can't stand things." . . .

per hansa leaned heavily against the wagon. "has she gone crazy?" he asked, hoarsely.

"she isn't much worse than the rest of us. i don't believe . . . kari is really a well-balanced woman . . . but you can imagine how it feels, to leave a child that way . . ."

the boy, john, had finished milking. he had put the rail down and was standing a little way off, listening to his father's story; suddenly he threw himself on the ground, sobbing as if in convulsions.

"john! john!" admonished the father. "aren't

 you ashamed of yourself--a grown-up man like you! take the milk and carry it into the house!"

"that's right!" echoed per hansa, pulling himself together. "we'd better all go in. there's shelter here, and plenty to eat."

beret was bustling around the room when they entered; she had put the woman to bed, and now was tending her. "where are the boys?" she asked.

per hansa told her that he had sent them to hans olsa's for the night.

"that was hardly necessary; we could have made room here somehow." beret's voice carried a note of keen reproach.

the man had paused at the door; now he came over to the bed, took the limp hand, and muttered: "poor soul! . . . why, i believe she's asleep already!"

beret came up and pushed him gently aside. "be careful! don't wake her. she needs the rest."

"ya, i don't doubt it--not i! she hasn't slept for a week, you see--the poor

n more comfortable; she loosened her clothes, took off her shoes, and washed her face in warm water; during all this the stranger never stirred. that done, beret began to fix up sleeping quarters for the strangers, in the barn. she carried in fresh hay and brought out all the bedding she had; she herself would take care of the woman, in case she awoke and needed attention. beret did little talking, but she went about these arrangements with a firmness and confidence that surprised her husband.

per hansa came in from the barn, after helping the strangers settle themselves for the night. beret was sitting on the edge of the bed, dressing the baby for the night; she had put and-ongen to bed beside the distracted woman.

"did she tell you much?" he asked in a low voice.

beret glanced toward the other bed before she answered:

"only that she had had to leave one of her children on the way. she wasn't able to talk connectedly."

"it's a terrible thing!" he said, looking away from his wife. "i think

he bed, with the baby asleep on her lap. they sat in silence for a long while; at last he began to undress. she waited until he was in bed, then turned the lamp low and lay down herself, but without undressing. . . . the lamp shed only a faint light. it was so quiet in the room that one could hear the breathing of all the others. beret lay there listening; though the room was still, it seemed alive to her with strange movements; she forced herself to open her eyes and look around. noticing that per hansa wasn't asleep, either, she asked:

"did you look after the boys?"

"nothing the matter with them! they were fast asleep in sofie's bed."

"you told them everything, at hans olsa's?"

"of course!"

"what did they think of it?"

per hansa raised himself on his elbows and glanced at the broken creature lying in the bed back of theirs. the woman, apparently, had not stirred a muscle. "it's a bad business," he said. "we must try to get together a coffin and find the boy. we can't let him lie out the

re--that way." . . . as beret made no answer, he briefly narrated the story that the man had told him. "the fellow is a good-for-nothing, stupid fool, i'm sure of that," concluded per hansa.

she listened to him in silence. for some time she brooded over her thoughts; then in a bitter tone she suddenly burst out: "now you can see that this kind of a life is impossible! it's beyond human endurance."

he had not the power to read her thoughts; he did not want to know them; to-night every nerve in his body was taut with apprehension and dismay. but he tried to say, reassuringly: "hans olsa and i will both go with the man, as soon as the day breaks. if we only had something to make th

ed over to it. she seemed to recall dimly that some one had recently gone out. hadn't she heard it in her sleep? beret went through the door and stood in front of the house, but did not dare to make an outcry; she listened intently, then called in a low voice; getting no answer, she ran around the house, peering hither and thither, but the grey morning light disclosed nothing.

running back into the house, she called her husband distractedly: "she's gone! get up! you must hurry!"

in an instant per hansa was up and had tumbled into his clothes. "run over to hans olsa's and tell him to come at once! be as quick as you can! in the meanwhile i'll search down by the creek."

when they came out, the first light of day was creeping up the eastern sky; a slight fog floated along the creek; the morning air was crisp and cool. per hansa leaped up into the seat of the wagon and scanned the prairie in every direction. . . . what was that, over there? wasn't it a human being standing on the top of the hill

? could she have taken that direction? . . . he jumped down from the wagon, and rushed around to the other side of the house, called to beret, and pointed up the hill. instantly they both started out on the run.

the woman did not seem in the least surprised at their coming. when per hansa had almost reached her, he stopped stone dead. what, in god's name, was she carrying in her arms? his face blanched with terror. "come here!" he shouted. in a moment he had the child in his own arms.

and-ongen was almost awake now and had begun to whimper; things were going on around her that she could not understand; she felt cold, and father had such a queer look on his face. sleepily she cuddled up in the fold of his left arm, her cheek against his heart, though a hard hand which seemed to

per hansa went up and spoke to her, his voice sounding hoarse and unnatural. "come with me, now! to-day hans olsa and i are going to find your boy." taking her gently by the arm, he led her back to the house. . . . it's very kind of him, to help find paul, she thought, and followed willingly.

at breakfast she sat very quiet; she ate when they bade her, but never spoke. while they were making the coffin she sat looking on, wondering why they didn't hurry faster with the work. couldn't they understand tha

as soon as the coffin was ready, per hansa and hans olsa, along with the stranger and his wife, left the settlement to hunt for the body of the dead boy. they took quite a stock of provisions with them. on this search they were gone four days; they criss-crossed the prairie for a long way to the east, and searched high and low; but when they returned the coffin was still empty.

after the return from the search the strangers stayed one more day with them. the morning they were to leave it looked dark and threatening, and per

hansa wouldn't hear of their setting out; but along toward noon the sky cleared and the weather appeared more settled. the man, very anxious to be on his way, had everything loaded into the wagon, and as soon as the noon meal was over they were ready to go.

but before the man got on his way per hansa asked him where he intended to settle.

--well, he wasn't positive as to the exact place. it was over somewhere toward the james river--his neighbours had told him that.

--did he know where the james river was? per hansa inquired further.

--certainly he did! how could he ask such a foolish question? the river lay off there; all he needed to do was to steer straight west. after finding the river, of course he'd have to ask. but that part of it would be quite easy. . . .

the wagon started creaking; the man, short and stooping, led the way; the family piled into the wagon; the two cows jogged behind. . . . they laid their course due west. . . . banks of heavy cloud were rolled up

ce always hovering above the plain. to beret, as she watched, it seemed as if the prairie were swallowing up the people, the wagon, the cows and all. at last the little caravan was merged in the very infinite itself; beret thought she could see the wagon yet, but was not certain; it might be only a dead tuft of grass far away which the wind stirred. . . .

she took the children and went home, walking with slow, dragging steps; she wanted to cry, and felt the need of it, but no tears came. . . . per hansa and the boys were breaking prairie; to judge from the language they used in talking to the oxen, they must be hard at it. her loneliness was so great that she felt a physical need of bringing happiness to some living thing; as soon as she got home she took her little remaining store of rice and cooked porridge for supper; the boys were very fond of that dish.

toward evening the air grew heavy and sultry; the cloud banks, still rolling up in the western sky, had taken on a most threatening aspe

after supper per hansa was due to meet at hans olsa's with the other neighbours, to lay plans for the trip to town which had to be made before harvesting set in. the boys asked leave to go, too--it was so much fun to be with the men.

when she had washed the supper dishes beret went outdoors and sat down on the woodpile. a nameless apprehension tugged at her heart and would not leave her in peace; taking the two children as before, she again ascended the hill. the spell of the afternoon's sadness was still upon her;

 . vague premonitions hovered about her like shadows. many times she was on the point of asking her husband if he saw what she did, towering above the prairie out west; but always she seemed to be tongue-tied. . . . well, why mention it? couldn't he and the others see it perfectly well for themselves? how could they help it? . . . she noticed that a silence would often fall upon them when they were out-of-doors, especially in the evening. certainly they saw it! . . . every evening, now, whether per hansa was away or at home, she hung something over the windows--it helped shut out the fear. . . .

at first her husband made all sorts of fun of this practice of hers; he teased her about it, as if it were a good joke, and continued to force his caresses on her, his voice low and vibrant with pent-up emotion. but as time went on he ceased laughing; the fear that possessed her had begun to affect him, too. . . .

ning and made a brave showing. never had one seen finer fields! the grain had started to head out long ago; the kernels were already formed, tiny bodies wrapped in the most delicate green silk. with every day that passed the wheat filled out more and more; the heads grew heavy and full of milk; as soon as the breeze died down in the afternoon, they would tilt toward the setting sun and slowly drop off to sleep, only to dream of the marvellous life that was now stirring within them.

these days, per hansa was behaving like a good boat in a heavy sea--as long as the keel pointed the right way, he would go on. he watched his wife covering the windows at night, and felt both sad and angry; but when he saw how everything was growing on the farm--meadows and fields, cattle and youngsters--then he was filled with an exultant joy that made him momentarily forget his wife's condition. he had a larger field than any of his neighbours, and there wasn't a doubt that his grain was the finest--theirs was jus

t ordinary dumb grain, while his seemed alive! . . . he tried to reason himself out of his serious misgivings over beret. true enough, she didn't act as a normal person should; yet it was nothing that wouldn't naturally right itself with time. perhaps he would go to work and build her a house this fall. by thunder, he'd have to see about that! the castle would have to be tackled sooner or later. . . . the lumberman at worthington was a fine fellow, and per hansa wouldn't be ashamed to ask him for credit. huh! what could the man expect to do with his lumber but sell it? . . . next spring he would make a big haul in his fur trade with the indians; he'd buy every damned scalp they had in the place. and when his castle was ready it would be stranger than the devil if such a sensible girl as beret didn't perk up and throw off her gruesome fancies!

everything he had planted that spring was blooming like a garden. why, he could just hear the potatoes grow! a

 of course, but their joy at the sight of the wheat was written all over their faces. . . . damned fine people, these irish. too bad he couldn't talk with them. but he felt like showing his appreciation of their visits in some tangible way, so he would go over to the potato patch, dig into a row, and give them enough for a meal. . . . good god! a man as well off as he was must lend a hand to a pack of starving devils! . . .

by this time tönseten had lost the last vestige of ill-feeling toward per hansa for doing his own seeding; he was even willing to praise the other for having had sense enough to get the seed into the ground good and early. now they would be able to cut and harvest the wheat here before the other fields had ripened. . . . "i tell you what, per hansa, that's the most sensible thing you ever did in your life--and i ought to know what i'm talking about!" . . . tönseten's round, fat body bristled with importance, for, of course, it would fall to him to do the reaping for these

eenhorns. the solum boys would have to teach them how to bind. damn it, he couldn't be expected to do everything! . . . yes, syvert tönseten was a very busy man these days. there was the reaper to overhaul, and the harnesses to be mended; he had to keep a sharp eye on the grain, too, lest they let it stand too long. such heavy wheat would shell easily! so he waddled back and forth between the houses of his three neighbours, invariably finding some important matter to discuss wherever he went.

per hansa was not running true to form these days; he who was always so easily excited and never had patience to wait when something had to be done, seemed in no hurry to start his harvesting. every evening he would make a trip up to the field, to see how the wheat was coming on, and with each trip his mind was more at ease. "come up with me and see how fine the wheat stands!" he would coax beret. and beret would usually go; she would agree absent-mindedly that the grain looked fine--of course it did; bu

t then she would always remember some task she had left undone at home and would have to hurry back before dark; she seldom seemed to have time to wait for him.

. . . "no, no, there's no hurry yet with the wheat!" per hansa thought. when tönseten insisted that it was time to start cutting he would argue with him: "no, syvert brother, we'll leave the wheat awhile yet--give her a spell longer to think it over. you'll be able to do the reaping easily enough before the others need you. don't we all know that your equal in running the reaper isn't to be found in the whole of dakota territory?"

tönseten would give an embarrassed cough: "you mean perhaps in minnesota?"

"certainly! wasn't that what i said?" whereupon

gh like a couple of happy boys.

but one forenoon tönseten came over in great excitement, declaring flatly that now they would have to start cutting here--and no use talking! he had just come from hans olsa's, where he'd been looking at the field; and there, too, the grain was ripening fast. this job had to be gotten out of the way right now, or where the devil would they be?

"oh, what's your hurry, syvert? don't let's get excited; we'll just give her one more night for extra measure!" argued per hansa.

then tönseten grew goggle-eyed, waving his arms as he talked. "you're a stubborn, ignorant fool, per hansa--i don't mind telling you so! no, i'm damned if i do! here we have eighty acres of grain, and i alone must do all the cutting! in all probability i'll have to help the east-siders, too; they don't seem to have any more brains than they need--some of 'em don't, at least!"

"take it easy, take it easy, syvert! don't you see how nicely the wheat is filling out--just like a young girl buddi

ng into womanhood?"

at that tönseten got mad in earnest. "you make me tired, man! you don't know as much as the nose on your face--no, you don't! what the devil would happen to us if all our grain came in at the same time? just what would we do, i'd like to know? we couldn't save it. . . . now i've made up my mind: there's to be no more damned shilly-shallying. we start this afternoon, and that's the end of it!"

"as you say, captain!" answered per hansa, meekly, his eyes twinkling.

"all right, then. i'll tell hans olsa. you run over and tell the solum boys."

per hansa chuckled aloud. "are you going to call in all of dakota territory to help harvest this little patch of mine?"

"stop your joking, per hansa! you don't know an earthly thing about harvesting in america--no, you don't! you and hans olsa couldn't any more take care of the binding, when i once get going, than you could fly! you don't even know what needs to be done; you've never se

en a job of binding in your life! . . . now do as i tell you and get the solum boys!" . . . tönseten spoke as if the welfare of the whole country were resting on his shoulders. his neighbour only laughed still harder and did as he was bid.

the moment the noon meal was over, the whole of the little settlement assembled at per hansa's wheat field, men, women, and children; beret had brought and-ongen with her, and even carried the baby in her arms. tönseten's shouts and numberless commands put everyone but himself in a festive mood; he felt it to be a solemn occasion, and highly disapproved of the way they took it; but the others only laughed and joked as gayly as if they were in a bridal procession on the way to church, some bright sunday morning. some one would think of a funny remark, which straightway would cause some

ve anything along the edge; he was too much taken up with this momentous task even to see the others. but when he had finished the fourth round of the field he felt that he was master of the situation. stopping the machine, he called in english to henry solum--how was he getting along? could he pound any sense into those idiots? well, kjersti had been a smart binder in her day. why didn't he get her to help him with the instruction? . . . and then, turning majestically in his seat, he addressed per hansa:

"if this wheat doesn't run forty bushels to the acre, i'll eat my own shirt! by god, i will! . . . well, anyway, thirty-five . . ."

"you go on with the cutting, brother!" chuckled per hansa. "here's a whole army waiting for something to do! . . . go on, i say. we'll measure it up later."

all were working; all were having a good time. for the greenhorns the binding proved to be more like work than art; they soon caught on to the trick; there were so many of them at it that the binding this a

lt that she had to come over and speak to her. there wasn't any need of that, she said; the men could easily handle what had to be done. heavens and earth--five grown men and two boys in a field no bigger than this! beret and sörine had better go home and get a lunch ready, kjersti advised further; the menfolk were never happier than when they had coffee brought to them in the field. she knew them! . . . after a while the two women followed her advice and went home to make their preparations!

per hansa was in a rare mood that afternoon. now he was binding his own wheat, his hands oily with the sap of the new-cut stems; a fine oil it was, too--he rubbed his hands together and felt a sensuous pleasure welling up within him. his body seemed to grow a little with every bundle he tied; he walked as if on springs; a strength the like of which he had never felt before ran through his muscles. how good it was to be alive! he had made a daring throw, and luck had smiled on him! . . . he tied the ripe,

 them he laughed to himself joyously, stopping a second as he finished each one to draw his hands over his face. . . . he must handle these bundles with care--the heavy kernels might shell out. . . . how absurdly light-hearted and gay he felt to-day! . . .

the men continued working until the dew became so heavy on the wheat that the reaping machine refused to go; it was long after sundown before they quit. tönseten felt stiff and tired, but he wasn't announcing the fact from the housetops. in per hansa's hut stood a table heaped with many good things, though the porridge bowls predominated. both kjersti and sörine had been home to do their own chores for the night, and had returned to help beret with the supper.

the men were already seated at the table; but they waited for per hansa, who had his head in the big chest and was hunting for something or other. "hold on a minute, boys, before you say grace," came from the cavernous depths of the chest. "haven't you manners enough to wait for the

 head of the family?" . . . when he finally emerged and came up to the table, he shook a bottle behind tönseten's ear, asking, gayly, "did you ever hear a sweeter sound, syvert? can't you just hear her wink at you, my boy?" . . . there was enough in the bottle for one round, and then a little drop to swallow on, before the meal started.

tönseten cleared his throat after the drink; he was anxious to make a little speech:

"what do you plan on doing in the future, per hansa, if you're going to get rich on the very first crop? . . . i never in my life saw such wheat! why, the kernels are like potatoes!"

"how about yourself, then?" inquired per hansa in great good humour. "i like to help worthy people who are in trouble; in case you and kjersti should run short of stockings to keep your money in, you might come to me!"

as the meal went on, the spirits of the men sitting about the table rose higher and higher, and each vied with the other in good cheer.

"rich?" ex

f cool weather should last, the wheat would profit by yet another week; but then they might prepare to harvest a crop unique in the history of wheat growing.

tönseten felt highly well pleased with himself and the rest of the world; he had now proved his prowess before his neighbours; the field was almost finished here, and it wouldn't do any harm to rest and visit awhile. . . . "don't fret, boys, i won't need to hurry at all! those four acres of oats will only be play for the afternoon!"

and per hansa felt very much the same way. he and the other men were sitting in the shade on the north side of the house, with their backs up against the wall, enjoying the cool breeze that had sprung up from the west. . . . what was the use of hurrying? . . . per hansa had told the solum boys that he wouldn't need them that afternoon, as he and hans olsa could easily bind the oats; but it was so pleasant to rest here and spin yarns that the boys didn't feel like stirring until the others went to the field.

as they got up at last and returned to their work, the northwest breeze struck them full in the face with its cool, fresh fragrance; tönseten sniffed it approvingly, declaring that if this weather kept on, he and hans olsa would be sure to steal a march on per hansa in the end; never had the lord sent finer weather for wheat to ripen in! he chuckled and talked away, his rotund body bobbing up and down with an irresistible merriment. . . . "well, boys, in my opinion the land of canaan didn't have much on this country--no, i'm damned if it had! do you suppose the children of israel ever smelt a westerly breeze like this? why, folks, it's blowing honey!" . . . his festive mood was still possessing him as he began to hitch up the horses; in the midst of it he

had to turn around and ask them shyly, "now, wasn't it remarkable that i should discover just this place for you?"

hans olsa burst into a laugh. "yes, it surely was wonderful, syvert!"

but tönseten felt that this praise wasn't enough--he wanted to carry the joke a little farther. turning to his other neighbour, he asked with the same roguish air, "what did you say, per hansa?"

per hansa remained strangely silent; he was standing a little distance away, shading his eyes with his light hand and looking into the west; an intent, troubled expression had come over his face.

. . . "what in the devil? . . ." he muttered to himself. off in the western sky he had caught sight of something he couldn't understand--something that sent a nameless chill through his blood. . . . could that be a storm coming on?

he hurried over to the wheat shock where hans olsa was sitting, pointed westwar

d, and asked in a low voice, "tell me, can you see anything over there?"

hans olsa was on his feet in an instant. . . . "well, look at that! . . . it must be going to storm!"

tönseten had finished hitching the horses to the reaper, and had just mounted the seat when he saw per hansa run over, pointing to the west. now both his neighbours were shouting at him: "what's that, syvert?"

tönseten turned in his seat, to face a sight such as he had never seen or heard before. from out of the west layers of clouds came rolling--thin layers that rose and sank on the breeze; they had none of the look or manner of ordinary clouds; they came in waves, like the surges of the sea, and cast a glittering sheen before them as they came; they seemed to be made of some solid murky substance

tubble, on everything in sight--popping and glittering, millions on millions of them. . . . the people watched it, stricken with fear and awe. here was another one speaking! . . .

kjersti was crying bitterly; sörine's kind face was deathly pale as she glanced at the men, trying to bolster up her courage; but the big frame of her husband was bent in fright and dismay. he spoke slowly and solemnly: "this must be one of the plagues mentioned in the bible!"

"yes! and the devil take it!" muttered per hansa, darkly. . . . "but it can't last forever."

to tönseten the words of per hansa, in an hour like this, sounded like the sheerest blasphemy; they would surely call down upon them a still darker wrath! he turned to reprove his neighbour: "now the lord is taking back what he has given," he said, impressively. "i might have guessed that i would never be permitted to harvest such wheat. that was asking too much!"

"stop your silly gabble!" snarled per hansa. "do you really suppose he needs to take

the bread out of your mouth?"

there was a certain consolation in per hansa's outburst of angry rationalism; kjersti ceased weeping, though it was her own husband that had been put to shame. "i believe per hansa is right," she said, the sobs still choking her. "the lord can't have any use for our wheat. he doesn't need bread, anyway. he certainly wouldn't take it from us in this way!"

but her open unbelief only confirmed her husband in his position; clearing his throat, he began to take kjersti to task: "don't you remember your catechism, and your bible history? isn't it plainly stated that this is one of the seven plagues that fell upon egypt? look out for your tongue, woman, lest he send us the othe

tönseten would probably have gone on indefinitely expounding the scriptures to his wife if henry solum hadn't interrupted just then with a practical idea. turning to his brother, he said, "go fetch the horses, so we can finish this field; by to-morrow there won't be anything left!"

per hansa looked at henry and nodded approvingly; the simple practicability of the suggestion had touched the chord of action again; he jumped to his feet and walked across to the field, where the work of devastation was already in full progress. as he saw the fine, ripe grain being ruthlessly destroyed before his eyes, he felt but one impulse--to stop the inroads of these demons in any possible way. he began to jump up and down and wave his hat, stamping and yelling like one possessed. but the hosts of

t over himself. "you, ola!" he shouted, hoarsely. "run home after old maria, and bring the caps!"

the boy was soon back with the old musket. his father, hardly able to wait, ran to meet him and snatched the weapon out of his hands. hurriedly putting on a cap, he settled himself in a firm foothold--for he still had sense enough to remember how hard the rifle kicked when it had been lying loaded a long time.

as hans olsa caught wind of what he intended to do he tried to stop it. "don't do that, per hansa! if the lord has sent this affliction on us, then . . ."

per hansa glowered at him with a look of angry determination; then, facing squarely the hurricane of flying bodies, he fired straight into the thickest of the welter! . . . the awful detonation of the old, rusty muzzle-loader had a singular effect; at first, as the shattering sound died away, nothing appeared to have happened--the glittering demons flickered by as unconcernedly as before; but presently a new movement seemed to originate

 body of the main cloud; it began to heave and roll with a lifting motion; in a few minutes the cloud had left the ground and was sailing over their heads, with only an intermittent hail of bodies pelting down on them out of its lower fringe; the roaring becoming more muffled.

"do you suppose you've actually driven them off?" cried henry, breathlessly, marvelling as he watched.

"yes, from here!" said hans olsa in the same solemn tone, as he pointed down the hill. "but see our fields . . . !"

per hansa was still in the grip of the strange spell that had taken possession of him; he apparently did not hear what the others were saying; without looking again he hurried off to help sam with the horses. "let's get the reaper started!" he cried. "no sense in sitting here like a row of dummies!"

his example roused them once more, and without further words they followed his lead; just before sundown that night they finished the oat field at per hansa's. all the while fresh clouds of marauders were pa

ole and store-hans went home with hans olsa to bring back word as to whether it would be possible to start harvesting his field in the morning. per hansa walked home alone; the spell had lifted now, and the reaction had left him in a troubled, irresolute frame of mind. the things that had happened that afternoon seemed harsh and inexplicable. . . . to be sure, he had saved his whole crop--but how and why? he had saved it--partly because of his own foolish, headstrong acts, and partly because his land chanced to lie so much higher than that of his neighbours, that it had been the first to dry out in the spring. . . . well, great luck for him! but

he found himself listening intently, his ears strained to catch the least sound; at length he thought he heard a movement inside, and a great wave of relief swept over him.

per hansa had begun to shove against the panel.

once more he listened; once more he caught a faint sound; but the blood pounding in his ears deafened him now. pulling himself together, he shoved against the door with all his strength--shoved until red streaks were flashing before his eyes. the door began to give--the opening widened; at last he had pushed it wide enough to slip through.

. . . "beret!" . . . the anguish of his cry cut throu

no answer came--there was no one to be seen. but wasn't that a sound? "beret!" he called again, sharply. he heard it now distinctly. was it coming from one of the beds, or over there by the door? . . . it was a faint, whimpering sound. he rushed to the beds and threw off the bedclothes--no one in this one, no one in that one--it must be over by the door! . . . he staggered back--the big chest was standing in front of the door. who could have dragged it there? . . . per hansa flung the cover open with frantic haste. the sight that met his eyes made his blood run cold. down in the depths of the great chest lay beret, huddled up and holding the baby in her arms; and-ongen was crouching at her feet--the whimpering sound had come from her.

it seemed for a moment as if he would go mad; the room swam and receded in dizzy circles. . . . but things had to be done. first he lifted and-ongen out and carried her to the bed--then the baby. at last he took beret up in his arms,

he gazed at her helplessly, imploringly; she returned the gaze in a fixed stare, and whispered hoarsely:

"hasn't the devil got you yet? he has been all around here to-day. . . . put the chest back in front of the door right away! he doesn't dare to take the chest, you see. . . . we must hide in it--all of us!"

"oh, beret!" begged per hansa, his very soul in the cry. speechless and all undone, he sank down before her, threw his arms around her waist, and buried his head in her lap--as if he were a child needing comfort.

the action touched her; she began to pat his head, running her fingers through his hair and stroking his cheek. . . . "that's right!" she crooned. . . . "weep now, weep much and long because of your sin! . . . so i have done every night--not that it helps much. . . . out here nobody pays attention to our tears . .

"oh, beret, my own girl!"

per hansa gazed deep into her eyes; a sound of agony came from his throat; he sank down suddenly in a heap and knew nothing more. . . .

outside, the fiendish shapes flickered and danced in the dying glow of the day. the breeze had died down; the air seemed unaccountably lighter.

. . . that night the great prairie stretched herself voluptuously; giantlike and full of cunning, she laughed softly into the reddish moon. "now we will see what human might may avail against us! . . . now we'll see!" . . .

the minister came out into the yard, with his satchel in his hand, and glanced around at the neighbourhood where he had arrived. in his wake came kjersti, bashfully tripping out of the house; tönseten walked restlessly about the yard, handling one thing after another, but did not approach the minister; then the latter called out to him:

they gazed at the minister in alarm, but for a while said nothing.

"well--poor beret!" sighed kjersti, compassionately.

"beret? . . . so that is her name? what is the matter with the woman? are they so very poor?"

suddenly tönseten forgot his reserve and spoke up emphatically: "i'll tell you about it. this per hansa--that is to say, per holm--he has got rich out here; he has done better than anyone else, though he came here without a cent to his name. and why shouldn't he have done well? he has plenty of help in his own family, so he never needs to hire; and besides that, good luck has followed him right along. the first year we settled, for instance, the grasshoppers came and made a clean sweep of the rest of us; but per hansa saved his whole crop! the same year he made a big haul with his potatoes . . .

thought, the two gazing at him apprehensively; they dared not speak to him in this mood. at last he said, quietly, "i think we had better arrange it this way, mother: i will go over there first, and you follow about noontime. as for you, my friend," turning to tönseten, "try to do your errand well! remember that they must bring all the children requiring baptism. don't forget that! and tell them to be sure and bring their hymn books, too."

the minister was now making his preparations to go to per hansa's; as the distance was so short, he had decided to leave his horse.

tönseten fussed about uneasily, delaying his errand; he assured the minister that he needn't worry--he would get the message around to everybody in good season--it would only take a minute or two! . . . his red beard caught the sunlight every time he moved his head, which now kept bobbing around in a ridiculous way.

at last the minister took his departure and tönseten was on hand to go along with him.

the time for the meeting had come. the people filed slowly in and took their places, settling down wherever space was available; on the beds sat women crowded close together, strung along the edge like beads; these were mostly the mothers, and behind them sat and lay the children all over the beds; on the big chest eight in all had taken their seats, running from big to little; the chest had been pulled out from the wall, so that people could sit on all four sides; the six rough benches which per hansa and hans olsa had hastily nailed together were now filled to capacity, mostly by women, young children, and older people who were not able to stay on their feet so long.

the beds stood in one corner of the room, the stove in another; in the third were the minister and the table; in the fourth, and on every available part of the floor, people were packed like sardines. as many as the room would actually hold had crowded in, eager to see the minister. but not all who had come could gain an entra

but as the pastor asked the child's name and she gave it, and he repeated it clearly and distinctly, so as to be heard throughout the room--"peder victorious, dost thou renounce--" . . . something extraordinary happened. from out that pale face over in the corner came a sound of anguish. beret rose up and pushed her way violently through the crowd, which moved aside in sudden alarm to let her pass, then closed immediately in behind her; per hansa tried to follow, but found it hard to make a passage through the throng, which now was crowding forward in order to get a better view; and all at once her voice, shrill and vibrant, pierced the room: "this evil deed shall not be done!" . . . she was already halfway there. some blocked her passage; others tried to silence her. . . . "oh, let me go!" she cried. "this sin shall not happen! how can a man be victorious out here, where the evil one gets us all! . . . are you all stark mad?" her cries

e downward, crying and screaming; two half-grown boys, overcome by the horror of it, silently pressed their cheeks against the sod wall; the doorway was now crowded with curious faces, one tier above another. all wanted to see what was going on.

the minister paused in the service.

"take your wife outside, peder holm! the air in here is close and bad for a sick person. i will talk to her afterward. . . . and the rest of you--please keep quiet!"

it took some time to calm the morbid excitement. per hansa had finally reached beret; he lifted her in his arms, but the people crowded around so densely that it was difficult to get through, and all the while beret was striking out wildly, pulling and pushing in a frantic effort to escape. she foamed at the mouth. . . . "this is the work of the devil!" she muttered through clenched teeth. . . . "now he will surely take my little boy! . . . god save us--we perish!"

the meeting lasted inordinately long. when the pastor was finally through he announced

after the service the people remained standing around in groups out in the yard, talking about the minister and the sermon, and discussing in low tones the sad thing that had happened that day. the latter event claimed most of their attention. everyone felt great sympathy for this family on whom adversity had laid such a heavy hand; some thought it was very wrong for per hansa to keep a person like beret at home; a tragedy might happen at any time--and then it would be too late; various incidents of this kind were recalled; some remembered also that per hansa himself was a hard-hearted sinner who needed serious admonition; but they were all sorry for him, just the same.

none of the people of the house were to be seen. the crowd outside stood looking around, as if waiting for something to happen; no one wanted to leave until he knew. . . .

a few women were still ins

w sod stable, from which seemed to come the sound of voices and the whimpering cry of a child; he took up the boy in his arms, went over to the door, pushed it open, and stepped inside. the room had no windows; it was so dark in there that as he peered about, coming straight from the twilight, he could not make out the objects clearly. he was at once aware, however, of the presence of people; he walked farther in, looking around for what he knew was there.

they were sitting on a bundle of hay--per hansa and beret, she with her face pressed close against his, he with one arm about her neck and the other about her waist; and-ongen clung to her father's shoulder, her arms clasped tightly around his neck.

"the sweet peace of god be upon you!" said the pastor, gently, as soon as he had discovered them. "the people have all gone. and now, mother holm, i should like very much to have you cook us a good cup of coffee, if there is any in your house; i want to take supper with you."

ve him all you can; but do not forget to thank him who has given you this precious gift. there is the promise of a splendid man in that fine boy; you will surely have much joy in him!"

beret ceased caressing the boy and sat bent over him, listening to the words of the minister. then she rose hurriedly and smoothed down her dress; again the minister got the impression that in some curious way she felt ashamed. without saying a word, she took a child by either hand and walked out of the stable.

per hansa remained sitting on the pile of hay, resting his head on one hand; his hair and beard were unkempt, and quite grizzled now; his face was deeply furrowed, as if by the marks of a ruthless hand; his whole figure seemed fearfully ravaged and broken, like a forest maple shattered by a storm.

the minister sat down beside him; he began to confess per hansa with all the gentleness of a sympathetic and understanding pastor.

"now tell me everything. two can carry what one alone cannot lift. tell me ev

erything from the beginning."

without changing his position, per hansa looked down at the hay, sighed, and began to talk in broken accents: "i don't understand it myself, you see. . . . i only know that damnation has come down upon us. . . . it can't continue much longer--i'll probably have to send her away." again he sighed, and then became silent.

it seemed to the minister as if the sum total of human tragedy sat talking to him. . . . a chill had entered the dimly lighted room.

"perhaps you are right . . . otherwise, the cross might become too heavy for you to

a long pause fell.

"but she is not entirely deranged, is she?"

"partly or entirely--what difference does it make? if the fiddle is cracked, it's cracked. . . ."

"maybe so . . . yes, yes. . . ."

still looking down at the hay, per hansa continued:

"i don't know that i am guilty of any other wrong toward her than that our oldest boy came before we were married; but in that matter we were equally to blame. . . . and then i brought her out here. i suppose that there is where the real trouble lies. . . . i don't believe she grieves much about that other affair. . . . no, it's this business out here--and for the life of me i can't see any sin in it."

"i think i understand," said the minister, gently.

"but is a man to refuse to g

o where his whole future calls, only because his wife doesn't like it?" . . . the question sprang out of per hansa's soul, as if he were for the first time opening the door to many years of pent-up suffering. he turned his strong, resolute face toward the minister, begging for an answer.

"indeed he may, my good man," said the minister, earnestly. "but it would be better if they were both agreed upon it."

"agreed, yes--easy enough to say! . . . when the only disagreement, for instance, was that she advised waiting another year! . . . and it isn't so much what she has said since we came out here. . . . now,

 i wish you would tell me--" per hansa spoke softly, almost diffidently. "suppose a husband and wife cannot agree--what, then, is he to do?"

the minister felt through the question the aching need of the man for relief and comfort.

"therefore shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh," he quoted. "there you have the lord's decree. but if the law applies to man, it must apply to woman as well. between you two there has, as i understand it, been no real disagreement?"

per hansa shook his head; the words came with great difficulty:

"i sometimes wonder if there ever were two people who cared quite as much for each other as we do. . . . but that hasn't made things any easier; you can't lift the ocean, whether it rages in a storm or lies quiet in a flat calm. . . . and now, please tell me, you who are a minister and understand the scriptures, what is the man to do?" per hansa grasped the minister by the arm, clutching hard in his terrible agitation.

"he shall humble himself before the lord his god, and shall take up his cross to bear it with patience!" said the minister, impressively.

"ha-ha!" per hansa suddenly burst out in a bitter laugh. "that's too scanty a fare for me to live on. you'd better put that kind of talk aside. . . . i ask as an ignorant man, and i must have an answer that i can understand: did i do right or did i do wrong when i brought her out her

"no, i am not; and let me tell you something more." per hansa's voice hardened. "we find other things to do out here than to carry crosses!" then he fell silent. the minister tried to find words with which to reprove him; but in a moment per hansa began again--and now it was he who rebuked the minister: "my experience has been that it is mighty easy for one to talk about things he has not tried! . . . i have sweat blood over this thing--and now i'm no longer equal to it. . . . have you ever thought what it means for a man to be in constant fear that the m

other may do away with her own children--and that, besides, it may be his fault that she has fallen into that state of mind?"

when the minister finally answered, he had become all gentleness again. "no, thanks and praise to god, such affliction he has spared me!" he put one arm over per hansa's shoulder. "tell me how all this came about."

per hansa sat for a while without answering; he seemed like a man trying to climb a steep hill, whose strength has given out; all at once he got up and went over to the door, standing there and looking out a long time into the darkness of the night. the minister followed him. . . .

"there isn't much to say about such things," per hansa began. "she has never felt at home here in america. . . . there are some people, i know now, who never should emigrate, because, you see, they can't take pleasure in that

had the habit of fault-finding. . . . she struggled hard when the child was born, and we all thought she wouldn't survive--or him, either. that's why we had to baptize him at once. in my heedless joy, after the worst was over and things had turned out all right, i went and gave him that second name. . . . and then everything seemed to go to pieces!"

"that name . . . ?"

"yes, the second name. it was very wrong of me, i know. i see that now."

"what are you saying, man? such a beautiful name!"

per hansa looked at him. . . . "do you really mean it?"

"of course i mean it! it is the handsomest name i can ever remember giving to any child. peder victorious--why, it sings like a beautiful melody!"

"please tell me--is it really a human name? and wasn't it a sacrilege on my part?" asked per hansa, incredulously, hardly daring yet to acknowledge his joy.

"my dear man, have you worried about that, too?"

"have i? . . . don't mention it! . . . you mean that the name is all right?"

"yes, indeed," sai

per hansa gazed at the minister, bringing his face close up in order to see him better in the growing dusk of the evening. slowly his eyes began to light with a new courage; he took a deep breath, and straightened his body up for the first time in many a long day.

"i must ask you again, for i am an ignorant man: is this really true? . . . and won't you please tell her the same thing, too--as soon as you can?

"i certainly will. . . . so she does not like the name?"

"no; that's the trouble. . . . she be

"yes--may god help us!--she both saw her and talked with her! . . . one night i lay asleep, the first summer after the grasshoppers had come. i had saved my whole crop and got it in. suddenly i was awakened by some one talking aloud in the room. and there she was, pacing back and forth in the middle of the floor and talking to her mother, exactly as though she were sitting by her side. . . . i know that she saw her, i tell you; and the child--she was carrying the child in her arms!" . . . per hansa's breath failed him for a moment. . . . "'it's no use, mother,' she said. 'the boy can't come to you with a name that satan has tricked per into giving him!' those were the very words she used. i got up, lighted a candle, and as i watched her pacing there, with the little fellow in her arms, then, at last, i saw how it was with her . . . i saw it then. until that time i had refused to believe it. . . . pastor," whispered per hansa, "do you know what it means to feel the skin creep up your back?

"did she try to harm the child?"

"not then." he shook his head. "i can't say whether she had such thoughts or not; but she took the notion that her mother wanted the child with her. . . . the rest came later." per hansa pulled himself together with a strong effort. . . . "it will be two years this summer; it happened toward evening, one day when the grasshoppers came in such numbers that it was hard to see the sky. if sörrina, our neighbour woman, hadn't been making us a visit, it's hard telling . . . but there she sat, holding the child."

"the lord show mercy unto you!"

"well may you say it! . . . that afternoon, when the grasshoppers began to beat like hail against the walls, she remembered that some of t

"but what might have been in her mind i cannot say. i forgot to tell you," he went on, controlling himself once more, "that the very night before, her mother was in the room with her; beret talked with her just as plainly as i now stand here talking to you. she had got up and dressed herself, and was telling her mother all about everything, the way women do . . . and, would you believe it, she wanted to cook coffee for her! . . .

"and how was it afterward?" the minister asked, deeply moved.

"well, you see," said per hansa, wiping his eyes, "i had to do something about it. so i persuaded her to let sörrina take the child during the summer."

"you got her to agree to that?"

"yes, after a while; at first she wouldn't hear of it, but finally she gave in. and now i don't know whether i did right or wrong; i believe it hurt her terribly to have the little fellow gone. i saw how she wandered about the room, as if longing to care and do for him, but he was not there. . . . and one night after the plague came--i couldn

"what do you intend to do about it this summer?"

"this summer?" . . . per hansa's face was drawn with fear as he turned to the minister. . . . "if satan lets his hosts loose upon us again this summer, then i don't know what will happen!"

the minister patted him on the shoulder:

"take no thought for the morrow! the plague cannot last forever. and remember that the lord is always near. as the number of thy days, so shall thy strength be. and now take this advice from me: from now on keep close to her; be toward her as you were during those happy days when you first got her

the minister gazed before him in deep thought, his heart wrung with pity and compassion. "perhaps the lord will allow me to reach her mind with a clarifying idea. his word is living life and can move mountains. . . . when i return you must take her to communion."

his hand was patting the shoulder on which it rested. per hansa wept, his sobs coming in short gasps that shook his frame; he experienced a blessing descending upon him, and his burden grew lighter. there was much more he wanted to say, but just now he could not speak. . . .

a long pause followed; then the minister spoke again: "let us not stand here longer in fear and darkness, talking about sad things; our bodies need nourishment."

they walked across the yard in the quiet prairie evening, per hansa so happy that he could gladly have offered the minister

just as they reached the door of the hut somebody rounded the corner on the run and called in a quick, scared voice, "father!"

both men jumped, so suddenly had the figure come out of the darkness.

"is that you, ola? what are you up to, anyway?"

"father, come here!" the boy grasped per hansa by the arm and tried to pull him along. "hans is sitting up on the indian mound, crying and taking on! i can't get him to come home!"

"is he sick?"

"no!"

"what's the matter with him, then?" the father shook the boy.

"he is afraid of mother . . . you must come right away!"

the boy sped away into the darkness.

per hansa gave the minister a look which seemed to say: "now you see how things are here!" . . . and all the radiance that for a moment had lighted up his soul was suddenly gone out.

"where is he?"

"over there!"

"you run home. i guess i can find him. is it over there by the grave?"

"yes . . . here . . ."

ole vanished on the other side of the mound.

"store-hans, where are you keeping yourself?"

a smothered cry came through the darkness.

per hansa followed the sound and almost stumbled over a writhing form which lay on the ground; he bent over and lifted it up in his arms.

"hansy-boy, what's the matter?"

the father sat down with the limp, slender body of the boy in his arms, rocking and lulling it.

"is . . . is . . . mother queer again?"

"no, indeed! mother is all right, and now supper is ready."

"did . . . did she . . . kill permand?"

the minister took the bowl without looking at her, he emptied it at one draught, put it down, and thanked her in a few brief words.

almost immediately beret grew bashful and uneasy over what she had done; in her nervousness she picked up a shirt that she was making for one of the boys, sat down by the candlelight near the stove, and began to sew as hard as she could; but she kept her face turned away from the minister.

per hansa and the boys came in; sörine announced that supper was ready; the four men sat down and began the meal. the minister looked at the younger boy; his face was swollen, his eyes were red with weeping; a heavy veil seemed to hide his handsome features. at the sight of the boy the minister felt more like crying than eating; a sudden revulsion overcame him. laying down his knife and fork, he asked for another bowl of milk, which he emptied slowly, and then waited for the others to get through. when

he thought they had finished, he folded his hands on the table and began to pray to the unseen one whose presence was always near.

so quickly did he begin, that at first per hansa didn't realize what was going on and was on the point of asking the minister what he said. the same thing happened to the others: ole had just discovered that he wasn't quite satisfied, and was reaching for another piece of bread; sörine was about to offer them all more coffee. but beret sat bowed over her sewing, trying to catch every word; she took a few stitches, and then the work dropped to her lap; something compelled her to turn and look at him. the light of the candle cast a reddish gle

"i suppose i shall have to do it myself," thought beret--yet she, too, could not get up from her chair. . . . the child had entered a glory where no one dared to follow. . . . without interrupting his flow of words, the minister lifted the boy onto his knees, folded the baby hands within his own, and went on with the prayer. . . .

y way; and in a little while they both seemed to be having great fun. but he didn't have anything to say to the others; and they, in turn, couldn't find anything to say to him.

but the next morning, as they sat at the breakfast table, the minister was both merry and talkative, and helped himself so liberally to the food that it was a pleasure just to see him do it. he asked many questions regarding the life and conditions in that vicinity, and showed himself so well informed about farming that per hansa asked, without thinking, whether he had ever been a farmer. . . . then he suddenly remembered what the minister had told him to do the evening before; he got up hastily, called to the boys, and they left the house together.

the moment they were gone beret grew very uneasy; she found her sewing again, and sat down with it in a furtive, embarrassed way. the minister could see nothing unusual about her, except that her face was so singularly childlike; this impression came mostly from the way she

she gave him a quick look; her cheeks were flushed.

the voice had grown querulous again and bore the same childlike expression; the minister made no reply. he took her hand, thanked her briefly for her hospitality, and hurried out of the room. when he got outside his forehead was damp with perspiration. he saw per hansa coming in his direction, but turned away to avoid him. . . .

when beret sat down awhile later to dress the little boy she felt that she could sing aloud to-day--felt that she had to sing, that she could not help it. both words and melody seemed to rise in her throat; it was the baptismal hymn that they had used the previous day, and she sang all the verses. . . . while she sang she handled the boy so gently . . . as if she were almost afraid to touch him. . . .

west; there was just heat enough to be comfortable; the air swept one's face like a soft, silken veil. the young people felt like taking off their clothes; the sun quivered down through a greenish-blue haze far off in the deep sky; and over on the prairie the first meadow lark had sung that morning. both the lark and the robin had found their way out there the second summer after the settlers came.

several folks had arrived ahead of the appointed time, and were standing in little groups around per hansa's house; most of them had walked over, but those who lived farther away had come jolting along in a lumber wagon, the load and the jolting apparently increasing together. the people were all laughing and talking together, full of life and fun; from their actions no one would have gathered that they were on their way to church.

folks passing them stopped and laughed, and offered to push awhile. "oh no, thank you!" said aslak, merrily. "now i can manage her alone, but it hasn't always been thus--no, indeed!" then he laughed again as he pushed on, and looked lovingly at her. she nodded and smiled, laughing back at him. . . . "you take my place and let me push awhile!" . . . that gave them a good laugh together.

the minister had reached the settlement the evening before and had stayed overnight at per hansa's. that morning they had been up early, had hurried through the breakfast, and immediately after had started to put the house in order for the service. it had been thoroughly cleaned and tidied up before he came. all kinds of wild flowers that were to be found on the prairie had been gathered and hung in bouquets of various sizes under the ceiling, or put into glasses and bowls that stood around in every conceivable place. there was something strange and haphazard about it, as if it had been do

with a supreme effort he got up from the bed and went out into the yard.

when he reached the other house it was packed full of people; the elders had found places in the front of the room; there also sat aslak tjöme with his wife, the invalid woman comfortably propped up at his side; per hansa and his wife sat on the very first bench, right in front of the improvised altar. the minister scanned the crowd, paused for a moment, then came forward and spoke calmly to per hansa: "now, when the service begins, you two will please come forward first. as soon as you have received communion, you had better go outside, for it will be hot and stuffy in here." then he went from person to person, writing down the names of the communicants; at once a deep silence fell on the room.

the minister ended his sermon, looked at his watch, and his brows knit in a puzzled frown. how had this happened? according to the watch, he had been speaking for an hour and fifteen minutes. could it be possible?

the people came forward, knelt down before per hansa's big chest, and received an assurance so gracious and benign that they could hardly credit its reality. . . . many eyes filled with tears during that hour. . . .

the absolution took a long time. the minister looked again at his watch; he still couldn't understand where the time had gone. in his heart he blamed himself bitterly; not only had he spoiled the communion sermon, but he had also made it so long that no time was left for the regular sermon of the day!

and so he omitted the sermon al

he had been present at the service last sunday, had taken part in the communion; and the longer the service had lasted the stronger and deeper had grown his felicity. he was only a common, uneducated man, and probably lacked a proper conception of the wonders the minister preached about; yet this he knew for certain, that nothing so glorious as that communion service in per hansa's sod house had he ever before experienced, and the happiness of that hour was still glowing with steady warmth in hans olsa's heart. . . . as per hansa and beret had knelt before the chest, he had looked at them, thinking of many things. beret's sad condition could easily be seen in her face. ah no, when reason once leaves a person, it seldom returns! . . . and per hansa himself had become an old man long before his time: his hair and beard were grey; his face was thin and worn; not till then

 was going through. he had gazed at the kneeling couple until his large, heavy features drooped with sympathy. could he at that moment have shared his own happiness with his friend, he would have handed it over to him without a question.

coming home from the service that day, he had wandered about the place, pondering over an idea which he wasn't ready to mention to his wife until he had given it more thought. but on monday night he broached the subject to sörine: shouldn't they offer to take per hansa's youngest child? . . . did she suppose that would be too much for her? . . . you see, he wasn't any too sure about it, himself. . . . and now he told her all his thoughts of the previous sunday. . . . what did she say--should they offer to take the child? . . .

sörine laughed and asked him teasingly if he didn't think he'd soon have enough with his own? the next instant, however, she too became serious; and now she confided in him that for a long time she had been thinking about this very sa

me thing, herself. but she hadn't mentioned it to per hansa because he knew that she was only too willing; had he wanted to bring it about, he would only have had to ask her. . . .

they couldn't be sure of that, her husband objected; per hansa knew that she was soon going to have one of her own, and he was not the kind of a man to impose on others. . . . he doubted very much, as a matter of fact, if per hansa fully realized the seriousness of beret's condition. should the plague return this summer and that awful spell come over her again, there was no telling what might happen. . . . "isn't it really up to us, who can see the true state of affairs?"

sörine gave an unexpected answer to this question: "i believe that beret is jealous of me because i'm so fond of her little boy. . . . i think i've noticed it."

hans olsa pondered this information awhile. . . . perhaps his wife was right; and there we

re other difficulties, too. . . . suppose they did take the boy. could they be certain that he would thrive better here? and if he didn't, where would be the gain? . . . and would it be fair to the parents even to suggest such a thing? . . . at any rate, if things came to such a pass that per hansa had to send beret away--which wasn't at all improbable--then some one would have to take the child permanently. . . . and just now, wouldn't it be too great a burden for sörine? . . . no, hans olsa couldn't quite see his way clear. . . .

sörine only laughed at him. . . . certainly she would undertake to be a mother to that blessed dear little boy--it would be only one more--that is, if it ever seemed necessary. but she doubted very much if per hansa would consent to the plan; he thought more

 discussed the matter at great length that evening.

wednesday afternoon of the same week a faint mist floated before the sun. a light, warm rain fell at intervals from drifting shreds of clouds. between showers the sun peeped through the clouds to see what was going on down on the prairie; and he set the rainbow here and there as a sign that he was well pleased. there was a big blue heaven behind it all, the air very still . . . beautiful weather.

beret sat in the old sod barn which per hansa long since had made over into a workshop and storehouse, sewing a shirt for little permand. the door was open and she sat where she could look out. she had sent and-ongen to the field with some water for the boys, who were hoeing the potatoes. per hansa was repairing the roof of the new barn. it had been leaking there since the frost went out of the ground last spring, because the willow poles used for supports had not been heavy enough. she could not see him from where she sat, but she could h

. . . a blessed man he was, indeed. . . . and the way he had got them to sing! she had to smile as she remembered it. . . . just imagine! he had made them sing exactly the same hymns here in this sod house as the people sang in the churches in norway--yet no harm had befallen the house on that account. . . . melodies were yet hanging throughout the room; yesterday while at work she had heard them everywhere. she had even caught one up and followed it--had sung until per hansa came rushing in, to ask her what was the matter, he had looked at her so queerly . . . he ought not to get frightened just because she sang!

as she recalled the incident now, snatches of the song came back to her again, and she began humming. . . . no, no--this would never do! she might scare some one again--people seemed so easily frightened here. . . . this had turned out to be a rather hard piece of sewing, but the child was going to look fine in his new shirt . . . would she be able to hea

r hands resting on it without motion. . . . mother will sit by the stove, just as she always has done when she has been here. "well," she'll ask, "are you sure now, beret, that he is going to be a minister? don't draw hasty conclusions--you've always been so impulsive!" that's exactly what she'll say. . . . then i must answer: "yes, mother, you needn't doubt it any longer; for i myself sat here and heard how this wonderful man argued about it with the lord--and how he got his way, too. and both per hansa and sörine heard it also. you can ask them if you don't believe me." . . . then mother will look at me in her kind way, for a long, long time. at last she'll say: "well, if god can use him, it certainly isn't proper for me to want him; though i would like to have some one of yours with me. but now you must take good care of him, my child!" . . . "yes, mother, how can i help it? how can i ever forget that he is to go out into the world to give of the glory of the lord to the children of men?" .

 . . then mother will get up to go. . . . i must say to her: "don't forget to greet father! you might just as well tell him all this, about his big chest." . . .

beret's face had gradually grown very serious. but the sound of heavy steps in the yard brought her out of her reveries. some one stopped at the barn, and then went in; in a moment she heard the voice of per hansa. . . . what can they want of him now? . . . hm, hm--it's per hansa this, and per hansa that! first one comes and takes him away, and then another; they never leave him a minute in peace! can't they understand that i need him at home? . . . and he is so easily talked around--he can't say no to anyone. . . . i suppose it's some more hauling--and then he'll be gone for a long time. . . . she picked up her work again, but the sewing failed to claim her attention. . . . it took a long while over that errand. who could it be?

putting the work away, beret stepped quickly out of the doo

. . . "should beret get another spell, you know what might happen--a calamity none of us could get over. we've all seen enough of such things. . . . now, we will take the boy and care for him as though he were our own flesh and blood. . . . sörrina and i have talked it over."

beret's childlike features suddenly took on a peculiarly covert expression. . . . ah-ha! so that's his errand? . . . hush! hush! there is per hansa speaking! . . . his voice sounds so queer--can he have been frightened again? . . .

. . . "that's more than good of you and sörrina--i realize it all; but matters will have to take their own course. . . . she is the mother, and i can see how she clings to him. . . . this spring i worried a lot about what i ought to do when summer came; but now i've decided that she shall keep the child with her. if she doesn't get well by having him at home, it certainly won't make things any easier for her t

her now, no matter what happens. . . . there's a destiny that rules us all--it's bound to overtake us, whether we are here or there."

. . . "now i'm afraid you are taking too great a responsibility upon yourself," said the other voice, slowly. "remember what might have happened last summer when she had the spell."

a short silence fell in the barn. beret's features grew tense. bending over with a quick, fierce movement, she snatched up a piece of stake and grasped it tightly.

. . . "no," came per hansa's voice in meditative tones, "that's just what none of us can say for certain. she might have escaped the attack altogether if the child had been at home. . . . i remember how pitiably she seemed to miss him. i'm not at all sure that isn't what brought on the spell. perhaps that burden, added to everything else, became too much for her. . . . and even if the spell had come on with him here at home, she might not have harmed him--i doubt it very much. . . ."

"o god! how beautiful these bells ring!" thought beret.

. . . "because," per hansa went on, sadly, "i should not have coaxed and persuaded her to come with me out here. . . . perhaps it was her misfortune that we two ever met. . . . you remember how it was in nordland: we had boats that we sailed to lofoten in, big crafts that could stand all kinds of rough weather, if properly handled; and then there were the small boats that we used for the home fishing; the last were just as fine and just as good for their own purposes as the other kind for theirs, but you couldn't exchang

 you couldn't sail to lofoten with the small boats, nor fish at home in the larger ones. . . . for you and me, life out here is nothing; but there may be others so constructed that they don't fit into this life at all; and yet they are finer and better souls than either one of us. . . . there are so many things we don't comprehend."

. . . "i certainly ought to know beret," remarked the other voice, thoughtfully. "we were playmates, she and i." . . .

. . . "i doubt that very much," interrupted per hansa, "though you are an observing man. i have lived with her all these years, yet i must confess that i don't know her. . . . she is a better soul than any i've ever met. it's only lately that i have begun to realize all she has suffered since we came out here. the minister was probably right; no one can ever fathom the depths of a mother's heart. . . . the urge within me drove me on and on, and never would i stop; for i reasoned like this, that where i found happiness others must find it as well.

. . . but you see how things have turned out! . . . the finest castle on earth i was going to build her--and here we're still living in a mole's hole--all my dreams have been crushed in misery. . . . but this i've decided, that she shall keep the baby--though i thank you for the offer." . . . the sadness in per hansa's voice had grown deeper and more profound than the grey autumn evening that falls on the bleak prairie.

. . . "you mustn't feel hurt about the offer," put in the slow voice of hans olsa. "we only thought it might do a little good."

beret listened no more; she walked away like one in a dream of happiness; she did not know where she was going nor what she did. in the southern sky floated transparent little clouds; rainbow ribbons hung down from them. she saw the rainbow's glow; her face was tr

ept in this house? . . .

beret went searching about in her own home like a housewife who had been away on a long visit and returns a partial stranger. but the feeling of home-coming filled her with such joy, that she could only laugh at her bewilderment. . . . she found one thing here, another there; at last the boy had eaten his fill and was satisfied.

all at once another thought struck her; she glanced around with puzzled anxiety. . . . where were the rest of the family to-day? . . . surely per hansa was somewhere around. hadn't she just been talking to him? . . . and where could the children be keeping themselves? . . . it exasperated her, yet she couldn't help laughing: here they had all been with her only a moment ago, and now she couldn't recall the least little thing! was she walking in her sleep, in broad daylight? . . . thinking vaguely that she must try to get things cleared up, she went out of the door and looked around.

the mildness of the afternoon greeted her like a friend. she

 wasn't that hans olsa? didn't she know her own neighbour? . . . hearing some one still in the barn, she hurried across the yard and peered in.

"are you in there?" she called.

a stocky, broad-shouldered man appeared in the barn door; his face was deeply furrowed; his hair and beard, heavily sprinkled with grey, were now full of dust and straw. as she looked at him she felt strangely uneasy and disturbed; but she couldn't help giving him a bright smile:

"what in the world has happened to you, per hansa?"

he stood staring fixedly at her, unable to stir a muscle. no power on earth could have taken his eyes away from her face at that moment; he caught hold of the jamb of the door to steady himself. . . . god in heaven!--what had happened? . . .

beret saw his great agitation. now her disturbance increased--her concern over him grew genuine. "are you sick, per hansa?" she asked in tones of deepest sympathy, coming closer to him. "you mustn't keep on with this work when you aren't feeling well; t

here can't be such a hurry about it, you know."

per hansa cleared his throat to speak, but no words came . . . he could only look at her.

she noticed his pale, haggard face, and her anxiety grew insistent. "you've got to quit right now! . . . i'll run in and boil some milk for you!" . . . she hurried off to the house, too full of her new-found solicitude to wait for an answer.

in the open door per hansa stood gazing at her as she went; he longed to follow her, to touch her, to talk to her, but he dared not do it. . . . there was a spade standing beside the door; he picked it up and set it down inside. . . .

"no, it better not stand in here." he picked it up again and put it back. . . . his eyes rested on a hammer lying on the floor--the one he had been using a moment ago. "i must remember to put that hammer away before it gets tramped into the ground." . . . next moment he forgot all about it

"good gracious! what a sight i am to-day! no wonder he looked worried--he who always wants me so nice!" . . . while she was waiting for the milk to simmer, she washed her face and combed her hair; that done, she opened the big chest, found her best sunday garments, and hurriedly put them on. . . . now then, she wasn't quite so much of a scarecrow. . . .

the milk boiled; she lifted it off the stove, went to the door, and called per hansa. . . . as a timid child enters a stranger's house and does not dare to put aside his cap, so now per hansa stepped across his own threshold. permand was still sitting by the table; his father caught sight of him there, and walking over to him, picked the boy up and sat down in his stead; then he put him on his lap and gently stroked his hair. . . . his voice was gone--it would not come. . . . all the while he was casting furtive glances at his wife; big beads of sweat stood on his forehead.

cup after cup of the strong hot mixture; he couldn't keep his eyes off her face. . . . but still he found no words to say to her; whenever he tried to speak his throat closed. . . .

while he was drinking she came and sat down by his side, telling him innocently how topsy-turvy things had seemed to her to-day. why, she had just lain down for a moment with the child, and when she woke up it had seemed as though she had been gone for years and a day! she laughed merrily as she told him about it.

per hansa listened in silence, looked at her, and drank of the hot mixture until the tears rolled down his cheeks. . . . she chatted on unconsciously, her voice low but full and very sweet; as he gazed at her, he saw in her face only intelligent concern--only loving solicitude--exactly like the dear beret-girl that he used to know! . . . when he found it impossible to swallow another drop of the hot pepper-and-milk, she insisted that he lie down at once; if he would only take a good sweat, this cold woul

he lay thus until the paroxysm had passed and he felt that he could master himself. then he flung the covers aside, sat up suddenly on the edge of the bed, and l

"well, well," he assented, as if tired of arguing. "that may be right--it may be." . . . pulling himself together, he went out of the shed and started off before the wind. . . .

he could not get his clothes off unaided. . . . sörine had been up all night, well-nigh crazed with fear; twice she had started to go to per hansa's for help, but the storm had driven her back each time; then she had lighted a candle and placed it in the window, in hopes of its doing some good. she had fed the fire with desperate resolution, trying to face the fact that now the worst had happened and there was nothing to do about it, for fate is inexorable.

as soon as she had got him into the house she began tending him with frantic haste. she made him drink several bowls of hot milk with black pepper in it; then she put him to bed, warm

ft to do all the outside work alone. as soon as they had gone out, he tried to get out of bed and put on his clothes; but the chills grew so violent that he could not stand on his feet. he fell back on the bed. . . .

for two full days the blizzard raged. during the forenoon of the third day the snow ceased falling and the storm abated; but the air was still grey and bitterly cold. as soon as hans olsa saw that the storm was really letting up, he told sofie to put on her skis and go over to get per hansa. "this will never do," he said to his wife. "for three day and nights you haven't been out of your clothes. i may be a long time in getting over the cough." . . . he wanted to say more, but the words were lost in a paroxysm of coughing.

per hansa and the oldest two boys were making hay twists out in the barn when sofie brought the first news that her father had been out in the storm the other night and was now very sick. per hansa immediately dropped his work and went back with her. sörine lo

oked worn out and very much worried. she turned her head aside when she spoke to him, saying that things didn't look very well. then she went to the stove, put her apron up to her eyes, and murmured again--things didn't look very well! but per hansa's coming cheered her up a little and even seemed to take away some of her anxiety. in a moment her old buoyancy had come back; she dried her eyes and asked him to follow her into the bedroom.

in a hut on the border of the irish settlement lived an old woman who was so queer at times that she was called "crazy bridget." in fact, she had brought this name with her to the settlement; tönseten long ago had picked it up from her countrymen, and had translated it into norwegian--he made it kræsi-b

 her own accord; but many--especially those of her own race--came often to her for help in time of sickness. she had a great store of old-fashioned remedies, both for humans and for beasts, and she gave of them freely, without pay. most of the norwegians had consulted her at one time or another, in spite of the fact that they went on saying she was only a fraud. and though they said it, they all had to admit, when it came down to known cases, that she had a remarkable way with sick folks.

when per hansa saw how seriously ill his neighbour was he went out into the kitchen and said to sörine that some one must go and fetch bridget. they ought not to scorn her powers at a time like this--she might be able to help; at least, they must try every chance that offered.

suiting the action to the word, he went for her himself. a little later the old woman came trudging over on snow shoes, carrying an odd-looking bag on her back. she warmed herself at the fire, went into the bedroom, and looked at the

both sörine and hans olsa had faith in the woman and were glad that she had come. . . . one must try such remedies as one had. . . .

per hansa was very busy that forenoon; there was much to do at his own place, and more at his neighbour's. he had hurried home from hans olsa's after going for bridget; had called the two boys, and taken them with him at once to look after the cattle up north. before he left he told beret briefly how things were at their neighbour's, and asked her to arrange her own work so that she could go over toward evening and stay there for the night. it might be late before he could get back. . . .

 tönseten called at per hansa's as he was going by. he was on his way home from the east part of the settlement, and just wanted to drop in to see how they were after the storm. when he heard the news about hans olsa--how he had come down with such a bad cough, that it was doubtful if he would pull through--he decided to go over at once and tell sörine what to do. if anyone in these parts knew all there was to know about a cough, he was the man! tönseten was in an extraordinarily bright humour that evening. he told per ha

"this is certainly the work of the devil!" thought beret. "just now . . . !" but she went out of the house full of the same great exaltation, like one whose sins had been laid bare before the whole congregation. . . .

a little while later per hansa dropped in to see how they were getting along. he said that he would arrange with the solum boys to help him carry hay and water to the herd up north; that done, he would go to gjermund dahl's, to get him to come and help sörine with the chores. this evening he would come back to make a report about everything. now he must be gone. . . .

people were hard at work throughout the whole settlement; the weather continued threatening, and there was much to be done after the storm; hogs and cattle,

ven have that much. but the people there would borrow a sack of wheat from anybody who had one; and if they had no coffee mill in the house, they would use a mortar, or improvise one from a kettle. folks were cheerful about helping one another in those days. what one didn't have, he borrowed; if one got a new idea, he passed it on to his neighbours. the scarcity of fuel caused the most suffering, for hay burned like hay, even if twisted.

tönseten was sitting in the bedroom at hans olsa's when per hansa came back after supper. he was downhearted and quiet to-day. kjersti had been in bed most of the time because of the stiffness and soreness from her fall; and she was so cross, he explained, that if a fellow as much as looked at her she would bite his head off. he had had the devil to pay, with taking care of both her and himself and doing the chores besides. . . . as he noticed how flushed hans olsa's face was and heard how he struggled for breath, he wondered if his own cough had ever been as

a all that day; the coughing spells had come oftener; he had been restless and fretful; had asked first for one thing, and then for another, and was always inquiring about the weather. at that moment he happened to be quiet; when all at once he began to talk about the inevitable. . . . he asked both of his neighbours to help sörine when he was gone, and to give her their best advice about running the farm, just as he would have done for them, if either one of them had been in his place. . . . "per hansa, stay with me to-night! sörrina must have some sleep; she has had all the work to do outdoors, and needs some rest. it may take a long time with me yet--perhaps we shall need help from all of you!"

thus it came about that per hansa watched with him that night. sörine lay down in the other room, fully dressed. the door between the rooms stood open. she intended to doze only a minute and not lose herself so completely that she couldn't jump up to help when the worst spells came on; but she had
 
 ___________________________
 
 tramped about working in the snow nearly all day, and was so worn out that she soon dropped off into a sound sleep.

after all had been quiet in the house for some time, hans olsa looked up and asked, in a needlessly loud voice, if his wife was asleep. when no answer came from the other room, he lay still for quite a while, gazing up with his eyes fixed on space; then he began, in a calm, matter-of-fact way, to tell per hansa how he thought everything ought to be arranged after he was gone. he mentioned first a couple of little debts which he had in sioux falls; then he spoke of several of the new settlers who owed him for seed and cattle, and stipulated how much each was to pay. it transpired later that in every case he had stated less than what was owing to him. . . . sörine ought to hold the farm and keep on living here; for this was the country of the future--of that he was certain. per hansa would hereafter ha

he talked with great difficulty. every now and then he had to stop for breath. per hansa only nodded his replies; all he could think of to say was: "don't worry. . . . is there anything else now? . . . i will take care of everything."

little by little per hansa got the feeling that his friend had something on his mind; he could not tell exactly why he felt that way, but the impression grew stronger and stronger. every time a pause came over the sick man's talk, he expected to hear what it was. but there seemed to be nothing more. at last hans olsa fell silent; he was still looking

adful wheezing, grating sound, as from an old pair of leaky bellows when they are blown up hard.

when the cough had eased itself, hans olsa began once more his frightened groping among the things of the future; but now he spoke less coherently. after midnight he had a quiet spell when he lay as if exhausted and said nothing; but off and on he would glance at his neighbour out of the corners of his eyes; there was something unusual and urgent in the look--something that made a man afraid. . . . per hansa wondered if the end were at hand. . . .

but suddenly the sick man began to talk again. it was hardly what per hansa had expected to hear. he merely raised his eyes and asked in a low voice:

"is the snow very deep?"

"between our farms," said per hansa, "it doesn't lie less than four feet anywhere; and it's as deep as that on the level all over the prairie. down near the creek, by tönseten's, it must be as much as twenty feet deep! . . . it snowed just a little, i want you to know!"

"is it a

s bad as that?" . . . the sick man sighed heavily, his hands fidgeting with the covers; then he repeated in a low voice: "so--is it as deep as that?"

"was there something on your mind?"

"then it isn't possible to get anywhere!" . . . the powerful jaws closed; drops of sweat stood out on the great, shiny face.

per hansa's heart stirred with a nameless dread; he felt himself grow dizzy, but he cleared his throat and said, firmly:

"what is it that you want, hans olsa? . . . do you want the doctor?"

the sick man turned toward him.

"oh--it's the minister i need!" . . . then, after a moment, he added: "but don't you think the weather will be better in a day or two?" . . .

he lay perfectly still. when he got no answer he looked up and repeated, imploringly:

"don't you think so?"

per hansa rose to his feet and

began pacing back and forth across the floor. it must be very close in here . . . he felt so faint. thinking of how it was outdoors, he suddenly found himself bathed in perspiration. . . . god pity him who had to travel the prairie these days!

he came back to the bed.

"you feel that you must have him?"

"it is terrible to fall into the hands of the living god!" . . . the large, kindly features were drawn and trembling, with fear of the unknown. per hansa could scarcely endure it to look at him; he had to lean against the back of a chair for support. . . . in broken words, his friend repeated: "it is terrible . . . terrible . . . to fall . . . into his hands!" . . .

"hush, now! hush, now, man! don't talk blasphemy!" cried per hansa. "lie down, now. . . . see here . . . the covers are falling off you!"

the bulky form had reared itself violently up in bed. through a paroxysm of coughing hans olsa whimpered:

"tell sörrina to come here!"

ked for a moment as if he were passing away in the midst of the attack. hans olsa himself thought so. in wild alarm, per hansa resorted to pounding the sick man's back, just as one does with children when they have swallowed the wrong way. but after a while the spell gradually left him, as the others had done. he settled back, and a little later fell into a deep sleep, which lasted till morning.

the first rays of daylight woke sörine. her husband was already awake by that time, and seemed better. per hansa put on his coat and prepared to go; he had all his own work to do at home, besides hans olsa's cattle up north t

o look after.

hans olsa watched him get ready, following all his movements with a pathetic sadness like that which stands in a dog's eyes when he watches his master go away without him. then he called him over to the bedside and asked him again what the weather was like. there was an odd little quiver in his voice as he said, almost as though he were ashamed:

"i suppose it's still impossible to get anywhere?"

per hansa felt like laughing at such childishness in a grown-up man; he scarcely knew what to answer. but answer he must; so he braced himself, buttoned his big coat, put on his mittens, and said, firmly: "you ought to lie still and sleep awhile longer, hans olsa. . . . during the night you slept like a rock--and see how much better you are already! . . . i promise you that i'll be back some time later in the day."

"you don't think it can be done?"

nameless dread again seized per hansa. he stepped back

 and said, hastily: "calm yourself now, hans olsa! . . . we'll have to see about it--you understand."

the sick man reached out toward him, caught his hand and held it tightly, with something of his old strength. . . . "oh, per hansa!" he cried. . . . "there never was a man like you . . . !" and fell back on the pillow, exhausted.

all through the latter part of last summer and early fall per hansa had done a full man's work plus a bit more; nor had he spared the boys, either. and he had hired a number of men besides. he needed all the help he could get; for there was the new house to be built, the crops to be harvested, the fall plowing that must be done, and in addition, all the other work about the farm.

but he had gone about his duties in a mood that made any task easy both for himself and for those who worked with him. his wife's improved condition had relieved him of whole loads of

s she began to offer there would creep in more and more of concern for him; and little by little it got to be almost exclusively for him. as he sat there listening it sounded to him as if he were the most hardened sinner in all christendom; he would feel ashamed before the children, would find some pretext to steal out of the house. but he couldn't bring it across his heart to speak to her; for how can one reason with a child that is so delicate as she, he thought.

 

in the grey light of dawn per hansa returned from the bedside of hans olsa, looking like a man who had reached the end of his rope. he hung up his coat and hat and sat down at the table in the large kitchen to eat his breakfast. off and on he glanced out of the window. while beret brought him his food, she asked how things were over at hans olsa's. at first she got very little satisfaction; his answers were short and taciturn, and he seemed engrossed in his own thoughts. he ate slowly and took a long time over the meal; all the w

. he just lies there and whimpers about having the minister. . . . there's something uncanny about him. i can't understand it at all." . . . these remarks were not directed at beret; he stood looking straight ahead of him, as if thinking aloud. beret had stopped working when she heard him; her face lighted up as she answered, with an unmistakable ring of exultation in her voice: "but i can understand it! . . . now may god be near and hear his prayer! some one must go for the minister at once."

per hansa did not move; he was staring off into space. beret crossed the floor, her hands full of dishes, and stopped directly in front of him. . . . "you must persuade some one to go with you. this is terrible weather! . . . could you try going on horseback?"

"huh--horseback! how you talk!"

"but it is an awful thing for a soul to be cast into hell when human beings can prevent it!"

per hansa seemed amused at this idea. "well, if hans olsa is bound in that direction, there'll be a good many more from

d not repress a shudder of horror. greatly wrought up, she set the dishes down on the table and said, fiercely: "you know what our life has been: land and houses, and then more land, and cattle! that has been his whole concern--that's been his very life. now he is beginning to think about not having laid up treasures in heaven. . . . can't you understand that a human being ever becomes concerned over his sins and wants to be freed from them?"

"i suppose i don't understand anything, do i?" said per hansa in a tone of disgust. "perhaps i don't understand, for instance--though god knows it would not be difficult for any grown person to see it--that no man could cross the prairie from here to the james river, as things are now, and come out alive--. . . as for hans olsa, the lord will find him good enough, even without either minister or klokker--that i truly believe!"

"the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not! . . . here lies one who is about to receive his sight, a

nd we will not reach out a hand to help him!"

"hold your tongue, beret!" cried per hansa, sharply, anger at the hopelessness of the argument getting the better of him. "do you want to drive me out into the jaws of death?"

"what horrible things you say, per hansa!"

"horrible--well! don't you suppose the good lord would have provided other weather if he had intended me to make this trip?"

she gave him a quick look.

"it's possible to try, isn't it?" she said with cold persistence. "why can't you get some one to go with you? you could take indi--he is light-footed, and we could wrap things around all four legs, so that he wouldn't sink through the snow. they say that has been done before--i've read about it. . . . henry has a sleigh; and you could turn

back at any time, if you couldn't make it. . . . the lord would forgive us then for what we couldn't possibly do--if we had tried!"

"he had better do that right now!" growled per hansa, a gust of hot anger nearly choking him. without another word he went to the stairs, called ole and store-hans, and told them to get into their clothes right away. pulling on his coat, he slammed out of the house to do the morning chores.

beret looked at the door through which he had just disappeared. . . . there he leaves in a fit of temper, fuming and cussing! . . . she took up the morning work, her thoughts busy with many things. before she realized it she was absorbed in what had so often

been on her mind lately: what had happened to him, anyway? what had made him so different? . . . his warm playfulness, his affectionate tenderness--what had become of it? . . . oh no, no! she caught herself, how can i be thinking of such things again! the sweet desires of the flesh are the nets of satan. . . . how deeply sin has besoiled all life! . . . beret went about her work with a greater determination; but her sad mood did not lift.

a hundred things were waiting for per hansa outside, but he was so angry that he scarcely noticed what he was about. . . . the world seemed upside down to-day. . . . that grown people couldn't see an inch beyond their noses! here lay hans olsa, driving himself out of his mind because he couldn't have a minister--when there was no better man than himself in all christendom! . . . and here was beret insisting that he leap right into the arms of death--she who had a heart so tender that she couldn't harm a mouse! . . . people could certainl

e live in!" . . . if this went on much longer, he would go out of his mind himself--if he wasn't a little crazy already! . . . he dashed from one thing to another in a frenzy, leaving everything half done.

when the boys came out they all put on their skis and started across the snowdrifts to hans olsa's north quarter. the day was bleak; a cold air was drawing in from the west. to store-hans, all these fields of snow were glorious; now he could skim like a bird over the drifts. little by little per hansa forgot his temper as he caught the infection of the boy's exuberant joy.

while they were working over the cattle, per hansa talked in a steady stream to the boys. all this snow, he said, promised a bumper crop next summer--you could depend on that! . . . one of his moods of high good humour had come over him now with a rush; and as was customary with him in that frame of mind, he discussed things with the boys as if they had been grown men. he outlined at length how they could manage their pla

e best. . . . then he told them how he had read in the skandinaven1that the big farmers in the east now built a track under the ridgepole, along which they hauled the hay right into the barn loft. they would have to investigate this idea, for it sounded practical. . . . they found plenty to do up north; they saw to it that the cattle had water and hay enough; they carried in more straw; they stuffed the cracks in the walls; and all the while they talked and worked together like three grown men. per hansa felt the need of throwing off the great burden that weighed him down; and for the moment he seemed to be succeeding fairly well. but at last they had finished everything that needed to be done; then the skis went on in a hurry, and off flew the boys like two great sea gulls soaring across the fiord. . . . no more time for talk! they struck off directly for the highest hill in sight; from there they could slide all the way down to the creek. . . . wasn't it wonderful . . . all this snow!

just as per hansa reached the yard at home sörine was coming out of the kitchen door; she went over to the wall of the house, took a pair of skis that stood there, and put them on. he noticed that she was very thinly clad. she had a shawl over her head, but wore no other outdoor wrap. he concluded at once that she must have left home in a hurry, and feared that the worst had happened. . . . was anything wrong? he asked. . . . no, hans olsa didn't seem much worse; she thought he looked a little better. but her f

ace was sad and she looked down as she spoke. . . . bridget had been to see him again and had said there was no hope. . . . "and i guess there isn't, either," she went on. "but i had to come over and ask your advice, per hansa. . . . he said that you were going after the minister for him. and i suppose that might be a good thing to do; at any rate, he is very happy about it. . . . but now, of course, i see that it's impossible to go anywhere. . . . still, i was thinking that if you did intend to try, it might be better to get the doctor instead. . . . i don't suppose you can think of it in this weather, but i had to come over, anyway. . . ." not once did she look up as the obvious pleading went on.

per hansa glanced

he went on, bravely: "it is so hard to see him go, without being able to help! and then we all have a feeling that nothing is ever impossible for you--and i thought that perhaps you might find a way out of this, too!" . . . all at once her pleading had taken on a frantic urgency.

"did he ask you to come to me?"

"no--he didn't exactly do that. but he kept wondering if you weren't getting ready--if you wouldn't be starting soon. i could see plainly enough that he wanted some one to come over."

per hansa said nothing more, nor did he look at her again. she went away at once. when she had gone, he took off his skis, beat the snow from them, and set them up against the wall. but he did not go in immediately . . . his thoughts followed her who was now walking across the snow, passed her, entered the house before her, saw his friend lying there--saw the great face staring up at him, the frightened eyes imploring him like those of a kindly dog. he stood still in his tracks a long time, gazing off in

e kept looking at them in wonder and dismay. . . . here he sat and played with the child, just as if there were nothing serious in the world for him. the day was wearing on. didn't he really intend to try to do anything? she could have cried aloud in her anguish! had he become stone blind? . . . when she had finished washing the dishes she went to the window and stood there awhile, looking out; then she crossed to the wall where her outdoor clothes hung, and began to put them on. this attracted per hansa's attention.

. . . was she going out? he asked.

. . . yes. . . . she put on one of his coats over her own wrap, then pulled his big stocking cap over her head.

he looked up a second time.

"are you going far? you seem to be wrapping up a good deal."

she waited a moment before she answered.

"i have to talk to henry. . . . some one must go on this errand for hans olsa!" her face was flushed with determination and her eyes shone with a quiet light.

before she knew it he had gone out of the kitchen.

in front of the steps stood the forward part of a sleigh, on which the boys had tried to haul hay to the house; it was a clumsy, homemade affair, so heavy that the boys couldn't budge it after it had stood awhile, and so they had left it where it was. per hansa had noticed it earlier in the day, and it had angered him at the time to think that the boys were so careless. . . . when he came out now this object was the first thing he saw. he rushed at it; wrenched it out of the snow with a violent jerk, and flung it so hard into a drift that only one runner remained in sight.

"there! . . . god damn the thing!" he muttered.

with that passionate outburst his temper seemed suddenly to have left him, but his face was still very pale. his skis leaned up aga

st the wall where he had placed them; he put them on and stood still for a moment, lost in thought; then, staff in hand, he started off. . . .

in the east part of the settlement lived two telemarking1 boys, who had come over a couple of years before. they were skilled skismiths; last winter each one had made himself a pair with straps and staffs, the finest ever seen in this part of the country. this year they had made two trips to town on them before christmas. . . . it was to these boys that per hansa now went. in about an hour he returned with one pair of skis on his shoulders, and another on his feet. neither pair was his own.

beret, greatly agitated by her husband's hasty departure, walked back and forth across the kitchen floor. . . . "now i have brought things to a sorry pass!" she thought. "i know i said too much--but what could i do? some one has to go, and i had no one else to ask." . . . when she saw him returning wi

 have managed with the chores. . . . i must hurry up and make him a cup of coffee; he must have something hot to drink before he leaves. . . . they'll hardly get far to-day." . . . she put the coffeepot on the stove and began to set the table. . . . "i guess i'll put on a tablecloth to make things nice for him. . . . he mustn't think that i hold any hard feelings." . . .

the oldest two boys were busy digging a tunnel from the cow barn to the pigsty--the latter had been completely snowed under. per hansa went over there first; he talked to them as if he were in no hurry, and when it seemed to him that they were losing interest, he went down into the tunnel where they were. . . . he said that now he was going away, and that it was uncertain when he would return. could he depend on them to look after things while he was gone? . . . the boys were absorbed in their task and didn't pay much attention to what he said. certainly he could go. they would look after everything. they went on with their wo

nto a quarrel about how long it would take them to reach the pigsty. . . . he left the boys, took his skis, and went into the granary; there he rubbed one pair of skis with some tallow which he kept for the purpose, and put a piece of the tallow into his pocket. he also had to adjust the straps a little before he could start. . . .

while he was doing this peder victorious came trudging in and announced that mother had made coffee. she said father must come in before it got cold.

"what?" . . . per hansa's face brightened. "did mother really say that?"

"she said coffee was ready."

"oh! . . ."

per hansa had now adjusted the straps as he wanted them, and stood looking around for a rope with which to strap the other pair of skis on his back.

"did she send you out and tell you to say that?" . . .

"she said--she said--coffee was ready, she said!"

the father looked at his son. "you haven't got enough on, permand," he said in a low, tender voice, stroking the boy's cheek with his hand and runnin

g his finger down into the soft warm neck. the boy screamed when it tickled. per hansa laughed to hear him. "hm--hm--cold as an icicle! pack yourself in this minute! . . . so mother has the coffee ready, you say?"

he carried the boy out lovingly, set him down with a lingering touch, and went back after his skis. one pair he tied to his back; the other he put on.

the boy waited, watching him.

"aren't you coming, father?"

"get into the house with you!" the father said with mock severity. "i'll probably be along in a little while." . . . then, as he straightened up and put on hi

s mittens, he suddenly remembered something:

"permand!"

"ya?" . . .

"there's a ball of nice twine in the bedroom. ask mother to find it and give it to you to play with. . . . and now you must be a good boy, and get a lot of threshing done before i come back!"

"yes, father," said the boy as he trotted away.

per hansa stood motionless, watching him until he had passed from sight inside the house. then, with a staff in either hand, he started off. . . . was that a face at the window that he saw? . . .

he did not look at the house again. in a moment he had passed the place where the boys were digging the tunnel; he longed to talk with them once more, but crushed the feeling down. . . . he struck out westward. something tugged and pulled at his heart, trying to make him turn back; it was as if he had a bridle

him! . . . she hurried to the door, flung it open, ran out on the steps, and tried to call to him--he simply mustn't leave this way! . . . but he had already gone beyond the range of her voice; the westerly gusts, driving full against her, snatched her words away. her eyes filled with tears, so that she could scarcely see him now. furious blasts came swirling out of the grey, boundless dusk, sweeping the snow in stinging clouds, whirling it round and round, dropping it only to pick it up again. per hansa soon disappeared in the whirling waste. . . . the wind was so cold that it penetrated to the very marrow of her bones. a little later per hansa turned in at hans olsa's; he sat and talked with them awhile in the bedroom. their words were few and far between. per hansa felt that there was nothing more for him to do here. at length he got up and said that now he was going--what sort of a trip he would have he did not know. if luck were with him, he would bring back the minister. in the meantime h

"i didn't dare to ask you right out," he said, as if in explanation. "but i knew you would go as soon as it was possible--that's always been the way with you. . . . now i can sleep in comfort." . . .
