ile slay more gazers then the basiliske,
ile play the orator as well as nestor,
deceiue more slyly then vlisses could,
and like a synon, take another troy.
i can adde colours to the camelion,
change shapes with proteus, for aduantages,

can i doe this, and cannot get a crowne?

flourish. enter lewis the french king, his sister bona, his
admirall,
call'd bourbon: prince edward, queene margaret, and the earle of
oxford.
lewis sits, and riseth vp againe.

  lewis. faire queene of england, worthy margaret,
sit downe with vs: it ill befits thy state,
and birth, that thou should'st stand, while lewis doth sit

   marg. no, mightie king of france: now margaret
must strike her sayle, and learne a while to serue,
where kings command. i was (i must confesse)
great albions queene, in former golden dayes:
but now mischance hath trod my title downe,
and with dis-hon

 if france can yeeld reliefe

   marg. those gracious words
reuiue my drooping thoughts,
and giue my tongue-ty'd sorrowes leaue to speake.
now therefore be it knowne to noble lewis,
that henry, sole possessor of my loue,
is, of a king, become a banisht man,
and forc'd to liue in scotland a forlorne;
while prowd ambitious edward, duke of yorke,
vsurpes the regall title, and the seat
of englands true anoynted lawfull king.
this is the cause that i, poore margaret,
with this my sonne, prince edward, henries heire,
am come to craue thy iust and lawfull ayde:
and if thou faile vs, all our hope is done.
scotland hath will to helpe, but cannot helpe:
our people, and our peeres, are both mis-led,
our treasure seiz'd, our souldiors put to flight,
and (as thou seest) our selues in heauie plight

   lewis. renowned queene,
with patience calme the storme,
while we bethinke a meanes to breake it off

   marg. the more wee stay, the stronger growes our
foe

   lewis. the more i stay,

ion of my soueraignes heart;
where fame, late entring at his heedfull eares,
hath plac'd thy beauties image, and thy vertue

   marg. king lewis, and lady bona, heare me speake,
before you answer warwicke. his demand
springs not from edwards well-meant honest loue,
but from deceit, bred by necessitie:
for how can tyrants safely gouerne home,
vnlesse abroad they purchase great allyance?
to proue him tyrant, this reason may suffice,
that henry liueth still: but were hee dead,
yet here prince edward stands, king henries sonne.
looke therefore lewis, that by this league and mariage
thou draw not on thy danger, and dis-honor:
for though vsurpers sway the rule a while,
yet heau'ns are iust, and time suppresseth wrongs

   warw. iniurious margaret

   edw. and why not queene?
  warw. because thy father henry did vsurpe,
and thou no more art prince, then shee is queene

   oxf. then warwicke disanulls great iohn of gaunt,
which did subdue the greatest part of spaine;
and after ioh

r fence the right,
now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?
for shame leaue henry, and call edward king

   oxf. call him my king, by whose iniurious doome
my elder brother, the lord aubrey vere
was done to death? and more then so, my father,
euen in the downe-fall of his mellow'd yeeres,
when nature brought him to the doore of death?
no warwicke, no: while life vpholds this arme,
this arme vpholds the house of lancaster

   warw. and i the house of yorke

   lewis. queene margaret, prince edward, and oxford,
vouchsafe at our request, to stand aside,
while i vse further conference with warwicke.

they stand aloofe.

  marg. heauens graunt, that warwickes wordes bewitch
him not

   lew. now warwicke, tell me euen vpon thy conscience
is edward your true king? for i were loth
to linke with him, that were not lawfull chosen

   warw. thereon i pawne my credit, and mine honor

   lewis. but is hee gracious in the peoples eye?
  warw. the more, that henry was vnfortunate

  post. he, more incens'd against your maiestie,
then all the rest, discharg'd me with these words:
tell him from me, that he hath done me wrong,
and therefore ile vncrowne him, er't be long

   king. ha? durst the traytor breath out so prowd words?
well, i will arme me, being thus fore-warn'd:
they shall haue warres, and pay for their presumption.
but say, is warwicke friends with margaret?
  post. i, gracious soueraigne,
they are so link'd in friendship,
that yong prince edward marryes warwicks daughter

   clarence. belike, the elder;
clarence will haue the younger.
now brother king farewell, and sit you fast,
for i will hence to warwickes other daughter,
that though i want a kingdome, yet in marriage
i may not proue inferior to your selfe.
you that loue me, and warwicke, follow me.

exit clarence, and somerset followes.

my thoughts ayme at a further matter:
i stay not for the loue of edward, but the crowne
