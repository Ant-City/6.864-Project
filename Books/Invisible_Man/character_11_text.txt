e anyone could think to stop me.
no one followed me and i wandered the streets amazed at my own
action. later it began to rain and i sneaked back near men's house and
persuaded an amused porter to slip my things out to me. i learned that i
had been barred from the building for "ninety-nine years and a day."
"you might not can come back, man," the porter said, "but after
what you did, i swear, they never will stop talking about you. you really
baptized ole rev!"
so that same night i went back to mary's, where i lived in a small
but comfortable room until the ice came.
it was a period of quietness. i paid my way with my compensation
money and found living with her pleasant except for her constant talk about
leadership and responsibility. and even this was not too bad as long as i
could pay my way. it was, however, a small compensation, and when after
several months my money ran out and i was looking again for a job, i found
her exceedingly irritating to listen to. still, she never dunned me

times, and when you git to be somebody you'll see these here very same hard
times helped you a heap."
i didn't see it that way. i had lost my sense of direction. i spent my
time, when not looking for work, in my room, where i read countless books
from the library. sometimes, when there was still money, or when i had
earned a few dollars waiting table, i'd eat out and wander the streets until
late at night. other than mary i had no friends and desired none. nor did i
think of mary as a "friend"; she was something more -- a force, a stable,
familiar force like something out of my past which kept me from whirling off
into some unknown which i dared not face. it was a most painful position,
for at the same time, mary reminded me constantly that something was
expected of me, some act of leadership, some newsworthy achievement; and i
was torn between resenting her for it and loving her for the nebulous hope

i had no doubt that i could do something, but what, and how? i had
no contacts and i believed in nothing. and the obsession with my identity
which i had developed in the factory hospital returned with a vengeance.
who was i, how had i come to be? certainly i couldn't help being different
from when i left the campus; but now a new, painful, contradictory voice had
grown up within me, and between its demands for revengeful action and
mary's silent pressure i throbbed with guilt and puzzlement. i wanted peace
and quiet, tranquillity, but was too much aboil inside. somewhere beneath the
load of the emotion-freezing ice which my life had conditioned my brain to
produce, a spot of black anger glowed and threw off a hot red light of such
intensity that had lord kelvin known of its existence, he would have had to
revise his measurements. a remote explosion had occurred somewhere,
perhaps back at emerson's or that night in bledsoe's of

ll of snow upon snow. what did
it mean? i walked, my eyes focused into the endless succession of barber
shops, beauty parlors, confectioneries, luncheonettes, fish houses, and hog
maw joints, walking close to the windows, the snowflakes lacing swift
between, simultaneously forming a curtain, a veil, and stripping it aside. a
flash of red and gold from a window filled with religious articles caught my
eye. and behind the film of frost etching the glass i saw two brashly painted
plaster images of mary and jesus surrounded by dream books, love powders,
god-is-love signs, money-drawing oil and plastic dice. a black statue of a
nude nubian slave grinned out at me from beneath a turban of gold. i
passed on to a window decorated with switches of wiry false hair, ointments
guaranteed to produce the miracle of whitening black skin. "you too can be
truly beautiful," a sign proclaimed. "win greater happiness with whiter
complexion. be outstanding in your social set."

made us leave the warm, mild weather of home for all this cold, and never
to return, if not something worth hoping for, freezing for, even being evicted
for? i felt sad. an old woman passed, bent down with two shopping bags, her
eyes upon the slushy walk, and i thought of the old couple at the eviction.
how had it ended and where were they now? what an awful emotion. what
had he called it -- a death on the city pavements? how often did such things
occur? and what would he say of mary? she was far from dead, or of being
ground to bits by new york. hell, she knew very well how to live here, much
better than i with my college training -- training! bledsoing, that was the
term. and i was the one being ground up, not mary. thinking of her made
me feel better. i couldn't imagine mary being as helpless as the old woman
at the eviction, and by the time i reached the apartment i had begun to lose
my depression.

the fumes filling the hall, it struck me that i couldn't realistically reject the
job. cabbage was always a depressing reminder of the leaner years of my
childhood and i suffered silently whenever she served it, but this was the
third time within the week and it dawned on me that mary must be short of
money.
and here i've been congratulating myself for refusing a job, i
thought, when i don't even know how much money i owe her. i felt a quick
sickness grow within me. how could i face her? i went quietly to my room
and lay upon the bed, brooding. there were other roomers, who had jobs,
and i knew she received help from relatives; still there was no mistake, mary
loved a variety of food and this concentration upon cabbage was no accident.
why hadn't i noticed? she'd been too ki

there hearing her, "don't come bothering me with your little troubles, boy.
you'll git something bye and bye" -- when i would try to apologize for not
paying my rent and board. perhaps another roomer had moved, or lost his
job. what were mary's problems anyway; who "articulated her grievances," as
the redheaded man had put it? she had kept me going for months, yet i had
no idea. what kind of man was i becoming? i had taken her so much for
granted that i hadn't even thought of my debt when i refused the job. nor
had i considered the embarrassment i might have caused her should the
police come to her home to arrest me for making that wild speech. suddenly
i felt an urge to go look at her, perhaps i had really never seen her. i had

taking out the crumpled paper, i looked at the telephone number.
he had mentioned an organization. what was it called? i hadn't inquired.
what a fool! at least i should have learned what i was turning down,
although i distrusted the red-headed man. had i refused out of fear as well
as from resentment? why didn't he just tell me what it was all about instead
of trying to impress me with his knowledge?
then from down the hall i could hear mary singing, her voice clear
and untroubled, though she sang a troubled song. it was the "back water
blues." i lay listening as the sound flowed to and around me, bringing me a
calm sense of my indebtedness. when it faded i got up and put on my coat.
perhaps it was not too late. i would find a telephone and call him; then he
could tell me exactly what he wanted and i could make a sensible decision.
mary heard me this time. "boy, when you come home?" she said,
sticking her head out of the kitchen. "

"i came in a short while ago," i said. "you were busy so i didn't

"then where you going so soon, ain't you going to eat supper?"
"yes, mary," i said, "but i've got to go out now. i forgot to take care
of some business."
"shucks! what kind of business you got on a cold night like this?"
she said.
"oh, i don't know, i might have a surprise for you."
"won't nothing surprise me," she said. "and you hurry on back here
and git something hot in your stomach."
going through the cold seeking a telephone booth i realized that i
had committed myself to bring her some kind of surprise, and as i walked i
became mildly enthusiastic. it was, afte

my talent for public speaking, and if the pay was anything at all it would be
more than i had now. at least i could pay mary something of what i owed
her. and she might receive some satisfaction that her prediction had proved
correct.
i seemed to be haunted by cabbage fumes; the little luncheonette in
which i found the telephone was reeking.
brother jack didn't sound at all surprised upon receiving my call.
"i'd like some information about --"
"get here as quickly as you can, we're leaving shortly," he said,
giving me a lenox avenue address and hanging up before i could finish my
request.

thought. the others looked out into the night. it was as though we were
mere chance passengers in a subway car. i felt uneasy, wondering where we
were going, but decided to say nothing. the car shot swiftly over the slush.
looking out at the passing night i wondered what kind of men they
were. certainly they didn't act as though they were heading for a very
sociable evening. i was hungry and i wouldn't get back in time for supper.
well, maybe it would be worth it, both to mary and to me. at least i
wouldn't have to eat that cabbage!
for a moment the car paused for the traffic light, then we were
circling swiftly through long stretches of snow-covered landscape lighted here
and there by street lamps and the nervously stabbing beams of passing cars:
we were flashing through central park, now completely transformed by the
snow. it was as though we had plunged suddenly into mid-country peace, yet
i knew that here, somewhere close by in the night, there was a zoo with its

"you mustn't let that worry you," brother jack said. "you will rise to

they stood up now. i looked at them, fighting a sense of unreality.
they stared at me as the fellows had done when i was being initiated into
my college fraternity. only this was real and now was the time for me to
decide or to say i thought they were crazy and go back to mary's. but what
is there to lose? i thought. at least they've invited me, one of us, in at the
beginning of something big; and besides, if i refused to join them, where
would i goto a job as porter at the railroad station? at least here was a
chance to speak.
"when shall i start?" i said.
"tomorrow, we must waste no time. by the way, where are you
living?"
"i rent a room from a woman in harlem," i said.
"a housewife?"
"she's a widow," i said. "she rents rooms."
"what is her educational background?"

grandfather had been when it was demanded that he quote the entire united
states constitution as a test of his fitness to vote. he had confounded them
all by passing the test, although they still refused him the ballot . . . anyway,
these were different.
it was close to five a.m., many dances and many bourbons later,
when i reached mary's. somehow, i felt surprised that the room was still the
same -- except that mary had changed the bed linen. good old mary. i felt
sadly sobered. and as i undressed i saw my outworn clothes and realized
that i'd have to shed them. certainly it was time. even my hat would go; its
green was sun-faded and brown, like a leaf struck by the winter's snows. i
would require a new one for my new name. a black broad-brimmed one;
perhaps a homburg . . . humbug? i laughed. well, i could leave packing for

travel light, far and fast. they were fast people, all right. what a vast
difference between mary and those for whom i was leaving her. and why
should it be this way, that the very job which might make it possible for me
to do some of the things which she expected of me required that i leave her?
what kind of room would brother jack select for me and why wasn't i left
to select my own? it didn't seem right that in order to become a harlem
leader i should live elsewhere. yet nothing seemed right and i would have to
rely upon their judgment. they seemed expert in such matters.

from the trustees? whatever, i was committed; i'd learn in the process of
working with them, i thought, remembering the money. the bills were crisp
and fresh and i tried to imagine mary's surprise when i paid her all my back
rent and board. she'd think that i was kidding. but money could never repay
her generosity. she would never understand my wanting to move so quickly
after getting a job. and if i had any kind of success at all, it would seem the
height of ingratitude. how would i face her? she had asked for nothing in
return. or hardly anything, except that i make something of myself that she
called a "race leader." i shivered in the cold. telling her that i was moving

ld be a hard proposition. i didn't like to think of it, but one couldn't be
sentimental. as brother jack had said, history makes harsh demands of us
all. but they were demands that had to be met if men were to be the
masters and not the victims of their times. did i believe that? perhaps i had
already begun to pay. besides, i might as well admit right now, i thought,
that there are many things about people like mary that i dislike. for one
thing, they seldom know where their personalities end and yours begins; they
usually think in terms of "we" while i have always tended to think in terms
of "me" -- and that has caused some friction, even with my own family.
brother jack and the others talked in terms of "we," but it was a different,
bigger "we."
well, i had a new name and new problems. i had best leave the old
behind. perhaps it would be best not to see mary at all, just place the money

e was pounding the steam line, and i stared helplessly for
what seemed minutes. my ears throbbed. my side began itching violently and
i tore open my pajamas to scratch, and suddenly the pain seemed to leap
from my ears to my side and i saw gray marks appearing where the old skin
was flaking away beneath my digging nails. and as i watched i saw thin lines
of blood well up in the scratches, bringing pain and joining time and place
again, and i thought, the room has lost its heat on my last day at mary's,
and suddenly i was sick at heart.
the clock, its alarm lost in the larger sound, said seven-thirty, and i
got out of bed. i'd have to hurry. there was shopping to do before i called
brother jack for my instructions and i had to get the money to mary -- why
didn't they stop that noise? i reached for my shoes, flinching as the knocking
seemed to sound an inch above my head. why don't they stop, i thought.
and why do i feel so let down? the bourbon? my nerves going bad?
suddenly i was across th

 eyes stared up at me from the floor, his face an
enormous grin, his single large black hand held palm up before his chest. it
was a bank, a piece of early americana, the kind of bank which, if a coin is
placed in the hand and a lever pressed upon the back, will raise its arm and
flip the coin into the grinning mouth. for a second i stopped, feeling hate
charging within me, then dashed over and grabbed it, suddenly as enraged by
the tolerance or lack of discrimination, or whatever, that allowed mary to
keep such a self-mocking image around, as by the knocking.
in my hand its expression seemed more of a strangulation than a
grin. it was choking, filled to the throat with coins.
how the hell did it get here, i wondered, dashing over and striking
the pipe a blow with the kinky iron head. "shut up!" i screamed, which
seemed only to enrage the hidden knocker. the din was deafening. tenants
up and down the entire line of apartments joined in. i hammered back with
the iron naps, seeing the silver

who started all this, i wondered, who's responsible?
"why don't you act like responsible people living in the twentieth
century?" i yelled, aiming a blow at the pipe. "get rid of your cottonpatch
ways! act civilized!"
then came a crash of sound and i felt the iron head crumble and fly
apart in my hand. coins flew over the room like crickets, ringing, rattling
against the floor, rolling. i stopped dead.
"just listen to 'em! just listen to 'em!" mary called from the hall.
"enough noise to wake the dead! they know when the heat don't come up
that the super's drunk or done walked off the job looking for his woman, or
something. why don't folks act according to what they know?"
she was at my door now, knocking stroke for stroke with the blows
landing on the pipe, calling, "son! ain't some of that knocking coming from
in there?"
i turned from side to side in indecision, looking at the pieces of
broken head, the small coins of all denominations

that were scattered about.
"you hear me, boy?" she called.
"what is it?" i called, dropping to the floor and reaching frantically
for the broken pieces, thinking, if she opens the door, i'm lost . . .
"i said is any of that racket coming from in there?"
"yes, it is, mary," i called, "but i'm all right . . . i'm already awake."
i saw the knob move and froze, hearing, "sounded to me like a heap
of it was coming from in there. you got your clothes on?"
"no," i cried. "i'm just dressing. i'll have them on in a minute."
"come on out to the kitchen," she said. "it's warm out there. and
there's some hot water on the stove to wash your face in . . . and some
coffee. lawd, just listen at the racket!"
i stood as though frozen, until she moved away from the door. i'd

ering jagged fragments of painted iron among the
coins. i looked at my hand; a small trickle of blood showed. i wiped it away,
thinking, i'll have to hide this mess! i can't take her this and the news that
i'm moving at the same time. taking a newspaper from the chair i folded it
stiffly and swept the coins and broken metal into a pile. where would i hide
it, i wondered, looking with profound distaste at the iron kinks, the dull red
of a piece of grinning lip. why, i thought with anguish, would mary have
something like this around anyway? just why? i looked under the bed. it was
dustless there, no place to hide anything. she was too good a housekeeper.
besides, what of the coins? hell! maybe the thing was left by the former
roomer. anyway, whose ever it was, it had to be hidden. there was the
closet, but she'd find it there too. after i was gone a few days she'd clean
out my things and there it'd be. the knocking had gone beyond mere protest
over heatlessness now, they had fallen into a ra

vibrating the very floor.
"just a few minutes more, you bastards," i said aloud, "and i'll be
gone! no respect for the individual. why don't you think about those who
might wish to sleep? what if someone is near a nervous breakdown . . . ?"
but there was still the package. there was nothing to do but get rid
of it along the way downtown. making a tight bundle, i placed it in my
overcoat pocket. i'd simply have to give mary enough money to cover the
coins. i'd give her as much as i could spare, half of what i had, if necessary.
that should make up for some of it. she should appreciate that. and now i
realized with a feeling of dread that i had to meet her face to face. there
was no way out. why can't i just tell her that i'm leaving and pay her and
go on off? she was a landlady, i was a tenant -- no, there was more to it
and i wasn't hard enough, scientific enough, even to tell her that i was

and cooled it from the spigot. i kept the tear-warm water upon my face a
long time, then dried and returned to the kitchen.
"run it full again," she said when i returned. "how you feel?"
"so-so," i said.
she sat with her elbows upon the enameled table top, her cup held
in both hands, one work-worn little finger delicately curved. i went to the
sink and turned the spigot, feeling the cold rush of water upon my hand,
thinking of what i had to do . . .
"that's enough there, boy," mary said, startling me. "wake up!"
"i guess i'm not all here," i said. "my mind was wandering."
"well, call it back and come get you some coffee. soon's i've had
mine, i'll see what kind of breakfast i can whip together. i guess after last
night you can eat this morning. you didn't come back for supper."
"i'm sorry," i said. "coffee will be enough for me."
"boy, you better start eating again," she warned, pouring me a full
cup of coffee.
i took the cup and sipped it, black. it was bitter. she glanc

cup, looking into it.
"guess i'll have to get some better filters," she mused. "these i got

know though, even with the best of filters you apt to find a ground or two at
the bottom of your cup."
i blew upon the steaming liquid, avoiding mary's eyes. the knocking
was becoming unbearable again. i'd have to get away. i looked at the hot
metallic surface of the coffee, noticing on oily, opalescent swirl.
"look, mary," i said, plunging in, "i want to talk to you about
something."
"now see here, boy," she said gruffly, "i don't want you worrying me
about your rent this morning. i'm not worried 'cause when you get it i know
you'll pay me. meanwhile you forget it. nobody in this house is going to

"well, i de-clare -- let me get down from up here before i fall and

the rest i'm going to save for you. you get hard up just come to mary."
"i think i'll be all right now," i said, watching her fold the money
carefully, placing it in the leather bag that always hung on the back of her
chair.
"i'm really glad, 'cause now i can take care of that bill they been
bothering me about. it'll do me so much good to go in there and plop down
some money and tell them folks to quit bothering me. son, i believe your

i saw a small drove of roaches trooping frantically down the steam
line from the floor above, plummeting to the floor as the vibration of the
pipe shook them off.
"get the broom!" mary yelled. "out of the closet there!"
stepping around the chair i snatched the broom and joined her,
splattering the scattering roaches with both broom and feet, hearing the pop
and snap as i brought the pressure down upon them vehemently.
"the filthy, stinking things," mary cried. "git that one under the
table! yon' he goes, don't let him git away! the nasty rascal!"
i swung the broom, battering and sweeping the squashed insects into
piles. breathing excitedly mary got the dust pan and handed it

she laughed gaily and i went down the hall to my room and closed
the door. pulling on my overcoat i got down my prized brief case from the
closet. it was still as new as the night of the battle royal, and sagged now as
i placed the smashed bank and coins inside and locked the flap. then i
closed the closet door and left.
the knocking didn't bother me so much now. mary was singing
something sad and serene as i went down the hall, and still singing as i
opened the door and stepped into the outside hall. then i remembered, and
there beneath the dim hall light i took the faintly perfumed paper from my
wallet and carefully unfolded it. a tremor passed over me; the hall was cold.
then it was gone and i squinted and took a long, hard look at my new
brotherhood name.
the night's snowfall was already being churned to muck by the
passing cars, and it was warmer. joini

could feel the brief case swinging against my leg from the weight of the
package, and i determined to get rid of the coins and broken iron at the first
ash can. i needed nothing like this to remind me of my last morning at
mary's.
i made for a row of crushed garbage cans lined before a row of old
private houses, coming alongside and tossing the package casually into one of
them and moving on -- only to hear a door open behind me and a voice ring
out,
"oh, no you don't, oh, no you don't! just come right back here and
get it!"
turning, i saw a little woman standing on the stoop with a green
coat covering her head and shoulders, its sleeves hanging limp like extra
atrophied arms.

on the subway people around me were reading their morning papers,
pressing forward their unpleasant faces. i rode with my eyes shut, trying to
make my mind blank to thoughts of mary. then turning, i saw the item
violent protest over harlem eviction, just as the man lowered his paper and
moved out of the breaking doors. i could hardly wait until i reached 42nd

read it eagerly. i was referred to only as an unknown "rabble rouser" who
had disappeared in the excitement, but that it referred to me was
unmistakable. it had lasted for two hours, the crowd refusing to vacate the

tonight . . . how was it? perhaps simply to be known, to be looked upon by
so many people, to be the focal point of so many concentrating eyes, perhaps
this was enough to make one different; enough to transform one into
something else, someone else; just as by becoming an increasingly larger boy
one became one day a man; a man with a deep voice -- although my voice
had been deep since i was twelve. but what if someone from the campus
wandered into the audience? or someone from mary's -- even mary herself?
"no, it wouldn't change it," i heard myself say softly, "that's all past." my
name was different; i was under orders. even if i met mary on the street, i'd
have to pass her by unrecognized. a depressing thought -- and i got up
abruptly and went out of the dressing room and into the alley.
without my overcoat it was cold. a feeble light burned above the
entrance, sparkling the snow. i crossed the alley to the dark side, stopping

. i almost laughed into the phone when i heard the
director of men's house address me with profound respect. my new name
was getting around. it's very strange, i thought, but things are so unreal for
them normally that they believe that to call a thing by name is to make it
so. and yet i am what they think i am . . .
our work went so well that a few sundays later we threw a parade
that clinched our hold on the community. we worked feverishly. and now the
clashing and conflict of my last days at mary's seemed to have moved out
into the struggles of the community, leaving me inwardly calm and controlled.
even the hustle and bustle of picketing and speechmaking seemed to
stimulate me for the better; my wildest ideas paid off.
upon hearing that one of the unemployed brothers was an ex-drill
master from wichita, kansas, i organized a drill team of six-footers whose
duty it was to march through the streets striking up sparks with their
hobnailed shoes. on the day of the parade they drew crowds f

was going out of its way to make my name prominent. articles, telegrams
and many mailings went out over my signature -- some of which i'd written,
but most not. i was publicized, identified with the organization both by word
and image in the press. on the way to work one late spring morning i
counted fifty greetings from people i didn't know, becoming aware that there
were two of me: the old self that slept a few hours a night and dreamed
sometimes of my grandfather and bledsoe and brockway and mary, the self
that flew without wings and plunged from great heights; and the new public
self that spoke for the brotherhood and was becoming so much more
important than the other that i seemed to run a foot race against myself.
still, i liked my work during those days of certainty. i kept my eyes
wide and ears alert. the brotherhood was a world within a world and i was
determined to discover all its secrets and to advance as far as i could. i saw
no limits, it was the one organization in the whole

rother tarp could explain; or at least tell me something about
clifton.
i walked through the dark block over to seventh and started down;
things were beginning to look serious. along the way i saw not a single sign
of brotherhood activity. in a hot side street i came upon a couple striking
matches along the curb, kneeling as though looking for a lost coin, the
matches flaring dimly in their faces. then i found myself in a strangely
familiar block and broke out in a sweat: i had walked almost to mary's door,
and turned now and hurried away.
barrelhouse had prepared me for the darkened windows of the
district, but not, when i let myself in, to call in vain through the dark to
brother tarp. i went to the room where he slept, but he was not there; then
i went through the dark hall to my old office and threw myself into my desk
chair, exhausted. everything seemed to be slipping away from me and i could
find no quick absorbing action that would get it under control. i tried to
think of whom amon

i looked toward the curtain of blue fire, through which vague figures
toiled. dupre called out and several men left the crowd and joined us in the
street. we moved off, my friend (scofield, the others called him) leading me
along. my head throbbed, still bled.
"looks like you got you some loot too," he said, pointing to my brief
case.
"not much," i said, thinking, loot? loot? and suddenly i knew why
it was heavy, remembering mary's broken bank and the coins; and now i
found myself opening the brief case and dropping all my papers -- my
brotherhood identification, the anonymous letter, along with clifton's doll --
into it.
"fill it up, man. don't you be bashful. you wait till we tackle one of
these pawnshops. that du's got him a cotton-picking sack fulla stuff. he
could go into business."
"well, i'll be damn," a man on the other side of me said. "i thought
that was a cotton sack. where'd he get that thing?"
"he brought i

ahead. they came behind me like a draft of flames and i led them through
and around to the avenue, and if they'd fired they could have had me, but it
was important to them that they hang me, lynch me even, since that was the
way they ran, had been taught to run. i should die by hanging alone, as
though only hanging would settle things, even the score. so i ran expecting
death between the shoulder blades or through the back of my head, and as i
ran i was trying to get to mary's. it was not a decision of thought but
something i realized suddenly while running over puddles of milk in the black
street, stopping to swing the heavy brief case and the leg chain, slipping and
sliding out of their hands.
if only i could turn around and drop my arms and say, "look, men,
give me a break, we're all black folks together . . . nobody cares." though
now i knew we cared, they at last cared enough to act -- so i thought. if
only i could say, "look, they've played a trick on us, the

new variations -- let's stop running and respect and love one another . . ." if
only -- i thought, running into another crowd now and thinking i'd gotten
away, only to catch a punch on my jaw as one closed in shouting, and
feeling the leg chain bounce as i caught his head and spurted forward,
turning out of the avenue only to be struck by a spray of water that seemed
to descend from above. it was a main that had burst, throwing a fierce
curtain of spray into the night. i was going for mary's but i was moving
downtown through the dripping street rather than up, and, as i started
through, a mounted policeman charged through the spray, the horse black
and dripping, charging through and looming huge and unreal, neighing and
clopping across the pavement upon me now as i slipped to my knees and
saw the huge pulsing bulk floating down upon and over me, the sound of
hooves and screams and a rush of water coming through distantly as though
i sat remote in a padded room, then over, almost

elplessly; and now moving straight into the full, naked
force of the water, feeling its power like a blow, wet and thudding and cold,
then through it and able partly to see just as another horse dashed up and
through, a hunter taking a barrier, the rider slanting backward, the horse
rising, then hit and swallowed by the rising spray. i stumbled down the
street, the comet tail in my eyes, seeing a little better now and looking back
to see the water spraying like a mad geyser in the moonlight. to mary, i
thought, to mary.
there were rows of iron fences backed by low hedges before the
houses and i stumbled behind them and lay panting to rest from the
crushing force of the water. but hardly had i settled down, the dry, dog-day
smell of the hedge in my nose, when they stopped before the house, leaning
upon the fence. they were passing a bottle around and their voices sounded
spent of strong emotion.
"this is some night," one of them said. "ain't this some night?"
"it's 'bout like the rest."

he way it's always been, only
now i know it -- and rested back, calm now, placing the brief case beneath
my head. i could open it in the morning, push off the lid. now i was tired,
too tired; my mind retreating, the image of the two glass eyes running
together like blobs of melting lead. here it was as though the riot was gone
and i felt the tug of sleep, seemed to move out upon black water.
it's a kind of death without hanging, i thought, a death alive. in the
morning i'll remove the lid . . . mary, i should have gone to mary's. i would
go now to mary's in the only way that i could . . . i moved off over the
black water, floating, sighing . . . sleeping invisibly.
but i was never to reach mary's, and i was over-optimistic about
removing the steel cap in the morning. great invisible waves of time flowed
over me, but that morning never came. there was no morning nor light of
any kind to awaken me and i slept on and on until finally i was aroused by
hunger. then i was up in the dark and blun

and i awoke in the blackness.
fully awake now, i simply lay there as though paralyzed. i could
think of nothing else to do. later i would try to find my way out, but now i
could only lie on the floor, reliving the dream. all their faces were so vivid
that they seemed to stand before me beneath a spotlight. they were all up
there somewhere, making a mess of the world. well, let them. i was through
and, in spite of the dream, i was whole.
and now i realized that i couldn't return to mary's, or to any part of
my old life. i could approach it only from the outside, and i had been as
invisible to mary as i had been to the brotherhood. no, i couldn't return to
mary's, or to the campus, or to the brotherhood, or home. i could only move
ahead or stay here, underground. so i would stay here until i was chased
out. here, at least, i could try to think things out in peace, or, if not in
peace, in quiet. i would take up residence underground. the end was in the
beginning.
