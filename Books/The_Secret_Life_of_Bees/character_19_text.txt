his  mouth  formed  the word  "oh,"  but he didn't 
actually say it; he was too busy looking at rosaleen in his 
church,  rosaleen  who  chose  this  moment  to  spit  into 
her snuff jug. 

it's funny how you forget the rules. she was not 
supposed  to  be  inside  here.  every  time  a  rumor  got  
going about a group of negroes coming to worship with 
us  on  sunday morning, the deacons  stood  locked-arms 
across  the  church  steps  to  turn  them  away.  we  loved  
them in the lord, brother gerald said, but they had their 
own places. 

"today's my birthday," i said, hoping to send his 

thoughts in a new direction. 

"is it? well, happy birthday, lily. so how old are 

you now?" 

"fourteen." 
"ask him if we  can have a couple of  these fans 

for your birthday present," said rosaleen. 

he made a thin sound, intended for a laugh. 
"now,  if  we  let  everybody  borrow  a  fan  that  

wanted one, the church wouldn't have a fan left." 

"she  was  just  kidding,"  i said,  and  stood  u

the door, with rosaleen tagging behind.

outside,  the  sky  had  whited  over  with  clouds, 
and  shine  spilled  across  the  surfaces,  sending  motes 
before my eyes. when we'd cut through the parsonage 
yard and were back on the highway, rosaleen produced 
two church fans from the bosom of her dress, and, doing 
an impersonation of me gazing up sweet-faced, she said, 
"oh, brother gerald, she was just kidding."

we came into sylvan on the worst side of town. 
old houses set up on cinder blocks. fans wedged in the 
windows.  dirt  yards.  women  in  pink  curlers.  collarless 
dogs. 

after  a  few  blocks  we  approached  the  esso 
station  on  the  corner  of  west  market  and  park  street,  
generally recognized as a catchall place for men with too 
much time on their hands. 

i  noticed  that  not  a  single  car  was  getting  gas. 
three men sat in dinette

enough to send her a nice picture of jesus' mother. and 
who would ever think to look for us there? 

i  squatted  beside  the  ditch  and  unfolded  the 
map. tiburon was a pencil dot beside the big red star of 
columbia.  t.  ray  would  check  the  bus  station,  so 
rosaleen and i would have to hitchhike. how hard could 
that  be?  you  stand  there  with  your  thumb  out  and  a 
person takes pity on you. 

a short distance past the church, brother gerald 
whizzed  by  in  his  white  ford.  i  saw  his  brake  lights 
flicker. he backed up. "i thought that was you," he said 
through the window. 

"where're you headed?" 
"town." 
"again? what's the bag for?" 
"i'm… i'm taking some things to rosaleen. she's 

in jail." 

"yeah,  i  know,"  he  said,  flinging  open  the 

passenger door. 

"get in, i'm heading there myself." 
i'd never been inside a preacher's car before. it's 
not  that  i  expected  a  ton  of  bibles  stacked  on  the 
backs

brother  gerald,  because  they  yelled  at  her  to  shut  up 
with that blankety-blank jesus tune. rosaleen said, "you 
can curse me, but don't blaspheme the lord jesus."

but  they  kept  right  on.  so  she  poured  the  juice 
from  her  snuff  cup  on  their  shoes.  maybe  she  was 
wrong, but in her mind she was standing up for jesus." i 
was sweating through my top and all along the backs of 
my thighs. 

brother gerald dragged his teeth back and forth 
across his lip. i could tell he was actually weighing what 
i'd said. 

mr.  gaston  was  in  the  station  alone,  eating 
boiled  peanuts  at  his  desk,  when  brother  gerald  and  i 
came through the door. being the sort of person he was, 
mr. gaston had shells all over the floor. 

"your  colored  woman  ain't  here,"  he  said, 
looking  at  me.  "i  took  her  to  the  hospital  for  stitches.  
she took a fall and hit her head."

ear  end.  i  wanted  to  throw  his  

boiled peanuts against the wall. 

i  could  not  keep  myself  from  shouting  at  him. 

"what do you mean, she fell and hit her head?" 

mr.  gaston looked over  at brother gerald, that 
all-knowing  look  men  give  each  other  when  a  female 
acts the least bit hysterical. 

"settle down, now," he said to me. 
"i can't settle down till i know if she's all right," i 

said, my voice calmer but still shaking a little.

she'll be back here later this evening. the doctor wanted 
her watched for a few hours."
