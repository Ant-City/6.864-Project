[CHARACTER] - 
                a
friend of caesar. [CHARACTER] claims allegiance to brutus and the conspirators
after caesar's death in order to save his own life. later, however,
when speaking a funeral oration over caesar's body, he spectacularly persuades
the audience to withdraw its support of brutus and instead condemn
him as a traitor. with tears on his cheeks and caesar's will in
his hand, [CHARACTER] engages masterful rhetoric to stir the crowd to revolt
against the conspirators. [CHARACTER]'s desire to exclude lepidus from
the power that [CHARACTER] and octavius intend to share hints at his
own ambitious nature.
