    is now gone home, that wishes to live longer!
     feels not his gout, nor palsy; feigns himself
     younger by scores of years, flatters his age
     with confident belying it, hopes he may,
     with charms, like aeson, have his youth restored:
     and with these thoughts so battens, as if fate
     would be as easily cheated on, as he,
     and all turns air!

     who's that there, now? a third?

     mos: close, to your couch again; i hear his voice:
     it is corvino, our spruce merchant.

     volp [lies down as before.]: dead.

     mos: another bout, sir, with your eyes.

     --who's there?

     signior corvino! come most wish'd for! o,
     how happy were you, if you knew it, now!

     corv: why? what? wherein?

     mos: the tardy hour is come, sir.

     corv: he is not dead?

     mos: not dead, sir, but as good;
     he knows no man.

     corv: how shall i do then?

     mos: perhaps he has
     so much remembrance left, as to know you, sir:
     he still calls on you; nothing but your name
     is in his mouth: is your pearl orient, sir?

     corv: venice was never owner of the like.

     volp [faintly.]: signior corvino.

     mos: hark.

     volp: signior corvino!

     mos: he calls you; step and give it him.--he's here, sir,
     and he has brought you a rich pearl.

     corv: how do you, sir?
     tell him, it doubles the twelfth caract.

     mos: sir,
     he cannot understand, his hearing's gone;
     and yet it comforts him to see you--

     corv: say,
     i have a diamond for him, too.

     mos: best shew it, sir;
     put it into his hand; 'tis only there
     he apprehends: he has his feeling, yet.
     see how he grasps it!

as, good gentleman!
     how pitiful the sight is!

     mos: tut! forget, sir.
     the weeping of an heir should still be laughter
     under a visor.

     corv: why, am i his heir?

     mos: sir, i am sworn, i may not shew the will,
     till he be dead; but, here has been corbaccio,
     here has been voltore, here were others too,
     i cannot number 'em, they were so many;
     all gaping here for legacies: but i,
     taking the vantage of his naming you,
     "signior corvino, signior corvino," took
     paper, and pen, and ink, and there i asked him,
     whom he would have his heir? "corvino." who
     should be executor? "corvino." and,
     to any question he was silent too,
     i still interpreted the nods he made,
     through weakness, for consent: and sent home th' others,
     nothing bequeath'd them, but to cry and curse.

     mos: i told the squire so much.

     volp: when i am high with mirth and wine; then, then:
     'fore heaven, i wonder at the desperate valour
     of the bold english, that they dare let loose
     their wives to all encounters!

     mos: sir, this knight
     had not his name for nothing, he is politick,
     and knows, howe'er his wife affect strange airs,
     she hath not yet the face to be dishonest:
     but had she signior corvino's wife's face--

     volp: has she so rare a face?

     mos: o, sir, the wonder,
     the blazing star of italy! a wench
     of the first year! a beauty ripe as harvest!
     whose skin is whiter than a swan all over,
     than silver, snow, or lilies! a soft lip,
     would tempt you to eternity of kissing!
     and flesh that melteth in the touch to blood!
     bright as your gold, and lovely as your gold!

     volp: why had not i known this before?

     upon his fellow, and have all their charge,
     when he goes out, when he comes in, examined.

     volp: i will go see her, though but at her window.

     mos: in some disguise, then.

     volp: that is true; i must
     maintain mine own shape still the same: we'll think.

     you might forget it, and then they prevent us.

     is shame fled human breasts? that with such ease,
     men dare put off your honours, and their own?
     is that, which ever was a cause of life,
     now placed beneath the basest circumstance,
     and modesty an exile made, for money?

     volp: why, sir?

     volp: you mock the world, sir; did you not change wills?

     you grow not mad withal: i love your spirit:
     you are not over-leaven'd with your fortune.
     you should have some would swell now, like a wine-fat,
     with such an autumn--did he give you all, sir?

     corb: avoid, you rascal!

     volp: troth, your wife has shewn
     herself a very woman; but you are well,
     you need not care, you have a good estate,
     to bear it out sir, better by this chance:
     except corbaccio have a share.

     well, what i'll do--

     i e'en rejoice, sir, at your worship's happiness,
     and that it fell into so learned hands,
     that understand the fingering--

     this is the truth, though i'll not justify
     the other, but he may be some-deal faulty.
