feel a bit lightheaded.

even  more  so  than  with  the  theories  of  relativity,  it  is  hard  to  embrace  quantum  mechanics
viscerallyâ€”to  think  like  a  miniature  person  born  and  raised  in  the  microscopic  realm.  there  is,
though, one aspect of the theory that can act as a guidepost for your intuition, as it is the hallmark
feature  that  fundamentally  differentiates  quantum  from  classical  reasoning.  it  is  the uncertainty
principle, discovered by the german physicist werner heisenberg in 1927.

this principle grows out of an objection that may have occurred to you earlier. we noted that the
act of determining the slit through which each electron passes (its position) necessarily disturbs its
subsequent motion (its velocity). but just as we can assure ourselves of someone's presence either by
gently touching them or by giving them an overzealous slap on the back, why can't we determine the
electron's position with an "ever gentler" light source in order to have an ever decreas
