during the last thirty years of his life, albert einstein sought relentlessly for a so-called unified field
theory—a  theory  capable  of  describing  nature's  forces  within  a  single,  all-encompassing,  coherent
framework. einstein was not motivated by the things we often associate with scientific undertakings,
such  as  trying  to  explain  this  or  that  piece  of  experimental  data.  instead,  he  was  driven  by  a
passionate belief that the deepest understanding of the universe would reveal its truest wonder: the
simplicity  and  power  o

a central thread in what follows will be those developments that carry forward the revolution in our
understanding of space and time initiated by einstein's special and general theories of relativity. we
will see that if string theory is correct, the fabric of our universe has properties that would likely have
dazzled even einstein.

space, time, and the eye of the beholder

in june 1905, twenty-six-year-old albert einstein submitted a technical article to the german annals
of  physics  in  which  he  came  to  grips  with  a  paradox  about  light  that  had  first  troubled  him  as  a
teenager, some ten years earlier. upon turning the final page of einstein's manuscript, the editor of the
journal, max planck, realized that the accepted scientific order had been overthrown. without hoopla
or fanfare, a patent clerk from bern, switzerland, had completely overturned the traditional notions of
space  and  time  and

nuniform "real" gravitational field created by some collection of massive bodies is known
as  the  "tidal"  gravitational  field  (since  it  accounts  for  the  moon's  gravitational  effect  on  tides  on
earth). this endnote, therefore, can be summarized by saying that tidal gravitational fields become
less noticeable as the size of your compartment gets smaller, making accelerated motion and a "real"
gravitational field indistinguishable.

overlooked it. new, highly sensitive gravitational experiments will look for such "large" curled-up
dimensions in the near future. a positive result would be one of the greatest discoveries of all time.
