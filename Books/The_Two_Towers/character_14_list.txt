Shelob - 
                    	An
unimaginably ancient, enormous, and evil female spider that lives
in the tunnels near Mordor, ever hungry for prey. Shelob, who is
even older than Sauron, serves as a kind of guard for one of the
entrances to Mordor. Gollum deceitfully leads Frodo and Sam into Shelob's
lair, where the spider paralyzes Frodo and nearly kills both hobbits
before Sam drives her away.
