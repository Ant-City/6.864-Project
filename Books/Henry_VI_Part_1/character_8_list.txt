Suffolk - 
      Suffolk is an English lord who captures Margaret after the French are defeated and is so impressed with her that he is determined to woo her. But he is married, so he woos her for Henry, and then convinces Henry to marry her. Thus, the new queen is a woman he has handpicked--a woman with whom he is intimate, a woman over who trusts and listens to him: Suffolk plans to influence the British reign by way of this connection.
