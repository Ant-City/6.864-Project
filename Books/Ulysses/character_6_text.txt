mrs marion.

entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm
yellow twilight towards her tousled head.

—who are the letters for?

he looked at them. mullingar. milly.

—a letter for me from milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. and a
letter for you.

he laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her
knees.

—do you want the blind up?

letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her
glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.

she was reading the card, propped on her elbow.

indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. from
somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and
crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained
its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain,
sleeping.

had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member
of his family?

twice, in holles street and in ontario terrace, his daughter millicent

of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night
attire with a vacant mute expression.

constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf

issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a
plait of her hair (cf earwashing cat). furthermore, silly milly, she
dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse
whose name had been joseph to whom (which) she had offered a
tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf
hearthdreaming cat). hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of
tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.

above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of

p into you because thats all
they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye i had
to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in
him when i made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is
so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last
time i let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for
him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it
themselves theyd know what i went through with milly nobody would
believe cutting her teeth too and mina purefoys husband give us a swing
out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year
as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one
they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on
it jesusjack the child is a black the last time i was there a squad of
them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears
supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swolle

o give him a tiny bit cut off
my drawers that was the evening coming along kenilworth square he kissed
me in the eye of my glove and i had to take it off asking me questions
is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so i let him keep it
as if i forgot it to think of me when i saw him slip it into his pocket
of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen
always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their
skirts blowing up to their navels even when milly and i were out with
him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right
against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me
from behind following in the rain i saw him before he saw me however
standing at the corner of the harolds cross road with a new raincoat on
him with the muffler in the zingari colours to show off his complexion
and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there
where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like

he has nymphs used they go about like that i asked him about her and
that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some
jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply
the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of
the pan all for his kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his
teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple i had to scream out arent
they fearful trying to hurt you i had a great breast of milk with milly
enough for two what was the reason of that he said i could have got a
pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate
looking student that stopped in no 28 with the citrons penrose nearly
caught me washing through the window only for i snapped up the towel to
my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he
got doctor brady to give me the belladonna prescription i had to get him
to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than

the bulls and cows they were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that
noisy bugger trying to swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his
hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken
bottles for a poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his
cheques or some advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him
addressed dear madam only his letter and the card from milly this
morning see she wrote a letter to him who did i get the last letter from

one she had lunita laredo the fun we had running along williss road to
europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of jersey they
were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like millys little ones now
when she runs up the stairs i loved looking down at them i was jumping
up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and
throwing them at him he went to india he was to write the voyages those
men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they
might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be
drowned or blown up somewhere i went up windmill hill to the flats

old woman to murder her in her bed id cut them off him so i would not
that hed be much use still better than nothing the night i was sure
i heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a
candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet
frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could
for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the lord knows
still its the feeling especially now with milly away such an idea for
him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account
of his grandfather instead of sending her to skerrys academy where shed
have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like
that all the same on account of me and boylan thats why he did it im
certain the way he plots and plans everything out i couldnt turn round
with her in the place lately unless i bolted the door first gave me the
fidgets coming in without knocking first when i

 the one thing gold
maybe what a question if i smathered it all over his wrinkly old face
for him with all my compriments i suppose hed know then and could you
pass it easily pass what i thought he was talking about the rock of
gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the
way only i like letting myself down after in the hole as far as i can
squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles
still theres something in it i suppose i always used to know by millys
when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same
paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking
me had i frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words
they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways i
wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or god knows what else
still i liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so
severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap o

with a married woman thats why he wants me and boylan though as for her
denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call

with him with milly at the college races that hornblower with the childs
bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing
his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down i tried to

at that and didnt i dream something too yes there was something about
poetry in it i hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or
standing up like a red indian what do they go about like that for only
getting themselves and their poetry laughed at i always liked poetry
when i was a girl first i thought he was a poet like lord byron and not
an ounce of it in his composition i thought he was quite different i
wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 i was married 88 milly is 15
yesterday 89 what age was he then at dillons 5 or 6 about 88 i suppose
hes 20 or more im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 i hope hes not
that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting
down in the old kitchen with him taking eppss cocoa and talking of

out of trinity college hes very young to be a professor i hope hes not
