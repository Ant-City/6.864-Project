sprinkled salt on porch steps. but aside from one or two
unsuccessful efforts to collect the dust from her footsteps,
they did nothing to harm her. as always the black people
looked at evil stony-eyed and let it run. sula acknowledged
none of their attempts at counterconjure or their gossip and
seemed to need the services of nobody. so they watched
her far more closely than they watched any other roach or
bitch in the town, and their alertness was gratified. things
began to happen. first off, teapot knocked on her door to
see if she had any bottles. he was the five-year-old son of
an indifferent mother, all of whose interests sat around the
door of the time and a half pool hall. her name was betty
but she was called teapot's mamma because being his
mamma was precisely her major failure. when sula said
no, the boy turned around and fell down the steps. he
couldn't get up right away and sula went to help him. his
mother, just then tripping home, saw sula bending over her
son's pained face. s

he flew into a fit of concerned, if
drunken, motherhood, and dragged teapot home. she told
everybody that sula had pushed him, and talked so strongly
about it she was forced to abide by the advice of her
friends and take him to the county hospital. the two dollars
she hated to release turned out to be well spent, for teapot
did have a fracture, although the doctor said poor diet had
contributed substantially to the daintiness of his bones.
teapot's mamma got a lot of attention anyway and
immersed herself in a role she had shown no inclination for:
motherhood. the very idea of a grown woman hurting her
boy kept her teeth on edge. she became the most devoted
mother: sober, clean and industrious. no more nickels for
teapot to go to dick's for a breakfast of mr. goodbars and
soda pop: no more long hours of him alone or wandering
the roads while she was otherwise engaged. her change
was a distinct improvement, although little teapot did miss

those quiet times at dick's. other things happened. mr.
finley sat on his porch sucking chicken bones, as he had
done for thirteen years, looked up, saw sula, choked on a
bone and died on the spot. that incident, and teapot's
mamma, cleared up for everybody the meaning of the
birthmark over her eye; it was not a stemmed rose, or a
snake, it was hannah's ashes marking her from the very
beginning. she came to their church suppers without
underwear, bought their steaming platters of food and
merely picked at it--relishing nothing, exclaiming over no
one's ribs or cobbler. they believed that she was laughing
at their god. and the fury she created in the women of the
town was incredible--for she would lay their husband

, and those over had chilblains, rheumatism, pleurisy,
earaches and a world of other ailments. still it was not
those illnesses or even the ice that marked the beginning of
the trouble, that self-fulfilled prophecy that shadrack carried
on his tongue. as soon as the silvering began, long before
the cider cracked the jugs, there was something wrong. a
falling away, a dislocation was taking place. hard on the
heels of the general relief that sula's death brought a
restless irritability took hold. teapot, for example, went into
the kitchen and asked his mother for some sugar-butterbread.
she got up to fix it and found that she had no butter,
only oleomargarine. too tired to mix the saffron-colored
powder into the hard cake of oleo, she simply smeared the
white stuff on the bread and sprinkled the sugar over it.
teapot tasted the difference and refused to eat it. this
keenest of insults that a mother can feel, the rejection by a
child of her food, bent her into fury and she beat him as she

number 7 and danced a little
jig around the befuddled shadrack, then cut into a wild
aping of his walk, his song and his bell-ringing. by now
women were holding their stomachs, and the men were
slapping their knees. it was mrs. jackson, who ate ice, who
tripped down off her porch and marched--actually marchedalong
behind him. the scene was so comic the people
walked into the road to make sure they saw it all. in that way
the parade started. everybody, dessie, tar baby, patsy,
mr. buckland reed, teapot's mamma, valentine, the
deweys, mrs. jackson, irene, the proprietor of the palace of
cosmetology, reba, the herrod brothers and flocks of
teen-agers got into the mood and, laughing, dancing,
calling to one another, formed a pied piper's band behind
shadrack. as the initial group of about twenty people
passed more houses, they called to the people standing in
doors and leaning out of windows to join them; to help them
open further this slit in the veil, this respite from anxiety,
from dignity, f

relief that broke in the
chest of practically everybody when sula died did not
soften their spite and allow them to go to mr. hodges'
funeral parlor or send flowers from the church or bake a
yellow cake. she thought about nathan opening the
bedroom door the day she had visited her, and finding the
body. he said he knew she was dead right away not
because her eyes were open but because her mouth was. it
looked to him like a giant yawn that she never got to finish.
he had run across the street to teapot's mamma, who,
when she heard the news, said, "ho!" like the conductor on
the train when it was about to take off except louder, and
then did a little dance. none of the women left their quilt
patches in disarray to run to the house. nobody left the
clothes halfway through the wringer to run to the house.
even the men just said "uhn," when they heard. the day
passed and no one came. the night slipped into another
day and the body was still lying in eva's bed gazing at the
ceiling trying to compl
