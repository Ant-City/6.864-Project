[CHARACTER] - 
the prophets who oppose the worship of the god baal
in israel. after the division of israel into two kingdoms, elijah
and his successor, elisha, represent the last great spiritual heroes
before israel's exile. their campaign in northern israel against
king ahab and jezebel helps to lessen israel's growing evil but
does not restore israel's greatness. israel's demise makes elijah and
elisha frustrated doomsayers and miracle workers rather than national
leaders or saviors.
