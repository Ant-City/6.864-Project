 electrons.
according to string theory, all such particles are actually tiny loops of vibrating string.

string theory as the unified theory of everything

in  einstein's  day,  the  strong  and  the  weak  forces  had  not  yet  been  discovered,  but  he  found  the
existence of even two distinct forces—gravity and electromagnetism—deeply troubling. einstein did
not accept that nature is founded on such an extravagant design. this launched his thirty-year voyage
in search of the so-called unified field theory that he hoped would show that these two forces are
really manifestations of one grand underlying principle. this quixotic quest isolated einstein from the
mainstream  of  physics,  which,  understandably,  was  far  more  excited  about  delving  into  the  newly
emerging framework of quantum mechanics. he wrote to a friend in the early 1940s, "i have become a
lonely  old  chap  who  is  mainly  known  because  he  doesn't  wear  socks  and  who  is  exhibited  as  a
curiosity on special occasi

the institute for advanced study. founded in 1930, it is set within gently rolling fields on the border
of an idyllic forest a few miles from the campus of princeton university. it is said that you can't get
distracted from your work at the institute, because, well, there aren't any distractions.

after leaving germany in 1933, einstein joined the institute and remained there for the duration
of his life. it takes little imagination to picture him pondering unified field theory in the institute's
quiet, lonely, almost ascetic surroundings. the legacy of deep thought infuses the atmosphere, which,
depending on your own immediate state of progress, can be either exciting or oppressive.

shortly after arriving at the institute, aspinwall and i were walking down nassau street (the
main commercial street in the town of princeton) trying to agree on a place to have dinner. this was
no small task since paul is as devout a meat eater as i am a vegetarian. in the midst of catc
