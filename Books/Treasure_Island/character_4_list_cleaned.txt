dr.[CHARACTER] - 
                 the
local doctor. dr.[CHARACTER] is wise and practical, and jim respects
but is not inspired by him.[CHARACTER] exhibits common sense and rational
thought while on the island, and his idea to send ben to spook the
pirates reveals a deep understanding of human nature. he is fair-minded,
magnanimously agreeing to treat the pirates with just as much care
as his own wounded men. as his name suggests,[CHARACTER] represents
the steady, modest virtues of everyday life rather than fantasy,
dream, or adventure.
