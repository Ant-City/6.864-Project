and all that rot.”

amory smiled and tried to picture himself as “good old amory.” he failed
completely.

february dripped snow and rain, the cyclonic freshman mid-years passed,
and life in 12 univee continued interesting if not purposeful. once a
day amory indulged in a club sandwich, cornflakes, and julienne potatoes
at “joe’s,” accompanied usually by kerry or alec connage. the latter was
a quiet, rather aloof slicker from hotchkiss, who lived next door and
shared the same enforced singleness as amory, due to the fact that
his entire class had gone to yale. “joe’s” was unaesthetic and faintly
unsanitary, but a limitless charge account could be opened there, a
convenience that amory appreciated. his father had been experimenting
with mining stocks and, in consequence, his allowance, while liberal,
was not at all what he had expected.

“joe’s” had the a

but the liturgy of livingstone collars and dark ties fell on heedless
ears; in fact d’invilliers faintly resented his efforts; so amory
confined himself to calls once a week, and brought him occasionally to
12 univee. this caused mild titters among the other freshmen, who called
them “doctor johnson and boswell.”

alec connage, another frequent visitor, liked him in a vague way, but
was afraid of him as a highbrow. kerry, who saw through his poetic
patter to the solid, almost respectable depths within, was immensely
amused and would have him recite poetry by the hour, while he lay with
closed eyes on amory’s sofa and listened:

   “asleep or waking is it? for her neck
    kissed over close, wears yet a purple speck
    wherein the pained blood falters and goes out;
    soft and stung softly--fairer for a fleck...

club in which he was not interested, took great pleasure in shocking
them with unorthodox remarks.

“oh, let me see--” he said one night to a flabbergasted delegation,
“what club do you represent?”

with visitors from ivy and cottage and tiger inn he played the “nice,
unspoilt, ingenuous boy” very much at ease and quite unaware of the
object of the call.

when the fatal morning arrived, early in march, and the campus became
a document in hysteria, he slid smoothly into cottage with alec connage
and watched his suddenly neurotic class with much wonder.

there were fickle groups that jumped from club to club; there were
friends of two or three days who announced tearfully and wildly that
they must join the same club, nothing should separate them; there were
snarling disclosures of long-hidden grudges as the suddenly prominent
remembered snubs of freshman year. unknown men were elevated into
importance when they received certain coveted bids; others who were
considered “all set” foun

 a good crowd.”

when the bar closed, the party broke up into groups and streamed,
singing, over the snow-clad campus, in a weird delusion that
snobbishness and strain were over at last, and that they could do what
they pleased for the next two years.

long afterward amory thought of sophomore spring as the happiest time of
his life. his ideas were in tune with life as he found it; he wanted
no more than to drift and dream and enjoy a dozen new-found friendships
through the april afternoons.

alec connage came into his room one morning and woke him up into the
sunshine and peculiar glory of campbell hall shining in the window.

“wake up, original sin, and scrape yourself together. be in front of
renwick’s in half an hour. somebody’s got a car.” he took the bureau
cover and carefully deposited it, with its load of small articles, upon
the bed.

“where’d you get the car?” demanded amory cynically.

“sacred trust, but don’t be a critical goopher or you can’t go!”
