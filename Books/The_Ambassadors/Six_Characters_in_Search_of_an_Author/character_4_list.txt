The Manager  - 
      Somewhat slow-witted and of fiery temper. The Manager is largely a comic figure who agrees to play the role of the Characters' author and realizing their drama. Throughout the play, he remains committed to the vulgar notions of reality that the Characters, particularly his double the Father, would trouble and bound to the conventions of the stagecraft.
