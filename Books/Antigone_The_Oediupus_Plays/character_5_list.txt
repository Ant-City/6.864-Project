Tiresias - 
                	Tiresias,
the blind soothsayer of Thebes, appears in both Oedipus
the King and Antigone. In Oedipus
the King, Tiresias tells Oedipus that he is the murderer
he hunts, and Oedipus does not believe him. In Antigone, Tiresias
tells Creon that Creon himself is bringing disaster upon Thebes,
and Creon does not believe him. Yet, both Oedipus and Creon claim
to trust Tiresias deeply. The literal blindness of the soothsayer
points to the metaphorical blindness of those who refuse to believe
the truth about themselves when they hear it spoken.
