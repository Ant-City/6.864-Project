does a card-trick. he was a man who adapted fast.
i got him his rock-hammer. i had it in my cell for one night, and it was just as he described
it. it was no tool for escape (it would have taken a man just about six hundred years to
tunnel under the wall using that rock-hammer, i figured), but i still felt some misgivings. if
you planted that pickaxe end in a man's head, he would surely never
listen to fibber mcgee and molly on the radio again. and andy had already begun having
trouble with the sisters. i hoped it wasn't them he was wanting the rockhammer
for.

in the end, i trusted my judgment. early the next morning, twenty minutes before
the wake-up horn went off, i slipped the rock-hammer and a package of camels to
ernie, the old trusty who swept the cellblock 5 corridors until he was let free
in 1956. he slipped it into his tunic without a word, and i didn't see the
rock hammer again for nineteen years, and by then it was damned near worn away to
nothing.

ked over to me in the exercise yard again. he was
nothing to look at that day, i can tell you. his lower lip was swelled up so big
it looked like a summer sausage, his right eye was swollen half-shut, and there
was an ugly washboard scrape across one cheek. he was having his troubles with
the sisters, all right, but he never mentioned them. "thanks for the tool," he
said, and walked away.
i watched him curiously. he walked a few steps, saw something in the dirt, bent
over, and picked it up. it was a small rock. prison fatigues, except for those
worn by mechanics when they're on the job, have no pockets. but there are ways
to get around that. the little pebble disappeared up andy's sleeve and didn't
come down. i admired that . . . and i admired him. in spite of the problems he
was having, he

 was going on with his life. there are thousands who don't or
won't or can't, and plenty of them aren't in prison, either. and i noticed that,
although his face looked as if a twister had happened to it, his hands were
still neat and clean, the nails well-kept.

i didn't see much of him over the next six months; andy spent a lot of that time
in solitary.

a few words about the sisters.
in a lot of pens they are known as bull queers or jailhouse susies-just lately
the term in fashion is "killer queens." but in shawshank they were always the
sisters. i don't know why, but other than the name i guess there was no
difference.
it comes as no surprise to most these days that there's a lot of buggery going
on inside the walls-except to some of the new fish, maybe, who have the
misfortune to be young, slim, good-looking, and unwary-but homosexuality, like
straight sex, comes in a hu

going crazy. usually what follows is an arrangement between two fundamentally
heterosexual men, although i've sometimes wondered if they are quite as
heterosexual as they thought they were going to be when they get back to their
wives or their girlfriends.
there are also men who get "turned" in prison. in the current parlance they "go
gay," or "come out of the closet. " mostly (but not always) they play the
female, and their favors are competed for fiercely.
and then there are the sisters.
they are to prison society what the rapist is to the society outside the walls.
they're usually long-timers, doing hard bullets for brutal crimes. their prey is
the young, the weak, and the inexperienced . . . or, as in the case of andy
dufresne, the weak-looking. their hunting grounds are the showers, the cramped,
tunnel-like areaway behind the industrial washers in the laundry, sometimes the
infirmary. on more than one occasion rape has occurred in the closet-sized

e auditorium. most often what the sisters take by
force they could have had for free, if they wanted it that way; those who have
been turned always seem to have "crushes" on one sister or another, like teenage
girls with their sinatras, presleys, or redfords. but for the sisters, the joy
has always been in taking it by force . . . and i guess it always will be.
because of his small size and fair good looks (and maybe also because of that
very quality of self-possession i had admired), the sisters were after andy from
the day he walked in. if this was some kind of fairy story, i'd tell you that
andy fought the good fight until they left him alone. i wish i could say that,
but i can't. prison is no fairy-tale world.
the first time for him was in the shower less than three days after he joined
our happy shawshank family. just a lot of slap and tickle that time, i
understand. they like to size you up before they make their real move, like

ere that day, but henley backus, who had been washroom foreman
down there since 1922, told me that four of his friends were. andy held them at
bay for awhile with a scoop of burning hexlite, threatening to throw it in their eyes if
they came any closer, but he tripped trying to back around one of the big washex
fourpockets. that was all it took. they were on him.
i guess the phrase gang-rape is one that doesn't change much from one generation
to the next. that's what they did to him, those four sisters. they bent him over
a gear-box and one of them held a phillips screwdriver to his temple while they
gave him the business. it rips you up some, but not bad-am i speaking from
personal experience, you ask?-i only wish i weren't. you bleed for awhile. if
you don't want some clown asking you if you just started your period, you wad up
a bunch of toilet paper and keep it down the back of your underwear until it
stops. the bleeding really is like a menstrual flow; it keeps up for two, maybe

ys, a slow trickle. then it stops. no harm done, unless they've done
something even more unnatural to you. no physical harm done but rape is rape,
and eventually you have to look at your face in the mirror again and decide what
to make of yourself.
andy went through that alone, the way he went through everything alone in those
days. he must have come to the conclusion that others before him had come to,
namely, that then are only two ways to deal with the sisters: fight them and get
taken or just get taken.
he decided to fight. when bogs and two of his buddies cam after him a week or so
after the laundry incident ("i heard ya go broke in," bogs said, according to
ernie, who was around at the time), andy slugged it out with them. he broke the
nose of fellow named rooster macbride, a heavy-gutted farmer who was is for
beating his stepdaughter to death. rooster died in here, i'm happy to add.
they took him, all three of them. when it was done, rooster and

roken ribs, the hemorrhaged eye,
the sprained back, and the dislocated hip-bogs diamond left andy alone. in fact,
after that he left everyone pretty much alone. he got to be like a high wind in
the summertime, all bluster and no bite. you could say, in fact, that he turned
into a "weak sister."
that was the end of bogs diamond, a man who might eventually have killed andy if
andy hadn't taken steps to prevent it (if it was him who took the steps). but it
wasn't the end of andy's trouble with the sisters. there was a little hiatus,
and then it began again, although not so hard or so often. jackals like easy
prey, and there were easier pickings around than andy dufresne.
he always fought them, that's what i remember. he knew, i guess, that if you let
them have at you even once without fighting, it got that much easier to let them
have their way without fighting next time. so andy would turn up with bruises on
his face every once in awhile, and there was the matter of the two broken
fingers six o

r eight months after diamond's beating. oh yes-and sometime in late
1949, the man landed in the infirmary with a broken cheekbone that was probably
the result of someone swinging a nice chunk of pipe with the business-end
wrapped in flannel. he always fought back, and as a result, he did his time in
solitary. but i don't think solitary was the hardship for andy that it was for
some men. he got along with himself.
the sisters was something he adjusted himself to-and then, in 1950, it stopped
almost completely. that is a part of my story that i'll get to in due time.

in the fall of 1948, andy met me one morning in the exercise yard and asked me
if i could get him half a dozen rock-blankets.
"what the hell are those?" i asked.
he told me that was just what rockhounds called them; they were polishing cloths
about the size of dishtowels. they were heavily padded, with a smooth side and a
rough side-the smooth sid

all her swimsuited glory, one hand behind her
head, her eyes half-closed, those soft, satiny lips parted. it was over his bunk
where he could look at her nights, after lights-out, in the glow of the arc
sodium lights in the exercise yard.
but in the bright morning sunlight, there were dark slashes across her face-the
shadow of the bars on his single slit window.

now i'm going to tell you what happened in mid-may of 1950 that finally ended
andy's three-year series of skirmishes with the sisters. it was also the
incident which eventually got him out of the laundry and into the library, where
he filled out his work-time until he left our happy little family earlier this
year.
you may have noticed how much of what i've told you already is hearsay-someone
saw something and told me and i told you. well, in some cases i've simplified it
even more than it really was, and have repeated (or will repeat) fourth- or
fifth-hand information. that's the way it is here. the grapevine is very real,

grains of truth from the chaff of lies, rumors, and
wish-it-had-beens.
you may also have gotten the idea that i'm describing someone who's more legend
than man, and i would have to agree that there's some truth to that. to us
long-timers who knew andy over a space of years, there was an element of fantasy
to him, a sense, almost, of myth-magic, if you get what i mean. that story i
passed on about andy refusing to give bogs diamond a head-job is part of that
myth, and how he kept on fighting the sisters is part of it, and how he got the
library job is part of it, too . . . but with one important difference: i was
there and i saw what happened, and i swear on my mother's name that it's all
true. the oath of a convicted murderer may not be worth much, but believe this:
i don't lie.
andy and i were on fair speaking terms by then. the guy fascinated me. looking
back to the poster episode, i see there's one thing i neglected to tell you, and
maybe i should. five weeks after he hung rita up (i'd for

n something else as well. a sense of his own worth,
maybe, or a feeling that he would be the winner in the end . . . or maybe it was
only a sense of freedom, even inside these goddamned gray walls. it was a kind
of inner light he carried around with him. i only knew him to lose that light
once, and that is also a part of this story.

by world series time of 1950-this was the year the philadelphia whiz kids
dropped four straight, you will remember-andy was having no more trouble from
the sisters. stammas and hadley had passed the word. if andy dufresne came to
either of them, or any of the other screws that formed a part of their coterie,
and showed so much as a single drop of blood in his underpants, every sister in
shawshank would go to bed that night with a headache. they didn't fight it. as i
have pointed out, there was always an eighteen-year old car thief or a firebug
or some guy who'd gotten his kicks handling little children. after the day on

way and the sisters went theirs.
he was working in the library then, under a tough old con named brooks hatlen.
hatlen had gotten the job back in the late twenties because he had a college
education. brooksie's degree was in animal husbandry, true enough, but college
educations in institutes of lower learning like the shank are so rare that it's
a case of beggars not being able to be choosers.

down the most was getting rid of the wall as he took it out. he could muffle the
sound of his work by wrapping the head of his hammer in rock-polishing cloths,
but what to do with the pulverized concrete and the occasional chunks that came
out whole?
i think he must have broken up the chunks into pebbles and . . .
i remembered the sunday after i had gotten him the rockhammer. i remember
watching him walk across the exercise yard, his face puffy from his latest
go-round with the sisters. i saw him stoop, pick up a pebble . . . and it
disappeared up his sleeve. that inside sleeve-pocket is an old prison trick. up
your sleeve or just inside the cuff of your pants. and i have another memory,
very strong but unfocused, maybe something i saw more than once. this memory is
of andy dufresne walking across the exercise yard on a hot summer day when the
air was utterly still. still, yeah . . . except for the little breeze that
seemed to be blowing sand around andy dufresne's feet. so m

es, which in those days were sometimes little it
better than legal loan sharks. when he d finished, the screwhead started to put
out his hand . . . and then drew it back to himself quickly. he d forgotten for
a moment, you see, that he was dealing with a mascot, not a man.
andy kept up on the tax laws and the changes in the stock markets and so his
usefulness didn't end after he d been in cold storage for awhile, as it might
have done. he began to get his library money, his running war with the sisters
had ended, and nobody tossed his cell very hard. he was a good nigger.
then one day, very late in the going-perhaps around october of 1967-the
long-time hobby suddenly turned into something else. one night while was in the
hole up to his waist with raquel welch hanging down over his ass, the pick end of
his rock-hammer must have suddenly sunk into concrete past the hilt.
he would have dragged some chunks of concrete back, but maybe he heard other
