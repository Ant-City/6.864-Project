 quarter. twenty years earlier the means of resistance must have been far fewer, and the enemy in command of almost all the lines of access between the beleaguered villages; and, considering these things, i felt the sinister force of harmon’s phrase: “most of the smart ones get away.” but if that were the case, how could any combination of obstacles have hindered the flight of a man like ethan frome?
during my stay at starkfield i lodged with a middle-aged widow colloquially known as mrs. ned hale. mrs. hale’s father had been the village lawyer of the previous generation, and “lawyer varnum’s house,” where my landlady still lived with her mother, was the most considerable mansion in the village. it stood at one end of the main street, its classic portico and small-paned windows looking down a flagged path between norway spruces to the slim white steeple of the congregational church. it was clear that the varnum fortunes were at the ebb, but the two women did what they could to pr

eserve a decent dignity; and mrs. hale, in particular, had a certain wan refinement not out of keeping with her pale old-fashioned house.
in the “best parlour,” with its black horse-hair and mahogany weakly illuminated by a gurgling carcel lamp, i listened every evening to another and more delicately shaded version of the starkfield chronicle. it was not that mrs. ned hale felt, or affected, any social superiority to the people about her; it was only that the accident of a finer sensibility and a little more education had put just enough distance between herself and her neighbours to enable her to judge them with detachment. she was not unwilling to exercise this faculty, and i had great hopes of getting from her the missing facts of ethan frome’s story, or rather such a key to his character as should co-ordinate the facts i knew. her mind was a store-house of

so marked was the change in her manner, such depths of sad initiation did it imply, that, with some doubts as to my delicacy, i put the case anew to my village oracle, harmon gow; but got for my pains only an uncomprehending grunt.
“ruth varnum was always as nervous as a rat; and, come to think of it, she was the first one to see ‘em after they was picked up. it happened right below lawyer varnum’s, down at the bend of the corbury road, just round about the time that ruth got engaged to ned hale. the young folks was all friends, and i guess she just can’t bear to talk about it. she’s had troubles enough of her own.”
all the dwellers in starkfield, as in more notable communities, had had troubles enough of their own to make them comparatively indifferent to those of their neighbours; and though all conceded that ethan frome’s had been beyond the common measure, no one gave me an explanation of the look in his face which, as i persisted in thinking, neither poverty nor physical s

the blackness. she moved forward a step or two and then paused again above the dip of the corbury road. its icy slope, scored by innumerable runners, looked like a mirror scratched by travellers at an inn.
“there was a whole lot of them coasting before the moon set,” she said.
“would you like to come in and coast with them some night?” he asked.
“oh, would you, ethan? it would be lovely!”
“we’ll come to-morrow if there’s a moon.”
she lingered, pressing closer to his side. “ned hale and ruth varnum came just as near running into the big elm at the bottom. we were all sure they were killed.” her shiver ran down his arm. “wouldn’t it have been too awful? they’re so happy!”
“oh, ned ain’t much at steering. i guess i can take you down all right!” he said disdainfully.
he was aware that he was “talking big,” like denis eady; but his reaction of joy had unsteadied him, and the inflection with which she had said of the engaged couple “they’re so happy!”

s, where he had stood with her the night before. as he passed into their gloom he saw an indistinct outline just ahead of him. at his approach it melted for an instant into two separate shapes and then conjoined again, and he heard a kiss, and a half-laughing “oh!” provoked by the discovery of his presence. again the outline hastily disunited and the varnum gate slammed on one half while the other hurried on ahead of him. ethan smiled at the discomfiture he had caused. what did it matter to ned hale and ruth varnum if they were caught kissing each other? everybody in starkfield knew they were engaged. it pleased ethan to have surprised a pair of lovers on the spot where he and mattie had stood with such a thirst for each other in their hearts; but he felt a pang at the thought that these two need not hide their happiness.
he fetched the grays from hale’s stable and started on his long climb back to the farm. the cold was less sharp than earlier in the day and a thick fleecy sky threatene

eep silence had fallen with the starless dusk, and they leaned on each other without speaking; but at every step of their climb ethan said to himself: “it’s the last time we’ll ever walk together.”
they mounted slowly to the top of the hill. when they were abreast of the church he stooped his head to her to ask: “are you tired?” and she answered, breathing quickly: “it was splendid!”
with a pressure of his arm he guided her toward the norway spruces. “i guess this sled must be ned hale’s. anyhow i’ll leave it where i found it.” he drew the sled up to the varnum gate and rested it against the fence. as he raised himself he suddenly felt mattie close to him among the shadows.
“is this where ned and ruth kissed each other?” she whispered breathlessly, and flung her arms about him. her lips, groping for his, swept over his face, and he held her fast in a rapture of surprise.
“good-bye-good-bye,” she stammered, and kissed him again.
“oh, matt, i can’t let you go!
