alarum.

enter plantagenet, edward, richard, norfolke, mountague,
warwicke, and
souldiers.

  warwicke. i wonder how the king escap'd our hands?
  pl. while we pursu'd the horsmen of y north,
he slyly stole away, and left his men:
whereat the great lord of northumberland,
whose warlike eares could neuer brooke retreat,
chear'd vp the drouping army, and himselfe.
lord clifford and lord stafford all a-brest
charg'd our maine battailes front: and breaking in,
were by the swords of common souldiers slaine

before i see thee seated in that throne,
which now the house of lancaster vsurpes,
i vow by heauen, these eyes shall neuer close.
this is the pallace of the fearefull king,
and this the regall seat: possesse it yorke,
for this is thine, and not king henries heires

   plant. assist me then, sweet warwick, and i will,
for hither we haue broken in by force

vnlesse he seeke to thrust you out perforce

   henry. art thou against vs, duke of exeter?
  exet. his is the right, and therefore pardon me

   plant. why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
  exet. my conscience tells me he is lawfull king

   henry. all will reuolt from me, and turne to him

thinke not, that henry shall be so depos'd

   warw. depos'd he shall be, in despight of all

   northumb. thou art deceiu'd:
'tis not thy southerne power
of essex, norfolke, suffolke, nor of kent,
which makes thee thus presumptuous and prowd,
can set the duke vp in despight of me

   clifford. king henry, be thy title right or wrong,
lord clifford vowes to fight in thy defence:
may that ground gape, and swallow me aliue,
where i shall kneele to him that slew my father

 is vaine and friuolous.
therefore to armes: and father doe but thinke,
how sweet a thing it is to weare a crowne,
within whose circuit is elizium,
and all that poets faine of blisse and ioy.
why doe we linger thus? i cannot rest,
vntill the white rose that i weare, be dy'de

   yorke. richard ynough: i will be king, or dye.
brother, thou shalt to london presently,
and whet on warwick to this enterprise.
thou richard shalt to the duke of norfolke,
and tell him priuily of our intent.
you edward shall vnto my lord cobham,
with whom the kentishmen will willingly rise.
in them i trust: for they are souldiors,
wittie, courteous, liberall, full of spirit.
while you are thus imploy'd, what resteth more?
but that i seeke occasion how to rise,
and yet the king not priuie to my drift,
nor any of the house of lancaster.

 death,
i cannot iudge: but to conclude with truth,
their weapons like to lightning, came and went:
our souldiers like the night-owles lazie flight,
or like a lazie thresher with a flaile,
fell gently downe, as if they strucke their friends.
i cheer'd them vp with iustice of our cause,
with promise of high pay, and great rewards:
but all in vaine, they had no heart to fight,
and we (in them) no hope to win the day,
so that we fled: the king vnto the queene,
lord george, your brother, norfolke, and my selfe,
in haste, post haste, are come to ioyne with you:
for in the marches heere we heard you were,
making another head, to fight againe

   ed. where is the duke of norfolke, gentle warwick?
and when came george from burgundy to england?
  war. some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers,
and for your brother he was lately sent
from your kinde aunt dutchesse of burgundie,
with ayde of souldiers to this needfull warre

   rich. 'twas oddes belike, when valiant warwick

erefore comes my brother mountague:
attend me lords, the proud insulting queene,
with clifford, and the haught northumberland,
and of their feather, many moe proud birds,
haue wrought the easie-melting king, like wax.
he swore consent to your succession,
his oath enrolled in the parliament.
and now to london all the crew are gone,
to frustrate both his oath, and what beside
may make against the house of lancaster.
their power (i thinke) is thirty thousand strong:
now, if the helpe of norfolke, and my selfe,
with all the friends that thou braue earle of march,
among'st the louing welshmen can'st procure,
will but amount to fiue and twenty thousand,
why via, to london will we march,
and once againe, bestride our foaming steeds,
and once againe cry charge vpon our foes,
but neuer once againe turne backe and flye

   rich. i, now me thinks i heare great warwick speak;
ne're may he liue to see a sun-shine day,
that cries retire, if warwicke bid him stay
