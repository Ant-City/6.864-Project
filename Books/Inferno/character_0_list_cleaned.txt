[CHARACTER] - 
                the
author and protagonist of inferno; the focus of
all action and interaction with other characters. because [CHARACTER]
chose to present his fictional poem as a record of events that actually
happened to him, a wide gulf between [CHARACTER] the poet and [CHARACTER] the
character pervades the poem. for instance, [CHARACTER] the poet often portrays
[CHARACTER] the character as compassionate and sympathetic at the sight
of suffering sinners, but [CHARACTER] the poet chose to place them in
hell and devised their suffering. as a result, if [CHARACTER] the character
is at all representative of [CHARACTER] the poet, he is a very simplified version:
sympathetic, somewhat fearful of danger, and confused both morally
and intellectually by his experience in hell. as the poem progresses,
[CHARACTER] the character gradually learns to abandon his sympathy and
adopt a more pitiless attitude toward the punishment of sinners,
which he views as merely a reflection of divine justice.
