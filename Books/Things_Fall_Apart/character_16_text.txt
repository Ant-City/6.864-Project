glasses on his eyes so that he could see and talk to evil spirits. not
long after, he won his first three converts.

although nwoye had been attracted to the new faith from the very
first day, he kept it secret. he dared not go too near the
missionaries for fear of his father. but whenever they came to
preach in the open marketplace or the village play

ground, nwoye was there. and he was already beginning to know
some of the simple stories they told.




"we have now built a church," said mr. kiaga, the interpreter, who
was now in charge of the infant congregation. the white man had
gone back to umuofia, where he built his headquarters and from
where he paid regular visits to mr. kiaga's congregation at mbanta.

"we have now built a church," said mr. kiaga, "and we want you
all to come in every seventh day to worship the true god."

on the following sunday, nwoye passed and repassed the little
red-earth and thatch building without summoning enough courage
to enter. he heard the voice of s

that limit no man was suffered to go. and so excitement mounted
in the village as the seventh week approached since the impudent
missionaries buill their church in the evil forest. the villagers
were so certain about the doom that awaited these men that one or
two converts thought it wise to suspend their allegiance to the new
faith.

at last the day came by which all the missionaries should have
died. but they were still alive, building a new red-earth and thatch
house for their teacher, mr. kiaga. that week they won a handful
more converts. and for the first time they had a woman. her name
was nneka, the wife of amadi, who was a prosperous farmer. she
was very heavy with child.

nneka had had four previous pregnancies and child-births. but
each time she had borne twins, and they had been immediately



thrown away. her husband and his family were already becoming
highly critical of such a woman and were not unduly perturbed
when they found she had fled to join the christians. it was a

red okonkwo, "before i kill you!" he seized a
heavy stick that lay on the dwarf wall and hit him two or three
savage blows.

"answer me!" he roared again. nwoye stood looking at him and
did not say a word. the women were screaming outside, afraid to
go in.

"leave that boy at once!" said a voice in the outer compound. it
was okonkwo's uncle, uchendu. "are you mad?"

okonkwo did not answer. but he left hold of nwoye, who walked
away and never returned.




he went back to the church and told mr. kiaga that he had decided
to go to umuofia where the white missionary had set up a school
to teach young christians to read and write.

mr. kiaga's joy was very great. "blessed is he who forsakes his
father and his mother for my sake," he intoned. "those that hear
my words are my father and my mother."

nwoye did not fully understand. but he was happy to leave his
father. he would return later to his mother and his brothers and
sisters and convert them to the new faith.

re already gaining ground that the white man had not
only brought a religion but also a government. it was said that they
had built a place of judgment in umuofia to protect the followers
of their religion. it was even said that they had hanged one man
who killed a missionary.

although such stories were now often told they looked like fairy-
tales in mbanta and did not as yet affect the relationship between
the new church and the clan. there was no question of killing a
missionary here, for mr. kiaga, despite his madness, was quite
harmless. as for his converts, no one could kill them without
having to flee from the clan, for in spite of their worthlessness they
still belonged to the clan. and so nobody gave serious thought to
the stories about the white man's government or the consequences
of killing the christians. if they became more troublesome than
they already were they would simply be driven out of the clan.

 was possible that they
would also be received. and so one sunday two of them went into
the church. there was an immediate stir, but so great was the work
the new religion had done among the converts that they did not
immediately leave the church when the outcasts came in. those
who found themselves nearest to them merely moved to another
seat. it was a miracle. but it only lasted till the end of the service.



the whole church raised a protest and was about to drive these
people out, when mr. kiaga stopped them and began to explain.



"before god," he said, "there is no slave or free. we are all
children of god and we must receive these our brothers."

"you do not understand," said one of the converts. "what will the
heathen say of us when they hear that we receive osu into our
midst? they will laugh."

"let them laugh," said mr. kiaga. "god will laugh at them on the
judgment day. why do the nations rage and the peoples imagine a
vain thing? he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh. th

pecial area of the village, close to the great shrine. wherever he
went he carried with him the mark of his forbidden casteâ€”long,
tangled and dirty hair. a razor was taboo to him. an osu could not
attend an assembly of the free-born, and they, in turn, could not
shelter under his roof. he could not take any of the four titles of
the clan, and when he died he was buried by his kind in the evil
forest. how could such a man be a follower of christ?

"he needs christ more than you and i," said mr. kiaga.

"then i shall go back to the clan," said the convert. and he went.
mr. kiaga stood firm, and it was his firmness that saved the young
church. the wavering converts drew inspiration and confidence



from his unshakable faith. he ordered the outcasts to shave off
their long, tangled hair. at first they were afraid they might die.



"unless you shave off the mark of your heathen belief i will not
admit you into the church," said mr. kiaga. "you fear that you will
die. why should that be? how

the christians had grown in number and were now a small
community of men, women and children, self-assured and
confident. mr. brown, the white missionary, paid regular visits to
them. "when i think that it is only eighteen months since the seed
was first sown among you," he said, "i marvel at what the lord
hath wrought."

it was wednesday in holy week and mr. kiaga had asked the
women to bring red earth and white chalk and water to scrub the
church for easter, and the women had formed themselves into
three groups for this purpose. they set out early that morning,
some of them with their water-pots to the stream, another group
with hoes and baskets to the village earth pit, and the others to the
chalk quarry.

mr. kiaga was praying in the church when he heard the women
talking excitedly. he rounded off his prayer and went to see what it
was all about. the

women had come to the church with empty
waterpots. they said that some young men had chased them away
from the stream with whips. soon after, the women who had gone
for red earth returned with empty baskets. some of them had been
heavily whipped. the chalk women also returned to tell a similar
story.

"what does it all mean?" asked mr. kiaga, who was greatly
perplexed.

"the village has outlawed us," said one of the women. "the bell-
man announced it last night. but it is not our custom to debar
anyone from the stream or the quarry."



another woman said, "they want to ruin us. they will not allow
us into the markets. they have said so."



mr. kiaga was going to send into the village for his men-converts
when he saw them coming on their own. of course they had all
heard the bell-man, but they had never in all their lives heard o

women being debarred from the stream.

"come along," they said to the women. "we will go with you to
meet those cowards." some of them had big sticks and some even
machetes.

but mr. kiaga restrained them. he wanted first to know why they
had been outlawed.

"they say that okoli killed the sacred python," said one man.

"it is false," said another. "okoli told me himself that it was false."

okoli was not there to answer. he had fallen ill on the previous
night. before the day was over he was dead. his death showed that
the gods were still able to fight their own battles. the clan saw no
reason then for molesting the christians.
