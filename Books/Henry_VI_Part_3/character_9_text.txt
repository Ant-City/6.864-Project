  king. once more we sit in englands royall throne,
re-purchac'd with the blood of enemies:
what valiant foe-men, like to autumnes corne,
haue we mow'd downe in tops of all their pride?
three dukes of somerset, threefold renowne,
for hardy and vndoubted champions:
two cliffords, as the father and the sonne,
and two northumberlands: two brauer men,
ne're spurr'd their coursers at the trumpets sound.
with them, the two braue beares, warwick & montague,
that in their chaines fetter'd the kingly lyon,
and made the forrest tremble when they roar'd.
thus haue we swept suspition from our seate,
and made our footstoole of security.
