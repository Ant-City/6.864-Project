[CHARACTER] - 
                babette's
six-year-old son, and the youngest child in the family. [CHARACTER] never
speaks in the novel, and periodically jack worries about the boy's
slow linguistic development. nevertheless, in his wordlessness,
he remains an essential source of comfort for both jack and babette.
more than any of the other children, [CHARACTER] seems genuinely open
to the kind of "psychic data" murray believes american children
are privy to. [CHARACTER] has an older full brother, eugene, though their
father remains unnamed in the novel.
