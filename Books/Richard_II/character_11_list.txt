Thomas Percy, Earl of Worcester  - 
      
        Called "Worcester." He does not appear in the play, but is a powerful figure to whom other characters frequently refer. The Lord Steward of the king's household, he is also the brother of Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, and thus the uncle of young Harry Percy. When Northumberland is declared a traitor for having joined Bolingbroke's army, Worcester also resigns his stewardship and defects to Bolingbroke, taking the servants of the king's house with him.
