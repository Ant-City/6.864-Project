and cool even in the hottest
noons, mysterious, a little sinister, the soughing pines seeming
to wait with an age-old patience, to threaten with soft sighs:
"be careful!  be careful!  we had you once.  we can take you back
again."

to the ears of the three on the porch came the sounds of hooves,
the jingling of harness chains and the shrill careless laughter
of negro voices, as the field hands and mules came in from the
fields.  from within the house floated the soft voice of
scarlett's mother, ellen o'hara, as she called to the little black
girl who carried her basket of keys.  the high-pitched, childish
voice answered "yas'm," and there were sounds of footsteps going
out the back way toward the smokehouse where ellen would ration
out the food to the home-coming hands.  there was the click of
china and the rattle of silver as pork, the valet-butler of tara,
laid the table for supper.

at these last sounds, the twins realized it was time they were
starting home.  but they were loath to face their

mammy emerged from the hall, a huge old woman with the small,
shrewd eyes of an elephant.  she was shining black, pure african,
devoted to her last drop of blood to the o'haras, ellen's
mainstay, the despair of her three daughters, the terror of the
other house servants.  mammy was black, but her code of conduct
and her sense of pride were as high as or higher than those of her
owners.  she had been raised in the bedroom of solange robillard,
ellen o'hara's mother, a dainty, cold, high-nosed french-woman,
who spared neither her children nor her servants their just
punishment for any infringement of decorum.  she had been ellen's
mammy and had come with her from savannah to the up-country when
she married.  whom mammy loved, she chastened.  and, as her love
for scarlett and her pride in her were enormous, the chastening
process was practically continuous.

i'll not be worrying your mother with this--nor do you do it
either.  blow your nose, daughter."

scarlett blew her nose on her torn handkerchief, and they started
up the dark drive arm in arm, the horse following slowly.  near
the house, scarlett was at the point of speaking again when she
saw her mother in the dim shadows of the porch.  she had on her
bonnet, shawl and mittens, and behind her was mammy, her face like
a thundercloud, holding in her hand the black leather bag in which
ellen o'hara always carried the bandages and medicines she used in
doctoring the slaves.  mammy's lips were large and pendulous and,
when indignant, she could push out her lower one to twice its
normal length.  it was pushed out now, and scarlett knew that
mammy was seething over something of which she did not approve.

"mr. o'hara," called ellen as she saw the two coming up the
driveway--ellen belonged to a generation that was formal even
after seventeen years of wedlock and the bearing of six children--

te trash dat could ten' to

toward the carriage which was waiting in the side drive.

"take my place at the table, dear," said ellen, patting scarlett's
cheek softly with a mittened hand.

in spite of her choked-back tears, scarlett thrilled to the never-
failing magic of her mother's touch, to the faint fragrance of
lemon verbena sachet that came from her rustling silk dress.  to
scarlett, there was something breath-taking about ellen o'hara, a
miracle that lived in the house with her and awed her and charmed
and soothed her.

gerald helped his wife into the carriage and gave orders to the
coachman to drive carefully.  toby, who had handled gerald's
horses for twenty years, pushed out his lips in mute indignation
at being told how to conduct his own business.  driving off, with
mammy beside him, each was a perfect picture of pouting african
disapproval.

scarlett's heartbreak and his mind was only on plaguing his valet.
scarlett slowly climbed the steps after him, her feet leaden.  she
thought that, after all, a mating between herself and ashley could
be no queerer than that of her father and ellen robillard o'hara.
as always, she wondered how her loud, insensitive father had
managed to marry a woman like her mother, for never were two
people further apart in birth, breeding and habits of mind.



chapter iii


ellen o'hara was thirty-two years old, and, according to the
standards of her day, she was a middle-aged woman, one who had
borne six children and buried three.  she was a tall woman,
standing a head higher than her fiery little husband, but she
moved with such quiet grace in her swaying hoops that the height
attracted no attention to itself.  her neck, rising from the black
taffeta sheath of her basque, was creamy-skinned, rounded and
slender, and it seemed always tilted slightly backward by the
weight of

s-and-so.  it was like a
mathematical formula and no more difficult, for mathematics was
the one subject that had come easy to scarlett in her schooldays.

if she knew little about men's minds, she knew even less about the
minds of women, for they interested her less.  she had never had a
girl friend, and she never felt any lack on that account.  to her,
all women, including her two sisters, were natural enemies in
pursuit of the same prey--man.

all women with the one exception of her mother.

ellen o'hara was different, and scarlett regarded her as something
holy and apart from all the rest of humankind.  when scarlett was
a child, she had confused her mother with the virgin mary, and now
that she was older she saw no reason for changing her opinion.  to
her, ellen represented the utter security that only heaven or a
mother can give.  she knew that her mother was the embodiment of
justice, truth, loving tenderness and profound wisdom--a great
lady.

scarlett wanted very much to be like her mothe

overseer's job in the county.  and all because of a bit of minor
philandering.  he had told gerald over and over that emmie
slattery's baby might have been fathered by any one of a dozen men
as easily as himself--an idea in which gerald concurred--but that
had not altered his case so far as ellen was concerned.  jonas
hated all southerners.  he hated their cool courtesy to him and
their contempt for his social status, so inadequately covered by
their courtesy.  he hated ellen o'hara above anyone else, for she
was the epitome of all that he hated in southerners.

mammy, as head woman of the plantation, had remained to help
ellen, and it was dilcey who rode on the driver's seat beside
toby, the girls' dancing dresses in a long box across her lap.
gerald rode beside the carriage on his big hunter, warm with
brandy and pleased with himself for having gotten through with the
unpleasant business of wilkerson so speedily.  he had shoved the

had to stay in bed for a week.  suellen, sullen and tearful,
pretended to faint too, but came back to consciousness spitting
like an angry cat when scarlett poured a gourdful of water in her
face.  finally she refused point-blank.

"i won't work in the fields like a darky!  you can't make me.  what
if any of our friends ever heard of it?  what if--if mr. kennedy
ever knew?  oh, if mother knew about this--"

"you just mention mother's name once more, suellen o'hara, and i'll
slap you flat," cried scarlett.  "mother worked harder than any
darky on this place and you know it, miss fine airs!"

"she did not!  at least, not in the fields.  and you can't make me.
i'll tell papa on you and he won't make me work!"

"don't you dare go bothering pa with any of our troubles!" cried
scarlett, distracted between indignation at her sister and fear for
gerald.

"i'll help you, sissy," interposed carreen docilely.  "i'll work
for sue and me too.  she isn't well yet and

she knew he knew everything and was hanging on his words.

"well, i don't know right now.  but i'll think of something."

"oh, i know you will!  you are so smart--frank."

she had never called him by his first name before and the sound
came to him as a pleasant shock and surprise.  the poor girl was
probably so upset she didn't even notice her slip.  he felt very
kindly toward her and very protecting.  if there was anything he
could do for suellen o'hara's sister, he would certainly do it.  he
pulled out a red bandanna handkerchief and handed it to her and she
wiped her eyes and began to smile tremulously.

"i'm such a silly little goose," she said apologetically.  "please
forgive me."

"you aren't a silly little goose.  you're a very brave little woman
and you are trying to carry to heavy a load.  i'm afraid miss
pittypat isn't going to be much help to you.  i hear she lost most
of her property and mr. henry hamilton's in bad shape himself.  i

there it was.  she had made her bargain and she intended to stand
by it.  and she was so grateful to frank for saving tara she felt a
warm affection for him and an equally warm determination that he
should never regret marrying her.

the ladies of atlanta knew their neighbors' business only slightly
less completely than they knew their own and were far more
interested in it.  they all knew that for years frank kennedy had
had an "understanding" with suellen o'hara.  in fact, he had said,
sheepishly, that he expected to get married in the spring.  so the
tumult of gossip, surmise and deep suspicion which followed the
announcement of his quiet wedding to scarlett was not surprising.
mrs. merriwether, who never let her curiosity go long unsatisfied
if she could help it, asked him point-blank just what he meant by
marrying one sister when he was betrothed to the other.  she
reported to mrs. elsing that all the answer she got for her pains
was a silly look.

nta, i thought maybe that gives me the right to

the last part of his speech was lost in a faint sibilant buzz that
went through the gathering, an angry beelike buzz.  there were
indignation and disappointment in the sound.  everyone liked will,
everyone respected him for what he had done for tara.  everyone
knew his affections lay with carreen, so the news that he was to
marry the neighborhood pariah instead sat ill upon them.  good old
will marrying that nasty, sneaking little suellen o'hara!

for a moment the air was tense.  mrs. tarleton's eyes began to snap
and her lips to shape soundless words.  in the silence, old man
mcrae's high voice could be heard imploring his grandson to tell
him what had been said.  will faced them all, still mild of face,
but there was something in his pale blue eyes which dared them to
say one word about his future wife.  for a moment the balance hung
between the honest affection everyone had for will and their
contempt for suellen.  and will won.  he
