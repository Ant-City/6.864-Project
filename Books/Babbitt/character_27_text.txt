 came to the office. the
nine were stanley graff, the outside salesman--a youngish man given to
cigarettes and the playing of pool; old mat penniman, general utility
man, collector of rents and salesman of insurance--broken, silent, gray;
a mystery, reputed to have been a "crack" real-estate man with a firm
of his own in haughty brooklyn; chester kirby laylock, resident salesman
out at the glen oriole acreage development--an enthusiastic person with
a silky mustache and much family; miss theresa mcgoun, the swift and
rather pretty stenographer; miss wilberta bannigan, the thick, slow,
laborious accountant and file-clerk; and four freelance part-time
commission salesmen.

as he looked from his own cage into the main room babbitt mourned,
"mcgoun's a good stenog., smart's a whip, but stan graff and all those
bums--" the zest of the spring morning was smothered in the stale office
air.

normally he admired the office, with a pleased surprise that he should
have created this sure lovely thing; no

and loaf all day. and go to gunch's again to-night, and play poker,
and cuss as much as i feel like, and drink a hundred and nine-thousand
bottles of beer."

he sighed; he read through his mail; he shouted "msgoun," which meant
"miss mcgoun"; and began to dictate.

this was his own version of his first letter:

"omar gribble, send it to his office, miss mcgoun, yours of twentieth to
hand and in reply would say look here, gribble, i'm awfully afraid if
we go on shilly-shallying like this we'll just naturally lose the allen

so now let's go to it and get down--no, that's enough--you can tie
those sentences up a little better when you type 'em, miss mcgoun--your

he is perfectly willing to pro rate the special assessment and there
will be no difficulty in getting him to pay for title insurance.

so let's go! yours sincerely,

as he read and signed it, in his correct flowing business-college hand,
babbitt reflected, "now that's a good, strong letter, and clear's a
bell. now what the--i never told mcgoun to make a third paragraph there!
wish she'd quit trying to improve on my dictation! but what i can't
understand is: why can't stan graff or chet laylock write a letter like
that? with punch! with a kick!"

the most important thing he dictated that morning was the fortnightly
form-letter, to be mimeographed and sent out to a thousand "prospects."
it was diligently imitative of the best literary models of the day; of
heart-to-heart-talk advertisements, "sales-pulling" letters, discourses
on the "

" and hand-shaking house-organs,
as richly poured forth by the new school of poets of business. he had
painfully written out a first draft, and he intoned it now like a poet
delicate and distrait:

no kidding! i know you're interested in getting a house, not merely a
place where you hang up the old bonnet but a love-nest for the wife and

dictation over, with its need of sitting and thinking instead of
bustling around and making a noise and really doing something, babbitt
sat creakily back in his revolving desk-chair and beamed on miss mcgoun.
he was conscious of her as a girl, of black bobbed hair against demure
cheeks. a longing which was indistinguishable from loneliness enfeebled
him. while she waited, tapping a long, precise pencil-point on the
desk-tablet, he half identified her with the fairy girl of his dreams.
he imagined their eyes meeting with terrifying recognition; imagined
touching her lips with frightened reverence and--she was chirping,
"any more, mist' babbitt?" he grunted, "that winds it up, i guess," and

better 'n you do! but it isn't reasonable to expect us to sacrifice
eleven thousand or more just for neighborliness, is it! how about it,
lyte? you willing to come down?"

by warmly taking purdy's part, babbitt persuaded the benevolent mr. lyte
to reduce his price to twenty-one thousand dollars. at the right moment
babbitt snatched from a drawer the agreement he had had miss mcgoun type
out a week ago and thrust it into purdy's hands. he genially shook his
fountain pen to make certain that it was flowing, handed it to purdy,
and approvingly watched him sign.

the work of the world was being done. lyte had made something over
nine thousand dollars, babbitt had made a four-hundred-and-fifty dollar
commission, purdy had, by the sensitive mechanism of modern finance,
been provided with a business-building, and soon the happy inhabitants
of linton would have meat lavished upon

something." he sprang up, rekindled by the thought of lunching with paul
riesling.




chapter v

babbitt's preparations for leaving the office to its feeble self during
the hour and a half of his lunch-period were somewhat less elaborate
than the plans for a general european war.

he fretted to miss mcgoun, "what time you going to lunch? well, make
sure miss bannigan is in then. explain to her that if wiedenfeldt calls
up, she's to tell him i'm already having the title traced. and oh,
b' the way, remind me to-morrow to have penniman trace it. now if anybody
comes in looking for a cheap house, remember we got to shove that bangor
road place off onto somebody. if you need me, i'll be at the athletic
club. and--uh--and--uh--i'll be back by two."

he dusted the cigar-ashes off his vest. he placed a d

want me to go to maine with you? i shouldn't dream of going unless you
wanted me;' and you'd give in to save her feelings. oh, the devil! let's
have a shot at duck-pins."

during the game of duck-pins, a juvenile form of bowling, paul was
silent. as they came down the steps of the club, not more than half an
hour after the time at which babbitt had sternly told miss mcgoun he
would be back, paul sighed, "look here, old man, oughtn't to talked
about zilla way i did."

"rats, old man, it lets off steam."

"oh, i know! after spending all noon sneering at the conventional stuff,
i'm conventional enough to be ashamed of saving my life by busting out
with my fool troubles!"

"old paul, your nerves are kind of on the bum. i'm going to take you

unpleasant duty, but--i wonder if stan is sore? what's he saying to
mcgoun out there?"

so chill a wind of hatred blew from the outer office that the normal
comfort of his evening home-going was ruined. he was distressed by
losing that approval of his employees to which an executive is always
slave. ordinarily he left the office with a thousand enjoyable fussy
directions to the effect that there would undoubtedly be important tasks
to-morrow, and miss mcgoun and miss bannigan would do well to be there
early, and for heaven's sake remind him to call up conrad lyte soon 's
he came in. to-night he departed with feigned and apologetic liveliness.
he was as afraid of his still-faced clerks--of the eyes focused on him,
miss mcgoun staring with head lifted from her typing, miss bannigan
looking over her ledger, mat penniman craning around at his desk in the
dark alcove, stanley graff sullenly expressionless--as a parvenu before
the bleak propriety of his

all these reasons.

behind the gold and scarlet banner of his public achievements was the
dun background of office-routine: leases, sales-contracts, lists of
properties to rent. the evenings of oratory and committees and lodges
stimulated him like brandy, but every morning he was sandy-tongued. week
by week he accumulated nervousness. he was in open disagreement with his
outside salesman, stanley graff; and once, though her charms had always
kept him nickeringly polite to her, he snarled at miss mcgoun for
changing his letters.

but in the presence of paul riesling he relaxed. at least once a week
they fled from maturity. on saturday they played golf, jeering, "as
a golfer, you're a fine tennis-player," or they motored all sunday
afternoon, stopping at village lunchrooms to sit on high stools at a
counter and drink coffee from thick cups. sometimes paul came over in
the evening with his violin, and even zilla was silent as the lonely man
who had lost his way and forever crept down unfamiliar

"your name is--?"

"william varney--w. k. varney."

"oh, yes. that was the garrison house." babbitt sounded the buzzer. when
miss mcgoun came in, he demanded, "graff gone out?"

"yes, sir."

"will you look through his desk and see if there is a lease made out to
mr. varney on the garrison house?" to varney: "can't tell you how sorry
i am this happened. needless to say, i'll fire graff the minute he comes
in. and of course your lease stands. but there's one other thing i'd
like to do. i'll tell the owner not to pay us the commission but apply

ed through the february city, where trucks flung up a spattering
of slush and the sky was dark above dark brick cornices. he came back
miserable. he, who respected the law, had broken it by concealing the
federal crime of interception of the mails. but he could not see graff
go to jail and his wife suffer. worse, he had to discharge graff and
this was a part of office routine which he feared. he liked people
so much, he so much wanted them to like him that he could not bear
insulting them.

miss mcgoun dashed in to whisper, with the excitement of an approaching
scene, "he's here!"

"mr. graff? ask him to come in."

he tried to make himself heavy and calm in his chair, and to keep his
eyes expressionless. graff stalked in--a man of thirty-five, dapper,
eye-glassed, with a foppish mustache.

"want me?" said graff.

"yes. sit down."

graff continued to stand, grunting, "i suppose that old nut varney has
been in to see you. let me explain about him. he's a regular tightwad,
and he sticks out for

still more agitated when the ballots were counted and gunch said, "it's
a pleasure to announce that georgie babbitt will be the next assistant
gavel-wielder. i know of no man who stands more stanchly for common
sense and enterprise than good old george. come on, let's give him our
best long yell!"

as they adjourned, a hundred men crushed in to slap his back. he had
never known a higher moment. he drove away in a blur of wonder. he
lunged into his office, chuckling to miss mcgoun, "well, i guess you
better congratulate your boss! been elected vice-president of the
boosters!"

he was disappointed. she answered only, "yes--oh, mrs. babbitt's been
trying to get you on the 'phone." but the new salesman, fritz weilinger,
said, "by golly, chief, say, that's great, that's perfectly great! i'm
tickled to death! congratulations!"

babbitt called the house, and crowed to his wife, "heard you were trying
to get me, myra. say, you got to hand it to little georgie, this time!

e want?

he blundered into the living-room, lay on the davenport, hands behind
his head.

what did he want? wealth? social position? travel? servants? yes, but
only incidentally.

"i give it up," he sighed.

but he did know that he wanted the presence of paul riesling; and from
that he stumbled into the admission that he wanted the fairy girl--in
the flesh. if there had been a woman whom he loved, he would have fled
to her, humbled his forehead on her knees.

he thought of his stenographer, miss mcgoun. he thought of the prettiest
of the manicure girls at the hotel thornleigh barber shop. as he fell
asleep on the davenport he felt that he had found something in life, and
that he had made a terrifying, thrilling break with everything that was
decent and normal.

he had forgotten, next morning, that he was a conscious rebel, but he
was irritable in the office and at the eleven o'clock drive of telephone
calls and visitors he did something he had often desired and never
dared: he left the o

as they lighted their cigars he mumbled, "got to get back," and on a
chorus of "if you will go spending your mornings with lady ushers at the
movies!" he escaped. he heard them giggling. he was embarrassed. while
he was most bombastically agreeing with the coat-man that the weather
was warm, he was conscious that he was longing to run childishly with
his troubles to the comfort of the fairy child.

he kept miss mcgoun after he had finished dictating. he searched for a
topic which would warm her office impersonality into friendliness.

"where you going on your vacation?" he purred.

"i think i'll go up-state to a farm do you want me to have the siddons
lease copied this afternoon?"

"oh, no hurry about it.... i suppose you have a great time when you get
away from us cranks in the office."

she rose and gathered her pencils. "oh, nobody's cranky here i think i
can get it copied after i do the letters."

trying to discover how approachable was miss mcgoun. "course! knew there

eddie swanson, the motor-car agent who lived across the street from
babbitt, was giving a sunday supper. his wife louetta, young louetta who
loved jazz in music and in clothes and laughter, was at her wildest. she
cried, "we'll have a real party!" as she received the guests. babbitt
had uneasily felt that to many men she might be alluring; now he
admitted that to himself she was overwhelmingly alluring. mrs. babbitt

round, and enjoy himself with his family,
his business, the fellows at the club?" what was he getting out of
rebellion? misery and shame--the shame of being treated as an offensive
small boy by a ragamuffin like ida putiak! and yet--always he came back
to "and yet." whatever the misery, he could not regain contentment with
a world which, once doubted, became absurd.

only, he assured himself, he was "through with this chasing after
girls."

by noontime he was not so sure even of that. if in miss mcgoun, louetta
swanson, and ida he had failed to find the lady kind and lovely, it did
not prove that she did not exist. he was hunted by the ancient thought
that somewhere must exist the not impossible she who would understand
him, value him, and make him happy.

mrs. babbitt returned in august.

on her previous absences he had missed her reassuring buzz and of her
arrival he had made a fete. now, though he dared not hurt her by letting
a hint of it appear in his letters, he was sorry that she

bubbled, "i've often thought of that! if i had the money, i'd go down to
tinker's falls and open a swell shoe store."

after supper joe proposed a game of stud-poker but babbitt refused with
brevity, and joe contentedly went to bed at eight. babbitt sat on the
stump, facing the dark pond, slapping mosquitos. save the snoring guide,
there was no other human being within ten miles. he was lonelier than he
had ever been in his life. then he was in zenith.

he was worrying as to whether miss mcgoun wasn't paying too much for
carbon paper. he was at once resenting and missing the persistent
teasing at the roughnecks' table. he was wondering what zilla riesling
was doing now. he was wondering whether, after the summer's maturity
of being a garageman, ted would "get busy" in the university. he was
thinking of his wife. "if she would only--if she wouldn't be so darn
satisfied with just settling down--no! i won't! i won't go back! i'll
be fifty in three years. sixty in thirteen years. i'm goin

miss mcgoun came into his private office at three in the afternoon with
"lissen, mr. babbitt; there's a mrs. judique on the 'phone--wants to see
about some repairs, and the salesmen are all out. want to talk to her?"

"all right."

the voice of tanis judique was clear and pleasant. the black cylinder
of the telephone-receiver seemed to hold a tiny animated image of her:
lustrous eyes, delicate nose, gentle chin.

"this is mrs. judique. do you remember me? you drove me up here to the

so much a fool as they think!"

the great strike was over, the strikers beaten. except that vergil
gunch seemed less cordial, there were no visible effects of babbitt's
treachery to the clan. the oppressive fear of criticism was gone, but a
diffident loneliness remained. now he was so exhilarated that, to prove
he wasn't, he droned about the office for fifteen minutes, looking at
blue-prints, explaining to miss mcgoun that this mrs. scott wanted more
money for her house--had raised the asking-price--raised it from seven
thousand to eighty-five hundred--would miss mcgoun be sure and put
it down on the card--mrs. scott's house--raise. when he had thus
established himself as a person unemotional and interested only in
business, he sauntered out. he took a particularly long time to start
his car; he kicked the tires, dusted the glass of the speedometer, and
tightened the screws holding the wind-shield spot-light

this slight, pale, industrious swede,
that it was vulgar to think of her as going to an ordinary home to eat
hash. she was a perfectly oiled and enameled machine, and she ought,
each evening, to have been dusted off and shut in her desk beside her
too-slim, too-frail pencil points. she took dictation swiftly, her
typing was perfect, but babbitt became jumpy when he tried to work with
her. she made him feel puffy, and at his best-beloved daily jokes she
looked gently inquiring. he longed for miss mcgoun's return, and thought
of writing to her.

then he heard that miss mcgoun had, a week after leaving him, gone over
to his dangerous competitors, sanders, torrey and wing.

he was not merely annoyed; he was frightened. "why did she quit, then?"
he worried. "did she have a hunch my business is going on the rocks? and
it was sanders got the street traction deal. rats--sinking ship!"

gray fear loomed always by him now. he watched fritz weilinger, the
young salesman, and wondered if he too would lea
