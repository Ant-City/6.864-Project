own sinews. to end a tale of length,
    troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.
  nestor. most wisely hath ulysses here discover'd
    the fever whereof all our power is sick.
  agamemnon. the nature of the sickness found, ulysses,
    what is the remedy?
  ulysses. the great achilles, whom opinion crowns
    the sinew and the forehand of our host,
    having his ear full of his airy fame,
    grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent
    lies mocking our designs; with him patroclus
    upon a lazy bed the livelong day
    breaks scurril jests;
    and with ridiculous and awkward action-
    which, slanderer, he imitation calls-
    he pageants us. sometime, great agamemnon,
    thy topless deputation he puts on;
    and like a strutting player whose conceit
    lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
    to hear the wooden dialogue and sound
    'twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage-
    such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming
    he acts t

of roaring typhon dropp'd,
    would seem hyperboles. at this fusty stuff
    the large achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,
    from his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;
    cries 'excellent! 'tis agamemnon just.
    now play me nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,
    as he being drest to some oration.'
    that's done-as near as the extremest ends
    of parallels, as like vulcan and his wife;
    yet god achilles still cries 'excellent!
    'tis nestor right. now play him me, patroclus,
    arming to answer in a night alarm.'
    and then, forsooth, the faint defects of age
    must be the scene of mirth: to cough and spit
    and, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,
    shake in and out the rivet. and at this sport
    sir valour dies; cries 'o, enough, patroclus;
    or give me ribs of steel! i shall split all
    in pleasure of my spleen.' and in this fashion
    all our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,
    severals and generals of grace exact,
    achievemen

achilles. o, tell, tell,
  thersites. i'll decline the whole question. agamemnon commands
    achilles; achilles is my lord; i am patroclus' knower; and
    patroclus is a fool.
  patroclus. you rascal!
  thersites. peace, fool! i have not done.
  achilles. he is a privileg'd man. proceed, thersites.
  thersites. agamemnon is a fool; achilles is a fool; thersites is a
    fool; and, as aforesaid, patroclus is a fool.
  achilles. derive this; come.
  thersites. agamemnon is a fool to offer to command achilles;
    achilles is a fool to be commanded of agamemnon; thersites is a
    fool to serve such a fool; and this patroclus is a fool positive.
  patroclus. why am i a fool?
  thersites. make that demand of the creator. it suffices me thou
    art. look you, who comes here?

    achilles.
  nestor. all the better; their fraction is more our wish than their
    faction. but it was a strong composure a fool could disunite!

    are legs for necessity, not for flexure.
  patroclus. achilles bids me say he is much sorry
    if any thing more than your sport and pleasure
    did move your greatness and this noble state
    to call upon him; he hopes it is no other
    but for your health and your digestion sake,
    an after-dinner's breath.
  agamemnon. hear you, patroclus.

    i'll send the fool to ajax, and desire him
    t' invite the troyan lords, after the combat,
    to see us here unarm'd. i have a woman's longing,

    livers, wheezing lungs, bladders full of imposthume, sciaticas,

    to curse thus?
  thersites. do i curse thee?
  patroclus. why, no, you ruinous butt; you whoreson
    indistinguishable cur, no.
  thersites. no! why art thou, then, exasperate, thou idle immaterial
    skein of sleid silk, thou green sarcenet flap for a sore eye,
    thou tassel of a prodigal's purse, thou? ah, how the poor world is
    pest'red with such water-flies-diminutives of nature!

  achilles. my sweet patroclus, i am thwarted quite
    from my great purpose in to-morrow's battle.
    here is a letter from queen hecuba,
    a token from her daughter, my fair love,
    both taxing me and gaging me to keep
    an oath that i have sworn. i will not break it.
    fall greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay;
    my major vow lies here, this i'll obey.
    come, come, thersites, help to trim my tent;

    away, patroclus!              exit with patroclus
  thersites. with too much blood and too little brain these two may
    run mad; but, if with too much brain and to little blood they do,
    i'll be a curer of madmen. here's agamemnon, an honest fellow
    enough, and one that loves quails, but he has not so much brain
    as ear-wax; and the goodly transformation of jupiter there, his
    brother, the bull, the primitive statue and oblique memorial of
    cuckolds, a thrifty shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his
    brother's leg-t

my lord.
    hector, by this, is arming him in troy;
    ajax, your guard, stays to conduct you home.
  troilus. have with you, prince. my courteous lord, adieu.
    fairwell, revolted fair!-and, diomed,
    stand fast and wear a castle on thy head.
  ulysses. i'll bring you to the gates.
  troilus. accept distracted thanks.

            exeunt troilus, aeneas. and ulysses

  thersites. would i could meet that rogue diomed! i would croak like
    a raven; i would bode, i would bode. patroclus will give me
    anything for the intelligence of this whore; the parrot will not
    do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab. lechery,
    lechery! still wars and lechery! nothing else holds fashion. a
    burning devil take them!

    unarm, unarm, and do not fight to-day.

  agamemnon. renew, renew! the fierce polydamus
    hath beat down enon; bastard margarelon
    hath doreus prisoner,
    and stands colossus-wise, waving his beam,
    upon the pashed corses of the kings
    epistrophus and cedius. polixenes is slain;
    amphimacus and thoas deadly hurt;
    patroclus ta'en, or slain; and palamedes
    sore hurt and bruis'd. the dreadful sagittary
    appals our numbers. haste we, diomed,
    to reinforcement, or we perish all.

    there is a thousand hectors in the field;
    now here he fights on galathe his horse,
    and there lacks work; anon he's there afoot,
    and there they fly or die, like scaled sculls

    before the belching whale; then is he yonder,
    and there the strawy greeks, ripe for his edge,
    fall down before him like the mower's swath.
    here, there, and everywhere, he leaves and takes;
    dexterity so obeying appetite
    that what he will he does, and does so much
    that proof is call'd impossibility.

                       enter ulysses

  ulysses. o, courage, courage, courage, princes! great
    achilles is arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance.
    patroclus' wounds have rous'd his drowsy blood,
    together with his mangled myrmidons,
    that noseless, handless, hack'd and chipp'd, come to
    him, crying on hector. ajax hath lost a friend
    and foams at mouth, and he is arm'd and at it,
    roaring for troilus; who hath done to-day
    mad and fantastic execution,
    engaging and redeeming of himself
    with such a careless force and forceless care
    as if that luck, in very spite of cunning,
    bade him win all.
