part of his middle, and went to the council chamber.
 all during the long session he kept expecting someone to drop the other shoe. but no one did
and no aide came in with any message for him. he was forced to conclude that the fact that smith was
missing actually was close held in his own personal staff unlikely as that seemed.
 the secretary general wanted very badly to close his eyes and hope that the whole horrid mess
would go away, but events would not let him. nor would his wife let him.
 agnes douglas' personal saint, by choice, was evita peron, whom she fancied she resembled.
her own persona, the mask that she held out to the world, was that of helper and satellite to the great
man she was privileged to call husband. she even held this mask up to herself, for she had the red
queen's convenient ability to believe anything she wished to believe. nevertheless, her own political
philosophy could have been stated baldly (which it never was) as a belief that men should rule the world
and women sh

never crossed her mind . . . still less could she have believed that there was any connection between her
behavior and her father's wish for a son . . or her own jealousy of her mother. such evil thoughts never
entered her head. she loved her parents and had fresh flowers put on their graves on all appropriate
occasions; she loved her husband and often said so publicly; she was proud of her womanhood and said
so publicly almost as often-p--she frequently joined the two assertions.
 agnes douglas did not wait for her husband to act in the case of the missing man from mars. all
of her husband's personal staff took orders as readily from her as from him . . . in some cases, even more
readily. she sent for the chief executive assistant for civil information, as mr. douglas's press agent was
called, then turned her attention to the most urgent emergency measure, that of getting a fresh horoscope
cast. there was a private, scrambled link from her suite in the palace to madame vesant's studio

while she could hear his even, steady tones: "confidence, kiddo, confidence! have confidence in yourself
and the yokels will have confidence in you. you owe it to them."
 she felt much better now and started writing out the results of the two horoscopes for the
douglases. that done, it turned out to be easy to write one for smith, and she found, as she always did,
that the words on paper proved themselves-they were all so beautifully true! she was just finishing as
agnes douglas called again. "allie? haven't you finished yet?"
 "just completed," madame vesant answered with brisk self-confidence. "you realize, of course,
that young smith's horoscope presented an unusual and very difficult problem in the science. born, as he
was, on another planet, every aspect and attitude had to be recalculated. the influence of the sun is
lessened; the influence of diana is missing almost completely. jupiter is thrown into a novel, perhaps i

 path a little, make her heavy burdens a little easier to carry. it made her
feel good to help agnes.
 it made madame vesant feel good to be treated as an almost-equal by the wife of the secretary
general, too, although she did not think of it that way, not being snobbish at heart. but young becky
vesey had been so insignificant that the precinct committeeman could never remember her name even
though he noticed her bust measurement. becky vesey had not resented it; becky liked people. she
liked agnes douglas now.
 becky vesey liked everybody.
 she sat a while longer, enjoying the warm glow and the respite from pressure and just a nip more
of the tonic, while her shrewd and able brain shuffled the bits and pieces she had picked up. presently,
without consciously making a decision, she called her stockbroker and instructed him to sell lunar
enterprises short.
 he snorted. "allie, you're crazy. that reducing diet is weakening your mind."

how do you feel about astrology?"
 "never touch the stuff. prefer brandy."
 "well, that's a matter of taste. but-see here, jubal, if you ever let on to anyone that i told you

 "noted. agreed. proceed."
 "well, agnes douglas does touch the stuff.., and i know where she gets it. her astrologer can
call mrs. douglas at any time-and, believe you me, mrs. douglas has the ear of the secretary general
whenever she chooses. you can call her astrologer - . . and the rest is up to you."
 "i don't seem to recall any astrologers on my christmas card list," jubal answered dubiously.
"what's his name?"

 "yes. if you can swing it. here, let me give you my number-and i'll be sitting right here, hoping
for a call . . . until they pick me up. if you can't swing it . . . thanks anyway, becky, thanks a lot. i'll know
you tried."
 "don't switch off!" she said sharply.
 "eh?"
 "keep the circuit, doc, while i see what i can do. if i have any luck, they can patch right through
this phone and save time. so hold on." madame vesant left the screen without saying good-by, then
called agnes douglas. she spoke with calm confidence, pointing out to agnes that this was precisely the
development foretold by the stars-and exactly on schedule. now had come the critical instant when
agnes must guide and sustain her husband, using all her womanly wit and wisdom to see that he acted
wisely and without delay. "agnes dear, this configuration will not be repeated in a thousand years-mars,
venus and mercury in perfect trine, just as venus reaches the meridian, making venus dominant. thus
you see-"
 "a

 "well- all right, allie. i've got to dig joseph out of some silly conference but i'll get him. keep
this line open. give me the number of the phone you have this doctor rackshaw on-or can you transfer
the call there?"
 "i can switch it over here. just get mr. douglas. hurry, dear."
 "i will."
 when agnes douglas' face left the screen, becky went to still another phone. her profession
required ample phone service; it was her largest single business expense. humming happily she called her
broker.
