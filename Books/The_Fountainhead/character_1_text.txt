"fifteen dollars a week. that's all i can pay you."

"yes."

"you're a damn fool. you should have gone to someone else. i'll kill you if you go to anyone 
else. what's your name?"

"howard roark."

"if you're late, i'll fire you."

"yes."

roark extended his hand for the drawings.

"leave these here!" bellowed cameron. "now get out!"

"toohey," said guy francon, "ellsworth toohey. pretty decent of him, don't you think? read 
it, peter."

francon leaned jovially across his desk and handed to keating the august issue of new 
frontiers. new frontiers had a white cover with a black emblem that combined a palette, a 
lyre, a hammer, a screw driver and a rising sun; it had a circulation of thirty thousand and a 
following that described itself as the intellectual vanguard of the country; no one had ever 
risen to challenge the description. keating read from an article entitle

"oh, he does, does he?"

"but you don't understand. he means it kindly. it's the way he says things. you'll have a lot in 
common. maybe he could help you. he knows something about architecture, too. you'll love 
uncle ellsworth."

"who?" said keating.

"my uncle."

"say," keating asked, his voice a little husky, "what's your

uncle's name?"

"ellsworth toohey. why?" his hands fell limply. he sat staring at her. "what's the matter, 
peter?"

he swallowed. she saw the jerking motion of his throat. then he said, his voice hard:

"listen, katie, i don't want to meet your uncle."

"but why?"

"i don't want to meet him. not through you....you see, katie, you don't know me. i'm the kind 
that uses people. i don't want to use you. ever. don't let me. not you."

stengel rattling uselessly within it. francon had said to him about the building: "it must have 
dignity, you know, dignity...nothing freaky...a structure of elegance...and stay within the 
budget," which was francon's conception of giving his designer ideas and letting him work 
them out. through a cold stupor, keating thought of the clients laughing in his face; he heard 
the thin, omnipotent voice of ellsworth toohey calling his attention to the opportunities open to 
him in the field of plumbing. he hated every piece of stone on the face of the earth. he hated 
himself for having chosen to be an architect.

when he began to draw, he tried not to think of the job he was doing; he thought only that 
francon had done it, and stengel, even heyer, and all the others, and that he could do it, if 
they could.

y reading for anyone aspiring to the title of intellectual."

there seemed to be a great many aspiring to that title. readers acquired erudition without 
study, authority without cost, judgment without effort. it was pleasant to look at buildings and 
criticize them with a professional manner and with the memory of page 439; to hold artistic 
discussions and exchange the same sentences from the same paragraphs. in distinguished 
drawing rooms one could soon hear it said: "architecture? oh, yes, ellsworth toohey."

according to his principles, ellsworth m. toohey listed no architect by name in the text of his 
book--"the myth-building, hero-worshipping method of historical research has always been 
obnoxious to me." the names appeared only in footnotes. several of these referred to guy 
francon, "who has a tendency to the overornate, but must be commended for his loyalty to 
the strict tradition of classicism." one note referred to henry cameron, "prominent once as 
one of the fathers of the so-called

"yes, god damn it, i've heard about your uncle ellsworth!...i'm sorry, katie...forgive me, 
darling, i didn't mean to be rude, but i've been hearing about your uncle all day long. i know, 
it's wonderful and all that, only look, we're not going to talk about him again tonight!"

"no, of course not. i'm sorry. i understand. i'll be waiting for you."

"so long, katie."

he had heard the latest story about ellsworth toohey, but he did not want to think of it 
because it brought him back to the annoying subject of the strike. six months ago, on the 
wave of his success with sermons in stone, ellsworth toohey had been signed to write "one 
small voice," a daily syndicated column for the wynand papers. it appeared in the banner 
and had started as a department of art criticism, but grown into an informal tribune from which 
ellsworth m. toohey pronounced verdicts on art, literature, new york restaurants,

nal crises and sociology--mainly sociology. it had been a great success. but the 
building strike had placed ellsworth m. toohey in a difficult position. he made no secret of his 
sympathy with the strikers, but he had said nothing in his column, for no one could say what 
he pleased on the papers owned by gail wynand save gail wynand. however, a mass 
meeting of strike sympathizers had been called for this evening. many famous men were to 
speak, ellsworth toohey among them. at least, toohey's name had been announced.

the event caused a great deal of curious speculation and bets were made on whether toohey 
would dare to appear. "he will," keating had heard a draftsman insist vehemently, "he'll 
sacrifice himself. he's that kind. he's the only honest man in print."

"he won't," another had said. "do you realize what it means to pull a stunt like that on 
wynand? once wynand gets it in for a man, he'll break the guy for sure as hell's fire. nobody

 the thing was gone. "but i 
wanted to be with you, peter...i want to be with you always." the thing gave a last jerk, not in 
the meaning of what she said, but in the reason that had prompted her to say it. then it was 
gone, and keating smiled; his fingers sought her bare wrist between her sleeve and glove, 
and her skin was warm against his....

many days later keating heard the story that was being told all over town. it was said that on 
the day after the mass meeting gail wynand had given ellsworth toohey a raise in salary. 
toohey had been furious and had tried to refuse it. "you cannot bribe me, mr. wynand," he 
said. "i'm not bribing you," wynand had answered; "don't flatter yourself."
#

when the strike was settled, interrupted construction went forward with a spurt throughout the 
city, and keating found himself spending days and nights at work, with new commissions 
pouring into the office. francon smiled happily at everybody and gave a small party for his 
staff, to erase the memory of an

the presence of the thin white hand he saw hanging over the arm of the chair before him.

"i don't know. i've never met him."

"you haven't?"

"no."

"oh, i've heard he's so interesting!"

"undoubtedly. when i'm in a mood for something decadent i'll probably meet him."

"do you know toohey?"

"oh," she said. he saw what he had seen in her eyes before, and he did not like the sweet 
gaiety of her voice. "oh, ellsworth toohey. of course i know him. he's wonderful. he's a man 
i always enjoy talking to. he's such a perfect black-guard."

"why, miss francon! you're the first person who's ever..."

"i'm not trying to shock you. i meant all of it. i admire him. he's so complete. you don't meet

"what do you want to be avenged for?" she looked at him, her eyelids lifted for a moment, so 

that her eyes did not seem rectangular, but soft and clear.

"that was very clever of you," she said. "that was the first clever thing you've said."

"because you knew what to pick out of all the rubbish i uttered. so i'll have to answer you. i'd

charming knack for destroying the earnestness of his own moment: "i like to indulge in the 
luxury of commenting solely upon interesting subjects. i do not consider myself one of these."

peter keating read the story. and because he knew that it was an action which he would 
never have committed, he admired it tremendously.

then he thought, with a familiar twinge of annoyance, that he had not been able to meet 
ellsworth toohey. toohey had left on a lecture tour shortly after the award in the cosmo-
slotnick competition, and the brilliant gatherings keating had attended ever since were made 
empty by the absence of the one man he'd been most eager to meet. no mention of keating's 
name had appeared in toohey's column. keating turned hopefully, as he did each morning, to 
"one small voice" in the banner. but "one small voice" was subtitled "songs and things" 
today, and was devoted to proving the superiority of folk so

 had interviewed mallory and said: 
"...in recognition of your unusual ability...of course you have no name, but you will have, after 
a commission like this...they don't come every day like this building of mine."

he had not liked mallory. mallory's eyes were like black holes left after a fire not quite put out, 
and mallory had not smiled once. he was twenty-four years old, had had one show of his 
work, but not many commissions. his work was strange and too violent. keating remembered 
that ellsworth toohey had said once, long ago, in "one small voice."

"mr. mallory's human figures would have been very fine were it not for the hypothesis that god 
created the world and the human form. had mr. mallory been entrusted with the job, he might, 
perhaps, have done better than the almighty, if we are to judge by what he passes as human 
bodies in stone. or would he?"

keating had been baffled by mr. slotnick's choice, until he heard that dimples williams had

could very 
well think that and all the rest of the beautiful stuff.

then he seized the telephone, he spoke to a high, flat voice which belonged to ellsworth 
toohey's secretary, and he made an appointment to see toohey at four-thirty of the next 
afternoon.

in the hours that followed, his daily work assumed a new relish. it was as if his usual activity 
had been only a bright, flat mural and had now become a noble bas-relief, pushed forward, 
given a three-dimensional reality by the words of ellsworth toohey.

guy francon descended from his office once in a while, for no ascertainable purpose. the 
subtler shades of his shirts and socks matched the gray of his temples. he stood smiling 
benevolently in silence. keating flashed past him in the drafting room and acknowledged his 
presence, not stopping, but slowing his steps long enough to plant a crackling bit of 
newspaper into the folds of the mauve handkerchief in francon's breast-pocket, with "read 
that when you have time, guy." he added, his s

teps halfway across the next room: "want to 
have lunch with me today, guy? wait for me at the plaza."

when he came back from lunch, keating was stopped by a young draftsman who asked, his 
voice high with excitement:

"say, mr. keating, who's it took a shot at ellsworth toohey?"

keating managed to gasp out:

"who is it did what?"

"shot mr. toohey."

"who?"

"that's what i want to know, who."

"shot...ellsworth toohey?"

"that's what i saw in the paper in the restaurant a guy had. didn't have time to get one."

"he's...killed?"

"that's what i don't know. saw only it said about a shot."

"if he's dead, does that mean they won't publish his column tomorrow?"

"dunno. why, mr. keating?"

"go get me a paper."

"but i've got to..."

"get me that paper, you damned idiot!"

the story was there, in the afternoon papers. a shot had been fired at ellsworth toohey that 
morning, as he stepped out of his car in front

waiting," and had hurried on upstairs to the microphone where, never mentioning the incident, 
he delivered a half-hour's speech from memory, as he always did. the assailant had said 
nothing when arrested.

keating stared--his throat dry--at the name of the assailant. it was steven mallory.

ere was nothing to concern him 
directly in what had happened, except his wish that it had been someone else, anyone but 
steven mallory; and that he didn't know why he should wish this.

steven mallory had remained silent. he had given no explanation of his act. at first, it was 
supposed that he might have been prompted by despair at the loss of his commission for the 
cosmo-slotnick building, since it was learned that he lived in revolting poverty. but it was 
learned, beyond any doubt, that ellsworth toohey had had no connection whatever with his 
loss. toohey had never spoken to mr. slotnick about steven mallory. toohey had not seen 
the statue of "industry." on this point mallory had broken his silence to admit that he had 
never met toohey nor seen him in person before, nor known any of toohey's friends. "do you 
think that mr. toohey was in some way responsible for your losing that commission?" he was 
asked. mallory had answered: "no."

"then why?" mallory said nothing.

the thought that kept keating uneasily awake for many hours, that night, was the groundless 
certainty that toohey felt exactly as he did. he knows, thought keating, and i know, that there 
is--in steven mallory's motive--a greater danger than in his murderous attempt. but we shall 
never know his motive. or shall we?...and then he touched the core of fear: it was the sudden

learning that motive.

ellsworth toohey's secretary rose in a leisurely manner, when keating entered, and opened 
for him the door into ellsworth toohey's office.

keating had grown past the stage of experiencing anxiety at the prospect of meeting a famous 
man, but he experienced it in the moment when he saw the door opening under her hand. he 
wondered what toohey really looked like. he remembered the magnificent voice he had heard 
in the lobby of the strike meeting, and he imagined a giant of a man, with a rich mane of hair,

"yes, of course," muttered keating, "that's always been my favorite--the temple of nike

certain of it. i was certain you'd say it. you have a very handsome face, peter keating, when 
you don't stare like this--which is really quite unnecessary."

and toohey was laughing suddenly, laughing quite obviously, quite insultingly, at keating and 
at himself; it was as if he were underscoring the falseness of the whole procedure. keating sat 
aghast for an instant; and then he found himself laughing easily in answer, as if at h

have to worry about saying the right things, because he was being led gently into saying them 
without any effort on his part. "i've always known it would be an important moment when i met

"yes?"

"...i even thought, so often, when drawing, is this the kind of building that ellsworth toohey 
would say is good? i tried to see it like that, through your eyes...i...i've..." toohey listened 
watchfully. "i've always wanted to meet you because you're such a profound thinker and a

it was keating's first visit to the distinguished residential hotel where catherine and her uncle 
had moved recently. he did not notice much about the apartment, beyond remembering that it 
was simple, very clean and smartly modest, that it contained a great number of books and 
very few pictures, but these authentic and precious. one never remembered the apartment of 
ellsworth toohey, only its host. the host, on this sunday afternoon, wore a dark gray suit, 

correct as a uniform, and bedroom slippers of black patent leather trimmed with red; the 
slippers mocked the severe elegance of the suit, yet completed the elegance as an audacious 
anticlimax. he sat in a broad, low chair and his face wore an expression of cautious 
gentleness, so cautious that keating and catherine felt, at times, as if they were insignificant 
soap bubbles.

"a cosmic joke."

but a peculiar sensation remained in keating's mind: the feeling of an aftertaste. he would 
experience a dim flash of it while working on some important structure he liked; he would 
experience it in the moments when he felt proud of his work. he could not identify the quality 
of the feeling; but he knew that part of it was a sense of shame.

once, he confessed it to ellsworth toohey. toohey laughed. "that's good for you, peter. one 
must never allow oneself to acquire an exaggerated sense of one's own importance. there's 
no necessity to burden oneself with absolutes."

choice. either course taken would be taken under compulsion: she could leave her work, 
because he had made her want to leave it, or she could remain, hating it, in order to keep her 
life unchanged, in defiance of him. the last was harder.

she raised her head. she said: "just a joke, alvah. just wanted to see what you'd say. i'm not

she had been back at work for a few days when ellsworth toohey walked into her office.

"hello, dominique," he said. "just heard you're back."

"hello, ellsworth."

"i'm glad. you know, i've always had the feeling that you'll walk out on us some morning 
without any reason."

"the feeling, ellsworth? or the hope?"

he was looking at her, his eyes as kindly, his smile as charming as ever; but there was a tinge 
of self-mockery in the charm, as if he knew that she did not approve of it, and a tinge of

at his trial for the assault on ellsworth toohey, steven mallory refused to disclose his motive. 
he made no statement. he seemed indifferent to any possible sentence. but ellsworth 
toohey created a minor sensation when he appeared, unsolicited, in mallory's defense. he 
pleaded with the judge for leniency; he explained that he had no desire to see mallory's future 
and career destroyed. everybody in the courtroom was touched--except steven mallory. 
steven mallory listened and looked as if he were enduring some special process of cruelty.

from face to face, and stopped on his. he bowed and nodded vigorously, with the smile of 
greeting a private possession. she inclined her head, he saw her lashes touching her cheeks 
for an instant as her eyes closed, and then she looked at him again. she sat looking at him for 
a long moment, without smiling, as if she were rediscovering something in his face. he had 
not seen her since spring. he thought that she looked a little tired and lovelier than his 
memory of her.

then he turned to ellsworth toohey once more and he listened. the words he heard were as 
stirring as ever, but his pleasure in them had an edge of uneasiness. he looked at dominique. 
she did not belong in this room, at this meeting. he could not say why, but the certainty of it 
was enormous and oppressive. it was not her beauty, it was not her insolent elegance. but 
something made her an outsider. it was as if they had all been comfortably naked, and a 
person had entered fully clothed, suddenly making them self-conscious an

she dropped the match into an ash tray on a table beside her. he saw her drop the match into 
the ash tray; he felt as if that movement of her wrist had tossed the match into all their faces. 
he thought that he was being preposterous. but he noticed that ellsworth toohey never 
looked at her as he spoke.

when the meeting ended, toohey rushed over to her.

"dominique, my dear!" he said brightly. "shall i consider myself flattered?"

"if you wish."

"had i known that you were interested, i would have sent you a very special invitation."

"but you didn't think i'd be interested?"

"no, frankly, i..."

to meet him again.

"there is nothing as useless, my dear kiki," said ellsworth toohey, "as a rich woman who 
makes herself a profession of entertaining. but then, all useless things have charm. like 
aristocracy, for instance, the most useless conception of all."

kiki holcombe wrinkled her nose in a cute little pout of reproach, but she liked the comparison 
to aristocracy. three crystal chandeliers blazed over her florentine ballroom, and when she 
looked up at toohey the lights stood reflected in her eyes, making them a moist collection of

them like a square box of space, grotesquely out of scale; and it was this wasted expanse of 
air imprisoned above them that gave the occasion an aspect of regal luxury; it was like the lid 
of a jewel case, unnecessarily large over a flat bottom holding a single small gem.

the guests moved in two broad, changing currents that drew them all, sooner or later, toward 
two whirlpools; at the center of one stood ellsworth toohey, of the other--peter keating. 
evening clothes were not becoming to ellsworth toohey; the rectangle of white shirt front 
prolonged his face, stretching him out into two dimensions; the wings of his tie made his thin 
neck look like that of a plucked chicken, pale, bluish and ready to be twisted by a single 
movement of some strong fist. but he wore his clothes better than any man present. he wore 
them with the careless impertinence of utter ease in the unbecoming, and the very

every part of the ballroom. he looked at the people, all these trim, perfumed, silk-rustling 
people lacquered with light, dripping with light, as they had all been dripping with shower water 
a few hours ago, getting ready to come here and stand in homage before a man named peter 
keating. there were moments when he forgot that he was peter keating and he glanced at a 
mirror, at his own figure, he wanted to join in the general admiration for it.

once the current left him face to face with ellsworth toohey. keating smiled like a boy 
emerging from a stream on a summer day, glowing, invigorated, restless with energy. toohey 
stood looking at him; toohey's hands had slipped negligently into his trouser pockets, making 
his jacket flare out over his thin hips; he seemed to teeter faintly on his small feet; his eyes 
were attentive in enigmatic appraisal.

"now this, ellsworth...this...isn't it a wonderful evening?" said keating, like a child to a mother 
who would understand, and a little like a dru

let her see him being delivered to the crowd before her eyes, being surrendered to any person 
who wished to own him for a few moments. he knew that this was harder for her to watch 
than the sun and the drill in the quarry. she stood obediently, watching. she did not expect 

him to notice her again; she had to remain there as long as he was in this room.

there was another person, that night, abnormally aware of roark's presence, aware from the 
moment roark had entered the room. ellsworth toohey had seen him enter. toohey had 
never set eyes on him before and did not know him. but toohey stood looking at him for a 
long time.

then toohey moved through the crowd, and smiled at his friends. but between smiles and 
sentences, his eyes went back to the man with the orange hair. he looked at the man as he 
looked occasionally at the pavement from a window on the thirtieth floor, wondering about his 
own body were it to be hurled down and what would happen when he struck against that

"that?" said snyte. "howard roark. you know, the enright house."

"oh," said toohey.

"what?"

"of course. it would be."

"want to meet him?"

"no," said toohey. "no, i don't want to meet him."

for the rest of the evening whenever some figure obstructed toohey's view of the hall, his 
head would jerk impatiently to find roark again. he did not want to look at roark; he had to 
look; just as he always had to look down at that distant pavement, dreading the sight.

that evening, ellsworth toohey was conscious of no one but roark. roark did not know that 
toohey existed in the room.

when roark left, dominique stood counting the minutes, to be certain that he would be lost to 
sight in the streets before she could trust herself to go out. then she moved to leave.

kiki holcombe's thin, moist fingers clasped her hand in parting, clasped it vaguely and slipped 
up to hold her wrist for a moment.

"and, my dear," asked kiki holcombe, "what did you think of that new one, you know, i saw

dominique turned. ellsworth toohey stood there, smiling, watching her face attentively.

"you..." she began and stopped.

"of course," said toohey, bowing faintly in understanding affirmative of what she had not said. 
"do give me credit for discernment, dominique, somewhat equal to yours. though not for 
esthetic enjoyment. i'll leave that part of it to you. but we do see things, at times, which are not 
obvious, don't we--you and i?"

"what things?"

feather boa. it will attract attention--but only to the immense audacity of mr. roark's conceit. 
when this building is erected, it will be a wound on the face of our city. a wound, too, is 
colorful."

this appeared in the column "your house" by dominique francon, a week after the party at 
the home of kiki holcombe.

on the morning of its appearance ellsworth toohey walked into dominique's office. he held a 

copy of the banner, with the page bearing her column turned toward her. he stood silently, 
rocking a little on his small feet. it seemed as if the expression of his eyes had to be heard, 
not seen: it was a visual roar of laughter. his lips were folded primly, innocently.

"well?" she asked.

"where did you meet roark before that party?"

she sat looking at him, one arm flung over the back of her chair, a pencil dangling 
precariously between the ti

said: "have him come

then the door opened; against the light of the hall she saw a long neck and sloping shoulders, 
like the silhouette of a bottle; a rich, creamy voice said, "good evening, dominique," and she 
recognized ellsworth toohey whom she had never asked to her house.

she smiled. she said: "good evening, ellsworth. i haven't seen you for such a long time."

"you should have expected me now, don't you think so?" he turned to the maid: "cointreau, 
please, if you have it, and i'm sure you do."

the maid glanced at dominique, wide-eyed; dominique nodded silently, and the maid went 
out, closing the door.

"busy, of course?" said toohey, glancing at the littered desk. "very becoming, dominique.

she shrugged.

"as for the rest," he added, "i think you can answer that yourself."

she nodded slowly to the bright little point of her cigarette's reflection on the glass plane.

he got up, walked over to her, and stood looking at the lights of the city below them, at the 
angular shapes of buildings, at the dark walls made translucent by the glow of the windows, as 
if the walls were only a checkered veil of thin black gauze over a solid mass of radiance. and 
ellsworth toohey said softly:

"look at it. a sublime achievement, isn't it? a heroic achievement. think of the thousands who 
worked to create this and of the millions who profit by it. and it is said that but for the spirit of a 
dozen men, here and there down the ages, but for a dozen men--less, perhaps--none of this 
would have been possible. and that might be true. if so, there are--again--two possible 
attitudes to take. we can say that these twelve were great benefactors, that we are all fed by

austen heller, who had been her friend, spoke to her about it. he was angrier than she had 
ever seen him; his face lost all the charm of his usual sarcastic poise.

"what in hell do you think you're doing, dominique?" he snapped. "this is the greatest 
exhibition of journalistic hooliganism i've ever seen swilled out in public print. why don't you 
leave that sort of thing to ellsworth toohey?"

"ellsworth is good, isn't he?" she said.

"at least, he's had the decency to keep his unsanitary trap shut about roark--though, of 

course, that too is an indecency. but what's happened to you? do you realize who and what 
you're talking about? it was all right when you amused yourself by praising some horrible 
abortion of grandpaw holcombe's or panning the pants off your own father and that pretty

"someone else?"

"you know that i got it, from that first article of yours about the enright house. you wanted me 
to get it. but don't you think someone else might understand your way of doing things?"

"oh yes. but the effect--for you--will be worse than if they didn't. they'll like you the less for it. 
however, i don't know who'll even bother to understand. unless it's...roark, what do you think 
of ellsworth toohey?"

"good god, why should anyone think of ellsworth toohey?"

she liked the rare occasions when she met roark at some gathering where heller or enright 

had brought him. she liked the polite, impersonal "miss francon" pronounced by his voice. 
she enjoyed the nervous concern of the hostess and her efforts not to let them come 
together. she knew that the people around them expected some explosion, some shocking 
sign of hostility which never came. she did not seek roark out and she did not avo

restaurants made famous by toohey's patronage. "at least, no one will recognize us here and 
bother us."

he sent a jet of smoke from his egyptian cigarette at a faded coca-cola sign over their booth, 
he ordered a sandwich, he nibbled daintily a slice of pickle which was not flyspecked but 
looked it, and he talked to keating. he talked at random. what he said did not matter, at first; 
it was his voice, the matchless voice of ellsworth toohey. keating felt as if he were standing in 
the middle of a vast plain, under the stars, held and owned, in assurance, in security.

the only one. that is why i had to pan that new play, in my column yesterday. that play lacked

sneak or hide, but committed his act openly, with systematic deliberation: he walked to the 
tap, turned it on, stood in the middle of the lawn and directed the hose at johnny, his aim 
faultless--with johnny's mother just a few steps behind him down the street, with his own 
mother and father and the visiting minister in full view on the toohey porch. johnny stokes 
was a bright kid with dimples and golden curls; people always turned to look at johnny 
stokes. nobody had ever turned to look at ellsworth toohey.

the shock and amazement of the grownups present were such that nobody rushed to stop 
ellsworth for a long moment. he stood, bracing his thin little body against the violence of the 
nozzle jerking in his hands, never allowing it to leave its objective until he felt satisfied; then he 
let it drop, the water hissing through the grass, and made two steps toward the porch, and 
stopped, waiting, his head high, delivering himself for punishment. the punishment would

he had no close personal friends. he was considered impartial and incorruptible. there were 
two incidents in his childhood of which his mother was very proud.

it happened that the wealthy, popular willie lovett gave a birthday party on the same day as 
drippy munn, son of a widowed seamstress, a whining boy whose nose was always running. 
nobody accepted drippy's invitation, except the children who were never invited anywhere. of 
those asked for both occasions, ellsworth toohey was the only one who snubbed willie lovett 
and went to drippy munn's party, a miserable affair from which he expected and received no 
pleasure. willie lovett's enemies howled and taunted willie for months afterward--about being 
passed up in favor of drippy munn.

it happened that pat noonan offered ellsworth a bag of jelly beans in exchange for a 
surreptitious peek at his test paper. ellsworth took the jelly beans and allowed pat to copy his 
test. a week later, ellsworth marched up to the

boy was one of the best students, and he could not sacrifice the boy's record to the demands

the teacher had to drop the matter and let the test marks remain as they were. but it threw 
suspicion on the grades of johnny stokes, pat noonan, and all the best pupils of the class, 
except ellsworth toohey.

ellsworth was eleven years old when his mother died. aunt adeline, his father's maiden sister, 
came to live with them and run the toohey household. aunt adeline was a tall, capable 
woman to whom the word "horse" clung in conjunction with the words "sense" and "face." the 
secret sorrow of her life was that she had never inspired romance. helen became her 
immediate favorite. she considered ellsworth an imp out of hell. but ellsworth never wavered

to a rapt audience, at bull sessions lasting till dawn, that religion bred selfishness; because, he 
stated, religion overemphasized the importance of the individual spirit; religion preached 
nothing but a single concern--the salvation of one's own soul.

"to achieve virtue in the absolute sense," said ellsworth toohey, "a man must be willing to 
take the foulest crimes upon his soul--for the sake of his brothers. to mortify the flesh is 
nothing. to mortify the soul is the only act of virtue. so you think you love the broad mass of

he did not have much success among the poor boys working their way through college. he 
acquired a sizable following among the young heirs, the second and third generation 
millionaires. he offered them an achievement of which they felt capable.

he graduated with high honors. when he came to new york, he was preceded by a small, 
private fame; a few trickles of rumor had seeped down from harvard about an unusual person 
named ellsworth toohey; a few people, among the extreme intellectuals and the extremely 
wealthy, heard these rumors and promptly forgot what they heard, but remembered the name; 
it remained in their minds with a vague connotation of such things as brilliance, courage, 
idealism.

people began to ooze toward ellsworth toohey; the right kind of people, those who soon 
found him to be a spiritual necessity. the other kind did not come; there seemed to be an 
instinct about it. when someone commented on the loyalty of

charming little pushover, good for a few drunken parties--"let us be modern"; and renunciation,
if it concerned a deep, emotional passion--"let us be grownup." when a boy came to confess 
a feeling of shame after some unsavory sexual experience, toohey told him to snap out of it: 

"it was damn good for you. there are two things we must get rid of early in life: a feeling of 
personal superiority and an exaggerated reverence for the sexual act."

people noticed that ellsworth toohey seldom let a boy pursue the career he had chosen. "no, 
i wouldn't go in for law if i were you. you're much too tense and passionate about it. a 
hysterical devotion to one's career does not make for happiness or success. it is wiser to 
select a profession about which you can be calm, sane and matter-of-fact. yes, even if you 
hate it. it makes for down-to-earthness."..."no, i wouldn't advise you to continue with your

after leaving college some of his protégés did quite well, others failed. only one committed 
suicide. it was said that ellsworth toohey had exercised a beneficent influence upon them--for 
they never forgot him: they came to consult him on many things, years later, they wrote him, 
they clung to him. they were like machines without a self-starter, that had to be cranked up by 
an outside hand. he was never too busy to give them his full attention.

his life was crowded, public and impersonal as a city square. the friend of humanity had no 
single private friend. people came to him; he came close to no one. he accepted all. his

ach busy day of his life like a small, neat coin dropped patiently into a 
gigantic slot machine, without a glance at the combination of symbols, without return. 
gradually, one of his many activities began to stand out among the others: he became known 
as an eminent critic of architecture. he wrote about buildings for three successive magazines 
that limped on noisily for a few years and failed, one after the other: new voices, new 
pathways, new horizons. the fourth, new frontiers, survived. ellsworth toohey was the only 
thing salvaged from the successive wrecks. architectural criticism seemed to be a neglected 
field of endeavor; few people bothered to write about buildings, fewer to read. toohey 
acquired a reputation and an unofficial monopoly. the better magazines began calling upon 
him whenever they needed anything connected with architecture.

in the year 1921 a small change occurred in toohey's private life; his niece catherine halsey, 
the daughter of his sister helen, came to live with h

those rare moments when the humblest person knows suddenly what it means to feel as the 
center of the universe, and is made beautiful by the knowledge, and the world--in the eyes of 
witnesses--looks like a better place for having such a center. ellsworth toohey saw this--and 
decided that catherine would remain with him.

in the year 1925 came sermons in stone--and fame.

ellsworth toohey became a fashion. intellectual hostesses fought over him. some people 
disliked him and laughed at him. but there was little satisfaction in laughing at ellsworth

ction, nevertheless: toward the inconsistent, the irresponsible, 
the trite and the maudlin. the wynand papers stood against privilege and for the common 
man, but in a respectable manner that could shock nobody; they exposed monopolies, when 
they wished; they supported strikes, when they wished, and vice versa. they denounced wall 
street and they denounced socialism and they hollered for clean movies, all with the same 
gusto. they were strident and blatant--and, in essence, lifelessly mild. ellsworth toohey was a 
phenomenon much too extreme to fit behind the front page of the banner.

but the staff of the banner was as unfastidious as its policy. it included everybody who could 
please the public or any large section thereof. it was said: "gail wynand is not a pig. he'll eat 
anything." ellsworth toohey was a great success and the public was suddenly interested in 
architecture; the banner had no authority on architecture; the banner would get ellsworth 
toohey. it was a simple syllogism.

architecture. he will help you to understand everything you want to know about the wonders of 
modern building. watch for 'one small voice' on monday. to appear exclusively in the

ellsworth toohey made no announcement or explanation to anyone. he disregarded the 
friends who cried that he had sold himself. he simply went to work. he devoted "one small 
voice" to architecture--once a month. the rest of the time it was the voice of ellsworth toohey 
saying what he wished said--to syndicated millions.

he pleased. he had insisted upon it. it was considered a great victory, by everybody except

"genius is an exaggeration of dimension. so is elephantiasis. both may be only a disease."

"we are all brothers under the skin--and i, for one, would be willing to skin humanity to prove

in the offices of the banner ellsworth toohey was treated respectfully and left alone. it was 
whispered that gail wynand did not like him--because wynand was always polite to him. 
alvah scarret unbent to the point of cordiality, but kept a wary distance. there was a silent, 
watchful equilibrium between toohey and scarret: they understood each other.

toohey made no attempt to approach wynand in any way. toohey seemed indifferent to all 
the men who counted on the banner. he concentrated on the others, instead.

he organized a club of wy

nand employees. it was not a labor union; it was just a club. it met 
once a month in the library of the banner. it did not concern itself with wages, hours or 
working conditions; it had no concrete program at all. people got acquainted, talked, and 
listened to speeches. ellsworth toohey made most of the speeches. he spoke about new 
horizons and the press as the voice of the masses. gail wynand appeared at a meeting once, 
entering unexpectedly in the middle of a session. toohey smiled and invited him to join the 
club, declaring that he was eligible. wynand did not join. he sat listening for half an hour, 
yawned, got up, and left before the meeting was over.

aged lady who drew subconsciously, claiming that she never looked at her hand and had no 
idea of what the hand was doing; her hand, she said, was guided by the spirit of the departed 
lover whom she had never met on earth. here they did not talk so much about the proletariat, 
but merely rebelled against the tyranny of reality and of the objective.

a few friends pointed out to ellsworth toohey that he seemed guilty of inconsistency; he was 
so deeply opposed to individualism, they said, and here were all these writers and artists of 
his, and every one of them was a rabid individualist. "do you really think so?" said toohey, 
smiling blandly.

nobody took these councils seriously. people talked about them, because they thought it 
made good conversation; it was such a huge joke, they said, certainly there was no harm in 
any of it. "do you really think so?" said toohey.

people admired his sense of humor. he was, they said, a man who could laugh at himself. 
"i'm a dangerous person. somebody ought to warn you against me," he said to people, in the 
tone of uttering the most preposterous thing in the world.

of all the many titles bestowed upon him, he preferred one: ellsworth toohey, the

story concerned roger enright and because roger enright did not want to have them there. 
he ignored them. he stood in the middle of the street, looking

was preposterous, exhibitionist and phony. they said: "my dear, imagine inviting mrs. 
moreland if you lived in a place like that! and her home is in such good taste!" a few were 
beginning to appear who said: "you know, i rather like modern architecture, there are some 
mighty interesting things being done that way nowadays, there's quite a school of it in 
germany that's rather remarkable--but this is not like it at all. this is a freak."

ellsworth toohey never mentioned the enright house in his column. a reader of the banner 
wrote to him: "dear mr. toohey: what do you think of this place they call the enright house? i 
have a friend who is an interior decorator and he talks a lot about it and he says it's lousy. 
architecture and such various arts being my hobby, i don't know what to think. will you tell us

and unicorn. i'd choose three gilded balls."

and as roark looked at him, he added: "don't worry. they're all against me. but i have one 
advantage: they don't know what they want. i do."

ellsworth toohey sat in his office, looking at a newspaper spread out on his desk, at the item 
announcing the aquitania contract. he smoked, holding a cigarette propped in the corner of 
his mouth, supported by two straight fingers; one finger tapped against the cigarette, slowly, 
rhythmically, for a long time.

he heard the sound of his door thrown open, and he glanced up to see dominique standing 
there, leaning against the doorjamb, her arms crossed on her chest. her face looked 
interested, nothing more,

complete success. so we shall just write the aquitania off as a major defeat, forget all about it 
and continue as we were."

"certainly, ellsworth. just as we were. i'm cinching a beautiful new hospital for peter keating 
at a dinner party tonight."

ellsworth toohey went home and spent the evening thinking about hopton stoddard.

hopton stoddard was a little man worth twenty million dollars. three inheritances had 
contributed to that sum, and seventy-two years of a busy life devoted to the purpose of making
money. hopton stoddard had a genius for investment; he invested in everything--houses of ill 
fame, broadway spectacles on the grand scale, preferably of a religious nature, factories, 
farm mortgages and contraceptives. he was small and bent. his fac

se it had a single expression: he smiled. his little mouth 
was shaped like a v in eternal good cheer; his eyebrows were tiny v's inverted over round, 
blue eyes; his hair, rich, white and waved, looked like a wig, but was real.

toohey had known hopton stoddard for many years and exercised a strong influence upon 
him. hopton stoddard had never married, had no relatives and no friends; he distrusted 
people, believing that they were always after his money. but he felt a tremendous respect for 
ellsworth toohey, because toohey represented the exact opposite of his own life; toohey 
had no concern whatever for worldly wealth; by the mere fact of this contrast, he considered 
toohey the personification of virtue; what this estimate implied in regard to his own life never 
quite occurred to him. he was not easy in his mind about his life, and the uneasiness grew 
with the years, with the certainty of an approaching end. he found relief in religion--in the form 
of a bribe. he experimented with several di

 expected to regard god 
in heaven.

but this summer toohey met defeat with hopton stoddard for the first time.

hopton stoddard decided to realize a dream which he had been planning slyly and cautiously, 
like all his other investments, for several years: he decided to build a temple. it was not to be 
the temple of any particular creed, but an interdenominational, non-sectarian monument to 
religion, a cathedral of faith, open to all. hopton stoddard wanted to play safe.

he felt crushed when ellsworth toohey advised him against the project. toohey wanted a 
building to house a new home for subnormal children; he had an organization set up, a 
distinguished committee of sponsors, an endowment for operating expenses--but no building 
and no funds to erect one. if hopton stoddard wished a worthy memorial to his name, a grand 
climax of his generosity, to what nobler purpose could he dedicate his money than to the 
hopton stoddard home for subnormal children, toohey pointed out to him emphatically; to

i was wrong. you were right about that temple."

"no!" said hopton stoddard, aghast.

"yes," said toohey, "you were right. nothing else would be quite fitting. you must build a 
temple. a temple of the human spirit."

hopton stoddard swallowed, and his blue eyes became moist. he felt that he must have 
progressed far upon the path of righteousness if he had been able to teach a point of virtue to 
his teacher. after that, nothing else mattered; he sat, like a meek, wrinkled baby, listening to 
ellsworth toohey, nodding, agreeing to everything.

"it's an ambitious undertaking, hopton, and if you do it, you must do it right. it's a little 
presumptuous, you know--offering a present to god--and unless you do it in the best way 
possible, it will be offensive, not reverent."

"yes, of course. it must be right. it must be right. it must be the best. you'll help me, won't you,
ellsworth? you know all about buildings and art and everything--it must be right."

"i'll be glad to help you, if you really want m

"first of all, the architect. that's very important."

"yes, indeed."

"you don't want one of those satin-lined commercial boys with the dollar sign all over them. 
you want a man who believes in his work as--as you believe in god."

"that's right. that's absolutely right."

"you must take the one i name."

"certainly. who's that?"

"howard roark."

"huh?" hopton stoddard looked blank. "who's he?"

"he's the man who's going to build the temple of the human spirit."

"is he any good?"

ellsworth toohey turned and looked straight into his eyes.

"by my immortal soul, hopton," he said slowly, "he's the best there is."

"oh!..."

"but he's difficult to get. he doesn't work except on certain conditions. you must observe them 
scrupulously. you must give him complete freedom. tell him what you want and how much 
you want to spend, and leave the rest up to him. let him design it and build it as he wishes. 
he won't work otherwise. just tell him frankly that you know nothing about architecture and

i should be happy, peter keating told himself--and wasn't. he watched from a window the 
solid spread of faces filling broadway from curb to curb. he tried to talk himself into joy. he felt 
nothing. he had to admit that he was bored. but he smiled and shook hands and let himself

white bromide.

after the ceremonies ellsworth toohey took keating away to the retreat of a pale-orchid booth 
in a quiet, expensive restaurant. many brilliant parties were being given in honor of the 
opening, but keating grasped toohey's offer and declined all the other invitations. toohey 

watched him as he seized his drink and slumped in his seat.

"wasn't it grand?" said toohey. 'that, peter, is the climax of what you can expect from life." 
he lifted his glass delicately. "here's to the hope that you shall have many triumphs such as 
this.

at the beginning of january, while the first steel columns rose from the excavations that were 
to become the cord building and the aquitania hotel, roark worked on the drawings for the 
temple.

when the first sketches were finished, he said to his secretary:

"get me steve mallory."

"mallory, mr. roark? who...oh, yes, the shooting sculptor."

"the what?"

"he took a shot at ellsworth toohey, didn't he?"

"did he? yes, that's right."

"is that the one you want, mr. roark?"

"that's the one."

for two days the secretary telephoned art dealers, galleries, architects, newspapers. no one 
could tell her what had become of steven mallory or where he could be found. on the third 
day she reported to roark: "i've found an address, in the village, which i'm told might be his. 
there's no telephone." roark dictated a letter asking mallory to telephone his office.

the letter was not returne

she looked interested: "why?"

"i don't know."

her glance of curious study worried him.

"maybe," he muttered, "maybe it's because it has never seemed right that you should have 
such contempt for his work. it made me very happy that you had, but...but it never seemed 
right--for you."

"it didn't, peter?"

"no. but you don't like him as a person, do you?"

"no, i don't like him as a person."

ellsworth toohey was displeased. "it was most unwise of you, dominique," he said in the 
privacy of her office. his voice did not sound smooth.

"i know it was."

"can't you change your mind and refuse?"

"i won't change my mind, ellsworth."

he sat down, and shrugged; after a while he smiled. "all right, my dear, have it your own way."

she ran a pencil through a line of copy and said nothing.

toohey lighted a cigarette. "so he's chosen steven mallory for the job," he said.

"i'll straighten it out, if i have to murder a few of them," kent lansing told roark. "i'll get it out

won't tell you to be patient. men like you and me would not survive beyond their first fifteen

ellsworth toohey laughed, sitting on the edge of dominique's desk. "the unfinished 
symphony--thank god," he said.

dominique used that in her column. "the unfinished symphony on central park south," she 
wrote. she did not say, "thank god." the nickname was repeated. strangers noticed the odd 
sight of an expensive structure on an important street, left gaping with empty windows, half-
covered walls, naked beams; when they asked what it was, people who had never heard of

12.

the opening of the stoddard temple was announced for the afternoon of november first.

the press agent had done a good job. people talked about the event, about howard roark, 
about the architectural masterpiece which the city was to expect.

on the morning of october 31 hopton stoddard returned from his journey around the world. 
ellsworth toohey met him at the pier.

on the morning of november 1 hopton stoddard issued a brief statement announcing that 
there would be no opening. no explanation was given.

on the morning of november 2 the new york banner came out with the column "one small 
voice" by ellsworth m. toohey subtitled "sacrilege." it read as follows:

ade hopton stoddard. he had returned from his journey, crushed by 
the universal spectacle of religion, most particularly by the various forms in which the promise 
of hell confronted him all over the earth. he had been driven to the conclusion that his life 
qualified him for the worst possible hereafter under any system of faith. it had shaken what 
remained of his mind. the ship stewards, on his return trip, had felt certain that the old 
gentleman was senile.

on the afternoon of his return ellsworth toohey took him to see the temple. toohey said 
nothing. hopton stoddard stared, and toohey heard stoddard's false teeth clicking 
spasmodically. the place did not resemble anything stoddard had seen anywhere in the 
world; nor anything he had expected. he did not know what to think. when he turned a glance 
of desperate appeal upon toohey, stoddard's eyes looked like jell-o. he waited. in that 
moment, toohey could have convinced him of anything. toohey spoke and said what he said 
later in his colum

r to reveal 
who advised you to hire roark."

on the following day "sacrilege" appeared in the banner and set the fuse. the announcement 
of stoddard's suit lighted it.

nobody would have felt an urge to crusade about a building; but religion had been attacked; 
the press agent had prepared the ground too well, the spring of public attention was wound, a 
great many people could make use of it.

the clamor of indignation that rose against howard roark and his temple astonished 
everyone, except ellsworth toohey. ministers damned the building in sermons. women's 
clubs passed resolutions of protest. a committee of mothers made page eight of the 
newspapers, with a petition that shrieked something about the protection of their children. a 
famous actress wrote an article on the essential unity of all the arts, explained that the 
stoddard temple had no sense of structural diction, and spoke of the time when she had 
played mary magdalene in a great biblical drama. a society woman wrote an article on the

didn't you?"

hopton stoddard received so many letters of sympathy that he began to feel quite happy. he 
had never been popular before. ellsworth, he thought, was right; his brother men were 
forgiving him; ellsworth was always right.

the better newspapers dropped the story after a while. but the banner kept it going. it had 
been a boon to the banner. gail wynand was away, sailing his yacht through the indian 
ocean, and alvah scarret was stuck for a crusade. this suited him. ellsworth toohey needed 
to make no suggestions; scarret rose to the occasion all by himself.

he wrote about the decline of civilization and deplored the loss of the simple faith. he 
sponsored an essay contest for high-school students on "why i go to church." he ran a 
series of illustrated articles on "the churches of our childhood." he ran photographs of 
religious sculpture through the ages--the sphinx, gargoyles, totem poles--and gave great 
prominence to pictures of dominique's statue, with proper captio

ns of indignation, but omitting 
the model's name. he ran cartoons of roark as a barbarian with bearskin and club. he wrote 
many clever things about the tower of babel that could not reach heaven and about icarus 
who flopped on his wax wings.

ellsworth toohey sat back and watched. he made two minor suggestions: he found, in the 
banner's morgue, the photograph of roark at the opening of the enright house, the 
photograph of a man's face in a moment of exaltation, and he had it printed in the banner, 
over the caption: "are you happy, mr. superman?" he made stoddard open the temple to the 
public while awaiting the trial of his suit. the temple attracted crowds of people who left 
obscene drawings and inscriptions on the pedestal of dominique's statu

make it easier for you," roark said to him one evening.

"there's nothing to talk about," mallory answered indifferently. "i told you i didn't think they'd 
let you survive."

"rubbish. you have no right to be afraid for me."

"i'm not afraid for you. what would be the use? it's something else."

days later, sitting on the window sill in roark's room, looking out at the street, mallory said 
suddenly:

"howard, do you remember what i told you about the beast i'm afraid of? i know nothing about 
ellsworth toohey. i had never seen him before i shot at him. i had only read what he writes. 
howard, i shot at him because i think he knows everything about that beast."

dominique came to roark's room on the evening when stoddard announced his lawsuit. she 
said nothing. she put her bag down on a table and stood removing her gloves, slowly, as if 
she wished to prolong the intimacy of performing a routine gesture here, in his room; she 
looked down at her fingers. then she raised her head. her face looked as

n denial of our entire past, an insolent 
'no' flung in the face of history. i may venture a guess as to the reason why this case has 
aroused such public interest. all of us have recognized instinctively that it involves a moral 
issue much beyond its legal aspects. this building is a monument to a profound hatred of 
humanity. it is one man's ego defying the most sacred impulses of all mankind, of every man 
on the street, of every man in this courtroom!"

this was not a witness in court, but ellsworth toohey addressing a meeting--and the reaction 
was inevitable: the audience burst into applause. the judge struck his gavel and made a 
threat to have the courtroom cleared. order was restored, but not to the faces of the crowd: 
the faces remained lecherously self-righteous. it was pleasant to be singled out and brought 
into the case as an injured party. three-fourths of them had never seen the stoddard temple.

"thank you, mr. toohey," said the attorney, faintly suggesting a bow. then he turned to

roark 
and said with delicate courtesy: "your witness."

"no questions," said roark.

ellsworth toohey raised one eyebrow and left the stand regretfully.

"mr. peter keating!" called the attorney. peter keating's face looked attractive and fresh, as if 
he had had a good night's sleep. he mounted the witness stand with a collegiate sort of gusto, 
swinging his shoulders and arms unnecessarily. he took the oath and answered the first 
questions gaily. his pose in the witness chair was strange: his torso slumped to one side with 
swaggering ease, an elbow on the chair's arm; but his feet were plan

lled his last witness.

"miss dominique francon," he announced solemnly.

mallory gasped, but no one heard it; mike's hand clamped down on his wrist and made him 
keep still.

the attorney had reserved dominique for his climax, partly because he expected a great deal 
from her, and partly because he was worried; she was the only unrehearsed witness; she had 
refused to be coached. she had never mentioned the stoddard temple in her column; but he 
had looked up her earlier writings on roark; and ellsworth toohey had advised him to call her.

dominique stood for a moment on the elevation of the witness stand, looking slowly over the 
crowd. her beauty was startling but too impersonal, as if it did not belong to her; it seemed 
present in the room as a separate entity. people thought of a vision that had not quite 
appeared, of a victim on a scaffold, of a person standing at night at the rail of an ocean liner.

"what is your name?"

"dominique francon."

"and your occupation, miss francon?"

consciousness of being guiltless, of seeing the truth and achieving it, of living up to one's 
highest possibility, of knowing no shame and having no cause for shame, of being able to 
stand naked in full sunlight. he thought that exaltation means joy and that joy is man's 
birthright. he thought that a place built as a setting for man is a sacred place. that is what 
howard roark thought of man and of exaltation. but ellsworth toohey said that this temple 
was a monument to a profound hatred of humanity. ellsworth toohey said that the essence of 
exaltation was to be scared out of your wits, to fall down and to grovel. ellsworth toohey said 

that man's highest act was to realize his own worthlessness and to beg forgiveness. ellsworth

forgiven. ellsworth toohey saw that this building was of man and of the earth--and ellsworth

"miss francon, we are not really discussing mr. toohey, so if you will confine yourself to..."

"i do not condemn ellsworth toohey. i condemn howard roark. a building, they say, must be

"your honor, i don't see what possible bearing this can have on..."

"i am proving your case for you. i am proving why you must go with ellsworth toohey, as you 
will anyway. the stoddard temple must be destroyed. not to save men from it, but to save it

"your witness," the attorney snapped to roark.

"no questions," said roark.

dominique left the stand.

the attorney bowed to the bench and said: "the plaintiff rests."

the judge turned to roark and made a vague gesture, inviting him to proceed.

roark got up and walked to the bench, the brown envelope in hand. he took out of the 
envelope ten photographs of the stoddard temple and laid them on the judge's desk. he said:

"the defense rests."

13.

hopton stoddard won the suit.

ellsworth toohey wrote in his column: "mr. roark pulled a phryne in court and didn't get away 
with it. we never believed that story in the first place."

roark was instructed to pay the costs of the temple's alterations. he said that he would not 
appeal the case. hopton stoddard announced that the temple would be remodeled into the 
hopton stoddard home for subnormal children.

on the day after the end of the trial alvah scarret gasped when he glanced at the proofs of 
"your house" delivered to his desk: the

on an evening three days after the trial ellsworth toohey sat in his room, listening to the 
radio. he did not feel like working and he allowed himself a rest, relaxing luxuriously in an 
armchair, letting his fingers follow the rhythm of a complicated symphony. he heard a knock 
at his door. "co-ome in," he drawled.

catherine came in. she glanced at the radio by way of apology for her entrance.

"i knew you weren't working, uncle ellsworth. i want to speak to you."

she stood slumped, her body thin and curveless. she wore a skirt of expensive tweed,

"yes, peter."

after he had gone, she lay on her bed, sobbing aloud, without restraint, without dignity, without 
a care in the world.

ellsworth toohey had left the door of his study open. he had seen keating pass by the door 
without noticing it and go out. then he heard the sound of catherine's sobs. he walked to her 
room and entered without knocking. he asked:

"what's the matter, my dear? has peter done something to hurt you?"

she half lifted herself on the bed, she looked at him, throwing her hair back off her face, 
sobbing exultantly. she said without thinking the first thing she felt like saying. she said

american builders.

the council of american builders had grown. after the stoddard trial many earnest 
discussions were held informally in the club rooms of the a.g.a. the attitude of the a.g.a. 
toward ellsworth toohey had not been cordial, particularly since the establishment of his 
council. but the trial brought a subtle change; many members pointed out that the article in 

"one small voice" had actually brought about the stoddard lawsuit; and that a man who could 
force clients to sue was a man to be treated with caution. so it was suggested that ellsworth 
toohey should be invited to address the a.g.a. at one of its luncheons. some members 
objected, guy francon among them. the most passionate objector

over them, that was the time to fight such a person. the majority overruled him. ellsworth

made a witty, gracious speech. many members of the a.g.a. joined the council of american

always present to show them through the home. the inspection made the mink coats seem

altruistic virtue together, in a demonstration more potent than a visit to a morgue. on the way

roark's office had shrunk back to one room. after the completion of the cord building he 
found no work. the depression had wrecked the building trade; there was little work for 
anyone; it was said that the skyscraper was finished; architects were closing their offices.

a few commissions still dribbled out occasionally, and a group of architects hovered about 
them with the dignity of a bread line. there were men like ralston holcombe among them,

dard temple. on an evening in november he 
went to see it. he did not know whether it was surrender to pain or victory over the fear of 
seeing it.

it was late and the garden of the stoddard home was deserted. the building was dark, a 
single light showed in a back window upstairs. roark stood looking at the building for a long 
time.

the door under the greek portico opened and a slight masculine figure came out. it hurried 
casually down the steps--and then stopped.

"hello, mr. roark," said ellsworth toohey quietly.

roark looked at him without curiosity. "hello," said roark.

"please don't run away." the voice was not mocking, but earnest.

"i wasn't going to."

"i think i knew that you'd come here some day and i think i wanted to be here when you came. 
i've kept inventing excuses for myself to hang about this place." there was no gloating in the 
voice; it sounded drained and simple.

"well?"

"did anyone consult you about this plugging?"

"no. i tell you, nobody's behind it. it's just spontaneous. just a lot of people who thought it was

"who was the first one that you heard it from?"

"i don't know....let me see....it was...yes, i think it was ellsworth toohey."

at two o'clock wynand arrived, as guest of honor, at a luncheon given by a national 
convention of women's clubs. he sat at the right of the chairwoman in an echoing banquet 
hall filled with the odors of corsages--gardenias and sweet peas--and of fried chicken. after

"i shall rest upon your opinion of my present tonight."

toohey bowed and turned to go. he was at the door when wynand added:

"you know, toohey, one of these days you'll bore me."

"i shall endeavor not to do so until the right time," said toohey, bowed again and went out.

when wynand returned to his home, he had forgotten all about ellsworth toohey.

that evening, in his penthouse, wynand had dinner with a woman who had a white face, soft 
brown hair and, behind her, three centuries of fathers and brothers who would have killed a 
man for a hint of the things which gail wynand had experienced with her.

the line of her arm, when she raised a crystal goblet of water to her lips, was as perfect as the 
lines of the silver candelabra produced by a matchless talent--and wynand observed it with 
the same appreciation. the candlelight flickerin

"but what do you call a healthy tree?"

"they don't exist, alvah," said wynand cheerfully, "they don't exist."

alvah scarret never asked wynand for an explanation of this new pursuit. by some dim 
instinct scarret guessed a little of the reason behind it. scarret shrugged and laughed, telling 
people that it was nothing to worry about, it was just "a safety valve." only two men 
understood gail wynand: alvah scarret--partially; ellsworth toohey--completely.

ellsworth toohey--who wished, above all, to avoid a quarrel with wynand at that time--could 
not refrain from a feeling of resentment, because wynand had not chosen him as a victim. he 
almost wished wynand would try to corrupt him, no matter what the consequences. but 
wynand seldom noticed his existence.

"would you rather i put it in a more involved way--as i did about vincent knowlton?"

she asked, in the same level monotone: "whose opinion, peter? gordon prescott's? ralston

he turned to her, leaning on the arm of his chair, half rising, suddenly tense. the thing 
between them was beginning to take shape. he had a first hint of words that would name it.

"dominique," he said softly, reasonably, "that's it. now i know. i know what's been the matter 
all the time."

"has anything been the matter?"

"wait. this is terribly important. dominique, you've never said, not once, what you thought.

he had felt that there was some story behind the statue and he became certain of it now, by

self-control.

"where and when did you see that statue, mr. wynand?"

he lost the triumph; it was not a thing which a woman intent on stoneridge should have said

he looked at her. he said: "you're interesting."

"that's your third mistake."

"the first was about mr. toohey. in the circumstances, one would expect you to praise him to 
me. to quote him. to lean on his great prestige in matters of architecture."

"but one would expect you to know ellsworth toohey. that should disqualify any quotations."

"i intended to say that to you--had you given me the chance you won't give me."

"that should make it more entertaining."

"you expected to be entertained?"

"i am."

"about the statue?" it was the only point of weakness he had discovered.

"no." her voice was hard. "not about the statue."

"tell me, when was it made and for whom?"

"is that another thing mr. toohey forgot?"

"apparently."

"no. i didn't then. i don't dare to now "

"why?"

he ignored the question. he said, smiling: "and so, you came to me and said 'you're the vilest 
person on earth--take me so that i'll learn self-contempt. i lack that which most people live by. 
they find life endurable, while i can't.' do you see now what you've shown?"

"i didn't expect it to be seen."

"no. not by the publisher of the new york banner, of course. that's all right. i expected a 
beautiful slut who was a friend of ellsworth toohey."

they laughed together. she thought it was strange that they could talk without strain--as if he 
had forgotten the purpose of this journey. his calm had become a contagious sense of peace 
between them.

shrugged and turned his back. the sight of dumont made him sick today.

he left the office early. a vague instinct kept pulling at him, like hunger, at first, then taking 
shape. he had to see ellsworth toohey. he had to reach toohey. he felt like the survivor of a 
shipwreck swimming toward a distant light.

that evening he dragged himself to ellsworth toohey's apartment. when he entered, he felt 
dimly glad of his self-control, because toohey seemed to notice nothing in his face.

ellsworth toohey came out in support of the cause of modern architecture.

in the past ten years, while most of the new residences continued to be built as faithful 
historical copies, the principles of henry cameron had won the field of commercial structures: 
the factories, the office buildings, the skyscrapers. it was a pale, distorted victory; a reluctant 
compromise that consisted of omitting columns and pediments, allowing a few stretches of 
wall to remain naked, apologizing for a shape--good through acc

had been safe in copying the parthenon, saw the danger and found a way to security: to walk 
cameron's path and make it lead them to a new parthenon, an easier parthenon in the shape 
of a packing crate of glass and concrete. the palm tree had broken through; the fungus came 
to feed on it, to deform it, to hide it, to pull it back into the common jungle.

the jungle found its words.

in "one small voice," subtitled "i swim with the current," ellsworth toohey wrote:

him; roark was working and no interruptions were allowed. but mallory shoved her aside and 
tore into the office, slamming the door behind. she noticed that he held a newspaper in his 
hand.

roark glanced up at him, from the drafting table, and dropped his pencil. he knew that this 
was the way mallory's face had looked when he shot at ellsworth toohey.

"well, howard? do you want to know why you got monadnock valley?"

he threw the newspaper down on the table. roark saw the heading of a story on the third

"they sold two hundred percent of it."

is great, and the man--almost rarer--who is great enough to see greatness and say so."

ellsworth toohey wrote: "the paradox in all this preposterous noise is the fact that mr. caleb

were unimpeachable. he exhibited sounder judgment in matters of architectural merit than mr.

"i don't work with collectives. i don't consult, i don't cooperate, i don't collaborate."

there was a great deal of angry comment on roark's refusal, in architectural circles. people 
said: "the conceited bastard!" the indignation was too sharp and raw for a mere piece of 
professional gossip; each man took it as a personal insult; each felt himself qualified to alter, 
advise and improve the work of any man living.

"the incident illustrates to perfection," wrote ellsworth toohey, "the antisocial nature of mr. 
howard roark's egotism, the arrogance of the unbridled individualism which he has always 
personified."

among the eight chosen to design "the march of the centuries" were peter keating, gordon

he pressed the button and said to his secretary:

"no, but this is interesting, ellsworth. really, it's interesting. i know you'll want to know."

of emphasized patience:

when ellsworth toohey entered wynand's office, as summoned, he made a few steps, then 
stopped. the walls of wynand's office--the only luxurious room in the banner building--were 
made of cork and copper paneling and had never borne any pictures. now, on the wall facing 
wynand's desk, he saw an enlarged photograph under glass: the picture of roark at the 
opening of the enright house; roark standing at the parapet of the river, his head thrown 
back.

solemnity of looking at the sky comes, not from what one contemplates, but from that uplift of

"the basic trouble with the modern world," said ellsworth toohey, "is the intellectual fallacy 
that freedom and compulsion are opposites. to solve the gigantic problems crushing the 
world today, we must clarify our mental confusion. we must acquire a philosophical

anything anywhere until every inhabitant of the globe has a roof over his head...well, what 
about the patagonians? it's our job to teach them to want a roof. prescott calls it dialectic

famous name he heard was a key of its keyboard, each controlling a special field, each hitting, 
leaving its mark, and the whole making connected sentences on a vast blank sheet. a 
typewriter, he thought, presupposes the hand that punches its keys.

society people said they liked an architect who was a liberal. the a.g.a. still existed, in stiff, 
hurt dignity, but people referred to it as the old folks' home. the council of american 
builders ruled the profession and talked about a closed shop, though no one had yet devised 
a way of achieving that. whenever an architect's name appeared in ellsworth toohey's 
column, it was always that of augustus webb. at thirty-nine, keating heard himself described 
as old-fashioned.

he had given up trying to understand. he knew dimly that the explanation of the change 
swallowing the world was of a nature he preferred not to know. in his youth he had felt an 
amicable contempt for the works of guy francon or ralston holcombe, and emulating them 
had seemed no more than innocent quackery. but he knew that gordon l. prescott and gus 
webb represented so imperti

him--and something tight, paralyzed, as sole means to express it. he went on. he tried. he 
looked at his canvases and knew that nothing was captured in their childish crudeness. it did 
not matter. no one was to see them. he stacked them carefully in a corner of the shack, and 
he locked the door before he returned to town. there was no pleasure in it, no pride, no 
solution; only--while he sat alone before the easel--a sense of peace.

he tried not to think of ellsworth toohey. a dim instinct told him that he could preserve a 
precarious security of spirit so long as he did not touch upon that subject. there could be but 
one explanation of toohey's behavior toward him--and he preferred not to formulate it.

toohey had drifted away from him. the intervals between their meetings had grown longer 
each year. he accepted it and told himself that toohey was busy. toohey's public silence 
about him was baffling. he told himself that toohey had more important things to wri

te about. 
toohey's criticism of "the march of the centuries" had been a blow. he told himself that his 
work had deserved it. he accepted any blame. he could afford to doubt himself. he could not 
afford to doubt ellsworth toohey.

it was neil dumont who forced him to think of toohey again. neil spoke petulantly about the 
state of the world, about crying over spilt milk, change as a law of existence, adaptability, and 
the importance of getting in on the ground floor. keating gathered, from a long, confused 
speech, that business, as they had known it, was finished, that government would take over 
whether they liked it or not, that the building trade was dying and the government would soon 
be the sole builder and the

now he had heard it pronounced. keating wondered why the name had sounded like the 
muffled stroke of a bell; as if the sound had opened and closed a sequence which he would 
not be able to stop.

"what do you mean, neil?"

"cortlandt homes. ellsworth toohey. now you know what i mean."

"neil, i..."

"what's the matter with you, pete? listen, everybody's laughing about it. everybody's saying 
that if they were toohey's special pet, like you are, they'd get cortlandt homes like that"--he 
snapped his manicured fingers--"just like that, and nobody can understand what you're waiting 
for. you know it's friend ellsworth who's running this particular housing show."

"whom are you kidding? most of the boys that count in every office are his boys. damned if i 
know how he got them in, but he did. what's the matter, pete? are you afraid of asking 
ellsworth toohey for a favor?"

this was it, thought keating; now there was no retreat. he could not admit to himself that he 
was afraid of asking ellsworth toohey.

"no," he said, his voice dull, "i'm not afraid, neil. i'll...all right, neil. i'll speak to ellsworth."

ellsworth toohey sat spread out on a couch, wearing a dressing gown. his body had the 
shape of a sloppy letter x-arms stretched over his head, along the edge of the back pillows, 
legs open in a wide fork. the dressing gown was made of silk, bearing the trademarked 
pattern of coty's face powder, white puffs on an orange background; it looked daring and gay, 
supremely elegant through sheer silliness. under the gown, toohey wore sleeping pyjamas of 
pistachio-green linen, crumpled. the trousers floated about t

"well, peter, that could be terrifying to contemplate. the inexplicable is always terrifying. but it 
wouldn't be so frightening if you stopped to ask yourself whether there's ever been any reason 
why you should have been at the top....oh, come, peter, smile, i'm only kidding. one loses 
everything when one loses one's sense of humor."

on the following morning keating came to his office after a visit to ellsworth toohey's 
cubbyhole in the banner building. he brought with him a briefcase containing the data on the 
cortlandt homes project. he spread the papers on a large table in his office and locked the 
door. he asked a draftsman to bring him a sandwich at noon, and he ordered another 
sandwich at dinner time. "want me to help, pete?" asked neil dumont. "we could consult and 
discuss it and..." keating shook his head.

he sat at his table all night. after a while he stopped looking at the papers; he sat sti

"yes....all right...."

keating rose and stood looking uncertainly at his briefcase for a moment, then picked it up. 
he mumbled some vague words of patting, he took his hat, he walked to the door, then 
stopped and looked down at his briefcase.

"howard...i brought something i wanted to show you."

he walked back into the room and put the briefcase on the table.

"i haven't shown it to anyone." his fingers fumbled, opening the straps. "not to mother or 
ellsworth toohey...i just want you to tell me if there's any..."

he handed to roark six of his canvases.

roark looked at them, one after another. he took a longer time than he needed. when he 
could trust himself to lift his eyes, he shook his head in silent answer to the word keating had 
not pronounced.

"it's too late, peter," he said gently.

keating nodded. "guess i...knew that."

when keating had gone, roark leaned against the door, closing his eyes. he was sick with 
pity.

he had never felt this befor

prefabricated as complete units; the inner partitions were of light metal 
that could be folded into the walls to provide one large room or pulled out to divide it; there 
were few halls or lobbies to clean, a minimum of cost and labor required for the maintenance 
of the place. the entire plan was a composition in triangles. the buildings, of poured concrete,
were a complex modeling of simple structural features; there was no ornament; none was 
needed; the shapes had the beauty of sculpture.

ellsworth toohey did not look at the plans which keating had spread out on his desk. he 
stared at the perspective drawings. he stared, his mouth open.

then he threw his head back and howled with laughter.

"peter," he said, "you're a genius."

he added: "i think you know exactly what i mean." keating looked at him blankly, without 
curiosity. "you've succeeded in what i've spent a lifetime trying to achieve, in what centuries of 
men and bloody battles behind us have tried to achieve. i take my hat off to you

skyscrapers, of transatlantic cables, of everything man had made.

"howard, this is what i wanted. to have you here with me."

"i know."

"do you know what it really is? avarice. i'm a miser about two things on earth: you and 
dominique. i'm a millionaire who's never owned anything. do you remember what you said 
about ownership? i'm like a savage who's discovered the idea of private property and run 
amuck on it. it's funny. think of ellsworth toohey."

"why ellsworth toohey?"

"i mean, the things he preaches, i've been wondering lately whether he really understands 
what he's advocating. selflessness in the absolute sense? why, that's what i've been. does 
he know that i'm the embodiment of his ideal? of course, he wouldn't approve of my motive, 
but motives never alter facts. if it's true selflessness he's after, in the philosophical sense--and 
mr. toohey is a philosopher--in a sense much beyond matters of money, why, let him look at

they all acting on a selfish motive--to be noticed, liked, admired?"

"--by others. at the price of their own self-respect. in the realm of greatest importance--the 
realm of values, of judgment, of spirit, of thought--they place others above self, in the exact 
manner which altruism demands. a truly selfish man cannot be affected by the approval of

o the honest limit of his exhausted strength. he went from office to office, arguing, 
threatening, pleading. but he had no influence, while his associate designers seemed to 
control an underground river with interlocking tributaries. the officials shrugged and referred 
him to someone else. no one cared about an issue of esthetics. "what's the difference?" "it 
doesn't come out of your pocket, does it?" "who are you to have it all your way? let the boys 
contribute something."

he appealed to ellsworth toohey, but toohey was not interested. he was busy with other 

matters and he had no desire to provoke a bureaucratic quarrel. in all truth, he had not 
prompted his protégés to their artistic endeavor, but he saw no reason for attempting to stop 
them. he was amused by the whole thing. "but it's awful, ellsworth! you know it's awful!" "oh, 
i suppose so. what do you care, peter? your poor but unwashed tenants won't be able to

ellsworth toohey sat back, watched, listened and smiled.

gordon l. prescott and gus webb were entertained at dinners and cocktail parties; they were 
treated with tender, curious solicitude, like survivors of disaster. they said that they could not 
understand what possible motive roark could have had, and they demanded justice.

peter keating went nowhere. he refused to see the press. he refused to see anyone. but he 
issued a written statement that he believed roark was not guilty. his statement contained on

"you make out a good case, gail, and i wouldn't know what to say against it, i don't know 
where you're wrong, but it doesn't sound right to me, because ellsworth toohey--now don't 
misunderstand me, i don't agree with toohey's political views at all, i know he's a radical, but 
on the other hand you've got to admit that he's a great idealist with a heart as big as a house--
well, ellsworth toohey said..."

these were the millionaires, the bankers, the industrialists, the businessmen who could not 
understand why the world was going to hell, as they moaned in all their luncheon speeches.

wynand stood still. he looked at the woman. he saw the white flesh, the mouth hanging open 
in triumphs, the face of self-righteous evil. passersby had seized the woman and she was 
screaming unspeakable obscenities. wynand raised his hand, shook his head, gesturing for 
them to let the creature go, and walked into the banner building, a smear of greenish-yellow 
across his cheek.

"ellsworth, what are we going to do?" moaned alvah scarret. "what are we going to do?"

ellsworth toohey sat perched on the edge of his desk, and smiled as if he wished he could 
kiss alvah scarret.

"why don't they drop the damn thing, ellsworth? why doesn't something break to take it off 
the front pages? couldn't we scare up an international situation or something? in all my born 
days i've never seen people go so wild over so little. a dynamiting job! christ, ellsworth, it's a

"alvah, i love you. you're wonderful, alvah. i love you, but i wish to god you weren't such a 
god-damn fool, so i could talk to you! i wish i could talk to somebody!"

ellsworth toohey tried to talk to gus webb, one evening, but it was disappointing. gus webb 
drawled:

"trouble with you, ellsworth, is you're too romantic. too god-damn metaphysical. what's all 
the gloating about? there's no practical value to the thing. nothing to get your teeth into, 
except for a week or two. i wish he'd blasted it when it was full of people--a few children blown

 pose of the elevator man who fought a desire to turn and 
stare back at him; in the sudden immobility of all the men in his anteroom, in the break of a 
typewriter's clicking on the desk of one secretary, in the lifted hand of another--he saw the 
waiting. then he knew that all the implications of the unbelievable were understood by 
everyone on his paper.

he felt a first dim shock; because the waiting around him contained wonder in anyone's mind 
about the outcome of an issue between him and ellsworth toohey.

but he had no time to take notice of his own reactions. he had no attention to spare for 
anything except a sense of tightness, a pressure against the bones of his face, his teeth, his 
cheeks, the bridge of his nose--and he knew he must press back against that, keep it down, 
hold it.

he greeted no one and walked into his office. alvah scarret sat slumped in a chair before his 
desk. scarret had a bandage of soiled white gauze on his throat, and his cheeks were flushed. 
wynand stopped in t

"i have foisted upon my readers a contemptible blackguard whose spiritual stature is my only 
excuse. i had not reached a degree of contempt for society such as would have permitted me 
to consider him dangerous. i am still holding on to a respect for my fellow men sufficient to let 
me say that ellsworth toohey cannot be a menace."

they say sound never dies, but travels on in space--what happens to a man's heartbeats?--so 
many of them in fifty-six years--could they be gathered again, in some sort of condenser, and 
put to use once more? if they were re-broadcast, would the result be the beating of those 
presses?

strange, humiliating act to perform in our modern age, such is the punishment i impose upon

"i ask the forgiveness of every man who has ever read this paper."

have him listen to those presses--he'll grin in his good, smug, satisfied way, doctors like a 
specimen of perfect health occasionally, it's rare enough--i must give him a treat--the 
healthiest sound he ever heard--and he'll say the banner is good for many years....

the door of his office opened and ellsworth toohey came in.

wynand let him cross the room and approach the desk, without a gesture of protest. wynand 
thought that what he felt was curiosity--if curiosity could be blown into the dimensions of a 
thing from the abyss--like those drawings of beetles the size of a house advancing upon 
human figures in the pages of the banner's sunday supplement--curiosity, because ellsworth 
toohey was still in the building, because toohey had gained admittance past the orders 
given, and because toohey was laug

bloody refuse through the halls. why?--thought alvah 
scarret.

"i can't understand it," he droned in an accentless monotone to anyone around him, "i can't 
understand how ellsworth got so much power....and ellsworth's a man of culture, an idealist, 
not a dirty radical off a soapbox, he's so friendly and witty, and what an erudition!--a man who 
jokes all the time is not a man of violence--ellsworth didn't mean this, he didn't know what it 
would lead to, he loves people, i'd stake my shirt on ellsworth toohey."

once, in wynand's office, he ventured to say:

"gail, why don't you negotiate? why don't you meet with them at least?"

"shut up."

"but, gail, there might be a bit of truth on their side, too. they're newspapermen. you know 
what they say, the freedom of the press..."

then he saw the fit of fury he had expected for days and had thought safely sidetracked--the 
blue irises vanishing in a white smear, the blind, luminous eyeballs in a face that was all 
cavities, the trembling hands. but in

the directors caught themselves in peculiar thoughts: some thought of british tailors, others--
of the house of lords--of the tower of london--of the executed english king--or was it a 
chancellor?--who had died so well.

they did not want to look at the man before them. they leaned upon visions of the pickets 
outside--of the perfumed, manicured women who shrieked their support of ellsworth toohey 
in drawing-room discussions--of the broad, flat face of a girl who paced fifth avenue with a 
placard "we don't read wynand"--for support and courage to say what they were saying.

wynand thought of a crumbling wall on the edge of the hudson. he heard steps approaching 
blocks away. only this time there were no wires in his hand to hold his muscles ready.

"it's gone beyond all sense. is this a business organization or a charitable society for the 
defense of personal friends?"

issue, but she liked to hear of people surrendering. in a kitchen, after dinner, a fat woman 
scraped the remnants off the dishes onto a sheet of newspaper; she never read the front 
page, only the installments of a love serial in the second section; she wrapped onion peelings 
and lamb-chop bones in a copy of the banner.

"it's stupendous," said lancelot clokey, "only i'm really sore at that union, ellsworth. how 
could they double-cross you like that?"

"don't be a sap, lance," said ellsworth toohey. "what do you mean?"

"i told them to accept the terms."

"you did?"

"yep."

"but jesus! 'one small voice'..."

"you can wait for 'one small voice' another month or so, can't you? i've filed suit with the 
labor board today, to be reinstated in my job on the banner. there are more ways than one to 
skin a cat, lance. the skinning isn't important once you've broken its spine."

that evening roark pressed the bell button at the door of wynand's penthouse. the butler 
opened the door and said: "

will appear monstrous and inconceivable."

dominique sat with mallory, heller, lansing, enright, mike--and guy francon, to the shocked 
disapproval of his friends. across the aisle, celebrities formed a comet: from the small point of

cook, gordon l. prescott, gus webb, lancelot clokey, ike, jules fougler, sally brent, homer 
slottern, mitchell layton.

 the suit was not contested and 
dominique was not present at the brief hearing. wynand stood like a man facing a court-

dishonored, granting him lawful sympathy, the status of injured innocence, and a paper that 
was his passport to freedom for all the years before him, and for all the silent evenings of 
those years.

ellsworth toohey won his case before the labor board. wynand was ordered to reinstate him 
in his job.

that afternoon wynand's secretary telephoned toohey and told him that mr. wynand 
expected him back at work tonight, before nine o'clock. toohey smiled, dropping the receiver.

toohey smiled, entering the banner building that evening. he stopped in the city room. he 
waved to people, shook hands, made witty remarks about some current movies, and bore an 
air of guileless astonishment, as if he had been absent

wynand said:

many newspapers bid for the services of ellsworth monkton toohey. he selected the courier, 
a paper of well-bred prestige and gently uncertain policy.

in the evening of his first day on the new job ellsworth toohey sat on the edge of an associate 
editor's desk and they talked about mr. talbot, the owner of the courier, whom toohey had 
met but a few times.

"but mr. talbot as a man?" asked ellsworth toohey. "what's his particular god? what would 
he go to pieces without?"

in the radio room across the hall somebody was twisting a dial. "time," blared a solemn voice,
