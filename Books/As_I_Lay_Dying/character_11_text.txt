"i am not sick," she said. 

"you lay you down and rest you," i said. "i knowed you are not sick. 

you're just tired. you lay you down and rest." 

"i am not sick," she said. "i will get up." 

"lay still and rest," i said. 'you are just tired. you can get up 

tomorrow." and she was laying there, well and hale as ere a woman ever were, 

except for that road. 

"i never sent for you," i said. "i take you to witness i never sent for 
you." 

"i know you didn't," peabody said. "i bound that. where is she?" 

"she's a-laying down," i said. "she's just a little tired, but she'll--" 

"get outen here, anse," he said. "go set on the porch a while." 

and now i got to pay for it, me without a tooth in my head, hoping to get 

ahead enough so i could get my mouth fixed where i could eat god's own victuals

it was nigh to midnight and it had set into rain when he woke us. it had been a 
misdoubtful night, with the storm making; a night when a fellow looks for most 
anything to happen before he can get the stock fed and himself to the house and 
supper et and in bed with the rain starting, and when peabody's team come up, 
lathered, with the broke harness dragging and the neck-yoke betwixt the off 
critter's legs, cora says "it's addie bundren. she's gone at last." 
"peabody mought have been to ere a one of a dozen houses hereabouts," i 
says. "besides, how do you know it's peabody's team?" 
"well, aint it?" she says. "you hitch up, now." 

"what for?" i says. "if she is gone, we cant do nothing till morning. and 
it fixing to storm, too." 

"it's my duty," she says. "you put the team in."

sends for him, i've found. "it's my christian duty," cora says. "will you stand 

between me and my christian duty?" 

"you can stay there all day tomorrow, if you want," i says.

cash ceases the plane and squints along the plank, wiping it with his 
palm. "give me the next one," he says. 

some time toward dawn the rain ceases. but it is not yet day when cash 
drives the last nail and stands stiffly up and looks down at the finished 
coffin, the others watching him. in the lantern light his face is calm, musing; 
slowly he strokes his hands on his rain-coated thighs in a gesture deliberate, 



final and composed. then the four of them--cash and pa and vernon and peabody- 
raise the coffin to their shoulders and turn toward the house. it is light, yet 
they move slowly; empty, yet they carry it carefully; lifeless, yet they move 
with hushed precautionary words to one another, speaking of it as though, 
complete, it now slumbered lightly alive, waiting to come awake. on the dark 
floor their feet clump awkwardly, as though for a long time they have not walked 
on floors. 

they set it down by the bed. peabody says quietly: "let's eat a snack.

it was ten oclock when i got back, with peabody's team hitched on to the back of 
the wagon. they had already dragged the buckboard back from where 
quick found it upside down straddle of the ditch about a mile from the spring. 
it was pulled out of the road at the spring, and about a dozen wagons was 
already there. it was quick found it. he said the rive was up and still rising. 
he said it had already covered the highest water-mark on the bridge-piling he 
ever seen. "that bridge wont stand a whole lot water," i said. "has somebody

we walk up onto the porch and scrape our shoes, a little stiff in our sunday 

clothes, our sunday clothes rustling, not looking full at him as he meets us. 

"the lord giveth," we say. 

"the lord giveth." 

that boy is not there. peabody told about how he come into the kitchen, 
hollering, swarming and clawing at cora when he found her cooking that fish, and 
how dewey dell taken him down to the barn. "my team all right?" peabody says. 
"all right," i tell him. "i give them a bait this morning. your buggy 
seems all right too. it aint hurt." 

"and no fault of somebody's," he says. "i'd give a nickel to know where 
that boy was when that team broke away."

we go back to the trestles and plank-ends and sit or squat. 

"i knowed it would go," armstid says. 

"it's been there a long time, that ere bridge," quick says. 

"the lord has kept it there, yon mean," uncle billy says. "i dont know ere 

a man that's touched hammer to it in twenty-five years." 

"how long has it been there, uncle billy?" quick says. 

"it was built in let me see it was in the year 1 888," 

uncle billy says. "i mind it because the first man to cross it was peabody 
coming to my house when jody was born." 

"if i'd a crossed it every time your wife littered since, it'd a been wore 
out long before this, billy," peabody says. 

we laugh, suddenly loud, then suddenly quiet again. we look a little aside 
at one another. 

"lots of folks has crossed it that wont cross no more bridges," houston 
says. 

"it's a fact," littlejohn says. it's so."

says. 

"he promised her," i say. "she wanted it. she come from there. her mind 
was set on it." 

"and anse is set on it, too," quick says. 

"ay," uncle billy says. "it's like a man that's let everything slide all 

his life to get set on something that will make the most trouble for everybody 

he knows." 

"well, it'll take the lord to get her over that river now," peabody says. 
"anse cant do it." 

"and i reckon he will," quick says. "he's took care of anse a long time, 
now." 

"it's a fact," littlejohn says. 



"too long to quit now," armstid says. 

"i reckon he's like everybody else around here, uncle billy says. "he's 
done it so long now he cant quit." 

cash comes out. he has put on a clean shirt; his hair wet, is combed 

smooth down on his brow, smooth and black as if he had painted it onto his head, 

squats stiffly among us, we watching him.

if it takes wet boards for folks to fall, it's fixing to be lots of 
falling before this spell is done.

neither does peabody mind the folks falling. how bout it, doc? 
it's a fact. washed clean outen the ground it will be. seems like 
something is always happening to it. 

course it does. that's why it's worth anything. if nothing didn't happen 
and everybody made a big crop, do you reckon it would be worth the raising? 
well, i be durn if i like to see my work washed outen the ground, work i

he goes on toward the barn, entering the lot, wooden-backed. 
dewey dell carries the basket on one arm, in the other hand something 
wrapped square in a newspaper. her face is calm and sullen, her eyes brooding 
and alert; within them i can see peabody's back like two round peas in two 
thimbles: perhaps in peabody's back two of those worms which work surreptitious 
and steady through you and out the other side and you waking suddenly from sleep 
or from waking, with on your face an expression sudden, intent, and concerned. 
she sets the basket into the wagon and climbs in, her leg coming long from

caliper which measures the length and breadth of life. she sits

after supper jewel rode over to the bend to get peabody. i heard he was to 
be there today at varner's. jewel come back about midnight. peabody had gone 
down below inverness somewhere, but uncle billy come back with him, with his 
satchel of horse physic. like he says, a man aint so different from a horse or a 
mule, come long come short, except a mule or a horse has got a little more 
sense. "what you been into now, boy?" he says, looking at cash. "get me a

the one somebody you could hear say it dont matter and know it was the truth

"we got the digging to do, too," i said. 

"armstid and gillespie both told you to send word ahead," darl said. "dont 
you want to go to peabody's now, cash?" 

"go on," i said. "it feels right easy now. it's best to get things done in 
the right place." 

"if it was just dug," pa says. "we forgot our spade, too." 

"yes," darl said. "i'll go to the hardware store. we'll have to buy one." 

"it'll cost money," pa says. 

"do you begrudge her it?" darl says. 

"go on and get a spade," jewel said. "here. give me the money." 
but pa didn't stop. "i reckon we can get a spade," he said. "i reckon

of these bull dogs, one of these dogs that dont bark none, squatting against the 

rope, watching the thing he was waiting to jump at. 

he set that way all the time we was in front of mrs bundren's house, 

hearing the music, watching the back of darl's head with them hard white eyes of 

hisn. 

the music was playing in the house. it was one of them graphophones. it 
was natural as a music-band. 

"do you want to go to peabody's?" darl said. "they can wait here and tell 
pa, and l'1 1 drive you to peabody's and come back for them." 
"no," i said. it was better to get her underground, now we was this close, 
just waiting until pa borrowed the shovel. he drove along the street until we 
could hear the music. 

"maybe they got one here," he said. he pulled up at mrs bundren's. it was 

like he knowed. sometimes i think that if a working man could see work as far 

ahead as a lazy man can see laziness. so he stopped ther

"i reckon i better," pa says. he got down and went up the path and around 

the house to the back. the music stopped, then it started again. 

"he'll get it, too," darl said. 

"ay," i said. it was just like he knowed, like he could see through the 
walls and into the next ten minutes. 

only it was more than ten minutes. the music stopped and never commenced 
again for a good spell, where her and pa was talking at the back. we waited in 
the wagon. 

"you let me take you back to peabody's," darl said. 
"no," i said. "we'll get her underground." 

"if he ever gets back," jewel said. he begun to cuss. he started to get 
down from the wagon. "i'm going," he said. 

then we saw pa coming back. he had two spades, coming around the house. he 

laid them in the wagon and got in and we went on. the music never started again. 

pa was looking back at the house. he kind of lifted his hand a little and i saw 

the shade pulled back a little at the window and her face in it.

of what a man has built with his own sweat and stored the fruit of his sweat 
into. 

but i aint so sho that ere a man has the right to say what is crazy and 
what aint. it's like there was a fellow in every man that's done a-past the 
sanity or the insanity, that watches the sane and the insane doings of that man 
with the same horror and the same astonishment.

i said, "i reckon a man in a tight might let bill varner patch him up like a 

damn mule, but i be damned if the man that'd let anse bundren treat him with raw 

cement aint got more spare legs than i have." 

"they just aimed to ease hit some," he said. 

"aimed, hell," i said. "what in hell did armstid mean by even letting them 
put you on that wagon again?" 

"hit was gittin right noticeable," he said. "we never had time to wait." i

he took the money and went out. 



cash 

so when we stopped there to borrow the shovels we heard the graphophone playing 
in the house, and so when we got done with the shovels pa says, "i reckon i 
better take them back." 

so we went back to the house. "we better take cash on to peabody's," jewel 
said. 

"it wont take but a minute," pa said. he got down from the wagon. the 
music was not playing now. 

"let vardaman do it," jewel said. "he can do it in half the time you can. 
or here, you let me--" 

"i reckon i better do it," pa says. "long as it was me that borrowed 
them." 

so we set in the wagon, but the music wasn't playing now. i reckon it's a 
good thing we aint got ere a one of them. i reckon i wouldn't never get no work 
done a-tall for listening to it. i dont know

up so we can start home tomorrow." 

"we got plenty of time," i said. "i wonder what them machines costs on the 
installment." 

"installment of what?" jewel said. "what you got to buy it with?" 
"a fellow cant tell," i said. "i could a bought that one from suratt for 
five dollars, i believe." 

and so pa come back and we went to peabody's. while we was there pa said 

he was going to the barbershop and get a shave. and so that night he said he had 

some business to tend to, kind of looking away from us while he said it, with 

his hair combed wet and slick and smelling sweet with perfume, but i said leave 

him be; i wouldn't mind hearing a little more of that music myself. 

and so next morning he was gone again, then he come back and told us to 

get hitched up and ready to take out and he would meet us and when they was go

me. 

"if it is something we got to have, i reckon maybe peabody," i said. 
"no," he said; "it aint nothing else. you all wait for me at the corner." 
so jewel got the team and come for me and they fixed me a pallet in the 
wagon and we drove across the square to the corner where pa said, and we was
