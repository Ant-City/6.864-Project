"and haddest gold enough, and emily."

saving his olde father egeus,

as he had seen it changen up and down,
joy after woe, and woe after gladness;
and shewed him example and likeness.

"that he ne liv'd in earth in some degree*,             *rank, condition

and we be pilgrims, passing to and fro:
death is an end of every worldly sore."
