of vulnerability and accepting that potentially destructive condition.
at the literal level of the hunt, however, milkman has again held his
own, and the men are fair-minded enough to recognize it; they now share
food and company with him and provide him with the first lead to finding
information about his grandmother, singing bird. finally, they send him to a
woman who completes his process of initiation into their community.
sweet, as she is more than appropriately named, is one of the â€œpretty
womenâ€ milkman has been brash enough to observe upon his arrival in
shalimar. now that he has proved his manhood on their terms, the men
judge him to be ready to sleep with one of the local women. she becomes
one of the rewards for the quester having successfully completed his quest.

and milkman thoroughly enjoying their sharing, especially milkman, who
is awakened to a new sense of awe in physical contact with a woman. â€œwhat
she did for his sore feet, his cut face, his back, his neck, his thighs, and the
palms of his hands was so delicious he couldnâ€™t imagine that the lovemaking
to follow would be anything but anticlimacticâ€ (285). it so far exceeds his
expectations that he offers to give her a bath in return, an action far removed
from anything he has done for hagar

in explaining the personal and social forces that shape the construction
of guitarâ€™s political identity as a militant black nationalist and member of

individual who has been deeply scarred and traumatized by his childhood

think of dead people and white people, because when his father got sliced

to which major despain has sold the timber rights begins to denude
the area. on his way to meet boon under a sweet gum tree in a clearing, ike
encounters a huge rattlesnake, over six feet long, that he addresses as sam in
â€œthe old peopleâ€ had addressed the spirit of the big buck six years earlier:
â€œâ€˜chief,â€™ he said: â€˜grandfatherâ€™â€ (314). this address prepares us for what we
suppose will be another transcendent moment where ike communes with his
ideological parent, sam fathers. however, the part-chickasaw he next sees
is the inept hunter boon, sitting under the gum tree with his disassembled

escape. boon shouts at the approaching figure that he does not recognize as
ike: â€œget out of here! dont touch them! dont touch a one of them! theyâ€™re

fathers, has been co-opted by the values of the timber company to which he
owes his job as town marshal and can see in the absurd plenty in the gum tree
only something to be hoarded.
in turn, then, the sweet gum tree under which boon sits in go down,
moses takes us to the sweet gum in chapter 11 of song of solomon where
milkman sits, exhausted from hunting with the men of shalimar, virginia.

attack of his cat-eyed friend and the subsequent death and dismemberment
of the bobcat, milkman loses the limp that looks like a strut and ceases to be
both the vain peacock and the cock who pees on women.
milkmanâ€™s encounter with the prostitute sweet neatly objectifies his
transformation, since her occupation would normally position her as a commodity,
her sexuality bought, not shared; she is the kind of woman men routinely
treat with no consideration. and yet milkman interacts with her in a
way that directly addresses the catalogue of shortcomings lena had pointed
out to him at the end of part i and serves almost as reparation for the thoughtless
way he had used his cousin hagar:

ical response.20 does milkman actually fly? does he
live or die following his struggle with guitar? finally, i believe, it does not
matter whether milkman survives. he has achieved the very connection to an
african-american community that guitar all along has criticized his friend
for lacking. guitar may believe himself to be the one acting from higher
principles, yet milkman, who even in this moment sees guitar as his brother,
now achieves the transcendence he wrongly felt he had won under the sweet
gum tree. guitarâ€™s adherence to the vision of masculinity as violent mastery
may win the day, but milkmanâ€™s transformation suggests that masculinity can
be conceived in tropes other than those of deadly possession.
but perhaps another reason why the novelâ€™s denouement is so ambiguous
is that morrison could not easily imagine milkman after the moment of

bearing in mind dillardâ€™s words, consider toni morrisonâ€™s description
of milkman when he falls behind on the nighttime hunting trip in the blue
ridge mountains. the other hunters, in pursuit of a bobcat, leave milkman
behind. he is winded. he cannot keep up with their pace. he wants to rest
a while under a sweet gum tree, long enough at least to allow his heart to
drop back down into his chest. there he rests, his mind filled with existential
ponderings, when suddenly, without warning, he experiences a momentary
reprieve from his ego: â€œunder the moon, on the ground, alone, with not even
the sound of baying dogs to remind him that he was with other people, his
selfâ€”the cocoon that was his â€˜personalityâ€™â€”gave way. he could barely see his

one another, when a man could sit down with an ape and the two converse;
when a tiger and a man could share the same tree, and each understood the

feels a sudden rush of brotherly love under the sweet gum tree in the blue
ridge, and believes he may finally understand his country companions and
his friend guitarâ€™s nostalgia for the south. he admires for the first time these
bobcat hunters, men like calvin who can communicate with dogs and â€œreadâ€
the earth: â€œit was more than tracks calvin was looking forâ€”he whispered to
the trees, whispered to the ground, touched them, as a blind man caresses a

belly of the canyon, an individual may experience a â€œstripping down, an ebb
of the press of conventional time, a radical change of proportion, an unspoken
respect for others that elicits keen emotional pleasure, a quick, intimate
pounding of the heart.â€15 in like manner, while alone in the bucolic quiet of
the virginia night, milkman begins to â€œmergeâ€ with the woodlands of his
ancestors: â€œdown either side of his thighs he felt the sweet gumâ€™s surface roots
cradling him like the rough but maternal hands of a grandfather. feeling both
tense and relaxed, he sank his fingers into the grassâ€ (279).
however, for milkman there is no escape to the â€œoriginal garden,â€ for
his moment of â€œunionâ€ with the dirt and sweet gum is interrupted when a

apt, for after milkmanâ€™s interrupted merging with the southern woodlands,
he appears renewed. walking along with the local hunters, milkman â€œfound
himself exhilarated by simply walking the earth. walking it like he belonged
on it; like his legs were stalks, tree trunks, a part of his body that extended
down down down into the rock and soil, and were comfortable thereâ€”on
the earth and on the place where he walkedâ€ (281). perhaps the exhilaration
he feels is a case of â€œdeath makes life sweet,â€ a type of euphoria expressed by
those who have recovered from life-threatening cancers and car wrecks, or
even by those awakening from realistic nightmares to find their bodies warm
and breathing; or maybe milkmanâ€™s elation is the result of a real transformation,
a shift in attitude from one who feels disconnected from other people

for these newly freed ex-slaves, the land is a commodity, property with
which one needs to forge an identity and family history rather than to
escape it. furthermore, after this â€œsermonâ€ on the land, in a descent from
the sublime moment that is even more poignant than milkmanâ€™s interrupted

â€œthe very voices he had been conditioned to ignore under the discipline of
patriarchal hegemonyâ€ (61). as he learns to hear those voices, the ones his
misunderstanding with circe taught him to listen for, he becomes capable
of the sort of reciprocal behavior that he displays with sweet in the bath

ruthâ€™s exclusion from the text, hagarâ€™s tragic death, and sweetâ€™s function as a sexual
reward for milkman, and concludes that â€œsomething in the internal binary logic of

and the contradictions
that underlie the novel.
the setting of the poem is pastoralâ€”a garden that is a type of eden, but
a garden where there is no fall and no expulsion. nature merges with the body
of the lovers, just as milkman feels his body merge with the land as he travels
deeper and deeper into the fields and forests of the south: â€œmilkman rubbed
the back of his head against the bark . . . he felt a sudden rush of affection
for them all . . . down either side of his thighs he felt the sweet gumâ€™s surface
roots cradling him . . . he tried to listen with his fingertips, to hear what, if
anything, the earth had to sayâ€ (278â€“9). the songâ€™s garden is permeated with
sexuality and the mutual passion of a woman and a man. it provides a type for
the antitype scene of sweet and milkmanâ€™s lovemaking. in these brief scenes,
milkman is able for the first time to really give himself toâ€”loveâ€”a woman.
and, in turn, these two scenes provide types for milkmanâ€™s final flight. morriso

novel the man whose name is changed to macon dead is murdered, and his

deeply implicated in issues of narrativity: this is a story about naming, and
its characters frequently bear names which denote their narrative function,
for example pilate, who acts as a guide to the protagonist milkman dead, or
sweet, the woman he wins after completing his ordeal in shalimar. certain
names allude to other stories: hagar, ruth, rebecca, and first corinthians

without recognizing it, as odysseus does in ithaca. yet like odysseus, he has

achieved the self-knowledge that has been his true quest, he has a romantic
affair with a penelope-like woman named sweet with whom he shares a
mutually satisfying intimacy. this refashioning of the epic poem accentuates
the initiatory aspects of milkmanâ€™s experience: his aggressive badinage with
saul in solomonâ€™s store is a form of ritual insult or aischrologia, a frequent
component of initiation rites. other features include the change of clothing

significantly, the nighttime hunting expedition with the elders of the town.25

the second to last chapter of the novel is permeated with the voices of
women, pilate in particular, who sings a song of lamentation at her granddaughterâ€™s
funeral. this tragic turn of events intersects with the heroic resolution
of milkmanâ€™s coming of ageâ€”and as it so often is in classical greek
literature, womenâ€™s lamentation is a disruptive energy.27 moreover, as milkman
is going through his initiation process, hunting with the elders at night
and bathing in the sea with sweet, he is being stalked by the murderous
guitar. the heroic resolution and citational practices that connect his story
to european literary history are further compromised when guitarâ€™s bullet
misses milkman and kills pilate as they are burying jakeâ€™s remains. the novel
ends with milkmanâ€™s revision of the song of solomon as he sings to pilate,
naming her as â€œsugargirlâ€ and then leaping off a cliff in a reenactment of his
great-grandfatherâ€™s flight. the linear tale with its teleology of

n byrd who completes the tale. circeâ€™s position in this respect
is dually coded. her name denotes the androcentric myth, yet she is an agent
who allows the hero to seek for something more than his masculine identity,
his place in the parade of heroes who make the necessary trip to the underworld
with the help of female guardians. this dualism is connoted in part by
her gorgeous voice, the voice of a sexy young woman. as narrator, odysseus
mentions circeâ€™s voice several times; she sings in a sweet or clear voice as she
goes about her weaving (od. 10.221 and 254). correspondingly, morrisonâ€™s
circe is possessed of a â€œstrong young cultivated voiceâ€ (242), the â€œmellifluent 
signifying circe in toni morrisonâ€™s song of solomon 195
voice of a twenty year old girlâ€ (240). in the homeric context female voices
denote danger; the sirens are the most obvious example of this.33 but in a
novel that reverberates with the voices of women, circeâ€™s voice has a different
timbre. one way of ac
