h was all bliss. there it was then, the bass strings like govoreeting away from under my bed at the rest of the orchestra, and then the male human goloss coming in and telling them all to be joyful, and then the lovely blissful tune all about joy being a glorious spark like of heaven, and then i felt the old tigers leap in me and then i leapt on these two young ptitsas. this time they thought nothing fun and stopped creeching with high mirth, and had to submit to the strange and weird desires of alexander the large which, what with the ninth and the hypo jab, were choodessny and zammechat and very demanding, o my brothers. but they were both very very drunken and could hardly feel very much.

when the last movement had gone round for the second time with all the banging and creeching about joy joy joy joy, then these two young ptitsas were not acting the big lady sophisto no more. they were like waking up to what was being done to their malenky persons and saying that they wanted to go home an

h would be bound to have his eemya in, he being the author. there was nothing in my bedroom except a bed and a chair and a light, so i ittied next door to this veck’s own room, and there i viddied his wife on the wall, a bolshy blown-up photo, so i felt a malenky bit sick remembering. but there were two or three shelves of books there too, and there was, as i thought there must be, a copy of ‘a clockwork orange,’ and on the back of the book, like on the spine, was the author’s eemya—f. alexander. good bog, i thought, he is another alex. then i leafed through, standing in his pyjamas and bare nogas but not feeling one malenky bit cold, the cottage being warm all through, and i could not viddy what the book was about. it seemed written in a very bezoomny like style, full of ah and oh and all that cal, but what seemed to come out of it was that all lewdies nowadays were being turned into machines and that they were really—you and me and him and kiss-my-sharries—more like a natural gro

wth like a fruit. f. alexander seemed to think that we all like grow on what he called the world-tree in the world-orchard that like bog or god planted, and we were there because bog or god had need of us to quench his thirsty love, or some such cal. i didn’t like the shoom of this at all, o my brothers, and wondered how bezoomny this f. alexander really was, perhaps driven bezoomny by his wife’s snuffing it. but then he called me down in a like sane veck’s goloss, full of joy and love and all that cal, so down your humble narrator went.

“you’ve slept long,” he said, ladling out boiled eggs and pulling black toast from under the grill. “it’s nearly ten already. i’ve been up hours, working.”

“writing another book, sir?” i said.

“no no, not that now,” he said, and we sat down nice and droogy to the old cr

real horrorshow. written well thou hast, o sir.” and then he looked at me very narrow and said:

“what?” it was like he had not slooshied me before.

“oh, that,” i said, “is what we call nadsat talk. all the teens use that, sir.” so then he ittied off to the kitchen to wash up the dishes, and i was left in these borrowed night platties and toofles, waiting to have done to me what was going to be done to me, because i had no plans for myself, o my brothers.

while the great f. alexander was in the kitchen a dingalingaling came at the door. “ah,” he creeched, coming out wiping his rookers, “it will be these people. i’ll go.” so he went and let them in, a kind of rumbling hahaha of talk and hallo and filthy weather and how are things in the hallway, then they ittied into the room with the fire and the book and the article about how i had suffered, viddying me and going aaaaah as they did it. there were three lewdies, and f. alex gave me their eemyas. z.dolin was a very

they all had a real horrorshow look at me and seemed like overjoyed with what they viddied. z. dolin said:

“all right, all right, eh? what a superb device he can be, this boy. if anything, of course, he could for preference look even iller and more zombyish than he does. anything for the cause. no doubt we can think of something.”

i did not like that crack about zombyish, brothers, and so i said: “what goes on, bratties? what dost thou in mind for thy little droog have?” and the f. alexander swooshed in with:

“strange, strange, that manner of voice pricks me. we’ve come into contact before, i’m sure we have.” and he brooded, like frowning. i would have to watch this, o my brothers. d. b. da silva said:

“public meetings, mainly. to exhibit you at public meetings will be a tremendous help. and, of course, the newspaper angle is all tied up. a ruined life is the approach. we must inflame all hearts.” he showed his thirty-odd zoobies, very white against his dark-colou

olin. “a martyr to the cause of liberty.” he said. “you have your part to play and don’t forget it. meanwhile, we shall look after you.” and he began to stroke my left rooker as if i was like an idiot, grinning in a bezoomny way. i creeched:

“stop treating me like a thing that’s like got to be just used. i’m not an idiot you can impose on, you stupid bratchnies. ordinary prestoopnicks are stupid, but i’m not ordinary and nor am i dim. do you slooshy?”

“dim,” said f. alexander, like musing. “dim. that was a name somewhere. dim.”

“eh?” i said. “what’s dim got to do with it? what do you know about dim?” and then i said: “oh, bog help us.” i didn’t like the look in f. alexander’s glazzies. i made for the door, wanting to go upstairs and get my platties and then itty off.

“i could almost believe,” said f. alexander, showing his stained zoobies, his glazzies mad. “but such things are impossible. for, by christ, if he were i’d tear him.

f all on my oddy knocky. i mean, my gratitude for all, but i have my own jeezny to live.” because, brothers, i wanted to get out of here real skorry. but z. dolin said:

“ah, no. we have you, friend, and we keep you. you come with us. everything will be all right, you’ll see.” and he came up to me like to grab hold of my rooker again. then, brothers, i thought of fight, but thinking of fight made me like want to collapse and sick, so i just stood. and then i saw this like madness in f. alexander’s glazzies and said:

“whatever you say. i am in your rookers. but let’s get it started and all over, brothers.” because what i wanted now was to get out of this mesto called home. i was beginning not to like the look of the glazzies of f. alexander one malenky bit.

“good,” said this rubinstein. “get dressed and let’s get started.”

“dim dim dim,” f. alexander kept saying in a like low mutter. “what or who was this dim?” i ittied upstairs real skorry and dressed

cal. “here is your new home,” said d. b. da silva. “settle here, boy. food is in the food-cupboard. pyjamas are in a drawer. rest, rest, perturbed spirit.”

“eh?” i said, not quite ponying that.

“all right,” said rubinstein, with his starry goloss. “we are now leaving you. work has to be done. we’ll be with you later. occupy yourself as best you can.”

“one thing,” coughed z. dolin kashl kashl kashl. “you saw what stirred in the tortured memory of our friend f. alexander. was it, by chance—? that is to say, did you—? i think you know what i mean. we won’t let it go any further.”

“i’ve paid,” i said. “bog knows i’ve paid for what i did. i’ve paid not only for like myself but for those bratchnies too that called themselves my droogs.” i felt violent so then i felt a bit sick. “i’ll lay down a bit,” i said. “i’ve been through terrible terrible times.”

“you have,” said d. b. da silva, showing all his thirty zoobies. “yo

s. we have put you right, yes? you are getting the best of treatment. we never wished you harm, but there are some who did and do. and i think you know who those are.”

“yes yes yes,” he said. “there are certain men who wanted to use you, yes, use you for political ends. they would have been glad, yes, glad for you to be dead, for they thought they could then blame it all on the government. i think you know who those men are.”

“there is a man,” said the intinfmin, “called f. alexander, a writer of subversive literature, who has been howling for your blood. he has been mad with desire to stick a knife in you. but you’re safe from him now. we put him away.”

“he was supposed to be like a droogie,” i said. “like a mother to me was what he was.”

“he found out that you had done wrong to him. at least,” said the min very very skorry, “he believed you had done wrong. he formed this idea in his mind that you had been responsible for the death of someone near a
