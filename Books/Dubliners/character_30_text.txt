 but one thing only, he said, he would ask of his hearers. and that was: to be straight and manly with god. if their accounts tallied in every point to say:
“well, i have verified my accounts. i find all well.”
but if, as might happen, there were some discrepancies, to admit the truth, to be frank and say like a man:
“well, i have looked into my accounts. i find this wrong and this wrong. but, with god’s grace, i will rectify this and this. i will set right my accounts.”

lily, the caretaker’s daughter, was literally run off her feet. hardly had she brought one gentleman into the little pantry behind the office on the ground floor and helped him off with his overcoat than the wheezy hall-door bell clanged again and she had to scamper along the bare hallway to let in another guest. it was well for her she had not to attend to the ladies also. but miss kate and miss julia had thought of that and had converted the bathroom upstairs into a ladies’ dressing-room. miss

 kate and miss julia were there, gossiping and laughing and fussing, walking after each other to the head of the stairs, peering down over the banisters and calling down to lily to ask her who had come.
it was always a great affair, the misses morkan’s annual dance. everybody who knew them came to it, members of the family, old friends of the family, the members of julia’s choir, any of kate’s pupils that were grown up enough, and even some of mary jane’s pupils too. never once had it fallen flat. for years and years it had gone off in splendid style as long as anyone could remember; ever since kate and julia, after the death of their brother pat, had left the

had the organ in haddington road. she had been through the academy and gave a pupils’ concert every year in the upper room of the antient concert rooms. many of her pupils belonged to the better-class families on the kingstown and dalkey line. old as they were, her aunts also did their share. julia, though she was quite grey, was still the leading soprano in adam and eve’s, and kate, being too feeble to go about much, gave music lessons to beginners on the old square piano in the back room. lily, the caretaker’s daughter, did housemaid’s work for them. though their life was modest they believed in eating well; the best of everything: diamond-bone sirloins, three-shilling tea and the best bottled stout. but lily seldom made a mistake in the orders so that she got on well with her three mistresses. they were fussy, that was all. but the only thing they would not stand was back answers.
of course they had good reason to be fussy on such a night. and then it was long after ten o’cloc

k and yet there was no sign of gabriel and his wife. besides they were dreadfully afraid that freddy malins might turn up screwed. they would not wish for worlds that any of mary jane’s pupils should see him under the influence; and when he was like that it was sometimes very hard to manage him. freddy malins always came late but they wondered what could be keeping gabriel: and that was what brought them every two minutes to the banisters to ask lily had gabriel or freddy come.
“o, mr conroy,” said lily to gabriel when she opened the door for him, “miss kate and miss julia thought you were never coming. good-night, mrs conroy.”
“i’ll engage they did,” said gabriel, “but they forget that my wife here takes three mortal hours to dress herself.”
he stood on the mat, scraping the snow from his goloshes, while lily led his wife to the foot of the stairs and called out:
“miss kate, here’s mrs conroy.”

llow,” called out gabriel from the dark.
he continued scraping his feet vigorously while the three women went upstairs, laughing, to the ladies’ dressing-room. a light fringe of snow lay like a cape on the shoulders of his overcoat and like toecaps on the toes of his goloshes; and, as the buttons of his overcoat slipped with a squeaking noise through the snow-stiffened frieze, a cold, fragrant air from out-of-doors escaped from crevices and folds.
“is it snowing again, mr conroy?” asked lily.
she had preceded him into the pantry to help him off with his overcoat. gabriel smiled at the three syllables she had given his surname and glanced at her. she was a slim, growing girl, pale in complexion and with hay-coloured hair. the gas in the pantry made her look still paler. gabriel had known her when she was a child and used to sit on the lowest step nursing a rag doll.
“yes, lily,” he answered, “and i think we’re in for a night of it.”
he looked up at the pantry ceiling, whic

h was shaking with the stamping and shuffling of feet on the floor above, listened for a moment to the piano and then glanced at the girl, who was folding his overcoat carefully at the end of a shelf.
“tell me, lily,” he said in a friendly tone, “do you still go to school?”
“o no, sir,” she answered. “i’m done schooling this year and more.”
“o, then,” said gabriel gaily, “i suppose we’ll be going to your wedding one of these fine days with your young man, eh?”
the girl glanced back at him over her shoulder and said with great bitterness:
“the men that is now is only all palaver and what they can get out of you.”
gabriel coloured as if he felt he had made a mistake and, without

atches of pale red; and on his hairless face there scintillated restlessly the polished lenses and the bright gilt rims of the glasses which screened his delicate and restless eyes. his glossy black hair was parted in the middle and brushed in a long curve behind his ears where it curled slightly beneath the groove left by his hat.
when he had flicked lustre into his shoes he stood up and pulled his waistcoat down more tightly on his plump body. then he took a coin rapidly from his pocket.
“o lily,” he said, thrusting it into her hands, “it’s christmas-time, isn’t it? just ... here’s a little....”
he walked rapidly towards the door.
“o no, sir!” cried the girl, following him. “really, sir, i wouldn’t take it.”
“christmas-time! christmas-time!” said gabriel, almost trotting to the stairs and waving his hand to her in deprecation.
the girl, seeing that he had gained the stairs, called out after him:
“well, thank you, sir.”
he waited outside the drawing-room do

. “of course, you’ve seen about the room. gretta was saying....”
“o, the room is all right,” replied gabriel. “i’ve taken one in the gresham.”
“to be sure,” said aunt kate, “by far the best thing to do. and the children, gretta, you’re not anxious about them?”
“o, for one night,” said mrs conroy. “besides, bessie will look after them.”
“to be sure,” said aunt kate again. “what a comfort it is to have a girl like that, one you can depend on! there’s that lily, i’m sure i don’t know what has come over her lately. she’s not the girl she was at all.”
gabriel was about to ask his aunt some questions on this point but she broke off suddenly to gaze after her sister who had wandered down the stairs and was craning her neck over the banisters.
“now, i ask you,” she said almost testily, “where is julia going? julia! julia! where are you going?”
julia, who had gone half way down one flight, came back and announced blandly:
“here’s freddy.

looked to the edge of the carver, plunged his fork firmly into the goose. he felt quite at ease now for he was an expert carver and liked nothing better than to find himself at the head of a well-laden table.
“miss furlong, what shall i send you?” he asked. “a wing or a slice of the breast?”
“just a small slice of the breast.”
“miss higgins, what for you?”
“o, anything at all, mr conroy.”
while gabriel and miss daly exchanged plates of goose and plates of ham and spiced beef lily went from guest to guest with a dish of hot floury potatoes wrapped in a white napkin. this was mary jane’s idea and she had also suggested apple sauce for the goose but aunt kate had said that plain roast goose without any apple sauce had always been good enough for her and she hoped she might never eat worse. mary jane waited on her pupils and saw that they got the best slices and aunt kate and aunt julia opened and carried across from the piano bottles of stout and ale for the gentlemen an

er’s way and giving each other unheeded orders. mr browne begged of them to sit down and eat their suppers and so did gabriel but they said they were time enough so that, at last, freddy malins stood up and, capturing aunt kate, plumped her down on her chair amid general laughter.
when everyone had been well served gabriel said, smiling:
“now, if anyone wants a little more of what vulgar people call stuffing let him or her speak.”
a chorus of voices invited him to begin his own supper and lily came forward with three potatoes which she had reserved for him.
“very well,” said gabriel amiably, as he took another preparatory draught, “kindly forget my existence, ladies and gentlemen, for a few minutes.”
he set to his supper and took no part in the conversation with which the table covered lily’s removal of the plates. the subject of talk was the opera company which was then at the theatre royal. mr bartell d’arcy, the tenor, a dark-complexioned young man with a smart moustac
