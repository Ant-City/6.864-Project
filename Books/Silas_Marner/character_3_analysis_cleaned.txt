[CHARACTER] 

nancy is the pretty, caring, and stubborn young lady whom
godfrey pursues and then marries. like godfrey, nancy comes from
a family that is wealthy by raveloe standards. however, her father, unlike
squire cass, is a man who values moral rectitude, thrift, and hard
work. nancy has inherited these strict values and looks disapprovingly
on what she sees as godfrey's weakness of character. she is, however,
exhilarated by godfrey's attention, in part because of the status
he embodies.
	nancy lives her life according to an inflexible code
of behavior and belief. she seems to have already decided how she
feels about every question that might come up in her life, not necessarily
on the basis of any reason or thought, but simply because anything
else would represent a sort of weakness in her own eyes. when nancy
is younger, this "code" of hers demands that she and her sister
dress alike on formal occasions. when she is older, nancy's code
forbids her to adopt a child, as in her mind such an action represents
a defiance of god's plan. nancy is neither well educated nor particularly curious,
and her code marks her as just as much a product of raveloe's isolation
and rusticity as dolly winthrop. nancy is, however, a genuinely
kind and caring person, as evidenced by her forgiveness of godfrey
after his confession.
