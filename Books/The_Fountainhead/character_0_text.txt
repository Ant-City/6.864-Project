oal of my writing, an address i gave at lewis and clark college, on october 
1, 1963: "this is the motive and purpose of my writing; the projection of an ideal man. the 
portrayal of a moral ideal, as my ultimate literary goal, as an end in itself--to which any 
didactic, intellectual or philosophical values contained in a novel are only the means.

"let me stress this: my purpose is not the philosophical enlightenment of my readers...my 
purpose, first cause and prime mover is the portrayal of howard roark [or the heroes of atlas

"i write--and read--for the sake of the story...my basic test for any story is: 'would i want to 
meet these characters and observe these events in real life? is this story an experience worth 
living through for its own sake? is the pleasure of contemplating these characters an end in 
itself?'...

i offer my profound gratitude to the great profession of architecture and its heroes who have 
given us some of the highest expressions of man's genius, yet have remained unknown, 
undiscovered by the majority of men. and to the architects who gave me their generous 
assistance in the technical matters of this book.

howard roark laughed.

he stood naked at the edge of a cliff. the lake lay far below him. a frozen explosion of granite 
burst in flight to the sky over motionless water. the water seemed immovable, the stone--
flowing. the stone had the stillness of one brief moment in battle when thrust meets thrust 
and the currents are held in a pause more dynamic than motion. the stone glowed, wet with 
sunrays.

the lake below was only a thin steel ring that cut the rocks in half. the rocks went on into the

tone. it opened the way into long streets edged by tight, exhibitionist lawns. behind the lawns 
stood wooden piles tortured out of all shape: twisted into gables, turrets, dormers; bulging with 
porches; crushed under huge, sloping roofs. white curtains floated at the windows. a garbage 
can stood at a side door, flowing over. an old pekinese sat upon a cushion on a door step, its 
mouth drooling. a line of diapers fluttered in the wind between the columns of a porch.

people turned to look at howard roark as he passed. some remained staring after him with 
sudden resentment. they could give no reason for it: it was an instinct his presence 
awakened in most people. howard roark saw no one. for him, the streets were empty. he 
could have walked there naked without concern. he crossed the heart of stanton, a broad 
green edged by shop windows. the windows displayed new placards announcing:

welcome to the class of  '22!  good luck,  class of  '22!  the class of '22 of the 
stanton institute of tec

unalterably right. the hand that had made the sharp pencil lines still had much to learn. but 
not a line seemed superfluous, not a needed plane was missing. the structures were austere 
and simple, until one looked at them and realized what work, what complexity of method, what 
tension of thought had achieved the simplicity. no laws had dictated a single detail. the 
buildings were not classical, they were not gothic, they were not renaissance. they were 
only howard roark.

he stopped, looking at a sketch. it was one that had never satisfied him. he had designed it 
as an exercise he had given himself, apart from his schoolwork; he did that often when he 
found some particular site and stopped before it to think of what building it should bear. he 
had spent nights staring at this sketch, wondering what he had missed. glancing at it now, 
unprepared, he saw the mistake he had made.

he flung the sketch down on the table, he bent over it, he slashed lines straigh

you say it was an answer to an assignment or 
plain insubordination?"

"it was insubordination," said roark.

"we wanted to give you a chance--in view of your brilliant record in all other subjects. but 
when you turn in this--" the dean slammed his fist down on a sheet spread before him--"this 
as a renaissance villa for your final project of the year--really, my boy, it was too much!"

the sheet bore a drawing--a house of glass and concrete. in the comer there was a sharp, 
angular signature: howard roark.

"how do you expect us to pass you after this?"

"i don't."

"you left us no choice in the matter. naturally, you would feel bitterness toward us at this 
moment, but..."

"i feel nothing of the kind," said roark quietly. "i owe you an apology. i don't usually let things 
happen to me. i made a mistake this time. i shouldn't have waited for you to throw me out. i 
should have left long ago."

"now, now, don't get discouraged. this is not the right attitude to take. particularly in view of

don't interrupt me, you've seen a modernistic building or two, 
and it gave you ideas. but do you realize what a passing fancy that whole so-called modern 
movement is? you must learn to understand--and it has been proved by all authorities--that 
everything beautiful in architecture has been done already. there is a treasure mine in every 
style of the past. we can only choose from the great masters. who are we to improve upon 
them? we can only attempt, respectfully, to repeat."

"why?" asked howard roark.

no, thought the dean, no, he hasn't said anything else; it's a perfectly innocent word; he's not 
threatening me.

"but it's self-evident!" said the dean.

"look," said roark evenly, and pointed at the window. "can you see the campus and the 
town? do you see how many men are walking and living down there? well, i don't give a 
damn what any or all of them think about architecture--or about anything else, for that matter. 
why should i consider what their grandfathers thought of it?"

building. he forgot men, the dean and the principle behind the dean, which he wanted to 
discover. he thought only of how lovely the stone looked in the fragile light and of what he 
could have done with that stone.

he thought of a broad sheet of paper, and he saw, rising on the paper, bare walls of gray 
limestone with long bands of glass, admitting the glow of the sky into the classrooms. in the 
comer of the sheet stood a sharp, angular signature--howard roark.

"...architecture, my friends, is a great art based on two cosmic principles: beauty and 
utility. in a broader sense, these are but part of the three eternal entities: truth, love and 
beauty. truth--to the traditions of our art, love--for our fellow men whom we are to serve, 
beauty--ah, beauty is a compelling goddess to all artists, be it in the shape of a lovely woman 
or a building....hm....yes....in conclusion, i should like to say to you, who are about to embark

as long and solemn. keating listened to the speeches with 
interest; when he heard the endless sentences about "young men as the hope of american 
architecture" and "the future opening its golden gates," he knew that he was the hope and his 
was the future, and it was pleasant to hear this confirmation from so many eminent lips. he 
looked at the gray-haired orators and thought of how much younger he would be when he 
reached their positions, theirs and beyond them.

then he thought suddenly of howard roark. he was surprised to find that the flash of that 
name in his memory gave him a sharp little twinge of pleasure, before he could know why. 
then he remembered: howard roark had been expelled this morning. he reproached himself 
silently; he made a determined effort to feel sorry. but the secret glow came back, whenever 
he thought of that expulsion. the event proved conclusively that he had been a fool to imagine 
roark a dangerous rival; at one time, he had worried about roark more than about

ained any doubts on their respective gifts, hadn't this day settled it all? and, he 
remembered, roark had been very nice to him, helping him whenever he was stuck on a 
problem...not stuck, really, just did not have the time to think it out, a plan or something. 
christ! how roark could untangle a plan, like pulling a string and it was open...well, what if he 
could? what did it get him? he was done for now. and knowing this, peter keating 
experienced at last a satisfying pang of sympathy for howard roark.

when keating was called upon to speak, he rose confidently. he could not show that he was 
terrified. he had nothing to say about architecture. but he spoke, his head high, as an equal 
among equals, just subtly diffident, so that no great name present could take offense. he 
remembered saying: "architecture is a great art...with our eyes to the future and the reverence 
of the past in our hearts...of all the crafts, the most important one sociologically...and, as the

nt careers. and once on top, did they ever fail? 
suddenly, he recalled henry cameron; builder of skyscrapers twenty years ago; old drunkard 
with offices on some waterfront today. keating shuddered and walked faster.

he wondered, as he walked, whether people were looking at him. he watched the rectangles 
of lighted windows; when a curtain fluttered and a head leaned out, he tried to guess whether 
it had leaned to watch his passing; if it hadn't, some day it would; some day, they all would.

howard roark was sitting on the porch steps when keating approached the house. he was 
leaning back against the steps, propped up on his elbows, his long legs stretched out. a 
morning-glory climbed over the porch pillars, as a curtain between the house and the light of a 
lamppost on the corner.

it was strange to see an electric globe in the air of a spring night. it made the street darker and
softer; it hung alone, like a gap, and left nothing to be seen but a few branches heavy with 
leaves, standing st

, when his name was mentioned for a commission: "cameron? i should say 
not. he drinks like a fish. that's why he never gets any work." he lived to move from the 
offices that occupied three floors of a famous building to one floor on a less expensive street, 
then to a suite farther downtown, then to three rooms facing an air shaft, near the battery. he 
chose these rooms because, by pressing his face to the window of his office, he could see, 
over a brick wall, the top of the dana building.

howard roark looked at the dana building beyond the windows, stopping at each landing, as 
he mounted the six flights of stairs to henry cameron's office; the elevator was out of order. 
the stairs had been painted a dirty file-green a long time ago; a little of the paint remained to 
grate under shoe soles in crumbling patches. roark went up swiftly, as if he had an 
appointment, a folder of his drawings under his arm, his eyes on the dana building. he 
collided once with a man descending the stairs; this

impertinent. you're too sure of yourself. twenty years ago i'd have punched your face with the 
greatest of pleasure. you're coming to work here tomorrow at nine o'clock sharp."

"yes," said roark, rising.

"fifteen dollars a week. that's all i can pay you."

"yes."

"you're a damn fool. you should have gone to someone else. i'll kill you if you go to anyone 
else. what's your name?"

"howard roark."

"if you're late, i'll fire you."

"yes."

roark extended his hand for the drawings.

"leave these here!" bellowed cameron. "now get out!"

"toohey," said guy francon, "ellsworth toohey. pretty decent of him, don't you think? read 
it, peter."

francon leaned jovially across his desk and handed to keating the august issue of new 
frontiers. new frontiers had a white cover with a black emblem that combined a palette, a 
lyre, a hammer, a screw driver and a rising sun; it had a circulation

for it, but you won't care, if only he'd let you put up that building, you won't care, you'll want to 
rip your insides open to show him, because if he saw what's there he'd have to let you put it 
up. but he'll say that he's very sorry, only the commission has just been given to guy francon. 
and you'll go home, and do you know what you'll do there? you'll cry. you'll cry like a woman, 
like a drunkard, like an animal. that's your future, howard roark. now, do you want it?"

"yes," said roark.

cameron's eyes dropped; then his head moved down a little, then a little farther; his head 
went on dropping slowly, in long, single jerks, then stopped; he sat still, his shoulders 
hunched, his arms huddled together in his lap.

"howard," whispered cameron, "i've never told it to anyone...."

"thank you...." said roark.

after a long time, cameron raised his head.

"go home now," said cameron, his voice flat. "you've worked too much lately. and you

he saw catherine halsey occasionally. he had not gone to her on that following evening, as 
he had promised. he had awakened in the morning and remembered the things he had said 
to her, and hated her for his having said them. but he had gone to her again, a week later; she 
had not reproached him and they had not mentioned her uncle. he saw her after that every 
month or two; he was happy when he saw her, but he never spoke to her of his career.

he tried to speak of it to howard roark; the attempt failed. he called on roark twice; he 

climbed, indignantly, the five flights of stairs to roark's room. he greeted roark eagerly; he 
waited for reassurance, not knowing what sort of reassurance he needed nor why it could 
come only from roark. he spoke of his job and he questioned roark, with sincere concern, 
about cameron's office. roark listened to him, answered all his questions willingly, but 
keating felt that he was knocking against a sheet of iron in roark's unmoving eye

men were still worshipping the masters who had done it before him. he did not have to 
wonder, to fear or to take chances; it had been done for him.

when the drawings were ready, he stood looking at them uncertainly. were he to be told that 
this was the best or the ugliest house in the world, he would agree with either. he was not 
sure. he had to be sure. he thought of stanton and of what he had relied upon when working 
on his assignments there. he telephoned cameron's office and asked for howard roark.

he came to roark's room, that night, and spread before him the plans, the elevations, the 
perspective of his first building. roark stood over it, his arms spread wide, his hands holding 
the edge of the table, and he said nothing for a long time.

keating waited anxiously; he felt anger growing with his anxiety--because he could see no 
reason for being so anxious. when he couldn't stand it, he spoke:

"you know, howard, everybody says stengel's the best designer in town, and i don't think h

upted francon's well-bred bargaining with 
an antique dealer over a snuffbox that had belonged to madame pompadour. francon was 
precipitated into paying nine dollars and twenty-five cents more than he had intended to pay. 
he turned to keating testily, after the dealer had left, and asked:

"well, what is it, peter, what is it?"

keating threw the bulletin down on francon's desk, his thumbnail underscoring the paragraph 
about cameron.

"i've got to have that man," said keating.

"what man?"

"howard roark."

"who the hell," asked francon, "is howard roark?"

"i've told you about him. cameron's designer."

"oh...oh, yes, i believe you did. well, go and get him."

"do you give me a free hand on how i hire him?"

"what the hell? what is there about hiring another draftsman? incidentally, did you have to 
interrupt me for that?"

"he might be difficult. and i want to get him before he decides on anyone else."

"really? he's going to be difficult about it, is he? do you intend to beg him to come here

 this afternoon, will you?"

"yes."

heller studied the man who sat facing him. he saw the hand lying on the table before him. 
heller's awareness became focused on that hand. he saw the long fingers, the sharp joints, 
the prominent veins. he had the feeling that he was not hiring this man, but surrendering 
himself into his employment. "how old are you," asked heller, "whoever you are?"

"twenty-six. do you want any references?"

"hell, no. i have them, here in my pocket. what's your name?"

"howard roark."

heller produced a checkbook, spread it open on the table and reached for his fountain pen.

"look," he said, writing, "i'll give you five hundred dollars on account. get yourself an office or 
whatever you have to get, and go ahead."

he tore off the check and handed it to roark, between the tips of two straight fingers, leaning 
forward on his elbow, swinging his wrist in a sweeping curve. his eyes were narrowed, 
amused, watching roark quizzically. but the gesture had the air of a salute.

the check was made out to "howard roark, architect."

howard roark opened his own office.

it was one large room on the top of an old building, with a broad window high over the roofs. 
he could see the distant band of the hudson at his window sill, with the small streaks of ships 
moving under his fingertips when he pressed them to the glass. he had a desk, two chairs, 
and a huge drafting table. the glass entrance door bore the words: "howard roark, 
architect." he stood in the hall for a long time, looking at the words. then he went in, and 
slammed his door, he picked up a t-square from the table and flung it down again, as if 
throwing an anchor.

john erik snyte had objected. when roark came to the office for his drawing instruments 
snyte emerged into the reception room, shook his hand warmly and said: "well, roark! well, 
how are you? come in, come right in, i want to speak to you!"

"we've signed the contract yesterday."

"oh, you have? well, that's splendid! well, look, roark, i'll tell you what we'll do: you bring the

"well," he said at last, "i did live to see it."

he dropped the snapshot.

he picked up the snapshot.

he held it between them.

fame throughout the countryside surrounding it. people drove out 
of their way to park on the road before it, to stare, point and giggle. gas-station attendants 
snickered when heller's car drove past. heller's cook had to endure the derisive glances of 
shopkeepers when she went on her errands. the heller house was known in the 
neighborhood as "the booby hatch."

peter keating told his friends in the profession, with an indulgent smile: "now, now, you 
shouldn't say that about him. i've known howard roark for a long time, and he's got quite a 
talent, quite. he's even worked for me once. he's just gone haywire on that house. he'll learn. 
he has a future....oh, you don't think he has? you really don't think he has?"

ellsworth m. toohey, who let no stone spring from the ground of america without his 
comment, did not know that the heller house had been erected, as far as his column was 
concerned. he did not consider it necessary to inform his readers about it, if only to damn it.

fargo store, he received another commission.

mr. whitford sanborn, the client, owned an office building that had been built for him many 
years ago by henry cameron. when mr. sanborn decided that he needed a new country 
residence he rejected his wife's suggestions of other architects; he wrote to henry cameron. 
cameron wrote a ten-page letter in answer; the first three lines of the letter stated that he had 
retired from practice; the rest of it was about howard roark. roark never learned what had 
been said in that letter; sanborn would not show it to him and cameron would not tell him. but 
sanborn signed him to build the country residence, in spite of mrs. sanborn's violent 
objections.

mrs. sanborn was the president of many charity organizations and this had given her an 
addiction to autocracy such as no other avocation could develop. mrs. sanborn wished a

en he grasped suddenly that it was not a vague threat, 
but a practical danger; and he lost all fear of it. he could deal with a practical danger, he could 
dispose of it quite simply. he chuckled with relief, he telephoned roark's office, and made an 
appointment to see him.

he went to that appointment confidently. for the first time in his life he felt free of the strange 
uneasiness which he had never been able to explain or escape in roark's presence. he felt 
safe now. he was through with howard roark.

roark sat at the desk in his office, waiting. the telephone had rung once, that morning, but it 
had been only peter keating asking for an appointment. he had forgotten now that keating 
was coming. he was waiting for the telephone. he had become dependent on that telephone 
in the last few weeks. he was to hear at any moment about his drawings for the manhattan 
bank company.

his rent on the office was long since overdue. so was the rent on the room where he lived. he

he produced his billfold, pulled from it a check he had made out in advance and put it down 
on the desk. it read: "pay to the order of howard roark--the sum of five hundred dollars."

then he turned it over, took his fountain pen, wrote on the back: "pay to the order of peter

wrists, his shoulders and the drill he held--to feel the drill trembling in a long convulsive 
shudder--to feel his stomach trembling, his lungs trembling, the straight lines of the stone 
ledges before him dissolving into jagged streaks of trembling--to feel the drill and his body 
gathered into the single will of pressure, that a shaft of steel might sink slowly into granite--this 
was all of life for howard roark, as it had been in the days of the two months behind him.

he stood on the hot stone in the sun. his face was scorched to bronze. his shirt stuck in long, 
damp patches to his back. the quarry rose about him in flat shelves breaking against one 
another. it was a world without curves, grass or soil, a simplified world of stone planes, sharp 
edges and angles. the stone had not been made by patient centuries welding the sediment of 
winds and tides; it had come from a molten mass cooling slowly

he reached for another piece of toast. he saw, at the end of the table, left there for him by his 
mother, the heavy pile of the sunday paper. he picked it up, feeling strong enough, in this 
moment, in the confidence of his secret spiritual grandeur, to face the whole world contained 
in that pile. he pulled out the rotogravure section. he stopped. he saw the reproduction of a 
drawing: the enright house by howard roark.

he did not need to see the caption or the brusque signature in the corner of the sketch; he 
knew that no one else had conceived that house and he knew the manner of drawing, serene 
and violent at once, the pencil lines like high-tension wires on the paper, slender and innocent 
to see, but not to be touched. it was a structure on a broad space by the east river. he did 
not grasp it as a building, at first glance, but as a rising mass of rock crystal. there was the

clean angles, space slashed with a knife, yet in a harmony of formation as delicate as the 
work of a jeweler; an incredible variety of shapes, each separate unit unrepeated, but leading 
inevitably to the next one and to the whole; so that the future inhabitants were to have, not a 
square cage out of a square pile of cages, but each a single house held to the other houses 
like a single crystal to the side of a rock. keating looked at the sketch. he had known for a 
long time that howard roark had been chosen to build the enright house. he had seen a few 
mentions of roark's name in the papers; not much, all of it to be summed up only as "some 
young architect chosen by mr. enright for some reason, probably an interesting young 
architect." the caption under the drawing announced that the construction of the project was 
to begin at once. well, thought keating, and dropped the paper, so what? the paper fell 
beside the black and scarlet book. he looked at both. he felt dimly as if lo

fitted too tightly, revealing the solid rigidity of her corset; a small pin glittered at her throat,

e room and saw the sunday papers. this was a question he had wanted to 
ask for a long time. he asked cautiously:

"ellsworth...what do you think of roark?"

"roark? roark?" asked toohey. "who is roark?" the too innocent, too trifling manner in 
which he repeated the name, with the faint, contemptuous question mark quite audible at the 
end, made keating certain that toohey knew the name well. one did not stress total 
ignorance of a subject if one were in total ignorance of it. keating said:

"howard roark. you know, the architect. the one who's doing the enright house."

"oh? oh, yes, someone's doing that enright house at last, isn't he?"

"is there? i did glance through the chronicle."

"and...what do you think of that building?"

"if it were important, i should have remembered it."

"of course!" keating's syllables danced, as if his breath caught at each one in passing: "it's an 
awful, crazy thing! like nothing you ever saw or want to see!"

"do i know him! why, we went to school together--stanton, you know--why, he lived at our 
house for three years, i can tell you the color of his underwear and how he takes a shower--
i've seen him!"

"he lived at your house in stanton?" toohey repeated. toohey spoke with a kind of cautious 
precision. the sounds of his voice were small and dry and final, like the cracks of matches 
being broken.

it was very peculiar, thought keating. toohey was asking him a great many questions about 
howard roark. but the questions did not make sense. they were not about buildings, they 
were not about architecture at all. they were pointless personal questions--strange to ask 
about a man of whom he had never heard before.

"does he laugh often?"

"very rarely."

"does he seem unhappy?"

"never."

"did he have many friends at stanton?"

"he's never had any friends anywhere."

"the boys didn't like him?"

"nobody can like him."

"why?"

"he makes you feel it would be an impertinence to like him."

"can we count on your presence at our next meeting?" toohey asked. "it is pleasant to have 
so understanding a listener who will not be in the way at all--at our next meeting, i mean."

"no, ellsworth. thank you. it was merely curiosity. though you do have an interesting group of 
people here. young builders. by the way, why didn't you invite that man who designed the 
enright house--what's his name?--howard roark?"

keating felt his jaw snap tight. but she looked at them innocently, she had said it lightly, in the 
tone of a casual remark--surely, he thought, she did not mean...what? he asked himself and 
added: she did not mean whatever it was he'd thought for a moment she meant, whatever had 
terrified him in that moment.

"i have never had the pleasure of meeting mr. roark," toohey answered gravely.

"do you know him?" keating asked her.

"no," she answered. "i've merely seen a sketch of the enright

longer. she looked at them as they approached. her feet stood posed oddly, two small 
triangles pointed straight and parallel, as if there were no floor around her but the few square 
inches under her soles and she were safe so long as she did not move or look down. he felt a 
violent pleasure, because she seemed too fragile to stand the brutality of what he was doing; 
and because she stood it so well.

"miss francon, may i present howard roark?" said heller.

he had not raised his voice to pronounce the name; he wondered why it had sounded so 
stressed; then he thought that the silence had caught the name and held it still; but there had 
been no silence: roark's face was politely blank and dominique was saying correctly:

"how do you do, mr. roark."

roark bowed: "how do you do, miss francon."

she said: "the enright house..."

she said it as if she had not wanted to pronounce these three words; and as if they named, 
not a house, b

a window on the thirtieth floor, wondering about his 
own body were it to be hurled down and what would happen when he struck against that 
pavement. he did not know the man's name, his profession or his past; he had no need to 
know; it was not a man to him, but only a force; toohey never saw men. perhaps it was the 
fascination of seeing that particular force so explicitly personified in a human body.

after a while he asked john erik snyte, pointing:

"who is that man?"

"that?" said snyte. "howard roark. you know, the enright house."

"oh," said toohey.

"what?"

"of course. it would be."

"want to meet him?"

"no," said toohey. "no, i don't want to meet him."

for the rest of the evening whenever some figure obstructed toohey's view of the hall, his 
head would jerk impatiently to find roark again. he did not want to look at roark; he had to 
look; just as he always had to look down at that distant pavement, dreading the sight.

that evening, ellsworth toohey was conscious of no one but roark

when roark left, dominique stood counting the minutes, to be certain that he would be lost to 
sight in the streets before she could trust herself to go out. then she moved to leave.

kiki holcombe's thin, moist fingers clasped her hand in parting, clasped it vaguely and slipped 
up to hold her wrist for a moment.

"and, my dear," asked kiki holcombe, "what did you think of that new one, you know, i saw 
you talking to him, that howard roark?"

"i think," said dominique firmly, "that he is the most revolting person i've ever met."

"oh, now, really?"

"do you care for that sort of unbridled arrogance? i don't know what one could say for him, 
unless it's that he's terribly good-looking, if that matters."

"good-looking! are you being funny, dominique?"

kiki holcombe saw dominique being stupidly puzzled for once. and dominique realized that 
what she saw in his face, what made it the face of a god to her, was not seen by others; th

gothic architecture. the stained-glass window in the chapel is really one of the finest in this 
country. and then, think, so many young students. all so different. some graduating with high 
honors. others being expelled."

"no. is he?"

"he is."

"peter keating is an old friend of everybody."

he did not sit down, but stood examining the place with the unhurried curiosity of an expert.

"not bad, dominique. just about as i'd expect you to have it. a little cold. you know, i wouldn't 
have that ice-blue chair over there. too obvious. fits in too well. just what people would 
expect in just that spot. i'd have it carrot red. an ugly, glaring, outrageous red. like mr.

"you need me, dominique. you might as well understand me a little. you see, i'm not afraid of

"i need you?"

"oh, come on, show a little courage, too."

she sat up and waited coldly, silently. he smiled, obviously with pleasure, making no effort to 
hide the pleasure.

"let's see," he said, studying the ceiling with casual attention, "those commissions you got for 
peter keating. the cryon office building was mere nuisance value--howard roark never had 
a chance at that. the lindsay home was better--roark was definitely considered, i think he 
would have got it but for you. the stonebrook clubhouse also--he had a chance at that, which 
you ruined." he looked at her and chuckled softly. "no comments on techniques and punches,

listened emptily to empty words uttered as if the speaker would be insulted by any sign of 
enthusiastic interest from his listener, as if only boredom were the only bond possible between 
people, the only preservative of their precarious dignity. she nodded to everything and 
accepted everything.

"yes, mr. holt, i think peter keating is the man of the century--our century."

late at night, often, she came to roark's room. she came unannounced, certain of finding 
him there and alone. in his room, there was no necessity to spare, lie, agree and erase herself 
out of being. here she was free to resist, to see her resistance welcomed by an adversary too 
strong to fear a contest, strong enough to need it; she found a will granting her the recognition 
of her own entity, untouched and not to be touched except in clean battle, to win or to be 
defeated, but to be pre

at her, only his fingers closed over her wrist and he pushed her hand farther down under his 
shirt, pressing it hard against his skin. then she pulled his head back, and she bent down to 
cover his mouth with hers.

she came in and found a copy of the banner spread out on his table, open at the page 
bearing "your house" by dominique francon. her column contained the line: "howard roark 
is the marquis de sade of architecture. he's in love with his buildings--and look at them." she 
knew that he disliked the banner, that he put it there only for her sake, that he watched her 
noticing it, with the half-smile she dreaded on his face. she was angry; she wanted him to 
read everything she wrote, yet she would have preferred to think that it hurt him enough to 
make him avoid it. later, lying across the bed, with his mouth on her breast, she looked past

"yes. possibly. put your hand on my back, roark. just hold it there. like that." she lay still, 
her face buried against his knees, her arm hanging down over the side of the bed, not moving, 
as if nothing in her were alive but the skin between her shoulder blades under his hand.

in the drawing rooms she visited, in the restaurants, in the offices of the a.g.a. people talked 
about the dislike of miss dominique francon of the banner for howard roark, that 
architectural freak of roger enright's. it gave him a sort of scandalous fame. it was said: 
"roark? you know, the guy dominique francon can't stand the guts of."

"the francon girl knows her architecture all right, and if she says he's no good, he must be 
worse than i thought he was."

"god, but these two must hate each other! though i understand they haven't even met." she 
liked to hear these things. it pleased her when athelstan beasely wrote in his column in the

in that particular rhythm. the walls of pale 
gray limestone looked silver against the sky, with the clean, dulled luster of metal, but a metal 
that had become a warm, living substance, carved by the most cutting of all instruments--a 
purposeful human will. it made the house alive in a strange, personal way of its own, so that in 
the minds of spectators five words ran dimly, without object or clear connection: "...in his 

image and likeness..."

a young photographer from the banner noticed howard roark standing alone across the 
street, at the parapet of the river. he was leaning back, his hands closed over the parapet, 
hatless, looking up at the building. it was an accidental, unconscious moment. the young 
photographer glanced at roark's face--and thought of something that had puzzled him for a 
long time: he had always wondered why the sensations one felt in dreams were so much 
more intense than anything one could experience in waking reality--why the horror was so 
total and the ecstasy

lain it, it had been just a path through some woods. he thought of 
that because he saw that extra quality for the first time in waking existence, he saw it in 
roark's face lifted to the building. the photographer was a young boy, new to his job; he did 
not know much about it; but he loved his work; he had been an amateur photographer since 
childhood. so he snapped a picture of roark in that one moment.

later the art editor of the banner saw the picture and barked: "what the hell's that?"

"howard roark," said the photographer. "who's howard roark?"

"the architect."

"who the hell wants a picture of the architect?"

"well, i only thought..."

"besides, it's crazy. what's the matter with the man?" so the picture was thrown into the 
morgue.

the enright house rented promptly. the tenants who moved in were people who wanted to 
live in sane comfort and cared about nothing else. they did not discuss the value of the 
building; they merely liked living there. they were the sort who lead useful, a

"yes, indeed."

"you don't want one of those satin-lined commercial boys with the dollar sign all over them. 
you want a man who believes in his work as--as you believe in god."

"that's right. that's absolutely right."

"you must take the one i name."

"certainly. who's that?"

"howard roark."

"huh?" hopton stoddard looked blank. "who's he?"

"he's the man who's going to build the temple of the human spirit."

"is he any good?"

ellsworth toohey turned and looked straight into his eyes.

"by my immortal soul, hopton," he said slowly, "he's the best there is."

"oh!..."

"but he's difficult to get. he doesn't work except on certain conditions. you must observe them 
scrupulously. you must give him complete freedom. tell him what you want and how much

"all right. now you've never dealt with architects, and he's an unusual kind of architect, and 
you don't want to muff it. so i'll tell you exactly what you're to say to him."

on the following day toohey walked into dominique's office. he stood at her desk, smiled and 
said, his voice unsmiling:

"do you remember hopton stoddard and that temple of all faith that he's been talking about 
for six years?"

"vaguely."

"he's going to build it."

"is he?"

"he's giving the job to howard roark."

"not really!"

"really."

"well, of all the incredible...not hopton!"

"hopton."

"oh, all right. i'll go to work on him."

"no. you lay off. i told him to give it to roark."

she sat still, exactly as the words caught her, the amusement gone from her face. he added:

"i wanted you to know that i did it, so there won't be any tactical contradictions. no one else 
knows it or is to know it. i trust you to remember that."

she asked, her lips moving tightly: "what are you after?"

side of a narrow entrance. a slatternly landlady said: "mallory? fifth floor rear," and shuffled 
away indifferently. roark climbed sagging wooden stairs lighted by bulbs stuck in a web of 
pipes. he knocked at a grimy door.

the door opened. a gaunt young man stood on the threshold; he had disheveled hair, a 
strong mouth with a square lower lip, and the most expressive eyes that roark had ever seen. 
"what do you want?" he snapped. "mr. mallory?"

"yeah."

"i'm howard roark."

mallory laughed, leaning against the doorjamb, one arm stretched across the opening, with no 
intention of stepping aside. he was obviously drunk. "well, well!" he said. "in person."

"may i come in?"

"what for?"

roark sat down on the stair banister. "why didn't you keep your appointment?"

"oh, the appointment? oh, yes. well, i'll tell you," mallory said gravely. "it was like this: i really 
intended to keep it, i really did, and i started out for your office, but on my way there i passed

but his eyes were studying roark intently, and his eyes had the certainty of a professional. as 
he spoke, his voice kept losing its swaggering gaiety, and it slipped to a dead flatness on the 
last sentences.

"no," said roark, "not this time."

the boy stood looking at him silently.

"you're howard roark?" he asked. "i like your buildings. that's why i didn't want to meet you. 
so i wouldn't have to be sick every time i looked at them. i wanted to go on thinking that they 
had to be done by somebody who matched them."

"what if i do?"

"that doesn't happen."

sensitive scale weighing roark's features, impertinent in its open action of appraisal.

the opening of the stoddard temple was announced for the afternoon of november first.

the press agent had done a good job. people talked about the event, about howard roark, 
about the architectural masterpiece which the city was to expect.

on the morning of october 31 hopton stoddard returned from his journey around the world. 
ellsworth toohey met him at the pier.

on the morning of november 1 hopton stoddard issued a brief statement announcing that 
there would be no opening. no explanation was given.

on the morning of november 2 the new york banner came out with the column "one small 
voice" by ellsworth m. toohey subtitled "sacrilege." it read as follows:

on november 3 hopton stoddard filed suit against howard roark for breach of contract and 
malpractice, asking damages; he asked a sum sufficient to have the temple altered by

on the following day "sacrilege" appeared in the banner and set the fuse. the announcement 
of stoddard's suit lighted it.

nobody would have felt an urge to crusade about a building; but religion had been attacked; 
the press agent had prepared the ground too well, the spring of public attention was wound, a 
great many people could make use of it.

the clamor of indignation that rose against howard roark and his temple astonished 
everyone, except ellsworth toohey. ministers damned the building in sermons. women's 
clubs passed resolutions of protest. a committee of mothers made page eight of the 
newspapers, with a petition that shrieked something about the protection of their children. a 
famous actress wrote an article on the essential unity of all the arts, explained that the 
stoddard temple had no sense of structural diction, and spoke of the time when she had 
played mary magdalene in a

public while awaiting the trial of his suit. the temple attracted crowds of people who left 
obscene drawings and inscriptions on the pedestal of dominique's statue.

there were a few who came, and saw, and admired the building in silence. but they were the 
kind who do not take part in public issues. austen heller wrote a furious article in defense of 
roark and of the temple. but he was not an authority on architecture or religion, and the 
article was drowned in the storm.

howard roark did nothing.

he was asked for a statement, and he received a group of reporters in his office. he spoke 
without anger. he said: "i can't tell anyone anything about my building. if i prepared a hash of 
words to stuff into other people's brains, it would be an insult to them and to me. but i am glad 
you came here. i do have something to say. i want to ask every man who is interested in this

proletarian art' tried to enlist in support of howard roark--they said he was a victim of 
capitalism--when they should have known that hopton stoddard is their champion. roark, by

"yes. i will testify for the plaintiff."

the case of hopton stoddard versus howard roark opened in february of 1931.

the courtroom was so full that mass reactions could be expressed only by a slow motion 
running across the spread of heads, a sluggish wave like the ripple under the tight-packed 
skin of a sea lion.

the crowd, brown and streaked with subdued color, looked like a fruitcake of all the arts, with 
the cream of the a.g.a. rich and heavy on top. there were distinguished men and well-
dressed, tight-lipped women; each woman seemed to feel an exclusive proprietorship of

"mr. toohey understood the issue so well. shall i clarify it--in my own words?"

"by all means."

"howard roark built a temple to the human spirit. he saw man as strong, proud, clean, wise 
and fearless. he saw man as a heroic being. and he built a temple to that. a temple is a place 
where man is to experience exaltation. he thought that exaltation comes from the 
consciousness of being guiltless, of seeing the truth and achieving it, of living up to one's 
highest possibility, of knowing no shame and having no cause for shame, of being able to 
stand naked in full sunlight. he thought that exaltation m

howard roark thought of man and of exaltation. but ellsworth toohey said that this temple 
was a monument to a profound hatred of humanity. ellsworth toohey said that the essence of 
exaltation was to be scared out of your wits, to fall down and to grovel. ellsworth toohey said

was to glorify the gross pleasure of the flesh, for the realm of the spirit is beyond the grasp of 
man. to enter that realm, said ellsworth toohey, man must come as a beggar, on his knees. 
ellsworth toohey is a lover of mankind."

"miss francon, we are not really discussing mr. toohey, so if you will confine yourself to..."

"i do not condemn ellsworth toohey. i condemn howard roark. a building, they say, must be 
part of its site. in what kind of world did roark build his temple? for what kind of men? look 
around you. can you see a shrine becoming sacred by serving as a setting for mr. hopton 
stoddard? for mr. ralston holcombe? for mr. peter keating? when you look at them all, do 
you hate ellsworth toohey--or do you damn howard roark for the unspeakable indignity 
which he did commit? ellsworth toohey is right, that temple is a sacrilege, though not in the

of virtue. let us say that we are moles and we object to mountain peaks. or, perhaps, that we 
are lemmings, the animals who cannot help swimming out to self-destruction. i realize fully 
that at this moment i am as futile as howard roark. this is my stoddard temple--my first and 
my last." she inclined her head to the judge. "that is all, your honor."

"your witness," the attorney snapped to roark.

"no questions," said roark.

dominique left the stand.

the attorney bowed to the bench and said: "the plaintiff rests."

the judge turned to roark and made a vague gesture, inviting him to proceed.

roark got up and walked to the bench, the brown envelope in hand. he took out of the 
envelope ten photographs of the stoddard temple

 in the manner of life it demands. not halfway, 
but completely. not pleading and running from it, but walking out to meet it, beating it to the 
pain and the ugliness, being first to choose the worst it can do to me. not as the wife of some 
half-decent human being, but as the wife of peter keating. and only within my own mind, only 
where nothing can touch it, kept sacred by the protecting wall of my own degradation, there 
will be the thought of you and the knowledge of you, and i shall say 'howard roark to myself 
once in a while, and i shall feel that i have deserved to say it." she stood before him, her face 
raised; her lips were not drawn, but closed softly, yet the shape of her mouth was too definite 
on her face, a shape of pain and tenderness, and resignation.

in his face she saw suffering that was made old, as if it had been part of him for a long time, 
because it was accepted, and it looked not like a wound, but like a scar.

when he lay in the darkness beside her, his desire satisfied and left hungrier than ever by the 
unmoving body that had not responded, not even in revulsion, when he felt defeated in the 
one act of mastery he had hoped to impose upon her, his first whispered words were: "god 
damn you!"

he heard no movement from her.

then he remembered the discovery which the moments of passion had wiped off his mind.

"who was he?" he asked.

"howard roark," she answered.

"all right," he snapped, "you don't have to tell me if you don't want to!"

he switched on the light. he saw her lying still, naked, her head thrown back. her face looked 
peaceful, innocent, clean. she said to the ceiling, her voice gentle: "peter, if i could do this...i 
can do anything now...."

"if you think i'm going to bother you often, if that's your idea of..."

"who is the man you hated, peter?"

"it doesn't matter."

she said nothing for a long time. then she put her hand on his hair. the gesture had the form 
of gentleness.

"i never wanted to take a revenge on you, peter," she said softly.

"then--why?"

"i married you for my own reasons. i acted as the world demands one should act. only i can

"quite correct, ellsworth."

"all of it? even the part about a man you loved--if you did?"

"yes."

"you wouldn't sell yourself for roark? though, of course, you don't like to hear that name 
pronounced."

"howard roark," she said evenly.

"you have a great deal of courage, dominique."

keating returned, carrying a tray of cocktails. his eyes were feverish and he made too many 
gestures.

toohey raised his glass. he said:

"to gail wynand and the new york banner!"

gail wynand rose and met her halfway across his office.

"how do you do, mrs. keating," he said.

"how do you do, mr. wynand," said dominique.

he moved a chair for her, but when she sat down he did not cross to sit behind his desk, he

the rail; as if she had taken hold of some reins, carelessly, because the occasion required no 
earnest effort any longer.

she remembered the stoddard temple. she thought of the man before her, who spoke about 
the total passion for the total height and about protecting skyscrapers with his body--and she 
saw a picture on a page of the new york banner, the picture of howard roark looking up at 
the enright house, and the caption: "are you happy, mr. superman?"

she raised her face to him. she asked:

"to marry you? to become mrs. wynand-papers?"

she heard the effort in his voice as he answered: "if you wish to call it that--yes."

"i will marry you."

"thank you, dominique."

she waited indifferently.

when he turned to her, he spoke as he had spoken all day, a calm voice with an edge of 
gaiety.

she reached over and took the cablegram off her mirror. she crumpled it, her fingers twisting 
slowly in a grinding motion against her palm. he stood listening to the crackle of the paper. 
she leaned forward, opened her hand over the wastebasket, and let the paper drop. her hand 
remained still for a moment, the fingers extended, slanting down, as they had opened.

the leaves streamed down, trembling in the sun. they were not green; only a few, 
scattered through the torrent, stood out in single drops of a green so bright and pure that it 
hurt the eyes; the rest were not a color, but a light, the substance of fire on metal, living sparks

this color, this green rising in small bubbles, the condensed essence of spring. the trees met,

boy knew suddenly that they felt the same thing, and he could speak as he would not speak to 
a stranger anywhere else.

"that isn't real, is it?" the boy asked, pointing down.

"why, yes, it is, now," the man answered.

"it's not a movie set or a trick of some kind?"

"no. it's a summer resort. it's just been completed. it will be opened in a few weeks."

"who built it?"

"i did."

"what's your name?"

"howard roark."

"thank you," said the boy. he knew that the steady eyes looking at him understood everything 
these two words had to cover. howard roark inclined his head, in acknowledgment.

wheeling his bicycle by his side, the boy took the narrow path down the slope of the hill to the 
valley and the houses below. roark looked after him. he had never seen that boy before and 
he would never see him again. he did not know that he had given someone the courage to 
face a lifetime.

own artists, engineers and newspapermen and 
factory workers. suddenly, spontaneously, people were talking about monadnock valley. 
there was a need for that kind of a resort, a need no one had tried to satisfy. the place 
became news, but it was private news; the papers had not discovered it. mr. bradley had no 
press agents; mr. bradley and his company had vanished from public life. one magazine, 
unsolicited, printed four pages of photographs of monadnock valley, and sent a man to 
interview howard roark. by the end of summer the houses were leased in advance for the 
following year. in october, early one morning, the door of roark's reception room flew open 
and steven mallory rushed in, making straight for roark's office. the secretary tried to stop 
him; roark was working and no interruptions were allowed. but mallory shoved her aside and 
tore into the office, slamming the door behind. she noticed that he held a newspaper in his 
hand.

roark glanced up at him, from the drafting table, and

 a trial, a few gentlemen sentenced to the penitentiary, and a new management 
taking monadnock over for the shareholders. roark was not involved. he was busy, and he 
forgot to read the accounts of the trial in the papers. mr. bradley admitted--in apology to his 
partners--that he would be damned if he could have expected a resort built on a crazy, 
unsociable plan ever to become successful. "i did all i could--i chose the worst fool i could 

find."

then austen heller wrote an article about howard roark and monadnock valley. he spoke of 
all the buildings roark had designed, and he put into words the things roark had said in 
structure. only they were not austen heller's usual quiet words--they were a ferocious cry of 
admiration and of anger. "and may we be damned if greatness must reach us through fraud!"

the article started a violent controversy in art circles.

"howard," mallory said one day, some months later, "you're famous."

"yes," said roark, "i suppose so."

"three-quarters of them

e year after 
monadnock valley roark built two private homes in connecticut, a movie theater in chicago, 
a hotel in philadelphia.

in the spring of 1936 a western city completed plans for a world's fair to be held next year, an 
international exposition to be known as "the march of the centuries." the committee of 
distinguished civic leaders in charge of the project chose a council of the country's best 
architects to design the fair. the civic leaders wished to be conspicuously progressive. 
howard roark was one of the eight architects chosen.

when he received the invitation, roark appeared before the committee and explained that he 
would be glad to design the fair--alone.

"but you can't be serious, mr. roark," the chairman declared. "after all, with a stupendous 
undertaking of this nature, we want the best that can be had. i mean, two heads are better 
than one, you know, and eight heads...why, you can see for yourself--the best talents of the 
country, the brightest names--you know, frien

collectives. i don't consult, i don't cooperate, i don't collaborate."

there was a great deal of angry comment on roark's refusal, in architectural circles. people 
said: "the conceited bastard!" the indignation was too sharp and raw for a mere piece of 
professional gossip; each man took it as a personal insult; each felt himself qualified to alter, 
advise and improve the work of any man living.

"the incident illustrates to perfection," wrote ellsworth toohey, "the antisocial nature of mr. 
howard roark's egotism, the arrogance of the unbridled individualism which he has always 
personified."

among the eight chosen to design "the march of the centuries" were peter keating, gordon 
l. prescott, ralston holcombe. "i won't work with howard roark," said peter keating, when 
he saw the list of the council, "you'll have to choose. it's he or i." he was informed that mr. 
roark had declined. keating assumed leadership over the council. the press stories about 
the progress of the fair's construction

a sharp, intractable manner in the last few years. he snapped orders 
and lost his patience before the smallest difficulty; when he lost his patience, he screamed at 
people: he had a vocabulary of insults that carried a caustic, insidious, almost feminine 
malice; his face was sullen.

in the fall of 1936 roark moved his office to the top floor of the cord building. he had thought 
when he designed that building, that it would be the place of his office some day. when he 
saw the inscription: "howard roark, architect," on his new door, he stopped for a moment; 
then he walked into the office. his own room, at the end of a long suite, had three walls of 
glass, high over the city. he stopped in the middle of the room. through the broad panes, he 
could see the fargo store, the enright house, the aquitania hotel. he walked to the windows 
facing south and stood there for a long time. at the tip of manhattan, far in the distance, he 
could see the dana building by henry cameron.

rhythm in their sound. drops of red and green light flashed on a wall board, signaling the 
progress of cars high in space.

it looked as if everything in that building were run by such control boards in the hands of an 
authority aware of every motion, as if the building were flowing with channeled energy, 
functioning smoothly, soundlessly, a magnificent machine that nothing could destroy. nobody 
paid any attention to the redheaded man who stopped in the lobby for a moment.

howard roark looked up at the tiled vault. he had never hated anyone. somewhere in this 
building was its owner, the man who had made him feel his nearest approach to hatred.

gail wynand glanced at the small clock on his desk. in a few minutes he had an appointment 
with an architect. the interview, he thought, would not be difficult; he had held many such 
interviews in his life; he merely had to speak, he knew what he wanted to say, and nothing 
was required of the architect except a few sounds signifyin

g understanding.

his glance went from the clock back to the sheets of proofs on his desk. he read an editorial 
by alvah scarret on the public feeding of squirrels in central park, and a column by ellsworth 
toohey on the great merits of an exhibition of paintings done by the workers of the city 
department of sanitation. a buzzer rang on his desk, and his secretary's voice said: "mr. 
howard roark, mr. wynand."

"okay," said wynand, flicking the switch off. as his hand moved back, he noticed the row of 
buttons at the edge of his desk, bright little knobs with a color code of their own, each 
representing the end of a wire that stretched to some part of the building, each wire controlling 
some man, each man controlling many men under his orders, each group of men contributing 
to the final shape of words on paper to go into millions of homes, into millions of human 
brains--these little

e man behind the desk; perhaps there had been no break in his steps and it only 
seemed to him that he had stopped. but there had been a moment when both forgot the terms
of immediate reality, when wynand forgot his purpose in summoning this man, when roark 
forgot that this man was dominique's husband, when no door, desk or stretch of carpet 
existed, only the total awareness, for each, of the man before him, only two thoughts meeting 
in the middle of the room--"this is gail wynand"--"this is howard roark."

then wynand rose, his hand motioned in simple invitation to the chair beside his desk, roark 
approached and sat down, and they did not notice that they had not greeted each other.

wynand smiled, and said what he had never intended to say. he said very simply:

"i don't think you'll want to work for me."

"i want to work for you," said roark, who had come here prepared to refuse.

"have you seen the kind of things i've built?"

"yes."

wynand smiled. "this is different. it's not for my publ

laughed aloud. "what a thing to say in what a place! i don't think you have any idea 
how your fellow architects would have conducted this interview. i don't believe you were 

actually conscious at any time that you were speaking to gail wynand."

"i was," said roark.

"this was my way of thanking you. i don't always like being gail wynand."

"i know that."

"i'm going to change my mind and ask you a personal question. you said you'd answer 
anything."

"i will."

"have you always liked being howard roark?"

roark smiled. the smile was amused, astonished, involuntarily contemptuous.

"you've answered," said wynand.

then he rose and said: "nine o'clock tomorrow morning," extending his hand.

when roark had gone, wynand sat behind his desk, smiling. he moved his hand toward one 
of the plastic buttons--and stopped. he realized that he had to assume a different manner, his 
usual manner, that he could not speak as he had spoken in the last half-hour. then he 
understood what had been strange about
 
 ___________________________
 
 the interview: for the first time in his life he had 
spoken to a man without feeling the reluctance, the sense of pressure, the need of disguise 
he had always experienced when he spoke to people; there had been no strain and no need 
of strain; as if he had spoken to himself.

he pressed the button and said to his secretary:

"tell the morgue to send me everything they have on howard roark."

"guess what," said alvah scarret, his voice begging to be begged for his information.

ellsworth toohey waved a hand impatiently in a brushing-off motion, not raising his eyes from 
his desk.

"go 'way, alvah. i'm busy."

"no, but this is interesting, ellsworth. really, it's interesting. i know you'll want to know."

toohey lifted his head and looked at him, the faint contraction of boredom in the corners of his 
eyes letting scarret understand that this moment of attention was a favor; he

"ellsworth, your private f.b.i. is slipping."

"bet you don't know what gail's been doing--and you always make such a point of keeping

"what don't i know?"

"guess who was in his office today."

"my dear alvah, i have no time for quiz games."

"you wouldn't guess in a thousand years."

"very well, since the only way to get rid of you is to play the vaudeville stooge, i shall ask the 
proper question: who was in dear gail's office today?"

"howard roark."

toohey turned to him full face, forgetting to dole out his attention, and said incredulously:

"no!"

"yes!" said scarret, proud of the effect.

"well!" said toohey and burst out laughing.

scarret half smiled tentatively, puzzled, anxious to join in, but not quite certain of the cause for 
amusement.

"yes, it's funny. but...just exactly why, ellsworth?"

"oh, alvah, it would take so long to tell you!"

"i had an idea it might..."

"what is this, alvah? are you telling me things i don't know, or is this just in the nature of

"i guess so. i don't like to knock gail, but i've been so damn mad for so long i'm fit to be tied.

"i could write a volume on that, alvah. this is hardly the time to launch into such an

would be less terrible; this drawing, more personal than roark's body, created in answer to a 
matching force that came from gail wynand, was a violation of her, of roark, of wynand--and 
yet, she knew suddenly that it was the inevitable.

"no," she whispered, "things like that are never a coincidence."

"what?"

but she held up her hand, softly pushing back all conversation, and she walked to the 
drawing, her steps soundless on the carpet. she saw the sharp signature in the 
corner--"howard roark." it was less terrifying than the shape of the house; it was a thin point 
of support, almost a greeting.

"dominique?"

she turned her face to him. he saw her answer. he said:

"i knew you'd like it. forgive the inadequacy. we're stuck for words tonight."

she walked to the davenport and sat down; she let her back press against the cushions; it 
helped to sit straight. she kept her eyes on wynand. he stood before her, leaning on the 
mantelpiece, half turned away, looking at the drawing. she

"you knew him all this time?...every evening...when you came home...at the dinner table..."

"howard roark."

she had wanted to hear the name pronounced by gail wynand.

"how did you happen to choose him, gail?"

"i looked all over the country. every building i liked had been done by him."

she nodded slowly.

"dominique, i take it for granted you don't care about it any more, but i know that i picked the 
one architect you spent all your time denouncing when you were on the banner."

wynand spoke about the newspaper business; he showed no reluctance to discuss it with 
roark, and she pronounced a few sentences when it seemed necessary. her voice had a 
luminous simplicity; she was being carried along, unresisting, any personal reaction would be 
superfluous, even pain or fear. she thought, if in the flow of conversation wynand's next

he dialed the number. roark moved to the door of the drafting room--he had orders to give

"hello, dominique?...yes....tired?...no, you just sounded like it....i won't be home for dinner,

in the library of the penthouse dominique stood with her hand on the telephone, as if some 
connection still remained.

for five days and nights, she had fought a single desire--to go to him. to see him alone--
anywhere--his home or his office or the street--for one word or only one glance--but alone. 
she could not go. her share of action was ended. he would come to her when he wish

gail wynand sat at his desk in his office and read the proofs of an editorial on the moral 
value of raising large families. sentences like used chewing gum, chewed and rechewed, spat

pages, thinking of howard roark.

he signed the advertising contract with kream-o pudding--for five years, on the entire 
wynand chain, two full pages in every paper every sunday. the men before his desk sat like 
triumphal arches in flesh, monuments to victory, to evenings of patience and calculation, 
restaurant tables, glasses emptied into throats, months of thought, his energy, his living 
energy flowing like the liquid in the glasses into the opening of heavy lips, into stubby fingers, 
across a desk, into two full pages

keating's mind was a bruise. he thought it would be a bruise, because it felt as if something 
flat and heavy had smashed against it, and it would be black and blue and swollen later; now 
he felt nothing except a sweetish numbness. such chips of thought as he could distinguish

and while his sole hope of grace rested in toohey, something inexplicable twisted within him, 
he leaned forward, knowing that this would hurt, wishing it to hurt toohey, and his lips curled 
incredibly into a smile, baring his teeth and gums:

"you failed there, didn't you, ellsworth? look where he is now--howard roark."

"oh dear me, how dull it is to discuss things with minds devoted to the obvious. you are utterly 
incapable of grasping principles, peter. you think only in terms of persons. do you really

"ellsworth, i don't know what you're talking about."

"but of course you don't. that's my advantage i say these things publicly every single day--and
nobody knows what i'm talking about."

"have you heard that howard roark is doing a house, his own home, for gail wynand?"

"my dear peter, did you think i had to wait to learn it from you?"

"well, how do you like that?"

"why should it concern me one way or another?"

"have you heard that roark and wynand are the best of friends? and what friendship, from 
what i hear! well? you know what wynand can do. you know what he can make of roark.

"you know damn well what i mean. do you think i picked the things in my art gallery by their 
signatures? if peter keating designed this, i'll eat every copy of today's banner."

"peter keating designed this, gail."

"you fool. what are you after?"

"if i don't want to understand what you're talking about, i won't understand it, no matter what 
you say."

"oh, you might, if i run a story to the effect that a certain housing project was designed by 
howard roark, which would make a swell exclusive story and a joke on one mr. toohey who's 
the boy behind the boys on most of those damn projects."

"you publish that and i'll sue hell out of you."

"you really would?"

"i would. drop it, gail. don't you see i don't want to discuss it?"

later, wynand showed the picture to dominique and asked:

"who designed this?"

she looked at it. "of course," was all she answered.

i ought to fire alvah, he thought--and then laughed at himself, aghast: fire alvah scarret?--one 
might as well think of stopping the earth--or--of the unthinkable--of closing the banner.

but through the months of that summer and fall, there were days when he loved the banner. 
then he sat at this desk, with his hand on the pages spread before him, fresh ink smearing 
his palm, and he smiled as he saw the name of howard roark in the pages of the banner.

the word had come down from his office to every department concerned: plug howard roark. 
in the art section, the real-estate section, the editorials, the columns, mentions of roark and 
his buildings began to appear regularly. there were not many occasions when one could give 
publicity to an architect, and buildings had little news value, but the banner managed to throw 
roark's name at the public under every kind of ingenious pretext. wynand edited every word

it had stopped raining, but peter keating wished it would start again. the pavements 
glistened, there were dark blotches on the walls of buildings, and since it did not come from

darkness, disquieting like premature old ag

the same way.

"next time you want to play the innocent bystander, let me coach you."

"they believe it though, don't they?"

"oh yes, they believe it. they have to. you almost died. i don't see why he had to save the 
watchman's life and almost take yours."

"howard, my dear. howard roark."

"what has he to do with it?"

"darling, you're not being questioned by the police. you will be, though, and you'll have to be 
more convincing than that. however, i'm sure you'll succeed. they won't think of the stoddard

waiting for you downstairs. he's been here every day."

"who?"

"your lover. howard roark. want to let him thank you now?"

the gay mockery, the tone of uttering the most preposterous thing he could think of, told her 
how far he was from guessing the rest. she said:

"yes. i want to see him. gail, if i decide to make him my lover?"

"i'll kill you both. now don't move, lie flat, the doctor said you must take it easy, you've got

regret that the laws of our state allow nothing more than a prison sentence for this crime. that 
man should forfeit his life. society needs the right to rid itself of men such as howard roark."

thus spoke ellsworth m. toohey in the pages of the new frontiers.

echoes answered him from all over the country. the explosion of cortlandt had lasted half a 
minute. the explosion of public fury went on and on, with a cloud of powdered plaster filling 
the air, with rust and refuse raining out of the cloud.

roark had been indicted by a grand jury, had pleaded "not guilty" and had refused to make 
any other statement. he had been released on a bond furnished by gail wynand, and he

gail wynand went against the current.

"gail!" alvah scarret had gasped. "we can't defend a dynamiter!"

"keep still, alvah," wynand had said, "before i bash your teeth in."

gail wynand stood alone in the middle of his office, his head thrown back, glad to be living, as 
he had stood on a wharf on a dark night facing the lights of a city.

"in the filthy howling now going on all around us," said an editorial in the banner, signed "gail 
wynand" in big letters, "nobody seems to remember that howard roark surrendered himself 
of his own free will. if he blew up that building--did he have to remain at the scene to be 
arrested? but we don't wait to discover his reasons. we have convicted him without a hearing. 
we want him to be guilty. we are delighted with this case. what you hear is not indignation--

simply because he is weak and small. to what level of depravity has a society descended 
when it condemns a man simply because he is strong and great? such, however, is the whole 
moral atmosphere of our century--the century of the second-rater."

"we hear it shouted," said another wynand editorial, "that howard roark spends his career in 
and out of courtrooms. well, that is true. a man like roark is on trial before society all his life. 
whom does that indict--roark or society?"

"we have never made an effort to understand what is greatness in man and how to recognize 
it," said another wynand editorial. "we have come to hold, in a kind of mawkish stupor, that 
greatness is to be gauged by self-sacrifice. self-sacrifice, we drool, is the ultimate virtue. let's

"dominique, which will be worse for him--to lose you or to lose his crusade?" she nodded, 
understanding. he added: "you know that it's not me he wants to save. i'm only the excuse."

she lifted her hand. she touched his cheekbone, a faint pressure of her fingertips. she could 
allow herself nothing else. she turned and went on to her bedroom, and heard him closing the 
guestroom door.

"is it not appropriate," wrote lancelot clokey in a syndicated article, "that howard roark is 
being defended by the wynand papers? if anyone doubts the moral issues involved in this 
appalling case, here is the proof of what's what and who stands where. the wynand papers--

to public taste and decency, that intellectual underworld ruled by a man who has less

she felt as if the sunlight went straight through her, because her body had no weight.

but she had to hurry before he awakened. she found his pyjamas in a dresser drawer and put 
them on. she went to the living room, closing the door carefully behind her. she picked up the 
telephone and asked for the nearest sheriff's office.

"this is mrs. gail wynand," she said. "i am speaking from the house of mr. howard roark at

she went to the kitchen, made coffee and stood watching the glow of the electric coil under 
the coffee pot, thinking that it was the most beautiful light on earth.

she set the table by the large window in the living room. he came out, wearing nothing but a

a tree branch hung in the open window. the leaves moved against the sky, implying sun

background. wynand thought of two hands bending a tree branch to explain the meaning of 
life. the leaves drooped, touching the spires of new york's skyline far across the river. the 
skyscrapers stood like shafts of sunlight, washed white by distance and summer. a crowd 
filled the county courtroom, witnessing the trial of howard roark.

roark sat at the defense table. he listened calmly.

dominique sat in the third row of spectators. looking at her, people felt as if they had seen a 
smile. she did not smile. she looked at the leaves in the window.

gail wynand sat at the back of the courtroom. he had come in, alone, when the room was 
full. he had not noticed the stares and the flashbulbs exploding around him. he had stood in 
the aisle for a moment, surveying the place as if there were no reason why he should not

this concluded the first day of the trial.

peter keating was the first witness called on the following day.

he sat on the stand, slumped forward. he looked at the prosecutor obediently. his eyes 
moved, once in a while. he looked at the crowd, at the jury, at roark. it made no difference.

"mr. keating, will you state under oath whether you designed the project ascribed to you, 
known as cortlandt homes?"

"no. i didn't."

"who designed it?"

"howard roark."

"at whose request?"

"at my request."

"why did you call on him?"

"because i was not capable of doing it myself."

there was no sound of honesty in the voice, because there was no sound of effort to 
pronounce a truth of such nature; no tone of truth or falsehood; only indifference.

the prosecutor handed him a sheet of paper. "is this the agreement you signed?"

keating held the paper in his hand. "yes."

"is that howard roark's signature?"

"yes."

"will you please read the terms of this

interrupted, he would not be able to pick up the next sentence, but would have to start all over 
again from the beginning.

he answered a great many questions. the prosecutor introduced in evidence roark's original 
drawings of cortlandt, which keating had kept; the copies which keating had made of them; 
and photographs of cortlandt as it had been built.

"why did you object so strenuously to the excellent structural changes suggested by mr. 
prescott and mr. webb?"

"i was afraid of howard roark."

"what did your knowledge of his character lead you to expect?'

"anything."

"what do you mean?"

"i don't know. i was afraid. i used to be afraid."

the questions went on. the story was unusual, but the audience felt bored. it did not sound 
like the recital of a participant. the other witnesses had seemed to have a more personal 
connection with the case.

when keating left the stand, the audience had the odd impression that no change had 
occurred in the act of a man's exit; as if no per

went to dominique, then to wynand. he turned and followed the bailiff.

he had reached the door when there was a sharp crack of sound, and a space of blank 
silence before people realized that it was a knock at the closed door of the jury room. the jury 
had reached a verdict.

those who had been on their feet remained standing, frozen, until the judge returned to the 
bench. the jury filed into the courtroom.

"the prisoner will rise and face the jury," said the clerk of the court.

howard roark stepped forward and stood facing the jury. at the back of the room, gail 
wynand got up and stood also.

"mr. foreman, have you reached a verdict?"

"we have."

"what is your verdict?"

"not guilty."

the first movement of roark's head was not to look at the city in the window, at the judge or 
at dominique. he looked at wynand.

wynand turned sharply and walked out. he was the first man to leave the courtroom.

he ordered every twisted remnant of foundations dug out to leave a clean hole in the earth. 
he hired howard roark to rebuild the project. placing a single contractor in charge, observing 
the strict economy of the plans, enright budgeted the undertaking to set low rentals with a 
comfortable margin of profit for himself. no questions were to be asked about the income, 
occupation, children or diet of the future tenants; the project was open to anyone who wished 
to move in and pay the rent, whether he could afford a more expensive apartment elsewhere 
or not.

dishonored, granting him lawful sympathy, the status of injured innocence, and a paper that 
was his passport to freedom for all the years before him, and for all the silent evenings of 
those years.

ellsworth toohey won his case before the labor board. wynand was ordered to reinstate him

as if she were hearing it: "and i know that if you carry these words through to the end, it will be 
a victory, howard, not just for you, but for something that should win, that moves the world--
and never wins acknowledgment. it will vindicate so many who have fallen before you, who 
have suffered as you will suffer."

she saw, on the fence surrounding new york's greatest building, a small tin plate bearing the 
words:
#

"howard roark, architect"

she walked to the superintendent's shed. she had come here often to call for roark, to watch 
the progress of construction. but there was a new man in the shed who did not know her. she 
asked for roark.

"mr. roark is way up on top by the water tank. who's calling, ma'am?"

"mrs. roark," she answered.

the man found the superintendent who let her ride the outside hoist, as she always did--a few 
planks with a rope for a railing, that rose up the side of the building.

she saw him standing above her, on the top platform of the wynand building. he waved to 
her.

the line of the ocean cut the sky. the ocean mounted as the city descended. she passed the

then there was only the ocean and the sky and the figure of howard roark.
