[prologue]

                enter the ghost of andrea, and with him revenge.

  ghost.  when this eternal substance of my soul
    did live imprison'd in my wanton flesh,
    each in their function serving others' need,
    i was a courtier in the spanish court:

    how likes don balthazar of this device?

  balt.  right well, my liege, if this proviso were:
    that don horatio bear us company,
    whom i admire and love for chivalry.

  king.  horatio, leave him not that loves thee so.
    now let us hence, to see our soldiers paid,
    and feast our prisoner as our friendly guest.

                  exeunt.



[act i.  scene 2.]

                [portugal:  the viceroy's palace.]

                enter viceroy, alexandro, villuppo.

  vice.  is our ambassador dispatch'd for spain?

  alex.  two days, my liege, are past since his depart.

  vice.  and tribute payment gone along with him?

  alex.  aye, my good lord.

  vice.  then rest we here a-while in our unrest;
    and feed our sorrows with inward sighs,
    for deepest cares break never into tears.
    but wherefore sit i in a regal throne?
    this better fits a wretch's endless moan.
    yet this is higher then my fortunes reach,
    and therefore better than my state deserves.

  bal.  signior horatio stoop'd in happy time!

  hor.  i reap'd more grace that i deserv'd or hop'd.

  lor.  my lord, be not dismay'd for what is past;
    you know that women oft are humorous:
    these clouds will overblow with little wind;
    let me alone, i'll scatter them myself.
    meanwhile let us devise to spend the time
    in some delightful sports and revelling.

  hor.  the king, my lords, is coming hither straight
    to feast the portingal ambassador;
    things were in readiness before i came.

  bal.  then here it fits us to attend the king,
    to welcome hither our ambassador,
    and learn my father and my country's health.

                enter the banquet, trumpets, the king,
                and ambassador.

  king.  see, lord ambassador, how spain entreats
    their prisoner balthazar, thy viceroy's son:
    we pleasure more in kindness than in wars.

  ambass.  sad is our king, and portingal laments,
    supposing that don balthaz

    was, as the rest, a valiant englishman,
    brave john of gaunt, the duke of lancaster,
    as by his scutcheon plainly may appear:
    he with a puissant army came to spain
    and took our king of castille prisoner.

  ambass.  this is an argument for our viceroy
    that spain may not insult for her success,
    since english warriors likewise conquer'd spain
    and made them bow their knees to albion.

  king.  hieronimo, i drink to thee for this device,
    which hath pleas'd both the ambassador and me:
    pledge me, hieronimo, if thou love the king!

                takes the cup of horatio.

    my lord, i fear we sit but over-long,
    unless our dainties were more delicate,--
    but welcome are you to the best we have.
    now let us in, that you may be dispatch'd;
    i think our council is already set.

                exeunt omnes.

                [chorus.]

  andrea.  come we for this from depth of under ground,--
    to see him feast that gave me my death's wound?
    these

kle at her breast,
    tell our delight and mirthful dalliance.
    till then, each hour will seem a year and more.

  hor.  but, honey-sweet and honourable love,
    return we now into your father's sight;
    dang'rous suspicion waits on our delight.

  lor.  aye, danger mix'd with jealous despite
    shall send thy soul into eternal night!

                exeunt.




[act ii.  scene 3.]

                [the spanish court.]

                enter the king of spain, portingal
                ambassador, don ciprian, &c.

  king.  brother of castille, to the prince's love
    what says your daughter bel-imperia?

  cip.  although she coy it, as becomes her kind,
    and yet dissemble that she loves the prince,
    i doubt not, aye, but she will stoop in time;
    and, were she froward,--which she will not be,--
    yet herein shall she follow my advice,
    which is to love him or forgo my love.

  king.  then, lord ambassador of portingal,
    advise thy king to make this marriage up
    for

lames,

                they bind him to the stake.

    that shall prefigure those unquenched fires
    of phlegethon prepared for his soul.

  alex.  my guiltless death will be aveng'd on thee!
    on thee, villuppo, that hath malice'd thus,
    or for thy meed hast falsely me accus'd!

  vil.  nay, alexandro, if thou menace me,
    i'll lend a hand to send thee to the lake
    where those thy words shall perish with thy works,
    injurious traitor, monstrous homicide!

                enter ambassador.

  ambass.  stay!  hold a-while!
    and here, with pardon of his majesty,
    lay hands upon villuppo!

  vice.                        ambassador,
   what news hath urg'd this sudden enterance?

  ambass.  know, sovereign lord, that balthazar doth live.

  vice.  what say'st thou?  liveth balthazar, our son?

  ambass.  your highness' son, lord balthazar doth live,
    and, well entreated in the court of spain,
    humbly commends him to your majesty.
    these eyes beheld; and these my follo

 myself, let's know
    who will revenge horatio's murther then!
    no, no; fie, no!  pardon me, i'll none of that:

                he flings away the dagger & halter.

    this way i'll take; and this way comes the king,

                he takes them up again.

    and here i'll have a fling at him, that's flat!
    and, balthazar, i'll be with thee to bring;
    and thee, lorenzo!  here's the king; nay, stay!
    and here,--aye, here,--there goes the hare away!

                enter king, ambassador, castille, and
                lorenzo.

  king.  now show, ambassador, what our viceroy saith:
    hath he receiv'd the articles we sent?

  hiero.  justice!  o, justice to hieronimo!

  lor.  back! see'st thou not the king is busy?

  hiero.  o!  is he so?

  king.  who is he that interrupts our business?

  hiero.  not i!  [aside] hieronimo, beware!  go by, go
    by!

  ambass.  renown'd king, he hath receiv'd and read
    thy kingly proffers and thy promis'd league,
    and, as a man extre

sons.
    but, gentle brother, go give to him this gold,
    the prince's ransom; let him have his due;
    for what he hath, horatio shall not want.
    haply hieronimo hath need thereof.

  lor.  but if he be thus helplessly distract,
    'tis requisite his office be resign'd
    and giv'n to one of more discretion.

  king.  we shall increase his melancholy so.
    'tis best that we see further in it first;
    till when, ourself will hold exempt the place.
    and, brother, now bring in the ambassador,
    that he may be a witness of the match
    'twixt balthazar and bel-imperia,
    and that we may prefix a certain time
    wherein the marriage shall be solemniz'd,
    that we may have thy lord the viceroy here.

  ambass.  therein your highness highly shall content
    his majesty, that longs to hear from hence.

  king.  on then, and hear you, lord ambassador.

                exeunt.

d lorenzo.

  bal.          how now, hieronimo?
    what, courting bel-imperia?

  hiero.                aye, my lord,
    such courting as, i promise you,
    she hath my heart, but you, my lord, have hers.

  lor.  but now, hieronimo, or never
    we are to entreat your help.

  hie.           my help?
   why, my good lords, assure yourselves of me;
    for you have giv'n me cause,--
    aye, by my faith, have you!

  bal.                         it pleased you
    at the entertainment of the ambassador,
    to grace the king so much as with a show;
    now were your study so well furnished
    as, for the passing of the first night's sport,
    to entertain my father with the like,
    or any such like pleasing motion,
    assure yourself it would content them well.

  hiero.  is this all?

  bal.  aye, this is all.

  hiero.  why then i'll fit you; say no more.
    when i was young i gave my mind
    and plied myself to fruitless poetry,
    which, though it profit the professor naught,
