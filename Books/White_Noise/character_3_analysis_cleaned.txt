[CHARACTER]

[CHARACTER] is a shadowy figure who makes a brief but
significant appearance at the end of the novel. long before he actually
appears in the text, we know of [CHARACTER] as mr. gray, the corrupt
project manager behind the drug dylar. mink has been carrying on
an affair with babette, who believes dylar can alleviate her overwhelming fear
of dying. [CHARACTER] is both the center of jack's jealous rage and
jack's only hope of getting dylar himself.
when [CHARACTER] finally does enter the story, he has
already become a pathetic, half-crazed figure. deranged and debilitated,
he personifies the corrupting influence of technological and media stimuli,
the novel's titular white noise. fixed in front of a soundless television,
muttering phrases from old shows and commercials, [CHARACTER] fills
the narrative with his own white noise, or babblings. for willie,
the distinctions between real and artificial have collapsed entirely,
and he can no longer differentiate between the two. [CHARACTER]
is the ultimate casualty of this world of simulations, where characters
live almost entirely under the illusions they create.
