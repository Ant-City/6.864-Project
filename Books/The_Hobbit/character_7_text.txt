"looking behind," said he. 
"exactly!" said thorin; "but could you be more plain?" 
"i went on to spy out our road. it will soon become dangerous and difficult. also i was 
anxious about replenishing our small stock of provisions. i had not gone very far, 
however, when i met a couple of friends of mine from rivendell." 
"where's that?" asked bilbo, 
"don't interrupt!" said gandalf. "you will get there in a few days now, if we're lucky, and 
find out all about it as i was saying i met two of elrond's people. they were hurrying 
along for fear of the trolls. it was they who told me that three of them had come down 
from the mountains and settled in the woods not far from the road; they had frightened 
everyone away from the district, and they waylaid strangers. 
"i immediately had a feeling that i was wanted back. looking behind i saw a fire in the 
distance and made for it. so now you know. please be more careful, next time, or we 
shall never get anywhere!" 
"thank you!" said thorin.

"we need food, for one thing, and rest in reasonable safetyalso it is very necessary to 
tackle the misty mountains by the proper path, or else you will get lost in them, and have 
to come back and start at the beginning again (if you ever get back at all)." 
they asked him where he was making for, and he answered: "you are come to the very 
edge of the wild, as some of you may know. hidden somewhere ahead of us is the fair 
valley of rivendell where elrond lives in the last homely house. i sent a message by 
my friends, and we are expected." 
that sounded nice and comforting, but they had not got there yet, and it was not so easy 
as it sounds to find the last homely house west of the mountains. there seemed to be 
no trees and no valleys and no hills to break the ground in front of them, only one vast 
slope going slowly up and up to meet the feet of the nearest mountain, a wide land the 
colour of heather and crumbling rock, with patches and sl

there is little to tell about their stay. 
the master of the house was an elf-friend-one of those people whose fathers came into 
the strange stories before the beginning of history, the wars of the evil goblins and the 
elves and the first men in the north. in those days of our tale there were still some 
people who had both elves and heroes of the north for ancestors, and elrond the master 
of the house was their chief. he was as noble and as fair in face as an elf-lord, as strong 
as a warrior, as wise as a wizard, as venerable as a king of dwarves, and as kind as 
summer. he comes into. many tales, but his part in the story of bilbo's great adventure is 
only a small one, though important, as you will see, if we ever get to the end of it. his 
house was perfect, whether you liked food, or sleep, or work, or story-telling, or singing, 
or just sitting and thinking bes

 or one or two of the songs that they 
heard in that house. all of them, the ponies as well, grew refreshed and strong in a few 
days there. their clothes were mended as well as their bruises, their tempers and their 
hopes. their bags were filled with food and provisions light to carry but strong to bring 
them over the mountain passes. their plans were improved with the best advice. so the 

time came to mid- summer eve, and they were to go on again with the early sun on 
midsummer morning. 
elrond knew all about runes of every kind. that day he looked at the swords they had 
brought from the trolls' lair, and he said: "these are not troll-make. they are old swords, 
very old swords of the high elves of the west, my kin. they were made in gondolin for 
the goblin-wars. they must have come from a dragon's hoard or goblin plunder, for 
dragons and goblins destroyed that city many ages ago. this, thorin, the runes name

them well!" 
"whence did the trolls get them, i wonder?" said thorin looking at his 
sword with new interest. 
"i could not say," said elrond, "but one may guess that your trolls had plundered other 
plunderers, or come on the remnants of old robberies in some hold in the mountains of 
the north. i have heard that there are still forgotten treasures of old to be found in the 
deserted caverns of the mines of moria, since the dwarf and goblin war." 
thorin pondered these words. "i will keep this sword in honour," he said. 
"may it soon cleave goblins once again!"

show me now your map!" he took it and gazed long at it, and he shook his head; for if he 
did not altogether approve of dwarves and their love of gold, he hated dragons and their 
cruel wickedness, and he grieved to remember the ruin of the town of dale and its merry 
bells, and the burned banks of the bright river running. the moon was shining in a 
broad silver crescent. he held up the map and the white light shone through it. "what is 
this?" he said. "there are moon-letters here, bes

"what are moon-letters?" asked the hobbit full of excitement. he loved maps, as i have 
told you before; and he also liked runes and letters and cunning handwriting, though 
when he wrote himself it was a bit thin and spidery. 
"moon-letters are rune-letters, but you cannot see them," said elrond, "not when you 
look straight at them. they can only be seen when the moon shines behind them, and 
what is more, with the more cunning sort it must be a moon of the same shape and 
season as the day when they were written. the dwarves invented them and wrote them 
with silver pens, as your friends could tell you. these must have been written on a 
midsummer's eve in a crescent moon, a long while ago." 
"what do they say?" asked gandalf and thorin together, a bit vexed perhaps that even

before, and there would not have been another until goodness knows when. 
"stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks," read elrond, "and the setting sun with 
the last light of durin's day will shine upon the key-hole." 
"durin, durin!" said thorin. "he was the father of the fathers of the eldest race of 
dwarves, the longbeards, and my first ancestor: i am his heir." 
"then what is durin's day?" asked elrond. 
"the first day of the dwarves' new year," said thorin, "is as all should know the first, day 
of the last moon of autumn on the threshold of winter. we still call it durin's day when 
the last moon of autumn and the sun are in the sky together. but this will not help us 
much, i fear, for it passes our skill in these days to guess when such a time will come 
again." 
"that remains to be seen," said gandalf. "is there any more writing?" 
"none to be seen by this moon," said elrond, and he gave

over hill and under hill 
 
there were many paths that led up into those mountains, and many passes over them. 
but most of the paths were cheats and deceptions and led nowhere or to bad ends; and 
most of the passes were infested by evil things and dreadful dangers. the dwarves and 
the hobbit, helped by the wise advice of elrond and the knowledge and memory of 
gandalf, took the right road to the right pass. 
long days after they had climbed out of the valley and left the last homely house miles 
behind, they were still going up and up and up. it was a hard path and a dangerous path, 
a crooked way and a lonely and a long. now they could look back over the lands they 
had left, laid out behind them far below. far, far away in the west, where things were 
blue and faint, bilbo knew there lay his own country of safe and

, and they 
did not dare to sing or talk too loud, for the echoes were uncanny, and the silence 
seemed to dislike being broken-except by the noise of water and the wail of wind and the 
crack of stone. 
"the summer is getting on down below," thought bilbo, "and haymaking is going on and 
picnics. they will be harvesting and blackberrying, before we even begin to go down the 
other side at this rate." and the others were thinking equally gloomy thoughts, although 
when they had said good-bye to elrond in the high hope of a midsummer morning, they' 
had spoken gaily of the passage of the mountains, and of riding swift across the lands 
beyond. they had thought of coming to the secret door in the lonely mountain, perhaps 
that very next first moon of autumn-" and perhaps it will be durin's day" they had said. 
only gandalf had shaken his head and said nothing. dwarves had not passed that way 
for many years, but gandalf had, and he knew how evil and danger had grown and 
thriven in the wild, s

ince the dragons had driven men from the lands, and the goblins 
had spread in secret after the battle of the mines of moria. even the good plans of wise 
wizards like gandalf and of good friends like elrond go astray sometimes when you are 
off on dangerous adventures over the edge of the wild; and gandalf was a wise enough 
wizard to know it. 
he knew that something unexpected might happen, and he hardly dared to hope that 
they would pass without fearful adventure over those great tall mountains with lonely 
peaks and valleys where no king ruled. they did not. all was well, until one day they met

ith poor little bilbo at the back and nearest to the whips) came running in, while the 
goblin-drivers whooped and cracked their whips behind. the ponies were already there 
huddled in a corner; and there were all the baggages and packages lying broken open, 
and being rummaged by goblins, and smelt by goblins, and fingered by goblins, and 
quarreled over by goblins. 
i am afraid that was the last they ever saw of those excellent little ponies, including a 
jolly sturdy little white fellow that elrond had lent to gandalf, since his horse was not 
suitable for the mountain-paths. for goblins eat horses and ponies and donkeys (and 
other much more dreadful things), and they are always hungry. just now however the 
prisoners were thinking only of themselves. the goblins chained their hands behind their 
backs and linked them all together in a line and dragged them to the far end of the 
cavern with little bilbo tugging at the end of the row.

e bilbo a queer look from under his bushy eyebrows, as he said this, and 
the hobbit wondered if he guessed at the part of his tale that he had left out. 
then he had questions of his own to ask, for if gandalf had explained it all by now to the 
dwarves, bilbo had not heard it. he wanted to know how the wizard had turned up again, 
and where they had all got to now. 
the wizard, to tell the truth, never minded explaining his cleverness more than once, so 
now he had told bilbo that both he and elrond had been well aware of the presence of 
evil goblins in that part of the mountains. but their main gate used to come out on a 
different pass, one more easy to travel by, so that they often caught people benighted 
near their gates. evidently people had given up going that way, and the goblins must 
have opened their new entrance at the top of the pass the dwarves had taken, quite 
recently, because it had been found quite safe up to now. 
"i must see if i can't find a more or less decent giant

ke the tables for the convenience of the wonderful 
animals that waited on him. what did the rest sit on? they were not forgotten. the other 
ponies came in rolling round drum-shaped sections of logs, smoothed and polished, and 
low enough even for bilbo; so soon they were all seated at beorn's table, and the hall 
had not seen such a gathering for many a year. 
there they had a supper, or a dinner, such as they had not had since they left the last 
homely house in the west and said good-bye to elrond. the light of the torches and the 
fire flickered about them, and on the table were two tall red beeswax candles. all the 
time they ate, beorn in his deep rolling voice told tales of the wild lands on this side of 
the mountains, and especially of the dark and dangerous wood, that lay outstretched far 
to north and south a day's ride before them, barring their way to the east, the terrible 
forest of mirkwood. 
the dwarves listened and shook their beards, for they knew that they must soon vent

e smoke," said the hobbit. 
"that does not prove it," said balin, "though i don't doubt you are right. but he might be 
gone away some time, or he might be lying out on the mountain-side keeping watch, and 
still i expect smokes and steams would come out of the gates: all the halls within must 
be filled with his foul reek." 
with such gloomy thoughts, followed ever by croaking crows above them, they made 
their weary way back to the camp. only in june they had been guests in the fair house 
of elrond, and though autumn was now crawling towards winter that pleasant time now 
seemed years ago. they were alone in the perilous waste without hope of further help. 
they were at the end of their journey, but as far as ever, it seemed, from the end of their 
quest. none of them had much spirit left. 
now strange to say mr. baggins had more than the others. he would often borrow 
thorin's map and gaze at it, pondering over the runes and the message of the moon-
letters elrond had read. it was he tha

then the elves of the valley came out and greeted them and led them across the water 
to the house of elrond. there a warm welcome was made them, and there were many 
eager ears that evening to hear the tale of their adventures. gandalf it was who spoke, 
for bilbo was fallen quiet and drowsy. 
most of the tale he knew, for he had been in it, and had himself told much of it to the 
wizard on their homeward way or in the house of beorn; but every now and again he 
would open one eye, and listen, when a part of the story which he did not yet know came 
in. it was in this way that he learned where gandal

f had been to; for he overheard the 
words of the wizard to elrond. it appeared that gandalf had been to a great council of 
the white wizards, masters of lore and good magic; and that they had at last driven the 
necromancer from his dark hold in the south of mirkwood. 
"ere long now," gandalf was saying, "the forest will grow somewhat more wholesome. 
the north will be freed from that horror for many long years, i hope. yet i wish he were 
banished from the world!" 

"it would be well indeed," said elrond; "but i fear that will not come about in this age of

hush! hush! oak, ash, and thorn!

"well, merry people!" said bilbo looking out. "what time by the moon is this? your lullaby 
would waken a drunken goblin! yet i thank you." 
"and your snores would waken a stone dragon - yet we thank you," they answered with 
laughter. "it is drawing towards dawn, and you have slept now since the night's 
beginning. tomorrow, perhaps, you will be cured of weariness." 
"a little sleep does a great cure in the house of elrond," said he; "but i will take all the 
cure i can get. a second good night, fair friends!" and with that he went back to bed and 
slept till late morning. 
weariness fell from him soon in that house, and he had many a merry jest and dance, 
early and late, with the elves of the valley. yet even that place could not long delay him 
now, and he thought always of his own home. after a week, therefore, he said farewell to 
elrond, and giving him such small gifts as he would accept, he rode away with

needs than you expect." 
so they put the gold in bags and slung them on the ponies, who were not at all pleased 
about it. after that their going was slower, for most of the time they walked. but the land 
was green and there was much grass through which the hobbit strolled along 
contentedly. he mopped his face with a red silk handkerchief-no! not a single one of his 
own had survived, he had borrowed this one from elrond -for now june had brought 
summer, and the weather was bright and hot again. 
as all things come to an end, even this story, a day came at last when they were in sight 
of the country where bilbo had been born and bred, where the shapes of the land and of 
the trees were as well known to him as his hands and toes. coming to a rise he could 
see his own hill in the distance, and he stopped suddenly and said:
