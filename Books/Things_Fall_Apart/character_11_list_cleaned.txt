[CHARACTER] - 
                a
fanatical convert to the christian church in umuofia. [CHARACTER]'s disrespectful
act of ripping the mask off an egwugwu during an
annual ceremony to honor the earth deity leads to the climactic
clash between the indigenous and colonial justice systems. while
mr. brown, early on, keeps [CHARACTER] in check in the interest 
of community harmony, reverend smith approves of his zealotry.
