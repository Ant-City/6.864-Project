 their faces, that shall eat farther
than their marrow into their fames; and not cinnamus the barber, with
his art, shall be able to take out the brands; but they shall live, and
be read, till the wretches die, as things worst deserving of themselves
in chief, and then of all mankind.

from my house in the black-friars,

this 11th day of february, 1607.

and stoop, almost together, like an arrow;
     shoot through the air as nimbly as a star;
     turn short as doth a swallow; and be here,
     and there, and here, and yonder, all at once;
     present to any humour, all occasion;
     and change a visor, swifter than a thought!
     this is the creature had the art born with him;
     toils not to learn it, but doth practise it
     out of most excellent nature: and such sparks
     are the true parasites, others but their zanis.

     [enter bonario.]

     mos: who's this? bonario, old corbaccio's son?
     the person i was bound to seek.--fair sir,
     you are happily met.

     bon: that cannot be by thee.

     mos: why, sir?

     bon: nay, pray thee know thy way, and leave me:
     i would be loth to interchange discourse
     with such a mate as thou art

     mos: courteous sir,
     scorn not my poverty.

     bon: not i, by heaven;
     but thou shalt give me leave to hate thy baseness.

     mos: baseness!

     bon: ay; answer

     but the maturing; keep you at your couch,
     corbaccio will arrive straight, with the will;
     when he is gone, i'll tell you more.

     [exit.]

     volp: my blood,
     my spirits are return'd; i am alive:
     and like your wanton gamester, at primero,
     whose thought had whisper'd to him, not go less,
     methinks i lie, and draw--for an encounter.

     the passage leading to volpone's chamber.

     enter mosca and bonario.

     mos: sir, here conceal'd,
     [shews him a closet.]
     you may here all. but, pray you,
     have patience, sir;
     [knocking within.]
     --the same's your father knocks:
     i am compell'd to leave you.

     [exit.]

     bon: do so.--yet,
     cannot my thought imagine this a truth.

     mos [aside.]: prevent! did e'er man haste so, for his horns?
     a courtier would not ply it so, for a place.
     --well, now there's no helping it, stay here;
     i'll presently return.

     [exit.]

     corv: where are you, celia?
     you know not wherefore i have brought you hither?

     cel: not well, except you told me.

     corv: now, i will:
     hark hither.

     a closet opening into a gallery.

     enter mosca and bonario.

     mos: sir, your father hath sent word,
     it will be half an hour ere he come;
     and therefore, if you please to walk the while
     into that gallery--at the upper end,
     there are some books to entertain the time:
     and i'll take care no man shall come unto you, sir.

     bon: yes, i will stay there.
     [aside.]--i do doubt this fellow.

     [exit.]

     mos [looking after him.]: there; he is far enough;
     he can hear nothing:
     and, for his father, i can keep him

     [to voltore.]
     --worshipful sir,
     mercury sit upon your thundering tongue,
     or the french hercules, and make your language
     as conquering as his club, to beat along,
     as with a tempest, flat, our adversaries;
     but much more yours, sir.

     volt: here they come, have done.

     mos: i have another witness, if you need, sir,
     i can produce.

     volt: who is it?

     mos: sir, i have her.

     [enter avocatori and take their seats,
     bonario, celia, notario, commandadori, saffi,
     and other officers of justice.]

     1 avoc: the like of this the senate never heard of.

     2 avoc: 'twill come most strange to them when we report it.

     4 avoc: the gentlewoman has been ever held
     of unreproved name.

     3 avoc: so has the youth.

     4 avoc: the more unnatural part that of his father.

     2 avoc: more of the husband.

     1 avoc: i not know to give
     his act a name, it is so monstrous!

     4 avoc: but the impos

     i'm sorry our credulity hath wrong'd him.

     4 avoc: these are two creatures!

     3 avoc: i've an earthquake in me.

     2 avoc: their shame, even in their cradles, fled their faces.

     4 avoc [to volt.]: you have done a worthy service to the state, sir,
     in their discovery.

     1 avoc: you shall hear, ere night,
     what punishment the court decrees upon them.

     [exeunt avocat., not., and officers with bonario and celia.]

     volt: we thank your fatherhoods.--how like you it?

     mos: rare.
     i'd have your tongue, sir, tipt with gold for this;
     i'd have you be the heir to the whole city;
     the earth i'd have want men, ere you want living:
     they're bound to erect your statue in st. mark's.
     signior corvino, i would have you go
     and shew yourself, that you have conquer'd.

     corv: yes.

     mos: it was much better that you should profess
     yourself a cuckold thus, than

     'tis but confederacy, to blind the rest.
     you are the heir.

     volt: a strange, officious,
     troublesome knave! thou dost torment me.

     volp: i know--
     it cannot be, sir, that you should be cozen'd;
     'tis not within the wit of man to do it;
     you are so wise, so prudent; and 'tis fit
     that wealth and wisdom still should go together.

     1 avoc: then bring them forth to sentence.

     volt: o, my most honour'd fathers, let your mercy
     once win upon your justice, to forgive--
     i am distracted--

     volp [aside.]: what will he do now?

     i know not which to address myself to first;

     and my conundrums! well, go you, and seek him:
     his meaning may be truer than my fear.
     bid him, he straight come to me to the court;
     thither will i, and, if't be possible,

     professeth, that the gentleman was wrong'd,
     and that the gentlewoman was brought thither,
     forced by her husband, and there left.

     volt: most true.

     cel: how ready is heaven to those that pray!

     1 avoc: but that
     volpone would have ravish'd her, he holds
     utterly false; knowing his impotence.
