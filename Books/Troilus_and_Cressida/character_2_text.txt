    the princes orgillous, their high blood chaf'd,
    have to the port of athens sent their ships

    doth lesser blench at suff'rance than i do.
    at priam's royal table do i sit;
    and when fair cressid comes into my thoughts-
    so, traitor, then she comes when she is thence.
  pandarus. well, she look'd yesternight fairer than ever i saw her
    look, or any woman else.
  troilus. i was about to tell thee: when my heart,
    as wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,
    lest hector or my father should perceive me,
    i have, as when the sun doth light a storm,
    buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile.
    but sorrow that is couch'd in seeming gladness
    is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.
  pandarus. an her hair were not somewhat darker than helen's-well,
    go to- there were no more comparison between the women. but, for
    my part, she is my kinswoman; i would not, as they term it,
    praise her, but i would somebody had heard her talk yeste

act i. scene 2.
troy. a street

enter cressida and her man alexander

  cressida. who were those went by?
  alexander. queen hecuba and helen.
  cressida. and whither go they?
  alexander. up to the eastern tower,
    whose height commands as subject all the vale,
    to see the battle. hector, whose patience
    is as a virtue fix'd, to-day was mov'd.
    he chid andromache, and struck his armourer;
    and, like as there were husbandry in war,
    before the sun rose he was harness'd light,
    and to the field goes he; where every flower
    did as a prophet weep what it foresaw
    in hector's wrath.
  cressida. what was his cause of anger?
  alexander. the noise goes, this: there is among the greeks
    a lord of troyan blood, nephew to hector;
    they call him ajax.

t his valour is crush'd into folly, his folly sauced
    with discretion. there is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a
    glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of
    it; he is melancholy without cause and merry against the hair; he
    hath the joints of every thing; but everything so out of joint
    that he is a gouty briareus, many hands and no use, or purblind
    argus, all eyes and no sight.
  cressida. but how should this man, that makes me smile, make hector
      angry?
  alexander. they say he yesterday cop'd hector in the battle and
    struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since
    kept hector fasting and waking.

                          enter pandarus

  cressida. who comes here?
  alexander. madam, your uncle pandarus.
  cressida. hector's a gallant man.
  alexander. as may be in the world, lady.
  pandarus. what's that? what's that?
  cressida. good morrow, uncle pandarus.
  pandarus. good morrow, cousin c

ressid. what do you talk of?- good
    morrow, alexander.-how do you, cousin? when were you at ilium?
  cressida. this morning, uncle.
  pandarus. what were you talking of when i came? was hector arm'd
    and gone ere you came to ilium? helen was not up, was she?
  cressida. hector was gone; but helen was not up.
  pandarus. e'en so. hector was stirring early.
  cressida. that were we talking of, and of his anger.
  pandarus. was he angry?
  cressida. so he says here.
  pandarus. true, he was so; i know the cause too; he'll lay about
    him today, i can tell them that. and there's troilus will not
    come far behind him; let them take heed of troilus, i can tell
    them that too.
  cressida. what, is he angry too?
  pandarus. who, troilus? troilus is the better man of the two.
  cressida. o jupiter! there's no compari

  pandarus. what, not between troilus and hector? do you know a man
    if you see him?
  cressida. ay, if i ever saw him before and knew him.
  pandarus. well, i say troilus is troilus.
  cressida. then you say as i say, for i am sure he is not hector.
  pandarus. no, nor hector is not troilus in some degrees.
  cressida. 'tis just to each of them: he is himself.
  pandarus. himself! alas, poor troilus! i would he were!
  cressida. so he is.
  pandarus. condition i had gone barefoot to india.
  cressida. he is not hector.
  pandarus. himself! no, he's not himself. would 'a were himself!
    well, the gods are above; time must friend or end. well, troilus,
    well! i would my heart were in her body! no, hector is not a
    better man than troilus.
  cressida.

    year.

  cressida. then she's a merry greek indeed.
  pandarus. nay, i am sure she does. she came to him th' other day
    into the compass'd window-and you know he has not past three or
    four hairs on his chin-
  cressida. indeed a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
    particulars therein to a total.
  pandarus. why, he is very young, and yet will he within three pound
    lift as much as his brother hector.
  cressida. is he so young a man and so old a lifter?
  pandarus. but to prove to you that helen loves him: she came and
    puts me her white hand to his cloven chin-
  cressida. juno have mercy! how came it cloven?
  pandarus. why, you know, 'tis dimpled. i think his smiling becomes
    him better than any man in all phrygia.
  cressida. o, he smiles valiantly!
  pandarus. does he not?
  cressida. o yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn!
  pandarus. why, go to, then! but to prove to you

eed, she has a marvell's white hand, i must needs
    confess.
  cressida. without the rack.
  pandarus. and she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.
  cressida. alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.
  pandarus. but there was such laughing! queen hecuba laugh'd that
    her eyes ran o'er.
  cressida. with millstones.
  pandarus. and cassandra laugh'd.
  cressida. but there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her
    eyes. did her eyes run o'er too?
  pandarus. and hector laugh'd.
  cressida. at what was all this laughing?
  pandarus. marry, at the white hair that helen spied on troilus'
    chin.
  cressida. an't had been a green hair i should have laugh'd too.
  pandarus. they laugh'd not so much at the hair as at his pretty
    answer.
  cressida. what was his answer?
  pandarus. quoth she 'here's but two and fifty hairs on your chin,
    and one of them is white.'
  cressida. this is her question.
  pandarus. that's true; make no question of that.

                       antenor passes

  cressida. who's that?
  pandarus. that's antenor. he has a shrewd wit, i can tell you; and
    he's a man good enough; he's one o' th' soundest judgments in
    troy, whosoever, and a proper man of person. when comes troilus?
    i'll show you troilus anon. if he see me, you shall see him nod
    at me.
  cressida. will he give you the nod?
  pandarus. you shall see.
  cressida. if he do, the rich shall have more.

                     hector passes

  pandarus. that's hector, that, that, look you, that; there's a
    fellow! go thy way, hector! there's a brave man, niece. o brave
    hector! look how he looks. there's a countenance! is't not a
    brave man?
  cressida. o, a brave man!
  pandarus. is 'a not? it does a man's heart good. look you what
    hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, do you see? look you
    there. there's no jesting; there's laying on; take't off who
    will, as they say. there be hacks.

  pandarus. where? yonder? that's deiphobus. 'tis troilus. there's a
    man, niece. hem! brave troilus, the prince of chivalry!
  cressida. peace, for shame, peace!
  pandarus. mark him; note him. o brave troilus! look well upon him,
    niece; look you how his sword is bloodied, and his helm more
    hack'd than hector's; and how he looks, and how he goes! o
    admirable youth! he never saw three and twenty. go thy way,
    troilus, go thy way. had i a sister were a grace or a daughter a
    goddess, he should take his choice. o admirable man! paris? paris
    is dirt to him; and, i warrant, helen, to change, would give an
    eye to boot.

  ulysses. troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,
    and the great hector's sword had lack'd a master,
    but for these instances:
    the specialty of rule hath been neglected;
    and look how many grecian tents do stand
    hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.

    to whom the foragers shall all repair,

    we have, great agamemnon, here in troy
    a prince called hector-priam is his father-

    he hath a lady wiser, fairer, truer,
    than ever greek did couple in his arms;
    and will to-morrow with his trumpet call
    mid-way between your tents and walls of troy
    to rouse a grecian that is true in love.
    if any come, hector shall honour him;
    if none, he'll say in troy, when he retires,
    the grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
    the splinter of a lance. even so much.

    to answer for his love, tell him from me
    i'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver,

  ulysses. nestor!
  nestor. what says ulysses?
  ulysses. i have a young conception in my brain;
    be you my time to bring it to some shape.
  nestor. what is't?
  ulysses. this 'tis:
    blunt wedges rive hard knots. the seeded pride
    that hath to this maturity blown up
    in rank achilles must or now be cropp'd
    or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil
    to overbulk us all.
  nestor. well, and how?
  ulysses. this challenge that the gallant hector sends,
    however it is spread in general name,
    relates in purpose only to achilles.
  nestor. true. the purpose is perspicuous even as substance
    whose grossness little characters sum up;
    and, in the publication, make no strain
    but that achilles, were his brain as barren
    as banks of libya-though, apollo knows,
    'tis dry enough-will with great speed of judgment,
    ay, with celerity, find hector's purpose
    pointing on him.

  nestor. why, 'tis most meet. who may you else oppose
    that can from hector bring those honours off,
    if not achilles? though 't be a sportful combat,
    yet in this trial much opinion dwells;
    for here the troyans taste our dear'st repute
    with their fin'st palate; and trust to me, ulysses,
    our imputation shall be oddly pois'd
    in this vile action; for the success,
    although particular, shall give a scantling
    of good or bad unto the general;

    and choice, being mutual act of all our souls,
    makes merit her election, and doth boil,
    as 'twere from forth us all, a man distill'd
    out of our virtues; who miscarrying,
    what heart receives from hence a conquering part,
    to steel a strong opinion to themselves?

    that ever hector and achilles meet;
    for both our honour and our shame in this
    are dogg'd with two strange followers.

    why, then we do our main opinion crush
    in taint of our best man. no, make a lott'ry;

    thus once again says nestor from the greeks:
    'deliver helen, and all damage else-
    as honour, loss of time, travail, expense,
    wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consum'd
    in hot digestion of this cormorant war-
    shall be struck off.' hector, what say you to't?
  hector. though no man lesser fears the greeks than i,
    as far as toucheth my particular,
    yet, dread priam,
    there is no lady of more softer bowels,
    more spongy to suck in the sense of fear,
    more ready to cry out 'who knows what follows?'
    than hector is. the wound of peace is surety,
    surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd

    the very wings of reason to his heels
    and fly like chidden mercury from jove,
    or like a star disorb'd? nay, if we talk of reason,
    let's shut our gates and sleep. manhood and honour

  hector. but value dwells not in particular will:
    it holds his estimate and dignity
    as well wherein 'tis precious of itself
    as in the prizer. 'tis mad idolatry
    to make the service greater than the god-i

    there's not the meanest spirit on our party
    without a heart to dare or sword to draw

    whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfam'd

    well may we fight for her whom we know well

  hector. paris and troilus, you have both said well;
    and on the cause and question now in hand
    have gloz'd, but superficially; not much
    unlike young men, whom aristode thought
    unfit to hear moral philosophy.
    the reasons you allege do more conduce
    to the hot passion of distemp'red blood
    than to make up a free determination
    'twixt right and wrong; for pleasure and revenge
    have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
    of any true decision. nature craves

    there is a law in each well-order'd nation

    most disobedient and refractory.
    if helen, then, be wife to sparta's king-

    to have her back return'd. thus to persist

    great hector was as good a man as he.
  agamemnon. march patiently along. let one be sent
    to pray achilles see us at our tent.
    if in his death the gods have us befriended;
    great troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.

 hector is slain.
  all. hector! the gods forbid!
  troilus. he's dead, and at the murderer's horse's tail,
    in beastly sort, dragg'd through the shameful field.
    frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed.
    sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at troy.
    i say at once let your brief plagues be mercy,
    and linger not our sure destructions on.
  aeneas. my lord, you do discomfort all the host.
  troilus. you understand me not that tell me so.
    i do not speak of flight, of fear of death,

  but dare all imminence that gods and men
    address their dangers in. hector is gone.
    who shall tell priam so, or hecuba?
    let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd
    go in to troy, and say there 'hector's dead.'
    there is a word will priam turn to stone;
    make wells and niobes of the maids and wives,
    cold statues of the youth; and, in a word,
    scare troy out of itself. but, march away;
    hector is dead; there is no more to say.
    stay yet. you vile abominable tents,
    thus proudly pight upon our phrygian plains,
    let titan rise as early as he dare,
    i'll through and through you. and, thou great-siz'd coward,
    no space of earth shall sunder our two hates;
    i'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,
    that mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts.
    strike a free march to troy. with comfort go;
    hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.
