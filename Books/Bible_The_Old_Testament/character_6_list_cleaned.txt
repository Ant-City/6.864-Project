[CHARACTER] - 
                israel's
first king. after god chooses [CHARACTER] to be king, [CHARACTER] loses his divine
right to rule israel by committing two religious errors. [CHARACTER] acts
as a character foil to david, because his plot to murder david only highlights
david's mercy to [CHARACTER] in return. [CHARACTER]'s inner turmoil over the inscrutability
of god's exacting standards makes him a sympathetic but tragic figure.
