ngs all round. it
was littered with straw and boxes, and cardboard. the sunshine actually
caught one crate whose straw was streaming on to the yard like gold. but
elsewhere the place was like a pit. there were several doors, and two
flights of steps. straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of
a staircase, loomed the ominous words â€œthomas jordan and son--surgical
appliances.â€ mrs. morel went first, her son followed her. charles i
mounted his scaffold with a lighter heart than had paul morel as he
followed his mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

she pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. in front of her
was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere, and clerks,
with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about in an at-home
sort of way. the light was subdued, the glossy cream parcels seemed
luminous, the counters were of dark brown wood. all was quiet and very
homely. mrs. morel took two steps forward, then waited. paul stood
behind her. she

€™ll fetch him,â€ answered the young man.

he went down to the glass office. a red-faced, white-whiskered old man
looked up. he reminded paul of a pomeranian dog. then the same little
man came up the room. he had short legs, was rather stout, and wore
an alpaca jacket. so, with one ear up, as it were, he came stoutly and
inquiringly down the room.

â€œgood-morning!â€ he said, hesitating before mrs. morel, in doubt as to
whether she were a customer or not.

â€œgood-morning. i came with my son, paul morel. you asked him to call
this morning.â€

â€œcome this way,â€ said mr. jordan, in a rather snappy little manner
intended to be businesslike.

they followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room, upholstered
in black american leather, glossy with the rubbing of many customers.
on the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather hoops tangled
together. they looked new and living. paul sniffed the odour of new
wash-leather. he wondered what the things were. by this time he was so
much stu

one cough, and saw in the office
at the end of the room an old, decaying clerk, in a round smoking-cap of
black velvet embroidered with red and green, opening letters. he waited
and waited. one of the junior clerks went to the old man, greeted him
cheerily and loudly. evidently the old â€œchiefâ€ was deaf. then the young
fellow came striding importantly down to his counter. he spied paul.

â€œhello!â€ he said. â€œyou the new lad?â€

â€œyes,â€ said paul.

â€œhâ€™m! whatâ€™s your name?â€

â€œpaul morel.â€

â€œpaul morel? all right, you come on round here.â€

paul followed him round the rectangle of counters. the room was second
storey. it had a great hole in the middle of the floor, fenced as with a
wall of counters, and down this wide shaft the lifts went, and the light
for the bottom storey. also there was a corresponding big, oblong hole
in the ceiling, and one could see above, over the fence of the top
floor, some machinery; and right away overhead was the glass roof, and
all light for

differently.

mr. jordan gave a little grunt, not unamiable. paul divined that his
masterâ€™s bark was worse than his bite. indeed, the little manufacturer,
although he spoke bad english, was quite gentleman enough to leave his
men alone and to take no notice of trifles. but he knew he did not
look like the boss and owner of the show, so he had to play his role of
proprietor at first, to put things on a right footing.

â€œletâ€™s see, whatâ€™s your name?â€ asked mr. pappleworth of the boy.

â€œpaul morel.â€

it is curious that children suffer so much at having to pronounce their
own names.

â€œpaul morel, is it? all right, you paul-morel through them things there,
and then--â€

mr. pappleworth subsided on to a stool, and began writing. a girl came
up from out of a door just behind, put some newly-pressed elastic web
appliances on the counter, and returned. mr. pappleworth picked up the
whitey-blue knee-band, examined it, and its yellow order-paper quickly,
and put it on one side. next was a f

tartled. she heard him putting his bicycle in the stable
underneath, and talking to jimmy, who had been a pit-horse, and who was
seedy.

â€œwell, jimmy my lad, how are ter? nobbut sick anâ€™ sadly, like? why,
then, itâ€™s a shame, my owd lad.â€

she heard the rope run through the hole as the horse lifted its head
from the ladâ€™s caress. how she loved to listen when he thought only
the horse could hear. but there was a serpent in her eden. she searched
earnestly in herself to see if she wanted paul morel. she felt there
would be some disgrace in it. full of twisted feeling, she was afraid
she did want him. she stood self-convicted. then came an agony of new
shame. she shrank within herself in a coil of torture. did she want paul
morel, and did he know she wanted him? what a subtle infamy upon her.
she felt as if her whole soul coiled into knots of shame.

agatha was dressed first, and ran downstairs. miriam heard her greet
the lad gaily, knew exactly how brilliant her grey eyes became with that

tone. she herself would have felt it bold to have greeted him in such
wise. yet there she stood under the self-accusation of wanting him,
tied to that stake of torture. in bitter perplexity she kneeled down and
prayed:

â€œo lord, let me not love paul morel. keep me from loving him, if i ought
not to love him.â€

something anomalous in the prayer arrested her. she lifted her head and
pondered. how could it be wrong to love him? love was godâ€™s gift. and
yet it caused her shame. that was because of him, paul morel. but, then,
it was not his affair, it was her own, between herself and god. she was
to be a sacrifice. but it was godâ€™s sacrifice, not paul morelâ€™s or her
own. after a few minutes she hid her face in the pillow again, and said:

everal times during the exhibition mrs. morel went to the castle
unknown to paul. she wandered down the long room looking at the other
exhibits. yes, they were good. but they had not in them a certain
something which she demanded for her satisfaction. some made her
jealous, they were so good. she looked at them a long time trying to
find fault with them. then suddenly she had a shock that made her heart
beat. there hung paulâ€™s picture! she knew it as if it were printed on
her heart.

â€œname--paul morel--first prize.â€

it looked so strange, there in public, on the walls of the castle
gallery, where in her lifetime she had seen so many pictures. and she
glanced round to see if anyone had noticed her again in front of the
same sketch.

but she felt a proud woman. when she met well-dressed ladies going home
to the park, she thought to herself:

â€œyes, you look very well--but i wonder if your son has two first prizes
in the castle.â€

and she walked on, as proud a little woman as any in nottin

ot really.â€

â€œthen what?â€ she asked slowly.

â€œeh, i donâ€™t know--perhaps you like her because sheâ€™s got a grudge
against men.â€

that was more probably one of his own reasons for liking mrs. dawes,
but this did not occur to him. they were silent. there had come into his
forehead a knitting of the brows which was becoming habitual with him,
particularly when he was with miriam. she longed to smooth it away, and
she was afraid of it. it seemed the stamp of a man who was not her man
in paul morel.

there were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl. he reached
over and pulled out a bunch.

â€œif you put red berries in your hair,â€ he said, â€œwhy would you look like
some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?â€

she laughed with a naked, painful sound.

â€œi donâ€™t know,â€ she said.

his vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.

â€œwhy canâ€™t you laugh?â€ he said. â€œyou never laugh laughter. you only
laugh when something is odd or incongruous

.

â€œi think you are despicable!â€ she said.

and again he laughed, in a way that tortured miriam.

â€œand i knew you couldnâ€™t jump that heap,â€ he teased.

she turned her back on him. yet everybody could see that the only person
she listened to, or was conscious of, was he, and he of her. it pleased
the men to see this battle between them. but miriam was tortured.

paul could choose the lesser in place of the higher, she saw. he could
be unfaithful to himself, unfaithful to the real, deep paul morel.
there was a danger of his becoming frivolous, of his running after his
satisfaction like any arthur, or like his father. it made miriam bitter
to think that he should throw away his soul for this flippant traffic of
triviality with clara. she walked in bitterness and silence, while the
other two rallied each other, and paul sported.

and afterwards, he would not own it, but he was rather ashamed of
himself, and prostrated himself before miriam. then again he rebelled.

â€œitâ€™s not religious

arge, uplifted church, the thicket of the town, merged into one
atmosphere--dark, brooding, and sorrowful, every bit.

â€œis that two oâ€™clock striking?â€ mrs. dawes said in surprise.

paul started, and everything sprang into form, regained its
individuality, its forgetfulness, and its cheerfulness.

they hurried back to work.

when he was in the rush of preparing for the nightâ€™s post, examining the
work up from fannyâ€™s room, which smelt of ironing, the evening postman
came in.

â€œâ€˜mr. paul morel,â€™â€ he said, smiling, handing paul a package. â€œa ladyâ€™s
handwriting! donâ€™t let the girls see it.â€

the postman, himself a favourite, was pleased to make fun of the girlsâ€™
affection for paul.

it was a volume of verse with a brief note: â€œyou will allow me to send
you this, and so spare me my isolation. i also sympathise and wish you
well.--c.d.â€ paul flushed hot.

â€œgood lord! mrs. dawes. she canâ€™t afford it. good lord, who everâ€™d have
thought it!â€

he was suddenly intens

te him at that
minute; and at the same time, seeing the wet hair on the manâ€™s forehead,
he thought he looked pathetic. he did not move.

â€œcome out, you--,â€ said dawes.

â€œthatâ€™s enough, dawes,â€ cried the barmaid.

â€œcome on,â€ said the â€œchucker-outâ€, with kindly insistence, â€œyouâ€™d better
be getting on.â€

and, by making dawes edge away from his own close proximity, he worked
him to the door.

â€œthatâ€™s the little sod as started it!â€ cried dawes, half-cowed, pointing
to paul morel.

â€œwhy, what a story, mr. dawes!â€ said the barmaid. â€œyou know it was you
all the time.â€

still the â€œchucker-outâ€ kept thrusting his chest forward at him, still
he kept edging back, until he was in the doorway and on the steps
outside; then he turned round.

â€œall right,â€ he said, nodding straight at his rival.

paul had a curious sensation of pity, almost of affection, mingled with
violent hate, for the man. the coloured door swung to; there was silence
in the bar.

â€œserve, him

efore anyone could help him, thomas jordan had collided with the flimsy
spring-door. it had given way, and let him crash down the half-dozen
steps into fannyâ€™s room. there was a second of amazement; then men and
girls were running. dawes stood a moment looking bitterly on the scene,
then he took his departure.

thomas jordan was shaken and braised, not otherwise hurt. he was,
however, beside himself with rage. he dismissed dawes from his
employment, and summoned him for assault.

at the trial paul morel had to give evidence. asked how the trouble
began, he said:

â€œdawes took occasion to insult mrs. dawes and me because i accompanied
her to the theatre one evening; then i threw some beer at him, and he
wanted his revenge.â€

â€œ_cherchez la femme!_â€ smiled the magistrate.

the case was dismissed after the magistrate had told dawes he thought
him a skunk.

â€œyou gave the case away,â€ snapped mr. jordan to paul.

â€œi donâ€™t think i did,â€ replied the latter. â€œbesides, you didnâ€™t rea

â€™s quite enough.â€

â€œiâ€™m glad you think so.â€

and she was cold to him for some time--she hated him; and while she was
cold and contemptuous, he was uneasy till she had forgiven him again.
but when they started afresh they were not any nearer. he kept her
because he never satisfied her.

in the spring they went together to the seaside. they had rooms at
a little cottage near theddlethorpe, and lived as man and wife. mrs.
radford sometimes went with them.

it was known in nottingham that paul morel and mrs. dawes were going
together, but as nothing was very obvious, and clara always a solitary
person, and he seemed so simple and innocent, it did not make much
difference.

he loved the lincolnshire coast, and she loved the sea. in the early
morning they often went out together to bathe. the grey of the dawn,
the far, desolate reaches of the fenland smitten with winter, the
sea-meadows rank with herbage, were stark enough to rejoice his soul.
as they stepped on to the highroad from their pl

dawes,
never had loved him; but she believed he loved her, at least depended on
her. she felt a certain surety about him that she never felt with paul
morel. her passion for the young man had filled her soul, given her
a certain satisfaction, eased her of her self-mistrust, her doubt.
whatever else she was, she was inwardly assured. it was almost as if
she had gained herself, and stood now distinct and complete. she had
received her confirmation; but she never believed that her life belonged
to paul morel, nor his to her. they would separate in the end, and the
rest of her life would be an ache after him. but at any rate, she knew
now, she was sure of herself. and the same could almost be said of him.
together they had received the baptism of life, each through the other;
but now their missions were separate. where he wanted to go she could
not come with him. they would have to part sooner or later. even if they
married, and were faithful to each other, still he would have to leave
her, go on al

on the brim of the dip, black against the
sky, like wild beasts glaring curiously with yellow eyes down into the
darkness. it was the town that seemed savage and uncouth, glaring on the
clouds at the back of him. some creature stirred under the willows of
the farm pond. it was too dark to distinguish anything.

he was close up to the next stile before he saw a dark shape leaning
against it. the man moved aside.

â€œgood-evening!â€ he said.

â€œgood-evening!â€ morel answered, not noticing.

â€œpaul morel?â€ said the man.

then he knew it was dawes. the man stopped his way.

â€œiâ€™ve got yer, have i?â€ he said awkwardly.

â€œi shall miss my train,â€ said paul.

he could see nothing of dawesâ€™s face. the manâ€™s teeth seemed to chatter
as he talked.

â€œyouâ€™re going to get it from me now,â€ said dawes.

morel attempted to move forward; the other man stepped in front of him.

â€œare yer goinâ€™ to take that top-coat off,â€ he said, â€œor are you goinâ€™ to
lie down to it?â€

paul was afr

ter than he is by now.â€

â€œi donâ€™t know anything of his home circumstances, except that heâ€™s
separated from his wife and has been a bit down, i believe. but tell him
about me, will you? tell him iâ€™ll come and see him.â€

the next time morel saw the doctor he said:

â€œand what about dawes?â€

â€œi said to him,â€ answered the other, â€œâ€˜do you know a man from nottingham
named morel?â€™ and he looked at me as if heâ€™d jump at my throat. so i
said: â€˜i see you know the name; itâ€™s paul morel.â€™ then i told him about
your saying you would go and see him. â€˜what does he want?â€™ he said, as
if you were a policeman.â€

â€œand did he say he would see me?â€ asked paul.

â€œhe wouldnâ€™t say anything--good, bad or indifferent,â€ replied the
doctor.

â€œwhy not?â€

â€œthatâ€™s what i want to know. there he lies and sulks, day in, day out.
canâ€™t get a word of information out of him.â€

â€œdo you think i might go?â€ asked paul.

â€œyou might.â€
