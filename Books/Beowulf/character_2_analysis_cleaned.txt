[CHARACTER]
likely the poem's most memorable creation, [CHARACTER] is
one of the three monsters that beowulf battles. his nature is ambiguous. though
he has many animal attributes and a grotesque, monstrous appearance,
he seems to be guided by vaguely human emotions and impulses, and
he shows more of an interior life than one might expect. exiled
to the swamplands outside the boundaries of human society, [CHARACTER]
is an outcast who seems to long to be reinstated. the poet hints
that behind [CHARACTER]'s aggression against the danes lies loneliness
and jealousy. by lineage, [CHARACTER] is a member of "cain's clan, whom
the creator had outlawed / and condemned as outcasts." (106-107).
he is thus descended from a figure who epitomizes resentment and
malice. while the poet somewhat sympathetically suggests that [CHARACTER]'s
deep bitterness about being excluded from the revelry in the mead-hall
owes, in part, to his accursed status, he also points out that [CHARACTER]
is "[m]alignant by nature" and that he has "never show[n] remorse"
(137).
