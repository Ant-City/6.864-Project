th.  war at his beginning hath so great an entering and
so large, that every wight may enter when him liketh, and lightly
[easily] find war: but certes what end shall fall thereof it is not
light to know. for soothly when war is once begun, there is full
many a child unborn of his mother, that shall sterve [die] young
by cause of that war, or else live in sorrow and die in
wretchedness; and therefore, ere that any war be begun, men
must have great counsel and great deliberation."  and when this
old man weened [thought, intended] to enforce his tale by
reasons, well-nigh all at once began they to rise for to break his
tale, and bid him full oft his words abridge. for soothly he that
preacheth to them that list not hear his words, his sermon them
annoyeth. for jesus sirach saith, that music in weeping is a
noyous [troublesome] thing.  this is to say, as much availeth to

quoth he, "sower of chaste counsel, herd* of us all;           *shepherd
the fruit of thilke* seed of chastity                              *that

"for thilke spouse, that she took *but now,*                    *lately*
full like a fierce lion, she sendeth here,
as meek as e'er was any lamb to owe."
and with that word anon there gan appear
an old man, clad in white clothes clear,
that had a book with letters of gold in hand,
and gan before valerian to stand.

valerian, as dead, fell down for dread,
when he him saw; and he up hent* him tho,**                *took **there
and on his book right thus he gan to read;
"one lord, one faith, one god withoute mo',

these wordes all with gold y-written were.

when this was read, then said this olde man,
"believ'st thou this

"i believe all this," quoth valerian,
"for soother* thing than this, i dare well say,                   *truer

then vanish'd the old man, he wist not where
and pope urban him christened right there.

valerian went home, and found cecilie
within his chamber with an angel stand;
this angel had of roses and of lily
corones* two, the which he bare in hand,                         *crowns
