[CHARACTER] - 
                [CHARACTER]'s
narration forms a frame around nelly's; he serves as an intermediary
between nelly and the reader. a somewhat vain and presumptuous gentleman,
he deals very clumsily with the inhabitants of wuthering heights. [CHARACTER]
comes from a more domesticated region of england, and he finds himself
at a loss when he witnesses the strange household's disregard for
the social conventions that have always structured his world. as
a narrator, his vanity and unfamiliarity with the story occasionally
lead him to misunderstand events.
