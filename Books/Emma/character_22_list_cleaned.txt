mr. and mrs. cole - 
 tradespeople and longtime residents of highbury
whose good fortune of the past several years has led them to adopt
a luxurious lifestyle that is only a notch below that of the woodhouses.
offended by their attempt to transcend their "only moderately genteel"
social status, emma has long been preparing to turn down any dinner
invitation from the coles in order to teach them their folly in
thinking they can interact socially with the likes of her family.
like the martins, the coles are the means through which emma demonstrates
her class-consciousness.
