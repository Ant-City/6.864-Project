killed, his winning will benefit my mother and prim the most. 
this is what i tell myself to explain the conflicting emotions 
that arise when i think of peeta. the gratitude that he gave me 
an edge by professing his love for me in the interview. the an-
ger at his superiority on the roof. the dread that we may come 
face-to-face at any moment in this arena. 
eleven dead, but none from district 12. i try to work out 
who is left. five career tributes. foxface. thresh and rue. rue 
. . . so she made it through the first day after all. i canâ€™t help 
feeling glad. that makes ten of us. the other three iâ€™ll figure 
out tomorrow. now when it is dark, and i have traveled far, 
and i am nestled high in this tree, now i must try and rest. 
i havenâ€™t really slept in two days, and then thereâ€™s been the 
long dayâ€™s journey into the arena. slowly, i allow my muscles 
to relax. my eyes to close. the last thing i think is itâ€™s lucky i 
donâ€™t snore.

thereâ€™s no alternative. iâ€™m going to have to get in closer and 
see if i canâ€™t discover what exactly protects the supplies. in 
fact, iâ€™m just about to reveal myself when a movement catches 
my eye. several hundred yards to my right, i see someone 
emerge from the woods. for a second, i think itâ€™s rue, but then 
i recognize foxface â€” sheâ€™s the one we couldnâ€™t remember 
this morning â€” creeping out onto the plain. when she decides 
itâ€™s safe, she runs for the pyramid, with quick, small steps. just 
before she reaches the circle of supplies that have been lit-
tered around the pyramid, she stops, searches the ground, and 
carefully places her feet on a spot. then she begins to ap-
proach the pyramid with strange little hops, sometimes land-

few items from a variety of containers, crackers from a crate, a 
handful of apples from a burlap sack that hangs suspended 
from a rope off the side of a bin. but only a handful from each, 
not enough to tip off that the food is missing. not enough to 
cause suspicion. and then sheâ€™s doing her odd little dance 
back out of the circle and scampering into the woods again, 
safe and sound. 
i realize iâ€™m grinding my teeth in frustration. foxface has 
confirmed what iâ€™d already guessed. but what sort of trap 
have they laid that requires such dexterity? has so many trig-
ger points? why did she squeal so as her hands made contact 
with the earth? youâ€™d have thought . . . and slowly it begins to 
dawn on me . . . youâ€™d have thought the very ground was going 
to explode.

running out. 
there is a solution to this, i know there is, if i can only focus 
hard enough. i stare at the pyramid, the bins, the crates, too 
heavy to topple over with an arrow. maybe one contains cook-
ing oil, and the burning arrow idea is reviving when i realize i 
could end up losing all twelve of my arrows and not get a di-
rect hit on an oil bin, since iâ€™d just be guessing. iâ€™m genuinely 
thinking of trying to re-create foxfaceâ€™s trip up to the pyramid 
in hopes of finding a new means of destruction when my eyes 
light on the burlap bag of apples. i could sever the rope in one 
shot, didnâ€™t i do as much in the training center? itâ€™s a big bag, 
but it still might only be good for one explosion. if only i could 
free the apples themselves . . . 
i know what to do. i move into range and give myself three 
arrows to get the job done. i place my feet carefully, block out

where is my little ally? did she make it back to the 
rendezvous point? is she worried about me? at least, the sky 
has shown weâ€™re both alive. 
i run through the surviving tributes on my fingers. the boy 
from 1, both from 2, foxface, both from 11 and 12. just eight 
of us. the betting must be getting really hot in the capitol. 
theyâ€™ll be doing special features on each of us now. probably 
interviewing our friends and families. itâ€™s been a long time 
since a tribute from district 12 made it into the top eight. and 
now there are two of us. although from what cato said, pee-
taâ€™s on his way out. not that cato is the final word on anything.

smarter than the careers, actually finding a few useful items 
in the ashes. a metal pot. a knife blade. iâ€™m perplexed by her 
amusement until i realize that with the careersâ€™ stores elimi-
nated, she might actually stand a chance. just like the rest of 
us. it crosses my mind to reveal myself and enlist her as a 
second ally against that pack. but i rule it out. thereâ€™s some-
thing about that sly grin that makes me sure that befriending 
foxface would ultimately get me a knife in the back. with that 
in mind, this might be an excellent time to shoot her. but sheâ€™s 
heard something, not me, because her head turns away, to-
ward the drop-off, and she sprints for the woods. i wait. no 
one, nothing shows up. still, if foxface thought it was danger-
ous, maybe itâ€™s time for me to get out of here, too. besides, iâ€™m 
eager to tell rue about the pyramid.

they put two and two together yet? figured out i blew up the 
supplies and killed their fellow career? possibly they think 
thresh did this. wouldnâ€™t he be more likely to revenge rueâ€™s 
death than i would? being from the same district? not that he 
ever took any interest in her.

i doubt they think peeta has lit this signal fire. catoâ€™s sure 
heâ€™s as good as dead. i find myself wishing i could tell peeta 
about the flowers i put on rue. that i now understand what 
he was trying to say on the roof. perhaps if he wins the games, 
heâ€™ll see me on victorâ€™s night,

alive. shaking his head to keep me from running to the cornu-
copia. fighting cato to let me escape. even hooking up with 
the careers must have been a move to protect me. peeta, it 
turns out, has never been a danger to me. 
the thought makes me smile. i drop my hands and hold my 
face up to the moonlight so the cameras can be sure to catch it. 
so, who is there left to be afraid of? foxface? the boy tri-
bute from her district is dead. sheâ€™s operating alone, at night. 
and her strategy has been to evade, not attack. i donâ€™t really 
think that, even if she heard my voice, sheâ€™d do anything but 
hope someone else would kill me. 
then thereâ€™s thresh. all right, heâ€™s a distinct threat. but i 
havenâ€™t seen him, not once, since the games began. i think 
about how foxface grew alarmed when she heard a sound at 
the site of the explosion. but she didnâ€™t turn to the woods, sh

about me? have you taken a look at yourself lately?â€ 
â€œi thought cato and clove might have found you. they like 
to hunt at night,â€ he says, still serious. 
â€œclove? which one is that?â€ i ask. 
â€œthe girl from district two. sheâ€™s still alive, right?â€ he says.

the rocks again, put on the lid, and let the whole thing stew. 
iâ€™ve seen very few signs of game around, but i donâ€™t feel 
comfortable leaving peeta alone while i hunt, so i rig half a 
dozen snares and hope i get lucky. i wonder about the other 
tributes, how theyâ€™re managing now that their main source of 
food has been blown up. at least three of them, cato, clove, 
and foxface, had been relying on it. probably not thresh 
though. iâ€™ve got a feeling he must share some of rueâ€™s know-
ledge on how to feed yourself from the earth. are they fighting 
each other? looking for us? maybe one of them has located us 
and is just waiting for the right moment to attack. the idea 
sends me back to the cave.

other tributes. itâ€™s not surprising really. everyone has distin-
guished themselves either by strength or deadliness or cun-
ning. do they suppose, i wonder, that i have peeta with me? i

backpacks, two large black ones with the numbers 2 and 11, a 
medium-size green one with the number 5, and a tiny orange 
one â€” really i could carry it around my wrist â€” that must be 
marked with a 12. 
the table has just clicked into place when a figure darts out 
of the cornucopia, snags the green backpack, and speeds off. 
foxface! leave it to her to come up with such a clever and 
risky idea! the rest of us are still poised around the plain, siz-
ing up the situation, and sheâ€™s got hers. sheâ€™s got us trapped, 
too, because no one wants to chase her down, not while their 
own pack sits so vulnerable on the table. foxface must have 
purposefully left the other packs alone, knowing that to steal 
one without her number would definitely bring on a pursuer. 
that should have been my strategy! by the lime iâ€™ve worked

here. sheâ€™s cost me time, too, because by now itâ€™s clear that i 
must get to the table next. anyone who beats me to it will 
easily scoop up my pack and be gone. without hesitation, i 
sprint for the table. i can sense the emergence of danger be-

my right side so i can hear it and iâ€™m able to deflect it with my 
bow. i turn, drawing back the bowstring and send an arrow

tell that much, to do her any good. what was he doing? trying

thresh and just badly misjudged his location? 
thresh brings the rock down hard against cloveâ€™s temple.

that sheâ€™s a goner. thereâ€™s still life in her now though, in the

itâ€™s no good to run. and my bow is empty, the last loaded ar-

rain drips through several holes in the ceiling, but peeta has 
built a sort of canopy over my head an upper body by wedging 
the square of plastic into the rock above me. 
â€œi wonder what brought on this storm? i mean, whoâ€™s the 
target?â€ says peeta.

in her den somewhere, and clove . . . she cut me an then . . .â€

â€œheâ€™ll be wounded, i bet,â€ i say. 
â€œwhat makes you say that?â€ peeta asks. 
â€œbecause thresh would have never gone down without a 
fight. heâ€™s so strong, i mean, he was. and they were in his ter-

just then, the cannon fires. i whip around, expecting peeta 
to collapse to the ground, but he only raises his eyebrows. the

of blue plastic, careful to trap the berries inside, and goes to 
toss them into the woods.

â€œwait!â€ i cry. i find the leather pouch that belonged to the 
boy from district 1 and fill it with a few handfuls of berries 
from the plastic. â€œif they fooled foxface, maybe they can fool 
cato as well. if heâ€™s chasing us or something, we can act like 
we accidentally drop the pouch and if he eats them â€”â€ 
â€œthen hello district twelve,â€ says peeta. 
â€œthatâ€™s it,â€ i say, securing the pouch to my belt. 
â€œheâ€™ll know where we are now,â€ says peeta. â€œif he was any-
where nearby and saw that hovercraft, heâ€™ll know we killed 
her and come after us.â€ 
peetaâ€™s right. this could be just the opportunity catoâ€™s been 
waiting for. but even if

out for me since the beginning. he probably has had a special 
hatred for me ever since i outscored him in training. a boy 
like peeta would simply shrug that off. but i have a feeling it 
drove cato to distraction. which is not that hard. i think of his

ridiculous reaction to finding the supplies blown up. the oth-
ers were upset, of course, but he was completely unhinged. i 
wonder now if cato might not be entirely sane. 
the sky lights up with the seal, and i watch foxface shine in 
the sky and then disappear from the world forever. he hasnâ€™t 
said it, but i donâ€™t think peeta felt good about killing her, even 
if it was essential. i canâ€™t pretend iâ€™ll miss her, but i have to 
admire her. my guess is if they had given us some sort of test, 
she would have been the smartest of all the tributes. if, in fact, 
we had been setting a trap for her, i bet sheâ€™d have sensed it 
and avoided the berries. it was peetaâ€™s own ignorance that 
brought her down. iâ€™v

that brings me back to cato. but while i think i had a sense 
of foxface, who she was and how she operated, heâ€™s a little 
more slippery. powerful, well trained, but smart? i donâ€™t 
know. not like she was. and utterly lacking in the control fox-
face demonstrated. i believe cato could easily lose his judg-
ment in a fit of temper. not that i can feel superior on that 
point. i think of the moment i sent the arrow flying into the 
apple in the pigâ€™s mouth when i was so enraged. maybe i do 
understand cato better than i think.

apparently nothing does, because when i open my eyes, 
bright hot afternoon light gleams through the rocks. â€œany sign

peeta shakes his head. â€œno, heâ€™s keeping a disturbingly low 
profile.â€ 
â€œhow long do you think weâ€™ll have before the gamemakers 
drive us together?â€ i ask. 
â€œwell, foxface died almost a day ago, so thereâ€™s been plenty 
of time for the audience to place bets and get bored. i guess it 
could happen at any moment,â€ says peeta. 
â€œyeah, i have a feeling todayâ€™s the day,â€ i say. i sit up and 
look out at the peaceful terrain. â€œi wonder how theyâ€™ll do it.â€ 
peeta remains silent. thereâ€™s not really any good answer. 
â€œwell, until they do, no sense in wasting a hunting day. but 
we should probably eat as much as we can hold just in case we

coat and amber eyes . . . foxface! and there, the ashen hair and 
hazel eyes of the boy from district 9 who died as we struggled 
for the backpack! and worst of all, the smallest mutt, with 
dark glossy fur, huge brown eyes and a collar that reads 11 in 
woven straw. teeth bared in hatred. rue . . .
