King Duncan - 
                The
good King of Scotland whom Macbeth, in his ambition for the crown,
murders. Duncan is the model of a virtuous, benevolent, and farsighted
ruler. His death symbolizes the destruction of an order in Scotland
that can be restored only when Duncan's line, in the person of Malcolm,
once more occupies the throne.
