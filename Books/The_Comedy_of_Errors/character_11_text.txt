_duke._ merchant of syracusa, plead no more;
i am not partial to infringe our laws:
the enmity and discord which of late                                 5
sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
to merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,
have seal’d his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
excludes all pity from our threatening looks.                       10
for, since the mortal and intestine jars
’twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
it hath in solemn synods been decreed,
both by the syracusians and ourselves,
to admit no traffic to our adverse towns:                           15
nay, more,
if any born at ephesus be seen
at any syrac

hapless ægeon, whom the fates have mark’d
to bear the extremity of dire mishap!
now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
which princes, would they, may not disannul,                       145
my soul should sue as advocate for thee.
but, though thou art adjudged to the death,
and passed sentence may not be recall’d
but to our honour’s great disparagement,
yet will i favour thee in what i can.                              150
therefore, merchant, i’ll limit thee this day
to seek thy help by beneficial help:
try all the friends thou hast in ephesus;
beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
and live; if no, then thou art doom’d to die.                      155
gaoler, take him to thy custody.

_gaol._ i will, my lord.

_æge._ hopeless and helpless doth ægeon wend,
but to procrastinate his lifeless end.
