f the kind. but
i should certainly think--

mrs. alving. out of the house she must go, and that immediately. that is
as clear as daylight--

manders. yes, of course she must.

mrs. alving. but where to? it would not be right to--

manders. where to? home to her father, of course.

mrs. alving. to whom did you say?

manders. to her--but then, engstrand is not--? good god, mrs. alving,
it's impossible! you must be mistaken after all.

mrs. alving. unfortunately there is no possibility of mistake. johanna
confessed everything to me; and alving could not deny it. so there was
nothing to be done but to get the matter hushed up.

manders. no, you could do nothing else.

mrs. alving. the girl left our service at once, and got a good sum of
money to hold her tongue for the time. the rest she managed for herself
when she got to town. she renewed her old acquaintance with engstrand,
no doubt let him see that she had money in her purse, and told him some
tale about a foreigner who put in here with a yac

 to task; he may be sure of that.--and then the
immorality of such a connection! for money--! how much did the girl
receive?

mrs. alving. three hundred dollars.

manders. just think of it--for a miserable three hundred dollars, to go
and marry a fallen woman!

mrs. alving. then what have you to say of me? i went and married a
fallen man.

manders. why--good heavens!--what are you talking about! a fallen man!

mrs. alving. do you think alving was any purer when i went with him to
the altar than johanna was when engstrand married her?

manders. well, but there is a world of difference between the two
cases--

mrs. alving. not so much difference after all--except in the price:--a
miserable three hundred dollars and a whole fortune.

manders. how can you compare such absolutely dissimilar cases? you had
taken counsel with your own heart and with your natural advisers.

mrs. alving. [without looking at him.] i thought you understood where
what you call my heart had strayed to at the time.

admit that. then perhaps you will make a clean breast
of it, and tell me--the real truth about regina?

mrs. alving. [quickly.] mr. manders!

manders. [reassuringly.] please allow me--

engstrand. about regina! lord, what a turn you gave me! [looks at mrs.
alving.] there's nothing wrong about regina, is there?

manders. we will hope not. but i mean, what is the truth about you and
regina? you pass for her father, eh!

engstrand. [uncertain.] well--h'm--your reverence knows all about me and
poor johanna.

manders. come now, no more prevarication! your wife told mrs. alving the
whole story before quitting her service.

engstrand. well, then, may--! now, did she really?

manders. you see we know you now, engstrand.

engstrand. and she swore and took her bible oath--

manders. did she take her bible oath?

engstrand. no; she only swore; but she did it that solemn-like.

manders. and you have hidden the truth from me all these years? hidden
it from me, who have trusted you without reserve, in ever

he church register, and you withhold from me, year after year, the
explanations you owed alike to me and to the truth. your conduct has
been wholly inexcusable, engstrand; and from this time forward i have
done with you!

engstrand. [with a sigh.] yes! i suppose there's no help for it.

manders. how can you possibly justify yourself?

engstrand. who could ever have thought she'd have gone and made bad
worse by talking about it? will your reverence just fancy yourself in
the same trouble as poor johanna--

manders. i!

engstrand. lord bless you, i don't mean just exactly the same. but i
mean, if your reverence had anything to be ashamed of in the eyes of the
world, as the saying goes. we menfolk oughtn't to judge a poor woman too
hardly, your reverence.

manders. i am not doing so. it is you i am reproaching.

engstrand. might i make so bold as to ask your reverence a bit of a
question?

manders. yes, if you want to.

engstrand. isn't it right and proper for a man to raise up the fallen?

mand

ers. most certainly it is.

engstrand. and isn't a man bound to keep his sacred word?

manders. why, of course he is; but--

engstrand. when johanna had got into trouble through that englishman--or
it might have been an american or a russian, as they call them--well,
you see, she came down into the town. poor thing, she'd sent me about
my business once or twice before: for she couldn't bear the sight of
anything as wasn't handsome; and i'd got this damaged leg of mine. your
reverence recollects how i ventured up into a dancing saloon, where
seafaring men was carrying on with drink and devilry, as the saying
goes. and then, when i was for gi

 engstrand; the ruffians threw you
downstairs. you have told me of the affair already. your infirmity is an
honour to you.

engstrand. i'm not puffed up about it, your reverence. but what i wanted
to say was, that when she came and confessed all to me, with weeping and
gnashing of teeth, i can tell your reverence i was sore at heart to hear
it.

manders. were you indeed, engstrand? well, go on.

engstrand. so i says to her, "the american, he's sailing about on the
boundless sea. and as for you, johanna," says i, "you've committed a
grievous sin, and you're a fallen creature. but jacob engstrand,"
says i, "he's got two good legs to stand upon, he has--" you see, your
reverence, i was speaking figurative-like.

manders. i understand quite well. go on.

engstrand. well, that was how i raised her up and made an honest woman
of her, so as folks shouldn't get to know how as she'd gone astray with
foreigners.

manders. in all that you acted very well. only i cannot approve of your
stooping to take m

engstrand. money? i? not a farthing!

manders. [inquiringly to mrs. alving.] but--

engstrand. oh, wait a minute!--now i recollect. johanna did have a
trifle of money. but i would have nothing to do with that. "no," says i,
"that's mammon; that's the wages of sin. this dirty gold--or notes, or
whatever it was--we'll just flint, that back in the american's face,"
says i. but he was off and away, over the stormy sea, your reverence.

manders. was he really, my good fellow?

engstrand. he was indeed, sir. so johanna and i, we agreed that the
money should go to the child's education; and so it did, and i can
account for every blessed f

arthing of it.

manders. why, this alters the case considerably.

engstrand. that's just how it stands, your reverence. and i make so bold
as to say as i've been an honest father to regina, so far as my poor
strength went; for i'm but a weak vessel, worse luck!

manders. well, well, my good fellow--

engstrand. all the same, i bear myself witness as i've brought up the
child, and lived kindly with poor johanna, and ruled over my own house,
as the scripture has it. but it couldn't never enter my head to go to
your reverence and puff myself up and boast because even the likes of
me had done some good in the world. no, sir; when anything of that
sort happens to jacob engstrand, he holds his tongue about it. it don't
happen so terrible often, i daresay. and when i do come to see your
reverence, i find a mortal deal that's wicked and weak to talk about.
for i said it before, and i says it again--a man's c

manders. yes, yes; we will look into the matter more closely. i entirely
approve of your plan. but now, go before me and make everything
ready, and get the candles lighted, so as to give the place an air of
festivity. and then we will pass an edifying hour together, my good
fellow; for now i quite believe you are in the right frame of mind.

engstrand. yes, i trust i am. and so i'll say good-bye, ma'am, and thank
you kindly; and take good care of regina for me--[wipes a tear from his
eye]--poor johanna's child. well, it's a queer thing, now; but it's just
like as if she'd growd into the very apple of my eye. it is, indeed. [he
bows and goes out through the hall.]

manders. well, what do you say of that man now, mrs. alving? that was a
very different account of matters, was it not?

mrs. alving. yes, it certainly was.

manders. it only shows how excessively careful one ought to be in
judging one's fellow creatures. but what a heartfelt joy it is to
ascertain that one has been mistaken! don't y
