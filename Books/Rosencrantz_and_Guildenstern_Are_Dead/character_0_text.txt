rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead
the play
 act one
two elizabethans passing time in a place without any visible character. they are well-dressed - hats, cloaks,
sticks and all. each of them has a large leather money bag. guildenstern's bag is nearly empty. rosencrantz's bag
is nearly full. the reason being: they are betting on the toss of a coin, in the following manner: guildenstern
(hereafter 'guil') takes a coin out of his bag, spins it, letting it fall. rosencrantz (hereafter 'ros') studies it,
announces it as "heads" (as it happens) and puts it into his own bag. then they repeat the process. they have
apparently been doing it for some time. the run of "heads" is impossible, yet ros betrays no surprise at all -
he feels none. however he is nice enough to feel a little embarrassed attaking so much money off his friend. let
that be his character note. guil is well alive to the oddity of it. he is not worried about the money, but he is
worried by the implica

 ros: tumblers, are you?
 player: we can give you a tumble if that's your taste and times being what they are... otherwise, for a jingle
of coin we can do you a selection of gory romances, full of fine cadence and corpses, pirated from italian;
and it doesn't take much to make a jingle - even a single coin has music in it.

 ros: my name is guildenstern, and this is rosencrantz.

 (without embarrassment.) i'm sorry - his name's guildenstern, and i'm rosencrantz.
 player: a pleasure. we've played to bigger, of course, but quality counts for something. i recognised you at
once -
 ros: and who are we?
 player: - as fellow artists.
 ros: i thought we were gentlemen.
 player: for some of us it is performance, for others, patronage. they are two sides of the same coin, or, let
us say, being as there are so many of us, the same side of two co

 claudius: welcome, dear rosencrantz... (he raises a hand at guil while
ros bows - guil bows late and hurriedly.)... and guildenstern.

half way up he bows down again. with his head down, he twists to look at guil, who is on the way up.)

 ros: both your majesties
 might, by the sovereign power you have on us,
 put your dread pleasure more into command
 than to entreaty.
 guil: but we both obey,
 and here give up ourselves in the full bent
 to lay our service freely at your feet,

 claudius: thanks, rosencrantz (turning to ros who is caught unprepared, while guil bows) and gentle

 gertrude (correcting): thanks, guildenstern (turning to ros, who bows as guil checks upward movement
to bow too - both bent double, squinting at each other)... and gentle rosencrantz. (turning to guil, both
straightening up - guil checks again and bows again.)

 guil: it doesn't matter.

 guil: what are the rules?

star, and our drift represents merely a slight chance of angle to it: we may seize the moment, toss it around while
the moment pass, a short dash here, an exploration there, but we are brought round full circle to face again the
single immutable fact - that we, rosencrantz and guildenstern, are taking hamlet to england.

surreptitiously behind him - and a tight whisper:)

about this.) and even if it's true, it'll just be another shambles.

to the lantern.)
 ros: the position as i see it, then. we, rosencrantz and guildenstern, from our young days brought up with
him, awakened by a man standing on his saddle, are summoned, and arrive, and are instructed to glean what
afflicts him and draw him on to pleasures, such as a play, which unfortunately, as it turns out, is abandoned in some
confusion owing to certain nuances outside our appreciation - which, among other causes, results in, among
other effects, a high, not to say, homicidal, excitement in hamlet, whom we, in consequence, are escorting, for hi
