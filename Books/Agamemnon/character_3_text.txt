 the dead" at troy might waken, groping for some retribution upon
the "slayer of many men" (pp. 15, 20).

if we ask why men are so blind, seeking their welfare thus through
incessant evil, aeschylus will tell us that the cause lies in the
infection of old sin, old cruelty. there is no doubt somewhere a
_[greek: prôtarchos hatê ]_, a "first blind deed of wrong," but in
practice every wrong is the result of another. and the children of atreus
are steeped to the lips in them. when the prophetess cassandra, out of her
first vague horror at the evil house, begins to grope towards some
definite image, first and most haunting comes the sound of the weeping of
two little children, murdered long ago, in a feud that was not theirs.
from that point, more than any other, the daemon or genius of the
house--more than its "luck," a little less than its guardian
angel--becomes an alastor or embodied curse, a "red slayer" which cries
ever for peace and cleansing, but can seek them only in the same blind
way,

through vengeance, and, when that fails, then through more vengeance
(p. 69).

this awful conception of a race intent upon its own wrongs, and blindly
groping towards the very terror it is trying to avoid, is typified, as it
were, in the cassandra story. that daughter of priam was beloved by
apollo, who gave her the power of true prophecy. in some way that we know
not, she broke her promise to the god; and, since his gift could not be
recalled, he added to it the curse that, while she should always foresee
and foretell the truth, none should believe her. the cassandra scene is a
creation beyond praise or criticism. the old scholiast speaks of the "pity
and amazement" which it causes. the elders who talk with her wish to
believe, they try

 to understand, they are really convinced of cassandra's
powers. but the curse is too strong. the special thing which cassandra
tries again and again to say always eludes them, and they can raise no
finger to prevent the disaster happening. and when it does happen they
are, as they have described themselves, weak and very old, "dreams
wandering in the daylight."

the characters of this play seem, in a sense, to arise out of the theme
and consequently to have, amid all their dramatic solidity, a further
significance which is almost symbolic. cassandra is, as it were, the
incarnation of that knowledge which herodotus desc

from the homeric tradition, though in homer (od. iv. 524) he is merely a
servant of aigisthos.

p. 2, l. 28, women's triumph cry.]--this cry of the women recurs several
times in the play: cf. p. 26, ll. 587 ff., p. 55, l. 1234. it is
conventionally represented by "ololû"; as the cry to apollo, paian is
"i-ê," l. 146, and cassandra's sob is "ototoi" or "otototoi," p. 47.

pp. 3 f., ll. 40 ff.]--with this silent scene of clytemnestra's, compare
the long silence of cassandra below, and the silence of prometheus in that
play until his torturers have left him. see the criticism of aeschylus in

p. 22, l. 509, pythian lord.]--apollo is often a sinister figure in
tragedy. cf. sophocles _oedipus_ , ll. 915 ff., pp. 52 ff., and the
similar scene, _electra_, 655 ff. here it is a shock to the herald to come
suddenly on the god who was the chief enemy of the greeks at troy. one
feels apollo an evil presence also in the cassandra scene, 11. 1071 ff.,
pp. 47 ff.

p. 23, l. 530, happy among men.]--the crown of his triumph! early greek
thought was always asking the question, what is human happiness? to the
herald agamemnon has achieved happiness if any one ever did. cf. the
well-known story of croesus asking solon who was the happiest man in the
world (herodotus, i. 30-33).

p. 26, l. 595, our women's joy-cry.]--there seems to have been in argos an
old popular festival, celebrating with joy or mockery the supposed death
of a man and a woman. homer (od. iii. 309 f.) derives it from a rejoicing
by orestes over aigisthos and clytemnestra; cf. below, ll. 1316 ff., p.
59; aeschylus here and sophocles in the _electra_, from a celebration by
clytemnestra of the deaths of agamemnon and cassandra. probably it was
really some ordinary new year and old year celebration to which the poets
give a tragic touch. it seems to have had a woman's "ololugmos" in it,
perhaps uttered by men. see kaibel's note, soph. _electra_ 277-281.

p. 26, l. 612, bronze be dyed like wool.]--impossible in the literal
sense, but there is after all a way of dying a sword red!

similar digressions generally are when they occur in greek plays, to th

shipwreck has suggested this particular idea.) similarly, if a hero was
called aias, and came to great sorrow, one could see that he was so called
from 'aiai,' "alas!"--the antistrophe seems to find a meaning in the name
paris or alexandras, where the etymology is not so clear.

pp. 33 ff.]--entrance of agamemnon. the metre of the chorus indicates
marching; so that apparently the procession takes some time to move across
the orchestra and get into position. cassandra would be dressed, as a
prophetess, in a robe of white reaching to the feet, covered by an
_agrênon_, or net of wool with large meshes; she would have a staff and
certain fillets or crowns. the leader welcomes the king: he explains that,
though he was against the war ten years ago, and has not changed his
opinion, he is a faithful servant of the king ... and that not all are
equally so. he gave a similar hint to the herald above, ll. 546-550, p.
24.

characteristic of aeschylus. euripides would have done it at three times
the length and made all the points clear. in aeschylus the subtlety is
there, but it is not easy to follow.

p. 40, l. 945, these bound slaves.]--i.e. his shoes. the metaphor shows
the trend of his unconscious mind.

p. 41, l. 950, this princess.]--this is the first time that the attention
of the audience is drawn to cassandra. she too is one of aeschylus' silent
figures. i imagine her pale, staring in front of her, almost as if in a
trance, until terror seizes her at clytemnestra's greeting in l. 1035, p.
45.

p. 41, l. 964, the cry.]--i.e. the cry of the possessed prophetess which
rang from the inner sanctuary at delphi and was interpreted by the
priests.--the last two lines of the speech are plain in their meaning but
hard to translate. literally: "when the full, or fulfilled, man walketh

p. 42, l. 976.]--the victim has been drawn into the house; the chorus sing
a low boding song: every audience at a greek tragedy would expect next to
hear a death cry from within, or to see a horrified messenger rush out.
instead of which the door opens and there is clytemnestra: what does she
want? "come thou also!" one victim is not enough.--in the next scene we
must understand the cause of clytemnestra's impatience. if she stays too
long outside, some one will warn agamemnon; if she leaves cassandra, she
with her second sight will warn the chorus. if cassandra could only be got
inside all would be safe!

p. 44, l. 1022, "one there was of old."]--asklêpios, the physician,
restored hippolytus to life, and zeus blasted him for so oversetting the
laws of nature.

has for centuries been translated as if it was all addressed to cassandra:
"but if you do not understand what i say, please indicate the same with
your barbarous hand!"--what makes cassandra at last speak? i think that
the elder probably touches her, and the touch as it were breaks the spell.

translated "dreams!" seems to occur when people see ghosts or visions.

"possessed" or "entranced": the turn to dialogue marks a conscious attempt
to control herself and state plainly her message of warning. in order to
prove her power, she first tells the elders of deeds done in the past
which are known to them but cannot have been known to her. when once they
are convinced of her true seercraft, she will be able to warn them of what
is coming!--the short 'stichom[^y]thia'[**tr: this is a y with a

. one would like to know whether aeschylus made them
speak together confusedly, as would certainly be done on the modern stage,
or whether the stately conventions of greek tragedy preferred that each
speaker should finish his say. in any case, what happens is that after a
moment or two of confused counsel the elders determine to break into the
palace, but as they are mounting the steps the great doors are flung open
and clytemnestra confronts them, standing over the dead bodies of
agamemnon and cassandra.

the illusion intended is that the elders have entered the palace and
discovered clytemnestra. but, as the mechanical arrangements of the greek
stage were not equal to this sudden change of scene, and since also it
would, even with perfect machinery, have a tiresome interrupting effect, a
slight confusion or inconsistency is allowed. we are supposed to be inside
the house; but as a matter of fact the supposition is soon forgotten, and
the play goes on without any attention to the particular pl
