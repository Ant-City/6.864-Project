 in the
laboratories of the university in zurich, delicately poking
at the cervical of a brain, he had felt like a toy-maker rather
than like the tornado who had hurried through the old red
buildings of hopkins, two years before, unstayed by the irony
of the gigantic christ in the entrance hall.
yet he had decided to remain another two years in zurich,
for he did not underestimate the value of toy-making,
in infinite precision, of infinite patience.
to-day he went out to see franz gregorovius at dohmler’s
clinic on the zurichsee. franz, resident pathologist at

the clinic, a vaudois by birth, a few years older than dick,
met him at the tram stop. he had a dark and magnificent aspect
of cagliostro about him, contrasted with holy eyes; he
was the third of the gregoroviuses—his grandfather had instructed
krapaelin when psychiatry was just emerging from
the darkness of all time. in personality he was proud, fiery,
and sheeplike—he fancied himself as a hypn

rands.’ his voice was tense with enthusiasm. ‘in fact,
i sent her without a nurse, with a less stable patient. i’m
intensely proud of this case, which i handled, with your accidental
assistance.’
the car had followed the shore of the zurichsee into a
fertile region of pasture farms and low hills, steepled with
châlets. the sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly
it was a swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and
murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer.
professor dohmler’s plant consisted of three old buildings
and a pair of new ones, between a slight eminence and
the shore of the lake. at its founding, ten years before, it had
been the first modern clinic for mental illness; at a casual
glance no layman would recognize it as a refuge for the broken,
the incomplete, the menacing, of this world, though
two buildings were surrounded with vine-softened walls of
a deceptive height. some men raked straw in the sunshine;

the girl, because i have been waiting to tell you about it so
long.’

he searched for and found a sheaf of papers in a filing
cabinet but after shuffling through them he found they were
in his way and put them on his desk. instead he told dick
the story.

iii
about a year and a half before, doctor dohmler had some
vague correspondence with an american gentleman living
in lausanne, a mr. devereux warren, of the warren family
of chicago. a meeting was arranged and one day mr. warren
arrived at the clinic with his daughter nicole, a girl of
sixteen. she was obviously not well and the nurse who was
with her took her to walk about the grounds while mr. warren
had his consultation.
warren was a strikingly handsome man looking less than
forty. he was a fine american type in every way, tall, broad,

-made—‘un homme très chic,’ as doctor dohmler described
him to franz. his large gray eyes were sun-veined
from rowing on lake geneva, and he had that special air
about him of having known the best of this world. the conversation
was in german, for it developed that he had been
educated at göttingen. he was nervous and obviously very
moved by his errand.
‘doctor dohmler, my daughter isn’t right in the head.
i’ve had lots of specialists and nurses for her and she’s taken
a couple of rest cures but the thing has grown too big for me
and i’ve been strongly recommended to come to you.’
‘very well,’ said doctor dohmler. ‘suppose you start at
the beginning and tell me everything.’
‘there isn’t any beginning, at least there isn’t any insanity

he was very moved as he said this. doctor dohmler saw
that there were tears in the corners of his eyes and noticed
for the first time that there was whiskey on his breath.
‘as a child she was a darling thing—everybody was crazy
about her, everybody that came in contact with her. she was
smart as a whip and happy as the day is long. she liked to
read or draw or dance or play the piano—anything. i used
to hear my wife say she was the only one of our children who
never cried at night. i’ve got an older girl, too, and there was

he broke off and doctor dohmler helped him.
‘she was a perfectly normal, bright, happy child.’
‘perfectly.’
doctor dohmler waited. mr. warren shook his head,
blew a long sigh, glanced quickly at doctor dohmler and
then at the floor again.
‘about eight months ago, or maybe it was six months ago
or maybe ten—i try to figure but i can’t remember exactly
where we were when she began to do funny things—crazy
things. her sister was the first one to say anything to me
about it—because nicole was always the same to me,’ he
added rather hastily, as if some one had accused him of being
to blame, ‘—the same loving little girl. the first thing
was about a valet.’
‘oh, yes,’ said doctor dohm

head, as if, like sherlock holmes, he had expected a valet
and only a valet to be introduced at this point.
‘i had a valet—been with me for years—swiss, by the
way.’ he looked up for doctor dohmler’s patriotic approval.
‘and she got some crazy idea about him. she thought he was
making up to her—of course, at the time i believed her and
i let him go, but i know now it was all nonsense.’
‘what did she claim he had done?’
‘that was the first thing—the doctors couldn’t pin her
down. she just looked at them as if they ought to know what
he’d done. but she certainly meant he’d made some kind of
indecent advances to her—she didn’t leave us in any doubt
of that.’
‘i

see.’
‘of course, i’ve read about women getting lonesome and
thinking there’s a man under the bed and all that, but why
should nicole get such an idea? she could have all the young
men she wanted. we were in lake forest—that’s a summer
place near chicago where we have a place—and she was out
all day playing golf or tennis with boys. and some of them
pretty gone on her at that.’
all the time warren was talking to the dried old package
of doctor dohmler, one section of the latter’s mind kept
thinking intermittently of chicago. once in his youth he
could have gone to chicago as fellow and docent at the university,
and perhaps become rich there and owned his own
clinic instead of being only a minor shareholder in a clinic.
but when he had thought of what he considered his own
thin knowledge spread over that whole area, over all those

it. but he ha

go through under such circumstances, of the ineffectual
efforts they had made in america, finally of the faith in a
change of scene that had made him run the submarine
blockade and bring his daughter to switzerland.
‘—on a united states cruiser,’ he specified with a touch of
hauteur. ‘it was possible for me to arrange that, by a stroke
of luck. and, may i add,’ he smiled apologetically, ‘that as
they say: money is no object.’
‘certainly not,’ agreed dohmler dryly.
he was wondering why and about what the man was lying
to him. or, if he was wrong about that, what was the
falsity that pervaded the whole room, the handsome figure
in tweeds sprawling in his chair with a sportsman’s ease?
that was a tragedy out there, in the february day, the young
bird with wings crushed somehow, and inside here it was all
too thin, thin and wrong.

‘i would like—to talk to her—a few minutes now,’ said
doctor dohmler, going into english

and then they waited with increasing interest as the days
passed for mr. warren’s promised second visit.
it was slow in coming. after a fortnight doctor dohmler
wrote. confronted with further silence he committed what
was for those days ‘une folie,’ and telephoned to the grand
hotel at vevey. he learned from mr. warren’s valet that he
was at the moment packing to sail for america. but reminded
that the forty francs swiss for the call would show up
on the clinic books, the blood of the tuileries guard rose
to doctor dohmler’s aid and mr. warren was got to the
phone.

‘but look here, doctor, that’s just what you’re for. i have a

doctor dohmler had never yet spoken to any one so far

away but he dispatched his ultimatum so firmly into the
phone that the agonized american at the other end yielded.
half an hour after this second arrival on the zurichsee,
warren had broken down, his fine shoulders shaking with
awful sobs inside his easy fitting coat, his eyes redder than
the very sun on lake geneva, and they had the awful story.
‘it just happened,’ he said hoarsely. ‘i don’t know—i don’t

a broken sarcasm came into his voice. ‘people used to say

to wipe their eyes. we were just like lovers—and then all
at once we were lovers—and ten minutes after it happened
i could have shot myself—except i guess i’m such a goddamned
degenerate i didn’t have the nerve to do it.’
‘then what?’ said doctor dohmler, thinking again of
chicago and of a mild pale gentleman with a pince-nez who
had looked him over in zurich thirty years before. ‘did this
thing go on?’
‘oh, no! she almost—she seemed to freeze up right away.
she’d just say, ‘never mind, never mind, daddy. it doesn’t
matter. never mind.’’
‘there were no consequences?’

‘no.’ he gave one short convulsive sob and blew his nose
several times. ‘except now there’re plenty of consequences.’

‘peasant!’—it was one of the few absolute worldly judgments
that he had permitted himself for twenty years. then
he said:
‘i would like for you to go to a hotel in zurich and spend
the night and come see me in the morning.’
‘and then what?’
doctor dohmler spread his hands wide enough to carry
a young pig.
‘chicago,’ he suggested.

‘then we knew where we stood,’ said franz. ‘dohmler told
warren we would take the case if he would agree to keep
away from his daughter indefinitely, with an absolute minimum
of five years. after warren’s first collapse, he seemed
chiefly concerned as to whether the story would ever leak
back to america.’

was easy to slide into a phantom world where all men, the
more you liked them and trusted them, the more evil—‘
‘did she ever go into the—horror directly?’
‘no, and as a matter of fact when she began to seem normal,
about october, we were in a predicament. if she had
been thirty years old we would have let her make her own
adjustment, but she was so young we were afraid she might
harden with it all twisted inside her. so doctor dohmler
said to her frankly, ‘your duty now is to yourself. this
doesn’t by any account mean the end of anything for you—
your life is just at its beginning,’ and so forth and so forth.
she really has an excellent mind, so he gave her a little freud
to read, not too much, and she was very interested. in fact,
we’ve made rather a pet of her around here. but she is reticent,’
he added; he hesitated: ‘we have wondered if in her
recent letters to you which she mailed herself from zurich,

franz waited a moment.
‘how about our patient?’ he asked.
‘i don’t know.’
‘well, you should know about her by now.’
‘i like her. she’s attractive. what do you want me to do—
take her up in the edelweiss?’
‘no, i thought since you go in for scientific books you
might have an idea.’
‘—devote my life to her?’
franz called his wife in the kitchen: ‘du lieber gott!
bitte, bringe dick noch ein glas-bier.’
‘i don’t want any more if i’ve got to see dohmler.’
‘we think it’s best to have a program. four weeks have
passed away—apparently the girl is in love with you. that’s
not our business if we were in the world, but here in the
clinic we have a stake in the matter.’
‘i’ll do whatever doctor dohmler says,’ dick agreed.
but he had little faith that dohmler would throw much
light on the matter; he himself was the incalculable element
involved. by no conscious volition of his own, the thing had
drifted into his hands. it reminded hi

the handkerchiefs in his mother’s top drawer; at that
time he had experienced a philosophical detachment, and
this was repeated now when he and franz went together to
professor dohmler’s office.
the professor, his face beautiful under straight whiskers,
like a vine-overgrown veranda of some fine old house, disarmed
him. dick knew some individuals with more talent,
but no person of a class qualitatively superior to dohmler.
—six months later he thought the same way when he saw
dohmler dead, the light out on the veranda, the vines of his
whiskers tickling his stiff white collar, the many battles that
had swayed before the chink-like eyes stilled forever under

‘... good morning, sir.’ he stood formally, thrown back
to the army.
professor dohmler interlaced his tranquil fingers. franz
spoke in terms half of liaison officer, half of secretary, till his
senior cut through him in mid-sentence.
‘we have gone a certain way,’ he said mildly. ‘it’s you,
doctor diver, who can best help us now.’
routed out, dick confessed: ‘i’m not so straight on it myself.’
‘i have nothing to do with your personal reactions,’ said
dohmler. ‘but i have much to do with the fact that this socalled

again franz began to speak, but doctor dohmler motioned
him silent.
‘i realize that your position has been difficult.’
‘yes, it has.’
now the professor sat back and laughed, saying on the
last syllable of his laughter, with his sharp little gray eyes
shining through: ‘perhaps you have got sentimentally involved
yourself.’
aware that he was being drawn on, dick, too, laughed.
‘she’s a pretty girl—anybody responds to that to a certain
extent. i have no intention—‘

th a question directed pointedly at dick. ‘have you
thought of going away?’
‘i can’t go away.’
doctor dohmler turned to franz: ‘then we can send
miss warren away.’
‘as you think best, professor dohmler,’ dick conceded.
‘it’s certainly a situation.’
professor dohmler raised himself like a legless man
mounting a pair of crutches.
‘but it is a professional situation,’ he cried quietly.
he sighed himself back into his chair, waiting for the reverberating
thunder to die out about the room. dick saw
that dohmler had reached his climax, and he was not sure
that he himself had survived it. when the thunder had diminished
franz managed to get his word in.
‘doctor diver is a man of fine character,’ he said. ‘i feel

without any one going away.’
‘how do you feel about that?’ professor dohmler asked
dick.
dick felt churlish in the face of the situation; at the same
time he realized in the silence after dohmler’s pronouncement
that the state of inanimation could not be indefinitely
prolonged; suddenly he spilled everything.
‘i’m half in love with her—the question of marrying her
has passed through my mind.’
‘tch! tch!’ uttered franz.
‘wait.’ dohmler warned him. franz refused to wait:
‘what! and devote half your life to being doctor and nurse
and all—never! i know what these cases are. one time in
twenty it’s finished in the first push—better never see her
again!’

it was late afternoon when they wound up the discussion
as to what dick should do, he must be most kind and
yet eliminate himself. when the doctors stood up at last,
dick’s eyes fell outside the window to where a light rain was
falling—nicole was waiting, expectant, somewhere in that
rain. when, presently, he went out buttoning his oil-skin at
the throat, pulling down the brim of his hat, he came upon
her im

‘i understand.’
‘this has been an awfully exciting day.’
‘i know.’
‘i don’t want to do anything anti-social—i’ve caused
everybody enough trouble. but to-night i wanted to get
away.’
it occurred to dick suddenly, as it might occur to a dying
man that he had forgotten to tell where his will was, that
nicole had been ‘re-educated’ by dohmler and the ghostly
generations behind him; it occurred to him also that there
would be so much she would have to be told. but having
recorded this wisdom within himself, he yielded to the insistent
face-value of the situation and said:
‘you’re a nice person—just keep using your own judgment
about yourself.’
‘you like me?’
‘of course.’
‘would you—‘ they were strolling along toward the dim

the following morning, amused by the fact that his conductor
of the day before was using his day off to climb also.
then dick descended all the way to montreux for a
swim, got back to his hotel in time for dinner. two notes
awaited him.
‘i’m not ashamed about last night—it was the nicest thing
that ever happened to me and even if i never saw you again,
mon capitaine, i would be glad it happened.’
that was disarming enough—the heavy shade of dohmler
retreated as dick opened the second envelope:
dear doctor diver: i phoned but you were out. i
wonder if i may ask you a great big favor. unforeseen circumstances
call me back to paris, and i find i can make
better time by way of lausanne. can you let nicole ride as
far as zurich with you, since you are going back monday?
and drop her at the sanitarium? is this too much to ask?

so that he and dick have begun to disapprove of each other.

half an hour later dick started up to the administration
building. he was thirty-eight—still declining a beard
he yet had a more medical aura about him than he had
worn upon the riviera. for eighteen months now he had
lived at the clinic—certainly one of the best-appointed in
europe. like dohmler’s it was of the modern type—no
longer a single dark and sinister building but a small, scattered,
yet deceitfully integrated village—dick and nicole
had added much in the domain of taste, so that the plant
was a thing of beauty, visited by every psychologist passing
through zurich. with the addition of a caddy house it
might very well have been a country club. the eglantine
and the beeches, houses for those sunk into eternal darkness,
were screened by little copses from the main building,

inevitably they dined together.

‘birds in their little nests agree,’ franz thundered. finding
the tone inappropriate to the sentiment he repeated his
command in the spaced and considered rhythm with which
his old master, doctor dohmler, could cast significance on
the tritest platitude. ‘birds— in—their—nests—agree!’

he got up and, as he absorbed the situation, his selfknowledge
assured him that he would undertake to deal
with it—the old fatal pleasingness, the old forceful charm,
swept back with its cry of ‘use me!’ he would have to go fix
this thing that he didn’t care a damn about, because it had
early become a habit to be loved, perhaps from the moment
when he had realized that he was the last hope of a decaying
clan. on an almost parallel occasion, back in dohmler’s
clinic on the zurichsee, realizing this power, he had made
his choice, chosen ophelia, chosen the sweet poison and
drunk it. wanting above all to be brave and kind, he had
wanted, even more than that, to be loved. so it had been. so
it would ever be, he saw, simultaneously with the slow archaic
tinkle from the phone box as he rang off.
there was a long pause. nicole called, ‘what is it? who
