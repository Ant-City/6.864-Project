with which general ivolgin greeted him irritated him anew; he frowned,
and decided to be absolutely silent.

as to the rest, one was a man of thirty, the retired officer, now a
boxer, who had been with rogojin, and in his happier days had given
fifteen roubles at a time to beggars. evidently he had joined the others
as a comrade to give them moral, and if necessary material, support. the
man who had been spoken of as “pavlicheff’s son,” although he gave the
name of antip burdovsky, was about twenty-two years of age, fair,
thin and rather tall. he was remarkable for the poverty, not to say
uncleanliness, of his personal appearance: the sleeves of his overcoat
were greasy; his dirty waistcoat, buttoned up to his neck, showed not a
trace of linen; a filthy black silk scarf, twisted till it resembled a
cord, was round his neck, and his hands were unwashed. he looked round
with an air of insolent effrontery. his face, covered with pimples,
was neither thoughtful nor even cont

persistently, and panted for breath; it looked as though he had but
a few weeks more to live. he was nearly dead with fatigue, and fell,
rather than sat, into a chair. the rest bowed as they came in; and being
more or less abashed, put on an air of extreme self-assurance. in short,
their attitude was not that which one would have expected in men who
professed to despise all trivialities, all foolish mundane conventions,
and indeed everything, except their own personal interests.

“antip burdovsky,” stuttered the son of pavlicheff.

“vladimir doktorenko,” said lebedeff’s nephew briskly, and with a
certain pride, as if he boasted of his name.

“keller,” murmured the retired officer.

“hippolyte terentieff,” cried the last-named, in a shrill voice.

they sat now in a row facing the prince, and frowned, and played with
their caps. all appeared ready to speak, and yet all were silent; the
defiant expression on their faces seemed to say, “no, sir, you don’t
take us in!”

it could be felt that the first word spoken by anyone
present would bring a torrent of speech from the whole deputation.

“i _did_ not expect you, gentlemen,” began the prince. “i have been ill
until to-day. a month ago,” he continued, addressing himself to antip
burdovsky, “i put your business into gavrila ardalionovitch ivolgin’s
hands, as i told you then. i do not in the least object to having a
personal interview... but you will agree with me that this is hardly the
time... i propose that we go into another room, if you will not keep me
long... as you see, i have friends here, and believe me...”

“friends as many as you please, but allow me,” interrupted the harsh
voice of lebedeff’s nephew--“allow me to tell you that you might have

ather more politely, and not have kept us waiting at least
two hours...

“no doubt... and i... is that acting like a prince? and you... you may
be a general! but i... i am not your valet! and i... i...” stammered
antip burdovsky.

he was extremely excited; his lips trembled, and the resentment of an
embittered soul was in his voice. but he spoke so indistinctly that
hardly a dozen words could be gathered.

“it was a princely action!” sneered hippolyte.

“if anyone had treated me so,” grumbled the boxer.

“i mean to say that if i had been in burdovsky’s place...i...”

“gentlemen, i did not know you were there; i have only just been
informed, i assure you,” repeated muishkin.

“we are not afraid of yo

ur friends, prince,” remarked lebedeff’s nephew,
“for we are within our rights.”

the shrill tones of hippolyte interrupted him. “what right have you...
by what right do you demand us to submit this matter, about burdovsky...
to the judgment of your friends? we know only too well what the judgment
of your friends will be!...”

this beginning gave promise of a stormy discussion. the prince was
much discouraged, but at last he managed to make himself heard amid the
vociferations of his excited visitors.

“if you,” he said, addressing burdovsky--“if you prefer not to speak
here, i offer again to go into another room with you... and as to your
waiting to see me, i repeat that i only this instant heard...”

“well, you have no right, you have no right, no right at all!... your
friends indeed!”... gabbled burdovsky, defiantly examining the faces
round him, and becoming more and more excited. “you have no right!...”
 as he ended thus abruptly, he leant forward, staring at the prince with
his short-sighted, bloodshot eyes. the latter was so astonished, that he
did not reply, but looked steadily at him in return.

“lef nicolaievitch!” interposed madame epanchin, suddenly, “read this at

she held out a weekly comic paper, pointing to an article o

surprised if any one of you could have written it.”

“i did not know of its existence till this moment,” declared hippolyte.
“i do not approve of it.”

“i knew it had been written, but i would not have advised its
publication,” said lebedeff’s nephew, “because it is premature.”

“i knew it, but i have a right. i... i...” stammered the “son of
pavlicheff.”

“what! did you write all that yourself? is it possible?” asked the
prince, regarding burdovsky with curiosity.

“one might dispute your right to ask such questions,” observed
lebedeff’s nephew.

“i was only surprised that mr. burdovsky should have--however, this is
what i have to say. since you had already given the matter publicity,
why did you object just now, when i began to speak of it to my friends?”

“at last!” murmured lizabetha prokofievna indignantly.

lebedeff could restrain himself no longer; he made his way through the
row of chairs.

heads as befits independent men. we present no petition, but a proud and

fairly and squarely in a dignified manner. do you believe that in this

pavlicheff overwhelmed you with benefits, and perhaps saved your life?

are a millionaire, and do you not think it in conformity with justice,
to indemnify burdovsky? yes or no? if it is yes, or, in other words, if
you possess what you call honour and conscience, and we more justly call
common-sense, then accede to our demand, and the matter is at an end.

have put the question before you. now turn us out if you dare. you can
do it; force is on your side. but remember that we do not beseech, we
demand! we do not beseech, we demand!”

with these last excited words, lebedeff’s nephew was silent.

“we demand, we demand, we demand, we do not beseech,” spluttered
burdovsky, red as a lobster.

the speech of lebedeff’s nephew caused a certain stir among the company;
murmurs arose, though with the exception of lebedeff, who was still
very much excited, everyone was careful not to interfere in the matter.
strangely enough, lebedeff, although on the prince’s side, seemed quite
proud of his nephew’s eloquence. gratified vanity was visible in the
glances he cast upon the assembled company.

you already that we none of us approve of it! there is the writer,” he
added, pointing to the boxer, who sat beside him. “i quite admit that he
has written it in his old regimental manner, with an equal disregard
for style and decency. i know he is a cross between a fool and an
adventurer; i make no bones about telling him so to his face every day.
but after all he is half justified; publicity is the lawful right of
every man; consequently, burdovsky is not excepted. let him answer for
his own blunders. as to the objection which i made just now in the name
of all, to the presence of your friends, i think i ought to explain,
gentlemen, that i only did so to assert our rights, though we really
wished to have witnesses; we had agreed unanimously upon the point
before we came in. we do not care who your witnesses may be, or
whether they are your friends or not. as they cannot fail to recognize

n by making such a fuss about it?”
 asked the astonished prince.

the boxer was dying to get in a few words; owing, no doubt, to the
presence of the ladies, he was becoming quite jovial.

“as to the article, prince,” he said, “i admit that i wrote it, in spite
of the severe criticism of my poor friend, in whom i always overlook
many things because of his unfortunate state of health. but i wrote and
published it in the form of a letter, in the paper of a friend. i showed
it to no one but burdovsky, and i did not read it all through, even to
him. he immediately gave me permission to publish it, but you will admit
that i might have done so without his consent. publicity is a noble,
beneficent, and universal right. i hope, prince, that you are too
progressive to deny this?”

“i deny nothing, but you must confess that your article--”

“is a bit thick, you mean? well, in a way that is in the public
interest; you will admit that yourself, and after all one cannot
overlook a blatant fac

 motive, aim, and intention, are the chief thing. it is a
question, above all, of making a wholesome example; the individual case
can be examined afterwards; and as to the style--well, the thing was
meant to be humorous, so to speak, and, after all, everybody writes like
that; you must admit it yourself! ha, ha!”

“but, gentlemen, i assure you that you are quite astray,” exclaimed the
prince. “you have published this article upon the supposition that i
would never consent to satisfy mr. burdovsky. acting on that conviction,
you have tried to intimidate me by this publication and to be revenged
for my supposed refusal. but what did you know of my intentions? it may
be that i have resolved to satisfy mr. burdovsky’s claim. i now declare
openly, in the presence of these witnesses, that i will do so.”

“the noble and intelligent word of an intelligent and most noble man, at
last!” exclaimed the boxer.

“good god!” exclaimed lizabetha prokofievna involuntarily.

“this is intole

rable,” growled the general.

“allow me, gentlemen, allow me,” urged the prince.

“i will explain matters to you. five weeks ago i received a visit from
tchebaroff, your agent, mr. burdovsky. you have given a very flattering
description of him in your article, mr. keller,” he continued, turning
to the boxer with a smile, “but he did not please me at all. i saw at
once that tchebaroff was the moving spirit in the matter, and, to speak
frankly, i thought he might have induced you, mr. burdovsky, to make
this claim, by taking advantage of your simplicity.”

“you have no right.... i am not simple,” stammered burdovsky, much
agitated.

“you have no sort of right to suppose such things,” said lebedeff’s
nephew in a tone of authority.

“it is most offensive!” shrieked hippolyte; “it is an insulting
suggestion, false, and most ill-timed.”

“i beg your pardon, gentlemen; please excuse me,” said the prince. “i
thought absolute frankness on both sides would be best, b

ut have it your
own way. i told tchebaroff that, as i was not in petersburg, i would
commission a friend to look into the matter without delay, and that i
would let you know, mr. burdovsky. gentlemen, i have no hesitation in
telling you that it was the fact of tchebaroff’s intervention that made
me suspect a fraud. oh! do not take offence at my words, gentlemen,
for heaven’s sake do not be so touchy!” cried the prince, seeing that
burdovsky was getting excited again, and that the rest were preparing
to protest. “if i say i suspected a fraud, there is nothing personal in
that. i had never seen any of you then; i did not even know your names;
i only judged by tchebaroff; i am speaking quite generally--if you only
knew how i have been ‘done’ since i came into my fortune!”

“you are shockingly naive, prince,” said lebedeff’s nephew in mocking
tones.

“besides, though you are a prince and a millionaire, and even though

received the news with mistrust, then i said to myself that i might be
mistaken, and that pavlicheff might possibly have had a son. but i was
absolutely amazed at the readiness with which the son had revealed
the secret of his birth at the expense of his mother’s honour. for
tchebaroff had already menaced me with publicity in our interview....”

“what nonsense!” lebedeff’s nephew interrupted violently.

“you have no right--you have no right!” cried burdovsky.

“the son is not responsible for the misdeeds of his father; and the
mother is not to blame,” added hippolyte, with warmth.

“that seems to me all the more reason for sparing her,” said the prince
timidly.

“prince, you are not only simple, but your simplicity is almost past the
limit,” said lebedeff’s nephew, with a sarcastic smile.

“but what right had you?” said hippolyte in a very strange tone.

“none--none whatever,” agreed the prince hastily. “i admit you are righ

there, but it was involuntary, and i immediately said to myself that my
personal feelings had nothing to do with it,--that if i thought it right
to satisfy the demands of mr. burdovsky, out of respect for the memory
of pavlicheff, i ought to do so in any case, whether i esteemed mr.
burdovsky or not. i only mentioned this, gentlemen, because it seemed so
unnatural to me for a son to betray his mother’s secret in such a way.
in short, that is what convinced me that tchebaroff must be a rogue, and
that he had induced mr. burdovsky to attempt this fraud.”

“but this is intolerable!” cried the visitors, some of them starting to
their feet.

“gentlemen, i supposed from this that poor mr. burdovsky must be a

influence of tchebaroff, and secondly by making myself his friend. i
have resolved to give him ten thousand roubles; that is about the sum
which i calculate that pavlicheff must have spent on me.”

“what, only ten thousand!” cried hippolyte.

“well, prince, your arithmetic is not up to much, or else you are mighty
clever at it, though you affect the air of a simpleton,” said lebedeff’s
nephew.

“i will not accept ten thousand roubles,” said burdovsky.

“accept, antip,” whispered the boxer eagerly, leaning past the back of
hippolyte’s chair to give his friend this piece of advice. “take it for
the present; we can see about more later on.”

“look here, mr. muishkin,” shouted hippolyte, “please understand that we
are not fools, nor idiots, as your guests seem to imagine; these ladies
who look upon us with such scorn, and especially this fine gentleman”

and was very far from costing tens of thousands of
roubles. schneider received six hundred roubles a year, and he was
only paid for the first three years. as to the pretty governesses whom
pavlicheff is supposed to have brought from paris, they only exist
in mr. keller’s imagination; it is another calumny. according to my
calculations, the sum spent on me was very considerably under ten
thousand roubles, but i decided on that sum, and you must admit that
in paying a debt i could not offer mr. burdovsky more, however kindly
disposed i might be towards him; delicacy forbids it; i should seem to
be offering him charity instead of rightful payment. i don’t know how
you cannot see that, gentlemen! besides, i had no intention of leaving
the matter there. i meant to intervene amicably later on and help to
improve poor mr. burdovsky’s position. it is clear that he has been
deceived, or he would never have agreed to anything so vile as the
scandalous revelations about his mother in mr. keller’s

with increasing eagerness.

he meant to calm his hearers, and did not perceive that his words had
only increased their irritation.

“what do you mean? what are you convinced of?” they demanded angrily.

“in the first place, i have had the opportunity of getting a correct
idea of mr. burdovsky. i see what he is for myself. he is an innocent
man, deceived by everyone! a defenceless victim, who deserves
indulgence! secondly, gavrila ardalionovitch, in whose hands i had
placed the matter, had his first interview with me barely an hour ago.
i had not heard from him for some time, as i was away, and have been ill
for three days since my return to st. petersburg. he tells me that he
has exposed the designs of tchebaroff and has proof that justifies my
opinion of him. i know, gentlemen, tha

counting upon my reputation as a man whose purse-strings are easily
loosened, tchebaroff thought it would be a simple matter to fleece me,
especially by trading on my gratitude to pavlicheff. but the main
point is--listen, gentlemen, let me finish!--the main point is that mr.
burdovsky is not pavlicheff’s son at all. gavrila ardalionovitch has
just told me of his discovery, and assures me that he has positive
proofs. well, what do you think of that? it is scarcely credible, even
after all the tricks that have been played upon me. please note that we
have positive proofs! i can hardly believe it myself, i assure you; i do
not yet believe it; i am still doubtful, because gavrila ardalionovitch
has not had time to go into details; but there can be no further doubt

all of you, gentlemen, who have come forward so nobly to support your
friend--(he evidently needs support, i quite see that!). he has abused
your credulity and involved you all in an attempted fraud, for when all
is said and done this claim is nothing else!”

“what! a fraud? what, he is not pavlicheff’s son? impossible!”

these exclamations but feebly expressed the profound bewilderment into
which the prince’s words had plunged burdovsky’s companions.

“certainly it is a fraud! since mr. burdovsky is not pavlicheff’s son,
his claim is neither more nor less than attempted fraud (supposing, of
course, that he had known the truth), but the fact is that he has been
deceived. i insist on this point in order to justify him; i repeat that
his simple-mindedness makes him worthy of pity, and that he cannot stand
alone; otherwise he would have behaved like a scoundrel in this matter.

yet i will keep to my decision, and i am prepared to give up ten

burdovsky, because, though he was not
pavlicheff’s son, he was treated almost as though he were. that is
what gave a rogue the opportunity of deceiving him; he really did
think himself pavlicheff’s son. listen, gentlemen; this matter must
be settled; keep calm; do not get angry; and sit down! gavrila
ardalionovitch will explain everything to you at once, and i confess
that i am very anxious to hear all the details myself. he says that he
has even been to pskoff to see your mother, mr. burdovsky; she is not
dead, as the article which was just read to us makes out. sit down,
gentlemen, sit down!”

the prince sat down, and at length prevailed upon burdovsky’s company
to do likewise. during the last ten or twenty minutes, exasperated by
continual interruptions, he had raised his voice, and spoken with
great vehemence. now, no doubt, he bitterly regretted several words and
expressions which had escaped him in his excitement. if he had not been
driven beyond the limits of endurance, he

would not have ventured to
express certain conjectures so openly. he had no sooner sat down than
his heart was torn by sharp remorse. besides insulting burdovsky
with the supposition, made in the presence of witnesses, that he was
suffering from the complaint for which he had himself been treated
in switzerland, he reproached himself with the grossest indelicacy in
having offered him the ten thousand roubles before everyone. “i ought
to have waited till to-morrow and offered him the money when we were
alone,” thought muishkin. “now it is too late, the mischief is done!
yes, i am an idiot, an absolute idiot!” he said to himself, overcome

me and regret.

till then gavrila ardalionovitch had sat apart in silence. when the
prince called upon him, he came and stood by his side, and in a calm,
clear voice began to render an account of the mission confided to him.
all conversation ceased instantly. everyone, especially the burdovsky
party, listened with the utmost curiosity.

“you will not deny, i am sure,” said gavrila ardalionovitch, turning
to burdovsky, who sat looking at him with wide-open eyes, perplexed and
astonished. you will not deny, seriously, that you were born just two
years after your mother’s legal marriage to mr. burdovsky, your father.
nothing would be easier than to prove the date of your birth from
well-known facts; we can only look on mr. keller’s version as a work of
imagination, and one, moreover, extremely offensive both to you and your
mother. of course he distorted the truth in order to strengthen your
claim, and to

letters now; i am content to state the fact. but if you desire it, come
to me tomorrow morning, bring witnesses and writing experts with you,
and i will prove the absolute truth of my story. from that moment the
question will be decided.”

these words caused a sensation among the listeners, and there was a
general movement of relief. burdovsky got up abruptly.

“if that is true,” said he, “i have been deceived, grossly deceived, but
not by tchebaroff: and for a long time past, a long time. i do not
wish for experts, not i, nor to go to see you. i believe you. i give it
up.... but i refuse the ten thousand roubles. good-bye.”

“wait five minutes more, mr. burdovsky,” said gavrila ardalionovitch
pleasantly. “i have more to say. some rather curious and important facts
have come to light, and it is absolutely necessary, in

my opinion, that
you should hear them. you will not regret, i fancy, to have the whole
matter thoroughly cleared up.”

burdovsky silently resumed his seat, and bent his head as though in
profound thought. his friend, lebedeff’s nephew, who had risen to
accompany him, also sat down again. he seemed much disappointed, though
as self-confident as ever. hippolyte looked dejected and sulky, as well
as surprised. he had just been attacked by a violent fit of coughing,
so that his handkerchief was stained with blood. the boxer looked
thoroughly frightened.

“oh, antip!” cried he in a miserable voice, “i did say to you t

other day--the day before yesterday--that perhaps you were not really
pavlicheff’s son!”

there were sounds of half-smothered laughter at this.

“now, that is a valuable piece of information, mr. keller,” replied
gania. “however that may be, i have private information which convinces
me that mr. burdovsky, though doubtless aware of the date of his birth,
knew nothing at all about pavlicheff’s sojourn abroad. indeed, he passed
the greater part of his life out of russia, returning at intervals for
short visits. the journey in question is in itself too unimportant for
his friends to recollect it after more than twenty years; and of course
mr. burdovsky could have known nothing about it, for he was not born.

absence, though i m

impossible for burdovsky or tchebaroff to discover these facts, even if

here the voice of hippolyte suddenly intervened.

“allow me, mr. ivolgin,” he said irritably. “what is the good of all
this rigmarole? pardon me. all is now clear, and we acknowledge the
truth of your main point. why go into these tedious details? you wish
perhaps to boast of the cleverness of your investigation, to cry up your

insult! the affair is quite painful enough for him without that. will
nothing make you understand?”

“enough! enough! mr. terentieff,” interrupted gania.

“don’t excite yourself; you seem very ill, and i am sorry for that. i am
almost done, but there are a few facts to which i must briefly refer, as
i am convinced that they ought to be clearly explained once for all....”

n his audience as he resumed: “i
merely wish to state, for the information of all concerned, that the
reason for mr. pavlicheff’s interest in your mother, mr. burdovsky, was
simply that she was the sister of a serf-girl with whom he was deeply in
love in his youth, and whom most certainly he would have married but for
her sudden death. i have proofs that this circumstance is almost, if not
quite, forgotten. i may add that when your mother was about ten years
old, pavlicheff took her under his care, gave her a good education, and
later, a considerable dowry. his relations were alarmed, and feared
he might go so far as to marry her, but she gave her hand to a yo

can even say definitely that it was a marriage of affection. after his
wedding your father gave up his occupation as land-surveyor, and with
his wife’s dowry of fifteen thousand roubles went in for commercial
speculations. as he had had no experience, he was cheated on all sides,
and took to drink in order to forget his troubles. he shortened his life
by his excesses, and eight years after his marriage he died. your mother

also had the advantage of special teachers--his relations and servants
grew to believe that you were his son, and that your father had been
betrayed by his wife. i may point out that this idea was only accredited
generally during the last years of pavlicheff’s life, when his
next-of-kin were trembling about the succession, when the earlier story
was quite forgotten, and when all opportunity for discovering the truth
had seemingly passed away. no doubt you, mr. burdovsky, heard this
conjecture, and did not hesitate to accept it as true. i have had the
honour of making your mother’s acquaintance, and i find that she knows
all about these reports. what she does not know is that you, her son,
should have listened to them so complaisantly. i found your respected
mother at pskoff, ill and in deep poverty, as she has been ever since
the death of your benefactor. she told me with tears of gratitude how
you had supported her; she expects much of you, and believes fer

“oh, this is unbearable!” said lebedeff’s nephew impatiently. “what is
the good of all this romancing?”

“it is revolting and unseemly!” cried hippolyte, jumping up in a fury.

burdovsky alone sat silent and motionless.

“what is the good of it?” repeated gavrila ardalionovitch, with
pretended surprise. “well, firstly, because now perhaps mr. burdovsky
is quite convinced that mr. pavlicheff’s love for him came simply from
generosity of soul, and not from paternal duty. it was most necessary
to impress this fact upon his mind, considering that he approved of the
article written by mr. keller. i speak thus because i look on you, mr.
burdovsky, as an honourable man. secondly, it appears that there was no
intention of cheating in this case, even on the part of tchebaroff. i
wish to say this quite plainly, because the prince hinted a while
ago t

yone has been quite sincere in the matter, and although
tchebaroff may be somewhat of a rogue, in this business he has acted
simply as any sharp lawyer would do under the circumstances. he looked
at it as a case that might bring him in a lot of money, and he did not
calculate badly; because on the one hand he speculated on the generosity
of the prince, and his gratitude to the late mr. pavlicheff, and on
the other to his chivalrous ideas as to the obligations of honour and
conscience. as to mr. burdovsky, allowing for his principles, we may
acknowledge that he engaged in the business with very little personal
aim in view. at the instigation of tchebaroff and his other friends,
he decided to make the attempt in the service of truth, progress, and
humanity. in short, the conclusion may be drawn that, in spite of all
appearances, mr. burdovsky is a man of irreproachable character, and
thus the prince can all the more readily offer him his friendship, and
the assistance of which he spoke just now..

“hush! hush! gavrila ardalionovitch!” cried muishkin in dismay, but it
was too late.

“i said, and i have repeated it over and over again,” shouted burdovsky
furiously, “that i did not want the money. i will not take it... why...i
will not... i am going away!”

he was rushing hurriedly from the terrace, when lebedeff’s nephew seized
his arms, and said something to him in a low voice. burdovsky turned
quickly, and drawing an addressed but unsealed envelope from his pocket,
he threw it down on a little table beside the prince.

“there’s the money!... how dare you?... the money!”

“those are the two hundred and fifty roubles you dared to send him as a
charity, by the hands of tchebaroff,” explained doktorenko.

“the article in the newspaper put it at fifty!” cried colia.

“i beg your pardon,” said the prince, going up to burdovsky. “i have
done you a great wrong, but

“why, no, it is hardly the same,” remarked gavrila ardalionovitch, with
an air of ingenuous surprise.

“don’t interrupt, we are not such fools as you think, mr. lawyer,” cried
lebedeff’s nephew angrily. “of course there is a difference between
a hundred roubles and two hundred and fifty, but in this case the
principle is the main point, and that a hundred and fifty roubles
are missing is only a side issue. the point to be emphasized is that
burdovsky will not accept your highness’s charity; he flings it back in
your face, and it scarcely matters if there are a hundred roubles or two
hundred and fifty. burdovsky has refused ten thousand roubles; you
heard him. he would not have returned even a hundred roubles if he was
dishonest! the hundred and fifty roubles were paid to tchebaroff for
his travelling expenses. you may jeer at our stupidity and at our
inexperience in business matters; you have done all you could already to

me alone, will you?” she cried violently to those around her, who were
trying to keep her quiet. “no, evgenie pavlovitch, if, as you said

natural that a man should murder six people because he was in misery,
the world must be coming to an end. i had not heard of it before. now
i understand everything. and this stutterer, won’t he turn out a
murderer?” she cried, pointing to burdovsky, who was staring at her with
stupefaction. “i bet he will! he will have none of your money, possibly,
he will refuse it because his conscience will not allow him to accept
it, but he will go murdering you by night and walking off with your
cashbox, with a clear conscience! he does not call it a dishonest action

had not recovered from their surprise, but it was now mingled with
satisfaction; in short, everyone seemed very much relieved that
lizabetha prokofievna had got over her paroxysm. aglaya alone still
frowned, and sat apart in silence. all the other guests stayed on as
well; no one wanted to go, not even general ivolgin, but lebedeff said
something to him in passing which did not seem to please him, for he
immediately went and sulked in a corner. the prince took care to offer
tea to burdovsky and his friends as well as the rest. the invitation
made them rather uncomfortable. they muttered that they would wait for
hippolyte, and went and sat by themselves in a distant corner of the
verandah. tea was served at once; lebedeff had no doubt ordered it
for himself and his family before the others arrived. it was striking

added suddenly to prince s. “alexandra, my dear, come here! your hair is
coming down.”

she arranged her daughter’s hair, which was not in the least disordered,
and gave her a kiss. this was all that she had called her for.

“i thought you were capable of development,” said hippolyte, coming out
of his fit of abstraction. “yes, that is what i meant to say,” he added,
with the satisfaction of one who suddenly remembers something he had
forgotten. “here is burdovsky, sincerely anxious to protect his mother;
is not that so? and he himself is the cause of her disgrace. the prince
is anxious to help burdovsky and offers him friendship and a large sum
of money, in the sincerity of his heart. and here they stand like two
sworn enemies--ha, ha, ha! you all hate burdovsky because his behaviour
with regard to his mother is shocking and repugnant to you; do you not?
is not that true? is it not true? you all have a passion for beauty and
distinction in outward forms

secretly to burdovsky’s mother through gania. well, i bet now,” he
continued with an hysterical laugh, “that burdovsky will accuse you of
indelicacy, and reproach you with a want of respect for his mother! yes,
that is quite certain! ha, ha, ha!”

he caught his breath, and began to cough once more.

“come, that is enough! that is all now; you have no more to say? now
go to bed; you are burning with fever,” said lizabetha prokofievna
impatiently. her anxious eyes had never left the invalid. “good heavens,

the exclusion of everything else; perhaps even before having discovered
what constitutes the right. i may be mistaken?”

“you are certainly mistaken; i do not even understand you. what else?”

murmurs arose in the neighbourhood of burdovsky and his companions;
lebedeff’s nephew protested under his breath.

almost in a fever. moreover, anew trouble, almost a fear, showed itself
in his eyes; he watched hippolyte anxiously as if expecting something
further.

suddenly hippolyte arose. his face, shockingly pale, was that of a man
overwhelmed with shame and despair. this was shown chiefly in the look
of fear and hatred which he cast upon the assembled company, and in the
wild smile upon his trembling lips. then he cast down his eyes, and with
the same smile, staggered towards burdovsky and doktorenko, who stood at
the entrance to the verandah. he had decided to go with them.

“there! that is what i feared!” cried the prince. “it was inevitable!”

hippolyte turned upon him, a prey to maniacal rage, which set all the
muscles of his face quivering.

“ah! that is what you feared! it was inevitable, you say! well, let me
tell you that if i hate anyone here--i hate you all,” he cried, in a
hoarse, strained voice--“but you, you, with your jesuitical soul, your

onovitch had
promised to visit muishkin, who eagerly awaited his coming.

about seven in the evening, soon after dinner, he arrived. at the first
glance it struck the prince that he, at any rate, must know all the
details of last night’s affair. indeed, it would have been impossible
for him to remain in ignorance considering the intimate relationship
between him, varvara ardalionovna, and ptitsin. but although he and the
prince were intimate, in a sense, and although the latter had placed
the burdovsky affair in his hands--and this was not the only mark of
confidence he had received--it seemed curious how many matters there
were that were tacitly avoided in their conversations. muishkin thought
that gania at times appeared to desire more cordiality and frankness.
it was apparent now, when he entered, that he was convinced that the
moment for breaking the ice between them had come at last.

but all the same gania was in haste, for his sister was waiting at

hat something was wrong.

lebedeff ran up promptly to explain the arrival of all these gentlemen.
he was himself somewhat intoxicated, but the prince gathered from his
long-winded periods that the party had assembled quite naturally, and
accidentally.

first of all hippolyte had arrived, early in the evening, and feeling
decidedly better, had determined to await the prince on the verandah.
there lebedeff had joined him, and his household had followed--that is,
his daughters and general ivolgin. burdovsky had brought hippolyte, and
stayed on with him. gania and ptitsin had dropped in accidentally later
on; then came keller, and he and colia insisted on having champagne.
evgenie pavlovitch had only dropped in half an hour or so ago. lebedeff
had served the champagne readily.

“my own though, prince, my own, mind,” he said, “and there’ll be some
supper later on; my daughter is getting it ready now. come and sit down,
prince, we are all waiting for you, we want you with us. fancy what we

immediately after greeting vera.

“and how do you know that i am ‘so happy’?

“i can see it by your face! say ‘how do you do’ to the others, and
come and sit down here, quick--i’ve been waiting for you!” he added,
accentuating the fact that he had waited. on the prince’s asking, “will
it not be injurious to you to sit out so late?” he replied that he could
not believe that he had thought himself dying three days or so ago, for
he never had felt better than this evening.

burdovsky next jumped up and explained that he had come in by accident,
having escorted hippolyte from town. he murmured that he was glad he
had “written nonsense” in his letter, and then pressed the prince’s hand
warmly and sat down again.

the prince approached evgenie pavlovitch last of all. the latter
immediately took his arm.

“i have a couple of words to say to you,” he began, “and those on a very
important matter; let’s go aside for a minute or two.”

“just a couple of words!”

orth while living for a few weeks took
possession of me a month ago, when i was told that i had four weeks to
live, but only partially so at that time. the idea quite overmastered me
three days since, that evening at pavlofsk. the first time that i felt
really impressed with this thought was on the terrace at the prince’s,
at the very moment when i had taken it into my head to make a last trial
of life. i wanted to see people and trees (i believe i said so myself),
i got excited, i maintained burdovsky’s rights, ‘my neighbour!’--i
dreamt that one and all would open their arms, and embrace me, that
there would be an indescribable exchange of forgiveness between us all!
in a word, i behaved like a fool, and then, at that very same instant, i
felt my ‘last conviction.’ i ask myself now how i could have waited six
months for that conviction! i knew that i had a disease that spares
no one, and i really had no illusions; but the more i realized my
condition, the more i clung to life; i wa

of his hands in a torment of alarm. “what are you thinking of? he said
he would blow his brains out at sunrise.”

“oh, he won’t shoot himself!” cried several voices, sarcastically.

“gentlemen, you’d better look out,” cried colia, also seizing hippolyte
by the hand. “just look at him! prince, what are you thinking of?” vera
and colia, and keller, and burdovsky were all crowding round hippolyte
now and holding him down.

“he has the right--the right--” murmured burdovsky. “excuse me, prince,
but what are your arrangements?” asked lebedeff, tipsy and exasperated,
going up to muishkin.

“what do you mean by ‘arrangements’?”

“no, no, excuse me! i’m master of this house, though i do not wish to
lack respect towards you. you are master of the house too, in a way; but
i can’t allow this sort of thing--”

required--and, that, in the heat of the moment, he had forgotten all
about it. he threw himself upon the prince, then on evgenie pavlovitch.
he entreated keller to give him back the pistol, and he’d soon show them
all that “his honour--his honour,”--but he was “dishonoured, now, for
ever!”

he fell senseless at last--and was carried into the prince’s study.

lebedeff, now quite sobered down, sent for a doctor; and he and his
daughter, with burdovsky and general ivolgin, remained by the sick man’s
couch.

when he was carried away unconscious, keller stood in the middle of the
room, and made the following declaration to the company in general, in a
loud tone of voice, with emphasis upon each word.

“gentlemen, if any one of you casts any doubt again, before me,
upon hippolyte’s good faith, or hints that the cap was forgotten
intentionally, or suggests that this unhappy boy was acting a part
before us, i beg to announce that the person

confession to aglaya ivanovna?”

“yes, i did; i am thinking of it.”

“in connection with ‘the ten,’ eh?” laughed evgenie, as he left the
room.

an hour later, towards four o’clock, the prince went into the park.
he had endeavoured to fall asleep, but could not, owing to the painful
beating of his heart.

he had left things quiet and peaceful; the invalid was fast asleep, and
the doctor, who had been called in, had stated that there was no special
danger. lebedeff, colia, and burdovsky were lying down in the sick-room,
ready to take it in turns to watch. there was nothing to fear,
therefore, at home.

but the prince’s mental perturbation increased every moment. he wandered
about the park, looking absently around him, and paused in astonishment
when he suddenly found himself in the empty space with the rows of
chairs round it, near the vauxhall. the look of the place struck him
as dreadful now: so he turned round and went by the path which he had
followed with the epanchins

“asleep--he’ll sleep for a couple of hours yet. i quite

agitation--excitement--all that sort of thing--quite natural, too!”

“how do you know i walked in the park and didn’t sleep at home?”

“vera just told me. she tried to persuade me not to come, but i couldn’t
help myself, just for one minute. i have been having my turn at the
bedside for the last two hours; kostia lebedeff is there now. burdovsky
has gone. now, lie down, prince, make yourself comfortable, and sleep
well! i’m awfully impressed, you know.”

“naturally, all this--”

“no, no, i mean with the ‘explanation,’ especially that part of it where
he talks about providence and a future life. there is a gigantic thought
there.”

the prince gazed affectionately at colia, who, of course, had come in
solely for the purpose of talking about this “gigantic thought.”

“but it is not any one particular thought, only; i

i never saw his pistol. he packed it himself. but he put me off my guard
like that, you see. vera says you are going to let him stay on; i swear
there’s no danger, especially as we are always with him.”

“who was by him at night?”

“i, and burdovsky, and kostia lebedeff. keller stayed a little while,
and then went over to lebedeff’s to sleep. ferdishenko slept at
lebedeff’s, too; but he went away at seven o’clock. my father is always
at lebedeff’s; but he has gone out just now. i dare say lebedeff will be
coming in here directly; he has been looking for you; i don’t know what

“i should think not. go on.”

“then it must be one of the guests.”

“is such a thing possible?”

“absolutely and utterly impossible--and yet, so it must be. but one
thing i am sure of, if it be a theft, it was committed, not in the
evening when we were all together, but either at night or early in the
morning; therefore, by one of those who slept here. burdovsky and colia

“yes, or even if they had! but who did sleep with you?”

“four of us, including myself, in two rooms. the general, myself,
keller, and ferdishenko. one of us four it must have been. i don’t
suspect myself, though such cases have been known.”

“oh! _do_ go on, lebedeff! don’t drag it out so.”

“well, there are three left, then--keller firstly. he is a drunkard

about,” said the prince, irritably, “but what are you going to do, since
you are so sure it was ferdishenko?”

“but who else _could_ it be, my very dear prince?” repeated lebedeff, as
sweet as sugar again. “if you don’t wish me to suspect mr. burdovsky?”

“of course not.”

“nor the general? ha, ha, ha!”

“nonsense!” said the prince, angrily, turning round upon him.

“quite so, nonsense! ha, ha, ha! dear me! he did amuse me, did the

 or as to
the spiritual condition of our hero at this time, we confess that we
should have great difficulty in giving the required information.

all we know is, that the marriage really was arranged, and that the
prince had commissioned lebedeff and keller to look after all the
necessary business connected with it; that he had requested them to
spare no expense; that nastasia herself was hurrying on the wedding;
that keller was to be the prince’s best man, at his own earnest request;
and that burdovsky was to give nastasia away, to his great delight. the
wedding was to take place before the middle of july.

but, besides the above, we are cognizant of certain other undoubted
facts, which puzzle us a good deal because they seem flatly to
contradict the foregoing.

we suspect, for instance, that having commissioned lebedeff and the
others, as above, the prince immediately forgot all about masters of
ceremonies and even the ceremony itself; and we feel quite certain that
in making these arrangeme

ce that day!” the prince murmured.

as nastasia philipovna had not said a word about having met rogojin
since “that day,” the prince concluded that the latter had his own
reasons for wishing to keep out of sight. all the day of the funeral our
hero was in a deeply thoughtful state, while nastasia philipovna was
particularly merry, both in the daytime and in the evening.

colia had made it up with the prince before his father’s death, and it
was he who urged him to make use of keller and burdovsky, promising
to answer himself for the former’s behaviour. nina alexandrovna and
lebedeff tried to persuade him to have the wedding in st. petersburg,
instead of in the public fashion contemplated, down here at pavlofsk
in the height of the season. but the prince only said that nastasia
philipovna desired to have it so, though he saw well enough what
prompted their arguments.

the next day keller came to visit the prince. he was in a high state of
delight with the post of honour assigned to him

 account, but
they were so busy over the arrangements for receiving the guests after
the wedding, that they had not much time for the indulgence of personal
feelings.

there were to be very few guests besides the best men and so on; only
dana alexeyevna, the ptitsins, gania, and the doctor. when the prince
asked lebedeff why he had invited the doctor, who was almost a stranger,
lebedeff replied:

“why, he wears an ‘order,’ and it looks so well!”

this idea amused the prince.

keller and burdovsky looked wonderfully correct in their dress-coats and
white kid gloves, although keller caused the bridegroom some alarm by
his undisguisedly hostile glances at the gathering crowd of sight-seers
outside.

at about half-past seven the prince started for the church in his
carriage.

we may remark here that he seemed anxious not to omit a single one of
the recognized customs and traditions observed at weddings. he wished
all to be done as openly as possible, and “in due order.”

through the crowd of spectators, amid continuous whispering and excited
exclamations. the prince stayed near the altar, while keller made off
once more to fetch the bride.

on reaching the gate of daria alexeyevna’s house, keller found a far
denser crowd than he had encountered at the prince’s. the remarks and
exclamations of the spectators here were of so irritating a nature that
keller was very near making them a speech on the impropriety of their
conduct, but was luckily caught by burdovsky, in the act of turning to
address them, and hurried indoors.

nastasia philipovna was ready. she rose from her seat, looked into the
glass and remarked, as keller told the tale afterwards, that she was “as
pale as a corpse.” she then bent her head reverently, before the ikon in
the corner, and left the room.

a torrent of voices greeted her appearance at the front door. the crowd
whistled, clapped its hands, and laughed and shouted; but in a moment or
two isolated voices were distinguishabl

rogojin seized her in his arms and almost carried her to the carriage.
then, in a flash, he tore a hundred-rouble note out of his pocket and
held it to the coachman.

“to the station, quick! if you catch the train you shall have another.
quick!”

he leaped into the carriage after nastasia and banged the door. the
coachman did not hesitate a moment; he whipped up the horses, and they
were off.

“one more second and i should have stopped him,” said keller,
afterwards. in fact, he and burdovsky jumped into another carriage and
set off in pursuit; but it struck them as they drove along that it was
not much use trying to bring nastasia back by force.

“besides,” said burdovsky, “the prince would not like it, would he?” so
they gave up the pursuit.

rogojin and nastasia philipovna reached the station just in time for the
train. as he jumped out of the carriage and was almost on the point
of entering the train, rogojin accosted a young girl standing on the
platform and wearing an

f from the abyss, he and all his saints.”

at last, about half-past ten, the prince was left alone. his head ached.
colia was the last to go, after having helped him to change his wedding
clothes. they parted on affectionate terms, and, without speaking of
what had happened, colia promised to come very early the next day. he
said later that the prince had given no hint of his intentions when they
said good-bye, but had hidden them even from him. soon there was hardly
anyone left in the house. burdovsky had gone to see hippolyte; keller
and lebedeff had wandered off together somewhere.

only vera lebedeff remained hurriedly rearranging the furniture in
the rooms. as she left the verandah, she glanced at the prince. he was
seated at the table, with both elbows upon it, and his head resting
on his hands. she approached him, and touched his shoulder gently.
the prince started and looked at her in perplexity; he seemed to be
collecting his senses for a minute or so, before he could remember where
