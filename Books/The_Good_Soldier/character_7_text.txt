was then, for the
only time of her career, that leonora really compromised herself--she
exclaimed.... "how frightful!... poor little maisie!..."

she caught herself up at that, but of course it was too late. it was a
queer sort of affair....

i want to do leonora every justice. i love her very dearly for one thing
and in this matter, which was certainly the ruin of my small household
cockle-shell, she certainly tripped up. i do not believe--and leonora
herself does not believe--that poor little maisie maidan was ever
edward's mistress. her heart was really so bad that she would have
succumbed to anything like an impassioned embrace. that is the plain
english of it, and i suppose plain english is best. she was really what
the other two, for reasons of their own, just pretended to be. queer,
isn't it? like one of those sinister jokes that providence plays upon
one. add to this that i do not suppose that leonora would much have
minded, at any other moment, if mrs maidan had been her husband's
mistress

a had known all about the passion, which had been quite a real
passion and had lasted for several years. you see, poor edward's
passions were quite logical in their progression upwards. they began
with a servant, went on to a courtesan and then to a quite nice woman,
very unsuitably mated. for she had a quite nasty husband who, by means
of letters and things, went on blackmailing poor edward to the tune of
three or four hundred a year--with threats of the divorce court. and
after this lady came maisie maidan, and after poor maisie only one more
affair and then--the real passion of his life. his marriage with leonora
had been arranged by his parents and, though he always admired her
immensely, he had hardly ever pretended to be much more than tender to
her, though he desperately needed her moral support, too....

but his really trying liabilities were mostly in the nature of
generosities proper to his station. he was, according to leonora, always
remitting his tenants' rents and giving the tenants t

llow that many men liked. he was so
presentable and quite ready to lend you his cigar puncher--that sort
of thing. so, every now and then some financier whom he met about would
give him a good, sound, profitable tip. and leonora was never afraid of
a bit of a gamble--english papists seldom are, i do not know why.

so nearly all her investment turned up trumps, and edward was really in
fit case to reopen branshaw manor and once more to assume his position
in the county. thus leonora had accepted maisie maidan almost with
resignation--almost with a sigh of relief. she really liked the poor
child--she had to like somebody. and, at any rate, she felt she could
trust maisie--she could trust her not to rook edward for several
thousands a week, for maisie had refused to accept so much as a trinket
ring from him. it is true that edward gurgled and raved about the girl
in a way that she had never yet experienced. but that, too, was almost a
relief. i think she would really have welcomed it if he could have

it too thick on poor old leonora to
be ballyragged any more. that was really the last of his outstanding
accounts, and he was ready to take his personal chance of the divorce
court if the blackmailer turned nasty. he would face it out--the
publicity, the papers, the whole bally show. those were his simple
words....

he had made, however, the mistake of not telling leonora where he was
going, so that, having seen him go to his room to fetch the code for
the telegram, and seeing, two hours later, maisie maidan come out of his
room, leonora imagined that the two hours she had spent in silent agony
edward had spent with maisie maidan in his arms. that seemed to her to
be too much. as a matter of fact, maisie's being in edward's room had
been the result, partly of poverty, partly of pride, partly of sheer
innocence. she could not, in the first place, afford a maid; she
refrained as much as possible from sending the hotel servants on
errands, since every penny was of importance to her, and she feared to

nights, with that vision of judgement before me, i know that i hold
myself back. for i hate florence. i hate florence with such a hatred
that i would not spare her an eternity of loneliness. she need not have

will find me an elevator to run.... but florence... .

she should not have done it. she should not have done it. it was playing
it too low down. she cut out poor dear edward from sheer vanity;
she meddled between him and leonora from a sheer, imbecile spirit of
district visiting. do you understand that, whilst she was edward's

ould answer something like:

"yes, you would give him up. and you would go on writing to each other
in secret, and committing adultery in hired rooms. i know the pair
of you, you know. no. i prefer the situation as it is." half the time
florence would ignore leonora's remarks. she would think they were not
quite ladylike. the other half of the time she would try to persuade
leonora that her love for edward was quite spiritual--on account of her
heart. once she said:

"if you can believe that of maisie maidan, as you say you do, why cannot
you believe it of me?" leonora was, i understand, doing her hair at
that time in front of the mirror in her bedroom. and she looked round
at florence, to whom she did not usually vouchsafe a glance,--she looked
round coolly and calmly, and said:

"never do you dare to mention mrs maidan's name again. you murdered her.
you and i murdered her between us. i am as much a scoundrel as you. i
don't like to be reminded of it."

i do not know where the public morality of the case comes in, and, of
course, no man really knows what he would have done in any given case.
but i truly believe that i would have united them, observing ways and
means as decent as i could. i believe that i should have given them
money to live upon and that i should have consoled myself somehow. at
that date i might have found some young thing, like maisie maidan, or
the poor girl, and i might have had some peace. for peace i never had
with florence, and hardly believe that i cared for her in the way of
love after a year or two of it. she became for me a rare and fragile
object, something burdensome, but very frail. why it was as if i
had been given a thin-shelled pullet's egg to carry on my palm from

her. leonora had given up even showing the
accounts of the ashburnham estate to edward. he thought that that was
because she had piled up such a lot of money that she did not want him
to know how she was getting on any more. but, as a matter of fact, after
five or six years it had penetrated to her mind that it was painful to
edward to have to look on at the accounts of his estate and have no hand
in the management of it. she was trying to do him a kindness. and, up in
chitral, poor dear little maisie maidan came along....

that was the most unsettling to edward of all his affairs. it made him
suspect that he was inconstant. the affair with the dolciquita he had
sized up as a short attack of madness like hydrophobia. his relations
with mrs basil had not seemed to him to imply moral turpitude of a
gross kind. the husband had been complaisant; they had really loved each
other; his wife was very cruel to him and had long ceased to be a wife
to him. he thought that mrs basil had been his soul-mate, sep

him by an unkind fate--something sentimental of that sort.

but he discovered that, whilst he was still writing long weekly letters
to mrs basil, he was beginning to be furiously impatient if he missed
seeing maisie maidan during the course of the day. he discovered himself
watching the doorways with impatience; he discovered that he disliked
her boy husband very much for hours at a time. he discovered that he
was getting up at unearthly hours in order to have time, later in the
morning, to go for a walk with maisie maidan. he discovered himself
using little slang words that she used and attaching a sentimental value
to those words. these, you understand, were discoveries that came so
late that he could do nothin

take mrs maidan with us to europe and drop her at
nauheim?"

he hadn't had the least idea of saying that to leonora. he had merely
been standing, looking at an illustrated paper, waiting for dinner.
dinner was twenty minutes late or the ashburnhams would not have been
alone together. no, he hadn't had the least idea of framing that speech.
he had just been standing in a silent agony of fear, of longing, of
heat, of fever. he was thinking that they were going back to branshaw in
a month and that maisie maidan was going to remain behind and die. and
then, that had come out.

the punkah swished in the darkened room; leonora lay exhausted and
motionless in her cane lounge; neither of them stirred. they were both
at that time very ill in indefinite ways.

and then leonora said:

"yes. i promised it to charlie maidan this afternoon. i have offered to
pay her ex's myself."

edward just saved himself from saying: "good god!" you see, he had not
the least idea of what leonora knew--about maisie, about mrs b

 leonora's great achievement. she laid the
figures before edward, who maintained an unbroken silence.

"i propose," she said, "that you should resign from the army and that
we should go back to branshaw. we are both too ill to stay here any
longer."

edward said nothing at all.

"this," leonora continued passionlessly, "is the great day of my life."

edward said:

"you have managed the job amazingly. you are a wonderful woman." he
was thinking that if they went back to branshaw they would leave
maisie maidan behind. that thought occupied him exclusively. they must,
undoubtedly, return to branshaw; there could be no doubt that leonora
was too ill to stay in that place. she said:

"you understand that the management of the whole of the expenditure of
the income will be in your hands. there will be five thousand a year."
she thought that he cared very much about the expenditure of an income
of five thousand a year and that the fact that she had done so much
for him would rouse in him some affection fo

r her. but he was thinking
exclusively of maisie maidan--of maisie, thousands of miles away from
him. he was seeing the mountains between them--blue mountains and the
sea and sunlit plains. he said:

"that is very generous of you." and she did not know whether that were
praise or a sneer. that had been a week before. and all that week he had
passed in an increasing agony at the thought that those mountains, that
sea, and those sunlit plains would be between him and maisie maidan.
that thought shook him in the burning nights: the sweat poured from him
and he trembled with cold, in the burning noons--at that thought. he
had no minute's rest; his bowels turned round and round within him: his
tongue was perpetually dry and it seemed to him that the breath between
his teeth was like air from a pest-house.

he gave no thought to leonora at all; he had sent in his papers. they
were to leave in a month. it seemed to him to be his duty to leave that
place and to go away, to sup

port leonora. he did his duty.

it was horrible, in their relationship at that time, that whatever she
did caused him to hate her. he hated her when he found that she proposed
to set him up as the lord of branshaw again--as a sort of dummy lord,
in swaddling clothes. he imagined that she had done this in order to
separate him from maisie maidan. hatred hung in all the heavy nights and
filled the shadowy corners of the room. so when he heard that she
had offered to the maidan boy to take his wife to europe with him,
automatically he hated her since he hated all that she did. it seemed to
him, at that time, that she could never be other than cruel even if, by
accident, an act of hers were kind.... yes, it was a horrible situation.

but the cool breezes of the ocean seemed to clear up that hatred as if
it had been a curtain. they seemed

to give him back admiration for her,
and respect. the agreeableness of having money lavishly at command,
the fact that it had bought for him the companionship of maisie
maidan--these things began to make him see that his wife might have been
right in the starving and scraping upon which she had insisted. he was
at ease; he was even radiantly happy when he carried cups of bouillon
for maisie maidan along the deck. one night, when he was leaning beside
leonora, over the ship's side, he said suddenly:

"by jove, you're the finest woman in the world. i wish we could be
better friends."

she just turned away without a word and went to her cabin. still, she
was very much better in health.

and now, i suppose, i must give you leonora's side of the case....

that is very difficult. for leonora, if she preserved an unchanged
front, changed very frequently her point of view. she had been
drilled--

er. her spiritual advisers, i believe,
forbade that. but she stipulated that he must, in some way, perhaps
symbolical, come back to her. she was not very clear as to what she
meant; probably she did not know herself. or perhaps she did.

there were moments when he seemed to be coming back to her; there were
moments when she was within a hair of yielding to her physical passion
for him. in just the same way, at moments, she almost yielded to the
temptation to denounce mrs basil to her husband or maisie maidan
to hers. she desired then to cause the horrors and pains of public
scandals. for, watching edward more intently and with more straining of
ears than that which a cat bestows upon a bird overhead, she was aware
of the progress of his passion for each of these ladies. she was aware
of it from the way in which his eyes returned to doors and gateways; she
knew from his tranquillities when he had received satisfactions.

at times she imagined herself to see more than was warranted. she
imagined that
 
 ___________________________
 
 edward was carrying on intrigues with other women--with
two at once; with three. for whole periods she imagined him to be a
monster of libertinage and she could not see that he could have anything
against her. she left him his liberty; she was starving herself to build
up his fortunes; she allowed herself none of the joys of femininity--no
dresses, no jewels--hardly even friendships, for fear they should cost
money.

and yet, oddly, she could not but be aware that both mrs basil and
maisie maidan were nice women. the curious, discounting eye which one
woman can turn on another did not prevent her seeing that mrs basil was
very good to edward and mrs maidan very good for him. that seemed her to
be a monstrous and incomprehensible working of fate's. incomprehensible!
why, she asked herself again and again, did none of the good deeds that
she did for her husband ever come through to him, or appear to him as
good deeds? by what trick of mania could not he let her be as good to
him as mrs ba

use she had a dread of scandals.
edward might get himself mixed up with a marriageable daughter of some
man who would make a row or some husband who would matter. but, really,
she acknowledged afterwards to herself, she was hoping that, mrs basil
being out of the way, the time might have come when edward should return
to her. all that period she passed in an agony of jealousy and fear--the
fear that edward might really become promiscuous in his habits.

so that, in an odd way, she was glad when maisie maidan came along--and
she realized that she had not, before, been afraid of husbands and
of scandals, since, then, she did her best to keep maisie's husband
unsuspicious. she wished to appear so trustful of edward that maidan
could not possibly have any suspicions. it was an evil position for
her. but edward was very ill and she wanted to see him smile again. she
thought that if he could smile again through her agency he might return,
through gratitude and satisfied love--to her. at that time she tho

that might have done the trick. but, even in her madness, she was
afraid to go as far as that. she was afraid that, if she did, edward and
florence would make a bolt of it, and that, if they did that, she would
lose forever all chance of getting him back in the end. she acted very
badly to me.

well, she was a tortured soul who put her church before the interests of
a philadelphia quaker. that is all right--i daresay the church of rome
is the more important of the two.

a week after maisie maidan's death she was aware that florence had
become edward's mistress. she waited outside florence's door and met
edward as he came away. she said nothing and he only grunted. but i
guess he had a bad time.

yes, the mental deterioration that florence worked in leonora was
extraordinary; it smashed up her whole life and all her chances. it
made her, in the first place, hopeless--for she could not see how, after
that, edward could return to her--after a vulgar intrigue with a vulgar
woman. his affair

to me. i am estranged from leonora, who married rodney bayham in my

she has got it into her head that i disapprove of her marriage with
rodney bayham. well, i disapprove of her marriage. possibly i am
jealous. yes, no doubt i am jealous. in my fainter sort of way i seem to
perceive myself following the lines of edward ashburnham. i suppose that
i should really like to be a polygamist; with nancy, and with leonora,
and with maisie maidan and possibly even with florence. i am no doubt
like every other man; only, probably because of my american origin i am
fainter. at the same time i am able to assure you that i am a strictly
respectable person. i have never done anything that the most anxious

and the moment that she heard that, leonora determined that the girl
should not go five thousand miles away and that she should not continue
to love edward. the way she worked it was this:

she continued to tell the girl that she must belong to edward; she was
going to get a divorce; she was going to get a dissolution of marriage
from rome. but she considered it to be her duty to warn the girl of the
sort of monster that edward was. she told the girl of la dolciquita, of
mrs basil, of maisie maidan, of florence. she spoke of the agonies
that she had endured during her life with the man, who was violent,
overbearing, vain, drunken, arrogant, and monstrously a prey to his
sexual necessities. and, at hearing of the miseries her aunt had
suffered--for leonora once more had the aspect of an aunt to the
girl--with the swift cruelty of youth and, with the swift solidarity
that attaches woman to woman, the girl made her resolves. her aunt said
incessantly: "you must save edward's life; you must s

hat he wanted--that
the girl should go five thousand miles away and love him steadfastly
as people do in sentimental novels, she was determined to smash that
aspiration. and she repeated to edward in every possible tone that the
girl did not love him; that the girl detested him for his brutality, his
overbearingness, his drinking habits. she pointed out that edward in the
girl's eyes, was already pledged three or four deep. he was pledged to
leonora herself, to mrs basil, and to the memories of maisie maidan and
to florence. edward never said anything.

did the girl love edward, or didn't she? i don't know. at that time i
daresay she didn't though she certainly had done so before leonora had
got to work upon his reputation. she certainly had loved him for what
i call the public side of his record--for his good soldiering, for his
saving lives at sea, for the excellent landlord that he was and the good
sportsman. but it is quite possible that all those things came to
appear as nothing in her eyes wh
