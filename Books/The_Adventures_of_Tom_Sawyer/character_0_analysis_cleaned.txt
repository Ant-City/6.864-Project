[CHARACTER]
when the novel begins, tom is a mischievous child who
envies huck finn's lazy lifestyle and freedom. as tom's adventures
proceed, however, critical moments show tom moving away from his
childhood concerns and making mature, responsible decisions. these moments
include tom's testimony at muff potter's trial, his saving of becky
from punishment, and his heroic navigation out of the cave. by the
end of the novel, tom is coaxing huck into staying at the widow
douglas's, urging his friend to accept tight collars, sunday school,
and good table manners. he is no longer a disobedient character
undermining the adult order, but a defender of respectability and
responsibility. in the end, growing up for tom means embracing social
custom and sacrificing the freedoms of childhood.

yet tom's development isn't totally coherent. the novel
jumps back and forth among several narrative strands: tom's general
misbehavior, which climaxes in the jackson's island adventure; his courtship
of becky, which culminates in his acceptance of blame for the book
that she rips; and his struggle with injun joe, which ends with
tom and huck's discovery of the treasure. because of the picaresque,
or episodic, nature of the plot, tom's character can seem inconsistent,
as it varies depending upon his situation. tom is a paradoxical
figure in some respects--for example, he has no determinate age.
sometimes tom shows the naivete of a smaller child, with his interest
in make-believe and superstitions. on the other hand, tom's romantic
interest in becky and his fascination with huck's smoking and drinking
seem more the concerns of an adolescent.
whether or not a single course of development characterizes tom's
adventures, a single character trait--tom's unflagging energy and
thirst for adventure--propels the novel from episode to episode.
disobedient though he may be, tom ends up as st. petersburg's hero.
as the town gossips say, "[tom] would be president, yet, if he escaped
hanging."
