                        prologue

    in troy, there lies the scene. from isles of greece
    the princes orgillous, their high blood chaf'd,
    have to the port of athens sent their ships
    fraught with the ministers and instruments
    of cruel war. sixty and nine that wore
    their crownets regal from th' athenian bay
    put forth toward phrygia; and their vow is made
    to ransack troy, within whose strong immures
    the ravish'd helen, menelaus' queen,
    with wanton paris sleeps-and that's the quarrel.
    to tenedos they come,
    and the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge
    their war-like fraughtage. now on dardan plains
    the fresh and yet unbruised greeks do pitch
    their brave pavilions: priam's six-gated city,
    dardan, and tymbria, helias, chetas, troien,
    and antenorides, with massy staples
    and corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,
    sperr up the sons of troy.
    now expectation, tickling skittish spirits
    on one and other

ever i saw her
    look, or any woman else.
  troilus. i was about to tell thee: when my heart,
    as wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,
    lest hector or my father should perceive me,
    i have, as when the sun doth light a storm,
    buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile.
    but sorrow that is couch'd in seeming gladness
    is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.
  pandarus. an her hair were not somewhat darker than helen's-well,
    go to- there were no more comparison between the women. but, for
    my part, she is my kinswoman; i would not, as they term it,
    praise her, but i would somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as
    i did. i  will not dispraise your sister cassandra's wit; but-
  troilus. o pandarus! i tell thee, pandarus-
    when i do tell thee there my hopes lie drown'd,
    reply not in how many fathoms deep
    they lie indrench'd. i tell thee i am mad
    in cressid's love. thou answer'st 'she is fair'-
    pourest in the open

 ulcer of my heart-
    her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,
    handlest in thy discourse. o, that her hand,
    in whose comparison all whites are ink
    writing their own reproach; to whose soft seizure
    the cygnet's down is harsh, and spirit of sense
    hard as the palm of ploughman! this thou tell'st me,
    as true thou tell'st me, when i say i love her;
    but, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,
    thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
    the knife that made it.
  pandarus. i speak no more than truth.
  troilus. thou dost not speak so much.
  pandarus. faith, i'll not meddle in it. le

ctor was stirring early.
  cressida. that were we talking of, and of his anger.
  pandarus. was he angry?
  cressida. so he says here.
  pandarus. true, he was so; i know the cause too; he'll lay about
    him today, i can tell them that. and there's troilus will not
    come far behind him; let them take heed of troilus, i can tell
    them that too.
  cressida. what, is he angry too?
  pandarus. who, troilus? troilus is the better man of the two.
  cressida. o jupiter! there's no comparison.
  pandarus. what, not between troilus and hector? do you know a man
    if you see him?
  cressida. ay, if i ever saw him before and knew him.
  pandarus. well, i say troilus is troilus.
  cressida. then you say as i say, for i am sure he is not hector.
  pandarus. no, nor hector is not troilus in some degrees.
  cressida. 'tis just to each of them: he is himself.
  pandarus. himself! alas, poor troilus! i would he were!
  cressida. so he is.

  pandarus. nor his qualities.
  cressida. no matter.
  pandarus. nor his beauty.
  cressida. 'twould not become him: his own's better.
  pandarus. you have no judgment, niece. helen herself swore th'
    other day that troilus, for a brown favour, for so 'tis, i must
    confess- not brown neither-
  cressida. no, but brown.
  pandarus. faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.
  cressida. to say the truth, true and not true.
  pandarus. she prais'd his complexion above paris.
  cressida. why, paris hath colour enough.
  pandarus. so he has.
  cressida. then troilus should have too much. if she prais'd him
    above, his complexion is higher than his; he having colour
    enough, and the other higher, is too flaming praise for a good
    complexion. i had as lief helen's golden tongue had commended
    troilus for a copper nose.
  pandarus. i swear to you i think helen loves him better than paris.
  cressida. then she's a merry greek indeed.
  pandarus. na

i should have laugh'd too.
  pandarus. they laugh'd not so much at the hair as at his pretty
    answer.
  cressida. what was his answer?
  pandarus. quoth she 'here's but two and fifty hairs on your chin,
    and one of them is white.'
  cressida. this is her question.
  pandarus. that's true; make no question of that. 'two and fifty
    hairs,' quoth he 'and one white. that white hair is my father,
    and all the rest are his sons.' 'jupiter!' quoth she 'which of
    these hairs is paris my husband?' 'the forked one,' quoth he,
    'pluck't out and give it him.' but there was such laughing! and
    helen so blush'd, and paris so chaf'd; and all the rest so
    laugh'd that it pass'd.
  cressida. so let it now; for it has been a great while going by.
  pandarus. well, cousin, i told you a thing yesterday; think on't.
  cressida. so i do.
  pandarus. i'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, and 'twere a
    man born in april.
  cressida. and i'll spring up in his tears

ere's a countenance! is't not a
    brave man?
  cressida. o, a brave man!
  pandarus. is 'a not? it does a man's heart good. look you what
    hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, do you see? look you
    there. there's no jesting; there's laying on; take't off who
    will, as they say. there be hacks.
  cressida. be those with swords?
  pandarus. swords! anything, he cares not; an the devil come to him,
    it's all one. by god's lid, it does one's heart good. yonder
    comes paris, yonder comes paris.

                       paris passes

    look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too, is't not? why,
    this is brave now. who said he came hurt home to-day? he's not
    hurt. why, this will do helen's heart good now, ha! would i could
    see troilus now! you shall see troilus anon.

                      helenus passes

  cressida. who's that?
  pandarus. that's helenus. i marvel where troilus is. that's
    helenus. i think he went not forth to-day.

ere's a
    man, niece. hem! brave troilus, the prince of chivalry!
  cressida. peace, for shame, peace!
  pandarus. mark him; note him. o brave troilus! look well upon him,
    niece; look you how his sword is bloodied, and his helm more
    hack'd than hector's; and how he looks, and how he goes! o
    admirable youth! he never saw three and twenty. go thy way,
    troilus, go thy way. had i a sister were a grace or a daughter a
    goddess, he should take his choice. o admirable man! paris? paris
    is dirt to him; and, i warrant, helen, to change, would give an
    eye to boot.
  cressida. here comes more.

  pandarus. asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!
    porridge after meat! i could live and die in the eyes of troilus.
    ne'er look, ne'er look; the eagles are gone. crows and daws,
    crows and daws! i had rather be such a man as troilus than

    ajax is grown self-will'd and bears his head
    in such a rein, in full as proud a place

    makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war
    bold as an oracle, and sets thersites,
    a slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
    to match us in comparisons with dirt,
    to weaken and discredit our exposure,
    how rank soever rounded in with danger.
  ulysses. they tax our policy and call it cowardice,
    count wisdom as no member of the war,
    forestall prescience, and esteem no act
    but that of hand. the still and mental parts
    that do contrive how many hands shall strike

    as honour, loss of time, travail, expense,
    wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consum'd
    in hot digestion of this cormorant war-
    shall be struck off.' hector, what say you to't?

    your breath with full consent benied his sails;
    the seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce,
    and did him service. he touch'd the ports desir'd;
    and for an old aunt whom the greeks held captive
    he brought a grecian queen, whose youth and freshness
    wrinkles apollo's, and makes stale the morning.

    unlike young men, whom aristode thought
    unfit to hear moral philosophy.
    the reasons you allege do more conduce
    to the hot passion of distemp'red blood
    than to make up a free determination
    'twixt right and wrong; for pleasure and revenge
