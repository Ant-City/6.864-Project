once more, and, getting no answer to this, she quietly walked away:
but she couldn’t help saying to herself as she went, ‘of all the
unsatisfactory--’ (she repeated this aloud, as it was a great comfort to
have such a long word to say) ‘of all the unsatisfactory people i ever
met--’ she never finished the sentence, for at this moment a heavy crash
shook the forest from end to end.




chapter vii. the lion and the unicorn

the next moment soldiers came running through the wood, at first in twos
and threes, then ten or twenty together, and at last in such crowds that
they seemed to fill the whole forest. alice got behind a tree, for fear
of being run over, and watched them go by.

she thought that in all her life she had never seen soldiers so
uncertain on their feet: they were always tripping over something or
other, and whenever one went down, several more always fell over him, so
that the ground was soon cover

sorry for this, as she wanted to hear the news too.
however, instead of whispering, he simply shouted at the top of his
voice ‘they’re at it again!’

‘do you call that a whisper?’ cried the poor king, jumping up and
shaking himself. ‘if you do such a thing again, i’ll have you buttered!
it went through and through my head like an earthquake!’

‘it would have to be a very tiny earthquake!’ thought alice. ‘who are at
it again?’ she ventured to ask.

‘why the lion and the unicorn, of course,’ said the king.

‘fighting for the crown?’

‘yes, to be sure,’ said the king: ‘and the best of the joke is, that
it’s my crown all the while! let’s run and see them.’ and they trotted
off, alice repeating to herself, as she ran, the words of the old
song:--


   ‘the lion and the unicorn were fighting for the crown:
   the lion beat the unicorn all round the town.
   some gave them white bread, some gave them brown;
   some gave them plum-cake and drummed them ou

!’ said the king. ‘what an idea!’

‘would you--be good enough,’ alice panted out, after running a little
further, ‘to stop a minute--just to get--one’s breath again?’

‘i’m good enough,’ the king said, ‘only i’m not strong enough. you see,
a minute goes by so fearfully quick. you might as well try to stop a
bandersnatch!’

alice had no more breath for talking, so they trotted on in silence,
till they came in sight of a great crowd, in the middle of which the
lion and unicorn were fighting. they were in such a cloud of dust, that
at first alice could not make out which was which: but she soon managed
to distinguish the unicorn by his horn.

they placed themselves close to where hatta, the other messenger, was
standing watching the fight, with a cup of tea in one hand and a piece
of bread-and-butter in the other.

‘he’s only just out of prison, and he hadn’t finished his tea when
he was sent in,’ haigha whispered to alice: ‘and they only give them
oyster-sh

re they getting on with the
fight?’

hatta made a desperate effort, and swallowed a large piece of
bread-and-butter. ‘they’re getting on very well,’ he said in a choking
voice: ‘each of them has been down about eighty-seven times.’

‘then i suppose they’ll soon bring the white bread and the brown?’ alice
ventured to remark.

‘it’s waiting for ‘em now,’ said hatta: ‘this is a bit of it as i’m
eating.’

there was a pause in the fight just then, and the lion and the unicorn
sat down, panting, while the king called out ‘ten minutes allowed for
refreshments!’ haigha and hatta set to work at once, carrying rough
trays of white and brown bread. alice took a piece to taste, but it was
very dry.

‘i don’t think they’ll fight any more to-day,’ the king said to hatta:
‘go and order the drums to begin.’ and hatta went bounding away like a
grasshopper.

for a minute or two alice stood silent, watching him. suddenly she
brightened up. ‘look, look!’ she cr

 round. ‘that wood’s full of them.’

‘but aren’t you going to run and help her?’ alice asked, very much
surprised at his taking it so quietly.

‘no use, no use!’ said the king. ‘she runs so fearfully quick. you might
as well try to catch a bandersnatch! but i’ll make a memorandum about
her, if you like--she’s a dear good creature,’ he repeated softly to
himself, as he opened his memorandum-book. ‘do you spell “creature” with
a double “e”?’

at this moment the unicorn sauntered by them, with his hands in his
pockets. ‘i had the best of it this time?’ he said to the king, just
glancing at him as he passed.

‘a little--a little,’ the king replied, rather nervously. ‘you shouldn’t
have run him through with your horn, you know.’

‘it didn’t hurt him,’ the unicorn said carelessly, and he was going
on, when his eye happened to fall upon alice: he turned round rather
instantly, and stood for some time looking at her with an air of the

sgust.

‘what--is--this?’ he said at last.

‘this is a child!’ haigha replied eagerly, coming in front of alice
to introduce her, and spreading out both his hands towards her in an
anglo-saxon attitude. ‘we only found it to-day. it’s as large as life,
and twice as natural!’

‘i always thought they were fabulous monsters!’ said the unicorn. ‘is it
alive?’

‘it can talk,’ said haigha, solemnly.

the unicorn looked dreamily at alice, and said ‘talk, child.’

alice could not help her lips curling up into a smile as she began: ‘do
you know, i always thought unicorns were fabulous monsters, too! i never
saw one alive before!’

‘well, now that we have seen each other,’ said the unicorn, ‘if you’ll
believe in me, i’ll believe in you. is that a bargain?’

‘yes, if you like,’ said alice.

‘come, fetch out the plum-cake, old man!’ the unicorn went on, turning
from her to the kin

haigha took a large cake out of the bag, and gave it to alice to hold,
while he got out a dish and carving-knife. how they all came out of it
alice couldn’t guess. it was just like a conjuring-trick, she thought.

the lion had joined them while this was going on: he looked very
tired and sleepy, and his eyes were half shut. ‘what’s this!’ he said,
blinking lazily at alice, and speaking in a deep hollow tone that
sounded like the tolling of a great bell.

‘ah, what is it, now?’ the unicorn cried eagerly. ‘you’ll never guess!
_i_ couldn’t.’

the lion looked at alice wearily. ‘are you animal--vegetable--or
mineral?’ he said, yawning at every other word.

‘it’s a fabulous monster!’ the unicorn cried out, before alice could
reply.

‘then hand round the plum-cake, monster,’ the lion said, lying down and
putting his chin on his paws. ‘and sit down, both of you,’ (to the king
and the unicorn): ‘fair play with the cake, you know!’

the king was evidently ver

y uncomfortable at having to sit down between
the two great creatures; but there was no other place for him.

‘what a fight we might have for the crown, now!’ the unicorn said,
looking slyly up at the crown, which the poor king was nearly shaking
off his head, he trembled so much.

‘i should win easy,’ said the lion.

‘i’m not so sure of that,’ said the unicorn.

‘why, i beat you all round the town, you chicken!’ the lion replied
angrily, half getting up as he spoke.

here the king interrupted, to prevent the quarrel going on: he was very
nervous, and his voice quite quivered. ‘all round the town?’ he
said. ‘that’s a good long way. did you go by the old bridge, or the
market-place? you get the best view by the old bridge.’

‘i’m sure i don’t know,’ the lion growled out as he lay down again.
‘there was too much dust to see anyth

ing. what a time the monster is,
cutting up that cake!’

alice had seated herself on the bank of a little brook, with the great
dish on her knees, and was sawing away diligently with the knife. ‘it’s
very provoking!’ she said, in reply to the lion (she was getting quite
used to being called ‘the monster’). ‘i’ve cut several slices already,
but they always join on again!’

‘you don’t know how to manage looking-glass cakes,’ the unicorn
remarked. ‘hand it round first, and cut it afterwards.’

this sounded nonsense, but alice very obediently got up, and carried the
dish round, and the cake divided itself into three pieces as she did so.
‘now cut it up,’ said the lion, as she returned to her place with the
empty dish.

‘i say, this isn’t fair!’ cried the unicorn, as alice sat with the knife
in her hand, very much puzzled how to begin. ‘the monster has given the
lion twice as much as me!’

‘she’s kept none f

or herself, anyhow,’ said the lion. ‘do you like
plum-cake, monster?’

but before alice could answer him, the drums began.

where the noise came from, she couldn’t make out: the air seemed full
of it, and it rang through and through her head till she felt quite
deafened. she started to her feet and sprang across the little brook in
her terror,

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

and had just time to see the lion and the unicorn rise to their feet,
with angry looks at being interrupted in their feast, before she dropped
to her knees, and put her hands over her ears, vainly trying to shut out
the dreadful uproar.

‘if that doesn’t “drum them out of town,”’ she thought to herself,
‘nothing ever will!’




chapter viii. ‘it’s my own invention’

after a while the noise seemed gradually to die away, till all was dead
silence, and alice lifted up her head in some alarm. there was no one
to be seen, and he

r first thought was that she must have been dreaming
about the lion and the unicorn and those queer anglo-saxon messengers.
however, there was the great dish still lying at her feet, on which she
had tried to cut the plum-cake, ‘so i wasn’t dreaming, after all,’ she
said to herself, ‘unless--unless we’re all part of the same dream. only
i do hope it’s my dream, and not the red king’s! i don’t like belonging
to another person’s dream,’ she went on in a rather complaining tone:
‘i’ve a great mind to go and wake him, and see what happens!’
