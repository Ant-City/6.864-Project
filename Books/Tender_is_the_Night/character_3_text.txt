was that something tactful should be said by somebody, but
dick made no attempt to break up the grouping formed by
these late arrivals, not even to disarm mrs. mckisco of her
air of supercilious amusement. he did not solve this social
problem because he knew it was not of importance at the
moment and would solve itself. he was saving his newness
for a larger effort, waiting a more significant moment for his
guests to be conscious of a good time.
rosemary stood beside tommy barbanâ€”he was in a
particularly scornful mood and there seemed to be some
special stimulus working upon him. he was leaving in the
morning.

in a pause rosemary looked away and up the table where
nicole sat between tommy barban and abe north, her
chowâ€™s hair foaming and frothing in the candlelight. rosemary
listened, caught sharply by the rich clipped voice in
infrequent speech:
â€˜the poor man,â€™ nicole exclaimed. â€˜why did you want to

â€˜naturally i wanted to see what was inside a waiter.

of broken china and tips and pencil stubs.â€™

â€˜i was talking to her about a plan i haveâ€”she told me

â€˜so since things are over down hereâ€”â€˜

â€˜well, this is overâ€”this part of the summer is over. last

â€˜you have romantic eyes.â€™
his laughter swept them on up toward the terrace where
he delivered her to nicole... .
too soon it had become time to go and the divers helped
them all to go quickly. in the diversâ€™ big isotta there would
be tommy barban and his baggageâ€”he was spending the
night at the hotel to catch an early trainâ€”with mrs. abrams,
the mckiscos and campion. earl brady was going to drop
rosemary and her mother on his way to monte carlo, and

he went to the mail desk firstâ€”as the woman who served
him pushed up with her bosom a piece of paper that had
nearly escaped the desk, he thought how differently women
use their bodies from men. he took his letters aside to open:
there was a bill for seventeen psychiatric books from a german
concern, a bill from brentanoâ€™s, a letter from buffalo
from his father, in a handwriting that year by year became
more indecipherable; there was a card from tommy barban
postmarked fez and bearing a facetious communication;
there were letters from doctors in zurich, both in german;
a disputed bill from a plasterer in cannes; a bill from
a furniture maker; a letter from the publisher of a medical
journal in baltimore, miscellaneous announcements and
an invitation to a showing of pictures by an incipient artist;
also there were three letters for nicole, and a letter for rosemary
sent in his care.

tommy barban was a ruler, tommy was a heroâ€”dick happened
upon him in the marienplatz in munich, in one of
those cafÃ©s, where small gamblers diced on â€˜tapestryâ€™ mats.
the air was full of politics, and the slap of cards.
tommy was at a table laughing his martial laugh: â€˜umbuhâ€”ha-ha!
um-buhâ€”ha-ha!â€™ as a rule, he drank little;
courage was his game and his companions were always a
little afraid of him. recently an eighth of the area of his
skull had been removed by a warsaw surgeon and was knittin

upon his duel with tommy barban, upon the basis of which,
as it withered in his memory, he had created, afresh, a new
self-respect.
spotting dick diver the second day out, he eyed him
tentatively, then introduced himself in a friendly way and
sat down. dick laid aside his reading and, after the few
minutes that it took to realize the change in mckisco, the
disappearance of the manâ€™s annoying sense of inferiority,
found himself pleased to talk to him. mckisco was â€˜wellinformedâ€™

independent existence, whether it was the mad gallantry
of the wretch who had died in the clinic this morning, or
the courageous grace which this lost young man brought
to a drab old story. dick tried to dissect it into pieces small
enough to store awayâ€”realizing that the totality of a life may
be different in quality from its segments, and also that life
during the forties seemed capable of being observed only in
segments. his love for nicole and rosemary, his friendship
with abe north, with tommy barban in the broken universe
of the warâ€™s endingâ€”in such contacts the personalities
had seemed to press up so close to him that he became the
personality itselfâ€”there seemed some necessity of taking
all or nothing; it was as if for the remainder of his life he
was condemned to carry with him the egos of certain people,

threat of his powerful body. turning the corner of the door
nicole saw that dick was still sitting at the table. she was furious
at the woman for her preposterous statement, equally
furious at dick for having brought them here, for having
become fuddled, for having untipped the capped barbs of
his irony, for having come off humiliatedâ€”she was a little
more annoyed because she knew that her taking posses-

a moment later she saw dick standing in the gangway,
apparently in complete control of himself as he talked with

about the deck and she broke out of an intricate malay game,
played with string and coffee beans, and said to tommy:

vaguely that dick had planned for her to have it, she lay on

in nice a short provocative letter.
but that was for the daytimeâ€”toward evening with the
inevitable diminution of nervous energy, her spirits flagged,
and the arrows flew a little in the twilight. she was afraid of
what was in dickâ€™s mind; again she felt that a plan underlay
his current actions and she was afraid of his plansâ€”they
worked well and they had an all-inclusive logic about them
which nicole was not able to command. she had somehow
given over the thinking to him, and in his abse

later they sat with the children on the moorish roof and
watched the fireworks of two casinos, far apart, far down
on the shore. it was lonely and sad to be so empty-hearted
toward each other.
next morning, back from shopping in cannes, nicole
found a note saying that dick had taken the small car and
gone up into provence for a few days by himself. even as she
read it the phone rangâ€”it was tommy barban from monte
carlo, saying that he had received her letter and was driving
over. she felt her lipsâ€™ warmth in the receiver as she welcomed
his coming.

dick and nicole were accustomed to go together to the
barber, and have haircuts and shampoos in adjoining rooms.
from dickâ€™s side nicole could hear the snip of shears, the
count of changes, the voilÃ s and pardons. the day after his
return they went down to be shorn and washed in the perfumed
breeze of the fans.
in front of the carleton hotel, its windows as stubbornly
blank to the summer as so many cellar doors, a car passed
them and tommy barban was in it. nicoleâ€™s momentary
glimpse of his expression, taciturn and thoughtful and, in
the second of seeing her, wide-eyed and alert, disturbed her.
she wanted to be going where he was going. the hour with
the hair-dresser seemed one of the wasteful intervals that
composed her life, another little prison. the coiffeuse in her
white uniform, faintly sweating lip-rouge and cologne reminded
her of many nurses.
in the next room dick dozed under an apron and a lather
of soap. the mirror in front
