 and 
were visited by people of importance and by young folk. in their views as to their 
acquaintances, husband, wife and daughter were entirely agreed, and tacitly and 
unanimously kept at arm's length and shook off the various shabby friends and 
relations who, with much show of affection, gushed into the drawing-room with its 
japanese plates on the walls. soon these shabby friends ceased to obtrude 
themselves and only the best people remained in the golovins' set.  
 
young men made up to lisa, and petrishchev, an examining magistrate and 
dmitri ivanovich petrishchev's son and sole heir, began to be so attentive to her 
that ivan ilyich had already spoken to praskovya fedorovna about it, and 
considered whether they should not arrange a party for them, or get up some 
private theatricals.  
 
so they lived, and all went well, without change, and life flowed pleasantly.

they were all in good health. it could not be called ill health if ivan ilyich

he really wanted to say: that she would not on any account 
have gone but that the box had been taken and helen and their daughter were 
going, as well as petrishchev (the examining magistrate, their daughter's fiancé) 
and that it was out of the question to let them go alone; but that she would have 
much preferred to sit with him for a while; and he must be sure to follow the 
doctor's orders while she was away.  
 
"oh, and fedor petrovich" (the fiancé) "would like to come in. may he? and 
lisa?"  

 
"all right."  
 
their daughter came in in full evening dress, her fresh young flesh exposed 
(making a show of that very flesh which in his own case caused so much 
suffering), strong, healthy, evidently in love, and impatient with illness, suffering, 
and death, because they interfered with her happiness.  
 
fedor petrovich came in too, in evening dress, his hair curled a la capoul, a tight 
stiff collar round his long sinewy neck, an enormous white shirt-front and narrow

 in his hand.  
 
following him the schoolboy crept in unnoticed, in a new uniform, poor little 
fellow, and wearing gloves. terribly dark shadows showed under his eyes, the 
meaning of which ivan ilyich knew well.  
 
his son had always seemed pathetic to him, and now it was dreadful to see the 
boy's frightened look of pity. it seemed to ivan ilyich that vasya was the only one 
besides gerasim who understood and pitied him.  
 
they all sat down and again asked how he was. a silence followed. lisa asked 
her mother about the opera glasses, and there was an altercation between 
mother and daughter as to who had taken them and where they had been put. 
this occasioned some unpleasantness.  
 
fedor petrovich inquired of ivan ilyich whether he had ever seen sarah 
bernhardt. ivan ilyich did not at first catch the question, but then replied: "no, 
have you seen her before?"  
 
"yes, in adrienne lecouvreur." 
 
praskovya fedorovna mentioned some roles in which sarah bernhardt was

in the midst of the conversation fedor petrovich glanced at ivan ilyich and 
became silent. the others also looked at him and grew silent. ivan ilyich was 
staring with glittering eyes straight before him, evidently indignant with them. this 
had to be rectified, but it was impossible to do so. the silence had to be broken, 
but for a time no one dared to break it and they all became afraid that the 
conventional deception would suddenly become obvious and the truth become 
plain to all. lisa was the first to pluck up courage and break that silence, but by 
trying to hide what everybody was feeling, she betrayed it.  
 

"well, if we are going it's time to start," she said, looking at her watch, a present 
from her father, and with a faint and significant smile at fedor petrovich relating 
to something known only to them. she got up with a rustle of her dress.  
 
they all rose, said goodnight, and went away.  
 
when they had gone it seemed to ivan ilyich that he felt better; the

"for christ's sake let me die in peace!" he said.  

 
she would have gone away, but just then their daughter came in and went up to 
say good morning. he looked at her as he had done at his wife, and in reply to 
her inquiry about his health said dryly that he would soon free them all of himself. 
they were both silent and after sitting with him for a while went away.  
 
"is it our fault?" lisa said to her mother. "it's as if we were to blame! i am sorry for 
papa, but why should we be tortured?"  
 
the doctor came at his usual time. ivan ilyich answered "yes" and "no," never 
taking his angry eyes from him, and at last said: "you know you can do nothing 
for me, so leave me alone."  
 
"we can ease your sufferings."  
 
"you can't even do that. let me be."  
 
the doctor went into the drawing room and told praskovya fedorovna that the 
case was very serious and that the only resourc
