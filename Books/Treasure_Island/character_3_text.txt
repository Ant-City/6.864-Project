the old sea-dog at the admiral benbow


squire trelawney, dr. livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having
asked me to write down the whole particulars about treasure island, from
the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the
island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, i
take up my pen in the year of grace 17__ and go back to the time when
my father kept the admiral benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the

whiskers curled in ringlets, and tarry pigtails, and their swaggering,
clumsy sea-walk; and if i had seen as many kings or archbishops i could
not have been more delighted.

and i was going to sea myself, to sea in a schooner, with a piping

wonderful dexterity, hopping about upon it like a bird. he was very tall
and strong, with a face as big as a ham--plain and pale, but intelligent
and smiling. indeed, he seemed in the most cheerful spirits, whistling
as he moved about among the tables, with a merry word or a slap on the
shoulder for the more favoured of his guests.

now, to tell you the truth, from the very first mention of long john in
squire trelawney's letter i had taken a fear in my mind that he might
prove to be the very one-legged sailor whom i had watched for so long at
the old benbow. but one look at the man before me was enough. i had seen
the captain, and black dog, and the blind man, pew, and i thought i knew
what a buccaneer was like--a very different creature, according to me,
from this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord.

i plucked up courage at once, crossed the threshold, and walked right up
to the man where he stood, propped
