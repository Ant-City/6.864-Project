of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as
good as dead and gone.

when the attorney-general ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if
a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in
anticipation of what he was soon to become. when toned down again, the
unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box.

mr. solicitor-general then, following his leader’s lead, examined the
patriot: john barsad, gentleman, by name. the story of his pure soul was
exactly what mr. attorney-general had described it to be--perhaps, if
it had a fault, a little too exactly. having released his noble bosom
of its burden, he would have modestly withdrawn himself, but that the

into the red coals at the royal george at dover, now a good many years
ago. he turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with
