'percival has gone now,' said neville. 'he is thinking of nothing but the match. he never waved his hand as the brake turned the corner by the laurel bush. he despises me for being too weak to play (yet he is always kind to my weakness). he despises me for not caring if they win or lose except that he cares. he takes my devotion; he accepts my tremulous, no doubt abject offering, mixed with contempt as it is for his mind. for he cannot read. yet when i read shakespeare or catullus, lying in the long gras

the train slows and lengthens, as we approach london, the centre, and my heart draws out too, in fear, in exultation. i am about to meet--what? what extraordinary adventure waits me, among these mail vans, these porters, these swarms of people calling taxis? i feel insignificant, lost, but exultant. with a soft s

'there is susan,' said louis. 'she does not see us. she has not dressed, because she despises the futility of london. she stands for a moment at the swing-door, looking about her like a creature dazed by the light of a lamp. now she moves. she has the stealthy yet assured movements (even among tables and chairs) of a wild beast. she seems to find her way by instinct in and out among these littl

'no, that is too small, too particular a name. we cannot attach the width and spread of our feelings to so small a mark. we have come together (from the north, from the south, from susan's farm, from louis' house of business) to make one thing, not enduring--for what endures?--but seen by many eyes simultaneously. there is a red carnation in that vase. a single flower as we sat here waiting, but now a seven-sided flower, many-petalled, red, puce, purple-sha

'the roar of london,' said louis, 'is round us. motor-cars, vans, omnibuses pass and repass continuously. all are merged in one turning wheel of single sound. all separate sounds--wheels, bells, the cries of drunkards, of merrymakers--are churned into one sound, steel blue, circular. then a siren hoots. at that shores slip away, chimneys flatten themselves, the ship makes for the open sea.'

'percival is going,' said neville. 'we sit here, surrounded, lit up, many coloured; all things--hands, curtains, knives and forks, other people dining--run into each other. we are walled in here. but india lies outside.'

'i see india,' said bernard. 'i see the low, long shore; i see the tortuous lanes of stamped mud that lead in and out among ramshackle pagodas; i see the gilt and crenellated buildings which have an air of fragility and decay as if they were temporarily run up buildings in some oriental

'it is percival,' said louis, 'sitting silent as he sat among the tickling grasses when the breeze parted the clouds and they formed again, who makes us aware that these attempts to say, "i am this, i am that," which we make, coming together, like separated parts of one body and soul, are false. something has been left out from fear.

'"like" and "like" and "like"--but what is the thing that lies beneath the semblance of the thing? now that lightning has gashed the tree and the flowering branch has fallen and percival, by his death, has made me this gift, let me see the thing. there is a square; there is an oblong. the players take the square and place it upon the oblong. they place it very accurately; they make a perfect dwelling-place. very little is left outside. the structure is now visible; what is inchoate is here stated; we are not so various or so mean; we have made oblongs and stood them upon squares. this is our triumph; this is our consolation.

('yet, louis,' said rhoda, 'how short a time silence lasts. already they are beginning to smooth their napkins by the side of their plates. "who comes?" says jinny; and neville sighs, remembering that percival comes no more. jinny has taken out her looking-glass. surveying her face like an artist, she draws a powder-puff down her nose, and after one moment of deliberation has given precisely that red to the lips that the lips need. susan, who feels scorn and fear at the sight of these preparations, fastens the top button of her coat, and unfastens it. what is she making ready for? for something, but something different.'

e? there was the doctor lurching into chapel, as if he trod a battleship in a gale of wind, shouting out his commands through a megaphone, since people in authority always become melodramatic--i did not hate him like neville, or revere him like louis. i took notes as we sat together in chapel. there were pillars, shadows, memorial brasses, boys scuffling and swopping stamps behind prayer books; the sound of a rusty pump; the doctor booming, about immortality and quitting ourselves like men; and percival scratching his thigh. i made notes for stories; drew portraits in the margin of my pocket-book and thus became still more separate. here are one or two of the figures i saw.

'percival sat staring straight ahead of him that day in chapel. he also had a way of flicking his hand to the back of his neck. his movements were always remarkable. we all flicked our hands to the backs of our heads--unsuccessfully. he had the kind of beauty which defends itself from any caress. as he was not in the least

'the willow tree grew by the river. i sat on the smooth turf with neville, with larpent, with baker, romsey, hughes, percival and jinny. through its fine plumes specked with little pricked ears of green in spring, of orange in autumn, i saw boats; buildings; i saw hurrying, decrepit women. i buried match after match in the turf decidedly to mark this or that stage in the process of understanding (it might be philosophy; science; it might be myself) while the fringe of my intelligence floating unattached caught those distant sensations which after a time the mind draws in and works upon; the chime of bells; general mur

'here again there should be music. not that wild hunting-song, percival's music; but a painful, guttural, visceral, also soaring, lark-like, pealing song to replace these flagging, foolish transcripts--how much too deliberate! how much too reasonable!--which attempt to describe the flying moment of first love. a purple slide is slipped over the day. look at a room before she comes and after. look at the innocents outside pursuing their way. they neither see nor hear; yet on they go. moving oneself in this radiant yet gummy atmosphere how conscious one is of every m

"here," i said, "we are together without interruption." this freedom, this immunity, seemed then a conquest, and stirred in me such exaltation that i sometimes go there, even now, to bring back exaltation and percival. but it did not last. what torments one is the horrible activity of the mind's eye--how he fell, how he looked, where they carried him; men in loin-cloths, pulling ropes; the bandages and the mud. then comes the terrible pounce of memory, not to be foretold, not to be warded off--that i did not go with him to hampton court. that claw scratched; that fang tore; i did not go. in spite of his impatiently protesting that it did not matter; why interrupt, why spoil our moment of uninterrupted commun

'so the sincerity of the moment passed; so it became symbolical; and that i could not stand. let us commit any blasphemy of laughter and criticism rather than exude this lily-sweet glue; and cover him with phrases, i cried. therefore i broke off, and jinny, who was without future, or speculation, but respected the moment with complete integrity, gave her body a

 but why?" we sat in the garden; the farm carts came up dripping with hay; there was the usual gabble of rooks and doves; fruit was netted and covered over; the gardener dug. bees boomed down the purple tunnels of flowers; bees embedded themselves on the golden shields of sunflowers. little twigs were blown across the grass. how rhythmical, and half conscious and like something wrapped in mist it was; but to me hateful, like a net folding one's limbs in its meshes, cramping. she who had refused percival lent herself to this, to this covering over.

'sitting down on a bank to wait for my train, i thought then how we surrender, how we submit to the stupidity of nature. woods covered in thick green leafage lay in front of me. and by some flick of a scent or a sound on a nerve, the old image--the gardeners sweeping, the lady writing--returned. i saw the figures beneath the beech trees at elvedon. the gardeners swept; the lady at the table sat writing. but i now made the contribution of maturity to
