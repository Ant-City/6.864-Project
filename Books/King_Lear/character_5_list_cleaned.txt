[CHARACTER] - 
                gloucester's
older, legitimate son. [CHARACTER] plays many different roles, starting
out as a gullible fool easily tricked by his brother, then assuming
a disguise as a mad beggar to evade his father's men, then carrying
his impersonation further to aid lear and gloucester, and finally
appearing as an armored champion to avenge his brother's treason.
[CHARACTER]'s propensity for disguises and impersonations makes it difficult
to characterize him effectively.
