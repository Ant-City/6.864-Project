had no opportunity of saying, or so much as thinking, anything else,
until he was clear of the old bailey; for, the crowd came pouring out
with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz
swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in
search of other carrion.




iv. congratulatory


from the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the
human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when
doctor manette, lucie manette, his daughter, mr. lorry, the solicitor
for the defence, and its counsel, mr. stryver, stood gathered round mr.
charles darnay--just released--congratulating him on his escape from
death.

it would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise
in doctor manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the
shoemaker of the garret in paris. yet, no one could have looked at him
twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation
had not extended to th

 long breath, he answered “yes.”

the friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the
impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be
released that night. the lights were nearly all extinguished in the
passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle,
and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning’s interest of
gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it.
walking between her father and mr. darnay, lucie manette passed into
the open air. a hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter
departed in it.

mr. stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back
to the robing-room. another person, who had not joined the group, or
interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning
against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled
out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. he now
stepped up to where mr. lorry and mr. darnay

is time was passed at cambridge, where he
read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a
contraband trade in european languages, instead of conveying greek
and latin through the custom-house. the rest of his time he passed in
london.

now, from the days when it was always summer in eden, to these days
when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has
invariably gone one way--charles darnay’s way--the way of the love of a
woman.

he had loved lucie manette from the hour of his danger. he had never
heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice;
he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it was
confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for
him. but, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassination
at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long,
long, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become the
mere mist of a dream--

d, that could not be surer than it is henceforth. in
the hour of my death, i shall hold sacred the one good remembrance--and
shall thank and bless you for it--that my last avowal of myself was made
to you, and that my name, and faults, and miseries were gently carried
in your heart. may it otherwise be light and happy!”

he was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be, and it was so
sad to think how much he had thrown away, and how much he every day kept
down and perverted, that lucie manette wept mournfully for him as he
stood looking back at her.

“be comforted!” he said, “i am not worth such feeling, miss manette. an
hour or two hence, and the low companions and low habits that i scorn
but yield to, will render me less worth such tears as those, than any
wretch who creeps along the streets. be comforted! but, within myself, i

 seen in his face.
but, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the
shrewd glance of mr. lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the
old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold
wind.

he gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot
which mr. lorry had hired in honour of the day. the rest followed in
another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange
eyes looked on, charles darnay and lucie manette were happily married.

besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little
group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling,
glanced on the bride’s hand, which were newly released from the
dark obscurity of one of mr. lorry’s pockets. they returned home to
breakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had
mingled with the poor shoemaker’s white locks in the paris garret, were
mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, o

his country--he submitted before the word emigrant in the present
acceptation by the tribunal was in use--to live by his own industry in
england, rather than on the industry of the overladen people of france.

what proof had he of this?

he handed in the names of two witnesses; theophile gabelle, and
alexandre manette.

but he had married in england? the president reminded him.

true, but not an english woman.

a citizeness of france?

yes. by birth.

her name and family?

“lucie manette, only daughter of doctor manette, the good physician who
sits there.”

this answer had a happy effect upon the audience. cries in exaltation
of the well-known good physician rent the hall. so capriciously were
the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious
countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as
if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him.

on these few steps of his dangerous way, charles darnay had set his
