                        prologue

    in troy, there lies the scene. from isles of greece
    the princes orgillous, their high blood chaf'd,
    have to the port of athens sent their ships
    fraught with the ministers and instruments
    of cruel war. sixty and nine that wore
    their crownets regal from th' athenian bay
    put forth toward phrygia; and their vow is made
    to ransack troy, within whose strong immures
    the ravish'd helen, menelaus' queen,
    with wanton paris sleeps-and that's the quarrel.
    to tenedos they come,
    and the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge
    their war-like fraughtage. now on dardan plains
    the fresh and yet unbruised greeks do pitch
    their brave pavilions: priam's six-gated city,
    dardan, and tymbria, helias, chetas, troien,
    and antenorides, with massy staples
    and corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,
    sperr up the sons of troy.
    now expectation, tickli

darus. well, she look'd yesternight fairer than ever i saw her
    look, or any woman else.
  troilus. i was about to tell thee: when my heart,
    as wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,
    lest hector or my father should perceive me,
    i have, as when the sun doth light a storm,
    buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile.
    but sorrow that is couch'd in seeming gladness
    is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.
  pandarus. an her hair were not somewhat darker than helen's-well,
    go to- there were no more comparison between the women. but, for
    my part, she is my kinswoman; i would not, as they term it,
    praise her, but i would somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as
    i did. i  will not dispraise your sister cassandra's wit; but-
  troilus. o pandarus! i tell thee, pandarus-
    when i do tell thee there my hopes lie drown'd,
    reply not in how many fathoms deep
    they lie indrench'd. i tell thee i am mad
    in cressid's love. thou a

faith, i'll not meddle in it. let her be as she is: if
    she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be not, she has the
    mends in her own hands.
  troilus. good pandarus! how now, pandarus!
  pandarus. i have had my labour for my travail, ill thought on of
    her and ill thought on of you; gone between and between, but
    small thanks for my labour.
  troilus. what, art thou angry, pandarus? what, with me?
  pandarus. because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair as
    helen. an she were not kin to me, she would be as fair a friday
    as helen is on sunday. but what care i? i care not an she were a
    blackamoor; 'tis all one to me.
  troilus. say i she is not fair?
  pandarus. i do not care whether you do or no. she's a fool to stay
    behind her father. let her to the greeks; and so i'll tell her
    the next time i see her. for my part, i'll meddle nor make no
    more i' th' matter.
  troilus. pandarus!
  pandarus. not i.
  troilus. sweet pandarus!

  troilus. peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!
    fools on both sides! helen must needs be fair,
    when with your blood you daily paint her thus.
    i cannot fight upon this argument;
    it is too starv'd a subject for my sword.
    but pandarus-o gods, how do you plague me!
    i cannot come to cressid but by pandar;
    and he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo
    as she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.

    and, like as there were husbandry in war,
    before the sun rose he was harness'd light,
    and to the field goes he; where every flower

    in hector's wrath.

  cressida. good morrow, uncle pandarus.
  pandarus. good morrow, cousin cressid. what do you talk of?- good
    morrow, alexander.-how do you, cousin? when were you at ilium?
  cressida. this morning, uncle.
  pandarus. what were you talking of when i came? was hector arm'd
    and gone ere you came to ilium? helen was not up, was she?
  cressida. hector was gone; but helen was not up.
  pandarus. e'en so. hector was stirring early.
  cressida. that were we talking of, and of his anger.
  pandarus. was he angry?
  cressida. so he says here.
  pandarus. true, he was so; i know the cause too; he'll lay about
    him today, i can tell them that. and there's troilus will not
    come far behind him; let them take heed of troilus, i can tell
    them that too.

  pandarus. th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another tale
    when th' other's come to't. hector shall not have his wit this
    year.
  cressida. he shall not need it if he have his own.

  cressida. no matter.
  pandarus. nor his beauty.

    complexion. i had as lief helen's golden tongue had commended
    troilus for a copper nose.
  pandarus. i swear to you i think helen loves him better than paris.
  cressida. then she's a merry greek indeed.
  pandarus. nay, i am sure she does. she came to him th' other day
    into the compass'd window-and you know he has not past three or
    four hairs on his chin-
  cressida. indeed a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
    particulars therein to a total.

    lift as much as his brother hector.

  pandarus. but to prove to you that helen loves him: she came and
    puts me her white hand to his cloven chin-
  cressida. juno have mercy! how came it cloven?
  pandarus. why, you know, 'tis dimpled. i think his smiling becomes
    him better than any man in all phrygia.
  cressida. o, he smiles valiantly!
  pandarus. does he not?
  cressida. o yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn!
  pandarus. why, go to, then! but to prove to you that helen loves
    troilus-
  cressida. troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll prove it so.
  pandarus. troilus! why, he esteems her no more than i esteem an
    addle egg.
  cressida. if you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
    head, you would eat chickens i' th' shell.
  pandarus. i cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his
    chin. indeed, she has a marvell's white hand, i must needs
    confess.
  cressida. without the rack.

  cressida. alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.
  pandarus. but there was such laughing! queen hecuba laugh'd that
    her eyes ran o'er.
  cressida. with millstones.
  pandarus. and cassandra laugh'd.
  cressida. but there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her
    eyes. did her eyes run o'er too?
  pandarus. and hector laugh'd.
  cressida. at what was all this laughing?
  pandarus. marry, at the white hair that helen spied on troilus'
    chin.
  cressida. an't had been a green hair i should have laugh'd too.
  pandarus. they laugh'd not so much at the hair as at his pretty
    answer.
  cressida. what was his answer?
  pandarus. quoth she 'here's but two and fifty hairs on your chin,
    and one of them is white.'
  cressida. this is her question.
  pandarus. that's true; make no question of that. 'two and fifty
    hairs,' quoth he 'and one white. that white hair is my father,

    these hairs is paris my husband?' 'the forked one,' quoth he,
    'pluck't out and give it him.' but there was such laughing! and
    helen so blush'd, and paris so chaf'd; and all the rest so
    laugh'd that it pass'd.
  cressida. so let it now; for it has been a great while going by.
  pandarus. well, cousin, i told you a thing yesterday; think on't.
  cressida. so i do.
  pandarus. i'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, and 'twere a
    man born in april.

    it's all one. by god's lid, it does one's heart good. yonder
    comes paris, yonder comes paris.

    look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too, is't not? why,
    this is brave now. who said he came hurt home to-day? he's not
    hurt. why, this will do helen's heart good now, ha! would i could
    see troilus now! you shall see troilus anon.

                      helenus passes

  cressida. who's that?
  pandarus. that's helenus. i marvel where troilus is. that's
    helenus. i think he went not forth to-day. that's helenus.
  cressida. can helenus fight, uncle?
  pandarus. helenus! no. yes, he'll fight indifferent well. i marvel
    where troilus is. hark! do you not hear the people cry 'troilus'?
    helenus is a priest.

    hack'd than hector's; and how he looks, and how he goes! o
    admirable youth! he never saw three and twenty. go thy way,
    troilus, go thy way. had i a sister were a grace or a daughter a
    goddess, he should take his choice. o admirable man! paris? paris
    is dirt to him; and, i warrant, helen, to change, would give an

    wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consum'd
    in hot digestion of this cormorant war-
    shall be struck off.' hector, what say you to't?

    than hector is. the wound of peace is surety,
    surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd
    the beacon of the wise, the tent that searches
    to th' bottom of the worst. let helen go.
    since the first sword was drawn about this question,
    every tithe soul 'mongst many thousand dismes
    hath been as dear as helen-i mean, of ours.
    if we have lost so many tenths of ours

    you know a sword employ'd is perilous,
    and reason flies the object of all harm.

    wip'd off in honourable keeping her.
    what treason were it to the ransack'd queen,
    disgrace to your great worths, and shame to me,
    now to deliver her possession up
    on terms of base compulsion! can it be
    that so degenerate a strain as this

    there's not the meanest spirit on our party
    without a heart to dare or sword to draw
    when helen is defended; nor none so noble
    whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfam'd
    where helen is the subject. then, i say,
    well may we fight for her whom we know well
    the world's large spaces cannot parallel.
  hector. paris and troilus, you have both said well;
    and on the cause and question now in hand
    have gloz'd, but superficially; not much
    unlike young men, whom aristode thought
    unfit to hear moral philosophy.

    of any true decision. nature craves
    all dues be rend'red to their owners. now,
    what nearer debt in all humanity
    than wife is to the husband? if this law
    of nature be corrupted through affection;
    and that great minds, of partial indulgence
    to their benumbed wills, resist the same;
    there is a law in each well-order'd nation
    to curb those raging appetites that are
    most disobedient and refractory.
    if helen, then, be wife to sparta's king-
    as it is known she is-these moral laws
    of nature and of nations speak aloud
    to have her back return'd. thus to persist
    in doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
    but makes it much more heavy. hector's opinion
    is this, in way of truth. yet, ne'er the less,
    my spritely brethren, i propend to you
    in resolution to keep helen still;
    for 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependence
    upon our joint and several dignities.

  pandarus. my niece is horribly in love with a thing you have, sweet
    queen.
  helen. she shall have it, my lord, if it be not my lord paris.
  pandarus. he! no, she'll none of him; they two are twain.
  helen. falling in, after falling out, may make them three.
  pandarus. come, come. i'll hear no more of this; i'll sing you a
    song now.
  helen. ay, ay, prithee now. by my troth, sweet lord, thou hast a
    fine forehead.
  pandarus. ay, you may, you

 may.
  helen. let thy song be love. this love will undo us all. o cupid,
    cupid, cupid!
  pandarus. love! ay, that it shall, i' faith.
  paris. ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.
  pandarus. in good troth, it begins so.
[sings]

    love, love, nothing but love, still love, still more!
           for, oh, love's bow
           shoots buck and doe;
           the shaft confounds
           not that it wounds,
    but tickles still the sore.
    these lovers cry, o ho, they die!

   yet that which seems the wound to kill
    doth turn o ho! to ha! ha! he!
       so dying love lives still.
    o ho! a while, but ha! ha! ha!
    o ho! groans out for ha! ha! ha!-hey ho!

  helen. in love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.
  paris. he eats nothing but doves, love; and that breeds hot blood,
    and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and hot thoughts beget hot
    deeds, and hot deeds is love.
  pandarus. is this the generation of love: hot blood, hot thoughts,
    and hot deeds? why, they are vipers. is love a generation of
    vipers? sweet lord, who's a-field today?
  paris. hector, deiphobus, helenus, antenor, and all the gallantry
    of troy. i would fain

    have it so. how chance my brother troilus went not?
  helen. he hangs the lip at something. you know all, lord pandarus.
  pandarus. not i, honey-sweet queen. i long to hear how they spend
    to-day. you'll remember your brother's excuse?
  paris. to a hair.
  pandarus. farewell, sweet queen.
  helen. commend me to your niece.
  pandarus. i will, sweet queen.       exit. sound a retreat
  paris. they're come from the field. let us to priam's hall
    to greet the warriors. sweet helen, i must woo you
    to help unarm our hector. his stubborn buckles,
    with these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,
    shall more obey than to the edge of steel
    or force of greekish sinews; you shall do more
    than all the island kings-disarm great hector.

    who in your thoughts deserves fair helen best,
    myself or menelaus?
  diomedes. both alike:
    he merits well to have her that doth seek her,
    not making any scruple of her soilure,
    with such a hell of pain and world of charge;
    and you as well to keep her that defend her,
