mrs.[CHARACTER] 
 - 
                mrs. western, the foil of her brother squire western, is a caricature of the 
artificial city lady who always acts out of expediency. mrs. western prides 
herself on being adept at all intellectual pursuits--from politics to 
philosophy to feminism to amour--yet her ignorance reveals itself on 
numerous occasions (she thinks that socrates lectured to students instead of 
engaging in conversational debate). mrs. western's sole aim in the novel is to 
improve the western name by marrying off sophia to the richest, most prosperous 
man she can find.
