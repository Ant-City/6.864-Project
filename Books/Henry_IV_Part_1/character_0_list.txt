[CHARACTER] - 
                 the
ruling king of england. henry is not actually all that old, but
at the time the play opens, he has been worn down prematurely by
worries. he nurses guilty feelings about having won his throne through
a civil war that deposed the former king, richard ii. in addition,
his reign has not brought an end to the internal strife in england,
which erupts into an even bigger civil war in this play. finally,
he is vexed by the irresponsible antics of his eldest son, prince
harry. regal, proud, and somewhat aloof, king henry is not the main
character of the play that bears his name but, rather, its historical
focus. he gives the play a center of power and a sense of stability,
though his actions and emotions are largely secondary to the plot.
