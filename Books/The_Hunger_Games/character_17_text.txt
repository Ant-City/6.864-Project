row. the cameras will turn to them 
when the crowd is reacting to their handiwork. a large balco-
ny off a building to the right has been reserved for the game-
makers. television crews have claimed most of the other bal-
conies. but the city circle and the avenues that feed into it are 
completely packed with people. standing room only. at homes 
and community halls around the country, every television set 
is turned on. every citizen of panem is tuned in. there will be 
no blackouts tonight. 
caesar flickerman, the man who has hosted the interviews 
for more than forty years, bounces onto the stage. itâ€™s a little 
scary because his appearance has been virtually unchanged 
during all that time. same face under a coating of pure white 
makeup. same hairstyle that he dyes a different color for each 
hunger games. same ceremonial suit, midnight blue dotted 
with a thousand tiny electric bulbs that twinkle like stars.

er and thinner. in distr

lean my head against peetaâ€™s 
shoulder. his arm goes around me automatically, and i feel 
like iâ€™m back in the cave, curled up against him, trying to keep 
warm. his shirt is made of the same yellow material as my 
dress, but portiaâ€™s put him in long black pants. no sandals, ei-

ther, but a pair of sturdy black boots he keeps solidly planted 
on the stage. i wish cinna had given me a similar outfit, i feel 
so vulnerable in this flimsy dress. but i guess that was the 
point. caesar flickerman makes a few more jokes, and then itâ€™s 
time for the show. this will last exactly three hours and is re-
quired viewing for all of panem. as the lights dim and the seal 
appears on the screen, i realize iâ€™m unprepared for this. i do 
not want to watch my twenty-two fellow tributes die. i saw 
enough of them die the first time. my heart starts pounding 
and i have a strong impulse to run. how have the other victors 
faced this alone? during the highlights, they periodically show 
the winnerâ€

 snow gives it a 
twist and it separates into two halves. he places the first 
around peetaâ€™s brow with a smile. heâ€™s still smiling when he 
settles the second on my head, but his eyes, just inches from 
mine, are as unforgiving as a snakeâ€™s. 
thatâ€™s when i know that even though both of us would have 
eaten the berries, i am to blame for having the idea. iâ€™m the in-
stigator. iâ€™m the one to be punished. 
much bowing and cheering follows. my arm is about to fall 
off from waving when caesar flickerman finally bids the au-
dience good night, reminding them to tune in tomorrow for 
the final interviews. as if they have a choice. 
peeta and i are whisked to the presidentâ€™s mansion for the 
victory banquet, where we have very little time to eat as capi-

 until i seem to radiate a soft, 
rosy glow. we make idle chitchat, but iâ€™m afraid to ask him 
anything of real importance because after the incident with 
the door, i canâ€™t shake the feeling that iâ€™m being watched con-
stantly. 
the interview takes place right down the hall in the sitting 
room. a space has been cleared and the love seat has been 
moved in and surrounded by vases of red and pink roses. 
there are only a handful of cameras to record the event. no 
live audience at least. 
caesar flickerman gives me a warm hug when i. come in. 
â€œcongratulations, katniss. how are you faring?â€ 
â€œfine. nervous about the interview,â€ i say. 
â€œdonâ€™t be. weâ€™re going to have a fabulous time,â€ he says, 
giving my cheek a reassuring pat. 
â€œiâ€™m not good at talking about myself,â€ i say. 
â€œnothing you say will be wrong,â€ he says. 
and i think, oh, caesar, if only that were true. but actually, 

president  snow  may  be  arranging  some  sort  of  â€œaccidentâ€  for 
me as we speak.

, thereâ€™s just this and we go home. then he canâ€™t watch 
us all the time,â€ says peeta. 
i feel a sort of shiver run through me and thereâ€™s no time to 
analyze why, because theyâ€™re ready for us. we sit somewhat 
formally on the love seat, but caesar says, â€œoh, go ahead and 
curl up next to him if you want. it looked very sweet.â€ so i tuck 
my feet up and peeta pulls me in close to him. 
someone counts backward and just like that, weâ€™re being 
broadcast live to the entire country. caesar flickerman is 
wonderful, teasing, joking, getting choked up when the occa-
sion presents itself. he and peeta already have the rapport 
they established that night of the first interview, that easy 
banter, so i just smile a lot and try to speak as little as possi-
ble. i mean, i have to talk some, but as soon as i can i redirect 
the conversation back to peeta. 
eventually though, caesar begins to pose questions that in-
sist on fuller answers. â€œwell, peeta, we know, from our days in 
the cave, that i
