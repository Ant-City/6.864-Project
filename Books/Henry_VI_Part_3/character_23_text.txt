is part

   king. but with the first, of all your chiefe affaires,
let me entreat (for i command no more)
that margaret your queene, and my sonne edward,
be sent for, to returne from france with speed:
for till i see them here, by doubtfull feare,
my ioy of libertie is halfe eclips'd

   clar. it shall bee done, my soueraigne, with all
speede

   king. my lord of somerset, what youth is that,
of whom you seeme to haue so tender care?
  somers. my liege, it is young henry, earle of richmond

   king. come hither, englands hope:

layes his hand on his head.

if secret powers suggest but truth
to my diuining thoughts,
this prettie lad will proue our countries blisse.
his lookes are full of peacefull maiestie,
his head by nature fram'd to weare a crowne,
his hand to wield a scepter, and himselfe
likely in time to blesse a regall throne:
make much of him, my lords; for this is hee
must helpe you more, then you are hurt by mee.
enter a poste.

 your brother,
and fled (as hee heares since) to burgundie

   warw. vnsauorie newes: but how made he escape?
  poste. he was conuey'd by richard, duke of gloster,
and the lord hastings, who attended him
in secret ambush, on the forrest side,
and from the bishops huntsmen rescu'd him:
for hunting was his dayly exercise

   warw. my brother was too carelesse of his charge.
but let vs hence, my soueraigne, to prouide
a salue for any sore, that may betide.

exeunt.

manet somerset, richmond, and oxford.

  som. my lord, i like not of this flight of edwards:
for doubtlesse, burgundie will yeeld him helpe,
and we shall haue more warres befor't be long.
as henries late presaging prophecie
did glad my heart, with hope of this young richmond:
so doth my heart mis-giue me, in these conflicts,
what may befall him, to his harme and ours.
therefore, lord oxford, to preuent the worst,
forthwith wee'le send him hence to brittanie,
till stormes be past of ciuill enmitie

i: for if edward re-possesse the crowne,
'tis like that richmond, with the rest, shall downe

   som. it shall be so: he shall to brittanie.
come therefore, let's about it speedily.

exeunt.

flourish. enter edward, richard, hastings, and souldiers.

  edw. now brother richard, lord hastings, and the rest,
yet thus farre fortune maketh vs amends,
and sayes, that once more i shall enterchange
my wained state, for henries regall crowne.
well haue we pass'd, and now re-pass'd the seas,
and brought desired helpe from burgundie.
what then remaines,
