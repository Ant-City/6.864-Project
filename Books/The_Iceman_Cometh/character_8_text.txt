times pretends. his sight is failing but is not as bad as he complains it is. he wears five-and-ten-cent-store spectacles which are so out of alignment that one eye at times peers half over one glass while the other eye looks half under the other. he has badly fitting store teeth, which click like castanets when he begins to fume. he is dressed in an old coat from one suit and pants from another.

in a chair facing right at the table in the second line, between the first two tables, front, sits willie oban, his head on his left arm outstretched along the table edge. he is in his late thirties, of average height, thin. his haggard, dissipated face has a small nose, a pointed chin, blue eyes with colorless lashes and brows. his blond hair, badly in need of a cut, clings in a limp part to his skull. his eyelids flutter continually as if any light were too strong for his eyes. the clothes he wears belong on a scarecrow. they seem constructed of an inferior grade of dirty blotting paper. his shoes are

ugh guy but sentimental, in his way, and good-natured. he signals to larry with a cautious "sstt" and motions him to see if hope is asleep. larry rises from his chair to look at hope and nods to rocky. rocky goes back in the bar but immediately returns with a bottle of bar whiskey and a glass. he squeezes between the tables to larry.



rocky--(in a low voice out of the side of his mouth) make it fast. (larry pours a drink and gulps it down. rocky takes the bottle and puts it on the table where willie oban is.) don't want de boss to get wise when he's got one of his tightwad buns on. (he chuckles with an amused glance at hope.) jees, ain't de old bastard a riot when he starts dat bull about turnin' over a new leaf? "not a damned drink on de house," he tells me, "and all dese bums got to pay up deir room rent. beginnin' tomorrow," he says. jees, yuh'd tink he meant it! (he sits down in the chair at larry's left.)

rocky--yeah, some kidder! remember how he woiks up dat gag about his wife, when he's cockeyed, cryin' over her picture and den springin' it on yuh all of a sudden dat he left her in de hay wid de iceman? (he laughs.) i wonder what's happened to him. yuh could set your watch by his periodicals before dis. always got here a coupla days before harry's birthday party, and now he's on'y got till tonight to make it. i hope he shows soon. dis dump is like de morgue wid all dese bums passed out. (willie oban jerks and twitches in his sleep and begins to mumble. they watch him.)

willie--(blurts from his dream) it's a lie! (miserably) papa! papa!

larry--poor devil. (then angry with himself) but to hell with pity! it does no good. i'm through with it!

rocky--dreamin' about his old man. from what de old-timers say, de old gent sure made a pile of dough in de bucket-shop game before de cops got him. (he considers willie frowningly.) jees, i've seen him bad before but never dis bad. look at dat get-up

he force. (he nods at joe.) joe here has a yesterday in the same flush period. he ran a colored gambling house then and was a hell of a sport, so they say. well, that's our whole family circle of inmates, except the two barkeeps and their girls, three ladies of the pavement that room on the third floor.

parritt--(bitterly) to hell with them! i never want to see a whore again! (as larry flashes him a puzzled glance, he adds confusedly) i mean, they always get you in dutch. (while he is speaking willie oban has opened his eyes. he leans toward them, drunk now from the effect of the huge drink he took, and speaks with a mocking suavity.)

willie--why omit me from your who's who in dypsomania, larry? an unpardonable slight, especially as i am the only inmate of royal blood. (to parritt--ramblingly) educated at harvard, too. you must have noticed the atmosphere of culture here. my humble contribution. yes, generous stranger--i trust you're generous--i was born in the purple, the son, but unfortunatel

chuck--(angrily) can yuh beat de noive of dat dinge! jees, if i wasn't dressed up, i'd go out and mop up de street wid him!

rocky--aw, let him go, de poor old dope! him and his gamblin' house! he'll be back tonight askin' harry for his room and bummin' me for a ball. (vengefully) den i'll be de one to smash de glass. i'll loin him his place! (the swinging doors are pushed open and willie oban enters from the street. he is shaved and wears an expensive, well-cut suit, good shoes and clean linen. he is absolutely sober, but his face is sick, and his nerves in a shocking state of shakes.)

chuck--another guy all dolled up! got your clothes from solly's, huh, willie? (derisively) now yuh can sell dem back to him again tomorrow.

willie--(stiffly) no, i--i'm through with that stuff. never again. (he comes to the bar.)

rocky--(sympathetically) yuh look sick, willie. take a ball to pick y

ts him and turns to the party. they are all very drunk now, just a few drinks ahead of the passing-out stage, and hilariously happy about it.) bejees, let's sing! let's celebrate! it's my birthday party! bejees, i'm oreyeyed! i want to sing! (he starts the chorus of "she's the sunshine of paradise alley," and instantly they all burst into song. but not the same song. each starts the chorus of his or her choice. jimmy tomorrow's is "a wee dock and doris"; ed mosher's, "break the news to mother"; willie oban's, the sailor lad ditty he sang in act one; general wetjoen's, "waiting at the church"; mcgloin's, "tammany"; captain lewis's, "the old kent road"; joe's, "all i got was sympathy"; pearl's and margie's, "everybody's doing it"; rocky's, "you great big beautiful doll"; chuck's, "the curse of an aching heart"; cora's, "the oceana roll"; while hugo jumps to his feet and, pounding on the table with his fist, bellows in his guttural basso the french revolutionary "carmagnole." a weird cacophony resul
