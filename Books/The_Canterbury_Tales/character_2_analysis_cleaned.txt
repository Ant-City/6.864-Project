the [CHARACTER]
one of two female storytellers (the other is the prioress),
the wife has a lot of experience under her belt. she has traveled
all over the world on pilgrimages, so canterbury is a jaunt compared
to other perilous journeys she has endured. not only has she seen
many lands, she has lived with five husbands. she is worldly in
both senses of the word: she has seen the world and has experience
in the ways of the world, that is, in love and sex.
rich and tasteful, the wife's clothes veer a bit toward
extravagance: her face is wreathed in heavy cloth, her stockings
are a fine scarlet color, and the leather on her shoes is soft,
fresh, and brand new--all of which demonstrate how wealthy she has
become. scarlet was a particularly costly dye, since it was made
from individual red beetles found only in some parts of the world.
the fact that she hails from bath, a major english cloth-making
town in the middle ages, is reflected in both her talent as a seamstress
and her stylish garments. bath at this time was fighting for a place
among the great european exporters of cloth, which were mostly in
the netherlands and belgium. so the fact that the wife's sewing
surpasses that of the cloth makers of "ipres and of gaunt" (ypres
and ghent) speaks well of bath's (and england's) attempt to outdo
its overseas competitors.

although she is argumentative and enjoys talking, the
wife is intelligent in a commonsense, rather than intellectual,
way. through her experiences with her husbands, she has learned
how to provide for herself in a world where women had little independence or
power. the chief manner in which she has gained control over her husbands
has been in her control over their use of her body. the wife uses
her body as a bargaining tool, withholding sexual pleasure until
her husbands give her what she demands.
