leonine.
these roguing thieves serve the great pirate valdes;
and they hav seized marina. let her go:
thre's no hope she will return. i'll swear she's dead
and thrown into the sea. but i'll see further:
perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,
not carry her aboard.  if she remain,
whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain.

sir?

pandar.
search the market narrowly; mytilene is full of gallants. we lost
too much money this mart by being too wenchless.

bawd.
we were never so much out of creatures. we have but poor three,
and they can do no more than they can do; and they with continual
action are even as good as rotten.

pandar.
therefore let's have fresh ones, whate'r we pay for them.  if
there be not a conscience to be used in every trade, we shall
never prosper.

thou sayest true: 'tis not our bringing up of poor bastards, --
as, i think, i have bought up some eleven --

boult.
ay, to eleven; and brought them down again. but shall i search
the market?

bawd.
what else, man?  the stuff we have, a strong wind will blo it to
pieces, they are so pitifully sodden.

pandar.
thou sayest true; they're too unwholesome, o' conscience. the
poor transylvanian is dead, that lay with the little baggage.

boult.
ay, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat for worms.
but i'll go search the market.

three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a proportion to
live quietly, and so give over.

bawd.
wgy to give over, i pray you? is it a shame to get when we are
old?

pandar.
o, our credit comes not in like the commodity , nor the commodity
wages not with the danger: therfore, if in our youths we could
pick up some pretty estate, 'twere not amiss to keep our door

be strong with us for giving over.

bawd.
come, others sorts offend as well as we.

pandar.
as well as we! ay, and better too; we offend worse. neither is
our profession any trade; it's no calling.  but here comes boult.

boult
[to marina.]
come your ways. my masters, you say she's a virgin?

first pirate.
o, sir, we doubt it not.

boult.
master, i have gone through for this piece, you see: if you like
her, so; if not, i have lost my earnest.

bawd.
boult, has she any qualities?

boult.
she has a good face, speaks well, and has excellent clothes:
ther's no further necessity of qualities can make her be refused.

bawd.
what is her price, boult?

boult.
i cannot be baited one doit of a thousand pieces.

pandar.
well, follow me, my masters, you shall have your money presently.
wife, take her in; instruct her wha

[exeunt pandar and pirates.]

bawd.
boult, take you the marks of her, the colour of her hair,
complexion, height, age, with warrant of her virginity; and cry
'he that will give most shall have her first.' such a maidenhead
were no cheap thing, if men were as they have been. get this
done as i command you.

boult.
performance shall follow.

alack that leonine was so slack, so slow!
he should have struck, not spoke; or that these pirates,
not enough barbarous, had not o'erboard thrown me

why lament you, pretty one?

marina.
that i am pretty.

marina.
an honest woman, or not a woman.

bawd.
marry, whip the, gosling: i think i shall have something to do
with you. come, you're a young foolish sapling, and must be bowed
as i would have you.

marina.

bawd.
if it please the gods to defend you by men, then men must comfort
you, men must feed you, men must stir you up.  boult's returned.

[re-enter boult.]

now, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?

boult.
i have cried her almost to the number of her hairs; i have drawn
her picture with my voice.

bawd.
and i prithee tell me, how dost thou find the inclination of the
people, especially of the younger sort?

boult.
'faith, they listened to me as they would have hearkened to their
father's testament.  there was a spaniard's mouth so watered,
that he went to bed to her very description.

boult.
to-night, to-night. but, mistress, do you know the french knight
that cowers i' the hams?

bawd.
who, monsieur veroles?

boult.
ay, he: he offered to cut a caper at the proclamation; but he
made a groan at it, and swore he would see her to-morrow.

bawd.
well. well; as for him, he brought his disease hither: here he
does but repair it. i know he will come in our shadow, to
scatter his crowns in the sun.

boult.
well, if we had of every nation a traveller, we should lodge them
with this sign.

[to marina.]
pray you, come hither awhile. you have fortunes coming upon you.
mark me: you must seem to do that fearfully which you commit
willingly, despise profit where you have most gain. to weep that
you live as ye do makes pity in your lovers: seldom but that
pity begets you a good opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.

marina.
i understand you not.

boult.
o, take her home, mistress, take

bawd.
thou sayest true, i' faith so they must; for your bride goes to
that with shame which is her way to go with warrant.

boult.
'faith, some do and some do not. but, mistress, if i have
bargained for the joint, --

bawd.
thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.

boult.
i may so.

bawd.
who should deny it? come young one, i like the manner of your
garments well.

boult.
ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.

bawd.
boult, spend thou that in the town: report what a sojourner we
have; you'll lose nothing by custom. when nature framed this
piece, she meant thee a good turn; therefore say what a paragon
she is, and thou hast the harvest out of thine own report.

boult.
i warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake the beds of
eels as my giving out her beauty stir up the lewdly-inclined.
i'll bring home some to-night.

here.

bawd.
fie, fie upon her! she's able to freeze the god priapus, and undo
a whole generation. we must either get her ravished, or be rid of
her. when she should do for clients her fitment, and do me the
kindness of our profession, she has me her quirks, her reasons,
her master reasons, her prayers, her knees; that she would make
a puritan of the devil, if he should cheapen a kiss of her.

'faith, there's no way to be rid on't but by the way to the pox.

we should have both lord and lown, if the peevish baggage would
but give way to customers.

how now!  how a dozen of virginities?

bawd.

boult.
i am glad to see your honour in good health.

lysimachus.
you may so; 'tis the better for you that your resorters stand
upon sound legs. how now! wholesome iniquity have you that a
man may deal withal, and defy the surgeon?

lysimachus.
well, call forth, call forth.

for flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall see a rose;
and she were a rose indeed, if she had but --

lysimachus.
what, prithee?

boult.
o, sir, i can be modest.

lysimachus.
that dignifies the renown of a bawd, no less than it gives a good
report to a number to be chaste.

bawd.
here comes that which grows to the stalk; never plucked yet, i
can assure you.

[re-enter boult with marina.]

is she not a fair creature?

lysimachus.
'faith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea. well, there's
for you:  leave us.

what he will do graciously, i will thankfully receive.

i cannot be offended with my trade. please you to name it.

she makes our profession as it were to stink afore the face of

her virginity, and make the rest malleable.

what canst thou wish thine enemy to be?

why, i could wish him to he my master, or rather, my mistress.

marina.
neither of these are so had as thou art,
since they do better thee in their command.
thou hold'st a place, for which the pained'st fiend
of hell would not in reputation change:
thou art the damned doorkeeper to every
coistrel that comes inquiring for his tib;

as hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.

and i will undertake all these to teach.

yield many scholars.

but can you teach all this you speak of?

marina.
prove that i cannot, take me home again,
and prostitute me to the basest groom
that doth frequent your house.

well, i will see what i can do for thee: if i can place thee, i
will.

their consent:  therefore i will make them acquainted with your
