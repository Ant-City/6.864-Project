 would sit
with her hands clasped and her cheeks wet and all her body a-tremble,
hearing in the wailing melodies the voices of the unborn generations
which cried out in her for life.


marijaâ€™s lesson came just in time to save ona from a similar fate.
ona, too, was dissatisfied with her place, and had far more reason than
marija. she did not tell half of her story at home, because she saw it
was a torment to jurgis, and she was afraid of what he might do. for
a long time ona had seen that miss henderson, the forelady in her
department, did not like her. at first she thought it was the old-time
mistake she had made in asking for a holiday to get married. then she
concluded it must be because she did not give the forelady a present
occasionally--she was the kind that took presents from the girls, ona
learned, and made all sorts of discriminations in favor of those who
gave them. in the end, however, ona discovered that it was even worse
than that. miss henderson was a newcomer, and it was some t

was a witchâ€™s caldron. there were some of the girls who were of her own
sort, who were willing to toady to her and flatter her; and these would
carry tales about the rest, and so the furies were unchained in the
place. worse than this, the woman lived in a bawdy-house downtown, with
a coarse, red-faced irishman named connor, who was the boss of the
loading-gang outside, and would make free with the girls as they went
to and from their work. in the slack seasons some of them would go with
miss henderson to this house downtown--in fact, it would not be too much
to say that she managed her department at brownâ€™s in conjunction with
it. sometimes women from the house would be given places alongside of
decent girls, and after other decent girls had been turned off to make
room for them. when you worked in this womanâ€™s department the house
downtown was never out of your thoughts all day--there were always
whiffs of it to be caught, like the odor of the packingtown rendering
plants at night, when

oud, her voice like the voice of some wild beast:
â€œah! ah! i canâ€™t! i canâ€™t do it!â€

â€œwhy canâ€™t you do it?â€ he shouted.

â€œi donâ€™t know how!â€

he sprang and caught her by the arm, lifting her up, and glaring into
her face. â€œtell me where you were last night!â€ he panted. â€œquick, out
with it!â€

then she began to whisper, one word at a time: â€œi--was in--a
house--downtown--â€

â€œwhat house? what do you mean?â€

she tried to hide her eyes away, but he held her. â€œmiss hendersonâ€™s
house,â€ she gasped. he did not understand at first. â€œmiss hendersonâ€™s
house,â€ he echoed. and then suddenly, as in an explosion, the horrible
truth burst over him, and he reeled and staggered back with a scream.
he caught himself against the wall, and put his hand to his forehead,
staring about him, and whispering, â€œjesus! jesus!â€

an instant later he leaped at her, as she lay groveling at his feet.
he seized her by the throat. â€œtell me!â€ he gasped, hoarsely. â€œquick!

he spoke again she did not open them. â€œhe told me--he
would have me turned off. he told me he would--we would all of us lose
our places. we could never get anything to do--here--again. he--he meant
it--he would have ruined us.â€

jurgisâ€™ arms were shaking so that he could scarcely hold himself up,
and lurched forward now and then as he listened. â€œwhen--when did this
begin?â€ he gasped.

â€œat the very first,â€ she said. she spoke as if in a trance. â€œit was
all--it was their plot--miss hendersonâ€™s plot. she hated me. and he--he
wanted me. he used to speak to me--out on the platform. then he began
to--to make love to me. he offered me money. he begged me--he said he
loved me. then he threatened me. he knew all about us, he knew we would
starve. he knew your boss--he knew marijaâ€™s. he would hound us to death,
he said--then he said if i would--if i--we would all of us be sure
of work--always. then one day he caught hold of me--he would not let
go--he--he--â€

â€œwhere was this?â€

 and
oh, it was so cold! i tried, and then the third day ona went with me--â€

â€œona!â€

â€œyes. she tried to get to work, too. she had to. we were all starving.
but she had lost her place--â€

jurgis reeled, and gave a gasp. â€œshe went back to that place?â€ he
screamed. â€œshe tried to,â€ said stanislovas, gazing at him in perplexity.
â€œwhy not, jurgis?â€

the man breathed hard, three or four times. â€œgo--on,â€ he panted,
finally.

â€œi went with her,â€ said stanislovas, â€œbut miss henderson wouldnâ€™t take
her back. and connor saw her and cursed her. he was still bandaged
up--why did you hit him, jurgis?â€ (there was some fascinating mystery
about this, the little fellow knew; but he could get no satisfaction.)

jurgis could not speak; he could only stare, his eyes starting out. â€œshe
has been trying to get other work,â€ the boy went on; â€œbut sheâ€™s so weak
she canâ€™t keep up. and my boss would not take me back, either--ona says
he knows connor, and thatâ€™s the reason; the

and there would be more shouting; and then a brief silence, and more
bulletins. there would come messages from the secretaries of neighboring
states, reporting their achievements; the vote of indiana had gone from
2,300 to 12,000, of wisconsin from 7,000 to 28,000; of ohio from 4,800
to 36,000! there were telegrams to the national office from enthusiastic
individuals in little towns which had made amazing and unprecedented
increases in a single year: benedict, kansas, from 26 to 260; henderson,
kentucky, from 19 to 111; holland, michigan, from 14 to 208; cleo,
oklahoma, from 0 to 104; martinâ€™s ferry, ohio, from 0 to 296--and many
more of the same kind. there were literally hundreds of such towns;
there would be reports from half a dozen of them in a single batch of
telegrams. and the men who read the despatches off to the audience were
old campaigners, who had been to the places and helped to make the
vote, and could make appropriate comments: quincy, illinois, from 189 to
