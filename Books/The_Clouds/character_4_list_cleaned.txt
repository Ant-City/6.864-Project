[CHARACTER] - 
      a personified school of thought. [CHARACTER] is just argument's necessary foil. like socrates, [CHARACTER] represents all that is wrong with sophistry and the "new education"--the specious moral content masked by slippery, well-wrought persuasion and rhetoric. like pheidippides, [CHARACTER] is smug and disdainful of tradition. he has a facile mind, if not necessarily an upright set of values.
