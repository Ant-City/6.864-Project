er the usual time of the exercise in meditation had passed, govinda
rose.  the evening had come, it was time to perform the evening's ablution.
he called siddhartha's name.  siddhartha did not answer.  siddhartha sat
there lost in thought, his eyes were rigidly focused towards a very
distant target, the tip of his tongue was protruding a little between
the teeth, he seemed not to breathe.  thus sat he, wrapped up in
contemplation, thinking om, his soul sent after the brahman as an arrow.

once, samanas had travelled through siddhartha's town, ascetics on a
pilgrimage, three skinny, withered men, neither old nor young, with
dusty and bloody shoulders, almost naked, scorched by the sun,
surrounded by loneliness, strangers and enemies to the world, strangers
and lank jackals in the realm of humans.  behind them blew a hot scent
of quiet passion, of destructive service, of merciless self-denial.

in the evening, after the hour of contemplation, siddhartha spoke to
govinda:  "early tomorrow mornin

g, my friend, siddhartha will go to the
samanas.  he will become a samana."

govinda turned pale, when he heard these words and read the decision in
the motionless face of his friend, unstoppable like the arrow shot from
the bow.  soon and with the first glance, govinda realized:  now it is
beginning, now siddhartha is taking his own way, now his fate is
beginning to sprout, and with his, my own.  and he turned pale like a
dry banana-skin.

"o siddhartha," he exclaimed, "will your father permit you to do that?"

siddhartha looked over as if

he was just waking up.  arrow-fast he read
in govinda's soul, read the fear, read the submission.

"o govinda," he spoke quietly, "let's not waste words.  tomorrow, at
daybreak i will begin the life of the samanas.  speak no more of it."

siddhartha entered the chamber, where his father was sitting on a mat of
bast, and stepped behind his father and remained standing there, until
his father felt that someone was standing behind him.  quoth the
brahman:  "is that you, siddhartha?  then say what you came to say."

quoth siddhartha: "with your permission, my father.  i came to tell you
that it is my longing to leave your house tomorrow and go to the
ascetics.  my desire is to become a samana.  may my father

blution."

he took his hand from the shoulder of his son and went outside.
siddhartha wavered to the side, as he tried to walk.  he put his limbs
back under control, bowed to his father, and went to his mother to do as
his father had said.

as he slowly left on stiff legs in the first light of day the still
quiet town, a shadow rose near the last hut, who had crouched there,
and joined the pilgrim--govinda.

"you have come," said siddhartha and smiled.

"i have come," said govinda.




with the samanas

in the evening of this day they caught up with the ascetics, the skinny
samanas, and offered them their companionship and--obedience.  they
were accepted.

siddhartha gave his garments to a poor brahman in the street.  he wore
nothing more than the loincloth and the earth-coloured, unsown cloak.
he ate only once a day, and never something cooked.  he fasted for
fifteen days.  he fasted for twenty-eight days.  the flesh waned from
his thighs and cheeks.  feverish dreams flickered from his enlar

wounds dripped pus, and siddhartha stayed rigidly, stayed motionless,
until no blood flowed any more, until nothing stung any more, until
nothing burned any more.

siddhartha sat upright and learned to breathe sparingly, learned to
get along with only few breathes, learned to stop breathing.  he
learned, beginning with the breath, to calm the beat of his heart,
leaned to reduce the beats of his heart, until they were only a few and
almost none.

instructed by the oldest if the samanas, siddhartha practised
self-denial, practised meditation, according to a new samana rules.
a heron flew over the bamboo forest--and siddhartha accepted the heron
into his soul, flew over forest and mountains, was a heron, ate fish,
felt the pangs of a heron's hunger, spoke the heron's croak, died a
heron's death.  a dead jackal was lying on the sandy bank, and

r in the gap, where he
could escape from the cycle, where the end of the causes, where an
eternity without suffering began.  he killed his senses, he killed his
memory, he slipped out of his self into thousands of other forms, was an
animal, was carrion, was stone, was wood, was water, and awoke every
time to find his old self again, sun shone or moon, was his self again,
turned round in the cycle, felt thirst, overcame the thirst, felt new
thirst.

siddhartha learned a lot when he was with the samanas, many ways leading
away from the self he learned to go.  he went the way of self-denial
by means of pain, through voluntarily suffering and overcoming pain,
hunger, thirst, tiredness.  he went the way of self-denial by means of
meditation, through imagining the mind to be void of all conceptions.
these and other ways he learned to go, a thousand times he left his
self, for hours and days he remained in the non-self.  but though the
ways led away from the self, their end nevertheless always led

me efforts.  they rarely spoke to one another, than the service
and the exercises required.  occasionally the two of them went through
the villages, to beg for food for themselves and their teachers.

"how do you think, govinda," siddhartha spoke one day while begging
this way, "how do you think did we progress?  did we reach any goals?"

govinda answered:  "we have learned, and we'll continue learning.
you'll be a great samana, siddhartha.  quickly, you've learned every
exercise, often the old samanas have admired you.  one day, you'll be
a holy man, oh siddhartha."

quoth siddhartha:  "i can't help but feel that it is not like this, my
friend.  what i've learned, being among the samanas, up to this day,
this, oh govinda, i could have learned more quickly and by simpler
means.  in every tavern of that part of a town where the whorehouses
are, my friend, among carters and gamblers i could have learned it."

quoth govinda:  "siddhartha is putting me on.  how could you have
learned meditation, 
 
 ___________________________
 
ascended many a level."

siddhartha answered:  "how old, would you think, is our oldest samana,
our venerable teacher?"

quoth govinda:  "our oldest one might be about sixty years of age."

and siddhartha:  "he has lived for sixty years and has not reached the
nirvana.  he'll turn seventy and eighty, and you and me, we will grow
just as old and will do our exercises, and will fast, and will meditate.
but we will not reach the nirvana, he won't and we won't.  oh govinda,
i believe out of all the samanas out there, perhaps not a single one,
not a single one, will reach the nirvana.  we find comfort, we find
numbness, we learn feats, to deceive others.  but the most important
thing, the path of paths, we will not find."

"if you only," spoke govinda, "wouldn't speak such terrible words,
siddhartha!  how could it be that among so many learned men, among so
many brahmans, among so many austere and venerable samanas, among so
many who are searching, so many who are eagerly trying, so many holy
men,
 
 ___________________________
 
 no one will find the path of paths?"

but siddhartha said in a voice which contained just as much sadness as
mockery, with a quiet, a slightly sad, a slightly mocking voice:  "soon,
govinda, your friend will leave the path of the samanas, he has walked
along your side for so long.  i'm suffering of thirst, oh govinda, and
on this long path of a samana, my thirst has remained as strong as ever.
i always thirsted for knowledge, i have always been full of questions.
i have asked the brahmans, year after year, and i have asked the holy
vedas, year after year, and i have asked the devote samanas, year after
year.  perhaps, oh govinda, it had been just as well, had been just as
smart and just as profitable, if i had asked the hornbil

within me and within you and within every creature.  and so i'm
starting to believe that this knowledge has no worser enemy than the
desire to know it, than learning."

at this, govinda stopped on the path, rose his hands, and spoke:  "if
you, siddhartha, only would not bother your friend with this kind of
talk!  truly, you words stir up fear in my heart.  and just consider:
what would become of the sanctity of prayer, what of the venerability of
the brahmans' caste, what of the holiness of the samanas, if it was as
you say, if there was no learning?!  what, oh siddhartha, what would
then become of all of this what is holy, what is precious, what is
venerable on earth?!"

and govinda mumbled a verse to himself, a verse from an upanishad:

he who ponderingly, of a purified spirit, loses himself in the
meditation of atman, unexpressable by words is his blissfulness of his
heart.

but siddhartha remained silent.  he thought about the words which
govinda had said to him and thought the words thro
 
 ___________________________
 
ugh to their end.

yes, he thought, standing there with his head low, what would remain of
all that which seemed to us to be holy?  what remains?  what can stand
the test?  and he shook his head.

at one time, when the two young men had lived among the samanas for
about three years and had shared their exercises, some news, a rumour, a
myth reached them after being retold many times:  a man had appeared,
gotama by name, the exalted one, the buddha, he had overcome the
suffering of the world in himself and had halted the cycle of rebirths.
he was said to wander through the land, teaching, surrounded by
disciples, without possession, without home, without a wife, in the
yellow cloak of an ascetic, but with a cheerful brow, a man of bliss,
and brahmans

and princes would bow down before him and would become his
students.

this myth, this rumour, this legend resounded, its fragrants rose up,
here and there; in the towns, the brahmans spoke of it and in the
forest, the samanas; again and again, the name of gotama, the buddha
reached the ears of the young men, with good and with bad talk, with
praise and with defamation.

it was as if the plague had broken out in a country and news had been
spreading around that in one or another place there was a man, a wise
man, a knowledgeable one, whose word and breath was enough to heal
everyone who had been infected with the pestilence, and as such news
would go through the land and everyone would talk about it, many would
belie

l, the world was sick, life was hard to bear--and
behold, here a source seemed to spring forth, here a messenger seemed
to call out, comforting, mild, full of noble promises.  everywhere
where the rumour of buddha was heard, everywhere in the lands of india,
the young men listened up, felt a longing, felt hope, and among the
brahmans' sons of the towns and villages every pilgrim and stranger was
welcome, when he brought news of him, the exalted one, the sakyamuni.

the myth had also reached the samanas in the forest, and also
siddhartha, and also govinda, slowly, drop by drop, every drop laden
with hope, every drop laden with doubt.  they rarely talked about it,
because the oldest one of the samanas did not like this myth.  he had
heard that this alleged buddha used to be an ascetic before and had
lived in the forest, but had then turned back to luxury and worldly
pleasures, and he had no high opinion of this gotama.

"oh siddhartha," govinda spoke one day to his friend.  "today, i was
in the

from magadha, who has seen the

my chest ache when i breathed, and thought to myself:  if only i would
too, if only we both would too, siddhartha and me, live to see the
hour when we will hear the teachings from the mouth of this perfected
man!  speak, friend, wouldn't we want to go there too and listen to the
teachings from the buddha's mouth?"

quoth siddhartha:  "always, oh govinda, i had thought, govinda would
stay with the samanas, always i had believed his goal was to live to be
sixty and seventy years of age and to keep on practising those feats and
exercises, which are becoming a samana.  but behold, i had not known
govinda well enough, i knew little of his heart.  so now you, my
faithful friend, want to take a new path and go there, where the buddha
spreads his teachings."

quoth govinda:  "you're mocking me.  mock me if you like, siddhartha!
but have you not also developed a desire, an eagerness, to hear these
teach

ings?  and have you not at one time said to me, you would not walk
the path of the samanas for much longer?"

at this, siddhartha laughed in his very own manner, in which his voice
assumed a touch of sadness and a touch of mockery, and said:  "well,
govinda, you've spoken well, you've remembered correctly.  if you
only remembered the other thing as well, you've heard from me, which is
that i have grown distrustful and tired against teachings and learning,
and that my faith in words, which are brought to us by teachers, is
small.  but let's do it, my dear, i am willing to listen to th

chings--though in my heart i believe that we've already tasted the
best fruit of these teachings."

quoth govinda:  "your willingness delights my heart.  but tell me, how
should this be possible?  how should the gotama's teachings, even before
we have heard them, have already revealed their best fruit to us?"

quoth siddhartha:  "let us eat this fruit and wait for the rest, oh
govinda!  but this fruit, which we already now received thanks to the
gotama, consisted in him calling us away from the samanas!  whether he
has also other and better things to give us, oh friend, let us await
with calm hearts."

on this very same day, siddhartha informed the oldest one of the samanas
of his decision, that he wanted to leave him.  he informed the oldest
one with all the courtesy and modesty becoming to a younger one and a
student.  but the samana became angry, because the two young men wanted
to leave him, and talked loudly and used crude swearwords.

govinda was startled and became embarrassed.  but si

is arms were hanging down; without power, he had fallen
victim to siddhartha's spell.  but siddhartha's thoughts brought the
samana under their control, he had to carry out, what they commanded.
and thus, the old man made several bows, performed gestures of blessing,
spoke stammeringly a godly wish for a good journey.  and the young men
returned the bows with thanks, returned the wish, went on their way with
salutations.

on the way, govinda said:  "oh siddhartha, you have learned more from
the samanas than i knew.  it is hard, it is very hard to cast a spell
on an old samana.  truly, if you had stayed there, you would soon have
learned to walk on water."

"i do not seek to walk on water," said siddhartha.  "let old samanas be
content with such feats!"




gotama

in the town of savathi, every child knew the name of the exalted buddha,
and every house was prepared to fill the alms-dish of gotama's
disciples, the silently begging ones.  near the town was gotama's
favourite place to stay, the g

and his people for a gift.

all tales and answers, which the two young ascetics had received in
their search for gotama's abode, had pointed them towards this area.
and arriving at savathi, in the very first house, before the door of
which they stopped to beg, food has been offered to them, and they
accepted the food, and siddhartha asked the woman, who handed them the
food:

"we would like to know, oh charitable one, where the buddha dwells, the
most venerable one, for we are two samanas from the forest and have
come, to see him, the perfected one, and to hear the teachings from his
mouth."

quoth the woman:  "here, you have truly come to the right place, you
samanas from the forest.  you should know, in jetavana, in the garden
of anathapindika is where the exalted one dwells.  there you pilgrims
shall spent the night, for there is enough space for the innumerable,
who flock here, to hear the teachings from his mouth."

this made govinda happy, and full of joy he exclaimed:  "w

oak, presenting his alms-dish in silence at the doors of
the houses, leaving with a filled dish."

delightedly, govinda listened and wanted to ask and hear much more.
but siddhartha urged him to walk on.  they thanked and left and hardly
had to ask for directions, for rather many pilgrims and monks as well
from gotama's community were on their way to the jetavana.  and since
they reached it at night, there were constant arrivals, shouts, and
talk of those who sought shelter and got it.  the two samanas,
accustomed to life in the forest, found quickly and without making any
noise a place to stay and rested there until the morning.

at sunrise, they saw with astonishment what a large crowd of believers
and curious people had spent the night here.  on all paths of the
marvellous grove, monks walked in yellow robes, under the trees they
sat here and there, in deep contemplation--or in a conversation about
spiritual matters, the shady gardens looked like a city, full of people,
bustling like bees.

esembling a
healthy child, the buddha walked, wore the robe and placed his feet
just as all of his monks did, according to a precise rule.  but his
face and his walk, his quietly lowered glance, his quietly dangling hand
and even every finger of his quietly dangling hand expressed peace,
expressed perfection, did not search, did not imitate, breathed softly
in an unwhithering calm, in an unwhithering light, an untouchable peace.

thus gotama walked towards the town, to collect alms, and the two
samanas recognised him solely by the perfection of his calm, by the
quietness of his appearance, in which there was no searching, no desire,
no imitation, no effort to be seen, only light and peace.

"today, we'll hear the teachings from his mouth." said govinda.

siddhartha did not answer.  he felt little curiosity for the teachings,
he did not believe that they would teach him anything new, but he had,
just as govinda had, heard the contents of this buddha's teachings
again and again, though these re

your refuge with the exalted buddha!"

siddhartha placed his hand on govinda's shoulder:  "you failed to hear
my good wish for you, oh govinda.  i'm repeating it:  i wish that you
would go this path up to its end, that you shall find salvation!"

in this moment, govinda realized that his friend had left him, and he
started to weep.

"siddhartha!" he exclaimed lamentingly.

siddhartha kindly spoke to him:  "don't forget, govinda, that you are
now one of the samanas of the buddha!  you have renounced your home
and your parents, renounced your birth and possessions, renounced your
free will, renounced all friendship.  this is what the teachings
require, this is what the exalted one wants.  this is what you wanted
for yourself.  tomorrow, oh govinda, i'll leave you."

for a long time, the friends continued walking in the grove; for a long
time, they lay there and found no sleep.  and over and over again,
govinda urged his friend, he should tell him why he wo

r i know there are
none, but to depart from all teachings and all teachers and to reach my
goal by myself or to die.  but often, i'll think of this day, oh exalted
one, and of this hour, when my eyes beheld a holy man."

the buddha's eyes quietly looked to the ground; quietly, in perfect
equanimity his inscrutable face was smiling.

"i wish," the venerable one spoke slowly, "that your thoughts shall not
be in error, that you shall reach the goal!  but tell me:  have you seen
the multitude of my samanas, my many brothers, who have taken refuge in
the teachings?  and do you believe, oh stranger, oh samana, do you
believe that it would be better for them all the abandon the teachings
and to return into the life the world and of desires?"

"far is such a thought from my mind," exclaimed siddhartha.  "i wish
that they shall all stay with the teachings, that they shall reach their
goal!  it is not my place to judge another person's life.  only for
myself, for myself alone, i must decide, i must cho

salvation from the self is what we samanas search for, oh exalted one.
if i merely were one of your disciples, oh venerable one, i'd fear that
it might happen to me that only seemingly, only deceptively my self
would be calm and be redeemed, but that in truth it would live on and
grow, for then i had replaced my self with the teachings, my duty to
follow you, my love for you, and the community of the monks!"

with half of a smile, with an unwavering openness and kindness,
gotama looked into the stranger's eyes and bid him to leave with

deeply, he inhaled, and for a moment, he felt cold and shivered.
nobody was thus alone as he was.  there was no nobleman who did not
belong to the noblemen, no worker that did not belong to the workers,
and found refuge with them, shared their life, spoke their language.
no brahman, who would not be regarded as brahmans and lived with them,
no ascetic who would not find his refuge in the caste of the samanas,
and even the most forlorn hermit in the forest was not just one and
alone, he was also surrounded by a place he belonged to, he also
belonged to a caste, in which he was at home.  govinda had become a
monk, and a thousand monks were his brothers, wore the same robe as he,
believed in his faith, spoke his language.  but he, siddhartha, where
did he belong to?  with whom would he share his life?  whose language
would he speak?

she lifted her head and looked up to him with a smile, so that he saw
the white in her eyes glistening.  he called out a blessing to her, as
it is the custom among travellers, and asked how far he still had to go
to reach the large city.  then she got up and came to him, beautifully
her wet mouth was shimmering in her young face.  she exchanged humorous
banter with him, asked whether he had eaten already, and whether it was
true that the samanas slept alone in the forest at night and were not
allowed to have any women with them.  while talking, she put her left
foot on his right one and made a movement as a woman does who would want
to initiate that kind of sexual pleasure with a man, which the textbooks
call "climbing a tree".  siddhartha felt his blood heating up, and since
in this moment he had to think of his dream again, he bend slightly
down to the woman and kissed with his lips the brown nipple of her
breast.  looking up, he saw

siddhartha thanked her and laughed, and when she found out that he had
not eaten anything yesterday and today, she sent for bread and fruits
and treated him to it.

"you've been lucky," she said when they parted, "i'm opening one door
after another for you.  how come?  do you have a spell?"

siddhartha said:  "yesterday, i told you i knew how to think, to wait,
and to fast, but you thought this was of no use.  but it is useful for
many things, kamala, you'll see.  you'll see that the stupid samanas are
learning and able to do many pretty things in the forest, which the
likes of you aren't capable of.  the day before yesterday, i was still a
shaggy beggar, as soon as yesterday i have kissed kamala, and soon i'll
be a merchant and have money and all those things you insist upon."

"well yes," she admitted.  "but where would you be without me?  what
would you be, if kamala wasn't helping you?"

"dear kamala," said siddhartha and straightened up to his full height,
"when i came to you into yo

rock into the water,
it will speed on the fastest course to the bottom of the water.  this
is how it is when siddhartha has a goal, a resolution.  siddhartha does
nothing, he waits, he thinks, he fasts, but he passes through the things
of the world like a rock through water, without doing anything, without
stirring; he is drawn, he lets himself fall.  his goal attracts him,
because he doesn't let anything enter his soul which might oppose the
goal.  this is what siddhartha has learned among the samanas.  this is
what fools call magic and of which they think it would be effected by
means of the daemons.  nothing is effected by daemons, there are no
daemons.  everyone can perform magic, everyone can reach his goals, if
he is able to think, if he is able to wait, if he is able to fast."

kamala listened to him.  she loved his voice, she loved the look from
his eyes.

"perhaps it is so," she said quietly, "as you say, friend.  but perhaps
it is also like this: that siddhartha is a handsome man, t

with very intelligent, cautious eyes, with a greedy mouth.  politely,
the host and the guest greeted one another.

"i have been told," the merchant began, "that you were a brahman, a
learned man, but that you seek to be in the service of a merchant.
might you have become destitute, brahman, so that you seek to serve?"

"no," said siddhartha, "i have not become destitute and have never been
destitute.  you should know that i'm coming from the samanas, with
whom i have lived for a long time."

"if you're coming from the samanas, how could you be anything but
destitute?  aren't the samanas entirely without possessions?"

"i am without possessions," said siddhartha, "if this is what you mean.
surely, i am without possessions.  but i am so voluntarily, and
therefore i am not destitute."

"but what are you planning to live of, being without possessions?"

"i haven't thought of this yet, sir.  for more than three years, i have

nate manner, and that
siddhartha surpassed him, the merchant, in calmness and equanimity, and
in the art of listening and deeply understanding previously unknown
people.  "this brahman," he said to a friend, "is no proper merchant and
will never be one, there is never any passion in his soul when he
conducts our business.  but he has that mysterious quality of those
people to whom success comes all by itself, whether this may be a good
star of his birth, magic, or something he has learned among samanas.
he always seems to be merely playing with out business-affairs, they
never fully become a part of him, they never rule over him, he is never
afraid of failure, he is never upset by a loss."

the friend advised the merchant:  "give him from the business he
conducts for you a third of the profits, but let him also be liable for
the same amount of the losses, when there is a loss.  then, he'll become
more zealous."

kamaswami followed the advice.  but siddhartha cared little about this.

"no," said siddhartha, "that's not the reason why.  kamaswami is just as
smart as i, and still has no refuge in himself.  others have it, who are
small children with respect to their mind.  most people, kamala, are
like a falling leaf, which is blown and is turning around through the
air, and wavers, and tumbles to the ground.  but others, a few, are
like stars, they go on a fixed course, no wind reaches them, in
themselves they have their law and their course.  among all the learned
men and samanas, of which i knew many, there was one of this kind, a
perfected one, i'll never be able to forget him.  it is that gotama,
the exalted one, who is spreading that teachings.  thousands of
followers are listening to his teachings every day, follow his
instructions every hour, but they are all falling leaves, not in
themselves they have teachings and a law."

kamala looked at him with a smile.  "again, you're talking about him,"
she said, "again, you're having a samana's thoughts."

experienced that
one time at the height of his youth, in those days after gotama's
sermon, after the separation from govinda, that tense expectation, that
proud state of standing alone without teachings and without teachers,
that supple willingness to listen to the divine voice in his own heart,
had slowly become a memory, had been fleeting; distant and quiet, the
holy source murmured, which used to be near, which used to murmur within
himself.  nevertheless, many things he had learned from the samanas, he
had learned from gotama, he had learned from his father the brahman,
had remained within him for a long time afterwards: moderate living,
joy of thinking, hours of meditation, secret knowledge of the self,
of his eternal entity, which is neither body nor consciousness.  many
a part of this he still had, but one part after another had been
submerged and had gathered dust.  just as a potter's wheel, once it has
been set in motion, will keep on turning for a long time and only slowly

upward fleeing,
goal of all thinking had ripped him out of and up from the multitude of
those seeking the same goal, when he wrestled in pain for the purpose of
brahman, when every obtained knowledge only kindled new thirst in him,
then again he had, in the midst of the thirst, in the midst of the pain
felt this very same thing:  "go on!  go on!  you are called upon!"  he
had heard this voice when he had left his home and had chosen the life
of a samana, and again when he had gone away from the samanas to that
perfected one, and also when he had gone away from him to the uncertain.
for how long had he not heard this voice any more, for how long had he
reached no height any more, how even and dull was the manner in which
his path had passed through life, for many long years, without a high
