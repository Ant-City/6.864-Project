t, the pools of career 
tributes from districts 1, 2, and 4 are the largest. but 
every district has managed to scrape up at least one 
female and one male victor.

the reapings go by quickly. peeta studiously puts 
stars by the names of the chosen tributes in his 
notebook. haymitch watches, his face devoid of 
emotion, as friends of his step up to take the stage. 
effie makes hushed, distressed comments like "oh, 
not cecelia" or "well, chaff never could stay out of a 
fight," and sighs frequently. 

for my part, i try to make some mental record of the 
other tributes, but like last year, only a few really 
stick in my head. there's the classically beautiful 
brother and sister from district 1 who were victors in 
consecutive years when i was little. brutus, a 
volunteer from district 2, who must be at least forty 
and apparently can't wait to get back in the arena. 
finnick, the handsome bronze-haired guy from 
district 4 who was c

rowned ten years ago at the age 
of fourteen. a hysterical young woman with flowing 
brown hair is also called from 4, but she's quickly 
replaced by a volunteer, an eighty-year-old woman 
who needs a cane to walk to the stage. then there's 
johanna mason, the only living female victor from 7, 
who won a few years back by pretending she was a 
weakling. the woman from 8 who effie calls cecelia, 
who looks about thirty, has to detach herself from the 
three kids who run up to cling to her. chaff, a man 
from 1 1 who i know to be one of haymitch 's 
particular friends, is also in. 

i'm called. then haymitch. and peeta volunteers. one 
of the announcers actually gets teary because it 
seems the odds will never be in our favor, we star- 
crossed lovers of district 12. then she pulls herself 
together to say she bets that "these will be the best 
games ever!" 

haymitch leaves the compartment without a word, 
and effie, after making a few unconnected comments 
about this tribute or that,

 the 
anthem plays, and as we make our final trip around 
the circle, am i wrong? or do i see the president 
fixated on me as well? 

peeta and i wait until the doors of the training center 
have closed behind us to relax. cinna and portia are 
there, pleased with our performance, and haymitch 
has made an appearance this year as well, only he's 
not at our chariot, he's over with the tributes of 
district 1 1 . i see him nod in our direction and then 
they follow him over to greet us. 

i know chaff by sight because i've spent years 
watching him pass a bottle back and forth with 
haymitch on television. he's dark skinned, about six 
feet tall, and one of his arms ends in a stump because 
he lost his hand in the games he won thirty years 
ago. i'm sure they offered him some artificial 
replacement, like they did peeta when they had to 
amputate his lower leg, but i guess he didn't take it. 

the woman, seeder, looks almost like she could be 
from the seam, with her olive skin and straight

mark her as from another district. she must be 
around sixty, but she still looks strong, and there's no 
sign she's turned to liquor or morphling or any other 
chemical form of escape over the years. before either 
of us says a word, she embraces me. i know somehow 
it must be because of rue and thresh. before i can 
stop myself, i whisper, "the families?" 

"they're alive," she says back softly before letting me 
go-

chaff throws his good arm around me and gives me a 
big kiss right on the mouth. i jerk back, startled, 
while he and haymitch guffaw. 

that's about all the time we get before the capitol 
attendants are firmly directing us toward the 
elevators. i get the distinct feeling they're not 
comfortable with the camaraderie among the victors, 
who couldn't seem to care less. as i walk toward the 
elevators, my hand still linked with peeta's, someone 
else rustles up to my side. the girl pulls off a

her tree, letting it drop to the floor, and then 
kicks it away in disgust. except for her forest green 
slippers, she doesn't have on a stitch of clothing. 
"that's better." 

we end up on the same elevator with her, and she 
spends the whole ride to the seventh floor chatting to 
peeta about his paintings while the light of his still- 
glowing costume reflects off her bare breasts. when 
she leaves, i ignore him, but i just know he's 
grinning. i toss aside his hand as the doors close 
behind chaff and seeder, leaving us alone, and he 
breaks out laughing. 

"what?" i say, turning on him as we step out on our 
floor. 

"it's you, katniss. can't you see?" he says. "what's 
me?" i say. 

"why they're all acting like this. finnick with his 
sugar cubes and chaff kissing you and that whole 
thing with johanna stripping down." he tries to take 
on a more serious tone, unsuccessfully. "they're 
playing with you because you're so... you know." 

"no, i don't know," i say. and i really have no id

een our strategy, hasn't it? to train like 
careers?" counters haymitch. "and who makes up 
the career pack is generally agreed upon before the 
games begin. peeta barely got in with them last year." 

i think of the loathing i felt when i discovered peeta 
was with the careers during the last games. "so we're 
to try to get in with finnick and brutus — is that what 
you're saying?" 

"not necessarily. everyone's a victor. make your own 
pack if you'd rather. choose who you like. i'd suggest 
chaff and seeder. although finnick's not to be 
ignored," says haymitch. "find someone to team up 
with who might be of some use to you. remember, 
you're not in a ring full of trembling children 
anymore. these people are all experienced killers, no 
matter what shape they appear to be in." 

maybe he's right. only who could i trust? seeder 
maybe. but do i really want to make a pact with her, 
only to possibly have to kill her later? no. still, i made 
a pact with rue under the same circumstances.

shown up. atala, the woman who runs training, 
begins her spiel right on time, unfazed by the poor 
attendance. maybe she expected it. i'm sort of 
relieved, because that means there are a dozen people 
i don't have to pretend to make friends with. atala 
runs through the list of stations, which include both 
combat and survival skills, and releases us to train. 

i tell peeta i think we'd do best to split up, thus 
covering more territory. when he goes off to chuck 
spears with brutus and chaff, i head over to the 
knot-tying station, hardly anyone ever bothers to visit 
it. i like the trainer and he remembers me fondly, 
maybe because i spent time with him last year. he's 
pleased when i show him i can still set the trap that 
leaves an enemy dangling by a leg from a tree. clearly 
he took note of my snares in the arena last year and 
now sees me as an advanced pupil, so i ask him to 
review every kind of knot that might come in handy 
and a few that 111 probably never use. i'd be co

"forget it," i say with a shake of my head. "it's a lot of 
things." 

"darius," he says. 

"darius. the games. haymitch making us team up 
with the others," i say.

"it can just be you and me, you know," he says. 



"i know. but maybe haymitch is right," i say. "don't 
tell him i said so, but he usually is, where the games 
are concerned." 

"well, you can have final say about our allies. but 
right now, i'm leaning toward chaff and seeder," says 
peeta. 

"i'm okay with seeder, not chaff," i say. "not yet, 
anyway." 

"come on and eat with him. i promise, i won't let him 
kiss you again," says peeta. 

chaff doesn't seem as bad at lunch. he's sober, and 
while he talks too loud and makes bad jokes a lot, 
most of them are at his own expense. i can see why 
he would be good for haymitch, whose thoughts run 
so darkly. but i'm still not sure i'm ready to team up 
with him. 

i try hard to be more sociable, not just with

what's going on since he keeps trying to stuff 
poisonous bugs in his mouth. i wish i could mention

could be so cruel as to sever such a deep bond. 
seeder quietly ruminates about how, back in district 
11, everyone assumes president snow is all-powerful. 
so if he's all-powerful, why doesn't he change the 
quell? and chaff, who comes right on her heels, 
insists the president could change the quell if he 
wanted to, but he must not think it matters much to 
anyone. 

by the time i'm introduced, the audience is an 
absolute wreck. people have been weeping and 
collapsing and even calling for change. the sight of 
me in my white silk bridal gown practically causes a 
riot. no more me, no more star-crossed lovers living 
happily ever after, no more wedding. i can see even 
caesar's professionalism showing some crack

ating through my bones, lets us know where we 
stand in the program. i automatically rise and, as i 
do, i sense peeta reaching out for me. tears run down 
his face as i take his hand. how real are the tears? is 
this an acknowledgment that he has been stalked by 
the same fears that i have? that every victor has? 
every parent in every district in panem? 

i look back to the crowd, but the faces of rue's 
mother and father swim before my eyes. their sorrow. 
their loss. i turn spontaneously to chaff and offer my 
hand. i feel my fingers close around the stump that 
now completes his arm and hold fast. 

and then it happens. up and down the row, the 
victors begin to join hands. some right away, like the 
morphlings, or wiress and beetee. others unsure but 
caught up in the demands of those around them, like 
brutus and enobaria. by the time the anthem plays 
its final strains, all twenty-four of us stand in one 
unbroken line in what must be the first public show 
of unity among the distri

can see the realization of this as the screens begin to

there's disorder on the stage now, too, as the lights 
go out and we're left to stumble back into the 
training center. i've lost hold of chaff, but peeta 
guides me into an elevator. finnick and johanna try 
to join us, but a harried peacekeeper blocks their way 
and we shoot upward alone. 

the moment we step off the elevator, peeta grips my 
shoulders. "there isn't much time, so tell me. is there 
anything i have to apologize for?" 

"nothing," i say. it was a big leap to take without my 
okay, but i'm just as glad i didn't know, didn't have 
time to second-guess him, to let any guilt over gale 
detract from how i really feel about

eight dead. plus eight from the first night. two-thirds 
of us gone in a day and a half. that must be some 
kind of record.

"they're really burning through us," says johanna. 
"who's left? besides us five and district two?" asks 
finnick. 

"chaff," says peeta, without needing to think about it. 
perhaps he's been keeping an eye out for him because 
of haymitch. 

a parachute comes down with a pile of bite-sized 
square-shaped rolls. "these are from your district, 
right, beetee?" peeta asks. 

"yes, from district three," he says. "how many are 
there?" 

finnick counts them, turning each one over in his 
hands before he sets it in a neat configuration. i don't 
know what it is with finnick and bread, but he seems 
obsessed with handling

 the tributes can hear me. 

peeta nods, and i can see him considering my 
proposition. weighing if the odds will be in our favor.

"tell you what," he says. "let's stick around until 
brutus and enobaria are dead. i think beetee's trying 
to put together some kind of trap for them now. then, 
i promise, well go." 

i'm not entirely convinced. but if we leave now, we'll 
have two sets of adversaries after us. maybe three, 
because who knows what chaffs up to? plus the 
clock to contend with. and then there's beetee to 
think of. johanna only brought him for me, and if we 
leave shell surely kill him. then i remember. i can't 
protect beetee, too. there can only be one victor and 
it has to be peeta. i must accept this. i must make 
decisions based on his survival only. 

"all right," i say. "we'll stay until the careers are 
dead. but that's the end of it." i turn and wave to 
finnick. "hey, finnick, come on in! we figured out 
how to make y

"katniss!" peeta's voice howls for me. but this time i 
don't answer. beetee still breathes faintly beside me. 
he and i will soon die. finnick and enobaria will die. 
peeta is alive. two cannons have sounded. brutus, 
johanna, chaff. two of them are already dead. that 
will leave peeta with only one tribute to kill. and that 
is the very best i can do. one enemy. 

enemy. enemy. the word is tugging at a recent 
memory. pulling it into the present. the look on 
haymitch's face. "katniss, when you're in the arena..." 
the scowl, the misgiving. "what?" i hear my own 
voice tighten as i bristle at some unspoken 
accusation. "you just remember who the enemy is," 
haymitch says. "that's all."

i raise my hand and find i have fingers that can move 
at my command again. i push myself to a sitting 
position and hold on to the padded table until the 
room settles into focus. my left arm is bandaged but 
the tubes dangle off stands by the bed. 

i'm alone except for beetee, who still lies in front of 
me, being sustained by his army of machines. where 
are the others, then? peeta, finnick, enobaria, and... 
and... one more, right? either johanna or chaff or 
brutus was still alive when the bombs began. i'm sure 
they'll want to make an example of us all. but where 
have they taken them? moved them from hospital to 
prison?

still resolved to. since i have failed to keep him safe in 
life, i must find him, kill him now before the capitol 
gets to choose the agonizing means of his death. i
