oing to die, he thought. frog had said that true terror is the kind men feel toward their
imagination.
katagiri cut the switch of his imagination and sank into a weightless silence.

when he woke up, he was in bed. he opened one eye, took a moment to survey his surroundings
and then opened the other eye. the first thing that entered his field of vision was a metal stand by
the head of the bed and an intravenous feeding tube that stretched from the stand to where he lay.
next he saw a nurse dressed in white. he realized he was lying on his back on a hard bed and
wearing some strange piece of clothing under which he seemed to be naked.
oh yeah, he thought, i was walking along the sidewalk when some guy shot me. probably in the
shoulder. the right one. he relived the scene in his mind. when he remembered the small black
gun in the young man’s hand, his heart made a disturbing thump. the sons of bitches were trying
to kill me! he thought. but it looks as if i made it through ok. my

the hospital room had no windows. he could not tell whether it was day or night. he had been
shot just before five in the evening. how much time had passed since then? had the hour of his
nighttime rendezvous with frog gone by? katagiri searched the room for a clock, but without his
glasses he could see nothing at a distance.
“excuse me,” he called to the nurse.
“oh, good. you’re finally awake,” the nurse said. 
“what time is it?”
she glanced at her watch.
“nine-fifteen.”
“p.m.?”
“don’t be silly; it’s morning!”
“nine-fifteen a.m.?” katagiri groaned, barely managing to lift his head from the pillow. the ragged
noise that emerged from his throat sounded like someone else’s voice. “nine-fifteen a.m. on
february 18?”
“right,” the nurse said, lifting her arm once more to check the date on her digital watch. “today

is
february 18, 1995.”
“wasn’t there a big earthquake in tokyo this morning?”
“in tokyo?”
“in tokyo.”
the nurse shook her head. “not as far as i know.”
he breathed a sigh of relief. whatever had happened, the earthquake at least had been averted.
“how’s my wound doing?”
“your wound?” she asked. “what wound?”
“where i was shot.”
“shot?”
“yeah, near the entrance to the trust bank. some young guy shot me. in the right shoulder, i
think.”
the nurse flashed a nervous smile in his direction. “i’m sorry, mr. katagiri, but you haven’t been
shot.”
“i haven’t? are you sure?” 
“as sure as i am that there was no earthquake this morning.”
katagiri was stunned. “then what the hell am i doing in a hospital?”
“somebody found you lying in the street, unconscious. in the kabukicho neighborhood of
shinjuku. you didn’t have any external wounds. you were just out cold. and we still haven’t
figured out why. the doctor’s going

lying in the street unconscious? katagiri was sure he had seen the pistol go off, aimed at him. he
took a deep breath and tried to get his head straight. he would start by putting all the facts in order.
“what you’re telling me is, i’ve been lying in this hospital bed, unconscious, since early evening
yesterday, is that right?”
“right,” the nurse said. “and you had a really bad night, mr. katagiri. you must have had some
awful nightmares. i heard you yelling, ‘frog! hey, frog!’ you did it a lot. you have a friend
nicknamed frog?”
katagiri closed his eyes and listened to the slow, rhythmic beating of his heart as it ticked off the
minutes of his life. how much of what he remembered had actually happened and how much was
hallucination? did frog really exist, and had frog fought with worm to put a stop to the
earthquake? or had tha

s. they climbed up the lamp and blocked the light,
and, of course, they crept onto katagiri’s bed. hundreds of them came burrowing under the covers.
they crawled up his legs, under his bed gown, between his thighs. the smallest worms and maggots
crawled inside his anus and ears and nostrils. centipedes pried open his mouth and crawled inside,
one after another. filled with an intense despair, katagiri screamed.
someone snapped a switch and light filled the room.
“mr. katagiri!” called the nurse. katagiri opened his eyes to the light. his body was soaked in
sweat. the bugs were gone. all they had left behind in him was a horrible, slimy sensation.
“another bad dream, eh? poor dear.” with quick, efficient movements, the nurse readied an
injection and stabbed the needle into his arm.
he took a long, deep breath and let it out. his heart was expanding and contracting violently.
“what were you dreaming about?”
katagiri was having trouble differentiating dream from reality. “what

you see with your eyes is not
necessarily real,” he told himself aloud.
“that’s so true,” the nurse said with a smile. “especially where those dreams are concerned.”
“frog,” he murmured.
“did something happen to frog?” she asked.
“he saved tokyo from being destroyed by an earthquake. all by himself.”
“that’s nice,” the nurse said, replacing his near-empty intravenous-feeding bottle with a new one.
“we don’t need any more awful things happening in tokyo. we have plenty already.”
“but it cost him his life. he’s gone. i think he went back to the murk. he’ll never come here
again.”
smiling, the nurse toweled the sweat from his forehead. “you were very fond of frog, weren’t you,
katagiri?”
“locomotive,” katagiri mumbled. “more than anybody.” then he closed his eyes and sank into a
restful, dr
