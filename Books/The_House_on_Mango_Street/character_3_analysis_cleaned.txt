[CHARACTER]
as the younger sister, [CHARACTER] is often esperanza's responsibility,
and though her innocence is a major source of annoyance for esperanza, it
also signals [CHARACTER]'s independence. in many ways, [CHARACTER] is a pesky
little sister. esperanza must introduce [CHARACTER] to her new friends
and keep her away from bad influences, such as the vargas kids.
[CHARACTER] also has qualities that esperanza covets, including two names
("[CHARACTER]" is short for "magdalena"), pretty eyes, and shiny, straight
hair. though [CHARACTER] can be a nuisance and a tag-a-long, and her actions
often embarrass and annoy esperanza, she frequently demonstrates
her independence. when esperanza, rachel, and lucy make up chants
about hips, [CHARACTER] recites old chants that everyone already knows.
similarly, when rachel and lucy describe clouds with creative metaphors,
[CHARACTER] gives the clouds everyday names such as jose and alicia. [CHARACTER]'s
apparent refusal to be creative embarrasses esperanza, but her choices
suggest she has her own way of surviving on mango street. 
[CHARACTER] and esperanza don't seem very much alike, but their
differences in age and sociability mask their fundamental similarities. [CHARACTER]
and esperanza laugh at the same things, even those things others
don't understand are funny. more important, [CHARACTER] and esperanza
are both dreamers. while esperanza imagines a world outside the
barrio, [CHARACTER] turns the outside world into the barrio by giving
the clouds the same names as her neighbors. by doing so, she enlarges
her world and makes it bearable. she turns mango street into the
center of the universe, a place where she can be happy. [CHARACTER] and
esperanza are also very steadfast in their ideas, though [CHARACTER] is
less likely to go along with the other girls if her views differ. while
esperanza, lucy, and rachel bounce ideas off each other, [CHARACTER] pursues
her own idea. she is not distracted from her dreams, even when the
other girls give her dirty looks. despite [CHARACTER]'s similarities to
esperanza, [CHARACTER] does not have as much a part in esperanza's narrative
as other women. esperanza observes most of the women in her life
closely and gives each of them a chapter--except for [CHARACTER]. [CHARACTER]
ultimately recedes from view as esperanza pursues life beyond mango
street.
