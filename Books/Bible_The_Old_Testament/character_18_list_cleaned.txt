[CHARACTER] - 
the opposing kings who divide israel into the northern
kingdom of israel and the southern kingdom of judah. rehoboam and
jeroboam introduce rampant worship of idols and false gods into their
kingdoms. each king acts both as a point of contrast and a double,
or mirror, for the other, allowing the biblical reader to trace
the rapid growth of evil in israel's two kingdoms.
