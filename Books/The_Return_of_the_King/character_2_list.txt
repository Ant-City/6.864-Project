Gandalf the White - 
 The great wizard, also known as Mithrandir, who
leads the forces of the West. Gandalf, resurrected from his seeming
death in The Fellowship of the Ring, functions
as a soldier and a mystic, but more often as an advisor to the political
rulers of the world of Men. While Gandalf possesses supernatural
abilities, his powers of speech remain his greatest tool for admonishing
his counterparts and rebuking his foes.
