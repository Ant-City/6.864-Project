 trees leads away from the audience toward a lake which lies lost in the depths of the park. the avenue is obstructed by a rough stage, temporarily erected for the performance of amateur theatricals, and which screens the lake from view. there is a dense growth of bushes to the left and right of the stage. a few chairs and a little table are placed in front of the stage. the sun has just set. jacob and some other workmen are heard hammering and coughing on the stage behind the lowered curtain.

masha and medviedenko come in from the left, returning from a walk.

medviedenko. why do you always wear mourning?

masha. i dress in black to match my life. i am unhappy.

medviedenko. why should you be unhappy? [thinking it over] i don‚Äôt understand it. you are healthy, and though your father is not rich, he has a good competency. my life is far harder than yours. i only have twenty-three roubles a month to live on, but i don‚Äôt wear mourning. [they sit down].

masha. happiness does not depend on

 riches; poor men are often happy.

medviedenko. in theory, yes, but not in reality. take my case, for instance; my mother, my two sisters, my little brother and i must all live somehow on my salary of twenty-three roubles a month. we have to eat and drink, i take it. you wouldn‚Äôt have us go without tea and sugar, would you? or tobacco? answer me that, if you can.

masha. [looking in the direction of the stage] the play will soon begin.

medviedenko. yes, nina zarietchnaya is going to act in treplieff‚Äôs play. they love one another, and their two souls will unite to-night in the effort to interpret the same idea by different means. there is no ground on which your soul and mine can meet. i love you. too restless and sad to stay at home, i tramp here every day, six miles and back, to be met only by your indifference. i am poor, my family is large, you can have

no inducement to marry a man who cannot even find sufficient food for his own mouth.

masha. it is not that. [she takes snuff] i am touched by your affection, but i cannot return it, that is all. [she offers him the snuff-box] will you take some?

medviedenko. no, thank you. [a pause.]

masha. the air is sultry; a storm is brewing for to-night. you do nothing but moralise or else talk about money. to you, poverty is the greatest misfortune that can befall a man, but i think it is a thousand times easier to go begging in rags than to‚Äîyou wouldn‚Äôt understand that, though.

sorin leaning on a cane, and treplieff come in.

sorin. for some reason, my boy, country life doesn‚Äôt suit me, and i am sure i shall never get used to it. last night i went to bed at ten and woke at nine this

treplieff. there is no doubt that you should live in town. [he catches sight of masha and medviedenko] you shall be called when the play begins, my friends, but you must not stay here now. go away, please.

sorin. miss masha, will you kindly ask your father to leave the dog unchained? it howled so last night that my sister was unable to sleep.

masha. you must speak to my father yourself. please excuse me; i can‚Äôt do so. [to medviedenko] come, let us go.

medviedenko. you will let us know when the play begins?

masha and medviedenko go out.

sorin. i foresee that that dog is going to howl all night again. it is always this way in the country; i have never been able to live as i like here. i come down for a month‚

paulina. [seizes his hand] dearest!

dorn. be quiet! here they come.

arkadina comes in on sorin‚Äôs arm; also trigorin, shamraeff, medviedenko, and masha.

shamraeff. she acted most beautifully at the poltava fair in 1873; she was really magnificent. but tell me, too, where tchadin the comedian is now? he was inimitable as rasplueff, better than sadofski. where is he now?

arkadina. don‚Äôt ask me where all those antediluvians are! i know nothing about them. [she sits down.]

masha. shall i go and find him?

arkadina. if you please, my dear.

masha. [goes off to the left, calling] mr. constantine! oh, mr. constantine!

nina. [comes in from behind the stage] i see that the play will never be finished, so now i can go home. good evening. [she kisses arkadina and paulina.]

medviedenko. what salary does the church pay its singers? [all go out except dorn.]

dorn. i may have lost my judgment and my wits, but i must confess i liked that play. there was something in it. when the girl spoke of her solitude and the devil‚Äôs eyes gleamed across the lake, i felt my hands shaking with excitement. it was so fresh and naive. but here he comes; let me say something pleasant to him.

treplieff comes in.

treplieff. all gone already?

dorn. i am here.

treplieff. masha has been yelling for me all over the park. an insufferable creature.

dorn. constantine, your play delighted me. it was strange, of course, and i did not hear the end, but it made a deep impression on me. you have a great deal of talent, and must persevere in your work.

treplieff seizes his hand and squeezes it hard, then kisses him impetuously.

dorn. tut, tut! how excited you are. your eyes are full of tears. listen to me. you chose your subject in the realm of abstract thought, and you did

dorn. she has gone home.

treplieff. [in despair] gone home? what shall i do? i want to see her; i must see her! i shall follow her.

dorn. my dear boy, keep quiet.

treplieff. i am going. i must go.

masha comes in.

masha. your mother wants you to come in, mr. constantine. she is waiting for you, and is very uneasy.

treplieff. tell her i have gone away. and for heaven‚Äôs sake, all of you, leave me alone! go away! don‚Äôt follow me about!

dorn. come, come, old chap, don‚Äôt act like this; it isn‚Äôt kind at all.

treplieff. [through his tears] good-bye, doctor, and thank you.

treplieff goes out.

masha. wait a moment.

dorn. what do you want?

masha. let me tell you again. i feel like talking. [she grows more and more excited] i do not love my father, but my heart turns to you. for some reason, i feel with all my soul that you are near to me. help me! help me, or i shall do something foolish and mock at my life, and ruin it. i am at the end of my strength.

dorn. what is the matter? how can i help you?

the lawn in front of sorin‚Äôs house. the house stands in the background, on a broad terrace. the lake, brightly reflecting the rays of the sun, lies to the left. there are flower-beds here and there. it is noon; the day is hot. arkadina, dorn, and masha are sitting on a bench on the lawn, in the shade of an old linden. an open book is lying on dorn‚Äôs knees.

arkadina. [to masha] come, get up. [they both get up] stand beside me. you are twenty-two and i am almost twice your age. tell me, doctor, which of us is the younger looking?

dorn. you are, of course.

nina. what are you reading?

arkadina. ‚Äúon the water,‚Äù by maupassant. [she reads a few lines to herself] but the rest is neither true nor interesting. [she lays down the book] i am uneasy about my son. tell me, what is the matter with him? why is he so dull and depressed lately? he spends all his days on the lake, and i scarcely ever see him any more.

masha. his heart is heavy. [timidly, to nina] please recite something from his play.

nina. [shrugging her shoulders] shall i? is it so interesting?

masha. [with suppressed rapture] when he recites, his eyes shine and his face grows pale. his voice is beautiful and sad, and he has the ways of a poet.

sorin begins to snore.

dorn. pleasant dreams!

dorn. one must take life seriously, and to take a cure at sixty-five and regret that one did not have more pleasure in youth is, forgive my saying so, trifling.

dorn. that is a trifle, your honour.

masha. i am telling you all these things because you write books and they may be useful to you. i tell you honestly, i should not have lived another day if he had wounded himself fatally. yet i am courageous; i have decided to tear this love of mine out of my heart by the roots.

trigorin. how will you do it?

trigorin. the school-teacher?

masha. yes.

trigorin. i don‚Äôt see the necessity for that.

masha. fiddlesticks! [she fills a glass] don‚Äôt look at me with that expression on your face. women drink oftener than you imagine, but most of them do it in secret, and not openly, as i do. they do indeed, and it is always either vodka or brandy. [they touch glasses] to your good health! you are so easy to get on with that i am sorry to see you go. [they drink.]

trigorin. and i am sorry to leave.

masha. you should ask her to stay.

trigorin. she would not do that now. her son has been behaving ou

masha. it is jealousy. however, that is none of my business. [a pause. jacob walks through the room carrying a trunk; nina comes in and stands by the window] that schoolteacher of mine is none too clever, but he is very good, poor man, and he loves me dearly, and i am sorry for him. however, let me say good-bye and wish you a pleasant journey. remember me kindly in your thoughts.

masha. [calling treplieff] mr. constantine, where are you? [looking about her] there is no one here. his old uncle is forever asking for constantine, and can‚Äôt live without him for an instant.

medviedenko. he dreads being left alone. [listening to the wind] this is a wild night. we have had this storm for two days.

masha. [shaking her head] i shall spend the night here.

medviedenko. [imploringly] do come, masha. the baby must be hungry.

masha. nonsense, matriona will feed it. [a pause.]

medviedenko. it is a pity to leave him three nights without his mother.

masha. you are getting too tiresome. you used sometimes to talk of other things besides home and the baby, home and the baby. that is all i ever hear from you now.

medviedenko. come home, masha.

masha. you can go home if you want to.

medviedenko. your father won‚Äôt give me a horse.

masha. yes, he will; ask him.

medviedenko. i think i shall. are you coming home to-morrow?

masha. yes, yes, to-morrow.

she takes snuff. treplieff and paulina come in. treplieff is carrying some pillows and a blanket, and paulina is carrying sheets and pillow cases. they lay them on the divan, and treplieff goes and sits down at his desk.

masha. who is that for, mother?

paulina. mr. sorin asked to sleep in constantine‚Äôs room to-night.

masha. let me make the bed.

she makes the bed. paulina goes up to the desk and looks at the manuscripts lying on it. [a pause.]

treplieff gets up from his desk and goes out without a word.

masha. there now! you have vexed him. i told you not to bother him.

paulina. i am sorry for you, masha.

masha. much i need your pity!

paulina. my heart aches for you. i see how things are, and understand.

masha. you see what doesn‚Äôt exist. hopeless love is only found in novels. it is a trifle; all one has to do is to keep a tight rein on oneself, and keep one‚Äôs head clear. love must be plucked out the moment it springs up in the heart. my husband has been promised a school in another district, and when we have once left this place i shall forget it all. i shall tear my passion out by the

masha. the great thing, mother, is not to have him continually in sight. if my simon could only get his remove i should forget it all in a month or two. it is a trifle.

dorn and medviedenko come in through the door on the left, wheeling sorin in an arm-chair.

medviedenko. i have six mouths to feed now, and flour is at seventy kopecks.

sorin. [laughing] twenty-eight years!

treplieff comes in and sits down on a stool at sorin‚Äôs feet. masha fixes her eyes on his face and never once tears them away.

dorn. we are keeping constantine from his work.

treplieff. in the village, at the inn. she has been there for five days. i should have gone to see her, but masha here went, and she refuses to see any one. some one told me she had been seen wandering in the fields a mile from here yesterday evening.

medviedenko. yes, i saw her. she was walking away from here in the direction of the village. i asked her why she had not been to see us. she said she would come.

trigorin. did you marry him?

masha. long ago.

shamraeff, masha, and dorn sit down at the card-table.

arkadina. they want to attract attention to him.

trigorin. he doesn‚Äôt seem able to make a success, he can‚Äôt somehow strike the right note. there is an odd vagueness about his writings that sometimes verges on delirium. he has never created a single living character.
