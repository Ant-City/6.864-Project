might have forgotten everything we ever knew. that's a thought, isn't it? (he laughs generously.) we'd be back
where we started - improvising.
 ros: tumblers, are you?
 player: we can give you a tumble if that's your taste and times being what they are... otherwise, for a jingle
of coin we can do you a selection of gory romances, full of fine cadence and corpses, pirated from italian;
and it doesn't take much to make a jingle - even a single coin has music in it.

 ros: i thought we were gentlemen.

us say, being as there are so many of us, the same side of two coins. (bows again.) don't clap too loudly -
it's a very old world.
 ros: what is your line?
 player: tragedy, sir. deaths and disclosures, universal and particular, denouements both unexpected and
inexorable, transvestite melodrama on all levels including the suggestive. we transport you into the world of
intrigue and illusion...

there are special terms. getting warm, am i?

 guil: how nice.
 player: there's nothing more unconvincing than an, unconvincing death.
 guil: i'm sure.

makes a show of protestation to him. he takes her up, declining his head upon her neck. he lies down. she,
seeing him asleep, leaves him.)
 guil: what is the dumbshow for?
 player: well, it's a device, really - it makes the action that follows more or less comprehensible; you
understand, we are tied down to a language which makes up in obscurity what it lacks in style.

poisoner comes in again, attended by two others (the two in cloaks). the
poisoner seems to console with her. the dead body is carried away. the
poisoner woos the queen with gifts. she seems harsh awhile but in the end
accepts his love. end of mime, at which point, the wail of a woman in
torment and ophelia appears, wailing, closely followed by hamlet in a
hysterical state, shouting

tragedians, who have frozen.) those that are married already (he leans close to the player-queen and
poisoner, speaking with quiet edge) all but one shall live. (he smiles briefly at them without mirth, and starts
to back out, his parting shot rising again.) the rest shall keep as they are. (as he leaves, ophelia tottering
upstage, he speaks into her ear a quick clipped sentence.) to a nunnery, go.

body.
 guil: how am i supposed to take that?
 player: lying down. (he laughs briefly and in a second has never laughed in his life.) there's a design at
work in all art - surely you know that? events must play themselves out to aesthetic, moral and logical
conclusion.
 guil: and what's that, in this case?
 player: it never varies - we aim at the point where everyone who is marked for death dies.
 guil: marked?
 player: between "just desserts" and "tragic irony" we are given quite a lot of scope for our particular talent.
generally speaking, things have gone about as far as they can possibly go when things have got about as bad as
they reasonably get. (he switches on a smile.)

scene, sexual and passionate, between the queen and the poisoner/king.)

queen give rein to their unbridled passion! she little knowing that the man she holds in her arms--!

 guil: no.
 player: a slaughterhouse-eight corpses all told. it brings out the best in us.
 guil (tense, progressively rattled during the whole mime and commentary): you!-what do you know about
death?
 player: it's what the actors do best. they have to exploit whatever talent is given to them, and their talent is
dying. they can die heroically, comically, ironically, slowly, suddenly, disgustingly, charmingly, or from a great
height. my own talent is

 player: no, no-they kill beautifully. in fact some of them kill even better than they die. the rest die better than
they kill. they're a team.
 ros: which ones are which?
 player: there's not much in it.
 guil (fear, derision): actors! the mechanics of cheap melodrama! that isn't death! (more quietly.) you scream
and choke and sink to your knees, but it doesn't bring death home to anyone-it doesn't catch them unawares and
start the whisper in their skulls that says-"one day you are going to die." (he straightens up.) you die so many
times; how can you expect them to believe in your death?

spies.)

 guil: no, no, no... you've got it all wrong... you can't act death. the fact of it is nothing to do with seeing it
happen - it's not gasps and blood and falling about - that isn't what makes it death. it's just a man failing

 guil: yes, i'm very fond of boats myself. i like the way they're-contained. you don't have to worry about
which way to go, or whether to go at all-the question doesn't arise, because you're on a boat, aren't you? boats are

my life on boats.
