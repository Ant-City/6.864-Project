Spirit - 
                Spirit
is one aspect of our tripartite soul. It is the source of our honor-loving
and victory-loving desires. Spirit is responsible for our feelings
of anger and indignation. In a just soul, spirit acts as henchman
to reason, ensuring that appetite adheres to reason's commands.
