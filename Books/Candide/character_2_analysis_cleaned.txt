[CHARACTER] 
[CHARACTER] acts as both foil and counterpart to pangloss.
he is more believable than the other major characters in the novel,
not because he is more complex, but because he is more intelligent
and more likely to draw conclusions with which we can identify.
a scholar who has suffered personal and financial setbacks, [CHARACTER]
is as extreme a pessimist as pangloss is an optimist. he even takes
issue with candide's statement that "there is some good" in the
world. direct experience plays a greater part in [CHARACTER]'s estimation
of the world than it does in pangloss's. as a result, he is able
to provide insight into events far beyond pangloss's ability to
do so. [CHARACTER] demonstrates such insight when he predicts that giroflee
and paquette will not be happier for having money and when he analyzes
the psychology of count pococurante.

	though [CHARACTER]'s philosophy is more effective and honest
than pangloss's, it also has some of the same flaws. while [CHARACTER]
is usually good at predicting how people will behave, he fails noticeably with
cacambo. [CHARACTER]'s absolute pessimism dictates that a valet trusted
with millions in gold will certainly betray his master, yet cacambo's
honesty defies that pessimism. voltaire prefers flexible philosophies
based on real evidence to dogmatic assertions based on abstractions.
absolute optimism and absolute pessimism both fall into the latter
category, because they will admit no exceptions. like pangloss,
[CHARACTER] abides by ideas that discourage any active efforts to change
the world for the better. if, as [CHARACTER] asserts, "man [is] bound
to live either in convulsions of misery or in the lethargy of boredom,"
why should anyone try to rescue anyone else from "convulsions of
misery"?
