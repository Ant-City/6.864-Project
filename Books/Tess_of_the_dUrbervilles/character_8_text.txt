mien, as if distressed at duties it had never before been called upon
to perform.  it was with a sudden flush that she read and realized
what was to be the inscription he was now halfway through--


      thou, shalt, not, commit--


her cheerful friend saw her looking, stopped his brush, and shouted--

"if you want to ask for edification on these things of moment,
there's a very earnest good man going to preach a charity-sermon
to-day in the parish you are going to--mr clare of emminster.  i'm
not of his persuasion now, but he's a good man, and he'll expound as
well as any parson i know.  'twas he began the work in me."

but tess did not answer; she throbbingly resumed her walk, her eyes
fixed on the ground.  "pooh--i don't believe god said such things!"
she murmured contemptuously when her flush had died away.

a plume of smoke soared up suddenly from her father's chimney, the
sight of which made her heart ache.  the aspect of the interior, when
she reached it, ma

 they were blooming young women, and, except one, rather
older than herself.  by bedtime tess was thoroughly tired, and fell
asleep immediately.

but one of the girls, who occupied an adjoining bed, was more wakeful
than tess, and would insist upon relating to the latter various
particulars of the homestead into which she had just entered.  the
girl's whispered words mingled with the shades, and, to tess's drowsy
mind, they seemed to be generated by the darkness in which they
floated.

"mr angel clare--he that is learning milking, and that plays
the harp--never says much to us.  he is a pa'son's son, and is
too much taken up wi' his own thoughts to notice girls.  he is
the dairyman's pupil--learning farming in all its branches.  he
has learnt sheep-farming at another place, and he's now mastering
dairy-work....  yes, he is quite the gentleman-born.  his father is
the reverent mr clare at emminster--a good many miles from here."

"oh--i have heard of him," said her companion, now awake.  "a v

earnest clergyman, is he not?"

"yes--that he is--the earnestest man in all wessex, they say--the
last of the old low church sort, they tell me--for all about here be
what they call high.  all his sons, except our mr clare, be made
pa'sons too."

tess had not at this hour the curiosity to ask why the present mr
clare was not made a parson like his brethren, and gradually fell
asleep again, the words of her informant coming to her along with the
smell of the cheeses in the adjoining cheeseloft, and the measured
dripping of the whey from the wrings downstairs.

s father, a poor parson at the other end
of the county, and had arrived at talbothays dairy as a six months'
pupil, after going the round of some other farms, his object being
to acquire a practical skill in the various processes of farming,
with a view either to the colonies or the tenure of a home-farm, as
circumstances might decide.

his entry into the ranks of the agriculturists and breeders was a
step in the young man's career which had been anticipated neither
by himself nor by others.

mr clare the elder, whose first wife had died and left him a
daughter, married a second late in life.  this lady had somewhat
unexpectedly brought him three sons, so that between angel, the
youngest, and his father the vicar there seemed to be almost a
missing generation.  of these boys the aforesaid angel, the child of
his old age, was the only son who had not taken a university degree,
though he was the single one of them whose early promise might have
done full justice to an academical training.

e two or three years before angel's appearance at the marlott
dance, on a day when he had left school and was pursuing his studies
at home, a parcel came to the vicarage from the local bookseller's,
directed to the reverend james clare.  the vicar having opened it and
found it to contain a book, read a few pages; whereupon he jumped up
from his seat and went straight to the shop with the book under his
arm.

"why has this been sent to my house?" he asked peremptorily, holding
up the volume.

"it was ordered, sir."

"not by me, or any one belonging to me, i am happy to say."

the shopkeeper looked into his order-book.

"oh, it has been misdirected, sir," he said.  "it was ordered by mr
angel clare, and should have been sent to

 him."

mr clare winced as if he had been struck.  he went home pale and
dejected, and called angel into his study.

"look into this book, my boy," he said.  "what do you know about it?"

"i ordered it," said angel simply.

"what for?"

"to read."

"how can you think of reading it?"

"how can i?  why--it is a system of philosophy.  there is no more
moral, or even religious, work published."

"yes--moral enough; i don't deny that.  but religious!--and for you,
who intend to be a minister of the gospel!"

years; and having an acquaintance who was starting on a thriving life
as a colonial farmer, it occurred to angel that this might be a lead
in the right direction.  farming, either in the colonies, america, or
at home--farming, at any rate, after becoming well qualified for the
business by a careful apprenticeship--that was a vocation which would
probably afford an independence without the sacrifice of what he
valued even more than a competency--intellectual liberty.

so we find angel clare at six-and-twenty here at talbothays as a
student of kine, and, as there were no houses near at hand in which
he could get a comfortable lodging, a boarder at the dairyman's.

his room was an immense attic which ran the whole length of the
dairy-house.  it could only be reached by a ladder from the
cheese-loft, and had been closed up for a long time till he arrived
and selected it as his retreat.  here clare had plenty of space, and
could often be heard by the dairy-folk pacing up and down when

ove entirely, reading a good deal, and
strumming upon an old harp which he had bought at a sale, saying when
in a bitter humour that he might have to get his living by it in the
streets some day.  but he soon preferred to read human nature by
taking his meals downstairs in the general dining-kitchen, with the
dairyman and his wife, and the maids and men, who all together formed
a lively assembly; for though but few milking hands slept in the
house, several joined the family at meals.  the longer clare resided
here the less objection had he to his company, and the more did he
like to share quarters with them in common.

much to his surprise he took, indeed, a real delight in their
companionship.  the conventional farm-folk of his imagination--
personified in the newspaper-press by the pitiable dummy known as
hodge--were obliterated after a few days' residence.  at close
quarters no hodge was to be seen.  at first, it is true, when clare's
intelligence was fresh from a contrasting society, the

nity.  secondarily, he made close acquaintance with phenomena
which he had before known but darkly--the seasons in their moods,
morning and evening, night and noon, winds in their different
tempers, trees, waters and mists, shades and silences, and the voices
of inanimate things.


the early mornings were still sufficiently cool to render a fire
acceptable in the large room wherein they breakfasted; and, by
mrs crick's orders, who held that he was too genteel to mess at
their table, it was angel clare's custom to sit in the yawning
chimney-corner during the meal, his cup-and-saucer and plate being
placed on a hinged flap at his elbow.  the light from the long, wide,
mullioned window opposite shone in upon his nook, and, assisted by a
secondary light of cold blue quality which shone down the chimney,
enabled him to read there easily whenever disposed to do so.  between
clare and the window was the table at which his companions sat, their
munching profiles rising sharp against the panes; while

 to the side
was the milk-house door, through which were visible the rectangular
leads in rows, full to the brim with the morning's milk.  at the
further end the great churn could be seen revolving, and its
slip-slopping heard--the moving power being discernible through the
window in the form of a spiritless horse walking in a circle and
driven by a boy.

for several days after tess's arrival clare, sitting abstractedly
reading from some book, periodical, or piece of music just come by
post, hardly noticed that she was present at table.  she talked so
little, and the other maids talked so much, that the babble did not
strike him as possessing a new note, and he was ever in the habit
of neglecting the particulars of an outward scene for the general
impression.  one day, however, when he had been conning one of his
music-scores, and by force of imagination was hearing the tune in
his head,

the general attention being drawn to her, including that of the
dairyman's pupil, tess flushed, and remarking evasively that it was
only a fancy, resumed her breakfast.

clare continued to observe her.  she soon finished her eating, and
having a consciousness that clare was regarding her, began to trace
imaginary patterns on the tablecloth with her forefinger with the
constraint of a domestic animal that perceives itself to be watched.

"what a fresh and virginal daughter of nature that milkmaid is!" he
said to himself.

and then he seemed to discern in her something that was familiar,
something which carried him back into a joyous and unforeseeing past,
before the necessity of taking thought had made the heavens gray.  he
concluded that he had beheld her befo

but she soon found a curious correspondence between the ostensibly
chance position of the cows and her wishes in this matter, till she
felt that their order could not be the result of accident.  the
dairyman's pupil had lent a hand in getting the cows together of
late, and at the fifth or sixth time she turned her eyes, as she
rested against the cow, full of sly inquiry upon him.

"mr clare, you have ranged the cows!" she said, blushing; and in
making the accusation, symptoms of a smile gently lifted her upper
lip in spite of her, so as to show the tips of her teeth, the lower
lip remaining severely still.

"well, it makes no difference," said he.  "you will always be here to
milk them."

"do you think so?  i hope i shall!  but i don't know."

she was angry with herself afterwards, thinking that he, unaware of
her grave reasons for liking this seclusion, might have mistaken her

oming weeds emitting offensive smells--weeds whose red and yellow
and purple hues formed a polychrome as dazzling as that of cultivated
flowers.  she went stealthily as a cat through this profusion of
growth, gathering cuckoo-spittle on her skirts, cracking snails that
were underfoot, staining her hands with thistle-milk and slug-slime,
and rubbing off upon her naked arms sticky blights which, though
snow-white on the apple-tree trunks, made madder stains on her skin;
thus she drew quite near to clare, still unobserved of him.

tess was conscious of neither time nor space.  the exaltation which
she had described as being producible at will by gazing at a star
came now without any determination of hers; she undulated upon the
thin notes of the second-hand harp, and their harmonies passed like
breezes through her, bringing tears into her eyes.  the floating
pollen seemed to be his notes made visible, and the dampness of
the garden the weeping of the garden's sensibility.  though near

thus, neither having the clue to the other's secret, they were
respectively puzzled at what each revealed, and awaited new knowledge
of each other's character and mood without attempting to pry into
each other's history.


every day, every hour, brought to him one more little stroke of
her nature, and to her one more of his.  tess was trying to lead a
repressed life, but she little divined the strength of her own
vitality.

at first tess seemed to regard angel clare as an intelligence rather
than as a man.  as such she compared him with herself; and at every
discovery of the abundance of his illuminations, of the distance
between her own modest mental standpoint and the unmeasurable, andean
altitude of his, she became quite dejected, disheartened from all
further effort on her own part whatever.

he observed her dejection one day, when he had casually mentioned
something to her about pastoral life in ancient greece.  she was
gathering the buds called "lord

the unjust alike," she answered, with a slight quaver in her voice.
"but that's what books will not tell me."

"tess, fie for such bitterness!"  of course he spoke with a
conventional sense of duty only, for that sort of wondering had not
been unknown to himself in bygone days.  and as he looked at the
unpracticed mouth and lips, he thought that such a daughter of the
soil could only have caught up the sentiment by rote.  she went on
peeling the lords and ladies till clare, regarding for a moment the
wave-like curl of her lashes as they dropped with her bent gaze on
her soft cheek, lingeringly went away.  when he was gone she stood
awhile, thoughtfully peeling the last bud; and then, awakening
from her reverie, flung it and all the crowd of floral nobility
impatiently on the ground, in an ebullition of displeasure with
herself for her _niaiserie_, and with a quickening warmth in her
heart of hearts.

forget, so unpleasant had been its issues--the identity of her family
with that of the knightly d'urbervilles.  barren attribute as it was,
disastrous as its discovery had been in many ways to her, perhaps
mr clare, as a gentleman and a student of history, would respect
her sufficiently to forget her childish conduct with the lords and
ladies if he knew that those purbeck-marble and alabaster people in
kingsbere church really represented her own lineal forefathers; that
she was no spurious d'urberville, compounded of money and ambition
like those at trantridge, but true d'urberville to the bone.

asking the former if mr clare had any great respect for old county
families when they had lost all their money and land.

"mr clare," said the dairyman emphatically, "is one of the most
rebellest rozums you ever knowed--not a bit like the rest of his
family; and if there's one thing that he do hate more than another
'tis the notion of what's called a' old family.  he says that it
stands to reason that old families have done their spurt of work in
past days, and can't have anything left in 'em now.  there's the

paridelles--the old family that used to own lots o' the lands out by
king's hintock, now owned by the earl o' wessex, afore even he or
his was heard of.  well, mr clare found this out, and spoke quite
scornful to the poor girl for days.  'ah!' he says to her, 'you'll
never make a good dairymaid!  all your skill was used up ages ago
in palestine, and you must lie fallow for a thousand years to git
strength for more deeds!'  a boy came here t'other day asking for
a job, and said his name was matt, and when we asked him his surname
he said he'd never heard that 'a had any surname, and when we asked
why, he said he supposed his folks hadn't been 'stablished long

nough.  'ah! you're the very boy i want!' says mr clare, jumping
up and shaking hands wi'en; 'i've great hopes of you;' and gave him
half-a-crown.  o no! he can't stomach old families!"

after hearing this caricature of clare's opinion poor tess was glad
that she had not said a word in a weak moment about her family--even
though it was so unusually old almost to have gone round the circle
and become a new one.  besides, another diary-girl was as good as
she, it seemed, in that respect.  she held her tongue about the
d'urberville vault and the knight of the conqueror whose name she
bore.  the insight afforded into clare's character suggested to her
that it was largely owing to her supposed untraditional newness that

dairyman crick's household of maids and men lived on comfortably,
placidly, even merrily.  their position was perhaps the happiest of
all positions in the social scale, being above the line at which
neediness ends, and below the line at which the _convenances_ begin
to cramp natural feelings, and the stress of threadbare modishness
makes too little of enough.

thus passed the leafy time when arborescence seems to be the one
thing aimed at out of doors.  tess and clare unconsciously studied
each other, ever balanced on the edge of a passion, yet apparently
keeping out of it.  all the while they were converging, under an
irresistible law, as surely as two streams in one vale.

tess had never in her recent life been so happy as she was now,
possibly never would be so happy again.  she was, for one thing,
physically and mentally suited among these new surroundings.  the
sapling which had rooted down to a poisonous stratum on the spot of
its sowing had been trans

planted to a deeper soil.  moreover she, and
clare also, stood as yet on the debatable land between predilection
and love; where no profundities have been reached; no reflections
have set in, awkwardly inquiring, "whither does this new current tend
to carry me?  what does it mean to my future?  how does it stand
towards my past?"

tess was the merest stray phenomenon to angel clare as yet--a rosy,
warming apparition which had only just acquired the attribute of
persistence in his consciousness.  so he allowed his mind to be
occupied with her, deeming his preoccupation to be no more than a
philosopher's regard of an exceedingly novel, fresh, and interesting
specimen of womankind.

or other of them to wake the rest, the first
being aroused by an alarm-clock; and, as tess was the latest arrival,
and they soon discovered that she could be depended upon not to sleep
though the alarm as others did, this task was thrust most frequently
upon her.  no sooner had the hour of three struck and whizzed,
than she left her room and ran to the dairyman's door; then up the
ladder to angel's, calling him in a loud whisper; then woke her
fellow-milkmaids.  by the time that tess was dressed clare was
downstairs and out in the humid air.  the remaining maids and the
dairyman usually gave themselves another turn on the pillow, and did
not appear till a quarter of an hour later.

ften--possibly not always by chance--the first two persons
to get up at the dairy-house, they seemed to themselves the first
persons up of all the world.  in these early days of her residence
here tess did not skim, but went out of doors at once after rising,
where he was generally awaiting her.  the spectral, half-compounded,
aqueous light which pervaded the open mead impressed them with
a feeling of isolation, as if they were adam and eve.  at this
dim inceptive stage of the day tess seemed to clare to exhibit a
dignified largeness both of disposition and physique, an almost
regnant power, possibly because he knew that at that preternatural
time hardly any woman so well endowed in person as she was likely to
be walking in the open air within the boundaries of his horizon; very
few in all england.  fair women are usually asleep at mid-summer
dawns.  she was close at hand, and the rest were nowhere.

about this time they would hear dairyman crick's voice, lecturing the
non-resident milkers for arriving late, and speaking sharply to old
deborah fyander for not washing her hands.

"for heaven's sake, pop thy hands under the pump, deb!  upon my soul,
if the london folk only knowed of thee and thy slovenly ways, they'd
swaller their milk and butter more mincing than they do a'ready; and
that's saying a good deal."

the milking progressed, till towards the end tess and clare, in
common with the rest, could hear the heavy breakfast table dragged
out from the wall in the kitchen by mrs crick, this being the
invariable preliminary to each meal; the same horrible scrape
accompanying its return journey when the table had been cleared.

churn revolved as usual, but the butter would not come.  whenever
this happened the dairy was paralyzed.  squish, squash echoed the

for.

dairyman crick and his wife, the milkmaids tess, marian, retty
priddle, izz huett, and the married ones from the cottages; also
mr clare, jonathan kail, old deborah, and the rest, stood gazing
hopelessly at the churn; and the boy who kept the horse going outside
put on moon-like eyes to show his sense of the situation.  even the
melancholy horse himself seemed to look in at the window in inquiring
despair at each walk round.

"'tis years since i went to conjuror trendle's son in egdon--years!"
said the dairyman bitterly.  "and he was nothing to what his father
had been.  i have said fifty times, if i have said once, that i don't

even mr clare began to feel tragical at the dairyman's desperation.

"conjuror fall, t'other side of casterbridge, that they used to call
'wide-o', was a very good man when i was a boy," said jonathan kail.
"but he's rotten as touchwood by now."

"my grandfather used to go to conjuror mynterne, out at owlscombe,
and a clever man a' were, so i've heard grandf'er say," continued mr
crick.  "but there's no such genuine folk about nowadays!"

mrs crick's mind kept nearer to the matter in hand.

"perhaps somebody

 in the house is in love," she said tentatively.
"i've heard tell in my younger days that that will cause it.  why,
crick--that maid we had years ago, do ye mind, and how the butter
didn't come then--"

"ah yes, yes!--but that isn't the rights o't.  it had nothing to do
with the love-making.  i can mind all about it--'twas the damage to
the churn."

he turned to clare.

"jack dollop, a 'hore's-bird of a fellow we had here as milker at one
time, sir, courted a young woman over at mellstock, and deceived her
as he had deceived many afore.  but he had another sort o' woman to
reckon wi' this time, and it was not the girl herself.  one holy
thursday of all days in the almanack, we was here as we mid be now,
only there was no churning in hand, when we zid the girl's mother

kissed the shade of his mouth; i zid her, though he didn't."

"o izz huett!" said marian.

a rosy spot came into the middle of izz huett's cheek.

"well, there was no harm in it," she declared, with attempted
coolness.  "and if i be in love wi'en, so is retty, too; and so be
you, marian, come to that."

marian's full face could not blush past its chronic pinkness.

"i!" she said.  "what a tale!  ah, there he is again!  dear
eyes--dear face--dear mr clare!"

"there--you've owned it!"

"so have you--so have we all," said marian, with the dry frankness of
complete indifference to opinion.  "it is silly to pretend otherwise
amongst ourselves, though we need not own it to other folks.  i would
just marry 'n to-morrow!"

"so would i--and more," murmured izz huett.

"and i too," whispered the more timid retty.

the listener grew warm.

"we can't all marry him," said izz.

"we shan't, either of us; which is worse still," said the eldest.
"there he is a

one sighed, and another sighed, and marian's plump figure sighed
biggest of all.  somebody in bed hard by sighed too.  tears came into
the eyes of retty priddle, the pretty red-haired youngest--the last
bud of the paridelles, so important in the county annals.  they
watched silently a little longer, their three faces still close
together as before, and the triple hues of their hair mingling.  but
the unconscious mr clare had gone indoors, and they saw him no more;
and, the shades beginning to deepen, they crept into their beds.
in a few minutes they heard him ascend the ladder to his own room.
marian was soon snoring, but izz did not drop into forgetfulness for
a long time.  retty priddle cried herself to sleep.

conversation was another of the bitter pills she had been obliged to
swallow that day.  scarce the least feeling of jealousy arose

rdinary care was necessary for holding her own in angel
clare's heart against these her candid friends.  but the grave
question was, ought she to do this?  there was, to be sure, hardly a
ghost of a chance for either of them, in a serious sense; but there
was, or had been, a chance of one or the other inspiring him with a
passing fancy for her, and enjoying the pleasure of his attentions
while he stayed here.  such unequal attachments had led to marriage;
and she had heard from mrs crick that mr clare had one day asked, in
a laughing way, what would be the use of his marrying a fine lady,
and all the while ten thousand acres of colonial pasture to feed,
and cattle to rear, and corn to reap.  a farm-woman would be the
only sensible kind of wife for him.  but whether mr clare had spoken
seriously or not, why should she, who could never conscientiously
allow any man to marry her now, and who had religiously determined
that she never would be tempted to do so, draw off mr clare's
attention from

they came downstairs yawning next morning; but skimming and milking
were proceeded with as usual, and they went indoors to breakfast.
dairyman crick was discovered stamping about the house.  he had
received a letter, in which a customer had complained that the butter
had a twang.

"and begad, so 't have!" said the dairyman, who held in his left hand
a wooden slice on which a lump of butter was stuck. "yes--taste for
yourself!"

several of them gathered round him; and mr clare tasted, tess tasted,
also the other indoor milkmaids, one or two of the milking-men, and
last of all mrs crick, who came out from the waiting breakfast-table.
there certainly was a twang.

the dairyman, who had thrown himself into abstraction to better
realize the taste, and so divine the particular species of noxious
weed to which it appertained, suddenly exclaimed--

"'tis garlic! and i thought there wasn't a blade left in that mead!"

then all the old hands remembered that a certain dry mead

"we must overhaul that mead," he resumed; "this mustn't continny!"

all having armed themselves with old pointed knives, they went out
together.  as the inimical plant could only be present in very
microscopic dimensions to have escaped ordinary observation, to
find it seemed rather a hopeless attempt in the stretch of rich
grass before them.  however, they formed themselves into line, all
assisting, owing to the importance of the search; the dairyman at
the upper end with mr clare, who had volunteered to help; then
tess, marian, izz huett, and retty; then bill lewell, jonathan, and
the married dairywomen--beck knibbs, with her wooly black hair and
rolling eyes; and flaxen frances, consumptive from the winter damps
of the water-meads--who lived in their respective cottages.

with eyes fixed upon the ground they crept slowly across a strip of
the field, returning a little further down in such a manner that,

with the rest in everything, glanced up now and then.  it was not,
of course, by accident that he walked next to tess.

"well, how are you?" he murmured.

"very well, thank you, sir," she replied demurely.

as they had been discussing a score of personal matters only
half-an-hour before, the introductory style seemed a little
superfluous.  but they got no further in speech just then.  they
crept and crept, the hem of her petticoat just touch

and his elbow sometimes brushing hers.  at last the dairyman, who
came next, could stand it no longer.

"upon my soul and body, this here stooping do fairly make my back
open and shut!" he exclaimed, straightening himself slowly with an
excruciated look till quite upright.  "and you, maidy tess, you
wasn't well a day or two ago--this will make your head ache finely!
don't do any more, if you feel fainty; leave the rest to finish it."

dairyman crick withdrew, and tess dropped behind.  mr clare also
stepped out of line, and began privateering about for the weed.  when
she found him near her, her very tension at what she had heard the
night before made her the first to speak.

"don't they look pretty?" she said.

"who?"

"izzy huett and retty."

tess had moodily decided that either of these maidens would make a
good farmer's wife, and that she ought to recommend them, and obscure
her own wretched charms.

"pretty?  well, yes--they are pretty girls--fresh looking.  i have
often thought

"they skim better than i."

"do they?"

clare remained observing them--not without their observing him.

"she is colouring up," continued tess heroically.

"who?"

"retty priddle."

"oh!  why it that?"

"because you are looking at her."

self-sacrificing as her mood might be, tess could not well go further
and cry, "marry one of them, if you really do want a dairywoman and
not a lady; and don't think of marrying me!"  she followed dairyman
crick, and had the mournful satisfaction of seeing that clare
remained behind.

from this day she forced herself to take pains to avoid him--never
allowing herself, as formerly, to remain long in his company, even if
their juxtaposition were purely accidental.  she gave the other three
every chance.

tess was woman enough to realize from their avowals to herself that
angel clare had the honour of all the dairymaids in his keeping, and
her perception of his care to avoid compromising the happiness of
either in the least degree bred a tender respect in tess

ill they were past the pool.

"we can't get there anyhow, without walking right through it, or else
going round the turnpike way; and that would make us so very late!"
said retty, pausing hopelessly.

"and i do colour up so hot, walking into church late, and all the
people staring round," said marian, "that i hardly cool down again
till we get into the that-it-may-please-thees."

while they stood clinging to the bank they heard a splashing round
the bend of the road, and presently appeared angel clare, advancing
along the lane towards them through the water.

four hearts gave a big throb simultaneously.

his aspect was probably as un-sabbatarian a one as a dogmatic
parson's son often presented; his attire being his dairy clothes,
long wading boots, a cabbage-leaf inside his hat to keep his head
cool, with a thistle-spud to finish him off.  "he's not going to
church," said marian.

"no--i wish he was!" murmured tess.

the bank.

"here he comes," she murmured, and they could hear that her lips were
dry with emotion.  "and i have to put my arms round his neck and look
into his face as marian did."

"there's nothing in that," said tess quickly.

"there's a time for everything," continued izz, unheeding.  "a time
to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; the first is now
going to be mine."

"fie--it is scripture, izz!"

"yes," said izz, "i've always a' ear at church for pretty verses."

angel clare, to whom three-quarters of this performance was a
commonplace act of kindness, now approached izz.  she quietly and
dreamily lowered herself into his arms, and angel methodically
marched off with her.  when he was heard returning for the third time
retty's throbbing heart could be almost seen to shake her.  he went
up to the red-haired girl, and while he was seizing her he glanced at
tess.  his lips could not have pronounced more plainly, "it will soon
be you and i."  her comprehension appeared

help it.  there was an understanding between them.

poor little retty, though by far the lightest weight, was the most
troublesome of clare's burdens.  marian had been like a sack of meal,
a dead weight of plumpness under which he has literally staggered.
izz had ridden sensibly and calmly.  retty was a bunch of hysterics.

however, he got through with the disquieted creature, deposited her,
and returned.  tess could see over the hedge the distant three in a
group, standing as he had placed them on the next rising ground.  it
was now her turn.  she was embarrassed to discover that excitement at
the proximity of mr clare's breath an

d eyes, which she had contemned
in her companions, was intensified in herself; and as if fearful of
betraying her secret, she paltered with him at the last moment.

"i may be able to clim' along the bank perhaps--i can clim' better
than they.  you must be so tired, mr clare!"

"no, no, tess," said he quickly.  and almost before she was aware,
she was seated in his arms and resting against his shoulder.

"three leahs to get one rachel," he whispered.

"they are better women than i," she replied, magnanimously sticking
to her resolve.

"not to me," said angel.

he saw her grow warm at this; and they went some steps in silence.

"i hope i am not too heavy?" she said timidly.

"o no.  you should lift marian!  such a lump.  you are like an
undulating billow warmed by t

"it is very pretty--if i seem like that to you."

"no."

"i did not expect such an event to-day."

"nor i...  the water came up so sudden."

that the rise in the water was what she understood him to refer to,
the state of breathing belied.  clare stood still and inclinced his
face towards hers.

"o tessy!" he exclaimed.

the girl's cheeks burned to the breeze, and she could not look into
his eyes for her emotion.  it reminded angel that he was somewhat
unfairly taking advantage of an accidental position; and he went no
further with it.  no definite words of love had crossed their lips
as yet, and suspension at this point was desirable now. however,
he walked slowly, to make the remainder of the distance as long as
possible; but at last

the gaiety with which they had set out had somehow vanished; and
yet there was no enmity or malice between them.  they were generous
young souls; they had been reared in the lonely country nooks where
fatalism is a strong sentiment, and they did not blame her.  such
supplanting was to be.

tess's heart ached.  there was no concealing from herself the fact
that she loved angel clare, perhaps all the more passionately from
knowing that the others had also lost their hearts to him.  there is
contagion in this sentiment, especially among women.  and yet that
same hungry nature had fought against this, but too feebly, and the
natural result had followed.

"i will never stand in your way, nor in the way of either of you!"
she declared to retty that night in the bedroom (her tears running
down).  "i can't help this, my dear!  i don't think marrying is in

pictured all the details of his being won round to consent, of the
wedding preparations, of the bride's happiness, of her dress and
veil, of her blissful home with him, when oblivion would have fallen
upon themselves as far as he and their love were concerned.  thus
they talked, and ached, and wept till sleep charmed their sorrow
away.

after this disclosure tess nourished no further foolish thought that
there lurked any grave and deliberate import in clare's attentions
to her.  it was a passing summer love of her face, for love's own
temporary sake--nothing more. and the thorny crown of this sad
conception was that she whom he really did prefer in a cursory way
to the rest, she who knew herself to be more impassioned in nature,
cleverer, more beautiful than they, was in the eyes of propriety far
less worthy of him than the homelier ones whom he ignored.

amid the oozing fatness and warm ferments of the froom vale, at a
season when the ru

passed over their heads, and the thermidorean weather which came
in its wake seemed an effort on the part of nature to match the state
of hearts at talbothays dairy.  the air of the place, so fresh in the
spring and early summer, was stagnant and enervating now.  its heavy
scents weighed upon them, and at mid-day the landscape seemed lying
in a swoon. ethiopic scorchings browned the upper slopes of the
pastures, but there was still bright green herbage here where the
watercourses purled.  and as clare was oppressed by the outward
heats, so was he burdened inwardly by waxing fervour of passion for
the soft and silent tess.

the rains having passed, the uplands were dry.  the wheels of the
dairyman's spring-cart, as he sped home from market, licked up the
pulverized surface of the highway, and were followed by white ribands
of dust, as if they had set a thin powder-train on fire.  the cows
jumped wildly over the five-barred barton-gate, maddened by the
gad-fly; dairyman crick kept his shirt-sl

in the cows.  during the day the animals obsequiously
followed the shadow of the smallest tree as it moved round the stem
with the diurnal roll; and when the milkers came they could hardly
stand still for the flies.

on one of these afternoons four or five unmilked cows chanced to
stand apart from the general herd, behind the corner of a hedge,
among them being dumpling and old pretty, who loved tess's hands
above those of any other maid.  when she rose from her stool under a
finished cow, angel clare, who had been observing her for some time,
asked her if she would take the aforesaid creatures next.  she
silently assented, and with her stool at arm's length, and the pail
against her knee, went round to where they stood.  soon the sound of
old pretty's milk fizzing into the pail came through the hedge, and
then angel felt inclined to go round the corner also, to finish off a
hard-yielding milcher who had strayed there, he being now as capable
of this as the dairyman himself.

 pail.  but a few--mainly the younger
ones--rested their heads sideways.  this was tess durbeyfield's
habit, her temple pressing the milcher's flank, her eyes fixed on
the far end of the meadow with the quiet of one lost in meditation.
she was milking old pretty thus, and the sun chancing to be on the
milking-side, it shone flat upon her pink-gowned form and her white
curtain-bonnet, and upon her profile, rendering it keen as a cameo
cut from the dun background of the cow.

she did not know that clare had followed her round, and that he sat
under his cow watching her.  the stillness of her head and features
was remarkable: she might have been in a trance, her eyes open, yet
unseeing.  nothing in the picture moved but old pretty's tail and
tess's pink hands, the latter so gently as to be a rhythmic pulsation
only, as if they were obeying a reflex stimulus, like a beating
heart.

how very lovable her face was to him.  yet there was nothing ethereal
about it; all was real vitality, real warmth,

over his flesh, a breeze through his nerves, which well nigh produced
a qualm; and actually produced, by some mysterious physiological
process, a prosaic sneeze.

she then became conscious that he was observing her; but she would
not show it by any change of position, though the curious dream-like
fixity disappeared, and a close eye might easily have discerned that
the rosiness of her face deepened, and then faded till only a tinge
of it was left.

the influence that had passed into clare like an excitation from the
sky did not die down.  resolutions, reticences, prudences, fears,
fell back like a defeated battalion.  he jumped up from his seat,
and, leaving his pail to be kicked over if the milcher had such a
mind, went quickly towards the desire of his eyes, and, kneeling down
beside her, clasped her in his arms.

tess was taken completely by surprise, and she yielded to his embrace
with unreflecting inevitableness.  having seen that it was really her
lover who had advanced, a

old pretty by this time had looked round, puzzled; and seeing two
people crouching under her where, by immemorial custom, there should
have been only one, lifted her hind leg crossly.

"she is angry--she doesn't know what we mean--she'll kick over the
milk!" exclaimed tess, gently striving to free herself, her eyes
concerned with the quadruped's actions, her heart more deeply
concerned with herself and clare.

she slipped up from her seat, and they stood together, his arm still
encircling her.  tess's eyes, fixed on distance, began to fill.

"why do you cry, my darling?" he said.

"o--i don't know!" she murmured.

as she saw and felt more clearly the position she was in she became
agitated and tried to withdraw.

"well, i have betrayed my feeling, tess, at last," said he, with a
curious sigh of desperation, signifying unconsciously that his heart
had outrun his judgement.  "that i--love you dearly

resolve upon a plan for plunging into that world anew.  but behold,
the absorbing scene had been imported hither.  what had been the
engrossing world had dissolved into an uninteresting outer dumb-show;
while here, in this apparently dim and unimpassioned place, novelty
had volcanically started up, as it had never, for him, started up
elsewhere.

every window of the house being open, clare could hear across the
yard each trivial sound of the retiring household.  the dairy-house,
so humble, so insignificant, so purely to him a place of constrained
sojourn that he had never hitherto deemed it of sufficient importance
to be reconnoitred as an object of any quality whatever in the
landscape; what was it now?  the aged and lichened brick gables
breathed forth "stay!"  the windows smiled, the door coaxed and
beckoned, the creeper blushed confederacy.  a personality within

dairy had become to him.  and though new love was to be held
partly responsible for this, it was not solely so.  many besides
angel have learnt that the magnitude of lives is not as to their
external displacements, but as to their subjective experiences.  the
impressionable peasant leads a larger, fuller, more dramatic life
than the pachydermatous king.  looking at it thus, he found that life
was to be seen of the same magnitude here as elsewhere.

despite his heterodoxy, faults, and weaknesses, clare was a man with
a conscience.  tess was no insignificant creature to toy with and
dismiss; but a woman living her precious life--a life which, to
herself who endured or enjoyed it, possessed as great a dimension
as the life of the mightiest to himself.  upon her sensations
the whole world depended to tess; through her existence all her
fellow-creatures existed, to her.  the universe itself only came into
being for tess on the particular day in the particular year in which
she was born.

d after a few additional months spent upon other
farms he would be fully equipped in agricultural knowledge and in
a position to start on his own account.  would not a farmer want a
wife, and should a farmer's wife be a drawing-room wax-figure, or a
woman who understood farming?  notwithstanding the pleasing answer
returned to him by the silence, he resolved to go his journey.

one morning when they sat down to breakfast at talbothays dairy some
maid observed that she had not seen anything of mr clare that day.

"o no," said dairyman crick.  "mr clare has gone hwome to emminster
to spend a few days wi' his kinsfolk."

for four impassioned ones around that table the sunshine of the
morning went out at a stroke, and the birds muffled their song.
but neither girl by word or gesture revealed her blankness.  "he's
getting on towards the end of his time wi' me," added the dairyman,
with a phlegm which unconsciously was brutal; "and so i suppose he
is beginning to see about his plans elsewhere."

"well, i can't mind the exact day without looking at my
memorandum-book," replied crick, with the same intolerable unconcern.
"and even that may be altered a bit.  he'll bide to get a little
practice in the calving out at the straw-yard, for certain.  he'll
hang on till the end of the year i should say."

four months or so of torturing ecstasy in his society--of "pleasure
girdled about with pain".  after that the blackness of unutterable
night.


at this moment of the morning angel clare was riding along a narrow
lane ten miles distant from the breakfasters, in the direction of
his father's vicarage at emminster, carrying, as well as he could,
a little basket which contained some black-puddings and a bottle of
mead, sent by mrs crick, with her kind respects, to his parents.  the
white lane stretched before him, and his eyes were upon it; but they
were staring into next year, and not at the lane.  he loved her;
ought he to marry her?  dared he to marry her?  what would his mothe

hoped she did not, so as to render it unnecessary that he should go
and speak to her, blameless creature that she was.  an overpowering
reluctance to greet her made him decide that she had not seen him.
the young lady was miss mercy chant, the only daughter of his
father's neighbour and friend, whom it was his parents' quiet hope
that he might wed some day.  she was great at antinomianism and
bible-classes, and was plainly going to hold a class now.  clare's
mind flew to the impassioned, summer-steeped heathens in the var
vale, their rosy faces court-patched with cow-droppings; and to one
the most impassioned of them all.

it was on the impulse of the moment that he had resolved to trot
over to emminster, and hence had not written to apprise his mother
and father, aiming, however, to arrive about the breakfast hour,
before they should have gone out to their parish duties.  he was
a little late, and they had already sat down to the morning meal.

everend cuthbert, the
classical scholar, and fellow and dean of his college, down from
cambridge for the long vacation.  his mother appeared in a cap and
silver spectacles, and his father looked what in fact he was--an
earnest, god-fearing man, somewhat gaunt, in years about sixty-five,
his pale face lined with thought and purpose.  over their heads hung
the picture of angel's sister, the eldest of the family, sixteen
years his senior, who had married a missionary and gone out to
africa.

old mr clare was a clergyman of a type which, within the last twenty
years, has well nigh dropped out of contemporary life.  a spiritual
descendant in the direct line from wycliff, huss, luther, calvin; an
evangelical of the evangelicals, a conversionist, a man of apostolic
simplicity in life and thought, he had in his raw youth made up his
mind once for all in the deeper questions of existence, and admitted
no further reasoning on them thenceforward.  he was regarded even by
those of his own date and schoo

aspirations--still unconsciously based on the geocentric view of
things, a zenithal paradise, a nadiral hell--were as foreign to his
own as if they had been the dreams of people on another planet.
latterly he had seen only life, felt only the great passionate pulse
of existence, unwarped, uncontorted, untrammelled by those creeds
which futilely attempt to check what wisdom would be content to
regulate.

on their part they saw a great difference in him, a growing
divergence from the angel clare of former times.  it was chiefly a
difference in his manner that they noticed just now, particularly
his brothers.  he was getting to behave like a farmer; he flung his
legs about; the muscles of his face had grown more expressive; his
eyes looked as much information as his tongue spoke, and more.  the
manner of the scholar had nearly disappeared; still more the manner
of the drawing-room young man.  a prig would have said that he had
lost culture, and a prude that he had become coarse.  such w

drily, "we are very good friends, you
know; each of us treading our allotted circles; but if it comes to
intellectual grasp, i think you, as a contented dogmatist, had
better leave mine alone, and inquire what has become of yours."

they returned down the hill to dinner, which was fixed at any time at
which their father's and mother's morning work in the parish usually
concluded.  convenience as regarded afternoon callers was the last
thing to enter into the consideration of unselfish mr and mrs clare;
though the three sons were sufficiently in unison on this matter to
wish that their parents would conform a little to modern notions.

the walk had made them hungry, angel in particular, who was now
an outdoor man, accustomed to the profuse _dapes inemptae_ of the
dairyman's somewhat coarsely-laden table.  but neither of the old
people had arrived, and it was not till the sons were almost tired of
waiting that their parents entered.  the self-denying pair had been
occupied in coaxing the appet

"we never drink spirits at this table, on principle," added his
father.

"but what shall i tell the dairyman's wife?" said angel.

"the truth, of course," said his father.

"i rather wanted to say we enjoyed the mead and the black-puddings
very much.  she is a kind, jolly sort of body, and is sure to ask me
directly i return."

"you cannot, if we did not," mr clare answered lucidly.

"ah--no; though that mead was a drop of pretty tipple."

"a what?" said cuthbert and felix both.

"oh--'tis an expression they use down at talbothays," replied angel,
blushing.  he felt that his parents were right in their practice if
wrong in their want of sentiment, and said no more.

it was not till the evening, after family prayers, that angel found
opportunity of broaching to his father one or two subjects near his
heart.  he had strung himself up to the purpose

 while kneeling behind
his brothers on the carpet, studying the little nails in the heels of
their walking boots.  when the service was over they went out of the
room with their mother, and mr clare and himself were left alone.

the young man first discussed with the elder his plans for the
attainment of his position as a farmer on an extensive scale--either
in england or in the colonies.  his father then told him that, as he
had not been put to the expense of sending angel up to cambridge, he
had felt it his duty to set by a sum of money every year towards the
purchase or lease of land for him some day, that he might not feel
himself unduly slighted.

"as far as worldly wealth goes," cont

inued his father, "you will no
doubt stand far superior to your brothers in a few years."

this considerateness on old mr clare's part led angel onward to the
other and dearer subject.  he observed to his father that he was
then six-and-twenty, and that when he should start in the farming
business he would require eyes in the back of his head to see to all
matters--some one would be necessary to superintend the domestic
labours of his establishment whilst he was afield.  would it not be
well, therefore, for him to marry?

his father seemed to think this idea not unreasonable; and then angel
put the question--

"what kin

and feel that i may do worse than choose her."  angel waxed quite
earnest on that rather automatic orthodoxy in his beloved tess which
(never dreaming that it might stand him in such good stead) he had
been prone to slight when observing it practised by her and the other
milkmaids, because of its obvious unreality amid beliefs essentially
naturalistic.

in their sad doubts as to whether their son had himself any right
whatever to the title he claimed for the unknown young woman, mr and
mrs clare began to feel it as an advantage not to be overlooked that
she at least was sound in her views; especially as the conjunction of
the pair must have arisen by an act of providence; for angel never
would have made orthodoxy a condition of his choice.  they said
finally that it was better not to act in a hurry, but that they would
not object to see her.

angel therefore refrained from declaring more particulars now.
he felt that, single-minded and self-sacrificing as his parents
were, there yet ex

his mother made him sandwiches, and his father accompanied him,
on his own mare, a little way along the road.  having fairly well
advanced his own affairs, angel listened in a willing silence, as
they jogged on together through the shady lanes, to his father's
account of his parish difficulties, and the coldness of brother
clergymen whom he loved, because of his strict interpretations of
the new testament by the light of what they deemed a pernicious
calvinistic doctrine.

"pernicious!" said mr clare, with genial scorn; and he proceeded to
recount experiences which would show the absurdity of that idea.
he told of wondrous conversions of evil livers of which he had been
the instrument, not only amongst the poor, but amongst the rich and
well-to-do; and he also candidly admitted many failures.

as an instance of the latter, he mentioned the case of a young
upstart squire named d'urberville, living some forty miles off, in
the neighbourhood of trantridge.

"not one of the ancient d'urberville

you express interest in old families.  i thought you set less
store by them even than i."

"you misapprehend me, father; you often do," said angel with a
little impatience.  "politically i am sceptical as to the virtue of
their being old.  some of the wise even among themselves 'exclaim
against their own succession,' as hamlet puts it; but lyrically,
dramatically, and even historically, i am tenderly attached to them."

this distinction, though by no means a subtle one, was yet too
subtle for mr clare the elder, and he went on with the story he had
been about to relate; which was that after the death of the senior
so-called d'urberville, the young man developed the most culpable
passions, though he had a blind mother, whose condition should have
made him know better.  a knowledge of his career having come to
the ears of mr clare, when he was in that part of the country
preaching missionary sermons, he boldly took occasion to speak to
the delinquent on his spiritual state.  though he was a st

occupying another's pulpit, he had felt this to be his duty, and
took for his text the words from st luke: "thou fool, this night thy
soul shall be required of thee!"  the young man much resented this
directness of attack, and in the war of words which followed when
they met he did not scruple publicly to insult mr clare, without
respect for his gray hairs.

angel flushed with distress.

"dear father," he said sadly, "i wish you would not expose yourself
to such gratuitous pain from scoundrels!"

"pain?" said his father, his rugged face shining in the ardour of
self-abnegation.  "the only pain to me was pain on his account, poor,
foolish young man.  do you suppose his incensed words could give
me any pain, or even his blows?  'being reviled we bless; being
persecuted we suffer it; being defamed we entreat; we a

thians are strictly

"not blows, father?  he did not proceed to blows?"

"no, he did not.  though i have borne blows from men in a mad state
of intoxication."

"no!"

"a dozen times, my boy.  what then?  i have saved them from the guilt
of murdering their own flesh and blood thereby; and they have lived
to thank me, and praise god."

"may this young man do the same!" said angel fervently.  "but i fear
otherwise, from what you say."

"we'll hope, nevertheless," said mr clare.  "and i continue to pray
for him, though on this side of the grave we shall probably never
meet again.  but, after all, one of those poor words of mine may
spring up in his heart as a good seed some day."

now, as always, clare's father was sanguine as a child; and though
the younger could not accept his parent's narrow dogma, he revered
his practice and recognized the hero under the pietist.  perhaps he
revered his father's practice even more now than ever, seeing that,

sphere brought him in the afternoon to a detached knoll
a mile or two west of talbothays, whence he again looked into that
green trough of sappiness and humidity, the valley of the var or
froom.  immediately he began to descend from the upland to the fat
alluvial soil below, the atmosphere grew heavier; the languid perfume
of the summer fruits, the mists, the hay, the flowers, formed therein
a vast pool of odour which at this hour seemed to make the animals,
the very bees and butterflies drowsy. clare was now so familiar with
the spot that he knew the individual cows by their names when, a long
distance off, he saw them dotted about the meads.  it was with a
sense of luxury that he recognized his power of viewing life here
from its inner side, in a way that had been quite foreign to him in
his student-days; and, much as he loved his parents, he could not
help being aware that to come here, as now, after an experience of
home-life, affected him like throwing off splints and bandages; even

house to the back quarters, where he listened for a
moment.  sustained snores came from the cart-house, where some of
the men were lying down; the grunt and squeal of sweltering pigs
arose from the still further distance.  the large-leaved rhubarb and
cabbage plants slept too, their broad limp surfaces hanging in the
sun like half-closed umbrellas.

he unbridled and fed his horse, and as he re-entered the house the
clock struck three.  three was the afternoon skimming-hour; and, with
the stroke, clare heard the creaking of the floor-boards above, and
then the touch of a descending foot on the stairs.  it was tess's,
who in another moment came down before his eyes.

she had not heard him enter, and hardly realized his presence there.
she was yawning, and he saw the red interior of her mouth as if it
had been a snake's.  she had stretched one arm so high above her
coiled-up cable of hair that he could see its satin delicacy above
the sunburn; her face was flushed with sleep, and her eyelids hu

heavy over their pupils.  the brim-fulness of her nature breathed
from her.  it was a moment when a woman's soul is more incarnate than
at any other time; when the most spiritual beauty bespeaks itself
flesh; and sex takes the outside place in the presentation.

then those eyes flashed brightly through their filmy heaviness,
before the remainder of her face was well awake.  with an oddly
compounded look of gladness, shyness, and surprise, she exclaimed--"o
mr clare!  how you frightened me--i--"

there had not at first been time for her to think of the changed
relations which his declaration had introduced; but the full sense of
the matter rose up in her face when she encountered clare's tender
look as he stepped forward to the bottom stair.

"dear, darling tessy!" he whispered, putting his arm round her, and
his face to her flushed cheek.  "don't, for heaven's sake, mister me
any more.  i have hastened back so soon because of you!"

their radiating fibrils of blue, and black, and gray, and violet,
while she regarded him as eve at her second waking might have

"i've got to go a-skimming," she pleaded, "and i have on'y old deb to
help me to-day.  mrs crick is gone to market with mr crick, and retty
is not well, and the others are gone out somewhere, and won't be home
till milking."

as they retreated to the milk-house deborah fyander appeared on the
stairs.

"i have come back, deborah," said mr clare, upwards.  "so i can help
tess with the skimming; and, as you are very tired, i am sure, you
needn't come down till milking-time."

possibly the talbothays milk was not very thoroughly skimmed that
afternoon.  tess was in a dream wherein familiar objects appeared
as having light and shade and position, but no particular outline.
every time she held the skimmer under the pump to cool it for the
work her hand trembled, the ardour of his affection being so palpable
that she seemed to flinch under

my wife a woman who knows all about the management of farms.  will
you be that woman, tessy?"

he put it that way that she might not think he had yielded to an
impulse of which his head would disapprove.

she turned quite careworn.  she had bowed to the inevitable result of
proximity, the necessity of loving him; but she had not calculated
upon this sudden corollary, which, indeed, clare had put before her
without quite meaning himself to do it so soon.  with pain that was
like the bitterness of dissolution she murmured the words of her
indispensable and sworn answer as an honourable woman.

"o mr clare--i cannot be your wife--i cannot be!"

the sound of her own decision seemed to break tess's very heart, and
she bowed her face in her grief.

"but, tess!" he said, amazed at her reply, and holding her still more
greedily close.  "do you say no?  surely you love me?"

began anew.  but she could not, as at other times, hit the exact
under-surface of the cream with the delicate dexterity required, try
as she might; sometimes she was cutting down into the milk, sometimes
in the air.  she could hardly see, her eyes having filled with two
blurring tears drawn forth by a grief which, to this her best friend
and dear advocate, she could never explain.

"i can't skim--i can't!" she said, turning away from him.

not to agitate and hinder her longer, the considerate clare began
talking in a more general way:

you quite misapprehend my parents.  they are the most simple-mannered
people alive, and quite unambitious.  they are two of the few
remaining evangelical school.  tessy, are you an evangelical?"

"i don't know."

"you go to church very regularly, and our parson here is not very
high, they tell me."

tess's ideas on the views of the parish clergyman, whom she heard
every week, seemed to be rather more vague than clare's, who had
never heard him at all.

he thinks to be his duty, that he'll do, in season or out of season;
and, of course, he makes many enemies, not only among the absolutely
vicious, but among the easy-going, who hate being bothered.  he says
he glories in what happened, and that good may be done indirectly;
but i wish he would not wear himself out now he is getting old, and
would leave such pigs to their wallowing."

tess's look had grown hard and worn, and her ripe mouth tragical; but
she no longer showed any tremulousness.  clare's revived thoughts of
his father prevented his noticing her particularly; and so they went
on down the white row of liquid rectangles till they had finished
and drained them off, when the other maids returned, and took their
pails, and deb came to scald out the leads for the new milk.  as
tess withdrew to go afield to the cows he said to her softly--

"and my question, tessy?"

"o no--no!" replied she with grave hopelessness, as one who had
heard anew the turmoil of her own past in the allusion

 all the girls drew onward to the spot where the cows
were grazing in the farther mead, the bevy advancing with the bold
grace of wild animals--the reckless, unchastened motion of women
accustomed to unlimited space--in which they abandoned themselves to
the air as a swimmer to the wave.  it seemed natural enough to him
now that tess was again in sight to choose a mate from unconstrained
nature, and not from the abodes of art.

her refusal, though unexpected, did not permanently daunt clare.
his experience of women was great enough for him to be aware that
the negative often meant nothing more than the preface to the
affirmative; and it was little enough for him not to know that in
the manner of the present negative there lay a great exception to
the dallyings of coyness.  that she had already permitted him to
make love to her he read as an additional assurance, not fully
trowing that in the fields and pastures to "sigh gratis" is by no
means deemed waste; love-making being here m

dearest," he quickly added, observing now the remark had cut her, "i
know you to be the most honest, spotless creature that ever lived.
so how can i suppose you a flirt?  tess, why don't you like the idea
of being my wife, if you love me as you seem to do?"

"i have never said i don't like the idea, and i never could say it;
because--it isn't true!"

the stress now getting beyond endurance, her lip quivered, and she
was obliged to go away.  clare was so pained and perplexed that he
ran after and caught her in the passage.

"tell me, tell me!" he said, passionately clasping her, in
forgetfulness of his curdy hands: "do tell me that you won't belong
to anybody but me!"

"i will, i will tell you!" she exclaimed.  "and i will give you a
complete answer, if you will let me go now. i will tell you my
experiences--all about myself--all!"

"your experiences, dear; yes, certainly; any number."  he expressed
assent in loving satire, looking into

"well," said the dairyman, "'tis that slack-twisted 'hore's-bird of a
feller, jack dollop.  he's lately got married to a widow-woman."

"not jack dollop?  a villain--to think o' that!" said a milker.

the name entered quickly into tess durbeyfield's consciousness, for
it was the name of the lover who had wronged his sweetheart, and had
afterwards been so roughly used by the young woman's mother in the
butter-churn.

"and had he married the valiant matron's daughter, as he promised?"
asked angel clare absently, as he turned over the newspaper he was
reading at the little table to which he was always banished by mrs
crick, in her sense of his gentility.

"not he, sir.  never meant to," replied the dairyman. "as i say, 'tis
a widow-woman, and she had money, it seems--fifty poun' a year or so;
and that was all he was after.  they were married in a great hurry;
and then she told him that by marrying she had lost her fifty poun'
a year.  just fancy the state o' my gentleman's mind at that news!

about not telling him beforehand anything whatsomdever about my first
chap that i hadn't chose to tell, i'd ha' knocked him down wi' the
rolling-pin--a scram little feller like he!  any woman could do it."

the laughter which followed this sally was supplemented only by a
sorry smile, for form's sake, from tess.  what was comedy to them was
tragedy to her; and she could hardly bear their mirth.  she soon rose
from table, and, with an impression that clare would soon follow her,
went along a little wriggling path, now stepping to one side of the
irrigating channels, and now to the other, till she stood by the main
stream of the var.  men had been cutting the water-weeds higher up
the river, and masses of them were floating past her--moving islands
of green crow-foot, whereon she might almost have ridden; long locks
of which weed had lodged against the piles driven to keep the cows
from crossing.

yes, there was the pain of it.  this question of a

 woman telling her
story--the heaviest of crosses to herself--seemed but amusement to
others.  it was as if people should laugh at martyrdom.

"tessy!" came from behind her, and clare sprang across the gully,
alighting beside her feet.  "my wife--soon!"

"no, no; i cannot.  for your sake, o mr clare; for your sake, i say
no!"

"tess!"

"still i say no!" she repeated.

not expecting this, he had put his arm lightly round her waist the
moment after speaking, beneath her hanging tail of hair.  (the
younger dairymaids, including tess, breakfasted with their hair loose
on sunday mornings before building it up extra high for attending
church, a style they could not adopt when milking with their heads
against the cows.)  if she had said "yes" instead of "no" he
would have kissed her; it had evide

she could see in his eye that he might ask her again.

his plan of procedure was different now--as though he had made up
his mind that her negatives were, after all, only coyness and youth
startled by the novelty of the proposal.  the fitful evasiveness of
her manner when the subject was under discussion countenanced the
idea.  so he played a more coaxing game; and while never going beyond
words, or attempting the renewal of caresses, he did his utmost
orally.

in this way clare persistently wooed her in undertones like that of
the purling milk--at the cow's side, at skimmings, at butter-makings,
at cheese-makings, among broody poultry, and among farrowing pigs--as
no milkmaid was ever wooed before by such a man.

tess knew that she must break down.  neither a religious sense of a
certain moral validity in the previous union nor a conscientious wish
for candour could hold out against it much longer.  she loved him so
passionately, and he was so godlike in her eyes; and

subject stirred her with a terrifying bliss, and she coveted the
recantation she feared.

his manner was--what man's is not?--so much that of one who would
love and cherish and defend her under any conditions, changes,
charges, or revelations, that her gloom lessened as she basked in it.
the season meanwhile was drawing onward to the equinox, and though
it was still fine, the days were much shorter.  the dairy had again
worked by morning candlelight for a long time; and a fresh renewal
of clare's pleading occurred one morning between three and four.

she had run up in her bedgown to his door to call him as usual;
then had gone back to dress and call the others; and in ten minutes
was walking to the head of the stairs with the candle in her
hand.  at the same moment he came down his steps from above in his
shirt-sleeves and put his arm across the stairway.

"now, miss flirt, before you go down," he said peremptorily. "it is a
fortnight since i spoke, and this won't do any longer.  you

me what you mean, or i shall have to leave this house.  my door was

"i am only just up, mr clare, and it is too early to take me to
task!" she pouted.  "you need not call me flirt.  'tis cruel and
untrue.  wait till by and by.  please wait till by and by!  i will
really think seriously about it between now and then.  let me go
downstairs!"

she looked a little like what he said she was as, holding the candle
sideways, she tried to smile away the seriousness of her words.

"call me angel, then, and not mr clare."

"angel."

"angel dearest--why not?"

"'twould mean that i agree, wouldn't it?

pon the scene; and when they were milked, the cows trailed away.
dairyman crick, who was there with the rest, his wrapper gleaming
miraculously white against a leaden evening sky, suddenly looked
at his heavy watch.

"why, 'tis later than i thought," he said.  "begad!  we shan't be
soon enough with this milk at the station, if we don't mind.  there's
no time to-day to take it home and mix it with the bulk afore sending
off.  it must go to station straight from here.  who'll drive it
across?"

mr clare volunteered to do so, though it was none of his business,
asking tess to accompany him.  the evening, though sunless, had
been warm and muggy for the season, and tess had come out with
her milking-hood only, naked-armed and jacketless; certainly not
dressed for a drive.  she therefore replied by glancing over her
scant habiliments; but clare gently urged her.  she assented by
relinquishing her pail and stool to the dairyman to take home, and
mounted the spring-waggon beside clare.

ter than at a walking pace.  the air was rather
chill.

"i am so afraid you will get cold, with nothing upon your arms and
shoulders," he said.  "creep close to me, and perhaps the drizzle
won't hurt you much.  i should be sorrier still if i did not think
that the rain might be helping me."

she imperceptibly crept closer, and he wrapped round them both a
large piece of sail-cloth, which was sometimes used to keep the sun
off the milk-cans.  tess held it from slipping off him as well as
herself, clare's hands being occupied.

"now we are all right again.  ah--no we are not!  it runs down into
my neck a little, and it must still more into yours.  that's better.
your arms are like wet marble, tess.  wipe them in the cloth.  now,
if you stay quiet, you will not get another drop.  well, dear--about
that question of mine--that long-standing question?"

the only reply that he could hear for a little while was the smack of
the horse's hoofs on the moistening road, and the cluck of the milk

she had not told.  at the last moment her courage had failed her;
she feared his blame for not telling him sooner; and her instinct
of self-preservation was stronger than her candour.

"of course," continued the unwitting clare, "i should have been glad
to know you to be descended exclusively from the long-suffering,
dumb, unrecorded rank and file of the english nation, and not from
the self-seeking few who made themselves powerful at the expense of
the rest.  but i am corrupted away from that by my affection for you,

own sake i rejoice in your descent.  society is hopelessly snobbish,

"yes, yes, yes!  but o, i sometimes wish i had never been born!"

"now, my dear tess, if i did not know that you are very much excited,
and very inexperienced, i should say that remark was not very
complimentary.  how came you to wish that if you care for me?  do you
care for me?  i wish you would prove it in some way."

"how can i prove it more than i have done?" she cried, in a
distraction of tenderness.  "will this prove it more?"

she clasped his neck, and for the first time clare learnt what an
impassioned woman's kisses were like upon the lips of one whom she
loved with all her heart and soul, as tess loved him.

"there--now do you believe?" she asked, flushed, and wiping her eyes.

"yes. i never really doubted--never, never!"

so they drove on through the gloom, forming one bundle inside the
sail-cloth, the horse going as he would, and the rain driving against
them.  she had consented.  she might as well have agreed at first.

uld be.

thus steadied by a command from the only person in the world who had
any shadow of right to control her action, tess grew calmer.  the
responsibility was shifted, and her heart was lighter than it had
been for weeks.  the days of declining autumn which followed her
assent, beginning with the month of october, formed a season through
which she lived in spiritual altitudes more nearly approaching
ecstasy than any other period of her life.

there was hardly a touch of earth in her love for clare.  to her
sublime trustfulness he was all that goodness could be--knew all that
a guide, philosopher, and friend should know.  she thought every line
in the contour of his person the perfection of masculine beauty, his
soul the soul of a saint, his intellect that of a seer.  the wisdom
of her love for him, as love, sustained her dignity; she seemed to be
wearing a crown.  the compassion of his love for her, as she saw it,
made her lift up her heart to him in devotion.  he would sometimes

she dismissed the past--trod upon it and put it out, as one treads on
a coal that is smouldering and dangerous.

she had not known that men could be so disinterested, chivalrous,
protective, in their love for women as he.  angel clare was far from
all that she thought him in this respect; absurdly far, indeed;
but he was, in truth, more spiritual than animal; he had himself
well in hand, and was singularly free from grossness.  though not
cold-natured, he was rather bright than hot--less byronic than
shelleyan; could love desperately, but with a love more especially
inclined to the imaginative and ethereal; it was a fastidious emotion
which could jealously guard the loved one against his very self.

the male sex she swerved to excess of honour for clare.

they unaffectedly sought each other's company; in her honest faith
she did not disguise her desire to be with him.  the sum of her
instincts on this matter, if clearly stated, would have been that the
elusive quality of her sex which attracts men in general might be
distasteful to so perfect a man after an avowal of love, since it
must in its very nature carry with it a suspicion of art.

the country custom of unreserved comradeship out of doors during
betrothal was the only custom she knew,

and to her it had no
strangeness; though it seemed oddly anticipative to clare till he
saw how normal a thing she, in common with all the other dairy-folk,
regarded it.  thus, during this october month of wonderful afternoons
they roved along the meads by creeping paths which followed the
brinks of trickling tributary brooks, hopping across by little wooden
bridges to the other side, and back again.  they were never out of
the sound of some purling weir, whose buzz accompanied their own
murmuring, while the beams of the sun, almost as horizontal as the
mead itself, formed

 a pollen of radiance over the landscape.  they
saw tiny blue fogs in the shadows of trees and hedges, all the time
that there was bright sunshine elsewhere.  the sun was so near the
ground, and the sward so flat, that the shadows of clare and tess
would stretch a quarter of a mile ahead of them, like two long
fingers pointing afar to where the green alluvial reaches abutted
against the sloping sides of the vale.

"you are not ashamed of owning me as yours before them!" she said
gladly.

"o no!"

"but if it should reach the ears of your friends at emminster that
you are walking about like this with me, a milkmaid--"

"the most bewitching milkmaid ever seen."

"they might feel it a hurt to their dignity."

"my dear girl--a d'urberville hurt the dignity of a clare!  it is a
grand card to play--that of your belonging to such a family, and i
am reserving it for a grand effect when we are married, and have
the proofs of your descent from parson tringham.  apart from that,
my future is to be totally foreign to my family--it will not affect
even the surface of their lives.  we shall leave this part of
england--perhaps england itself--and what does it matter how people
regard us here?  you will like going, will you not?"

a spiritual forgetfulness co-existed with an intellectual
remembrance.  she walked in brightness, but she knew that in the
background those shapes of darkness were always spread.  they might
be receding, or they might be approaching, one or the other, a little
every day.


one evening tess and clare were obliged to sit indoors keeping house,
all the other occupants of the domicile being away.  as they talked
she looked thoughtfully up at him, and met his two appreciative eyes.

"i am not worthy of you--no, i am not!" she burst out, jumping up
from her low stool as though appalled at his homage, and the fulness
of her own joy thereat.

clare, deeming the whole basis of her excitement to be that which was
only the smaller part of it, said--

"i won't have you speak like it, dear tess!  disti

he said, good-humouredly, as he spread a cushion for her on the
stool, and seated himself in the settle beside her.  "i wanted to
ask you something, and just then you ran away."

"yes, perhaps i am capricious," she murmured.  she suddenly
approached him, and put a hand upon each of his arms.  "no, angel,
i am not really so--by nature, i mean!"  the more particularly to
assure him that she was not, she placed herself close to him in the
settle, and allowed her head to find a resting-place against clare's
shoulder.  "what did you want to ask me--i am sure i will answer it,"
she continued humbly.

"well, you love me, and have agreed to marry me, and hence there
follows a thirdly, 'when shall the day be?'"

"i like living like this."

"but i must think of starting in business on my own hook with the
new year, or a little later.  and before i get involved in the
multifarious details of my new position, i should like to have
secured my partner."

matrimony--"now, christianer, that shows that folks should never
fancy other folks be supposing things when they bain't.  o no, i
should never ha' thought a word of where she was a sitting to, if
she hadn't told me--not i."

"we are going to be married soon," said clare, with improvised
phlegm.

"ah--and be ye!  well, i am truly glad to hear it, sir.  i've
thought you mid do such a thing for some time.  she's too good for a
dairymaid--i said so the very first day i zid her--and a prize for
any man; and what's more, a wonderful woman for a gentleman-farmer's
wife; he won't be at the mercy of his baily wi' her at his side."

somehow tess disappeared.  she had been even more struck with the
look of the girls who followed crick than abashed by crick's blunt
praise

they were all in bed, and the light was out, marian whispered
across to her--

"you will think of us when you be his wife, tess, and of how we told
'ee that we loved him, and how we tried not to hate you, and did not
hate you, and could not hate you, because you were his choice, and
we never hoped to be chose by him."

they were not aware that, at these words, salt, stinging tears
trickled down upon tess's pillow anew, and how she resolved, with a
bursting heart, to tell all her history to angel clare, despite her
mother's command--to let him for whom she lived and breathed despise
her if he would, and her mother regard her as a fool, rather then
preserve a silence which might be deemed a treachery to him, and
which somehow seemed a wrong to these.

this penitential mood kept her from naming the wedding-day. the
beginning of november found its date still in abeyance, though he
asked her at the most tempting times.  but tess's desire seemed to be
for a perpetual betrothal in which e

"what?"

"i feel the red rising up at her having been caught!  but why should
i trifle so!  we will not trifle--life is too serious."

"it is.  perhaps i saw that before you did."

she was seeing it then.  to decline to marry him after all--in
obedience to her emotion of last night--and leave the dairy, meant
to go to some strange place, not a dairy; for milkmaids were not in
request now calving-time was coming on; to go to some arable farm
where no divine being like angel clare was.  she hated the thought,
and she hated more the thought of going home.

"so that, seriously, dearest tess," he continued, "since you will
probably have to leave at christmas, it is in every way desirable and
convenient that i should carry you off then as my property.  besides,
if you were not the most uncalculating girl in the world you would
know that we could not go on like this for ever."

"i wish we could.  that it would always be summer and autumn, and you

but she wrote anew to her mother, ostensibly to notify the
wedding-day; really to again implore her advice.  it was a gentleman
who had chosen her, which perhaps her mother had not sufficiently
considered.  a post-nuptial explanation, which might be accepted with
a light heart by a rougher man, might not be received with the same
feeling by him.  but this communication brought no reply from mrs
durbeyfield.

despite angel clare's plausible representation to himself and to tess
of the practical need for their immediate marriage, there was in
truth an element of precipitancy in the step, as became apparent at a
later date.  he loved her dearly, though perhaps rather ideally and
fancifully than with the impassioned thoroughness of her feeling for
him.  he had entertained no notion, when doomed as he had thought to
an unintellectual bucolic life, that such charms as he beheld in this
idyllic creature would be found behind

next, he wished to see a little of the working of a flour-mill,
having an idea that he might combine the use of one with
corn-growing.  the proprietor of a large old water-mill at
wellbridge--once the mill of an abbey--had offered him the inspection
of his time-honoured mode of procedure, and a hand in the operations
for a few days, whenever he should choose to come.  clare paid a
visit to the place, some few miles distant, one day at this time,
to inquire particulars, and returned to talbothays in the evening.
she found him determined to spend a short time at the wellbridge
flour-mills. and what had determined him?  less the opportunity of an
insight into grinding and bolting than the casual fact that lodgings
were to be obtained in that very farmhouse which, before its
mutilation, had been the mansion of a branch of the d'urberville
family.  this was always how

she who had been so backward was suddenly fired with impatience and
alarm lest she should lose her dear prize.

a natural incident relieved her anxiety.  izz mentioned the omission
of the banns to mrs crick, and mrs crick assumed a matron's privilege
of speaking to angel on the point.

"have ye forgot 'em, mr clare?  the banns, i mean."

"no, i have not forgot 'em," says clare.

as soon as he caught tess alone he assured her:

"don't let them tease you about the banns.  a licence will be quieter
for us, and i have decided on a licence without consulting you.
so if you go to church on sunday morning you will not hear your own
name, if you wished to."

"i didn't wish to hear it, dearest," she said proudly.

but to know that things were in train was an immense relief to tess
notwithstanding, who had well-nig

negatived the remainder of the definition forthwith.

clare had just returned from the stable-yard, and, confronting the
man on the threshold, heard the words, and saw the shrinking of
tess.  the insult to her stung him to the quick, and before he had
considered anything at all he struck the man on the chin with the
full force of his fist, sending him staggering backwards into the
passage.

the man recovered himself, and seemed inclined to come on, and clare,
stepping outside the door, put himself in a posture of defence.  but
his opponent began to think better of the matter.  he looked anew at
tess as he passed her, and said to clare--

"i beg pardon, sir; 'twas a complete mistake.  i thought she was
another woman, forty miles from here."

clare, feeling then that he had been too hasty, and that he was,
moreover, to blame for leaving her standing in an inn-passage, did
what he usually did in such cases, gave the man five shillings to

low; and thus they parted, bidding each other a pacific
good night.  as soon as clare had taken the reins from the ostler,
and the young couple had driven off, the two men went in the other
direction.

"and was it a mistake?" said the second one.

"not a bit of it.  but i didn't want to hurt the gentleman's
feelings--not i."

in the meantime the lovers were driving onward.

"could we put off our wedding till a little later?" tess asked in a
dry dull voice.  "i mean if we wished?"

"no, my love.  calm yourself.  do you mean that the fellow may have
time to summon me for assault?"

 he asked good-humouredly.

"no--i only meant--if it should have to be put off."

what she meant was not very clear, and he directed her to dismiss
such fancies from her mind, which she obediently did as well as she
could.  but she was grave, very grave, all the way home; till she
thought, "we shall go away, a very long distance, hundreds of miles
from these parts, and such as this can never happen again, and no
ghost of the past reach there."

they parted tenderly that night on the landing, and clare ascended to
his attic.  tess sat up getting on with some little requisites, lest
the few remaining days should not afford sufficient time.  while she
sat she heard a noise in angel's room overhead, a sound of thumping
and struggling.  everybody else in the house was asleep, and in her
anxiety lest clare should be ill she ran up and knocked at his door,
and asked him what was the matter.

"oh, nothing, dear," he said from within.  "i am so sorry i disturbed
you!  but the reason is rather an amus

think of it no more."

this was the last drachm required to turn the scale of her
indecision.  declare the past to him by word of mouth she could not;
but there was another way.  she sat down and wrote on the four pages
of a note-sheet a succinct narrative of those events of three or four
years ago, put it into an envelope, and directed it to clare.  then,
lest the flesh should again be weak, she crept upstairs without any
shoes and slipped the note under his door.

her night was a broken one, as it well might be, and she listened for
the first faint noise overhead.  it came, as usual; he descended, as
usual.  she descended.  he met her at the bottom of the stairs and
kissed her. surely it was as warmly as ever!

he looked a little disturbed and worn, she thought.  but he said not
a word to her about her revelation, even when they were al

 one at least of them there for the day if he
would like to come.  his brothers had not replied at all, seeming
to be indignant with him; while his father and mother had written
a rather sad letter, deploring his precipitancy in rushing into
marriage, but making the best of the matter by saying that, though
a dairywoman was the last daughter-in-law they could have expected,
their son had arrived at an age which he might be supposed to be the
best judge.

this coolness in his relations distressed clare less than it would
have done had he been without the grand card with which he meant to
surprise them ere long.  to produce tess, fresh from the dairy, as
a d'urberville and a lady, he had felt to be temerarious and risky;
hence he had concealed her lineage till such time as, familiarized
with worldly ways by a few months' travel and reading with him, he
could take her on a visit to his parents and impart the knowledge
while triumphantly producing her as worthy of such an ancient line.
it was a

pretty lover's dream, if no more.  perhaps tess's lineage
had more value for himself than for anybody in the world beside.

her perception that angel's bearing towards her still remained in no
whit altered by her own communication rendered tess guiltily doubtful
if he could have received it.  she rose from breakfast before he had
finished, and hastened upstairs.  it had occurred to her to look once
more into the queer gaunt room which had been clare's den, or rather
eyrie, for so long, and climbing the ladder she stood at the open
door of the apartment, regarding and pondering.  she stooped to the
threshold of the doorway, where she had pushed in the note two or
three days earlier in such excitement.  the carpet reached close to
the sill, and under the edge of the carpet she discerned the faint
white margin of the envelope containing her letter to him, which he
obviously had never seen, owing to her having in her haste thrust it

she was so pale when he saw her again that he felt quite anxious.
the incident of the misplaced letter she had jumped at as if it
prevented a confession; but she knew in her conscience that it need
not; there was still time.  yet everything was in a stir; there
was coming and going; all had to dress, the dairyman and mrs crick
having been asked to accompany them as witnesses; and reflection or
deliberate talk was well-nigh impossible.  the only minute tess could
get to be alone with clare was when they met upon the landing.

"i am so anxious to talk to you--i want to confess all my faults and
blunders!" she said with attempted lightness.

"no, no--we can't have faults talked of--you must be deemed perfect
to-day at least, my sweet!" he cried.  "we shall have plenty of time,
hereafter, i hope, to talk over our failings.  i will confess mine at
the same time."

"but it would be better for me to do it now, i think, so that you
could not say--"

"well, my quixotic one, you shall tel

not be present. they were not worldly young fellows, but fraternizing
with dairy-folk would have struck unpleasantly upon their biased
niceness, apart from their views of the match.

upheld by the momentum of the time, tess knew nothing of this, did
not see anything, did not know the road they were taking to the
church.  she knew that angel was close to her; all the rest was
a luminous mist.  she was a sort of celestial person, who owed
her being to poetry--one of those classical divinities clare was
accustomed to talk to her about when they took their walks together.

the marriage being by licence there were only a dozen or so of people
in the church; had there been a thousand they would have produced
no more effect upon her.  they were at stellar distances from her
present world.  in the ecstatic solemnity with which she swore her
faith to him the ordinary sensibilities of sex seemed a flippancy.
at a pause in the service, while they were kneeling together, she
unconsciously inclined

not her own, like the angel whom st john saw in the sun, lasted till
the sound of the church bells had died away, and the emotions of the
wedding-service had calmed down.  her eyes could dwell upon details
more clearly now, and mr and mrs crick having directed their own gig
to be sent for them, to leave the carriage to the young couple, she
observed the build and character of that conveyance for the first
time.  sitting in silence she regarded it long.

"i fancy you seem oppressed, tessy," said clare.

"yes," she answered, putting her hand to her brow.  "i tremble at
many things.  it is all so serious, angel.  among other things i seem
to have seen this carriage before, to be very well acquainted with
it.  it is very odd--i must have seen it in a dream."

"oh--you have heard the legend of the d'urberville coach--that
well-known superstition of this county about your family when they
were very popular here; and this lumbering old thing reminds you of
it."

"i have never heard of it to my kno

amily see or hear the old coach whenever--but i'll tell you
another day--it is rather gloomy.  evidently some dim knowledge of
it has been brought back to your mind by the sight of this venerable
caravan."

"i don't remember hearing it before," she murmured.  "is it when we
are going to die, angel, that members of my family see it, or is it
when we have committed a crime?"

"now, tess!"

he silenced her by a kiss.

by the time they reached home she was contrite and spiritless.  she
was mrs angel clare, indeed, but had she any moral right to the name?
was she not more truly mrs alexander d'urberville?  could intensity
of love justify what might be considered in upright souls as culpable
reticence?  she knew not what was expected of women in such cases;
and she had no counsellor.

however, when she found herself alone in her room for a few
minutes--the last day this on which she was ever to enter it--she
knelt down and prayed.  she tried to pray to god, but it was her
husband who really had he

ll formality--which
was all that it was to him--and as he passed them he kissed them in
succession where they stood, saying "goodbye" to each as he did so.
when they reached the door tess femininely glanced back to discern
the effect of that kiss of charity; there was no triumph in her
glance, as there might have been.  if there had it would have
disappeared when she saw how moved the girls all were.  the kiss had
obviously done harm by awakening feelings they were trying to subdue.

of all this clare was unconscious.  passing on to the wicket-gate he
shook hands with the dairyman and his wife, and expressed his last
thanks to them for their attentions; after which there was a moment
of silence before they had moved off.  it was interrupted by the
crowing of a cock.  the white one with the rose comb had come and
settled on the palings in front of the house, within a few yards of
them, and his notes thrilled their ears through, dwindling away like
echoes down a valley of rocks.

"oh?" said mr

two men were standing by the yard gate, holding it open.

"that's bad," one murmured to the other, not thinking that the words
could be heard by the group at the door-wicket.

the cock crew again--straight towards clare.

"well!" said the dairyman.

"i don't like to hear him!" said tess to her husband.  "tell the man
to drive on.  goodbye, goodbye!"

the cock crew again.

"hoosh!  just you be off, sir, or i'll twist your neck!" said the
dairyman with some irritation, turning to the bird and driving him
away.  and to his wife as they went indoors: "now, to think o' that
just to-day!  i've not heard his crow of an afternoon all the year
afore."

"it only means a change in the weather," said she; "not what you

miles, and, reaching wellbridge, turned away from the village to the
left, and over the great elizabethan bridge which gives the place
half its name.  immediately behind it stood the house wherein they
had engaged lodgings, whose exterior features are so well known to
all travellers through the froom valley; once portion of a fine
manorial residence, and the property and seat of a d'urberville, but
since its partial demolition a farmhouse.

"welcome to one of your ancestral mansions!" said clare as he handed
her down.  but he regretted the pleasantry; it was too near a satire.

on entering they found that, though they had only engaged a couple
of rooms, the farmer had taken advantage of their proposed presence
during the coming days to pay a new year's visit to some friends,
leaving a woman from a neighbouring cottage to minister to their
few wants.  the absoluteness of possession pleased them, and they
realized it as the first moment of their experience under their own
exclusive roof-

the long pointed features, narrow eye, and smirk of the one, so
suggestive of merciless treachery; the bill-hook nose, large
teeth, and bold eye of the other suggesting arrogance to the point
of ferocity, haunt the beholder afterwards in his dreams.

"whose portraits are those?" asked clare of the charwoman.

"i have been told by old folk that they were ladies of the
d'urberville family, the ancient lords of this manor," she said,
"owing to their being builded into the wall they can't be moved
away."

the unpleasantness of the matter was that, in addition to their
effect upon tess, her fine features were unquestionably traceable
in these exaggerated forms.  he said nothing of this, however, and,
regretting that he had gone out of his way to choose the house for
their bridal time,

went on into the adjoining room.  the place having
been rather hastily prepared for them, they washed their hands in one
basin.  clare touched hers under the water.

"which are my fingers and which are yours?" he said, looking up.
"they are very much mixed."

"they are all yours," said she, very prettily, and endeavoured
to be gayer than she was.  he had not been displeased with her
thoughtfulness on such an occasion; it was what every sensible woman
would show: but tess knew that she had been thoughtful to excess,
and struggled against it.

the sun was so low on that short last afternoon of the year that it
shone in through a

fore it grew dark.  but evening began
to close in, and the luggage did not arrive, and they had brought
nothing more than they stood in.  with the departure of the sun the
calm mood of the winter day changed.  out of doors there began noises
as of silk smartly rubbed; the restful dead leaves of the preceding
autumn were stirred to irritated resurrection, and whirled about
unwillingly, and tapped against the shutters.  it soon began to rain.

"that cock knew the weather was going to change," said clare.

the woman who had attended upon them had gone home for the night, but
she had placed candles upon the table, and now they lit them.  each
candle-flame drew towards the fireplace.

"these old houses are so draughty," continued angel, looking at the
flames, and at the grease guttering down the sides.  "i wonder where
that luggage is.  we haven't even a brush and comb."

"i don't know," she answered, absent-minded.

"tess, you are not a bit cheerful this evening--not at all as you
used to be.  t

eally love me,
after all?"

he knew that she did, and the words had no serious intent; but she
was surcharged with emotion, and winced like a wounded animal.
though she tried not to shed tears, she could not help showing one
or two.

"i did not mean it!" said he, sorry.  "you are worried at not having
your things, i know.  i cannot think why old jonathan has not come
with them.  why, it is seven o'clock?  ah, there he is!"

a knock had come to the door, and, there being nobody else to answer
it, clare went out.  he returned to the room with a small package in
his hand.

"it is not jonathan, after all," he said.

"how vexing!" said tess.

the packet had been brought by a special messenger, who had arrived
at talbothays from emminster vicarage immediately after the departure
of the married couple, and had followed them hither, being under
injunction to deliver it into nobody's hands but theirs.  clare
brought it to the light.  it was less than a foot long, sewed up in
canvas, sealed in red wax

 with his father's seal, and directed in his
father's hand to "mrs angel clare."

"it is a little wedding-present for you, tess," said he, handing it
to her.  "how thoughtful they are!"

tess looked a little flustered as she took it.

"i think i would rather have you open it, dearest," said she, turning
over the parcel.  "i don't like to break those great seals; they look
so serious.  please open it for me!"

he undid the parcel.  inside was a case of morocco leather, on the
top of which lay a note and a key.

the note was for clare, in the following words:


   my dear s

   somewhat incongruous act in the circumstances, i am, as
   you will see, bound to hand over the articles to the
   woman to whom the use of them for her lifetime will now
   rightly belong, and they are therefore promptly sent.
   they become, i believe, heirlooms, strictly speaking,
   according to the terms of your godmother's will.  the
   precise words of the clause that refers to this matter
   are enclosed.


"i do remember," said clare; "but i had quite forgotten."

unlocking the case, they found it to contain a necklace, with
pendant, bracelets, and ear-rings; and also some other small
ornaments.

tess seemed afraid to touch them at first, but her eyes sparkled for
a moment as much as the stones when clare spread out the set.

"are they mine?" she asked incredulously.

"they are, certainly," said he.

he looked into the fire.  he remembered how, when he was a lad of
fifteen, his godmother, the squire's wife--the only rich pe

at ironically now.  "yet why?"
he asked himself.  it was but a question of vanity throughout; and
if that were admitted into one side of the equation it should be
admitted into the other.  his wife was a d'urberville: whom could
they become better than her?

suddenly he said with enthusiasm--

"tess, put them on--put them on!"  and he turned from the fire to
help her.

but as if by magic she had already donned them--necklace, ear-rings,
bracelets, and all.

"but the gown isn't right, tess," said clare.  "it ought to be a low
one for a set of brilliants like that."

"ought it?" said tess.

"yes," said he.

he suggested to her how to tuck in the upper edge of her bodice, so
as to make it roughly approximate to the cut for evening wear; and
when she had done this, and the pendant to the necklace hung isolated
amid the whiteness of her throat, as it was designed to do, he
stepped back to survey her.

"my heavens," said clare, "how beautiful you are!"

as everybody knows, fine feathers make fine

n to you, love."

this, from him, so unexpectedly apposite, had the effect upon her of
a providential interposition.

"you have to confess something?" she said quickly, and even with
gladness and relief.

"you did not expect it?  ah--you thought too highly of me.  now
listen.  put your head there, because i want you to forgive me, and
not to be indignant with me for not telling you before, as perhaps
i ought to have done."

how strange it was!  he seemed to be her double.  she did not speak,
and clare went on--

"i did not mention it because i was afraid of endangering my chance
of you, darling, the great prize of my life--my fellowship i call
you.  my brother's fellowship was won at his college, mine at
talbothays dairy.  well, i would not risk it.  i was going to tell
you a month ago--at the time you agreed to be mine, but i could not;
i thought it might frighten you away from me.  i put it off; then i
thought i would tell you yesterday, to give you a chance at least of
escaping me.  but i

untasted.  this was what their _agape_ had come to.  at
tea, two or three hours earlier, they had, in the freakishness of
affection, drunk from one cup.

the closing of the door behind him, gently as it had been pulled
to, roused tess from her stupor.  he was gone; she could not stay.
hastily flinging her cloak around her she opened the door and
followed, putting out the candles as if she were never coming back.
the rain was over and the night was now clear.

she was soon close at his heels, for clare walked slowly and without
purpose.  his form beside her light gray figure looked black,
sinister, and forbidding, and she felt as sarcasm the touch of the
jewels of which she had been momentarily so proud.  clare turned at
hearing her footsteps, but his recognition of her presence seemed
to make no difference to him, and he went on over the five yawning
arches of the great bridge in front of the house.

transit as she passed; she would not have known they were shining

universe imaged in objects so mean.

the place to which they had travelled to-day was in the same
valley as talbothays, but some miles lower down the river; and the
surroundings being open, she kept easily in sight of him.  away from
the house the road wound through the meads, and along these she
followed clare without any attempt to come up with him or to attract
him, but with dumb and vacant fidelity.

at last, however, her listless walk brought her up alongside him, and
still he said nothing.  the cruelty of fooled honesty is often great
after enlightenment, and it was mighty in clare now.  the outdoor air
had apparently taken away from him all tendency to act on impulse;
she knew that he saw her without irradiation--in all her bareness;
that time was chanting his satiric psalm at her then--

      shall be pain.


he was still intently thinking, and her companionship had now
insufficient power to break or divert the strain of thought.  what a
weak thing her presence must have become to him!  she could not help
addressing clare.

"what have i done--what have i done!  i have not told of anything
that interferes with or belies my love for you.  you don't think i
planned it, do you?  it is in your own mind what you are angry at,
angel; it is not in me.  o, it is not in me, and i am not that
deceitful woman you think me!"

"h'm--well.  not deceitful, my wife; but not the same.  no, not the
same.  but do not make me reproach you.  i have sworn that i will
not; and i will do everything to avoid it."

but she went on pleadin

having nothing more to fear, having scarce anything to hope, for that
he would relent there seemed no promise whatever, she lay down dully.
when sorrow ceases to be speculative, sleep sees her opportunity.
among so many happier moods which forbid repose this was a mood which
welcomed it, and in a few minutes the lonely tess forgot existence,
surrounded by the aromatic stillness of the chamber that had once,
possibly, been the bride-chamber of her own ancestry.

later on that night clare also retraced his steps to the house.
entering softly to the sitting-room he obtained a light, and with the
manner of one who had considered his course he spread his rugs upon
the old horse-hair sofa which stood there, and roughly shaped it to
a sleeping-couch.  before lying down he crept shoeless upstairs, and
listened at the door of her apartment.  her measured breathing told
that she was sleeping profoundly.

"thank god!" murmured clare; and yet he was conscious of a pang of
bitterness at th

the presence of a third person in the house would be extremely
awkward just now, and, being already dressed, he opened the window
and informed her that they could manage to shift for themselves that
morning.  she had a milk-can in her hand, which he told her to leave
at the door.  when the dame had gone away he searched in the back
quarters of the house for fuel, and speedily lit a fire.  there was
plenty of eggs, butter, bread, and so on in the larder, and clare
soon had breakfast laid, his experiences at the dairy having rendered
him facile in domestic preparations.  the smoke of the kindled wood
rose from the chimney without like a lotus-headed column; local
people who were passing by saw it, and thought of the newly-married
couple, and envied their happiness.

angel cast a final glance round, and then going to the foot of the
stairs, called in a conventional voice--

"breakfast is ready!"

he opened the front door, and took a few steps in the mornin

hings.  as she
was fully attired, and the interval since his calling her had been
but two or three minutes, she must have been dressed or nearly so
before he went to summon her.  her hair was twisted up in a large
round mass at the back of her head, and she had put on one of the
new frocks--a pale blue woollen garment with neck-frillings of
white.  her hands and face appeared to be cold, and she had possibly
been sitting dressed in the bedroom a long time without any fire.
the marked civility of clare's tone in calling her seemed to have
inspired her, for the moment, with a new glimmer of hope.  but it
soon died when she looked at him.

the pair were, in truth, but the ashes of their former fires.  to the
hot sorrow of the previous night had succeeded heaviness; it seemed
as if nothing could kindle either of them to fervour of sensation any
more.

he spoke gently to her, and she replied with a like
undemonstrativeness.  at last she came up to him, looking in his
sharply-defined face as one w

enhood upon tess's countenance that he gazed
at her with a stupefied air.

"tess!  say it is not true!  no, it is not true!"

"it is true."

"every word?"

"every word."

he looked at her imploringly, as if he would willingly have taken a
lie from her lips, knowing it to be one, and have made of it, by some
sort of sophistry, a valid denial. however, she only repeated--

"it is true."

"is he living?" angel then asked.

"the baby died."

"but the man?"

"he is alive."

a last despair passed over clare's face.

"is he in england?"

"yes."

he took a few vague steps.

"my position--is this," he said abruptly.  "i thought--any man would
have thought--that by giving up all ambition to win a wife with
social standing, with fortune, with knowledge of the world, i should
secure rustic innocence as surely as i should secure pink cheeks;
but--however, i am no man to reproach you, and i will not."

tess felt his position so entirely that the remainder had not been
needed.  therein lay just the distres

he murmured, in piteous raillery.  "you mean in name!
well, i don't want to be anything more."

"you may think so, tess!  you are.  what do you mean?"

"i don't know," she said hastily, with tears in her accents.  "i
thought i--because i am not respectable, i mean.  i told you i
thought i was not respectable enough long ago--and on that account
i didn't want to marry you, only--only you urged me!"

she broke into sobs, and turned her back to him.  it would almost
have won round any man but angel clare.  within the remote depths of
his constitution, so gentle and affectionate as he was in general,
there lay hidden a hard logical deposit, like a vein of metal in a
soft loam, which turned the edge of everything that attempted to
traverse it.  it had blocked his acceptance of the church; it blocked
his acceptance of tess.  moreover, his affection itself was less fire
than radiance, and, with regard to the other sex, when he ceased
to believe he ceased to follow: contrasting in this with many

activities in his endeavour to think of a plan of procedure.  she
was awe-stricken to discover such determination under such apparent
flexibility.  his consistency was, indeed, too cruel.  she no longer
expected forgiveness now.  more than once she thought of going away
from him during his absence at the mill; but she feared that this,
instead of benefiting him, might be the means of hampering and
humiliating him yet more if it should become known.

meanwhile clare was meditating, verily.  his thought had been
unsuspended; he was becoming ill with thinking; eaten out with
thinking, withered by thinking; scourged out of all his former
pulsating, flexuous domesticity.  he walked about saying to himself,
"what's to be done--what's to be done?" and by chance she overheard
him.  it caused her to break the reserve about their future which had
hitherto prevailed.

"i suppose--you are not going to live with me--long, are you, angel?"
she asked, the sunk corners o

s centre.  sheer experience had already taught her that in some
circumstances there was one thing better than to lead a good life,
and that was to be saved from leading any life whatever.  like all
who have been previsioned by suffering, she could, in the words of
m. sully-prudhomme, hear a penal sentence in the fiat, "you shall be
born," particularly if addressed to potential issue of hers.

yet such is the vulpine slyness of dame nature, that, till now, tess
had been hoodwinked by her love for clare into forgetting it might
result in vitalizations that would inflict upon others what she had
bewailed as misfortune to herself.

she therefore could not withstand his argument.  but with the
self-combating proclivity of the supersensitive, an answer thereto
arose in clare's own mind, and he almost feared it.  it was based
on her exceptional physical nature; and she might have used it
promisingly. she might have added besides: "on an australian upland
or texan plain, who is to know or care about

the momentary presentment as if it were the inevitable.  and she
may have been right.  the intuitive heart of woman knoweth not only
its own bitterness, but its husband's, and even if these assumed
reproaches were not likely to be addressed to him or to his by
strangers, they might have reached his ears from his own fastidious
brain.

it was the third day of the estrangement.  some might risk the odd
paradox that with more animalism he would have been the nobler man.
we do not say it.  yet clare's love was doubtless ethereal to a
fault, imaginative to impracticability.  with these natures, corporal
presence is something less appealing than corporal absence; the
latter creating an ideal presence that conveniently drops the defects
of the real.  she found that her personality did not plead her cause
so forcibly as she had anticipated.  the figurative phrase was true:
she was another woman than the one who had excited his desire.

"i have thought over what you say," she remarked to him, m

, which, as usual, was loosely nailed.  she saw the
door of her bedroom open, and the figure of her husband crossed the
stream of moonlight with a curiously careful tread.  he was in his
shirt and trousers only, and her first flush of joy died when she
perceived that his eyes were fixed in an unnatural stare on vacancy.
when he reached the middle of the room he stood still and murmured in
tones of indescribable sadness--

"dead! dead! dead!"

under the influence of any strongly-disturbing force, clare would
occasionally walk in his sleep, and even perform strange feats, such
as he had done on the night of their return from market just before
their marriage, when he re-enacted in his bedroom his combat with the
man who had insulted her.  tess saw that continued mental distress
had wrought him into that somnambulistic state now.

her loyal confidence in him lay so deep down in her heart, that,
awake or asleep, he inspired her with no sort of personal fear.  if

 should choose.  it was consoling,
under the hovering terror of to-morrow's separation, to feel that he
really recognized her now as his wife tess, and did not cast her off,
even if in that recognition he went so far as to arrogate to himself
the right of harming her.

ah! now she knew what he was dreaming of--that sunday morning when he
had borne her along through the water with the other dairymaids, who
had loved him nearly as much as she, if that were possible, which
tess could hardly admit.  clare did not cross the bridge with her,
but proceeding several paces on the same side towards the adjoining
mill, at length stood still on the brink of the river.

its waters, in creeping down these miles of meadowland, frequently
divided, serpentining in purposeless curves, looping themselves
around little islands that had no name, returning and re-embodying
themselves as a broad main stream further on.  opposite the spot to
which he had brought her was such a general confluence, and the river

here they were within a plantation which formed the abbey grounds,
and taking a new hold of her he went onward a few steps till they
reached the ruined choir of the abbey-church.  against the north wall
was the empty stone coffin of an abbot, in which every tourist with
a turn for grim humour was accustomed to stretch himself.  in this
clare carefully laid tess.  having kissed her lips a second time he
breathed deeply, as if a greatly desired end were attained.  clare
then lay down on the ground alongside, when he immediately fell into
the deep dead slumber of exhaustion, and remained motionless as a
log.  the spurt of mental excitement which had produced the effort
was now over.

tess sat up in the coffin.  the night, though dry and mild for the
season, was more than sufficiently cold to make it dangerous for him
to remain here long, in his half-clothed state.  if he were left to
himself he would in all probability stay there till the morning, and

e same time taking him suggestively
by the arm.  to her relief, he unresistingly acquiesced; her words
had apparently thrown him back into his dream, which thenceforward
seemed to enter on a new phase, wherein he fancied she had risen as a
spirit, and was leading him to heaven. thus she conducted him by the
arm to the stone bridge in front of their residence, crossing which
they stood at the manor-house door.  tess's feet were quite bare, and
the stones hurt her, and chilled her to the bone; but clare was in
his woollen stockings, and appeared to feel no discomfort.

there was no further difficulty.  she induced him to lie down on his
own sofa bed, and covered him up warmly, lighting a temporary fire of
wood, to dry any dampness out of him.  the noise of these attentions
she thought might awaken him, and secretly wished that they might.
but the exhaustion of his mind and body was such that he remained
undisturbed.

as soon as they met the next morning tess divined that angel knew

; he knew that
if any intention of his, concluded over-night, did not vanish in the
light of morning, it stood on a basis approximating to one of pure
reason, even if initiated by impulse of feeling; that it was so
far, therefore, to be trusted.  he thus beheld in the pale morning
light the resolve to separate from her; not as a hot and indignant
instinct, but denuded of the passionateness which had made it scorch
and burn; standing in its bones; nothing but a skeleton, but none the
less there.  clare no longer hesitated.

at breakfast, and while they were packing the few remaining articles,
he showed his weariness from the night's effort so unmistakeably that
tess was on the point of revealing all that had happened; but the
reflection that it would anger him, grieve him, stultify him, to know
that he had instinctively manifested a fondness for her of which his
common-sense did not approve, that his inclination had compromised
his dignity when reason slept, again deterred her.  it was too mu

opportunity it gave her of appealing to him anew not to go.

he had ordered by letter a vehicle from the nearest town, and
soon after breakfast it arrived.  she saw in it the beginning of
the end--the temporary end, at least, for the revelation of his
tenderness by the incident of the night raised dreams of a possible
future with him.  the luggage was put on the top, and the man drove
them off, the miller and the old waiting-woman expressing some
surprise at their precipitate departure, which clare attributed to
his discovery that the mill-work was not of the modern kind which he
wished to investigate, a statement that was true so far as it went.
beyond this there was nothing in the manner of their leaving to
suggest a fiasco, or that they were not going together to visit
friends.

their route lay near the dairy from which they had started with such
solemn joy in each other a few days back, and as clare wished to wind
up his business with mr crick, tess could hardly avoid paying mrs

 a call at the same time, unless she would excite suspicion of
their unhappy state.

to make the call as unobtrusive as possible, they left the carriage
by the wicket leading down from the high road to the dairy-house, and
descended the track on foot, side by side.  the withy-bed had been
cut, and they could see over the stumps the spot to which clare had
followed her when he pressed her to be his wife; to the left the
enclosure in which she had been fascinated by his harp; and far away
behind the cow-stalls the mead which had been the scene of their
first embrace.  the gold of the summer picture was now gray, the
colours mean, the rich soil mud, and the river cold.

over the barton-gate the dairyman saw them, and came forward,
throwing into his face the kind of jocularity deemed appropriate
in talbothays and its vicinity on the re-appearanc

they behaved as would have been ordinary.  and then, although she
would rather there had been no word spoken on the subject, tess had
to hear in detail the story of marian and retty.  the later had gone
home to her father's, and marian had left to look for employment
elsewhere.  they feared she would come to no good.

to dissipate the sadness of this recital tess went and bade all her
favourite cows goodbye, touching each of them with her hand, and as
she and clare stood side by side at leaving, as if united body and
soul, there would have been something peculiarly sorry in their
aspect to one who should have seen it truly; two limbs of one life,
as they outwardly were, his arm touching hers, her skirts touching
him, facing one way, as against all the dairy facing the other,
speaking in their adieux as "we", and yet sundered like the poles.

they re-entered the vehicle, and were driven along the roads towards
weatherbury and stagfoot lane, till they reached the lane inn, where
clare dismissed the fly and man.  they rested here a while, and
entering the vale were next driven onward towards her home by a
stranger who did not know their relations.  at a midway point, when
nuttlebury had been passed, and where there were cross-roads, clare
stopped the conveyance and said to tess that if she meant to return
to her mother's house it was here that he would leave her.  as they
could not talk with freedom in the driver's presence he asked her to
accompany him for a few steps on foot along one of the branch roads;
she assented, and directing the man to wait a few minutes they
strolled away.

"now, let us understand each other," he said gently.  "there is no
anger between us, though there is that which i cannot endure at

in which seemed to be tess's for her life only (if he
understood the wording of the will), he advised her to let him send
to a bank for safety; and to this she readily agreed.

these things arranged, he walked with tess back to the carriage,
and handed her in.  the coachman was paid and told where to drive
her.  taking next his own bag and umbrella--the sole articles he had
brought with him hitherwards--he bade her goodbye; and they parted
there and then.

the fly moved creepingly up a hill, and clare watched it go with an
unpremeditated hope that tess would look out of the window for one
moment.  but that she never thought of doing, would not have ventured
to do, lying in a half-dead faint inside.  thus he beheld her recede,
and in the anguish of his heart quoted a line from a poet, with
peculiar emendations of his own--


    god's not in his heaven:
    all's wrong with the world!


when tess had passed over the crest of the hill he turned to go his
own way, and hardly knew that he loved

the perception that her word could be doubted even here, in her own
parental house, set her mind against the spot as nothing else could
have done.  how unexpected were the attacks of destiny!  and if her
father doubted her a little, would not neighbours and acquaintance
doubt her much?  o, she could not live long at home!

a few days, accordingly, were all that she allowed herself here, at
the end of which time she received a short note from clare, informing
her that he had gone to the north of england to look at a farm.  in
her craving for the lustre of her true position as his wife, and to
hide from her parents the vast extent of the division between them,
she made use of this letter as her reason for again departing,
leaving them under the impression that she was setting out to join
him.  still further to screen her husband from any imputation of
unkindness to her, she took twenty-five of the fifty pounds clare
had given her, and hand

ed the sum over to her mother, as if the wife
of a man like angel clare could well afford it, saying that it was a
slight return for the trouble and humiliation she had brought upon
them in years past.  with this assertion of her dignity she bade them
farewell; and after that there were lively doings in the durbeyfield
household for some time on the strength of tess's bounty, her mother
saying, and, indeed, believing, that the rupture which had arisen
between the young husband and wife had adjusted itself under their
strong feeling that they could not live apart fr

it was three weeks after the marriage that clare found himself
descending the hill which led to the well-known parsonage of his
father.  with his downward course the tower of the church rose into
the evening sky in a manner of inquiry as to why he had come; and no
living person in the twilighted town seemed to notice him, still less
to expect him.  he was arriving like a ghost, and the sound of his
own footsteps was almost an encumbrance to be got rid of.

the picture of life had changed for him.  before this time he had

his conduct during these first weeks had been desultory beyond
description.  after mechanically attempting to pursue his
agricultural plans as though nothing unusual had happened, in
the manner recommended by the great and wise men of all ages, he
concluded that very few of those great and wise men had ever gone so
far outside themselves as to test the feasibility of their counsel.
"this is the chief thing: be not perturbed," said the pagan moralist.
that was just clare's own opinion.  but he was perturbed.  "let not
your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid," said the nazarene.
clare chimed in cordially; but his heart was troubled all the same.
how he would have liked to confront those two great thinkers, and
earnestly appeal to them as fellow-man to fellow-men, and ask them
to tell him their method!

he fancied he was looking on his own existence with the passive
interest of an outsi

either of his brothers was now at home.  angel
entered, and closed the door quietly behind him.

"but--where's your wife, dear angel?" cried his mother.  "how you
surprise us!"

"she is at her mother's--temporarily.  i have come home rather in a
hurry because i've decided to go to brazil."

"brazil!  why they are all roman catholics there surely!"

"are they?  i hadn't thought of that."

but even the novelty and painfulness of his going to a papistical
land could not displace for long mr and mrs clare's natural interest
in their son's marriage.

"we had your brief note three weeks ago announcing that it had taken
place," said mrs clare, "and your father sent your godmother's gift
to her, as you know.  of course it was best that none of us should be
present, especially as you preferred to marry her from the dairy, and
not at her home, wherever that may be.  it would have embarrassed
you, and given us no pleasure.  your bothers felt that very strongly.
now it is done we do not complain, partic

come back."

"and i shall not see her before you start?"

he was afraid they would not.  his original plan had been, as he had
said, to refrain from bringing her there for some little while--not
to wound their prejudices--feelings--in any way; and for other
reasons he had adhered to it.  he would have to visit home in the
course of a year, if he went out at once; and it would be possible
for them to see her before he started a second time--with her.

a hastily prepared supper was brought in, and clare made further
exposition of his plans.  his mother's disappointment at not seeing
the bride still remained with her.  clare's late enthusiasm for tess
had infected her through her maternal sympathies, till she had almost
fancied that a good thing could come out of nazareth--a charming
woman out of talbothays dairy. she watched her son as he ate.

"cannot you describe her?  i am sure she is very pretty, angel."

"of that there can be no question!" he said, with a zest which

"scarcely."

"you were her first love?"

"of course."

"there are worse wives than these simple, rosy-mouthed, robust girls
of the farm.  certainly i could have wished--well, since my son is to
be an agriculturist, it is perhaps but proper that his wife should
have been accustomed to an outdoor life."

his father was less inquisitive; but when the time came for the
chapter from the bible which was always read before evening prayers,
the vicar observed to mrs clare--

"i think, since angel has come, that it will be more appropriate to
read the thirty-first of proverbs than the chapter which we should
have had in the usual course of our reading?"

"yes, certainly," said mrs clare.  "the words of king lemuel" (she
could cite chapter and verse as well as her husband).  "my dear son,
your father has decided to read us the chapter in proverbs in praise
of a virtuous wife.  we shall not need to be reminded to apply the
words to the absent one.  may heaven shiel

d her in all her ways!"

a lump rose in clare's throat.  the portable lectern was taken out
from the corner and set in the middle of the fireplace, the two old
servants came in, and angel's father began to read at the tenth verse
of the aforesaid chapter--


   "who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far
   above rubies.  she riseth while it is yet night, and
   giveth meat to her household.  she girdeth her loins
   with strength and strengtheneth her arms.  she
   perceiveth that her merchandise is good; her candle

could have seen her, angel.  since she is pure and chaste, she would
have been refined enough for me."

clare could bear this no longer.  his eyes were full of tears, which
seemed like drops of molten lead.  he bade a quick good night to
these sincere and simple souls whom he loved so well; who knew
neither the world, the flesh, nor the devil in their own hearts, only
as something vague and external to themselves.  he went to his own
chamber.

his mother followed him, and tapped at his door.  clare opened it to
discover her standing without, with anxious eyes.

"angel," she asked, "is there something wrong that you go away so
soon?  i am quite sure you are not yourself."

"i am not, quite, mother," said he.

"about her?  now, my son, i know it is that--i know it is about her!
have you quarrelled in these three weeks?"

"we have not exactly quarrelled," he said.  "but we have had a
difference--"

"angel--is she a young woman whose history will bear investigation?"

with a mother's instinct

 mrs clare had put her finger on the kind of
trouble that would cause such a disquiet as seemed to agitate her
son.

"she is spotless!" he replied; and felt that if it had sent him to
eternal hell there and then he would have told that lie.

"then never mind the rest.  after all, there are few purer things in
nature then an unsullied country maid. any crudeness of manner which
may offend your more educated sense at first, will, i am sure,
disappear under the influence or your companionship and tuition."

such terrible sarcasm of blind magnanimity brought home to clare the
secondary perception that he had utterly wrecked his career by this
marriage, which had not been among his early thoughts after the
disclosure.  true, on his own account he cared very little about his
career; but he had wished to make it at least a respectable one on
account of his parents and brothers.  and now as he looked into the
candle its flame dumbly expressed to him that it was made to shine on
sensible people, and that it abhorred lighting the face of a dupe and
a failure.

in which he was obliged to
practise deception on his parents.  he almost talked to her in his
anger, as if she had been in the room.  and then her cooing voice,
plaintive in expostulation, disturbed the darkness, the velvet touch
of her lips passed over his brow, and he could distinguish in the air
the warmth of her breath.

this night the woman of his belittling deprecations was thinking how
great and good her husband was.  but over them both there hung a
deeper shade than the shade which angel clare perceived, namely, the
shade of his own limitations.  with all his attempted independence of
judgement this advanced and well-meaning young man, a sample product
of the last five-and-twenty years, was yet the slave to custom and
conventionality when surprised back into his early teachings.  no
prophet had told him, and he was not prophet enough to tell himself,
that essentially this young wife of his was as deserving of the
praise of king lemuel as any other woman endowed with the same
dislike

her moral value having to be reckoned not by
achievement but by tendency.  moreover, the figure near at hand
suffers on such occasion, because it shows up its sorriness without
shade; while vague figures afar off are honoured, in that their
distance makes artistic virtues of their stains.  in considering
what tess was not, he overlooked what she was, and forgot that the
defective can be more than the entire.

at breakfast brazil was the topic, and all endeavoured to take a
hopeful view of clare's proposed experiment with that country's soil,
notwithstanding the discouraging reports of some farm-labourers who
had emigrated thither and returned home within the twelve months.
after breakfast clare went into the little town to wind up such
trifling matters as he was concerned with there, and to get from
the local bank all the money he possessed.  on his way back he
encountered miss mercy chant by the church, from whose walls she
seemed to be a sort of emanation.  she was carrying an armfu

thers wrought beatific smiles upon her--an
enviable result, although, in the opinion of angel, it was obtained
by a curiously unnatural sacrifice of humanity to mysticism.

she had learnt that he was about to leave england, and observed what
an excellent and promising scheme it seemed to be.

"yes; it is a likely scheme enough in a commercial sense, no doubt,"
he replied.  "but, my dear mercy, it snaps the continuity of
existence.  perhaps a cloister would be preferable."

"a cloister!  o, angel clare!"

"well?"

"why, you wicked man, a cloister implies a monk, and a monk roman
catholicism."

"and roman catholicism sin, and sin damnation.  thou art in a parlous
state, angel clare."

"_i_ glory in my protestantism!" she said severely.

then clare, thrown by sheer misery into one of the demoniacal moods
in which a man does despite to his true principles, called her close
to him, and fiendishly whispered in her ear the most heterodox ideas
he could think of.  his momentary laughter at the horro

"dear mercy," he said, "you must forgive me.  i think i am going

she thought that he was; and thus the interview ended, and clare
re-entered the vicarage.  with the local banker he deposited the
jewels till happier days should arise.  he also paid into the bank
thirty pounds--to be sent to tess in a few months, as she might
require; and wrote to her at her parents' home in blackmoor vale to
inform her of what he had done.  this amount, with the sum he had
already placed in her hands--about fifty pounds--he hoped would be
amply sufficient for her wants just at present, particularly as in

behind.  it was under this roof that the deepest shadow ever thrown
upon his life had stretched its gloom over him.  yet when he had
unlocked the door of the sitting-room and looked into it, the memory
which returned first upon him was that of their happy arrival on a
similar afternoon, the first fresh sense of sharing a habitation
conjointly, the first meal together, the chatting by the fire with
joined hands.

the farmer and his wife were in the field at the moment of his visit,
and clare was in the rooms alone for some time.  inwardly swollen
with a renewal of sentiment that he had not quite reckoned with, he
went upstairs to her chamber, which had never been his.  the bed
was smooth as she had made it with her own hands on the morning of
leaving.  the mistletoe hung under the tester just as he had placed
it.  having been there three or four weeks it was turning colour, and
the leaves and berries were wrinkled.  angel took it down and crushed
it into the grate.  standing there,

time doubted
whether his course in this conjecture had been a wise, much less
a generous, one.  but had he not been cruelly blinded?  in the
incoherent multitude of his emotions he knelt down at the bedside
wet-eyed.  "o tess!  if you had only told me sooner, i would have
forgiven you!" he mourned.

hearing a footstep below, he rose and went to the top of the stairs.
at the bottom of the flight he saw a woman standing, and on her
turning up her face recognized the pale, dark-eyed izz huett.

"mr clare," she said, "i've called to see you and mrs clare, and to
inquire if ye be well.  i thought you might be back here again."

this was a girl whose secret he had guessed, but who had not yet
guessed his; an honest girl who loved him--one who would have made as
good, or nearly as good, a practical farmer's wife as tess.

"i am here alone," he said; "we are not living here now."  explaining
why he had come, he asked, "which way are you going home, izz?"

"i have no home at talbothays dairy now, sir

," she said.

"why is that?"

izz looked down.

"it was so dismal there that i left!  i am staying out this way."
she pointed in a contrary direction, the direction in which he was
journeying.

"well--are you going there now?  i can take you if you
wish for a lift."

her olive complexion grew richer in hue.

"thank 'ee, mr clare," she said.

he soon found the farmer, and settled the account for his rent and
the few other items which had to be considered by reason of the
sudden abandonment of the lodgings.  on clare's return to his horse
and gig, izz jumped up beside him.

"i am going to leave england, izz," he said, as they drove on.
"going to brazil."

"and do mrs clare like the notion of such a journey?" she asked.

"she is not going at present--say for a year or so.  i am going out

the good and sincere girl you have hitherto been; and think of me as
a worthless lover, but a faithful friend.  promise."

she gave the promise.

"heaven bless and keep you, sir.  goodbye!"

he drove on; but no sooner had izz turned into the lane, and clare
was out of sight, than she flung herself down on the bank in a fit of
racking anguish; and it was with a strained unnatural face that she
entered her mother's cottage late that night.  nobody ever was told
how izz spent the dark hours that intervened between angel clare's
parting from her and her arrival home.

clare, too, after bidding the girl farewell, was wrought to aching
thoughts and quivering lips.  but his sorrow was not for izz.  that
evening he was within a feather-weight's turn of ab

was right now.  and the momentum of the course on which he
had embarked tended to keep him going in it, unless diverted by
a stronger, more sustained force than had played upon him this
afternoon.  he could soon come back to her.  he took the train that
night for london, and five days after shook hands in farewell of his
brothers at the port of embarkation.

from the foregoing events of the winter-time let us press on to
an october day, more than eight months subsequent to the parting
of clare and tess.  we discover the latter in changed conditions;
instead of a bride with boxes and trunks which others bore, we see
her a lonely woman with a basket and a bundle in her own porterage,
as at an earlier time when she was no bride; instead of the ample
means that were projected by her husband for her comfort through
this probationary period, she can produce only a flattened purse.

had not met with a second regular engagement as at talbothays, but
had done duty as a supernumerary only.  however, as harvest was now
beginning, she had simply to remove from the pasture to the stubble
to find plenty of further occupation, and this continued till harvest
was done.

of the five-and-twenty pounds which had remained to her of clare's
allowance, after deducting the other half of the fifty as a
contribution to her parents for the trouble and expense to which
she had put them, she had as yet spent but little.  but there now
followed an unfortunate interval of wet weather, during which she was
obliged to fall back upon her sovereigns.

she could not bear to let them go.  angel had put them into her hand,
had obtained them bright and new from his bank for her; his touch had
consecrated them to souvenirs of himself--they appear

she was obliged to expend in winter clothing, leaving only a nominal
sum for the whole inclement season at hand.  when the last pound
had gone, a remark of angel's that whenever she required further
resources she was to apply to his father, remained to be considered.

but the more tess thought of the step, the more reluctant was she to
take it.  the same delicacy, pride, false shame, whatever it may be
called, on clare's account, which had led her to hide from her own
parents the prolongation of the estrangement, hindered her owning to
his that she was in want after the fair allowance he had left her.
they probably despised her already; how much more they would despise
her in the character of a mendicant!  the consequence was that by no
effort could the parson's daughter-in-law bring herself to let him
know her state.

her reluctance to communicate with her husband's parents might,
she thought, lessen with th

case that they would soon present a united front to their families
and the world.  this hope she still fostered.  to let her parents
know that she was a deserted wife, dependent, now that she had
relieved their necessities, on her own hands for a living, after the
_éclat_ of a marriage which was to nullify the collapse of the first
attempt, would be too much indeed.

the set of brilliants returned to her mind.  where clare had
deposited them she did not know, and it mattered little, if it were
true that she could only use and not sell them.  even were they
absolutely hers it would be passing mean to enrich herself by a legal
title to them which was not essentially hers at all.

meanwhile her husband's days had been by no means free from trial.

she rambled on--disconnecting herself by littles from her eventful
past at every step, obliterating her identity, giving no thought to
accidents or contingencies which might make a quick discovery of her
whereabouts by others of importance to her own happiness, if not to
theirs.

among the difficulties of her lonely position not the least was
the attention she excited by her appearance, a certain bearing of
distinction, which she had caught from clare, being superadded to her
natural attractiveness.  whilst the clothes lasted which had been
prepared for her marriage, these casual glances of interest caused
her no inconvenience, but as soon as she was compelled to don the
wrapper of a fieldwoman, rude words were addressed to her more than
once; but nothing occurred to cause her bodily fear till a particular
november afternoon.

farm for which she was now bound, because, for on

it was now broad day, and she started again, emerging cautiously upon
the highway.  but there was no need for caution; not a soul was at
hand, and tess went onward with fortitude, her recollection of the
birds' silent endurance of their night of agony impressing upon her
the relativity of sorrows and the tolerable nature of her own, if she
could once rise high enough to despise opinion.  but that she could
not do so long as it was held by clare.

she reached chalk-newton, and breakfasted at an inn, where several
young men were troublesomely complimentary to her good looks.
somehow she felt hopeful, for was it not possible that her husband
also might say these same things to her even yet?  she was bound to
take care of herself on the chance of it, and keep off these casual
lovers.  to this end tess resolved to run no further risks from her
appearance.  as soon as she got out of the village she entered a
thicket and took from her basket

ourn.  there seemed to be no help for it; hither she was doomed to
come.  the stubborn soil around her showed plainly enough that the
kind of labour in demand here was of the roughest kind; but it was
time to rest from searching, and she resolved to stay, particularly
as it began to rain.  at the entrance to the village was a cottage
whose gable jutted into the road, and before applying for a lodging
she stood under its shelter, and watched the evening close in.

"who would think i was mrs angel clare!" she said.

the wall felt warm to her back and shoulders, and she found that
immediately within the gable was the cottage fireplace, the heat of
which came through the bricks.  she warmed her hands upon them, and
also put her cheek--red and moist with the drizzle--against their
comforting surface.  the wall seemed to be the only friend she had.
she had so little wish to leave it that she could have stayed there
all night.

tess could hear the occupants of the cottage--gathered together after

and decidedly shabbier in attire.  at any previous period of her
existence tess would hardly have cared to renew the acquaintance in
such conditions; but her loneliness was excessive, and she responded
readily to marian's greeting.

marian was quite respectful in her inquiries, but seemed much moved
by the fact that tess should still continue in no better condition
than at first; though she had dimly heard of the separation.

"tess--mrs clare--the dear wife of dear he!  and is it really so bad
as this, my child?  why is your cwomely face tied up in such a way?

"no, no, no!  i merely did it not to be clipsed or colled, marian."

she pulled off in disgust a bandage which could suggest such wild
thoughts.

little white collar at the dairy).

must be something outside ye both."

"marian, dear marian, will you do me a good turn without asking
questions?  my husband has gone abroad, and somehow i have overrun my
allowance, so that i have to fall back upon my old work for a time.

"o yes; they'll take one always, because few care to come.  'tis a

here myself, i feel 'tis a pity for such as you to come."

"but you used to be as good a dairywoman as i."

"yes; but i've got out o' that since i took to drink.  lord, that's
the only comfort i've got now!  if you engage, you'll be set

still tess hoped.  she had a conviction that sooner or later the
magnanimity which she persisted in reckoning as a chief ingredient
of clare's character would lead him to rejoin her.

marian, primed to a humorous mood, would discover the queer-shaped
flints aforesaid, and shriek with laughter, tess remaining severely
obtuse.  they often looked across the country to where the var or
froom was know to stretch, even though they might not be able to see
it; and, fixing their eyes on the cloaking gray mist, imagined the
old times they had spent out there.

tess, between the amazons and the farmer, like a bird caught in a
clap-net, returned no answer, continuing to pull the straw.  she
could read character sufficiently well to know by this time that she
had nothing to fear from her employer's gallantry; it was rather the
tyranny induced by his mortification at clare's treatment of him.
upon the whole she preferred that sentiment in man and felt brave
enough to endure it.

"you thought i was in love with 'ee i suppose?  some women are such
fools, to take every look as serious earnest.  but there's nothing
like a winter afield for taking that nonsense out o' young wenches'
heads; and you've signed and agreed till lady-day.  now, are you

"i think you ought to beg mine."

sed off the last half-pint in their flagon, put down their hooks,
tied their last sheaves, and went away.  marian and izz would have
done likewise, but on hearing that tess meant to stay, to make up
by longer hours for her lack of skill, they would not leave her.
looking out at the snow, which still fell, marian exclaimed, "now,
we've got it all to ourselves."  and so at last the conversation
turned to their old experiences at the dairy; and, of course, the
incidents of their affection for angel clare.

"izz and marian," said mrs angel clare, with a dignity which was
extremely touching, seeing how very little of a wife she was: "i
can't join in talk with you now, as i used to do, about mr clare; you
will see that i cannot; because, although he is gone away from me for
the present, he is my husband."

izz was by nature the sauciest and most caustic of all the four girls
who had loved clare.  "he was a very splendid lover, no doubt," she
said; "but i don't think he is a too fond husband to go

neglectful in leaving everything to be done by him!"

the dim light in the barn grew dimmer, and they could see to work no
longer.  when tess had reached home that evening, and had entered
into the privacy of her little white-washed chamber, she began
impetuously writing a letter to clare.  but falling into doubt, she
could not finish it.  afterwards she took the ring from the ribbon on
which she wore it next her heart, and retained it on her finger all
night, as if to fortify herself in the sensation that she was really
the wife of this elusive lover of hers, who could propose that izz
should go with him abroad, so shortly after he had left her.  knowing
that, how could she write entreaties to him, or show that she cared
for him any more?

 her thoughts were led anew in the
direction which they had taken more than once of late--to the distant
emminster vicarage.  it was through her husband's parents that she
had been charged to send a letter to clare if she desired; and to
write to them direct if in difficulty.  but that sense of her having
morally no claim upon him had always led tess to suspend her impulse
to send these notes; and to the family at the vicarage, therefore,
as to her own parents since her marriage, she was virtually
non-existent.  this self-effacement in both directions had been quite
in consonance with her independent character of desiring nothing

marian and izz were much interested in her excursion, knowing that
the journey concerned her husband.  their lodgings were in a cottage
a little further along the lane, but they came and assisted tess
in her departure, and argued that she should dress up in her very
prettiest guise to captivate the hearts of her parents-in-law; though
she, knowing of the austere and calvinistic tenets of old mr clare,
was indifferent, and even doubtful.  a year had now elapsed since
her sad marriage, but she had preserved sufficient draperies from
the wreck of her then full wardrobe to clothe her very charmingly as
a simple country girl with no pretensions to recent fashion; a soft
gray woollen gown, with white crape quilling against the pink skin of
her face and neck, and a black velvet jacket and hat.

the less worthy feminine feelings of spite and rivalry.

with a final tug and touch here, and a slight brush there, they let
her go; and she was absorbed into the pearly air of the fore-dawn.
they heard her footsteps tap along the hard road as she stepped out
to her full pace.  even izz hoped she would win, and, though without
any particular respect for her own virtue, felt glad that she had
been prevented wronging her friend when momentarily tempted by clare.

it was a year ago, all but a day, that clare had married tess, and
only a few days less than a year that he had been absent from her.
still, to start on a brisk walk, and on such an errand as hers, on a
dry clear wintry morning, through the rarefied air of these chalky
hogs'-backs, was not depressing; and there is no doubt that her dream
at starting was to win the heart of her mother-in-law, tell her whole
history to that lady, enlist her on her side, and so gain back the
truant.

ng their discourse one of the clerical brothers probed the hedge
carefully with his umbrella, and dragged something to light.

"here's a pair of old boots," he said.  "thrown away, i suppose, by
some tramp or other."

"some imposter who wished to come into the town barefoot, perhaps,
and so excite our sympathies," said miss chant.  "yes, it must have
been, for they are excellent walking-boots--by no means worn out.
what a wicked thing to do!  i'll carry them home for some poor
person."

cuthbert clare, who had been the one to find them, picked them up for
her with the crook of his stick; and tess's boots were appropriated.

she, who had heard this, walked past under the screen of her woollen
veil till, presently looking back, she perceived that the church
party had left the gate with her boots and retreated down the hill.

thereupon our heroine resumed her walk.  tears, blinding tears, were
running down her face.  she knew that it was all sentiment, all
baseless impressibility, which had cau

then she grieved for the beloved man whose conventional standard of
judgement had caused her all these latter sorrows; and she went her
way without knowing that the greatest misfortune of her life was this
feminine loss of courage at the last and critical moment through her
estimating her father-in-law by his sons.  her present condition was
precisely one which would have enlisted the sympathies of old mr and
mrs clare.  their hearts went out of them at a bound towards extreme
cases, when the subtle mental troubles of the less desperate among
mankind failed to win their interest or regard.  in jumping at
publicans and sinners they would forget that a word might be said for
the worries of scribes and pharisees; and this defect or limitation
might have recommended their own daughter-in-law to them at this
moment as a fairly choice sort of lost person for their love.

conversion was brought about, and i hope you will be interested
enough at least to listen.  have you ever heard the name of the

he turned to a hunting-gate in the hedge and, without letting his
eyes again rest upon her, leapt over and struck out across the down
in the direction of abbot's-cernel.  as he walked his pace showed
perturbation, and by-and-by, as if instigated by a former thought,
he drew from his pocket a small book, between the leaves of which
was folded a letter, worn and soiled, as from much re-reading.
d'urberville opened the letter.  it was dated several months before
this time, and was signed by parson clare.

the letter began by expressing the writer's unfeigned joy at
d'urberville's conversion, and thanked him for his kindness in
communicating with the parson on the subject.  it expressed mr
clare's warm assurance of forgiveness for d'urberville's former
conduct and his interest in the young man's plans for the future.
he, mr clare, would much have liked to see d'urberville in the church
to whose ministry he had devoted so many years of his own life, and
would have helped him to enter a theologic

result if she had been free to accept the offer just made her of
being the monied alec's wife.  it would have lifted her completely
out of subjection, not only to her present oppressive employer, but
to a whole world who seemed to despise her.  "but no, no!" she said
breathlessly; "i could not have married him now!  he is so unpleasant
to me."

that very night she began an appealing letter to clare, concealing
from him her hardships, and assuring him of her undying affection.
any one who had been in a position to read between the lines would
have seen that at the back of her great love was some monstrous
fear--almost a desperation--as to some secret contingencies which
were not disclosed.  but again she did not finish her effusion; he
had asked izz to go with him, and perhaps he did not care for her at
all.  she put the letter in her box, and wondered if it would ever
reach angel's hands.

ut it," he said uneasily.

"i believe in the spirit of the sermon on the mount, and so did my
dear husband...  but i don't believe--"

here she gave her negations.

"the fact is," said d'urberville drily, "whatever your dear husband
believed you accept, and whatever he rejected you reject, without the
least inquiry or reasoning on your own part.  that's just like you
women.  your mind is enslaved to his."

"ah, because he knew everything!" said she, with a triumphant
simplicity of faith in angel clare that the most perfect man could
hardly have deserved, much less her husband.

"yes, but you should not take negative opinions wholesale from
another person like that.  a pretty fellow he must be to teach you
such scepticism!"

"he never forced my judgement!  he would never argue on the subject
with me!  but i looked at it in this way; what he believed, after
inquiring deep into doctrines, was much more likely to be right than
what i might believe, who hadn't looked into doctrines at all."

he clenched his lips, mortified with himself for his weakness.  his
eyes were equally barren of worldly and religious faith.  the corpses
of those old fitful passions which had lain inanimate amid the lines
of his face ever since his reformation seemed to wake and come
together as in a resurrection.  he went out indeterminately.

though d'urberville had declared that this breach of his engagement
to-day was the simple backsliding of a believer, tess's words, as
echoed from angel clare, had made a deep impression upon him, and
continued to do so after he had left her.  he moved on in silence, as
if his energies were benumbed by the hitherto undreamt-of possibility
that his position was untenable.  reason had had nothing to do with
his whimsical conversion, which was perhaps the mere freak of a
careless man in search of a new sensation, and temporarily impressed
by his mother's death.

failed her, and without heeding he added:

"well, this paradise that you supply is perhaps as good as any other,
after all.  but to speak seriously, tess."  d'urberville rose and
came nearer, reclining sideways amid the sheaves, and resting upon
his elbow.  "since i last saw you, i have been thinking of what
you said that he said.  i have come to the conclusion that there
does seem rather a want of common-sense in these threadbare old
propositions; how i could have been so fired by poor parson clare's
enthusiasm, and have gone so madly to work, transcending even him, i
cannot make out!  as for what you said last time, on the strength of
your wonderful husband's intelligence--whose name you have never told
me--about having what they call an ethical system without any dogma,
i don't see my way to that at all."

"why, you can have the religion of loving-kindness and purity at
least, if you can't have--what do you call it--dogma."

"o no!  i'm a different sort of fellow from that!  if there's

she tried to argue, and tell him that he had mixed in his dull
brain two matters, theology and morals, which in the primitive days
of mankind had been quite distinct.  but owing to angel clare's
reticence, to her absolute want of training, and to her being a
vessel of emotions rather than reasons, she could not get on.

"well, never mind," he resumed.  "here i am, my love, as in the old
times!"

"not as then--never as then--'tis different!" she entreated.  "and
there was never warmth with me!  o why didn't you keep your faith,

the soil so rich that the effort of growth requires but superficial
aid by comparison with the tillage at flintcomb-ash, and where to
tess the human world seemed so different (though it was much the
same).  it was purely for security that she had been requested by
angel to send her communications through his father, whom he kept
pretty well informed of his changing addresses in the country he
had gone to exploit for himself with a heavy heart.

"now," said old mr clare to his wife, when he had read the envelope,
"if angel proposes leaving rio for a visit home at the end of next
month, as he told us that he hoped to do, i think this may hasten his
plans; for i believe it to be from his wife."  he breathed deeply at
the thought of her; and the letter was redirected to be promptly sent
on to angel.

this was the only wail with which mrs clare ever disturbed her
husband's peace in respect to their sons.  and she did not vent this
often; for she was as considerate as she was devout, and knew that
his mind too was troubled by doubts as to his justice in this matter.
only too often had she heard him lying awake at night, stifling sighs
for angel with prayers.  but the uncompromising evangelical did not
even now hold that he would have been justified in giving his son,
an unbeliever, the same academic advantages that he had given to the

the stranger had sojourned in many more lands and among many more
peoples than angel; to his cosmopolitan mind such deviations from the
social norm, so immense to domesticity, were no more than are the
irregularities of vale and mountain-chain to the whole terrestrial
curve.  he viewed the matter in quite a different light from angel;
thought that what tess had been was of no importance beside what she
would be, and plainly told clare that he was wrong in coming away
from her.

the next day they were drenched in a thunder-storm. angel's companion
was struck down with fever, and died by the week's end.  clare waited
a few hours to bury him, and then went on his way.

the cursory remarks of the large-minded stranger, of whom he knew
absolutely nothing beyond a commonplace name, were sublimed by his
death, and influenced clare more than all the reasoned ethics of the
philosophers.  his own parochialism made him ashamed by its c

that his love and protection could possibly be withdrawn.

thus from being her critic he grew to be her advocate.  cynical
things he had uttered to himself about her; but no man can be always
a cynic and live; and he withdrew them.  the mistake of expressing
them had arisen from his allowing himself to be influenced by general
principles to the disregard of the particular instance.

but the reasoning is somewhat musty; lovers and husbands have gone
over the ground before to-day.  clare had been harsh towards her;
there is no doubt of it.  men are too often harsh with women they
love or have loved; women with men.  and yet these harshnesses are
tenderness itself when compared with the universal harshness out
of which they grow; the harshness of the position towards the
temperament, of the means towards the aims, of to-day towards
yesterday, of hereafter towards to-day.

had taken more notice of the tunes he played on his harp, that she
had inquired more curiously of him which were his favourite ballads
among those the country-girls sang.  she indirectly inquired of amby
seedling, who had followed izz from talbothays, and by chance amby
remembered that, amongst the snatches of melody in which they had
indulged at the dairyman's, to induce the cows to let down their
milk, clare had seemed to like "cupid's gardens", "i have parks, i
have hounds", and "the break o' the day"; and had seemed not to care
for "the tailor's breeches" and "such a beauty i did grow", excellent
ditties as they were.

to perfect the ballads was now her whimsical desire. she practised
them privately at odd moments, especially "the break o' the day":

undergoing a bracing process at the hands of sleep for renewed labour

hambledon hill.

at three she turned the last corner of the maze of lanes she had
threaded, and entered marlott, passing the field in which as a
club-girl she had first seen angel clare, when he had not danced
with her; the sense of disappointment remained with her yet.  in the
direction of her mother's house she saw a light.  it came from the
bedroom window, and a branch waved in front of it and made it wink at
her.  as soon as she could discern the outline of the house--newly
thatched with her money--it had all its old effect upon tess's
imagination.  part of her body and life it ever seemed to be; the

smockfrock who, she found, was forking the same plot as herself, and
whom she supposed her father had sent there to advance the work.
she became more conscious of him when the direction of his digging
brought him closer.  sometimes the smoke divided them; then it
swerved, and the two were visible to each other but divided from all
the rest.

with these words he rode off.  just at the corner of the street he
met the man with the paint-pot, who asked him if he had deserted the
brethren.

"you go to the devil!" said d'urberville.

tess remained where she was a long while, till a sudden rebellious
sense of injustice caused the region of her eyes to swell with the
rush of hot tears thither.  her husband, angel clare himself, had,
like others, dealt out hard measure to her; surely he had!  she had
never before admitted such a thought; but he had surely!  never
in her life--she could swear it from the bottom of her soul--had
she ever intended to do wrong; yet these hard judgements had
come.  whatever her sins, they were not sins of intention, but of
inadvertence, and why should she have been punished so persistently?

this was addressed to angel clare at the only place they had ever
heard him to be connected with, emminster vicarage; after which they
continued in a mood of emotional exaltation at their own generosity,
which made them sing in hysterical snatches and weep at the same
time.

it faced westward, and though gloom prevailed inside, there was still
light enough without to see with distinctness.  mrs clare, who had
been sitting in the drawing-room, followed him hither.

"plenty of time yet," said the vicar.  "he doesn't reach chalk-newton
till six, even if the train should be punctual, and ten miles of
country-road, five of them in crimmercrock lane, are not jogged over
in a hurry by our old horse."

"but he has done it in an hour with us, my dear."

"years ago."

thus they passed the minutes, each well knowing that this was only
waste of breath, the one essential being simply to wait.

 there was a slight noise in the lane, and the old
pony-chaise appeared indeed outside the railings.  they saw alight
therefrom a form which they affected to recognize, but would actually
have passed by in the street without identifying had he not got out
of their carriage at the particular moment when a particular person
was due.

mrs clare rushed through the dark passage to the door, and her
husband came more slowly after her.

the new arrival, who was just about to enter, saw their anxious faces
in the doorway and the gleam of the west in their spectacles because
they confronted the last rays of day; but they could only see his
shape against the light.

"o, my boy, my boy--home again at last!" cried mrs clare, who cared
no more at that moment for the stains of heterodoxy which had caused
all this separation than for the dust upo

where the candles were lighted she looked at his face.

"o, it is not angel--not my son--the angel who went away!" she cried
in all the irony of sorrow, as she turned herself aside.

his father, too, was shocked to see him, so reduced was that figure
from its former contours by worry and the bad season that clare had
experienced, in the climate to which he had so rashly hurried in his
first aversion to the mockery of events at home.  you could see the
skeleton behind the man, and almost the ghost behind the skeleton.
he matched crivelli's dead _christus_.  his sunken eye-pits were of
morbid hue, and the light in his eyes had waned.  the angular hollows

face twenty years before their time.

it was such a relief to clare to learn that tess was at least
apparently well that her mother's stiff reticence as to her
whereabouts did not long distress him.  they were all angry with him,
evidently.  he would wait till mrs durbeyfield could inform him of
tess's return, which her letter implied to be soon.  he deserved no
more.  his had been a love "which alters when it alteration finds".
he had undergone some strange experiences in his absence; he had seen

robates being their especial care, the tenderness towards
tess which her blood, her simplicity, even her poverty, had not
engendered, was instantly excited by her sin.

whilst he was hastily packing together a few articles for his journey
he glanced over a poor plain missive also lately come to hand--the
one from marian and izz huett, beginning--

"honour'd sir, look to your wife if you do love her as much as she do

in a quarter of an hour clare was leaving the house, whence his
mother watched his thin figure as it disappeared into the street.
he had declined to borrow his father's old mare, well knowing of
its necessity to the household.  he went to the inn, where he hired
a trap, and could hardly wait during the harnessing.  in a very few
minutes after, he was driving up the hill out of the town which,
three or four months earlier in the year, tess had descended with
such hopes and ascended with such shattered purposes.

their roots.

thence he went along the verge of the upland overhanging the other
hintocks, and, turning to the right, plunged into the bracing
calcareous region of flintcomb-ash, the address from which she had
written to him in one of the letters, and which he supposed to be
the place of sojourn referred to by her mother.  here, of course, he
did not find her; and what added to his depression was the discovery
that no "mrs clare" had ever been heard of by the cottagers or by
the farmer himself, though tess was remembered well enough by her
christian name.  his name she had obviously never used during their
separation, and her dignified sense of their total severance was
shown not much less by this abstention than by the hardships she had
chosen to undergo (of which he now learnt for the first time) rather
than apply to his father for more funds.

and it therefore became necessary to find mrs durbeyfield.  she had
told him she was not now at marlott, but had been curiously reticent
as to her actual address, and the only course was to go to marlott
and inquire for it.  the farmer who had been so churlish with tess
was quite smooth-tongued to clare, and lent him a horse and man to
drive him towards marlott, the gig he had arrived in being sent back
to emminster; for the limit of a day's journey with that horse was
reached.

clare would not accept the loan of the farmer's vehicle for a further
distance than to the outskirts of the vale, and, sending it back with
the man who had driven him, he put up at an inn, and next day entered
on foot the region wherein was the spot of his dear tess's birth.

an idiot.  they walked about the
garden paths with thoughts of their own concerns entirely uppermost,
bringing their actions at every moment in jarring collision with the
dim ghosts behind them, talking as though the time when tess lived
there were not one whit intenser in story than now.  even the spring
birds sang over their heads as if they thought there was nobody
missing in particular.

on inquiry of these precious innocents, to whom even the name of
their predecessors was a failing memory, clare learned that john
durbeyfield was dead; that his widow and children had left marlott,
declaring that they were going to live at kingsbere, but instead of
doing so had gone on to another place they mentioned.  by this time
clare abhorred the house for ceasing to contain tess, and hastened
away from its hated presence without once looking back.

his way was by the field in which he had first beheld her at the
dance.  it was as bad as the house--even worse.  he passed on through
the churchyard, wh

ere, amongst the new headstones, he saw one of a
somewhat superior design to the rest.  the inscription ran thus:

  the once powerful family of that name, and direct
  descendant through an illustrious line from sir pagan
  d'urberville, one of the knights of the conqueror.  died
  march 10th, 18--

                how are the mighty fallen.


some man, apparently the sexton, had observed clare standing there,
and drew nigh.  "ah, sir, now that's a man who didn't want to lie
here, but wished to be carried to kingsbere, where his ancestors be."

"and why didn't they respect his wish?"

"oh--no money.  bless your soul, sir, why--there, i wouldn't wish to
say it everywhere, but--even this headstone, for all the flourish
wrote upon en, is not paid for."

"ah, who put it up?"

the man told the name of a mason in the village, and, on leaving the
churchyard, clare called at the mason's house

statement was true, and paid the bill.  this done, he turned in the
direction of the migrants.

the distance was too long for a walk, but clare felt such a strong
desire for isolation that at first he would neither hire a conveyance
nor go to a circuitous line of railway by which he might eventually
reach the place.  at shaston, however, he found he must hire; but
the way was such that he did not enter joan's place till about seven
o'clock in the evening, having traversed a distance of over twenty
miles since leaving marlott.

the village being small he had little difficulty in finding mrs
durbeyfield's tenement, which was a house in a

remote from the main road, where she had stowed away her clumsy old
furniture as best she could.  it was plain that for some reason or
other she had not wished him to visit her, and he felt his call to
be somewhat of an intrusion.  she came to the door herself, and the
light from the evening sky fell upon her face.

this was the first time that clare had ever met her, but he was too
preoccupied to observe more than that she was still a handsome woman,
in the garb of a respectable widow.  he was obliged to explain that
he was tess's husband, and his object in coming there, and he did it
awkwardly enough.  "i want to see her at once," he added.  "you said
you would write to me again, but you have not done so."

"because she've not come home," said joan.

"do you know if she is well?"

"i don't.  but you ought to, sir," said she.

a low voice--

"she is at sandbourne."

"ah--where there?  sandbourne has become a large place, they say."

"i don't know more particularly than i have said--sandbourne.  for
myself, i was never there."

it was apparent that joan spoke the truth in this, and he pressed her
no further.

"are you in want of anything?" he said gently.

"no, sir," she replied.  "we are fairly well provided for."

without entering the house clare turned away.  there was a station
three miles ahead, and paying off his coachman, he walked thither.
the last train to sandbourne left shortly after, and it bore clare
on its wheels.

at eleven o'clock that night, having secured a bed at one of the
hotels and telegraphed his address to his father immediately on his
arrival, he walked out into the streets of sandbourne.  it was too
late to call on or inquire for any one, and he reluctantly postponed
his purpose till the morning.  but he c

this fashionable watering-place, with its eastern and its western
stations, its piers, its groves of pines, its promenades, and its

created by the stroke of a wand, and allowed to get a little dusty.
an outlying eastern tract of the enormous egdon waste was close at
hand, yet on the very verge of that tawny piece of antiquity such a
glittering novelty as this pleasure city had chosen to spring up.

he might almost as well have sat up all night.  in the morning he
arose at seven, and shortly after went out, taking the direction of
the chief post-office.  at the door he met an intelligent postman
coming out with letters for the morning delivery.

"do you know the address of a mrs clare?" asked angel.  the postman
shook his head.

then, remembering that she would have been likely to continue the use
of her maiden name, clare said--

"of a miss durbeyfield?"

"durbeyfield?"

this also was strange to the postman addressed.

"there's visitors coming and going every day, as you know, sir," he
said; "and without the name of the house 'tis impossible to find
'em."

one of his comrades hastening out at that moment, the name was
repeated to him.

"i know no name of durbeyfield; but th

"that's it!" cried clare, pleased to think that she had reverted to
the real pronunciation.  "what place is the herons?"

"a stylish lodging-house.  'tis all lodging-houses here, bless 'ee."

clare received directions how to find the house, and hastened
thither, arriving with the milkman.  the herons, though an ordinary
villa, stood in its own grounds, and was certainly the last place
in which one would have expected to find lodgings, so private was
its appearance.  if poor tess was a servant here, as he feared, she

the hour being early, the landlady herself opened the door.  clare
inquired for teresa d'urberville or durbeyfield.

"mrs d'urberville?"

"yes."

tess, then, passed as a married woman, and he felt glad, even though
she had not adopted his name.

"will you kindly tell her that a relative is anxious to see her?"

"it is rather early.  what name shall i give, sir?"

"angel."

"mr angel?"

"no; angel.  it is my christian name.  she'll understand."

would not come again; and you have come!  these clothes are what he's
put upon me: i didn't care what he did wi' me!  but--will you go
away, angel, please, and never come any more?"

they stood fixed, their baffled hearts looking out of their eyes with
a joylessness pitiful to see.  both seemed to implore something to
shelter them from reality.

"ah--it is my fault!" said clare.

but he could not get on.  speech was as inexpressive as silence.  but
he had a vague consciousness of one thing, though it was not clear
to him till later; that his original tess had spiritually ceased to
recognize the body before him as hers--allowing it to drift, like a
corpse upon the current, in a direction dissociated from its living
will.

a few instants passed, and he found that tess was gone.  his face
grew colder and more shrunken as he stood concentrated on the moment,

mrs brooks, the lady who was the householder at the herons and owner
of all the handsome furniture, was not a person of an unusually
curious turn of mind. she was too deeply materialized, poor woman,
by her long and enforced bondage to that arithmetical demon
profit-and-loss, to retain much curiousity for its own sake, and
apart from possible lodgers' pockets.  nevertheless, the visit of
angel clare to her well-paying tenants, mr and mrs d'urberville, as
she deemed them, was sufficiently exceptional in point of time and
manner to reinvigorate the feminine proclivity which had been stifled
down as useless save in its bearings to the letting trade.

tess had spoken to her husband from the doorway, without entering
the dining-room, and mrs brooks, who stood within the partly-closed
door of her own sitting-room at the back of the passage, could
hear fragments of the conversation--if conversati

the stairs to the first floor, and the departure of clare, and the
closing of the front door behind him.  then the door of the room
above was shut, and mrs brooks knew that tess had re-entered her
apartment.  as the young lady was not fully dressed, mrs brooks knew
that she would not emerge again for some time.

she accordingly ascended the stairs softly, and stood at the door of
the front room--a drawing-room, connected with the room immediately
behind it (which was a bedroom) by folding-doors in the common
manner.  this first floor, containing mrs b

visitor to the town had been stabbed in his bed, spread through every
street and villa of the popular watering-place.

meanwhile angel clare had walked automatically along the way by which
he had come, and, entering his hotel, sat down over the breakfast,
staring at nothingness.  he went on eating and drinking unconsciously
till on a sudden he demanded his bill; having paid which, he took his
dressing-bag in his hand, the only luggage he had brought with him,
and went out.

at the moment of his departure a telegram was handed to him--a few
words from his mother, stating that they were glad to know his
address, and informing him that

to edge.  he had traversed the greater part of this depression, and
was climbing the western acclivity when, pausing for breath, he
unconsciously looked back.  why he did so he could not say, but
something seemed to impel him to the act.  the tape-like surface of
the road diminished in his rear as far as he could see, and as he
gazed a moving spot intruded on the white vacuity of its perspective.

it was a human figure running.  clare waited, with a dim sense that
somebody was trying to overtake him.

the form descending the incline was a woman's, yet so entirely was
his mind blinded to the idea of his wife's following him that even
when she came nearer he did not recognize her under the totally
changed attire in which he now beheld her.  it was not till she was
quite close that he could believe her to be tess.

spoke, her mind had lost its balance, and plunged her into this
abyss.

it was very terrible if true; if a temporary hallucination, sad.  but,
anyhow, here was this deserted wife of his, this passionately-fond
woman, clinging to him without a suspicion that he would be anything
to her but a protector.  he saw that for him to be otherwise was
not, in her mind, within the region of the possible.  tenderness was
absolutely dominant in clare at last.  he kissed her endlessly with
his white lips, and held her hand, and said--

"i will not desert you!  i will protect you by every means in my
power, dearest love, whatever you may have done or not have done!"

they then walked on under the trees, tess turning her head every now
and then to look at him.  worn and unhandsome as he had become, it
was plain that she did not discern the least fault in his appearance.
to her he was, as of old, all that was perfection, personally and

they sat down upon some dead boughs and shared their meal.  between
one and two o'clock they packed up the remainder and went on again.

"i feel strong enough to walk any distance," said she.

"i think we may as well steer in a general way towards the interior
of the country, where we can hide for a time, and are less likely to
be looked for than anywhere near the coast," clare remarked.  "later
on, when they have forgotten us, we can make for some port."

she made no reply to this beyond that of grasping him more tightly,
and straight inland they went.  though the season was an english may,
the weather was serenely bright, and during the afternoon it was
quite warm.  through the latter miles of their walk their footpath
had taken them into the depths of the new forest, and towards
evening, turning the corner of a lane, they perceived behind a brook
and bridge a large

 board on which was painted in white letters, "this
desirable mansion to be let furnished"; particulars following, with
directions to apply to some london agents.  passing through the gate
they could see the house, an old brick building of regular design and
large accommodation.

"i know it," said clare.  "it is bramshurst court.  you can see that
it is shut up, and grass is growing on the drive."

"some of the windows are open," said tess.

"just to air the rooms, i suppose."

"all these rooms empty, and we without a roof to our heads!"

"you are getting tired, my tess!" he said.  "we'll stop soon."  and
kissing her sad mouth, he again led her onwards.

he was growing weary likewise, for they had wandered a dozen or

dragged, and they stood still.

"could we sleep under the trees?" she asked.

he thought the season insufficiently advanced.

"i have been thinking of that empty mansion we passed," he said.
"let us go back towards it again."

they retraced their steps, but it was half an hour before they stood
without the entrance-gate as earlier.  he then requested her to stay
where she was, whilst he went to see who was within.

she sat down among the bushes within the gate, and clare crept
towards the house.  his absence lasted some considerable time, and
when he returned tess was wildly anxious, not for herself, but for
him.  he had found out from a boy that there was only an old woman in
charge as caretaker, and she only came there on fine days, from the
hamlet near, to open and shut the windows.  she would come to shut
them at sunset.  "now, we can get in through one of the lower
windows, and rest there," said he.

under his escort she went tardily forward to the main fr

they remained in great quietness till the caretaker should have come
to shut the windows: as a precaution, putting themselves in total
darkness by barring the shutters as before, lest the woman should
open the door of their chamber for any casual reason.  between six
and seven o'clock she came, but did not approach the wing they
were in.  they heard her close the windows, fasten them, lock the
door, and go away.  then clare again stole a chink of light from
the window, and they shared another meal, till by-and-by they
were enveloped in the shades of night which they had no candle to
disperse.

the night was strangely solemn and still.  in the small hours she

both their lives, and laid her down in the stone coffin at the ruined

her first indignation at the effrontery of tramps and vagabonds gave
way to a momentary sentimentality over this genteel elopement, as it
seemed.  she closed the door, and withdrew as softly as she had come,
to go and consult with her neighbours on the odd discovery.

not more than a minute had elapsed after her withdrawal when tess
woke, and then clare.  both had a sense that something had disturbed
them, though they could not say what; and the uneasy feeling which
it engendered grew stronger.  as soon as he was dressed he narrowly
scanned the lawn through the two or three inches of shutter-chink.

"i think we will leave at once," said he.  "it is a fine day. and i

having thus persuaded her, the plan was pursued, and they kept a
bee-line northward.  their long repose at the manor-house lent them
walking power now; and towards mid-day they found that they were
approaching the steepled city of melchester, which lay directly in
their way.  he decided to rest her in a clump of trees during the
afternoon, and push onward under cover of darkness.  at dusk clare
purchased food as usual, and their night march began, the boundary
between upper and mid-wessex being crossed about eight o'clock.

to walk across country without much regard to roads was not new

through in order to take advantage of the town bridge for crossing a
large river that obstructed them.  it was about midnight when they

oon had hitherto helped them a little.  but the moon
had now sunk, the clouds seemed to settle almost on their heads, and
the night grew as dark as a cave.  however, they found their way
along, keeping as much on the turf as possible that their tread might
not resound, which it was easy to do, there being no hedge or fence
of any kind.  all around was open loneliness and black solitude, over
which a stiff breeze blew.

they had proceeded thus gropingly two or three miles further when
on a sudden clare became conscious of some vast erection close in
his front, rising sheer from the grass.  they had almost struck
themselves against it.

"what monstrous place is this?" said angel.

"it hums," said she.  "hearken!"

he listened.  the wind, playing upon the edifice, produced a booming
tune, like the note of some gigantic one-stringed harp.  no other
sound came from it, and lifting his hand and advancing a step or
two, clare felt the vertical surface of the structure.  it seemed to
be of solid sto

place was all doors and pillars, some connected above by continuous
architraves.

"a very temple of the winds," he said.

the next pillar was isolated; others composed a trilithon; others
were prostrate, their flanks forming a causeway wide enough for a
carriage; and it was soon obvious that they made up a forest of
monoliths grouped upon the grassy expanse of the plain.  the couple
advanced further into this pavilion of the night till they stood in
its midst.

"it is stonehenge!" said clare.

"the heathen temple, you mean?"

"yes.  older than the centuries; older than the d'urbervilles!  well,
what shall we do, darling?  we may find shelter further on."

but tess, really tired by this time, flung herself upon an oblong
slab that lay close at hand, and was sheltered from the wind by a
pillar.  owing to the action of the sun during the preceding day, the
stone was warm and dry, in comforting contrast to the rough and chill
grass around, which had damped her skirts and shoes.

the eastward pillars and their architraves stood up blackly against
the light, and the great flame-shaped sun-stone beyond them; and the
stone of sacrifice midway.  presently the night wind died out, and
the quivering little pools in the cup-like hollows of the stones lay
still.  at the same time something seemed to move on the verge of the
dip eastward--a mere dot.  it was the head of a man approaching them
from the hollow beyond the sun-stone.  clare wished they had gone
onward, but in the circumstances decided to remain quiet.  the figure
came straight towards the circle of pillars in which they were.

he heard something behind him, the brush of feet.  turning, he saw
over the prostrate columns another figure; then before he was aware,
another was at hand on the right, under a trilithon, and another on
the left.  the dawn shone full on the front of the man westward, and
clare could discern from this that he was tall, and walked as if

e walking rapidly,
as if unconscious of the trying ascent--unconscious through
preoccupation and not through buoyancy.  they had emerged upon this
road through a narrow, barred wicket in a high wall a little lower
down.  they seemed anxious to get out of the sight of the houses and
of their kind, and this road appeared to offer the quickest means
of doing so.  though they were young, they walked with bowed heads,
which gait of grief the sun's rays smiled on pitilessly.

one of the pair was angel clare, the other a tall budding
creature--half girl, half woman--a spiritualized image of tess,
slighter than she, but with the same beautiful eyes--clare's
sister-in-law, 'liza-lu.  their pale faces seemed to have shrunk
to half their natural size.  they moved on hand in hand, and never
spoke a word, the drooping of their heads being that of giotto's
"two apostles".

when they had nearly reached the top of the great west hill the
clocks in the town struck eight.  each gave a start at the notes,
