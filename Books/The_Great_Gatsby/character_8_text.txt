don s. schwartze (the son) and arthur mccarty, all connected with the movies in one way or another. and the catlips and the bembergs and g. earl muldoon, brother to that muldoon who afterward strangled his wife. da fontano the promoter came there, and ed legros and james b. ("rot-gut") ferret and the de jongs and ernest lilly--they came to gamble and when ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and associated traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day.

a man named klipspringer was there so often and so long that he became known as "the boarder"--i doubt if he had any other home. of theatrical people there were gus waize and horace o'donavan and lester meyer and george duckweed and francis bull. also from new york were the chromes and the backhyssons and the dennickers and russel betty and the corrigans and the kellehers and the dewars and the scullys and s. w. belcher and the smirkes and the young quinns, divorced now, and henry l. palmetto who killed himself by jump

 and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through. as gatsby closed the door of "the merton college library" i could have sworn i heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter.

we went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunken baths--intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pajamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. it was mr. klipspringer, the "boarder." i had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning. finally we came to gatsby's own apartment, a bedroom and a bath and an adam study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.

he hadn't once ceased looking at daisy and i think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes. sometimes, too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way as though in her a

 off.

"come here quick!" cried daisy at the window.

the rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.

"look at that," she whispered, and then after a moment: "i'd like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around."

i tried to go then, but they wouldn't hear of it; perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone.

"i know what we'll do," said gatsby, "we'll have klipspringer play the piano."

he went out of the room calling "ewing!" and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blonde hair. he was now decently clothed in a "sport shirt" open at the neck, sneakers and duck trousers of a nebulous hue.

"did we interrupt your exercises?" inquired daisy politely.

"i was asleep," cried mr. klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment. "that is, i'd been asleep. then i got up. . . ."

"klipspringer

off. "don't you, ewing, old sport?"

"i don't play well. i don't--i hardly play at all. i'm all out of prac----"

"we'll go downstairs," interrupted gatsby. he flipped a switch. the grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.

in the music room gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. he lit daisy's cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on a couch far across the room where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall.

when klipspringer had played "the love nest" he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for gatsby in the gloom.

"i'm all out of practice, you see. i told you i couldn't play. i'm all out of prac----"

"don't talk so much, old sport," commanded gatsby. "play!"

in the morning,
in the evening,
  ain't we got fun----

outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the sound. all the lights were going on in west egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through

he touched his head impressively and i nodded.

"if he'd of lived he'd of been a great man. a man like james j. hill. he'd of helped build up the country."

"that's true," i said, uncomfortably.

he fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the bed, and lay down stiffly--was instantly asleep.

that night an obviously frightened person called up and demanded to know who i was before he would give his name.

"this is mr. carraway," i said.

"oh--" he sounded relieved. "this is klipspringer."

i was relieved too for that seemed to promise another friend at gatsby's grave. i didn't want it to be in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd so i'd been calling up a few people myself. they were hard to find.

"the funeral's tomorrow," i said. "three o'clock, here at the house. i wish you'd tell anybody who'd be interested."

"oh, i will," he broke out hastily. "of course i'm not likely to see anybody, but if i do."

his tone made me suspicious.

"of course you'll be there yourself."
