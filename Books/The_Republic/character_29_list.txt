Understanding - 
                 Understanding
is the highest grade of cognitive activity. Understanding involves
the use of pure, abstract reason, and does not rely on the crutches
of images and unproven assumptions. Understanding is only achieved
once the Form of the Good is grasped. See also Belief, Imagination,
Thought.
