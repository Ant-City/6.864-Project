ations of the quantum world on short distance scales. on ultramicroscopic scales, the central
feature of quantum mechanics—the uncertainty principle—is in direct conflict with the central feature
of general relativity—the smooth geometrical model of space (and of spacetime).

figure  5.1  by  sequentially  magnifying  a  region  of  space,  its  ultramicroscopic  properties  can  be
probed.  attempts  to  merge  general  relativity  and  quantum  mechanics  run  up  against  the  violent
quantum foam emerging at the highest level of magnification.

in practice, this conflict rears its head in a very concrete manner. calculations that merge the
equations  of  general  relativity  and  those  of  quantum  mechanics  typically  yield  one  and  the  same
ridiculous answer: infinity. like a sharp rap on the wrist from an old-time schoolteacher, an infinite
answer is nature's way of telling us that we are doing something that is quite wrong.6 the equations of
general relativity cannot handle the

notice,  however,  that  as  we  recede  to  more  ordinary  distances  (following  the  sequence  of
drawings in figure 5.1 in reverse), the random, violent small-scale undulations cancel each other out
—in  much  the  same  way  that,  on  average,  our  compulsive  borrower's  bank  account  shows  no
evidence of his compulsion—and the concept of a smooth geometry for the fabric of the universe once
again becomes accurate. it's like what you experience when you look at a dot-matrix pic
