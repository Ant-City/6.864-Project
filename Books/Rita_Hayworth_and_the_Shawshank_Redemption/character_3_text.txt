n eye on us, because the south
wall sentry post was close enough so that the fellows up there could have spit
their chews on us, if they'd wanted to. if anyone on the roof-sealing party had
made one funny move, it would take four seconds to cut him smack in two with
.45-caliber machine-gun bullets. so those screws just sat there and took their
ease. all they needed was a couple of six-packs buried in crushed ice, and they
would have been the lords of all creation.
one of them was a fellow named byron hadley, and in that year of 1950, he'd been 
26
at shawshank longer than i had. longer than the last two wardens put together,
as a matter of fact. the fellow running the show in 1950 was a prissy-looking
down-east yankee named george dunahy. he had a degree in penal administration.
no one liked him, as far as i could tell, except the people who had gotten him his
appointment. i heard that he was only interested in three things: compiling
statistics for a book (which was later published by a small new

called light side press, where he probably had to pay to have it done), which
team won the intramural baseball championship each september, and getting a
death-penalty law passed in maine. a regular bear for the death penalty was
george dunahy. he was fired from the job in 1953, when it came out he was
running a discount auto-repair service down in the prison garage and splitting
the profits with byron hadley and greg stammas. hadley and stammas came out of
that one okay-they were old hands at keeping their asses covered-but dunahy took
a walk. no one was sorry to see him go, but nobody was exactly pleased to see
greg stammas step into his shoes, either. he was a short man with a tight, hard
gut and the coldest brown eyes you ever saw. he always had a painful, pursed
little grin on his face, as if he had to go to the bathroom and couldn't quite
manage it. during stammas's tenure as warden there was

shawshank, and although i have no proof, i believe there were maybe half a dozen
moonlight burials in the stand of scrub forest that lies east of the prison.
dunahy was bad, but greg stammas was a cruel, wretched, cold-hearted man.
he and byron hadley were good friends. as warden, george dunahy was nothing but
a posturing figurehead; it was stammas, and through him, hadley, who actually
administered the prison.
hadley was a tall, shambling man with thinning red hair. he sunburned easily
and he talked loud and if you didn't move fast enough to suit him, he'd clout you
with his stick. on that day, our third on the roof, he was talking to another
guard named mert entwhistle.
hadley had gotten some amazingly good news, so he was griping about it

gainst him. the world had cheated him out of
the best years of his life, and the world would be more than happy to cheat him
out of the rest. i have seen some screws that i thought were almost saintly, and
i think i know why that happens -- they are able to see the difference between
their own lives, poor and struggling as they might be, and the lives of the men
they are paid by the state to watch over. these guards are able to formulate a
comparison concerning pain. others can't, or won't.
for byron hadley there was no basis of comparison. he could sit there, cool and
at his ease under the warm may sun, and find the gall to mourn his own good luck
while less than ten feet away a bunch of men were working and sweating and
burning their hands on great big buckets filled with bubbling tar, men who had

this paragon of gratitude on the plate-shop roof said). the money had come as a
result of oil and oil-leases, and there was close to a million dollars.
no, hadley wasn't a millionaire-that might have made even him happy, at least
for awhile-but the brother had left a pretty damned decent bequest of
thirty-five thousand dollars to each surviving member of his family back in
maine, if they could be found. not bad. like getting lucky and winning a
sweepstakes.
but to byron hadley the glass was always half empty. he spent most of the
morning bitching to mert about the bite that the goddam government was going to
take out of his windfall. "they'll leave me about enough to buy a new car with,"
he allowed, "and then what happens? you have to pay the damn taxes on the car,
and the repairs and maintenance, you got your goddam kids pestering you to take
'em for a ride with the top down-"
"and to drive it, if they're old enough," mert said. old mert entwhistle knew

over the side. terrible accident. dufresne, prisoner 81433-shnk, was taking a
couple of empties down and slipped on the ladder. too bad.
they laid hold of him, mert on the right arm, hadley on the left. andy didn't
resist. his eyes never left hadley's red face.
"if you've got your thumb on her, mr. hadley," he said in that same calm,
composed voice, "there's not a reason why you shouldn't have every cent of that
money. final score, mr. byron hadley thirty-five thousand, uncle sam zip."
mert started to drag him toward the edge.
hadley just stood there. for a moment andy was like a rope between them in a tug-of-war
game. then hadley said, "hold on one second, mert. what do you mean, boy?"
"i mean, if you've got your thumb on your wife, you can give it to her," andy
said.
"you better start making sense, boy, or you're going over."
"the irs allows you a one-time-only gift to your spouse," andy said. "it's good
up to sixty thousand dollars."

"i think you're lying," hadley said, but he didn't-you could see he didn't.
there was an emotion dawning on his face, something that was grotesque overlying
that long, ugly countenance and that receding, sunburned brow. an almost obscene
emotion when seen on the features of byron hadley. it was hope.
"no, i'm not lying. there's no reason why you should take my word for it,
either. engage a lawyer-"
"ambulance-chasing highway-robbing sob’s!" hadley cried.
andy shrugged. "then go to the irs. they'll tell you the same thing for free.
actually, you don't need me to tell you at all. you would have investigated the
matter for yourself."
"you’re right. i don't need any smart wife-killing banker to show me where the
bears go in the woods."

spoil it. it lasted twenty minutes, that beer-break, and for those twenty
minutes we felt like free men. we could have been drinking beer and tarring the
roof of one of our own houses.
only andy didn't drink. i already told you about his drinking habits. he sat
hunkered down in the shade, hands dangling between his knees, watching us and
smiling a little. it's amazing how many men remember him that way, and amazing
how many men were on that work-crew when andy dufresne faced down byron hadley.
i thought there were nine or ten of us, but by 1955 there must have been two
hundred of us, maybe more . . . if you believed what you heard.
so, yeah-if you asked me to give you a flat-out answer to the question of
whether i'm trying to tell you about a man or a legend that got made up around
the man, like a pearl around a little piece of grit-i'd have to say that the
answer lies somewhere in between. all i know for sure is that andy dufresne

job, they wouldn't even give him a library card. i heard he died in a home for
indigent old folks up freeport way in 1953, and at that he lasted about six
months longer than i thought he would. yeah, i guess the state got its own back
on brooksie, all right. they trained him to like it inside the shithouse and
then they threw him out.
andy succeeded to brooksie's job, and he was librarian for twenty-three years.
he used the same force of will i'd seen him use on byron hadley to get what he
wanted for the library, and i saw him gradually turn one small room (which still
smelled of turpentine because it had been a paint closet until 1922 and had
never been properly aired) lined with reader's digest condensed books and
national geographies into the best prison library in new england.
he did it a step at a time. he put a suggestion box by the door and patiently
weeded out such attempts at humor as more fuk-boox pleeze and excape in 10 ez

stammas went early in 1959. there had been several investigative reporters
sniffing around, and one of them even did four months under an assumed name, for
a crime made up out of whole cloth. they were getting ready to drag out
scandal and nest-feathering again, but before they could bring the hammer
down on him, stammas ran. i can understand that; boy, can i ever. if he had been tried
and convicted, he could have ended up right in here. if so, he might have lasted all
of five hours. byron hadley had gone two years earlier. the sucker had a heart
attack and took an early retirement.
andy never got touched by the stammas affair. in early 1959 a new warden was
appointed, and a new assistant warden, and a new chief of guards. for the next
eight months or so, andy was just another con again. it was during that period
that normaden, the big half-breed passamaquoddy, shared andy's cell with him.
then everything just started up again. normaden was moved out, and andy was

"yes," he said finally. "that's the damnedest story i ever heard. but i'll tell

a game out of it. how far in can i get before they find out? prison
is a goddam boring place, and the chance of being surprised by an unscheduled
inspection in the middle of the night while he had his poster unstuck probably
added some spice to his life during the early years.
and i do believe it would have been impossible for him to get away with it just
on dumb luck. not for twenty-seven years. nevertheless, i have to believe that
for the first two years- until mid-may of 1950, when he helped byron hadley get
around the tax on his windfall inheritance-that's exactly what he did get by on.
or maybe he had something more than dumb luck going for him even back then. he
had money, and he might have been slipping someone a little squeeze every week
to take it easy on him. most guards will go along with that if the price is
right; it's money in their pockets and the prisoner gets to keep his whack off
pictures or his tailor made cigarettes. also, andy was a model prisoner- quiet,
