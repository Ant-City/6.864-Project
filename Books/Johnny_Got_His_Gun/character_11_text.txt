d loaves. the boys looked at him as he went. he remembered their
faces floating by him as he moved toward the telephone. dutch and little dutch and
whitey who took shots in his spine and pablo and rudy and all the boys. they looked at
him curiously as he passed them. maybe that was because he was scared inside and
showed it outside. he got to the phone.
"hello."
"hello son. come on home now."
"all right mother i'll be right there."
he went into the lean-to office with the wide glass front where jody simmons the
night foreman kept a close watch on his crew.
"jody i got to go home. my father just died."
"died? gosh kid that's too bad. sure kid you run along. rudy. hey rudy. grab a
truck and drive joe home. his old â€”his father just died. sure kid go on home. i'll have
one of the boys punch you out. that's tough kid. go home."
rudy stepped on it. it was raining outside because it was december and los angeles
just before christmas. the tires sizzled against the wet pavement as they went. it was the

to stick to them. their stories were
their only excuse for being what they were so in time the guys at the bakery came to
accept the stories told by the guys from the mission and to say nothing. so after jose got
through with his talking they grunted and went back to work again.
next week was easter and that meant hot cross buns and that meant there would
have to be lots of extra help because the shipping crew couldn't put out twenty or thirty
thousand dozen hot cross buns without extra men. so jody simmons offered jose a job
for the week and jose took it. he was such a good worker on hot cross buns that when
larruping larry quit jose got larry's job. he was very grateful and very quiet. he was
also pleased that the weather was warmer. he was sleeping in the park and that was a
wonderful thing. you saved money and jose needed money for clothes. a man who is
going to work in the studios must be well dressed said jose.
then one day jose came in with a letter. he was very puzzled. he showed it to the

o one and got what
he wanted.
how did you get this job jose? i asked for it said jose. oh said the guys at the
bakery. then they sat around and stared at him some more. finally somebody spoke up
and said jose what's all this about a problem and why are you so worried?
jose looked surprised. anybody should know that he said. he had come to california
and he had been without money and he had been full of disinfectant from the midnight
mission and he had been very unhappy. then this nice gentleman jody simmons had
accepted him into the bakery and given him a fine job. that made him indebted to jody
simmons no? very well. he was indebted to jody simmons and now he had found a job.
how was he to get out of the job jody simmons had given him in order to take the new
job without offending his benefactor?
all the guys began to get excited. each one had a different speech he would tell jody
simmons to get out of the job. one guy thought a good way to do was to punch jody
simmons right smack in the snoot. a

nother guy said just to walk in politely and tell jody
simmons to shove the job up his ass. another one said just not to show up for work
tomorrow and jody simmons would catch on real quick. and there were several other
ways the guys at the bakery could think of. there ought to have been. they'd been
thinking of them for years. a lot of talent had gone to waste thinking of ways to tell jody
simmons you were quitting. here was a guy who was actually going to do it so naturally
everyone cooperated.
but when all of the solutions had been offered to him jose shook his head and his
eyes looked sadder than ever. he said no he must think of a better way. it woul

d not be
gentlemanly to resign in any of the ways suggested. jody simmons was his benefactor
and one did not do such things to one's benefactor. even if it were an american custom to
do it differently still he would have to follow the customs of his native porto rico and in
porto rico one did not do such things if one were well born.
when you start work on this job jose? this morning said jose and i am very tired
and now i am going to have to work all night and that will make me much tireder in the
morning for the other job and so it will go and it is a terrible prob

think violence will work i
will use it. he thought a little more and then said i can pay for these pies i have violated
yes? everybody said yes if he wanted to be a fool he could pay for the pies he violated.
so that night about two or three o'clock jose took six pies and stationed himself in
the direct line of jody's vision outside the window of jody's lean-to office. all the guys
were close around looking as if they were working but really watching jose. they were
watching for the minute when jody simmons would look out through that window from
his desk. when he looked pinky was to give a signal and then jose would dump the pies.
it seemed that it took jody longer to look out that window than it ever had before. but
finally he did and pinky carson gave the signal and jose dropped the pies.
jody came zipping out of his office like a bumblebee. he said what the hell is the
matter with you you clumsy bastard you turned all these pies over. they're ruined and
you'll have to pay for them. poor jose s

tood there almost melting with sadness. he turned
his big eyes on jody simmons and he said i am so sorry mister simmons that i have
violated pies. it was an accident i assure you and only a poor workman would have done
it and i am miserable about it and i will gladly pay for them and you will accept my
apologies yes?
jody simmons looked real hard at jose for a moment and then a smile broke over his
face and he said why sure jose we all make mistakes. you can pay for the pies. he said
jose you are a good conscientious workman and i don't mind if you make a mistake once
in a while. he said jose i wish i had more men like you now forget about the whole thing
and go back to work.
jose stood there kind of quivering all over and shaking his head as if he couldn't
believe such bad luck could happen to him. then he turned and l

as all right only it wasn't big enough. to quit a fine job like this you want to do
something very big. the pie run is all finished for tonight but don't give up hope jose
because we have a pie run every night and tomorrow you can get one of those big racks
of pies. you can get one of those racks that has a hundred and eighty pies just think of it
and you can put that rack in the same place and then you can push the rack over and it
will make a hell of a mess. oh boy oh boy what a mess and then jody simmons will fire
you sure.
jose looked at pinky carson and said the whole thing is very dishonorable but my
constitution will not stand very much more so i will do it tomorrow night when the pie
run comes. then he staggered back to his work.
most of the guys couldn't sleep next day they were so anxious to see jose dump over
that rack. they all came to work early. jody simmons didn't get in until around ten
o'clock usually. but everybody was hoping he would be in early so they would have a
longer time

to look at the face of a man who was going to see one hundred and eighty
pies turned over right in front of his office. but when they passed jody's office and
looked into it jody wasn't there. there was nothing but a big long box that looked like a
floral box lying on jody's desk. they all glanced at the box and then went on upstairs and
changed for work and pretty soon jose came in. the first part of the night was the longest
any of them ever put in.
about ten o'clock jody simmons checked in. everybody watched because everybody
was curious about that box on his desk. jody walked into the office and stared at the box
like it might be a time bomb. he was a very tough man and anything unusual about the
place always aroused his suspicions. finally he must have decided the box was safe
because he began to open it very carefully. two dozen american beauty roses fell out of
it onto his desk. jody began pawing through the roses to find a card but there wasn't any
card. when rudy

 night they had apple and vanilla cream
and blueberry and peach. pinky carson hefted each kind and tested its crust and the
thickness of the filling. the crew was well up on its work that night so they could catch
the pie run while it was still hot. pinky carson decided that the blueberry pies would run
the best if they were dumped. so he very carefully picked a rack of the hottest and
brought them down on the freight elevator to jose.
jose was trembling like a leaf. all the guys stationed near jody simmons' window
looked like they were working but they were really doing nothing but making motions.
very carefully pinky worked the pie rack over to the spot in front of jody simmons'
window. then he ducked to one side and began making signals to jose. jose came up
looking like a whipped dog. he went to the pie rack and put his hand up against the back
of it. it wouldn't take much of a push to knock it over. jose stood there just leaning
against it and looking sad. everybody was waiting for jody simmo

 a crash. one
hundred and eighty hot blueberry pies spread all over the shipping room floor.
for a minute jody just sat in his chair and stared. he looked like he couldn't believe a
thing like this could ever happen to him. then it looked like someone gave him an
electrical shock because instead of pushing his chair back before getting up he shot
straight up like a man on a stove and came running and hollering out of his office. jose
just stood there and looked at him. jose was much taller than jody simmons. he looked
down at jody and his eyes were the saddest things on earth. jody began screaming at him
you lousy spick bastard last night i gave you another chance and tonight what do you do?
you smash one hundred and eighty blueberry pies. you know what this means you
sonofabitch? this means you're through you're fired get out. get out and don't ever let me
see you again you lousy dirty spick get out.
jose stood for a minute and looked at jody simmons like he was forgiving him for
everything he sa

tleman and he
will enjoy them. that he should know where they came from that is quite beside the
point. i know that i have expressed my gratitude with something beautiful. i know that i
have tried to repay him for the splendid things he has done for me. it is not important that
mr. simmons he should know it. it is only important that he should receive the roses yes?
jose put on his coat and walked out of the bakery and nobody ever saw him again.
next day he didn't show up for his check. instead jody simmons received through the
mail a money order from jose for nineteen dollars and eighty-seven cents which with his
pay-check would pay for the pies . . .
it seemed that jose was standing in front of him now weaving back and forth in a
kind of fog. he was talking to jose. he was saying how is everything with you jose how
are you doing? talk right up jose and tell me about how you are doing and how you ever
came out with that rich girl. talk louder jose because i don't seem to be hearing so well
lately
