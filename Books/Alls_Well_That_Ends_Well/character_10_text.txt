    he will return; and hope i may that she,
    hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
    led hither by pure love. which of them both
    is dearest to me i have no skill in sense
    to make distinction. provide this messenger.
    my heart is heavy, and mine age is weak;
    grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.     exeunt




act iii. scene 5.

without the walls of florence
a tucket afar off. enter an old widow of florence, her daughter
diana,
violenta, and mariana, with other citizens

  widow. nay, come; for if they do approach the city we shall
lose
    all the sight.
  diana. they say the french count has done most honourable
service.
  widow. it is reported that he has taken their great'st
commander;
    and that with his own hand he slew the duke's brother.
[tucket]
    we have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary way. hark!
you
    may know by their trumpets.
  mariana. come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with

   report of it. well, diana, take heed of this french earl; the
    honour of a maid is her name, and no legacy is so rich as
    honesty.
  widow. i have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by
a
    gentleman his companion.
  mariana. i know that knave, hang him! one parolles; a filthy
    officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl. beware
of
    them, diana: their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and
all
    these engines of lust, are not the things they go under; many
a
    maid hath been seduced by them; and the misery is, example,
that
    so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood, cannot for all
that
    dissuade succession, but that they are limed with the twigs
that
    threatens them.

    a shrewd turn, if she pleas'd.
  helena. how do you mean?
    may be the amorous count solicits her
    in the unlawful purpose.
  widow. he does, indeed;
    and brokes with all that can in such a suit
    corrupt the tender honour of a maid;
    but she is arm'd for him, and keeps her guard
    in honestest defence.

    that is antonio, the duke's eldest son;
    that, escalus.
  helena. which is the frenchman?
  diana. he-
    that with the plume; 'tis a most gallant fellow.
    i would he lov'd his wife; if he were honester
    he were much goodlier. is't not a handsome gentleman?
  helena. i like him well.
  diana. 'tis pity he is not honest. yond's that same knave
    that leads him to these places; were i his lady
