 enterprise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out
of the common road; that these things were all either too far above me or
too far below me; that mine was the middle state, or what might be called
the upper station of low life, which he had found, by long experience,
was the best state in the world, the most suited to human happiness, not
exposed to the miseries and hardships, the labour and sufferings of the
mechanic part of mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury,
ambition, and envy of the upper part of mankind.  he told me i might
judge of the happiness of this state by this one thing‚Äîviz. that this was
the state of life which all other people envied; that kings have
frequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to great
things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the two
extremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise man gave his
testimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he prayed to have
neither povert

he bade me observe it, and i should always find that the calamities of
life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind, but that the
middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so many
vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind; nay, they were not
subjected to so many distempers and uneasinesses, either of body or mind,
as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and extravagances on the
one hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and mean or
insufficient diet on the other hand, bring distemper upon themselves by
the natural consequences of their way of living; that the middle station
of life was calculated for all kind of virtue and all kind of enjoyments;
that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune; that
temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all agreeable
diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were the blessings

the best of your way to shore, and i will do you no harm; but if you come
near the boat i‚Äôll shoot you through the head, for i am resolved to have
my liberty;‚Äù so he turned himself about, and swam for the shore, and i
make no doubt but he reached it with ease, for he was an excellent
swimmer.

i could have been content to have taken this moor with me, and have
drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust him.  when he was
gone, i turned to the boy, whom they called xury, and said to him, ‚Äúxury,
if you will be faithful to me, i‚Äôll make you a great man; but if you will
not stroke your face to be true to me‚Äù‚Äîthat is, swear by mahomet and his
father‚Äôs beard‚Äî‚Äúi must throw you into the sea too.‚Äù  the boy smiled in my
face, and spoke so innocently that i could not distrust him, and swore to
be faithful to me, and go all over the world with me.

while i was in view of the moor that was swimming, i stood out directly
to sea with the boat, rather stretch

at country, what nation, or what
river.  i neither saw, nor desired to see any people; the principal thing
i wanted was fresh water.  we came into this creek in the evening,
resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and discover the
country; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful noises
of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of we knew not
what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and begged of
me not to go on shore till day.  ‚Äúwell, xury,‚Äù said i, ‚Äúthen i won‚Äôt; but
it may be that we may see men by day, who will be as bad to us as those
lions.‚Äù  ‚Äúthen we give them the shoot gun,‚Äù says xury, laughing, ‚Äúmake
them run wey.‚Äù  such english xury spoke by conversing among us slaves.
however, i was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and i gave him a dram
(out of our patron‚Äôs case of bottles) to cheer him up.  after all, xury‚Äôs
advice was good, and i took it; we dropped our little anchor, and lay
still all night; i say

 still, for we slept none; for in two or three
hours we saw vast great creatures (we knew not what to call them) of many
sorts, come down to the sea-shore and run into the water, wallowing and
washing themselves for the pleasure of cooling themselves; and they made
such hideous howlings and yellings, that i never indeed heard the like.

xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was i too; but we were both
more frighted when we heard one of these mighty creatures come swimming
towards our boat; we could not see him, but we might hear him by his
blowing to be a monstrous huge and furious beast.  xury said it was a
lion, and it might be so for aught i know; but poor xury cried to me to
weigh the anchor and row away; ‚Äúno,‚Äù says i, ‚Äúxury; we can slip our
cable, with the buoy to it, and go off to sea; they cannot follow us
far.‚Ä

nvinced me that there was no going on shore for us in the night on that
coast, and how to venture on shore in the day was another question too;
for to have fallen into the hands of any of the savages had been as bad
as to have fallen into the hands of the lions and tigers; at least we
were equally apprehensive of the danger of it.

be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore somewhere or other
for water, for we had not a pint left in the boat; when and where to get
to it was the point.  xury said, if i would let him go on shore with one
of the jars, he would find if there was any water, and bring some to me.
i asked him why he would go? why i should not go, and he stay in the
boat?  the boy answered with so much affection as made me love him ever
after.  says he, ‚Äúif wild mans come, they eat me, you go wey.‚Äù  ‚Äúwell,
xury,‚Äù said i, ‚Äúwe will both go and if the wild mans come, we will kill
them, they shall eat neither of us.‚Äù  so i gave xury a piece of rusk
bread to eat, a

but the boy seeing a low place about
a mile up the country, rambled to it, and by-and-by i saw him come
running towards me.  i thought he was pursued by some savage, or frighted
with some wild beast, and i ran forward towards him to help him; but when
i came nearer to him i saw something hanging over his shoulders, which
was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but different in colour,
and longer legs; however, we were very glad of it, and it was very good
meat; but the great joy that poor xury came with, was to tell me he had
found good water and seen no wild mans.

but we found afterwards that we need not take such pains for water, for a
little higher up the creek where we were we found the water fresh when
the tide was out, which flowed but a little way up; so we filled our
jars, and feasted on the hare he had killed, and prepared to go on our
way, having seen no footsteps of any human creature in that part of the
country.

as i had been one voyage to this coast before, i knew very
 
 ___________________________
 
 to venture out, in hopes of reaching thither; but having tried
twice, i was forced in again by contrary winds, the sea also going too
high for my little vessel; so, i resolved to pursue my first design, and
keep along the shore.

several times i was obliged to land for fresh water, after we had left
this place; and once in particular, being early in morning, we came to an
anchor under a little point of land, which was pretty high; and the tide
beginning to flow, we lay still to go farther in.  xury, whose eyes were
more about him than it seems mine were, calls softly to me, and tells me
that we had best go farther off the shore; ‚Äúfor,‚Äù says he, ‚Äúlook, yonder
lies a dreadful monster on the side of that hillock, fast asleep.‚Äù  i
looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it was a
terrible, great lion that lay on the side of the shore, under the shade
of a piece of the hill that hung as it were a little over him.  ‚Äúxury,‚Äù
says i, ‚Äúyou shall on shore and kil

l him.‚Äù  xury, looked frighted, and
said, ‚Äúme kill! he eat me at one mouth!‚Äù‚Äîone mouthful he meant.  however,
i said no more to the boy, but bade him lie still, and i took our biggest
gun, which was almost musket-bore, and loaded it with a good charge of
powder, and with two slugs, and laid it down; then i loaded another gun
with two bullets; and the third (for we had three pieces) i loaded with
five smaller bullets.  i took the best aim i could with the first piece
to have shot him in the head, but he
 
 ___________________________
 
 the slugs hit his leg about the knee and broke the
bone.  he started up, growling at first, but finding his leg broken, fell
down again; and then got upon three legs, and gave the most hideous roar
that ever i heard.  i was a little surprised that i had not hit him on
the head; however, i took up the second piece immediately, and though he
began to move off, fired again, and shot him in the head, and had the
pleasure to see him drop and make but little noise, but lie struggling
for life.  then xury took heart, and would have me let him go on shore.
‚Äúwell, go,‚Äù said i: so the boy jumped into the water and taking a little
gun in one hand, swam to shore with the other hand, and coming close to
the creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him in the
head again, which despatched him quite.

this was game indeed to us, but this was no food; and i was very sorry to
lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that was good for
nothing to us.  however, xury said he 
 
 ___________________________
 
would have some of him; so he comes
on board, and asked me to give him the hatchet.  ‚Äúfor what, xury?‚Äù said
i.  ‚Äúme cut off his head,‚Äù said he.  however, xury could not cut off his
head, but he cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was a
monstrous great one.

i bethought myself, however, that, perhaps the skin of him might, one way
or other, be of some value to us; and i resolved to take off his skin if
i could.  so xury and i went to work with him; but xury was much the
better workman at it, for i knew very ill how to do it.  indeed, it took
us both up the whole day, but at last we got off the hide of him, and
spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun effectually dried it in two
days‚Äô time, and it afterwards served me to lie upon.

e east indies, made this
cape, or those islands; and, in a word, i put the whole of my fortune
upon this single point, either that i must meet with some ship or must
perish.

when i had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, as i have said,
i began to see that the land was inhabited; and in two or three places,
as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to look at us; we
could also perceive they were quite black and naked.  i was once inclined
to have gone on shore to them; but xury was my better counsellor, and
said to me, ‚Äúno go, no go.‚Äù  however, i hauled in nearer the shore that i
might talk to them, and i found they ran along the shore by me a good
way.  i observed they had no weapons in their hand, except one, who had a
long slender stick, which xury said was a lance, and that they could
throw them a great way with good aim; so i kept at a distance, but talked
with them by signs as well as i could; and particularly made signs for
something to eat: they beckoned t

frighted, especially the women.  the man that had the lance or dart did
not fly from them, but the rest did; however, as the two creatures ran
directly into the water, they did not offer to fall upon any of the
negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea, and swam about, as if they
had come for their diversion; at last one of them began to come nearer
our boat than at first i expected; but i lay ready for him, for i had
loaded my gun with all possible expedition, and bade xury load both the
others.  as soon as he came fairly within my reach, i fired, and shot him
directly in the head; immediately he sank down into the water, but rose
instantly, and plunged up and down, as if he were struggling for life,
and so indeed he was; he immediately made to the shore; but between the
wound, which was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the water, he
died just before he reached the shore.

it is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures at
the noise and

ve me very freely, and brought me a
great deal more of their provisions, which, though i did not understand,
yet i accepted.  i then made signs to them for some water, and held out
one of my jars to them, turning it bottom upward, to show that it was
empty, and that i wanted to have it filled.  they called immediately to
some of their friends, and there came two women, and brought a great
vessel made of earth, and burnt, as i supposed, in the sun, this they set
down to me, as before, and i sent xury on shore with my jars, and filled
them all three.  the women were as naked as the men.

i was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was, and water; and
leaving my friendly negroes, i made forward for about eleven days more,
without offering to go near the shore, till i saw the land run out a
great length into the sea, at about the distance of four or five leagues
before me; and the sea being very calm, i kept a large offing to make
this point.  at length, doubling the point, at about tw

o leagues from the
land, i saw plainly land on the other side, to seaward; then i concluded,
as it was most certain indeed, that this was the cape de verde, and those
the islands called, from thence, cape de verde islands.  however, they
were at a great distance, and i could not well tell what i had best to
do; for if i should be taken with a fresh of wind, i might neither reach
one or other.

in this dilemma, as i was very pensive, i stepped into the cabin and sat
down, xury having the helm; when, on a sudden, the boy cried out,
‚Äúmaster, master, a ship with a sail!‚Äù and the foolish boy was frighted
out of his wits, thinking it must needs be some of his master‚Äôs ships
sent to pursue us, but i knew we were far enough out of their reach.  i
jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw, not only the ship, but that
it was a portuguese ship; and, as i thought, was bound to the coast of
guinea, for negroes.  but, when i observed the course she steered, i was

od one; and that he saw, and told me he
would buy it of me for his ship‚Äôs use; and asked me what i would have for
it?  i told him he had been so generous to me in everything that i could
not offer to make any price of the boat, but left it entirely to him:
upon which he told me he would give me a note of hand to pay me eighty
pieces of eight for it at brazil; and when it came there, if any one
offered to give more, he would make it up.  he offered me also sixty
pieces of eight more for my boy xury, which i was loth to take; not that
i was unwilling to let the captain have him, but i was very loth to sell
the poor boy‚Äôs liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my
own.  however, when i let him know my reason, he owned it to be just, and
offered me this medium, that he would give the boy an obligation to set
him free in ten years, if he turned christian: upon this, and xury saying
he was willing to go to him, i let the captain have him.

we had a very good voyage to the bra

because his plantation lay next to mine, and we went on
very sociably together.  my stock was but low, as well as his; and we
rather planted for food than anything else, for about two years.
however, we began to increase, and our land began to come into order; so
that the third year we planted some tobacco, and made each of us a large
piece of ground ready for planting canes in the year to come.  but we
both wanted help; and now i found, more than before, i had done wrong in
parting with my boy xury.

but, alas! for me to do wrong that never did right, was no great wonder.
i hail no remedy but to go on: i had got into an employment quite remote
to my genius, and directly contrary to the life i delighted in, and for
which i forsook my father‚Äôs house, and broke through all his good advice.
nay, i was coming into the very middle station, or upper degree of low
life, which my father advised me to before, and which, if i resolved to
go on with, i might as well have stayed at home, and never h

shore.  then, supposing they were not cannibals, yet they might kill me,
as many europeans who had fallen into their hands had been served, even
when they had been ten or twenty together‚Äîmuch more i, that was but one,
and could make little or no defence; all these things, i say, which i
ought to have considered well; and did come into my thoughts afterwards,
yet gave me no apprehensions at first, and my head ran mightily upon the
thought of getting over to the shore.

now i wished for my boy xury, and the long-boat with shoulder-of-mutton
sail, with which i sailed above a thousand miles on the coast of africa;
but this was in vain: then i thought i would go and look at our ship‚Äôs
boat, which, as i have said, was blown up upon the shore a great way, in
the storm, when we were first cast away.  she lay almost where she did at
first, but not quite; and was turned, by the force of the waves and the
winds, almost bottom upward, against a high ridge of beachy, rough sand,
but no water about
