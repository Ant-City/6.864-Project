[CHARACTER] - 
                	one
of miss watson's household slaves. [CHARACTER] is superstitious and occasionally
sentimental, but he is also intelligent, practical, and ultimately
more of an adult than anyone else in the novel. [CHARACTER]'s frequent acts of
selflessness, his longing for his family, and his friendship with
both huck and tom demonstrate to huck that humanity has nothing
to do with race. because [CHARACTER] is a black man and a runaway slave,
he is at the mercy of almost all the other characters in the novel and
is often forced into ridiculous and degrading situations.
