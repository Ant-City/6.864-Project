 the 1920s. let's
now  use  it  as  a  "cosmological  playground"  to  explore  the  properties  of  string  theory  in  a  simple
setting;  we  will  shortly  use  the  insights  we  gain  to  better  understand  all  of  the  spatial  dimensions
string theory requires. toward this end, we imagine that the circular dimension of the garden-hose
universe starts out nice and plump but then shrinks to shorter and shorter size, approaching the form of
lineland—a simplified, partial version of the big crunch.

the  question  we  seek  to  answer  is  whether  the  geometrical  and  physical  properties  of  this
cosmic collapse have features that markedly differ between a universe based on strings and one based
on point particles.

the essential new feature

we do not have to search far to find the essential new string physics. a point particle moving in this
two-dimensional  universe  can  execute  the  kinds  of  motion  illustrated  in  figure  10.2:  it  can  move
along the extended dimension o

s can yield the zero-mass photon, graviton, and the other massless
or near-massless particles, for example. wrapped strings are different in this regard.)

how does the existence of wrapped string configurations affect the geometrical properties of the
dimension  around  which  the  strings  wind?  the  answer,  first  recognized  in  1984  by  the  japanese
physicists keiji kikkawa and masami yamasaki, is bizarre and remarkable.

let's consider the last cataclysmic stages of our variant on the big crunch in the garden-hose
universe. as  the  radius  of  the  circular  dimension  shrinks  to  the  planck  length  and,  in  the  mold  of
general  relativity,  continues  to  shrink  to  yet  smaller  lengths,  string  theory  insists  upon  a  radical
reinterpretation  of  what  actually  happens.  string  theory  claims  that all  physical  processes  in  the
garden-hose universe in which the radius of the circular dimension is shorter than the planck length
and is decreasing are absolutely ident

 comparing apples and oranges. since we now have two
concepts of distance—using light or heavy string probes—we must compare measurements made in
the same manner.

a minimum size

it's been a bit of a trek, but we are now set for the key point. if one does stick to measuring distances
"the easy way"—that is, using the lightest of the string modes instead of the heavy ones—the results
obtained will always be larger than the planck length. to see this, let's think through the hypothetical
big crunch for the three extended dimensions, assuming them to be circular. for argument's sake, let's
say that at the beginning of our thought experiment, unwound string modes are the light ones and by
using them it is determined that the universe has an enormously large radius and that it is shrinking in
time. as it shrinks, these unwound modes get heavier and the winding modes get lighter. when the
radius shrinks all the way to the planck length—that is, when r takes on the value 1—the winding and

 physics we encounter—as discussed in previous sections—will be identical to that of a universe
in which the radius, in the conventional sense of distance, is larger than the planck length (as attested
to, for example, by the exact correspondence between tables 10.1 and 10.2). and it is physics, not
language, that really matters.

brandenberger, vafa, and other physicists have made use of these ideas to suggest a rewriting of
the laws of cosmology in which both the big bang and the possible big crunch do not involve a zero-
size universe, but rather one that is planck-length in all dimensions. this is certainly a very appealing
proposal for avoiding the mathematical, physical, and logical conundrums of a universe that emanates
from  or  collapses  to  an  infinitely  dense  point. although  it  is  conceptually  difficult  to  imagine  the
whole of the universe compressed together into a tiny planck-sized nugget, it is truly beyond the pale
to imagine it crushed to a point of no size at all.
