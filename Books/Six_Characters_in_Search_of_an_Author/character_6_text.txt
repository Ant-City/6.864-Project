the step-daughter, is dashing, almost impudent, beautiful. she wears mourning too, but with great elegance. she shows contempt for the timid half-frightened manner of the wretched boy (14 years old, and also dressed in black); on the other hand, she displays a lively tenderness for her little sister, the child (about four), who is dressed in white, with a black silk sash at the waist.

the son (22) tall, severe in his attitude of contempt for the father, supercilious and indifferent to the mother. he looks as if he had come on the stage against his will.

is dead. two months ago as i said. we are in mourning, as you see.

the father. he isn't here you see, not because he is dead. he isn't here -- look at her a moment and you will understand -- because her drama isn't a drama of the love of two men for whom she was incapable of feeling anything except possibly a little gratitude -- gratitude not for me but for the other. she isn't a woman, she is a mother, and her drama -- powerful sir, i assure you -- lies, as a matter of fact, all in these four children she has had by two men.

the mother. i had them? have you got the courage to say that i wanted them? [to the company.] it was his doing. it was he who gave me that other man, who forced me to go away with him.

the step-daughter. it isn't true.

the mother [startled]. not true, isn't it?

the step-daughter. no, it isn't true, it just isn't true.

the step-daughter. yes, but ask him how his intelligence has helped us.

the father. if we could see all the evil that may spring from good, what should we do? [at this point the leading lady who is biting her lips with rage at seeing the leading man flirting with the step-daughter, comes forward and says to the manager.]

leading lady. excuse me, but are we going to rehearse today?

m to me. and then -- strange but true -- i was driven, by curiosity at first and then by some tender sentiment, towards her family, which had come into being through my will. the thought of her began gradually to fill up the emptiness i felt all around me. i wanted to know if she were happy in living out the simple daily duties of life. i wanted to think of her as fortunate and happy because far away from the complicated torments of my spirit. and so, to have proof of this, i used to watch that child coming out of school.

the step-daughter. yes, yes. true. he used to follow me in the street and smiled at me, waved his hand, like this. i would look at him with interest, wondering who he might be. i told my mother, who guessed at once. [the mother agrees with a nod.] then she didn't want to send me to school for some days; and when i finally went back, there he was again -- looking so ridiculous -- with a paper parcel in his hands. he came close to me, caressed me, and drew out a fine straw

the curtain remains up.

the action of the play is suspended for twenty minutes].

the stage call-bells ring to warn the company that the play it about to begin again.

the step-daughter comes out of the manager's office along with the child and the boy. as she comes out of the office, she cries: --

nonsense! nonsense! do it yourselves! i'm not going to mix myself up in this mess. [turning to the child and coming quickly with her on to the stage.] come on, rosetta, let's run! [the boy follows them slowly, remaining a little behind and seeming perplexed.]

[embraces her, pressing the little head to her breast, and rocking the child for a moment.] oh darling, darling, what a horrid comedy you've got to play! what a wretched part they've found for you! a garden . . . a fountain . . . look . . . just suppose, kiddie, it's here. where, you say? why, right here in the middle. it's all pretence you know. that's the trouble, my pet: it's all make-belive here. it's better to imagine it though, because if they fix it up for you, it'll only be painted cardboard, painted cardboard for the rockery, the water, the plants . . . ah, but

the son [looking at the three entering office]. oh this is fine, fine! and to think i can't even get away! [the mother attempts to look at him, but lowers her eyes immediately when he turns away from her. she then sits down. the boy and the child approach her. she casts a glance again at the son, and speaks with humble tones, trying to draw him into conversation.]

the mother. and isn't my punishment the worst of all? [then seeing from the son's manner that he will not bother himself about her.] my god! why are you so cruel? isn't it enough for one person to support all this torment? must you then insist on others seeing it also?

the step-daughter [anticipating him and with veiled disgust]. no sir . . . i'll do it myself. [takes it off quickly.]

[the mother, who watches the progress of the scene with the son and the other two children who cling to her, is on thorns; and follows with varying expressions of sorrow, indignation, anxiety, and horror the words and actions of the other two. from time to time she hides her face in her hands and sobs.]

the mother. oh, my god, my god!

the father [playing his part with a touch of gallantry]. give it to me! i'll put it down. [takes hat from her hands.] but a dear little head like yours ought to have a smarter hat. come and help me choose one from the stock, won't you?

the step-daughter. how? how can he act all his "noble remorses," all his "moral torments," if you want to spare him the horror of being discovered one day -- after he had asked her what he did ask her -- in the arms of her, that already fallen woman, that child, sir, that child he used to watch come out of school? [she is moved.] [the mother at this point is overcome with emotion, and breaks out into a fit of crying. all are touched. a long pause.]

the step-daughter [as soon as the mother becomes a little quieter, adds resolutely and gravely]. at present, we are unknown to the public. tomorrow, you will act us as you wish, treating us in your own manner. but do you really want to see drama, do you want to see it flash out as it really did?

the mother. i can't bear it. i can't.

the manager. but since it has happened already . . . i don't understand!

the mother. it's taking place now. it happens all the time. my torment isn't a pretended one. i live and feel every minute of my torture. those two children there -- have you heard them speak? they can't speak any more. they cling to me to keep up my torment actual and vivid for me. but for themselves, they do not exist, they aren't any more. and she [indicating the step-daughter.] has run away, she has left me, and is lost. if i now see her here before me, it is only to renew for me the tortures i have suffered for her too.

act iii

when the curtain goes up again, it is seen that the stage hands have shifted the bit of scenery used in the last part, and have rigged up instead at the back of the stage a drop, with some trees, and one or two wings. a portion of a fountain basin is visible. the mother is sitting on the right with the two children by her side. the son is on the same side, but away from the others. he seems bored, angry, and full of shame. the father and the step-daughter are also seated towards the right front. on the other side (left) are the actors, much in the positions they occupied before the curtain was lowered. only the manager is standing up in the middle of the stage, with his hand closed over his mouth in the act of meditating.

the manager [shaking his shoulders after a brief pause]. ah yes: the second act!

the manager.. why not?

the step-daughter. because he [indicates the son again.] is always shut up alone in his room. and then there's all the part of that poor dazed-looking boy there which takes place indoors.

the manager. maybe! on the other hand, you will understand -- we can't change scenes three or four times in one act.

the leading man. they used to once.

the manager. yes, when the public was up to the level of that child there.

the leading lady. it makes the illusion easier.

the father [irritated]. the illusion! for heaven's sake, don't say illusion. please don't use that word, which is particularly painful for us..

the manager [astounded]. and why, if you please?

the father. it's painful, cruel, really cruel; and you ought to understand that.

the manager. but why? what ought we to say then? the illusion, i tell you, sir, which we've got to create for the audience . . .

the leading man. with our acting.

the manager. the illusion of a reality.

the father. i understand; but you, perhaps, do not understand us. forgive me! you see . . . here for you and your actors, the thing is only -- and rightly so . . . a kind of game ...

the leading lady [interrupting indignantly]. a game! we're not children here, if you please! we are serious actors.

the father. i don't deny it. what i mean is the game, or play, of your art, which has to give, as the gentleman says, a perfect illusion of reality.

the manager. precisely -- !

the father. now, if you consider the fact that we [indicates himself and the other five characters.], as we are, have no other reality outside of this illusion . . .

[as if she saw herself still there by the writing table, and was annoyed by the presence of the actors.] oh, if you would only go away, go away and leave us alone -- mother here with that son of hers -- i with that child -- that boy there always alone -- and then i with him [just hints at the father.] -- and then i alone, alone . . . in those shadows!

[to step-daughter.] this is just to give an idea, of course. the boy, instead of hiding behind the doors, will wander about here in the garden, hiding behind the trees.. but it's going to be rather difficult to find a child to do that scene with you where she shows you the flowers.

some actors. he's dead! dead!

other actors. no, no, it's only make believe, it's only
