th headland. the aleuts who had fallen on the
beach, we burned. 
for many days after that the village was quiet. people went out only to gather food and came back to eat in silence. some
wished to leave and go in their canoes to the island called santa cataina, which lies far off to the east, but others said that
there was little water on that island. in the end a council was held and it was decided to stay at ghalas-at.
the council also chose a new chief to take my father's place. his name was kimki. he was very old, but he had been a good
man in his youth and a good hunter. the night he was chosen to be chief, he called everyone together, saying:
'most of those who snared fowl and found fish in the deep water and built canoes are gone. the women, who were never
asked to do more than stay at home, cook food, and make clothing, now must take the place of the men and face the dangers
which abound beyond the village. there will be grumbling in ghalas-at because of this. there will be shirkers

. these will be
punished, for without the help of all, all must perish.'
kimki portioned work for each one in the tribe, giving ulape and me the task of gathering abalones. this shellfish grew on
the rocks along the shore and was plentiful. we gathered them at low tide in baskets and carried them to the mesa where we
cut the dark red flesh from the shell and placed it on flat rocks to dry in the sun.
ramo had the task of keeping the abalones safe from the gulls and especially the wild dogs. dozens of our animals, which
had left the village when their owners had died, join

time other women were gathering the scarlet apples that grow on the cactus bushes and are called tunas. fish
were caught and many birds were netted. so hard did the women work that we really fared better than before when the
hunting was done by the men.
life in the village should have been peaceful, but it was not. the men said that the women had taken the tasks that rightfully
were theirs and now that they had become hunters the men looked down upon them. there was much trouble over this until
kimki decreed that the work would again be divided - henceforth the men would hunt and the women harvest, since there
was already ample food to last through the winter, it no longer mattered who hunted
but this was not the real reason why autumn and winter were unpeaceful in ghalas-at. those who had died at coral cove
were still with us. every- where we went on the island or on the sea, whether we were fishing or eating or sitting by the fires
at night, they were with us. we all remembered some- one

t my father was gone, it was not easy to look after ramo, who was always into some mischief.
it was the same in the other houses of ghalas-at, but more than the burdens which had fallen upon us all, it was the memory
of those who had gone that burdened our hearts.
after food had been stored in autumn and the baskets were full in every house, there was more time to drink about them, so
that a sort of sickness came over the village and people sat and did not speak, nor ever laughed
in the spring, kimki called the tribe together. he had been thinking, he said, during the winter and had decided that he would
take a canoe and go to the east to a country which was there and which he had once been to when he was a boy. it lay many
days across the sea, but he would go there and make a place for us. he would go alone, because he could not spare more of
our men for the voyage, and he would return.
the day that kimki left was fair. we all went to the cove and watched him launch the big canoe. it held

two baskets of water
and enough tunas and dried abalone to last many days.
we watched while kimki paddled through the narrow opening in the rocks. slowly he went through the kelp beds and into
the sea. there he waved to us and we waved back. the rising sun made a silver trail across the water. along this trail he
disappeared into the east.
the rest of the day we talked about the journey. would kimki ever reach this far country about which nothing was known?
would he come back before the winter was over? or never?
that night we sat around the fire and talked while the wind blew and the waves crashed against the shore.

after kimki had been gone one moon, we began to watch for his return. every day someone went to the cliff to scan the sea.
even on stormy days we went, and on days when fog shrouded the island. during the day there was always a watcher on the 
cliff and each night as we sat

around out fires we wondered if the next sun would bring him home.
but the spring came and left and the sea was empty. kimki did not return!
there were few storms that winter and rain was light and ended early. this meant that we would need to be careful of water.
in the old days the springs sometimes ran low and no one worried, but now everything seemed to cause alarm. many were
afraid that we would die of thirst.
'there are other things more important to ponder,' said matasaip who had taken kimki's place.
matasaip meant the aleuts, for it was now the time of year when they had come before. watchers on the cliff began to look
for the red sails and a meeting was held to plan what to do if the aleuts came. we lacked the men to keep them from landing
or to save our lives if they attacked us, which we were certain they would. plans were therefore made to flee as soon as their
ship was sighted.
food and water were stored in canoes and these were hidden on the rocks at the south end of the isl

have been running for more than a league,' he said. ‘i cannot talk.'
'you are talking,' someone said.
'speak, nanko, speak,' cried many voices.
nanko was having fun with us. he threw out his chest and took a deep breath. he looked around at the circle of faces as if he 
did not understand why everyone was staring at him.
'the ship,' he said at last, saying the words slowly, ‘does not belong to our enemies, the aleuts. there are white men on this
ship and they have come from that place where kimki went when he left our island.'
'has kimki returned?' an old man broke in.
'no, but it is he who saw the white men and told them to come here.'
'what do they look like !' ulape asked.
'are there boys on the ship?' asked ramo, who had come back with his mouth full of something.
everyone seemed to be talking at once.
nanko made his face stern, which was hard for him to do because his mouth had been cut in the battle with the aleuts and
ever since it had always seemed to smile. he held up his hand

for silence. 'the ship has come for one reason,' he said. 'to
take us away from ghalas-at.'
'to what place?’ i asked.
it was good news that the ship did not belong to the aleuts. but where would the white men take us !
'i do not know to what place,' he said. 'kimki knows and he has asked the white men to take us there.'
saying no more, nanko turned back and we followed him. we were fearful of where we were going, yet we were happy, too.

we took nothing with us when we thought we would have to see, so there was much excitement as we packed our baskets.
nanko strode up and down outside the houses, urging us to hurry.
'the wind grows strong,' he shouted. ‘the ship will leave you.'
i filled two baskets with the things i wished to take. three fine needles

ded, i went to the place where the canoes had been hidden, and let myself down over
the cliff. this part of the shore was sheltered from the wind and i found the canoes just as they had been left. the dried food
was still good, but the water was stale, so i went back to the spring and filled a fresh basket.
i had decided during the days of the storm, when i had given up hope of seeing the ship, that i would take one of the canoes
and go to the country that lay towards the east. i remembered how kimki, before he had gone, had asked the advice of his
ancestors who had lived many ages in the past, who had come to the island from that country, and likewise the advice of
zuma, the medicine man who held power over the wind and the seas. but these things i could not do, for zuma had been
killed by the aleuts, and in all my life i had never been able to speak with the dead, though many times i had tried.
yet i cannot say that i was really afraid as i stood there on the shore. i knew that my ancesto

rs had crossed the sea in their 
canoes, coming from that place which lay beyond. kimki, too, had crossed the sea. i was not nearly so skilled with a canoe as
these men, but i must say that whatever might befall me on the endless waters did not trouble me. it meant far less than the
thought of staying on the island alone, without a home or companions, pursued by wild dogs, where everything reminded me
of those who were dead and those who had gone away.
of the four canoes stored there against the cliff, i chose the smallest, which was still very heavy because it could carry six

nes together with two small sticks and sinew. for a while he did not try to walk. then, because he was not old
enough to fly, he began to hobble around the yard.
with the young birds and the old ones, the white gull and rontu, who was always trotting at my heels, the yard seemed a
happy place. if only i had not remembered tutok. if only i had not wondered about my sister ulape, where she was, and if 
the marks she had drawn upon her cheeks had proved magical. if they had, she was now married to kimki and was the
mother of many children. she would have smiled to see all of mine, which were so different from the ones i always wished to
have.
early that spring i started to gather abalones and i gathered many, taking them to the headland to dry. i wanted to have a good
supply ready if the aleuts came again.
one day when i was on the reef filling my canoe, i saw a herd of otter in the kelp near by. they were chasing each other,
putting their heads through the kelp and then going under and coming
