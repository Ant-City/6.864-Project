held up his hand, calling himself captain orlov. my father also held up his hand. i could not see his
face, but i doubted that he smiled in return.
'i have come with forty of my men,' said the russian. ‘we come to hunt sea otter. we wish to camp on your island while we
are hunting.'
my father said nothing. he was a tall man, though not so tall as captain orlov, and he stood with his bare shoulders thrown
back, thinking about what the russian had said. he was in no hurry to reply be- cause the aleuts had come before to hunt
otter. that was long in the past, but my father still remembered them.
'you remember another hunt,' captain orlov said when my father was silent. 'i have heard of it, too. it was led by captain
mitriff who was a fool and is now dead. the trouble arose because you and your tribe did all of the hunting.'
'we hunted,' said my father, ‘but the one you call a fool wished us to hunt from one moon to the next, never ceasing.' 'this
time you will need to do nothing,' captain o

captain orlov and his aleut hunters moved to the island that morning, making many trips from their ship to the beach of
coral cove. since the beach was small and almost flooded when the tide was in, he asked if he could camp on higher ground.
this my father agreed to.
perhaps i should tell you about our island so you will know how it looks and where our village was and where the aleuts
camped for most of the summer.
our island is two leagues long and one league wide, and if you were standing on one of the hills that rise in the middle of it,
you would think that it looked like a fish. like a dolphin lying on its side, with its tail pointing towards the sunrise, its nose
pointing to the sunset, and its fins making reefs and the rocky ledges along the shore. whether someone did stand there on the
low hills in the days when the earth was new and, because of its shape, called it

wind. it blows almost every day, sometimes from the north-
west and sometimes from the east, once in a long while out of the south. all the winds except the one from the south are
strong, and because of them the hills are polished smooth and the trees are small and twisted, even in the canyon that runs
down to coral cove.
the village of ghalas-at lay east of the hills on a small mesa, near coral cove and a good spring. about a half league to the
north is another spring and it was there that the aleuts put up their tents which were made of skins and were so low to the
earth that the men had to crawl into them on their stomachs. at dusk we could see the glow of their fires.
that night my father warned everyone in the village of ghalas-at against visiting the camp. 'the aleuts come from a country
far to the north,' he said. ‘their ways are not ours nor is their language. they have come to take otter and to give us our share
in many goods which they have and which we can use. in this way shall

tent he sits on a rock and combs until the beard shines like a cormorant's wing,'
ramo said.
my sister ulape, who was two years older than i, gathered the most curious news of all. she swore that there was an aleut
girl among the hunters.
'she is dressed in skins just like the men,' ulape said. ‘but she wears a fur cap and under the cap she has thick hair that falls
to her waist.'
no one believed ulape. everyone laughed at the idea that hunters would bother to bring their wives with them.
the aleuts also watched our village, otherwise they would not have known about the good fortune which befell us soon after
they came. 
it happened in this way. early spring is a poor season for fishing. the heavy seas and winds of winter drive the fish into deep
water where they stay until the weather is settled and where they are hard to catch. during this time the village eats sparingly,
mostly from stores of seeds harvested in autumn.
word of our good fortune came on a stormy afternoon, brought by ulap

f and looked down. the school of white bass was still on the ledge, glistening in the sun. but since the
tide was high and the biggest waves were already lapping at the fish, there was no time to lose. one by one we hauled them
out of reach of the tide. then, two women carrying a single fish, for they were all of about the same size and heavy, we lifted
them up the cliff and brought them home.
there were enough for everyone in our tribe for supper that night and the next, but in the morning two aleuts came to the
village and asked to speak to my father. 
'you have fish,' one of them said.
'enough only for my people,' my father answered.
'you have fourteen fish,' the aleut said.
'seven now because we ate seven.'
'from seven you am spare two.'
'there are forty in your camp,' my father replied, 'and more than that of us. besides, you have your own fish, the dried ones
that you brought.'
'we tire of that kind,' the aleut said. he was a short man who only came to my father's shoulders, and he had

r short legs across the sand dunes that lay between
the village and their camp.
we ate the rest of the white bass that night and there was much rejoicing. but little did we know, as we ate and sang and the
older men told stories around the fire, that our good fortune would soon bring trouble to ghalas-at.

the wide beds of kelp which surround our island on three sides come close to the shore and spread out to sea for a distance of 
a league. in these deep beds, even on days of heavy winds, the aleuts hunted. they left the shore at dawn in their skin canoes
and did not return until night, towing after them the slain otter.
the sea otter, when it is swimming, looks like a seal, but is really very different. it has a shorter nose than a seal, small
webbed feet instead of flippers, and fur that is thicker and much more beautiful. it is also different in other ways. the otter
likes to lie on its back in the kelp beds, floating up and down to the motion of the waves, sunning itself or sleeping th

ey are
the most playful animals in the sea.
it was these creatures that the aleuts hunted for their pelts.
from the cliff i could see the skin canoes darting here and there over the kelp beds, barely skimming the water, and the long
spears flying like arrows. at dark the hunters brought their catch into coral cove, and there on the beach the animals were
skinned and fleshed. two men, who also sharpened the spears, did this work, labouring far into the night by the light of
seaweed fires. in the morning the beach would be strewn with carcasses, and the waves red with blood.

counted the dead otter and
thought of the beads and other things that each pelt meant. but i never went to the cove and whenever i saw the hunters with
their long spears skimming over the water, i was angry, for these animals were my friends. it was fun to see them playing or
sunning themselves among the kelp. it was more fun than the thought of beads to wear around my neck.
this i told my father one morning.
'there are scarcely a dozen left in the beds around coral cove,' i said. ‘before the aleuts came there were many.
'many still live in other places around the island,' he replied, laughing at my foolishness. ‘when the hunters leave they will
come back.'
'there will be none left,' i said. ‘the hunters will kill them all. this morning they hunt on the south. next week they move to
another place.'
'the ship is filled with pelts. in another week the aleuts will be ready to go.'
i was sure that my father thought they would leave soon, for two days before he had sent some of our young me

n to the beach
to build a canoe from a log which had drifted in from the sea. 
there are no trees on the island except the small ones stunted by the wind. when a log came ashore, as happened once in a
long time, it was always carried to the village and worked on where a chance wave could not wash it away. that the men
were sent to hollow out the log in the cove, and to sleep beside it during the night, meant that they were there to watch the
aleuts, to give the alarm should captain orlov try to sail off without paying us for the otter skins.
everyone was afraid he might, so besides the men in the cove who watched the aleut ship, others kept watch on the camp.
every hour someone brought news. ulape said that the aleut woman spent a whole afternoon cleaning her skin aprons, which
she had not done before while she had been there. early one morning, ramo said he had just seen captain orlov carefully
trimming his beard so that it looked the wa

y it did when he first came. the aleuts who sharpened the long spears stopped this
work and gave all their time to skinning the otter which were brought in at dusk.
we in the village of ghalas-at knew that captain orlov and his hunters were getting ready to leave the island. would he pay
us for the otter he had slain or would he try to sneak away in the night ! \would our men have to fight for our rightful share !
these questions everyone asked while the aleuts went about their preparations - everyone except my father, who said
nothing, but each night worked on the new spear he was making.

the aleuts left on a sunless day. out of the north deep waves rolled down upon the island. they broke against the rocks and
roared into the caves, sending up white sprays of water. before night a storm would certainly strike.
not long after dawn the aleuts took down their skin tents and carried them to the beach.
captain orlov had not paid my father for the otter

ied towards coral cove. the men with their weapons went first and the women
followed. the men took the trail that led to the beach, but the women hid themselves among the brush on the cliff.
ulape and i went together far out on the ledge where i had hidden before when the hunters first came. 
the tide was low and the rocks and the narrow beach were scattered with bundles of otter pelts. half of the hunters were on
the ship. the rest were wading into the water, tossing the pelts into a boat. the aleuts laughed while they worked, as if they
were happy to leave the island.
my father was talking to captain orlov. i could not hear their words because of the noise the hunters made, but from the way
my father shook his head, i knew that he was not pleased.
'he is angry,' ulape whispered.
'not yet,' i said. ‘when he's really angry, he pulls his ear.
the men who were working on the canoe had stopped and were watching my father and captain orlov. the other men of our
tribe stood at the foot of the t

ised his hand and gave a signal. when
the boat came back it held a black chest which two of the hunters carried to the beach.
captain orlov raised the lid and pulled out several necklaces. there was little light in the sky, yet the beads sparkled as he
named them this way and that. beside me, ulape drew in her breath in excitement, and i could hear cries of delight from the
women hidden in the brush.
but the cries suddenly ceased as my father shook his head and turned his back on the chest. the aleuts stood silent. our men
left their places at the foot of the trail and moved forward a few steps and waited, watching my father.
'one string of beads for one otter pelt is not our bargain,' my father said.
'one string and one iron spearhead,' said captain orlov, lifting two fingers.
'the chest does not hold that much,' my father answered.
'there are more chests on the ship,' said the russian.
'then bring them to the shore,' my father said. 'you have one hundred and five bales of otter on the ship
 
 ___________________________
 
. there are fifteen
here in the cove. you will need three more chests of this size.' 
captain orlov said something to his aleuts that i could not understand, but its meaning was soon clear. there were many
hunters in the cove and as soon as he spoke they began to carry the otter pelts to the boat.
beside me ulape was scarcely breathing. ‘do you think that he will give us the other chests!' she whispered.
‘i do not trust him.'
'when he gets the pelts to the ship he may leave.'
'it is possible.'
the hunters had to pass my father to reach the boat, and when the first one approached him, he stepped in his path.
'the rest

the russian drew himself up stiffly and pointed to the clouds that were blowing in towards the island.
'i load the ship before the storm arrives,' he said.
'give us the other chests. then i will help you with our canoes,' my father replied.
captain orlov was silent. his gaze moved slowly around the cove. he looked at our men standing on the ledge of rock a
dozen paces away. he looked upward towards the cliff and back at my father. then he spoke to his aleuts.
i do not know what happened first, whether it was my father who raised his hand against the hunter whose path he barred,
whether it was this man who stepped forward with a bale of pelts on his back and shoved my father aside. it all happened so
quickly that i could not tell one act from the other. but as i jumped to my feet and ulape screamed and other cries sounded
along the cliff, i saw a figure lying on the rocks. it was my father and blood was on his face. slowly he got to his feet.

from the deck of the ship. a
loud noise echoed against the cliff. five of our warriors fell and lay quiet.
ulape screamed again and hung a rock into the cove. it fell harmlessly beside captain orlov. rocks showered into the cove
from many places along the cliff, striking several of the hunters. then our warriors rushed in upon them and it was hard to tell 
one from the other.
ulape and i: stood on the cliff, and watched helplessly, afraid to use the rocks we held lest we injure our own men.
the aleuts had dropped the bales of otter. they drew knives from their belts and as our warriors rushed upon them the two
lines surged back and forth along the beach. men fell to the sand and rose to fight again. others fell and did not get up. my
father was one of these.
for a long time it seemed that we would win the battle. but captain orlov, who had rowed off to the ship when the battle
started, returned with more of his aleuts.
our warriors were forced backward to the cliffs. there were few of them l

eft, yet they fought at the foot of the trail and
would not retreat.
the wind began to blow. suddenly captain orlov and his aleuts turned and ran to the boat. our men did not pursue them.
the hunters reached the ship, the red sails went up, and that ship moved slowly between the two rocks that guard the cove.
once more before it disappeared a white puff of smoke rose from the deck. as ulape and i ran along the cliffs a whirring
sound like a great bird in flight passed above our heads.

that night was the most terrible time in all the memory of ghalas-at. when the fateful day had dawned the tribe numbered
forty-two men, co

unting those who were too old to fight. when night came and the women had carried back to the village
those who had died on the beach of coral cove, there remained only fifteen. of these, seven were old men.
there was no woman who had not lost a father or a husband, a brother or a son.
the storm lasted two days and the third day we buried our dead on the south headland. the aleuts who had fallen on the
beach, we burned. 
for many days after that the village was quiet. people went out only to gather food and came back to eat in silence. some
wished to leave and go in their canoes to the island called santa cataina, which lies far off to the east, but others said that
there was little water on that island. in the end a council was held and it was decided to stay at ghalas-at.
the council also chose a new chief to take my father's place. his name was kimki. he was very old,
 
 ___________________________
 
the next sun would bring him home.
but the spring came and left and the sea was empty. kimki did not return!
there were few storms that winter and rain was light and ended early. this meant that we would need to be careful of water.
in the old days the springs sometimes ran low and no one worried, but now everything seemed to cause alarm. many were
afraid that we would die of thirst.
'there are other things more important to ponder,' said matasaip who had taken kimki's place.
matasaip meant the aleuts, for it was now the time of year when they had come before. watchers on the cliff began to look
for the red sails and a meeting was held to plan what to do if the aleuts came. we lacked the men to keep them from landing
or to save our lives if they attacked us, which we were certain they would. plans were therefore made to flee as soon as their
ship was sighted.
food and water were stored in canoes and these were hidden on the rocks at the south end of the island. the cliffs were steep

ip was sighted we would all go to the cliff and let ourselves down, one at a time. we would
then leave in our canoes for the island of santa catalina.
although the entrance to coral cove was too narrow for a ship to pass through safely at night, men were sent there to watch
the cove from dusk to dawn, besides those who watched during the day.
shortly afterwards, on a night of fine moon, one of the men came running back to the village. everyone was asleep, but his
cries quickly awakened us.
'the aleuts !' he shouted. 'the aleuts!'
it was news we expected. we were prepared for it, yet there was much fear in the village of ghalas-at. matasaip strode from
hut to hut telling everyone to be calm and not to lose time packing things that would not be needed. i took my skirt of yucca
fibre, however, for i had spent many days making it and it was very pretty, and also my otter cape.
quietly we filed out of the village along the trail that led towards the place where our canoes were hidden. the moon wa

growing pale and there was a faint light in the east, but a strong wind began to blow. 
we had gone no farther than half a league when we were overtaken by the man who had given the warning. he spoke to
matasaip, but we all gathered around to listen to him.
'i went back to the cove after i gave the alarm, he said. ‘when i got there i could see the ship clearly. it is beyond the rocks
that guard the harbour. it is a smaller ship than the one which belonged to the aleuts. the sails are white instead of red.'
'could you see anyone?' matasaip asked.
‘no.’
'it is not the same ship which was here last spring ?'
'no.’
matasaip was silent, pondering the news. then he told us to go on to where the canoes were and wait for him, for he was
going back. it was light now and we went quickly over the dunes to the edge of the cliff and stood there while the sun rose.
the wind grew cold, but fearing that those on the ship would see the smoke we did not start a fire, tho

and we knew that he brought good news.
'speak!' everyone said in a chorus.
'i have been running for more than a league,' he said. ‘i cannot talk.'
'you are talking,' someone said.
'speak, nanko, speak,' cried many voices.
nanko was having fun with us. he threw out his chest and took a deep breath. he looked around at the circle of faces as if he 
did not understand why everyone was staring at him.
'the ship,' he said at last, saying the words slowly, ‘does not belong to our enemies, the aleuts. there are white men on this
ship and they have come from that place where kimki went when he left our island.'
'has kimki returned?' an old man broke in.
'no, but it is he who saw the white men and told them to come here.'
'what do they look like !' ulape asked.
'are there boys on the ship?' asked ramo, who had come back with his mouth full of something.
everyone seemed to be talking at once.
nanko made his face stern, which was hard for him to do because his mouth had been cut in the battle w

ever since it had always seemed to smile. he held up his hand for silence. 'the ship has come for one reason,' he said. 'to
take us away from ghalas-at.'
'to what place?’ i asked.
it was good news that the ship did not belong to the aleuts. but where would the white men take us !
'i do not know to what place,' he said. 'kimki knows and he has asked the white men to take us there.'
saying no more, nanko turned back and we followed him. we were fearful of where we were going, yet we were happy, too.

we took nothing with us when we thought we would have to see, so there was much excitement as we packed our baskets.
nanko strode up and down outside the houses, urging us to hurry.
'the wind grows strong,' he shouted. ‘the ship wil

o small. it was good for spearing fish and little else.
the laws of ghalas-at forbade the making of weapons by women of the tribe, so i went out to search for any that might have
been left behind. i went first to where the village had been and sifted the ashes for spearheads, and then, finding none, to the
place where the canoes were hidden, believing that weapons might have been stored there with the food and water.
i found nothing in the canoes under the cliff. then, remembering the chest the aleuts had brought to shore, i set out far coral
cove. i had seen that chest on the beach during the battle but did not remember that the hunters had taken it with them when
they fled.
the beach was empty except for rows of seaweed washed in by the storm. the tide was out and i looked in the place where
the chest had lain.
it was just below the ledge ulape and i had stood on while we watched the battle. the sand was smooth and i dug many small
holes with a stick. i dug in a wide circle, thinking that

ed the whole length of the cove. the beads and the bracelets made tinkling sounds. i felt like the bride of a chief as i
walked there by the waves.
i came to the foot of the trail where the battle had been fought. suddenly i remembered those who had died there and the men
who had brought the jewels i was wearing. i went back to the chest. for a long time i stood beside it, looking at the bracelets
and the beads hanging from my neck, so beautiful and bright in the sun. 'they do not belong to the aleuts,' i said, 'they
belong to me.' but even as i said this i knew that i never could wear them.
one by one i took them off. i also took the rest of the beads from the chest. then i walked through the waves and flung them
all far away, out into the deep water.
there were no iron spearheads in the chest. i closed the lid and covered it with sand.
i looked along the bottom of the trail, but finding nothing there that i could use, gave up my search.
for many days i did not think of the weapons again, n

ed down to the tide pools where they
stood first on one leg and then the other, splashing water over themselves and combing their feathers with curved beaks. then
they flew off down the shore to look for food. beyond the kelp beds pelicans were already hunting, soaring high over the
clear water, diving straight down, if they sighted a fish, to strike the sea with a great splash that i could hear.
i also watched the otter hunting in the kelp. these shy little animals had come back soon after the aleuts had left and now
there seemed to be as many of them as before. the early morning sun shone like gold on their glossy pelts.
yet as i lay there on the high rock, looking at the stars, i thought about the ship which belonged to the white men. and at
dawn, as light spread across the sea, my first glance was towards the little harbour of coral cove. every morning i would
look for the ship there, thinking that it might have come in the night. and each morning i would see nothing except the birds

t.
i had decided during the days of the storm, when i had given up hope of seeing the ship, that i would take one of the canoes
and go to the country that lay towards the east. i remembered how kimki, before he had gone, had asked the advice of his
ancestors who had lived many ages in the past, who had come to the island from that country, and likewise the advice of
zuma, the medicine man who held power over the wind and the seas. but these things i could not do, for zuma had been
killed by the aleuts, and in all my life i had never been able to speak with the dead, though many times i had tried.
yet i cannot say that i was really afraid as i stood there on the shore. i knew that my ancestors had crossed the sea in their 
canoes, coming from that place which lay beyond. kimki, too, had crossed the sea. i was not nearly so skilled with a canoe as
these men, but i must say that whatever might befall me on the endless waters did not trouble me. it meant far less than the
thought of staying on t

s clean, but i
found what i had come for.
some of the teeth were as long as my hand and half its width. they were curved at the tops and some were broken, but when
i had ground the best of them down with sand, i had for my work four good spear points, broad at the bottom and very sharp
at the ends.
i made two more spears from these points and at last was ready to go to the cave of the wild dogs. 
15
there had been wild dogs on the island of the blue dolphins as long as i remember, but after the aleuts had slain most of the
men of our tribe and their dogs had left to join the others, the pack became much bolder. it spent the nights running through
the village and during the day was never far off. it was then that we made plans to get rid of them, but the ship came and
everyone left ghalas-at.
i am sure that the pack grew bolder because of their leader, the big one with the thick fur around his neck and the yellow
eyes.
i had never seen this dog before the aleuts came and no one else had, so h

first at the fish i carried and then at me and moved his tail. that night i stayed in the house. before i fell asleep i thought of a
name for him, for i could not call him dog. the name i thought of was rontu, which means in our language fox eyes.
16
the white men's ship did not return that spring or in the summer. but every day, whether i was on the headland or gathering
shellfish on the rocks or working on my canoe, i watched for it. i also watched for the red ship of the aleuts.
i was not sure what i would do if the aleuts came. i could hide in the cave which i had stored with food and water, for it was
surrounded by thick brush and the mouth of the ravine could only be reached from the sea. the aleuts had not used the spring 
and did not know about it because there was another one closer to where they had camped. but they might come upon the
cave by chance and then i must be ready to flee.
for this reason i worked on the canoe i had abandoned on the spit. i went to t

 to be on the sea after the winter storms, with the new spear in my hand, but all the morning as i hunted the giant
devilfish i kept thinking of rontu. i should have been happy, yet thinking of him i was not. would he come back, i
wondered, or had he gone to live with the wild dogs? would he again be my enemy ? if he were my enemy, i knew that i
could never kill him, now that he had been my friend.
when the sun was high i hid the canoe in the cave we had found, for once more it was the time the aleuts might return, and
with the two small bass i had speared, though not the giant devil fish, i went up the cliff. i had planned to make a trail from
the cave to my house, but had decided that it could be seen from a ship and by anyone standing on the head- land.
the climb was steep. as i reached the top, i paused for breath. the morning was quiet except for the noise of the little birds
flying from bush to bush and the cries of the gulls who did not like these strangers. then i heard the sound of

wings began to feather out, i cut them again. this time i let them loose in the yard, where they hopped around
hunting food, perching on rontu who by now had got used to them. the next time they feathered out, i did not trim their
wings, but they never flew farther away than the ravine and would always come back at night to sleep and, no matter how
much they had eaten, to ask for food. 
one, because he was larger, i called tainor. i named him after a young man i liked who had been killed by the aleuts. the
other was called lurai, which was a name i wished i had been called instead of karana.
during the time that i was taming the birds, i made another skirt. this one i also made of yucca fibres softened in water and
braided into twine. i made it just like the others, with folds running lengthwise. it was open on both sides and hung to my
knees. the belt i made of sealskin which could be tied in a knot. i also made a pair of sandals from sealskin for walking over
the dunes when the sun was hot

, or just to be dressed up when i wore my new skirt of yucca twine.
often i would put on the skirt and the sandals and walk along the cliff with rontu. sometimes i made a wreath of flowers and
fastened it in my hair. after the aleuts had killed our men at coral cove, all the women of our tribe had singed their hair
short as a sign of mourning. i had singed mine, too, with a faggot, but now it had grown long again and came to my waist. i
parted it and let it fall down my back, except when i wore a wreath. then i made braids and fastened them with long whalebone
pins.
i also made a wreath for rontu's neck, which he did not like. together we would walk along the cliff looking at the sea, and

 planned to go out the next morning.
two summers had come and gone and the aleut hunters had not returned, yet during these days i always looked for them. at
dawn, as rontu and i went down the cliff, i would watch the ocean for their sails. the summer air was clear and i: could see
many leagues. wherever we went in the canoe i would never be gone longer than half a day. on the way home, i always 
paddled close to shore and looked for them.
it was the last time that we went to tall rock that the aleuts came.
i had hidden the canoe and climbed the cliff with the ten cormorant skins slung over my back. at the top of the cliff i stood
for a while gazing at the sea. there were some small clouds on the water. one of them, the smallest, did not look like the
others, and as i watched, i saw that it was a ship.
the sun made bright scales on the water, but i could see clearly. there were two sails and it was a ship coming towards the
island. for a long time i could not tell the colour of the sails. i

wondered if it could be the white men, though now i thought
about them little and seldom looked for them.
i left the cormorants hanging on the fence and went to the rock on the headland. i could see no better from the rock because
the sun was low and the whole ocean was covered with light. then as i stood there i remembered that the white men's ship
would come from the east. this one had come from a different direction - from the north.
i still was not sure that it belonged to the aleuts, but i decided to pack the things that i would take to the cave in the ravine.
there was much to take - my two birds, the skirt i had made, the stone utensils, my beads and ear-rings, the cormorant

when i had packed everything and put it beside the hole under the fence, i went back to the head- land. i lay on the rock so 1
would not be seen and peered over its rim towards the north. for a m

oment i did not find the ship, and then i saw that it had
travelled faster than i thought it would. it was already rounding the kelp bed, close to the rocks of coral cove. the last of the
sun shone on the ship, on the bow, which was made like the beak of a bird, and on the two red sails.
i knew that the aleuts would not come on shore in the dark, and that i had until morning to carry my things to the cave, but i
did not wait. most of the night i worked, making two trips to the cave. at dawn, when everything had been moved, i went
back to the house for the last time. there i buried. the ashes of my fires and threw sand over the shelves and the door. i took
down the shells i had put up to scare the gulls and tossed them and the abalones over the cliff. at last, with a pelican wing, i

shore and some were out in the kelp beds, beginning to hunt for otter. there was a fire on the shore and beside it, a girl. she 
was cooking something and i could see the fire shining on her hair.
i did not stay long on the headland. always in the past i had gone to the ravine by a different way so as not to wear a trail.
this time i went off towards the west, along the cliff, and then doubled back through the brush, being careful to leave no
tracks. rontu's prints did not matter because the aleuts knew that there were dogs on the island.
the cave was very dark and i had trouble getting rontu to go through the small opening. only after i had crawled in and out
several times would he follow me. i closed the opening with stones, and since i was tired, lay down and slept all that day. i
slept until i could see the stars shining between the cracks in the rocks.

i did not take rontu with me when i left the cave that night. and i closed the opening so that he would not follow me, for if

aleuts had brought their dogs, he would surely smell them out. i went quietly through the brush to the headland.
before i had climbed to the top of the high rock i could see the glow of the aleut fires. they had camped on the mesa, at the
place and the spring they had used before. it was less than half a league from my cave.
i stood for a long time watching the fires, wondering if i should move to another part of the island, perhaps to the cave where
the wild dogs had lived. i was not afraid that the

ave barked. i waited until the tide was low, which was close to dawn, and filled a basket with sea water
and abalones. we were back in the cave before it grew light.
the sea water kept the abalones fresh, but when we had to go out again the night was too dark to find our way to the reef. i
therefore had to gather roots. i could never gather many before the sun rose, so i went out every morning until the next moon
came. then i went to the reef for abalones.
during all this time i saw none of the aleuts. nor did the girl come near the cave, though i found her footsteps far down the
ravine where she had been to dig roots. the aleuts had not brought their dogs, which was fortunate, for they would have
found rontu's tracks and followed us to the cave.
the days were long for rontu and me. at first he would pace up and down the cave and stand at the opening sniffing through
the cracks. i did not let him out except when i was with him for fear he would go to the camp and not come back. after a

as simple to make. i wanted this one to be better, so i cut the skins carefully and sewed them with great care.
i made the bottom first, putting the skins end to end, and using three of them. for the rest of the skirt i sewed the others along
their sides so that the feathers ran one way on the upper part and a different way along the bottom.
it was a beautiful skirt and i finished it on the day after the second moon. i had burned all of the little fish, and since i could
catch no more until the aleuts left, i took the skirt outside to work on it there. i had found footsteps in the ravine twice again
after the first time, but no closer to the cave. i had begun to feel safe, for the winter storms would soon be here and the aleuts
would leave. before another moon they would be gone.
i had never seen the skirt in the sunlight. it was black, but underneath were green and gold colours, and all the feathers
shimmered as though they were on fire. it was more beautiful than i had thought it would be.

nt back to sleep.
i was standing in the sunlight, holding the skirt to my waist, when rontu leaped to his feet. i heard the sound of steps. it came
from the direction of the spring and as i turned quickly i saw a girl looking down at me from the brush.
my spear stood beside the mouth of the cave within easy reach. the girl was not more than ten paces from me and with one
movement i could have picked up the spear and thrown it. why i did not throw the spear, i do not know, for she was one of
the aleuts who had killed my people on the beach of coral cove.
she said something and rontu left the mouth of the cave and walked slowly towards her. the hair raised on his neck, but then
he walked to where she stood and let her touch him.
the girl looked at me and made a motion with her hands which i took to mean that rontu was hers.
'no,' i cried and shook my head.
i picked up my spear.
she started to nun and i thought that she was going to flee back through the brush. she made another motion which i t

i was so proud of the skirt that i did not think. the spear was in my hand, but i held up the skirt so the sunlight could shine on
all of it.
the girl jumped down from the ledge and came over to me and touched it.
‘wintscha,' she said again.
i did not say the word, but she wanted to hold the skirt and i gave it to her. she put it against her waist and let it fall from her
hips, turning one way and the other. she was graceful and the skirt flowed around her like water, but i hated the aleuts and
took it from her.

i had not heard words spoken for so long that they sounded strange to me, yet they were good to hear, even though it was an
enemy who spoke them.
she said other words i did not understand, but now as she spoke she looked over my shoulder towards the cave. she pointed
to the cave and then to me and made gestures as if she were making a fire. i knew what she wanted me to say, but i did not
say it. she wished to know if i lived there in the cave so she co

 she said more words and smiled again and
walked to the spring and drank. the next moment she had disappeared in the brush. rontu did not try to follow her. she made
no noise as she went.
i crawled back in the cave and began to pack the things i owned. i had all the day to do it, because the men were working and
would not return to their camp before night.
by nightfall i was ready to go. i planned to take my canoe and go to the west part of the island. i could sleep there on the
rocks until the aleuts left, moving from place to place if i needed to. 
i carried five baskets up the ravine and hid them near my house. it was getting dark and i had to go back to the cave for two
that were left. carefully i crawled through the brush and stopped just above the mouth of the cave and listened. rontu was
beside me and he listened also. no one could go through the brush in the dusk without making a sound, except someone who
had lived in it for a long time.
i went past the spring and waited and then on

ters would leave. perhaps
they had already gone. that afternoon i went to the headland. i climbed the rock and crawled across it until i could look over
the rim. my heart beat loud.
the aleut ship was still there, but men were working on the deck and canoes were going back and forth. the wind blew hard
and few bales of otter skins lay on the shore so probably the ship would leave at dawn.
it was dark when i got back to the ravine. since the wind was very cold and i was no longer afraid that the aleuts would find
me, i made a fire in the cave and cooked a supper of shellfish and roots. i cooked enough for rontu and me and for tutok. i
knew tutok would not come, yet i put her food beside the fire and waited.
once rontu barked and i thought i heard the sound of footsteps and went to the opening and listened. i waited a long while
and did not eat. clouds moved from the north, covering the cold sky. the wind grew louder and made wild noises in the
ravine. at last i closed the mouth of the cave wi

xt day that i could not fish on the reef even at low tide, and since i had nothing to give him i
did not go to the pool.
it was three days before i could catch fish and when i went there again the pool was deserted. i knew that he would leave
someday, but i felt bad that he had gone back to the sea and that i would never catch fish for him again. nor would i know
him if i saw him again in the kelp, for now that he had grown and his wound had healed, he looked like all the others.
soon after the aleuts had left i moved back to the headland.
nothing had been harmed except the fence, which i mended, and in a few days the house was the same as before. the only
thing that worried me was that all the abalones i had gathered in the summer were gone. i would need to live from day to day
on what i could catch, trying to get enough on the days when i could fish to last through the times when i could not. through
the first part of the winter, before mon-a- nee swam away, this was sometimes hard to do.

afterwards it was not so hard and
rontu and i always had enough to eat.
while the aleuts were on the island, i had no chance to catch little smelts and dry them, so the nights that winter were dark
and i went to bed early and worked only during the day. but still i made another string for my fishing spear, many hooks of 
abalone shell, and last of all ear-rings to match the necklace tutok had given me.
these took a long time, for i searched the beach many mornings when the tide was out before i found two pebbles of the
same colour as the stones in the necklace and soft enough to cu

f only i had not remembered tutok. if only i had not wondered about my sister ulape, where she was, and if 
the marks she had drawn upon her cheeks had proved magical. if they had, she was now married to kimki and was the
mother of many children. she would have smiled to see all of mine, which were so different from the ones i always wished to
have.
early that spring i started to gather abalones and i gathered many, taking them to the headland to dry. i wanted to have a good
supply ready if the aleuts came again.
one day when i was on the reef filling my canoe, i saw a herd of otter in the kelp near by. they were chasing each other,
putting their heads through the kelp and then going under and coming up again in a different place. it was like a game we
used to play in the brush when there were children on the island. i looked for mon-a-nee, but each of them was like the other.
i filled my canoe with abalone and paddled towards shore, one of the otter following me. as i stopped he dived and c

ulape would have laughed at me, and others would have laughed, too - my father most of all. yet this is the way i felt about
the animals who had become my friends and those who were not, but in time could be. if ulape and my father had come back
and laughed, and all the others had come back and laughed, still i would have felt the same way, for animals and birds are
like people, too, though they do not talk the same or do the same things. without them the earth would be an unhappy place.

the aleuts never again came to the island of the blue dolphins, but every summer i watched for them, and early every spring
i gathered shellfish, which i dried and stored in the cave where i kept my canoe.
two winters after they left i made more weapons - a spear, a bow, and a quiver of arrows. these i also stored in the place 
beneath the headland, so if the hunters returned i would be ready to go to another part of the island, to move from cave to
cave, living in my canoe if necessary.
for many summers

after the aleuts had gone the herd of otter left coral cove. the old otter which had survived the aleut
spears and by now were aware that summer was a time of danger would lead the herd away. they went far off to the kelp
beds of tall rock where they stayed until the first storms of winter.
often rontu and i would go out to the rock and live there for several days catching fish for won-a- me and the others i had
come to know.
one summer the otter did not leave, the summer that rontu died, and i knew then that n

ves had reached.
i found the remains of my other canoe. it had been washed far back in the cave and i could not get it out, so i went back to the
south cliffs and hunted among the piles of kelp until i had enough pieces of wood, counting what i already had, to begin the
building of another.
it was late in the spring now. the weather was still unsettled, with light rain falling most of the days, but i started the new
canoe anyway, for i needed it to gather shellfish. no longer did i think of the aleuts, as i have said, yet without a canoe to go
where i wanted, i felt uneasy.
the planks were all about the same size, the length of my arm, but they came from different canoes and were therefore hard
to fit together. the holes were ready, however, which saved me much labour and time. another help was that the great waves
had washed ashore long strings of black pitch, which was often difficult to find on the island and which i needed. 
when i had sorted out the planks and shaped them, the work went

ometimes came at this season, stood banks
of grey clouds, one on top of the other.
at this moment, in the deep shadows cast by the clouds, i saw something else. forgetting that i was carrying a load of
seaweed, i threw up my arms. the seaweed fell to the ground.
a sail, a ship, was there on the sea, half-way between the horizon and the shore!
by the time i had reached the headland it was much closer, moving quickly on the strong wind. i could see that it did not have
the red, beaked prow of the aleuts. nor did it look like the white men's ship, which i clearly remembered.
why had it come to the island of the blue dolphins?
i crouched on the headland and wondered, my heart beating fast, if the men who sailed it had come to catch otter. if they were
hunters, i must hide be- fore they saw me. they would soon find my fire and the canoe i was making, yet i could go to the
cave and probably be safe from them. but if they had been sent by my people to take me away, then i should not hide.
the ship

moved slowly between the black rocks and into coral cove. i could see the men now and they were not aleuts.
they lowered a canoe and two of the men paddled towards the beach. the wind had begun to blow hard and the men had
trouble landing. finally one of them stayed behind in the canoe, and the other, the man without a beard, jumped into the water
and came along the beach and up the trail.
i could not see him, but after a while i heard a shout, then another, and i knew that he had found my fire and the canoe. the
man he had left in the cove did not answer, nor did the men on the ship, so i was sure

t and my otter cape, which were much more beautiful than the thing he was
making.
the dress reached from my throat to my feet and i did not like it, either the colour of it or the way it scratched. it was also
hot. but i smiled and put my cormorant skirt away in one of the baskets to wear when i got across the sea, sometime when the
men were not around.
the ship stayed in coral cove nine days. it had come for otter, but the otter had gone. some must have been left, after all,
who remembered the aleuts, for on that morning there were none to be seen.
i knew where they had gone. they had gone to tall rock, but when the men showed me the weapons they had brought to kill
the otter, i shook my head and acted as though i did not understand.
they pointed to my otter cape, but i still shook my head.
i asked them then about the ship that had taken my people away many years before, making the signs of the ship and pointing
to the east, but they did not understand. not until i came to mission santa bar
