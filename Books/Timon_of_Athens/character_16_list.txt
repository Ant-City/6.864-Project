Painter  - 
      
        One of Timon's hangers-on, the Painter paints Timon's likeness for pay when Timon is wealthy. The Painter goes to the wilderness to seek Timon after his fall, having heard Timon found gold and hoping to get into his good graces. Timon thinks he's a money-grubbing flatterer.
