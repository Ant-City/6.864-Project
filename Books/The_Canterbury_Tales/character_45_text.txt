of the gospel of john.

21. mulier est hominis confusio:  this line is taken from the
same fabulous conference between the emperor adrian and the
philosopher secundus, whence chaucer derived some of the
arguments in praise of poverty employed in the wife of bath's
tale proper. see note 14 to the wife of bath's tale.  the
passage transferred to the text is the commencement of a
description of woman. "quid est mulier? hominis confusio," &c.
("what is woman? a union with man", &c.)

22. col-fox: a blackish fox, so called because of its likeness to
coal, according to skinner; though more probably the prefix has
a reproachful meaning, and is in some way connected with the
word "cold" as, some forty lines below, it is applied to the
prejudicial counsel of women, and as frequently it is used to
describe "sighs" and other tokens of grief, and "cares" or
"anxieties."

23. undern:  in this case, the meaning of "evening" or
"afternoon" can hardly be applied to the word, which must be
taken to

 habitation; he therefore orders the servants to
call him at first cock-crowing, which the cock overhearing did
not crow at all that morning. so gundulfus overslept himself,
and was thereby disappointed of his ordination, the office being
quite finished before he came to the place." wireker's satire was
among the most celebrated and popular latin poems of the
middle ages. the ass was probably as tyrwhitt suggests,
called "burnel" or "brunel," from his brown colour; as, a little
below, a reddish fox is called "russel."

30. flattour: flatterer; french, "flatteur."

31. losengeour: deceiver, cozener; the word had analogues in
the french "losengier," and the spanish "lisongero." it is
probably connected with "leasing," falsehood; which has been
derived from anglo-saxon "hlisan," to celebrate -- as if it meant
the spreading of a false renown

32. dan russel: master russet; a name given to the fox, from
his reddish colour.
