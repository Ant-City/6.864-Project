[CHARACTER](chief [CHARACTER]) - 
      karana's six-year-old brother is a very enthusiastic boy. he is confident and proud of himself and his heritage, and often rash (as young boys are wont to be). it is such rashness that causes him to be left behind when his tribe leaves ghalas-at, and such confidence that is the cause of his trouble with the wild dogs.
