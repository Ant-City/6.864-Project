h he might make a creditable appearance at
her marriage. mr. pontellier had selected the bridal gift, as every
one immediately connected with him always deferred to his taste in such
matters. and his suggestions on the question of dress--which too
often assumes the nature of a problem--were of inestimable value to his
father-in-law. but for the past few days the old gentleman had been upon
edna’s hands, and in his society she was becoming acquainted with a new
set of sensations. he had been a colonel in the confederate army, and
still maintained, with the title, the military bearing which had always
accompanied it. his hair and mustache were white and silky, emphasizing
the rugged bronze of his face. he was tall and thin, and wore his coats
padded, which gave a fictitious breadth and depth to his shoulders
and chest. edna and her father looked very distinguished together, and
excited a good deal of notice during their perambulations. upon his
arrival she began by introducing him to her atel

there in their mother’s bright atelier. when they drew near he motioned
them away with an expressive action of the foot, loath to disturb the
fixed lines of his countenance, his arms, or his rigid shoulders.

edna, anxious to entertain him, invited mademoiselle reisz to meet
him, having promised him a treat in her piano playing; but mademoiselle
declined the invitation. so together they attended a soiree musicale
at the ratignolles’. monsieur and madame ratignolle made much of the
colonel, installing him as the guest of honor and engaging him at
once to dine with them the following sunday, or any day which he might
select. madame coquetted with him in the most captivating and naive
manner, with eyes, gestures, and a profusion of compliments, till the
colonel’s old head felt thirty years younger on his padded shoulders.
edna marveled, not comprehending. she herself was almost devoid of
coquetry.

there were one or two men whom she observed at the soiree musicale;

e her. she discovered that he interested her, though
she realized that he might not interest her long; and for the first time
in her life she felt as if she were thoroughly acquainted with him. he
kept her busy serving him and ministering to his wants. it amused her
to do so. she would not permit a servant or one of the children to do
anything for him which she might do herself. her husband noticed, and
thought it was the expression of a deep filial attachment which he had
never suspected.

the colonel drank numerous “toddies” during the course of the day, which
left him, however, imperturbed. he was an expert at concocting strong
drinks. he had even invented some, to which he had given fantastic
names, and for whose manufacture he required diverse ingredients that it
devolved upon edna to procure for him.

when doctor mandelet dined with the pontelliers on thursday he could
discern in mrs. pontellier no trace of that morbid condition which her
husband had reported to him. she was excited

her had been to the race course, and their thoughts when
they seated themselves at table were still occupied with the events of
the afternoon, and their talk was still of the track. the doctor had not
kept pace with turf affairs. he had certain recollections of racing
in what he called “the good old times” when the lecompte stables
flourished, and he drew upon this fund of memories so that he might not
be left out and seem wholly devoid of the modern spirit. but he failed
to impose upon the colonel, and was even far from impressing him with
this trumped-up knowledge of bygone days. edna had staked her father
on his last venture, with the most gratifying results to both of them.
besides, they had met some very charming people, according to the
colonel’s impressions. mrs. mortimer merriman and mrs. james highcamp,
who were there with alcee arobin, had joined them and had enlivened the
hours in a fashion that warmed him to think of.

mr. pontellier himself had no particular leaning toward

the dinner was excellent. the claret was warm and the champagne was
cold, and under their beneficent influence the threatened unpleasantness
melted and vanished with the fumes of the wine.

mr. pontellier warmed up and grew reminiscent. he told some amusing
plantation experiences, recollections of old iberville and his youth,
when he hunted ‘possum in company with some friendly darky; thrashed
the pecan trees, shot the grosbec, and roamed the woods and fields in
mischievous idleness.

the colonel, with little sense of humor and of the fitness of things,
related a somber episode of those dark and bitter days, in which he had
acted a conspicuous part and always formed a central figure. nor was
the doctor happier in his selection, when he told the old, ever new
and curious story of the waning of a woman’s love, seeking strange, new
channels, only to return to its legitimate source after days of fierce
unrest. it was one of the many little human documents which had been

thrust upon him.

“i hope it isn’t arobin,” he muttered to himself as he walked. “i hope
to heaven it isn’t alcee arobin.”

edna and her father had a warm, and almost violent dispute upon the
subject of her refusal to attend her sister’s wedding. mr. pontellier
declined to interfere, to interpose either his influence or his
authority. he was following doctor mandelet’s advice, and letting her do
as she liked. the colonel reproached his daughter for her lack of
filial kindness and respect, her want of sisterly affection and womanly
consideration. his arguments were labored and unconvincing. he doubted
if janet would accept any excuse--forgetting that edna had offered
none. he doubted if janet would ever speak to her again, and he was sure
margaret would not.

edna was glad to be rid of her father when he finally took himself
off with his wedding garments and his bridal gifts, with his padded
shoulders, his bible

 reading, his “toddies” and ponderous oaths.

mr. pontellier followed him closely. he meant to stop at the wedding
on his way to new york and endeavor by every means which money and love
could devise to atone somewhat for edna’s incomprehensible action.

“you are too lenient, too lenient by far, leonce,” asserted the colonel.
“authority, coercion are what is needed. put your foot down good and
hard; the only way to manage a wife. take my word for it.”

the colonel was perhaps unaware that he had coerced his own wife into
her grave. mr. pontellier had a vague suspicion of it which he thought
it needless to mention at that late day.

edna was not so consciously gratified at her husband’s leaving home as
she had been over the departure of her father. as the day approached
when he was to leave her for a comparatively long stay, she grew melting
and affectionate, remembering his many acts of consideration and his
repeated expressions of an ardent attachment

before each guest stood a tiny glass that looked and sparkled like a
garnet gem.

“then, all things considered,” spoke arobin, “it might not be amiss
to start out by drinking the colonel’s health in the cocktail which he
composed, on the birthday of the most charming of women--the daughter
whom he invented.”

mr. merriman’s laugh at this sally was such a genuine outburst and so
contagious that it started the dinner with an agreeable swing that never
slackened.

miss mayblunt begged to be allowed to keep her cocktail untouched before
her, just to look at. the color was marvelous! she could compare it to
nothing she had ever seen, and the garnet lights which it emitted were

unspeakably rare. she pronounced the colonel an artist, and stuck to it.

monsieur ratignolle was prepared to take things seriously; the mets, the
entre-mets, the service, the decorations, even the people. he looked
up from his pompano and inquired of arobin if he were related to the
gentleman of that name who formed one of the firm of laitner and arobin,
lawyers. the young man admitted that laitner was a warm personal friend,
who permitted arobin’s name to decorate the firm’s letterheads and to
