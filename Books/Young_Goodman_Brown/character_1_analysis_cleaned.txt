[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER] represents the stability of the home and the domestic sphere in the puritan worldview. [CHARACTER], as her name suggests, appears to be the most pure-hearted person in the story and serves as a stand-in of sorts for all religious feeling. goodman brown clings to her when he questions the goodness of the people around him, assuring himself that if [CHARACTER] remains godly, then his own [CHARACTER] is worth fighting temptation to maintain. when he sees that [CHARACTER] has been corrupted, he believes in the absolute evil at the heart of man. his estrangement from [CHARACTER] at the end of the story is the worst consequence of his change of heart. if he is able to be suspicious of [CHARACTER], hawthorne suggests, then he has truly become estranged from the goodness of god.
