'i see a ring,' said bernard, 'hanging above me. it quivers and hangs in a loop of light.'

'i see a slab of pale yellow,' said susan, 'spreading away until it meets a purple stripe.'

'i hear a sound,' said rhoda, 'cheep, chirp; cheep chirp; going up and down.'

'i see a globe,' said neville, 'hanging down in a drop against the enormous flanks of some hill.'

'i see a crimson tassel,' said jinny, 'twisted with gold threads.'

'i hear something stamping,' said louis. 'a great beast's foot is chained. it stamps, and stamps, and stamps.'

'look at the spider's web on the corner of the balcony,' said bernard. 'it has beads of water on it, drops of white light.'

'the leaves are gathered round the window like pointed ears,' said susan.

'a shadow falls on the path,' said louis, 'like an

'the birds' eyes are bright in the tunnels between the leaves,' said neville.

'the stalks are covered with harsh, short hairs,' said jinny, 'and drops of water have stuck to them.'

'a caterpillar is curled in a green ring,' said susan, 'notched with blunt feet.'

'the grey-shelled snail draws across the path and flattens the blades behind him,' said rhoda.

'and burning lights from the window-panes flash in and out on the grasses,' said louis.

'bubbles form on the floor of the saucepan,' said jinny. 'then they rise, quicker and quicker, in a silver chain to the top.'

'now billy scrapes the fish-scales with a jagged knife on to a wooden board,' said neville.

'the dining-room window is dark blue now,' said bernard, 'and the air ripples above the chimneys.'

'a swallow is perched on the lightning-conductor,' said susan. 'and biddy has smacked down the bucket on the kitchen flags.'

'that is the first stroke of the church bell,' said louis. 'then the others follow; one, two; one, two; one, two.'

"is he dead?" i thought, and kissed you, with my heart jumping under my pink frock like the leaves, which go on moving, though there is nothing to move them. now i smell geraniums; i smell earth mould. i dance. i ripple. i am thrown over you like a net of light. i

'she has passed the tool-house door with her handkerchief screwed into a ball. she was not crying, but her eyes, which are so beautiful, were narrow as cats' eyes before they spring. i shall follow her, neville. i shall go gently behind her, to be at hand, with my curiosity, to comfort her when she bursts out in a rage and thinks, "i am alone."

'bernard's stories amuse me,' said neville, 'at the start. but when they tail off absurdly and he gapes, twiddling a bit of string, i feel my own solitude. he sees everyone with blurred edges. hence i cannot talk to him of percival. i cannot expose my absurd and violent passion to his sympathetic understanding. it too would make a "story". i need someone whose mind falls like a chopper on a block; to whom the pitch of absurdity is sublime, and a shoe-string adorable. to whom i can expose the urgency of my own passion? louis is too cold,

'in a world which contains the present moment,' said neville, 'why discriminate? nothing should be named lest by so doing we change it. let it exist, this bank, this beauty, and i, for one instant, steeped in pleasure. the sun is hot. i see the river. i see trees specked and burnt in the autumn sunlight. boats float past, through the red, through the green. far away a bell tolls, but not for death. there are bells that ring for life. a leaf falls, from joy. oh, i am in love with life! look how the willow shoots its fine sprays into the air! look how thro

'how strange,' said bernard, 'the willow looks seen together. i was byron, and the tree was byron's tree, lachrymose, down-showering, lamenting. now that we look at the tree together, it has a combined look, each branch distinct, and i will tell you what i feel, under the compulsion of your clarity.

'when there are buildings like these,' said neville, 'i cannot endure that there should be shop-girls. their titter, their gossip, offends me; breaks into my stillness, and nudges me, in moments of purest exultation, to remember our degradation.

'but now we have regained our territory after that brief brush with the bicycles and the lime scent and the vanishing figures in the distracted street. here we are masters of tranquillity and order; inheritors of proud tradition. the lights are beginning to make yellow slits across the square. mists fro

'now they have returned, my inmates, my familiars. now the stab, the rent in my defences that neville made with his astonishing fine rapier, is repaired. i am almost whole now; and see how jubilant i am, bringing into play all that neville ignores in me. i feel, as i look from the window, parting the curtains, "that would give him no pleasure; but it rejoices me."

'i think of louis now. what malevolent yet searching light would louis throw upon this dwindling autumn evening, upon this china-smashing and trolling of hunting-songs, upon neville, byron and our life here? his thin lips are somewhat pursed; his cheeks are pale; he pores in an office over some obscure commercial docume

'it is now five minutes to eight,' said neville. 'i have come early. i have taken my place at the table ten minutes before the time in order to taste every moment of anticipation; to see the door open and to say, "is it percival? no; it is not percival." there is a morbid pleasure in saying: "no, it is not percival." i have seen the door open and shut twenty times already; each time the suspense sharpens. this is the place to which he is coming. this is the table at which he will sit. here, incredible as it seems, will be his actual body. th

'the door opens, the door goes on opening,' said neville, 'yet he does not come.'

'there is jinny,' said susan. 'she stands in the door. everything seems stayed. the waiter stops. the diners at the table by the door look. she seems to centre everything; round her tables, lines of doors, windows, ceilings, ray themselves, like rays round the star in the middle of a smashed window-pane. she brings things to a point, to order. now she sees us, and moves, and all the rays ripple and flow and waver over us, bringing in new tides of sensation. we change.

'now,' said neville, 'my tree flowers. my heart rises. all oppression is relieved. all impediment is removed. the reign of chaos is over. he has imposed order. knives cut again.'

'now let us issue from the darkness of solitude,' said louis.

'now let us say, brutally and directly, what is in our minds,' said neville. 'our isolation, our preparation, is over. the furtive days of secrecy and hiding, the revelations on staircases, moments of terror and ecstasy.'

'down from our heads veils fell,' said rhoda. 'we clasped the flowers with their green leaves rustling in garlands.'

'we changed, we became unrecognizable,' said louis. 'exposed to all these different lights, what we had in us (for we are all so different) came intermittently, in violent patches, spaced by blank voids, to the surface as if some acid had dropped unequally on the plate. i was this, neville that, rhoda different again, and bernard too.'

'then canoes slipped through palely tinted yellow branches,' said neville, 'and bernard, advancing in his casual way against breadths of green, against houses of very ancient foundation, tumbled in a heap on the ground beside me. in an access of emotion--winds are not more raving, nor lightning more sudden--i took my poem, i flung my poem, i slammed the door behind me.'

'after the capricious fires, the abysmal dullness of youth,' said neville, 'the light falls upon real objects now. here are knives and forks. the world is displayed, and we too, so that we can talk.'

'we differ, it may be too profoundly,' said louis, 'for explanation. but let us attempt it. i smoothed my hair when i came in, hoping to look like the rest of you. but i cannot, for i am not single and entire as you are. i have lived a thousand lives already. every day i unbury--i dig up. i find relics of myself in the sand that women made thousands of years ago, when i

'but when you stand in the door,' said neville, 'you inflict stillness, demanding admiration, and that is a great impediment to the freedom of intercourse. you stand in the door making us notice you. but none of you saw me approach. i came early; i came quickly and directly, here, to sit by the person whom i love. my life has a rapidity that yours lack. i am like a hound on the scent. i hunt from dawn to dusk. nothing, not the pursuit of perfection through the sand, nor fame, nor money, has meaning for me. i shall have riches; i shall have

'the roar of london,' said louis, 'is round us. motor-cars, vans, omnibuses pass and repass continuously. all are merged in one turning wheel of single sound. all separate sounds--wheels, bells, the cries of drunkards, of merrymakers--are churned into one sound, steel blue, circular. then a siren hoots. at that shores slip away, chimneys flatten themselves, the ship makes for the open sea.'

'percival is going,' said neville. 'we sit here, surrounded, lit up, many coloured; all things--hands, curtains, knives and forks, other people dining--run into each other. we are walled in here. but india lies outside.'

'i see india,' said bernard. 'i see the low, long shore; i see the tortuous lanes of stamped mud that lead in and out among ramshackle pagodas; i see the gilt and crenellated buildings which have an air of fragility and decay as if they were temporarily run up buildings in some oriental exhibition. i see a pai

'it is love,' said jinny, 'it is hate, such as susan feels for me because i kissed louis once in the garden; because equipped as i am, i make her think when i come in, "my hands are red," and hide them. but our hatred is almost indistinguishable from our love.'

'yet these roaring waters,' said neville, 'upon which we build our crazy platforms are more stable than the wild, the weak and inconsequent cries that we utter when, trying to speak, we rise; when we reason and jerk out these false sayings, "i am this; i am that!" speech is false.

'yes, between your shoulders, over your heads, to a landscape,' said rhoda, 'to a hollow where the many-backed steep hills come down like birds' wings folded. there, on the short, firm turf, are bushes, dark leaved, and against their darkness i see a shape, white, but not of stone, moving, perhaps alive. but it is not you, it is not you, it is not you; not percival, susan, jinny, neville or louis. when the white arm rests upon the knee it is a triangle; now it is upright--a column; now a fountain, falling. it makes no sign, it does not beckon, it does not see us. behind it roars the sea. it is beyond our reach. yet there i venture. there i go to replenish my emptiness, to stretch my nights and fill them fuller and fuller with dreams. and for a second even now, even here, i reach my object and say, "wander no more. all else is trial and make-believe. here is the end." but these

'but his slippers?' said neville. 'and his voice downstairs in the hall? and catching sight of him when he does not see one? one waits and he does not come. it gets later and later. he has forgotten. he is with someone else. he is faithless, his love meant nothing. oh, then the agony--then the intolerable despair! and then the door opens. he is here.'

'he has red ears,' said louis, 'and the smell of meat hangs down in a damp net while the city clerks take snacks at the lunch bar.'

'with infinite time before us,' said neville, 'we ask what shall we do? shall we loiter down bond street, looking here and there, and buying perhaps a fountain-pen because it is green, or asking how much is the ring with the blue stone? or shall we sit indoors and watch the coals turn crimson? shall we stretch our hands for books and read here a passage and there a passage? shall we shout with laughter for no reason? shall we push through flowering meadows and make daisy chains? shall we find out when the next train starts for the hebride

'let us hold it for one moment,' said jinny; 'love, hatred, by whatever name we call it, this globe whose walls are made of percival, of youth and beauty, and something so deep sunk within us that we shall perhaps never make this moment out of one man again.'

'forests and far countries on the other side of the world,' said rhoda, 'are in it; seas and jungles; the howlings of jackals and moonlight falling upon some high peak where the eagle soars.'

'happiness is in it,' said neville, 'and the quiet of ordinary things. a table, a chair, a book with a paper-knife stuck between the pages. and the petal falling from the rose, and the light flickering as we sit silent, or, perhaps, bethinking us of some trifle, suddenly speak.'

'week-days are in it,' said susan, 'monday, tuesday, wednesday; the horses going up to the fields, and the horses returning; the rooks rising and falling, and catching the elm-trees in their net, whether it is april, whether it is november.'

'peaked clouds,' said rhoda, 'voyage over a sky dark like polished whalebone.'

'now the agony begins; now the horror has seized me with its fangs,' said neville. 'now the cab comes; now percival goes. what can we do to keep him? how bridge the distance between us? how fan the fire so that it blazes for ever? how signal to all time to come that we, who stand in the street, in the lamplight, loved percival? now percival is gone.'

"more than he loved susan?" susan, engaged to her farmer in the country, will stand for a second with the telegram before her, holding a plate; and then, with a kick of her heel, slam to the oven door. neville, after staring at the window through his tears, will see through his tears, and ask, "who passes the window?"--"what lovely boy?" this is my tribute to percival; withered violets, blackened violets.

'where shall i go then? to some museum, where they keep rings under glass cases, where there are cabinets, and the dresses that queens have worn? or shall i go to hampton court and look at the red walls and courtyards and the seemliness of herded yew trees making black pyramids symmetrically on the

'and velvet flowers and leaves whose coolness has been stood in water wash me round, and sheathe me, embalming me.'

'why, look,' said neville, 'at the clock ticking on the mantelpiece? time passes, yes. and we grow old. but to sit with you, alone with you, here in london, in this firelit room, you there, i here, is all. the world ransacked to its uttermost ends, and all its heights stripped and gathered of their flowers, holds no more. look at the firelight running up and down the gold thread in the curtain. the fruit it circles droops heavy. it falls on the toe of your boot, it gives your face a red rim--i think it is the firelight

'i will drive to my own house. i will fill the vases with lavish, with luxurious, with extravagant flowers nodding in great bunches. i will place one chair there, another here. i will put ready cigarettes, glasses and some gaily covered new unread book in case bernard comes, or neville or louis. but perhaps it will not be bernard, neville or louis, but somebody new, somebody unknown, somebody i passed on a staircase and, just turning as we passed, i murmured, "come." he will come this afternoon; somebody i do not know, somebody new. let the silent army of the dead descend. i march forward.'

'i no longer need a room now,' said neville, 'or walls and firelight. i am no longer young. i pass jinny's house without envy, and smile at the young man who arranges his tie a little ner

ampton court--the words beat a gong in the space which i have so laboriously cleared with half a dozen telephone messages and post cards, give off ring after ring of sound, booming, sonorous: and pictures rise--summer afternoons, boats, old ladies holding their skirts up, one urn in winter, some daffodils in march--these all float to the top of the waters that now lie deep on every scene.

there at the door by the inn, our meeting-place, they are already standing--susan, louis, rhoda, jinny and neville. they have come together already. in a moment, when i have joined them, another arrangement will form, another pattern. what now runs to waste, forming scenes profusely, will be checked, stated. i am reluctant to suffer that compulsion. already at fifty yards distance i feel the order of my being changed. the tug of the magnet of their society tells upon me. i come nearer. they do not see me. now rhoda sees me, but she pretends, with her horror of the shock of meeting, that i am a stranger. now

'now sitting side by side,' said neville, 'at this narrow table, now before the first emotion is worn smooth, what do we feel? honestly now, openly and directly as befits old friends meeting with difficulty, what do we feel on meeting? sorrow. the door will not open; he will not come. and we are laden. being now all of us middle-aged, loads are on us. let us put down our loads. what have you made of life, we ask, and i? you, bernard; you, susan; you, jinny; and rhoda and louis? the lists have been posted on the doors. before we break

before, when we met in a restaurant in london with percival, all simmered and shook; we could have been anything. we have chosen now, or sometimes it seems the choice was made for us--a pair of tongs pinched us between the shoulders. i chose. i took the print of life not outwardly, but inwardly upon the raw, the white, the unprotected fibre. i am clouded and bruised with the print of minds and faces and things so subtle that they have smell, colour, texture, substance, but no name. i am merely "neville" to you, who see the narrow limits of my life and the line it cannot pass. but to myself i am immeasurable; a net whose fibres pass imperceptibly beneath the world. my net is almost indistinguishable from that which it surrounds. it lifts whales--huge leviathans and white jellies, what is amorphous and wandering; i detect, i perceive. beneath my eyes opens--a book; i see to the bottom; the heart--i see to the depths. i know what loves are trembling into fire; how jealousy shoots its green flash

'there was the beech wood,' said susan, 'elvedon, and the gilt hands of the clock sparkling among the trees. the pigeons broke the leaves. the changing travelling lights wandered over me. they escaped me. yet look, neville, whom i discredit in order to be myself, at my hand on the table. look at the gradations of healthy colour here on the knuckles, here on the palm. my body has been used daily, rightly, like a tool by a good workman, all over. the blade is clean, sharp, worn in the centre.

'a phrase. an imperfect phrase. and what are phrases? they have left me very little to lay on the table, beside susan's hand; to take from my pocket, with neville's credentials. i am not an authority on law, or medicine, or finance. i am wrapped round with phrases, like damp straw; i glow, phosphorescent. and each of you feels when i speak, "i am lit up. i am glowing." the little boys used to feel "that's a good one, that's a good one", as the phrases bubbled up from my lips under the elm trees in the playing-fields. they too bubbled up; they also escaped with my phrases. but i pine in solitude. solitude is my undoing.

'oppose ourselves to this illimitable chaos,' said neville, 'this formless imbecility. making love to a nursemaid behind a tree, that soldier is more admirable than all the stars. yet sometimes one trembling star comes in the clear sky and makes me think the world beautiful and we maggots deforming even the trees with our lust.'

'unreasonably, ridiculously,' said neville, 'as we walk, time comes back. a dog does it, prancing. the machine works. age makes hoary that gateway. three hundred years now seem no more than a moment vanished against that dog. king william mounts his horse wearing a wig, and the court ladies sweep the turf with their embroidered panniers. i am beginning to be conv

'while we advance down this avenue,' said louis, 'i leaning slightly upon jinny, bernard arm-in-arm with neville, and susan with her hand in mine, it is difficult not to weep, calling ourselves little children, praying that god may keep us safe while we sleep. it is sweet to sing together, clasping hands, afraid of the dark, while miss curry plays the harmonium.'

'we have destroyed something by our presence,' said bernard, 'a world perhaps.'

'the willow tree grew by the river. i sat on the smooth turf with neville, with larpent, with baker, romsey, hughes, percival and jinny. through its fine plumes specked with little pricked ears of green in spring, of orange in autumn, i saw boats; buildings; i saw hurrying, decrepit women. i buried match after match in the turf decidedly to mark this or that stage in the process of understanding (it might be philosophy; science; it might be myself) while the fringe of my intelligence floating unattached caught those distant sensations which after a time the mind draw

'it was for this reason that instead of pulling on my patent-leather shoes and finding a tolerable tie, i sought neville. i sought my oldest friend, who had known me when i was byron; when i was meredith's young man, and also that hero in a book by dostoevsky whose name i have forgotten. i found him alone, reading. a perfectly neat table; a curtain pulled methodically straight; a paper-knife dividing a french volume--nobody, i thought, ever changes the attitude in which we saw them first, or the clothes. here he has sat in this chair, in these clothes, ever since we first met. here was freedom; here was intimacy;

'yes, but suddenly one hears a clock tick. we who had been immersed in this world became aware of another. it is painful. it was neville who changed our time. he, who had been thinking with the unlimited time of the mind, which stretches in a flash from shakespeare to ourselves, poked the fire and began to live by that other clock which marks the approach of a particular person. the wide and dignified sweep of his mind contracted. he became on the alert. i could feel him listening to sounds in the street. i noted how he touched a cushion. from the myriads of mankind and all time past he had chosen one person, one moment in parti

'was this, then, this streaming away mixed with susan, jinny, neville, rhoda, louis, a sort of death? a new assembly of elements? some hint of what was to come? the note was scribbled, the book shut, for i am an intermittent student. i do not say my lessons by any means at the stated hour. later, walking down fleet street at the rush hour, i recalled that moment; i continued it.
