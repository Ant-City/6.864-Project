now unknown ingredient used in cookery; "galingale," sweet or
long rooted cyprus; "mortrewes", a rich soup made by stamping
flesh in a mortar; "blanc manger", not what is now called
blancmange; one part of it was the brawn of a capon.

suggested by some commentators to be a kind of pie, and by
others to be a fish)

2. sooth play quad play: true jest is no jest.

two stories; one on the way to canterbury, the other returning.

1. cheapside, where jousts were sometimes held, and which
was the great scene of city revels and processions.

2. his paper: his certificate of completion of his apprenticeship.

3. louke:  the precise meaning of the word is unknown, but it
is doubtless included in the cant term "pal".

4. the cook's tale is unfinished in all the manuscripts; but in
some, of minor authority, the cook is made to break off his
tale, because "it is so foul," and to tell the story of gamelyn, on
which shak

espeare's "as you like it" is founded. the story is
not chaucer's, and is different in metre, and inferior in
composition to the tales. it is supposed that chaucer expunged
the cook's tale for the same reason that made him on his death-
bed lament that he had written so much "ribaldry."

the prologue.


our hoste saw well that the brighte sun
th' arc of his artificial day had run
the fourthe part, and half an houre more;
and, though he were not deep expert in lore,
he wist it was the eight-and-twenty day
of april, that is messenger to may;
and saw well that the shadow of every tree
was in its length of the same quantity

and with that word he caught her by the flanks,
and her embraced hard, and kissed her oft.
"go now your way," quoth he, "all still and soft,
and let us dine as soon as that ye may,
for by my cylinder* 'tis prime of day;                 *portable sundial

"now elles god forbidde, sir," quoth she;
and forth she went, as jolly as a pie,

under the blee, in canterbury way?

the cook, that was full pale and nothing red,
said to host, "so god my soule bless,
as there is fall'n on me such heaviness,
i know not why, that me were lever* sleep,                       *rather

"well," quoth the manciple, "if it may do ease
to thee, sir cook, and to no wight displease
which that here rideth in this company,
and that our host will of his courtesy,
i will as now excuse thee of thy tale;
for in good faith thy visage is full pale:

thereto, me thinketh, ye be well y-shape.
i trow that ye have drunken wine of ape,<5>
and that is when men playe with a straw."

and with this speech the cook waxed all wraw,*                 *wrathful
and on the manciple he gan nod fast
for lack of speech; and down his horse him cast,
where as he lay, till that men him up took.
this was a fair chevachie* of a cook:                *cavalry expedition
alas! that he had held him by his ladle!
and ere that he again were in the saddle
there was great shoving bothe to and fro
to lift him up, and muche care and woe,
so unwieldy was this silly paled ghost.
and to the manciple then spake our host:
"because t

quoth the manciple, "that were a great mischief;
so might he lightly bring me in the snare.

this cook shall drink thereof, if that i may;
on pain of my life he will not say nay."
and certainly, to tellen as it was,
of this vessel the cook drank fast (alas!
what needed it? he drank enough beforn),
and when he hadde *pouped in his horn,*                        *belched*
to the manciple he took the gourd again.
and of that drink the cook was wondrous fain,
and thanked him in such wise as he could.

then gan our host to laughe wondrous loud,
and said, "i see well it is necessary

notes to the prologue to the manciple's tale


1. bob-up-and-down: mr wright supposes this to be the village of
harbledown, near canterbury, which  is situated on a hill, and near
which there are many ups and downs in the road. like boughton,
where the canon and his yeoman overtook the pilgrims, it stood on
the skirts of the kentish forest of blean or blee.

2. dun is in the mire: a proverbial saying. "dun" is a name for an
ass, derived from his colour.

3. the mention of the cook here, with no hint that he had already
told a story, confirms the indication given by the imperfect
condition of his tale, that chaucer intended to suppress the tale
altogether, and make him tell a story in some other place.

4. the quintain; called "fan" or "vane," because it turned round like
a weather-cock.

5. referring to the classification of wine, according to its effects on
a man, given in the old "calendrier des bergiers," the man of
choleric temperament has "wine of lion;" the sanguin

ape;" the phlegmatic, "wine of sheep;" the melancholic, "wine of
sow." there is a rabbinical tradition that, when noah was planting
vines, satan slaughtered beside them the four animals named; hence
the effect of wine in making those who drink it display in turn the
characteristics of all the four.

6. the pose:  a defluxion or rheum which stops the nose and
obstructs the voice.

7. bring thee to his lure: a phrase in hawking -- to recall a hawk to
the fist; the meaning here is, that the cook may one day bring the
manciple to account, or pay him off, for the rebuke of his
drunkenness.


the tale. <1>


when phoebus dwelled here in earth adown,
as olde bookes make mentioun,
he was the moste lusty* bacheler                               *pleasant
