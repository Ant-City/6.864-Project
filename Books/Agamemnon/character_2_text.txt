similar digressions generally are when they occur in greek plays, to the
poet feeling bound to follow the tradition. homer begins his longest

old? aeschylus adopts the latter view: why was this being called helena?
if one had understood god's purpose one would have seen it was because she
really _was_ "helenâs"--_ship-destroyer_. (the herald's story of the
