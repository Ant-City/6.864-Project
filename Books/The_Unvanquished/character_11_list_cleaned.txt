[CHARACTER] - 
      a cowardly ex-confederate soldier whose band of mauraders terrorizes the countryside in the wake of the yankee occupation. [CHARACTER] is the opposite of colonel sartoris: he preys on the local population rather than protecting them, and kills a defenseless old woman rather than fighting against the yankees. by killing him, bayard achieves more than personal revenge--he sets right the moral order for the entire community.
