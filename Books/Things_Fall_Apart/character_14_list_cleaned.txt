[CHARACTER] - 
                a
clan leader of umuofia. [CHARACTER] and mr. brown discuss their religious
beliefs peacefully, and [CHARACTER]'s influence on the missionary advances
mr. brown's strategy for converting the largest number of clansmen by
working with, rather than against, their belief system. in so doing,
however, [CHARACTER] formulates an articulate and rational defense of
his religious system and draws some striking parallels between his
style of worship and that of the christian missionaries.
