so stood the heaven when that we were born,

and with that word arcita *gan espy*               *began to look forth*
where as this lady roamed to and fro
and with that sight her beauty hurt him so,
that if that palamon was wounded sore,

notes to the knight's tale.


1. for the plan and principal incidents of the "knight's tale,"
chaucer was indebted to boccaccio, who had himself borrowed
from some prior poet, chronicler, or romancer.  boccaccio
speaks of the story as "very ancient;" and, though that may not
be proof of its antiquity, it certainly shows that he took it from
an earlier writer. the "tale" is more or less a paraphrase of

the morning.

62. in her hour: in the hour of the day (two hours before
daybreak) which after the astrological system that divided the
twenty-four among the seven ruling planets, was under the
influence of venus.

63. adon: adonis, a beautiful youth beloved of venus, whose
death by the tusk of a boar she deeply mourned.

64. the third hour unequal: in the third planetary hour;
palamon had gone forth in the hour of venus, two hours before
daybreak; the hour of mercury intervened; the third hour was
that of luna, or diana.  "unequal" refers to the astrological
division of day and night, whatever their duration, into twelve
parts, which of necessity varied in length with the season.

65. smoking: draping; hence the word "smock;" "smokless," in
chaucer, means naked.

notes to the cuckoo and the nightingale


1. these two lines occur also in the knight's tale; they
commence the speech of theseus on the love follies of palamon
and arcite, whom the duke has just found fighting in the forest.

2. a stronger reading is "all."

3. "ocy, ocy," is supposed to come from the latin "occidere,"
to kill; or rather the old french, "occire," "occis," denoting the
doom which the nightingale imprecates or supplicates on all
who do offence to love.

4. grede: cry; italian, "grido."

5."but if he be away therewith, y-wis,

unless he be always fortunate in love pursuits, he may full soon

nded when,
after "s'a mia voglia ardo," he wrote "s'a mal mio grado" = if
against my will; and urry's glossary points out the probability
that in transcription the words "if that maugre me" may have
gradually changed into "if harm agre me."

11. the third of may seems either to have possessed peculiar
favour or significance with chaucer personally, or to have had a
special importance in connection with those may observances
of which the poet so often speaks. it is on the third night of
may that palamon, in the knight's tale, breaks out of prison,
and at early morn encounters in the forest arcita, who has gone
forth to pluck a garland in honour of may; it is on the third
night of may that the poet hears the debate of "the cuckoo and
the nightingale"; and again in the present passage the favoured
date recurs.

12. went: turning; from anglo-saxon, "wendan;" german,
"wenden." the turning and tossing of uneasy lovers in bed is,
with chaucer, a favourite symptom of their passion. see the

prologue recites most of chaucer's principal
works, and glances, besides, at a long array of
other productions, too many to be fully catalogued.
but, on the other hand, it is objected that the
"legend" makes no mention of "the canterbury
tales" as such; while two of those tales -- the
knight's and the second nun's -- are enumerated
by the titles which they bore as separate
compositions, before they were incorporated in the
great collection: "the love of palamon and
arcite," and "the life of saint cecile" (see note 1
to the second nun's tale). tyrwhitt seems perfectly
justified in placing the composition of the poem
immediately before that of chaucer's magnum
opus, and after the marriage of richard ii to his
first queen, anne of bohemia. that event took
place in 1382; and since it is to anne that the poet
refers when he makes alcestis bid him give his
poem to the queen "at eltham or at sheen," the
"legend" could not have been written earlier. the
