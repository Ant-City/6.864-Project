such  as  trying  to  explain  this  or  that  piece  of  experimental  data.  instead,  he  was  driven  by  a
passionate belief that the deepest understanding of the universe would reveal its truest wonder: the
simplicity  and  power  of  the  principles  on  which  it  is  based.  einstein  wanted  to  illuminate  the
workings of the universe with a clarity never before achieved, allowing us all to stand in awe of its
sheer beauty and elegance.

einstein never realized this dream, in large part because the deck was stacked against him: in his
day, a number of essential features of matter and the forces of nature were either unknown or, at best,
poorly understood. but during the past half-century, physicists of each new generation—through fits
and starts, and diversions down blind alleys—have been building steadily on the discoveries of their
predecessors  to  piece  together  an  ever  fuller  understanding  of  how  the  univers

already revealed astonishing insights into the nature of space, time, and matter. the harmonious union
of  general  relativity  and  quantum  mechanics  is  a  major  success.  furthermore,  unlike  any  previous
theory, string theory has the capacity to answer primordial questions having to do with nature's most
fundamental constituents and forces. of equal importance, although somewhat harder to convey, is the
remarkable elegance of both the answers and the framework for answers that string theory proposes.
for instance, in string theory many aspects of nature that might appear to be arbitrary technical details
—such as the number of distinct fundamental particle ingredients and their respective properties—are
found to arise from essential and tangible aspects of the geometry of the universe. if string theory is
right, the microscopic fabric of our universe is a richly intertwined multidimensional labyrinth within

would cause his clock to tick at about 76 percent of the rate of gracie's. stronger gravitational fields,
such as those just outside a black hole (as discussed below), cause the flow of time to slow even
further; stronger gravitational fields cause a more severe warping of time.

experimental verification of general relativity

most people who study general relativity are captivated by its aesthetic elegance. by replacing the
cold,  mechanistic  newtonian  view  of  space,  time,  and  gravity  with  a  dynamic  and  geometric
description involving curved spacetime, einstein wove gravity into the basic fabric of the universe.
rather than being imposed as an additional structure, gravity becomes part and parcel of the universe
at its most fundamental level. breathing life into space and time by allowing them to curve, warp, and
ripple results in what we commonly refer to as gravity.

from  around  the  world.  these  works  showed  conclusively  that  numerous  features  of  the  standard
model—features  that  had  been  painstakingly  discovered  over  the  course  of  decades  of  research
—emerged naturally  and  simply  from  the  grand  structure  of  string  theory. as  michael  green  has
said, "the moment you encounter string theory and realize that almost all of the major developments
in physics over the last hundred years emerge—and emerge with such elegance—from such a simple
starting point, you realize that this incredibly compelling theory is in a class of its own."5 moreover,
for many of these features, as we shall discuss, string theory offers a far fuller and more satisfying
explanation than is found in the standard model. these developments convinced many physicists that
string theory was well on its way to fulfilling its promise of being the ultimate unified theory.

nstein about what he would have thought if eddington's experiment had not found
the predicted bending of starlight. einstein replied, "then i would have been sorry for the dear lord,
for the theory is correct."1 of course, had experiments truly failed to confirm einstein's predictions,
the  theory  would  not  be  correct  and  general  relativity  would  not  have  become  a  pillar  of  modern
physics. but what einstein meant is that general relativity describes gravity with such a deep inner
elegance, with such simple yet powerful ideas, that he found it hard to imagine that nature could pass
it by. general relativity, in einstein's view, was almost too beautiful to be wrong.

aesthetic  judgments  do  not  arbitrate  scientific  discourse,  however.  ultimately,  theories  are
judged  by  how  they  fare  when  faced  with  cold,  hard,  experimental  facts.  but  this  last  remark  is
subject to an immensely important qualification. while a theory is being constructed, its incomplete

resemble  anything  we  encounter  in  the  world  around  us.  but  it  is  certainly  the  case  that  some
decisions  made  by  theoretical  physicists  are  founded  upon  an  aesthetic  sense—a  sense  of  which
theories have an elegance and beauty of structure on par with the world we experience. of course,
nothing ensures that this strategy leads to truth. maybe, deep down, the universe has a less elegant
structure than our experiences have led us to believe, or maybe we will find that our current aesthetic
criteria need significant refining when applied in ever less familiar contexts. nevertheless, especially
as we enter an era in which our theories describe realms of the universe that are increasingly difficult

cribe these two properties of physical laws—that they do not depend on when or
where you use them—as symmetries of nature. by this usage physicists mean that nature treats every
moment in time and every location in space identically—symmetrically—by ensuring that the same

fundamental  laws  are  in  operation.  much  in  the  same  manner  that  they  affect  art  and  music,  such
symmetries are deeply satisfying; they highlight an order and a coherence in the workings of nature.
the elegance of rich, complex, and diverse phenomena emerging from a simple set of universal laws
is at least part of what physicists mean when they invoke the term "beautiful."

in  our  discussions  of  the  special  and  general  theories  of  relativity,  we  came  upon  yet  other
symmetries  of  nature.  recall  that  the  principle  of  relativity,  which  lies  at  the  heart  of  special
relativity, tells us that all physical laws must be the same regardless of the constant-velocity relative

plaints in the 1980s when string theory first made its splash, you would
have been joined by some of the most respected physicists of our age. for instance, in the mid-1980s
nobel  prize–winning  harvard  physicist  sheldon  glashow,  together  with  physicist  paul  ginsparg,
then also at harvard, publicly disparaged string theory's lack of experimental accessibility:

in lieu of the traditional confrontation between theory and experiment, superstring theorists
pursue an inner harmony, where elegance, uniqueness and beauty define truth. the theory
depends  for  its  existence  upon  magical  coincidences,  miraculous  cancellations  and
relations  among  seemingly  unrelated  (and  possibly  undiscovered)  fields  of  mathematics.
are  these  properties  reasons  to  accept  the  reality  of  superstrings?  do  mathematics  and
aesthetics supplant and transcend mere experiment?3

elsewhere, glashow went on to say,

superstring theory is so ambitious that it can only be totally right, or tot

e on explaining why our universe appears as it does.

this  line  of  argument  is  a  version  of  an  idea  with  a  long  history  known  as  the anthropic
principle. as presented, it is a perspective that is diametrically opposed to the dream of a rigid, fully
predictive,  unified  theory  in  which  things  are  the  way  they  are  because  the  universe  could  not  be
otherwise.  rather  than  being  the  epitome  of  poetic  grace  in  which  everything  fits  together  with
inflexible elegance, the multiverse and the anthropic principle paint a picture of a wildly excessive
collection  of  universes  with  an  insatiable  appetite  for  variety.  it  will  be  extremely  hard,  if  not
impossible, for us ever to know if the multiverse picture is true. even if there are other universes, we
can imagine that we will never come into contact with any of them. but by vastly increasing the scope
of "what's out there"—in a manner that dwarfs hubble's realization that the milky way is but o
