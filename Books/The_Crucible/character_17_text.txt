she come to this very door, beggin’ bread and a cup of cider - and 
mark this: whenever i turned her away empty, she mumbled. 
 
elizabeth: mumbled! she may mumble if she’s hungry.

mary  warren:  but  what  does  she  mumble?  you  must  re-member,  goody 
proctor. last month - a monday, i think - she walked away, and i thought my 
guts would burst for two days after. do you remember it? 
 
elizabeth: why - i do, i think, but - 
 
mary warren: and so i told that to judge hathorne, and he asks her so. “sarah 
good,” says he, “what curse do you mumble that this girl must fall sick after 
turning you away?” and then she replies - mimicking an old crone - "why, your 
excellence, no curse at all. i only say my commandments; i hope i may say my 
commandments,” says she! 
 
elizabeth: and that’s an upright answer. 
 
mary  warren:  aye,  but  then  judge  hathorne  say,  “recite  for  us  your 
commandments!” - leaning avidly toward them - and o

the door opens and giles is half carried into the vestry room by herrick. 
giles: hands off, damn you, let me go! 
herrick: giles, giles! 
giles: out of my way, herrick! i bring evidence - 
herrick: you cannot go in there, giles; it’s a court! 
enter hale from the court. 
hale: pray be calm a moment. 
giles: you, mr. hale, go in there and demand i speak. 
hale: a moment, sir, a moment.

judge hathorne enters. he is in his sixties, a bitter, remorseless salem judge. 
 
hathorne:  how  do  you  dare  come  roarin’ into  this  court!  are  you  gone  daft, 
corey? 
 
giles: you’re not a boston judge yet, hathorne. you’ll not call me daft! 
 
enter deputy governor danforth and, behind him, ezekiel cheever and parris. 
on his appearance, silence falls. danforth is a grave man in his sixties, of some 
humor and sophistication that does not, however, interfere with an exact loyalty

francis: excellency, we have proof for your eyes; god forbid you shut them to it. the 
girls, sir, the girls are frauds. 
 
danforth: what’s that? 
 
francis: we have proof of it, sir. they are all deceiving you. 
 
danforth is shocked, but studying francis. 
 
hathorne: this is contempt, sir, contempt! 
 
danforth: peace, judge hathorne. do you know who i am, mr. nurse? 
 
francis: i surely do, sir, and i think you must be a wise judge to be what you 
are. 
 
danforth:  and  do  you  know  that  near  to  four  hundred  are  in  the  jails  from 
marblehead to lynn, and upon my signature? 
 
francis: i - 
 
danforth: and seventy-two condemned to hang by that signature? 
 
francis: excellency, i never thought to say it to such a weighty judge, but you 
are deceived.

g now, out with you! 
 
tituba, calling to the window: take me home, devil! take me home! 
 
sarah  good,  following  the  shouting  tituba  out:  tell  him  i’m  goin’,  tituba! 
now you tell him sarah good is goin’ too! 
 
in the corridor outside tituba calls on - “take me home, devil; devil take me 
home!” and hopkins’ voice orders her to move on. herrick returns and begins 
to push old rags and straw into a corner. hearing footsteps, he turns, and enter 
danforth and judge hathorne. they are in greatcoats and wear hats against 
the bitter cold. they are followed in by cheever, who carries a dispatch case 
and a flat wooden box containing his writing materials. 
herrick good morning, excellency. danforth: where is mr. 
parris? 
herrick: i’ll fetch him. he starts for the door. 
 
danforth: marshal. herrick stops. when did reverend hale arrive? 
herrick: it were toward midnight, i think. 
danforth, suspiciously: %hat is he about here? 
 
herrick: he goes among them that

ith  farmers  all  yesterday  -  there  is  great  contention,  sir,  about  the  cows. 
contention make him weep, sir; it were always a man that weep for contention. he 
turns,  as  do  hathorne  and  danforth,  hearing  someone  coming  up  the  corridor. 
danforth raises his head as parris enters. he is gaunt, frightened, and sweating in his 
greatcoat. 
 
parris, to danforth, instantly: oh, good morning, sir, thank you 
' for coming, i beg your pardon wakin’ you so early. good morn-ing, judge hathorne. 
 

danforth: reverend hale have no right to enter this - 
 
parris: excellency, a moment. he hurries back and shuts the door. 
 
hathorne: do you leave him alone with the prisoners? 
 
danforth: what’s his business here? 
 
parris,  prayerfully  holding  up  his  hands:  excellency,  hear  me.  it  is  a  providence. 
reverend hale has returned to bring rebecca nurse to god. 
 
danforth, surprised: he bids her confess? 
 
parris, sitting: hear me. rebecca have not given me a word this thr
