dictionary.  carried  that  dictionary  all  over  hell  with  him.  he'd  look  in  it  while  he's 
pulled up gettin' his pie an' coffee." he stopped, feeling lonely in the long speech. his 
secret eyes turned on his passenger. joad remained silent. nervously the driver tried to 
force him into participation. "ever know a guy that said big words like that?" 

"now don't get sore. i just like to notice things. makes the time pass." 
"i'll tell you anything. name's joad, tom joad. old man is ol' tom joad." his eyes 

"preacher," said joad. 
"well, it makes you mad to hear a guy use big words. 'course with a preacher it's all 
right  because  nobody  would  fool  around  with  a  preacher  anyway.  but  this  guy  was 
funny. you didn't give a damn when he said a big word 'cause he just done it for ducks. 
he wasn't puttin' on no dog." the driver was reassured. he knew at least that joad was 
listening. he swung the great truck viciously around a bend and the tires shril

ht seemed to go far into his brown eyes, and it 
picked out little golden specks deep in the irises. the strained bundle of neck muscles 
stood out. 

joad stood still in the speckled shade. he took off his cap and mopped his wet face 

with it and dropped it and his rolled coat on the ground. 

the man in the absolute shade uncrossed his legs and dug with his toes at the earth. 
joad said, "hi. it's hotter'n hell on the road." 

the seated man stared questioningly at him. "now ain't you young tom joadâ€”ol' 

tom's boy?" 

"yeah," said joad. "all the way. goin' home now." 
"you  wouldn't  remember  me,  i  guess,"  the  man  said.  he  smiled  and  his  full  lips 
revealed great horse teeth. "oh, no, you wouldn't remember. you was always too busy 
pullin' little girls' pigtails when i give you the holy sperit. you was all wropped up in 
yankin' that pigtail out by the roots. you maybe don't recollect, but i do. the two of 
you come to jesus at once 'cause of the pigtail yankin'. baptized bo

"i got to worryin' about whether in messin' around maybe 
i done somebody a hurt." 

joad looked over toward his coat and saw the turtle, free of the cloth and hurrying 
away in the direction he had been following when joad found him. joad watched him 
for a moment and then got slowly to his feet and retrieved him and wrapped him in the 
coat again. "i ain't got no present for the kids," he said. "nothin' but this ol' turtle." 

"it's a funny thing," the preacher said. "i was thinkin' about ol' tom joad when you 
come along. thinkin' i'd call in on him. i used to think he was a godless man. how is 
tom?" 

"i don't know how he is. i ain't been home in four years." 
"didn't he write to you?" 
joad was embarrassed. "well, pa wasn't no hand to write for pretty, or to write for 
writin'. he'd sign up his name as nice as anybody, an' lick his pencil. but pa never did 
write  no  letters.  he  always  says  what  he  couldn'  tell  a  fella  with  his  mouth  wasn't

why, the first fella ain't got no choice. i mean, s'pose i pick up my rabbits an' go off 
somewheres an' eat 'em. see?" 

"i see," said casy. "i can see that. muley sees somepin there, tom. muley's got a-

holt of somepin, an' it's too big for him, an' it's too big for me." 

young  tom  rubbed  his  hands  together.  "who  got  a  knife?  le's  get  at  these  here 

miserable rodents. le's get at 'em." 

muley reached in his pants pocket and produced a large horn-handled pocket knife. 
tom joad took it from him, opened a blade, and smelled it. he drove the blade again 
and again into the ground and smelled it again, wiped it on his trouser leg, and felt the 
edge with his thumb. 

muley took a quart bottle of water out of his hip pocket and set it on the porch. "go 

easy on that there water," he said. "that's all there is. this here well's filled in." 

tom took up a rabbit in his hand. "one of you go get some bale wire outa the barn. 
we'll make a fire with some a this broken plank

the  sky  grayed  among  the  stars,  and  the  pale,  late  quarter-moon  was  insub-
stantial and thin. tom joad and the preacher walked quickly along a road that was only 
wheel tracks and beaten caterpillar tracks through a cotton field. only the unbalanced 
sky showed the approach of dawn, no horizon to the west, and a line to the east. the 
two men walked in silence and smelled the dust their feet kicked into the air. 

"i  hope  you're  dead  sure  of  the  way,"  jim  casy  said.  "i'd  hate  to  have  the  dawn 
come  and  us  be  way  to  hell  an'  gone  somewhere."  the  cotton  field  scurried

 up on 'em, like," and he walked so fast that the 
dust rose high as his waist. and then he came to the edge of the cotton field. now they 
were in the yard proper, earth beaten hard, shiny hard, and a few dusty crawling weeds 
on the ground. and joad slowed as though he feared to go on. the preacher, watching 
him, slowed to match his step. tom sauntered forward, sidled embarrassedly toward 
the truck. it was a hudson super-six sedan, and the top had been ripped in two with a 
cold chisel. old tom joad stood in the truck bed and he was nailing on the top rails of 
the truck sides. his grizzled, bearded face was low over his work, and a bunch of six-
penny nails stuck out of his mouth. he set a nail and his hammer thundered it in. from 
the house came the clash of a lid on the stove and the wail of a child. joad sidled up to 
the truck bed and leaned against it. and his father looked at him and did not see him. 
his father set another nail and drove it in. a flock of pigeons started from the d

ma demanded, "you got wash tubsâ€”running water?"

"oh! praise god," said ma. 

al dropped off the truck and walked around. "gonna stay here?" 
"yeah," said tom. "you an' pa unload while i go to the office." 
"be kinda quiet," the watchman said. "they's a lot of folks sleeping." 
tom followed through the dark and climbed the office steps and entered a tiny room 
containing an old desk and a chair. the guard sat down at the desk and took out a form. 

"name?" 
"tom joad." 
"that your father?" 
"yeah." 
"his name?" 
"tom joad, too." 
the questions went on. where from, how long in the state, what work done. the 

watchman looked up. "i'm not nosy. we got to have this stuff." 

"sure," said tom. 
"nowâ€”got any money?" 
"little bit." 
"you ain't destitute?" 
"got a little. why?" 
"well,  the  camp  site  costs  a  dollar  a  week,  but  you  can  work  it  out,  carrying 

garbage, keeping the camp cleanâ€”stuff like that." 

"we'll work it out," said tom.

"yep, yep. got to make up my rent." 
"rent, hell!" the young man said. "he was drunk last sat'dy night. sung in his tent 
all night. committee give him work for it." they walked along the edge of the oiled 
road;  a  row  of  walnut  trees  grew  beside  the  way.  the  sun  shoved  its  edge  over  the 
mountains.

the older man looked at him, and then he smiled a little. "you ain't been out here

ite farm house, a few 
shade trees, and a barn; behind the barn a vineyard and a field of cotton. as the three 
men walked past the house a screen door banged, and a stocky sunburned man came 
down the back steps. he wore a paper sun helmet, and he rolled up his sleeves as he 
came across the yard. his heavy sunburned eyebrows were drawn down in a scowl. his 
cheeks were sunburned a beef red. 

"mornin', mr. thomas," timothy said. 
"morning." the man spoke irritably. 
timothy said, "this here's tom joad. we wondered if you could see your way to 

put him on?" 

thomas scowled at tom. and then he laughed shortly, and his brows still scowled. 

"oh, sure! i'll put him on. i'll put everybody on. maybe i'll get a hundred men on." 

"we jus' thoughtâ€”" timothy began apologetically. 
thomas  interrupted  him.  "yes,  i  been  thinkin'  too."  he  swung  around  and  faced 
them. "i've got some things to tell you. i been paying you thirty cents an hourâ€”that 
right?"

"now you stop," rose of sharon said, and she went inside the tent, out of sight. 
ma chuckled, "you shouldn' ought to worry her." 
"she likes it," said tom. 
"i know she likes it, but it worries her, too. and she's a-mournin' for connie." 

"well,  she  might's  well  give  him  up.  he's  prob'ly  studyin'  to  be  president  of  the 

united states by now." 

"don't worry her," ma said. "she ain't got no easy row to hoe."

"yeah."

look over the guys when they come in, an' try to spot 'em. you'll be with another fella. 
then later i want ya to dance an' watch."

canvas walls. tom climbed a fence and moved down into the ravine through brush and 
dwarf willows; and in the bottom, beside a tiny stream, he found a trail. a man sat on a 
box in front of the tent. 
"evenin'," tom said. 
"who are you?" 
"wellâ€”i guess, wellâ€”i'm jus' goin' past." 
"know anybody here?" 
"no. i tell you i was jus' goin' past." 
a head stuck out of the tent. a voice said, "what's the matter?" 
"casy!" tom cried. "casy! for chris' sake, what you doin' here?" 
"why, my god, it's tom joad! come on in, tommy. come on in." 
"know him, do ya?" the man in front asked. 
"know him? christ, yes. knowed him for years. i come west with him. come on in, 

tom." he clutched tom's elbow and pulled him into the tent. 

three other men sat on the ground, and in the center of the tent a lantern burned. 
the men looked up suspiciously. a dark-faced, scowling man held out his hand. "glad 
to meet ya," he said. "i heard what casy said. this the fella you was tellin' about?" 

"sure. this is him.
