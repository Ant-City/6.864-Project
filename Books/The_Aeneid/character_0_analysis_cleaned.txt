[CHARACTER]
as the son of the trojan mortal anchises and venus, the
goddess of beauty and erotic love, [CHARACTER] enjoys a special divine
protection. he is chosen to survive the siege of troy and to lay
the foundations in italy for the glory of the roman empire. in the aeneid, [CHARACTER]'s
fate as rome's founder drives all the action, and the narrative
constantly points out that [CHARACTER]'s heroism owes as much to his
legacy as to his own actions. [CHARACTER] serves as the vehicle through
which fate carries out its historical design.

as a trojan leader, [CHARACTER] respects prophecy
and attempts to incorporate the idea of his own destiny into his
actions, in spite of emotional impulses that conflict with his fated
duties. his ability to accept his destined path despite his unhappiness
in doing so makes him a graceful hero and a worthy recipient of
the honor and favor the gods bestow upon him. his compassion for
the sufferings of others, even in conjunction with a single-minded
devotion to his duty, is another aspect of his heroism. sympathetic
to the weariness of others on the journey, he delivers speeches
to his fleet to keep the men's spirits high.
[CHARACTER]'s personal investment in the future of rome increases
as the story progresses. the events of book v, in which the trojans
sail away from carthage toward italy, and book vi, in which [CHARACTER] visits
his father in the realm of the dead, depict [CHARACTER]'s growth as a leader.
in book v, he shows his sympathy for the woes of others by allowing
the crippled and unwilling to stay behind. he also grows in compassion
in the underworld when he observes the lot of the unburied dead.
he carries these lessons into the war that follows, taking care
to ensure the proper burial of both ally and enemy.
when, in the underworld, [CHARACTER]'s father, anchises, presents
a tableau of the events that will lead to rome's pinnacle, [CHARACTER] comes
to understand his historical role with greater clarity and immediacy.
the scenes depicted later in the epic on the shield made by vulcan
further focus [CHARACTER]'s sentiments and actions toward his destined
future. there are moments, of course, when [CHARACTER] seems to lose
track of his destiny--particularly during his dalliance with dido
in carthage. [CHARACTER] is recalled to his duty in this case not by
a long historical vision, but by an appeal from jupiter to his obligation
to his son, ascanius, to whom [CHARACTER] is devoted.
even prior to virgil's treatment of the trojan war, [CHARACTER]
held a place in the classical tradition as a figure of great piety,
just as ulysses was known for his cunning and achilles for his rage
in battle. the value [CHARACTER] places on family is particularly evident
in the scene in which he escorts his father and son out of troy,
bearing his elderly father on his back. he behaves no less honorably
toward the gods, earnestly seeking to find out their wishes and
conform to them as fully as possible. his words to dido in books iv
and vi express his commitment to obey fate rather than indulge his
feelings of genuine romantic love. this subordination of personal
desire to duty defines [CHARACTER]'s character and earns him the repeated
moniker "pious [CHARACTER]." his behavior contrasts with juno's and turnus's
in this regard, as those characters both fight fate every step of
the way.
