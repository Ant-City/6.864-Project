to the young man's face; 
he dropped his eyes, raised them again for a moment only to find her 
still smiling at him, and was so much overcome that he had to turn 
away and pretend to be looking very hard at something on the other 
side of the square. 



bernard's questions made a diversion. who? how? when? from 
where? keeping his eyes fixed on bernard's face (for so passionately 
did he long to see lenina smiling that he simply dared not look at her), 
the young man tried to explain himself. linda and he-linda was his 
mother (the word made lenina look uncomfortable)-were strangers in 
the reservation. linda had come from the other place long ago, before 
he was born, with a man who was his father. (bernard pricked up his 
ears.) she had gone walking alone in those mountains over there to 
the north, had fallen down a steep place and hurt her head. ("go on, 
go on," said bernard excitedly.) some hunters from malpais had found 
her and brought her to the pueblo. as for the man who was his

 father, 
linda had never seen him again. his name was tomakin. (yes, "tho- 
mas" was the d.h.c.'s first name.) he must have flown away, back to 
the other place, away without her-a bad, unkind, unnatural man. 
"and so i was born in malpais," he concluded. "in malpais." and he 
shook his head.

a space of dust and rubbish separated it from the village. two famine- 
stricken dogs were nosing obscenely in the garbage at its door. inside,

"linda!" the young man called. 

from the inner room a rather hoarse female voice said, "coming." 
they waited. in bowls on the floor were the remains of a meal, per- 
haps of several meals. 

the door opened. a very stout blonde squaw stepped across the 
threshold and stood looking at the strangers staring incredulously, her 
mouth open. lenina noticed with disgust that two of the front teeth 
were missing. and the colour of the ones that remained ... she shud- 
dered. it was worse than the old man.

gestion made lenina shudder.) 
"though it wasn't my fault, i swear; because i still don't know how it 
happened, seeing that i did all the malthusian drill-you know, by 
numbers, one, two, three, four, always, i swear it; but all the same it 
happened, and of course there wasn't anything like an abortion centre 
here. is it still down in chelsea, by the way?" she asked. lenina nod- 
ded. "and still floodlighted on tuesdays and fridays?" lenina nodded 
again. "that lovely pink glass tower!" poor linda lifted her face and 
with closed eyes ecstatically contemplated the bright remembered im- 
age. "and the river at night," she whispered. great tears oozed slowly 
out from behind her tight-shut eyelids. "and flying back in the evening 
from stoke poges. and then a hot bath and vibro-vacuum massage ... 
but there." she drew a deep breath, shook her head, opened her eyes 
again, sniffed once or twice, then blew her nose on her fingers and 
wiped them on the skirt of her tunic. "oh, i'm so sorry,"

r averted head, let out the breath she had been hold- 
ing and managed to draw another one, relatively untainted. "well, 
here," the other went on, "nobody's supposed to belong to more than 
one person. and if you have people in the ordinary way, the others 
think you're wicked and anti-social. they hate and despise you. once a 
lot of women came and made a scene because their men came to see 
me. well, why not? and then they rushed at me ... no, it was too aw- 
ful. i can't tell you about it." linda covered her face with her hands 
and shuddered. "they're so hateful, the women here. mad, mad and 
cruel. and of course they don't know anything about malthusian drill, 
or bottles, or decanting, or anything of that sort. so they're having 
children all the time-like dogs. it's too revolting. and to think that i ...

shook his head. "it's almost inconceivable. i shall never understand, 
unless you explain." 

"explain what?" 

"this." he indicated the pueblo. "that." and it was the little house out- 
side the village. "everything. all your life." 

"but what is there to say?" 

"from the beginning. as far back as you can remember." 

"as far back as i can remember." john frowned. there was a long si- 
lence. 

it was very hot. they had eaten a lot of tortillas and sweet corn. linda 
said, "come and lie down, baby." they lay down together in the big 



bed. "sing," and linda sang. sang "streptocock-gee to banbury-t" and 
"bye baby banting, soon you'll need decanting." her voice got fainter 
and fainter ... 

there was a loud noise, and he woke with a start. a man was saying 
something to linda, and linda was laughing. she had pulled the blan- 
ket up to her chin, but the man pulled it down again. his hair was like 
two black ropes, and round his arm was a lovely silver br

acelet with 
blue stones in it. he liked the bracelet; but all the same, he was fright- 
ened; he hid his face against linda's body. linda put her hand on him 
and he felt safer. in those other words he did not understand so well, 
she said to the man, "not with john here." the man looked at him, 
then again at linda, and said a few words in a soft voice. linda said, 
"no." but the man bent over the bed towards him and his face was 
huge, terrible; the black ropes of hair touched the blanket. "no," linda 
said again, and he felt her hand squeezing him more tightly. "no, no!" 
but the man took hold of one of his arms, and it hurt. he screamed. 
the man put up his other hand and lifted him up. linda was still hold- 
ing him, still saying, "no, no." the man said something short and an- 
gry, and suddenly her hands were gone. "linda, linda." he kicked and

wriggled; but the man carried him across to the door, opened it, put 
him down on the floor in the middle of the other room, and went away, 
shutting the door behind him. he got up, he ran to the door. standing 
on tiptoe he could just reach the big wooden latch. he lifted it and 
pushed; but the door wouldn't open. "linda," he shouted. she didn't 
answer. 

he remembered a huge room, rather dark; and there were big wooden 
things with strings fastened to them, and lots of women standing 
round them-making blankets, linda said. linda told him to sit in the 
corner with the other children, while she went and helped the women. 
he played with the little boys for a long time. suddenly people started 
talking very loud, and there were the women pushing linda away, and 
linda was crying. she went to the door and he ra

n after her. he asked 
her why they were angry. "because i broke something," she said. and 
then she got angry too. "how should i know how to do their beastly 
weaving?" she said. "beastly savages." he asked her what savages 
were. when they got back to their house, pope was waiting at the 
door, and he came in with them. he had a big gourd full of stuff that 
looked like water; only it wasn't water, but something with a bad smell 



that burnt your mouth and made you cough. linda drank some and 
pope drank some, and then linda laughed a lot and talked very loud; 
and then she and pope went into the other room. when pope went 
away, he went into the room. linda was in bed and so fast asleep that 
he couldn't wake her. 

pope used to come often. he said the stuff in the gourd was called 
mescal; but linda said it ought to be called soma; only it made you 
feel ill afterwards. he hated pope. he hated them all-all the men who 
came to see linda. one afternoon, when he had b

een playing with the 
other children-it was cold, he remembered, and there was snow on 
the mountains-he came back to the house and heard angry voices in 
the bedroom. they were women's voices, and they said words he 
didn't understand, but he knew they were dreadful words. then sud- 
denly, crash! something was upset; he heard people moving about 
quickly, and there was another crash and then a noise like hitting a 
mule, only not so bony; then linda screamed. "oh, don't, don't, 
don't!" she said. he ran in. there were three women in dark blankets. 
linda was on the bed. one of the women was holding her wrists. an- 
other was lying across her legs, so that she couldn't kick. the third 
was hitting her with a whip. once, twice, three times; and each time 
linda screamed. crying, he tugged at the fringe of the woman's blan- 
ket. "please, please." with her free hand she held him away. the whip 
came down again, and again linda screamed. he ca

ught hold of the 
woman's enormous brown hand between his own and bit it with all his 
might. she cried out, wrenched her hand free, and gave him such a 
push that he fell down. while he was lying on the ground she hit him 
three times with the whip. it hurt more than anything he had ever 
felt-like fire. the whip whistled again, fell. but this time it was linda 
who screamed. 

"but why did they want to hurt you, linda?" he asked that night. he 
was crying, because the red marks of the whip on his back still hurt so 
terribly. but he was also crying because people were so beastly and 
unfair, and because he was only a little boy and couldn't do anything 
against them. linda was crying too. she was grown up, but she wasn't 
big enough to fight against three of them. it wasn't fair for her either. 
"why did they want to hurt you, linda?" 

"i don't know. how should i know?" it was difficult to hear what she

id, because she was lying on her stomach and her face was in the 



pillow. "they say those men are their men," she went on; and she did 
not seem to be talking to him at all; she seemed to be talking with 
some one inside herself. a long talk which she didn't understand; and 
in the end she started crying louder than ever. 

"oh, don't cry, linda. don't cry." 

he pressed himself against her. he put his arm round her neck. linda 
cried out. "oh, be careful. my shoulder! oh!" and she pushed him 
away, hard. his head banged against the wall. "little idiot!" she 
shouted; and then, suddenly, she began to slap him. slap, slap ... 

"linda," he cried out. "oh, mother, don't!" 

"i'm not your mother. i won't be your mother." 

"but, linda ... oh!" she slapped him on the cheek. 

"turned into a savage," she shouted. "having young ones like an ani- 
mal ... if it hadn't been for you, i might have gone to the inspector, i

shameful." 

he saw that she was going to hit him again, and lifted his arm to guard 
his face. "oh, don't, linda, please don't." 

"little beast!" she pulled down his arm; his face was uncovered. 

"don't, linda." he shut his eyes, expecting the blow. 

but she didn't hit him. after a little time, he opened his eyes again and 
saw that she was looking at him. he tried to smile at her. suddenly she 
put her arms round him and kissed him again and again. 

sometimes, for several days, linda didn't get up at all. she lay in bed 
and was sad. or else she drank the stuff that pope brought and 
laughed a great deal and went to sleep. sometimes she was sick. of- 
ten she forgot to wash him, and there was noth

laguna and the great eagle and our lady of acoma. strange stories, 
all the more wonderful to him for being told in the other words and so 
not fully understood. lying in bed, he would think of heaven and lon- 
don and our lady of acoma and the rows and rows of babies in clean 
bottles and jesus flying up and linda flying up and the great director 
of world hatcheries and awonawilona. 

lots of men came to see linda. the boys began to point their fingers 
at him. in the strange other words they said that linda was bad; they 
called her names he did not understand, but that he knew were bad 
names. one day they sang a song about her, again and again. he 
threw stones at them. they threw back; a sharp stone cut his cheek. 
the blood wouldn't stop; he was covered with blood.

learned quickly and easily. when he knew how to read all the words 
she wrote on the wall, linda opened her big wooden box and pulled 
out from under those funny little red trousers she never wore a thin lit- 
tle book. he had often seen it before. "when you're bigger," she had 
said, "you can read it." well, now he was big enough. he was proud. 
"i'm afraid you won't find it very exciting," she said. "but it's the only 
thing i have." she sighed. "if only you could see the lovely reading

tions for beta embryo-store workers. it took him a quarter of an hour 
to read the title alone. he threw the book on the floor. "beastly, 
beastly book!" he said, and began to cry. 

the boys still sang their horrible song about linda. sometimes, too, 
they laughed at him for being so ragged. when he tore his clothes, 
linda did not know how to mend them. in the other place, she told 
him, people threw away clothes with holes in them and got new ones. 
"rags, rags!" the boys used to shout at him. "but i can read," he said 
to himself, "and they can't. they don't even know what reading is." it 
was fairly easy, if he thought hard enough about the reading, to pre- 
tend that he didn't mind when they made fun of him. he asked linda 
to give him the book again. 

the more the boys pointed and sang, the harder he read.

could read all the words quite well. even the longest. but what did 
they mean? he asked linda; but even when she could answer it didn't 
seem to make it very clear, and generally she couldn't answer at all. 

"what are chemicals?" he would ask. 

"oh, stuff like magnesium salts, and alcohol for keeping the deltas and 
epsilons small and backward, and calcium carbonate for bones, and all 
that sort of thing." 

"but how do you make chemicals, linda? where do they come from?" 

"well, i don't know. you get them out of bottles. and when the bottles 
are empty, you send up to the chemical store for more. it's the 
chemical store people who make them, i suppose. or else they send 
to the factory for them. i don't know. i never did any chemistry. my 



job was always with the embryos. it was the same with everything 
else he asked about. linda never seemed to know. the old men of the 
pueblo had much more definite answers.

to grow ..." 

one day (john calculated later that it must have been soon after his 
twelfth birthday) he came home and found a book that he had never 
seen before lying on the floor in the bedroom. it was a thick book and 
looked very old. the binding had been eaten by mice; some of its 
pages were loose and crumpled. he picked it up, looked at the title- 
page: the book was called the complete works of william shake- 
speare. 

linda was lying on the bed, sipping that horrible stinking mescal out of 
a cup. "pope brought it," she said. her voice was thick and hoarse like 
somebody else's voice. "it was lying in one of the chests of the ante- 
lope kiva. it's supposed to have been there for hundreds of years. i 
expect it's true, because i looked at it, and it seemed to be full of non- 
sense. uncivilized. still, it'll be good enough for you to practice your

carved sticks and his bits of bone and stone-kiathla tsilu silokwe si-

cause it meant more, because it talked to him, talked wonderfully and 
only half-understandably, a terrible beautiful magic, about linda; 
about linda lying there snoring, with the empty cup on the floor beside 
the bed; about linda and pope, linda and pope. 
he hated pope more and more. a man can smile and smile and be a 
villain. remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain. what did 
the words exactly mean? he only half knew. but their magic was 
strong and went on rumbling in his head, and somehow it was as 
though he had never really hated pope before; never really hated him 
because he had never been able to say h

now he had these words, these words like drums and singing and 
magic. these words and the strange, strange story out of which they 
were taken (he couldn't make head or tail of it, but it was wonderful, 
wonderful all the same)-they gave him a reason for hating pope; and 
they made his hatred more real; they even made pope himself more 
real. 

one day, when he came in from playing, the door of the inner room 
was open, and he saw them lying together on the bed, asleep-white 
linda and pope almost black beside her, with one arm under her 
shoulders and the other dark hand on her breast, and one of the plaits 
of his long hair lying across her throat, like a black snake trying to 
strangle her. pope's gourd and a cup were standing on the floor near 
the bed. linda was snoring. 

his heart seemed to have disappeared and left a hole. he was empty. 
empty, and cold, and rather sick, and giddy. he leaned against the wall 
to steady himself. remorseless, treacherous, lecherous

more, but found his wrist caught, held and-oh, oh!-twisted. he 
couldn't move, he was trapped, and there were pope's small black 
eyes, very close, staring into his own. he looked away. there were two 
cuts on pope's left shoulder. "oh, look at the blood!" linda was crying. 
"look at the blood!" she had never been able to bear the sight of 
blood. pope lifted his other hand-to strike him, he thought. he stiff- 
ened to receive the blow. but the hand only took him under the chin 
and turned his face, so that he had to look again into pope's eyes. for 
a long time, for hours and hours. and suddenly-he couldn't help it-he 
began to cry. pope burst out laughing. "go," he said, in the other in- 
dian words. "go, my brave ahaiyuta." he ran out into the other

a pinch of corn meal lay white on the palm; he breathed on it, mur-

sun. kiakime did the same. then khakime's father stepped forward, 
and holding up a feathered prayer stick, made a long prayer, then 
threw the stick after the corn meal. 

"it is finished," said old mitsima in a loud voice. "they are married." 
"well," said linda, as they turned away, "all i can say is, it does seem 
a lot of fuss to make about so little. in civilized countries, when a boy 
wants to have a girl, he just ... but where are you going, john?" 
he paid no attention to her calling, but ran on, away, away, anywhere 
to be by himself.

he had discovered time and death and god. 
"alone, always alone," the young man was saying. 
the words awoke a plaintive echo in bernard's mind. alone, alone ... 
"so am i," he said, on a gush of confidingness. "terribly alone." 
"are you?" john looked surprised. "i thought that in the other place ... 
i mean, linda always said that nobody was ever alone there." 
bernard blushed uncomfortably. "you see," he said, mumbling and with 
averted eyes, "i'm rather different from most people, i suppose. if one 
happens to be decanted different ..." 

"yes, that's just it." the young man nodded. "if one's different, one's

"i wonder if you'd like to come back to london with us?" he asked, 
making the first move in a campaign whose strategy he had been se- 
cretly elaborating ever since, in the little house, he had realized who 
the "father" of this young savage must be. "would you like that?" 
the young man's face lit up. "do you really mean it?" 
"of course; if i can get permission, that is." 
"linda too?" 

"well ..." he hesitated doubtfully. that revolting creature! no, it was 
impossible. unless, unless ... it suddenly occurred to bernard that her 
very revoltingness might prove an enormous asset. "but of course!" he 
cried, making up for his first hesitations with an excess of noisy cor- 
diality. 

the young man drew a deep breath. "to think it should be coming

says?" 

"who's miranda?"

"certainly. but it's in the passage. one moment." bernard hurried to 
the door and threw it open. "come in," he commanded, and the reason 
came in and showed itself. 

there was a gasp, a murmur of astonishment and horror; a young girl 
screamed; standing on a chair to get a better view some one upset 
two test-tubes full of spermatozoa. bloated, sagging, and among those 
firm youthful bodies, those undistorted faces, a strange and terrifying 
monster of middle-agedness, linda advanced into the room, coquet- 
tishly smiling her broken and discoloured smile, and rolling as she 
walked, with what was meant to be a voluptuous undulation, her 
enormous haunches. bernard walked beside her. 

"there he is," he said, pointing at the director. 

"did you think i didn't recognize him?" linda asked indignantly; then, 
turning to the director, "of course i knew you; tomakin, i should have

expression of petrified disgust, less and less self-confident, that wa-

peated in a voice that trembled. her eyes were anxious, agonized. the

stopped struggling and stood, his hands on her wrists, staring down at 
her, horrified. "yes, a baby-and i was its mother." she flung the ob-

chapter eleven 



after the scene in the fertilizing room, all upper-caste london was 
wild to see this delicious creature who had fallen on his knees before 
the director of hatcheries and conditioning-or rather the ex-director, 
for the poor man had resigned immediately afterwards and never set 
foot inside the centre again-had flopped down and called him (the 
joke was almost too good to be true!) "my father." linda, on the con- 
trary, cut no ice; nobody had the smallest desire to see linda. to say 
one was a mother-that was past a joke: it was an obscenity. moreover, 
she wasn't a real savage, had been hatched out of a bottle and condi- 
tioned like any one else: so couldn't have really quaint ideas. final- 
ly-and this was by far the strongest reason for people's not wanting to 
see poor linda-there was her appearance. fat; having lost her youth;

simply couldn't look at her without feeling sick, yes, positively sick. so 
the best people were quite determined not to see linda. and linda, for 
her part, had no desire to see them. the return to civilization was for 
her the return to soma, was the possibility of lying in bed and taking 
holiday after holiday, without ever having to come back to a headache 
or a fit of vomiting, without ever being made to feel as you always felt 
after peyotl, as though you'd done something so shamefully anti-social 
that you could never hold up your head again. soma played none of 
these unpleasant tricks. the holiday it gave was perfect and, if

frequent doses. dr. shaw at first demurred; then let her have what she 
wanted. she took as much as twenty grammes a day. 

"which will finish her off in a month or two," the doctor confided to 
bernard. "one day the respiratory centre will be paralyzed. no more 
breathing. finished. and a good thing too. if we could rejuvenate, of 
course it would be different. but we can't." 

surprisingly, as every one thought (for on soma-holiday linda was 
most conveniently out of the way), john raised objections. 

"but aren't you shortening her life by giving her so much?" 

"in one sense, yes," dr. shaw admitted. "but in another we're actually 
lengthening it." the young man stared, uncomprehending. "soma may 
make you lose a few years in time," the doctor went on. "but think of 
the enormous, immeasurable durations it can give you out of time. 
every soma-holiday is a bit of what our ancestors used to call eter- 
nity." 

john began to u

murmured. 

"eh?" 

"nothing." 

"of course," dr. shaw went on, "you can't allow people to go popping 
off into eternity if they've got any serious work to do. but as she 
hasn't got any serious work ..." 

"all the same," john persisted, "i don't believe it's right." 

the doctor shrugged his shoulders. "well, of course, if you prefer to 
have her screaming mad all the time ..." 

in the end john was forced to give in. linda got her soma. thencefor- 
ward she remained in her little room on the thirty-seventh floor of 
bernard's apartment house, in bed, with the radio and television al- 



ways on, and the patchouli tap just dripping, and the soma tablets 
within reach of her hand-there she remained; and yet wasn't there at 
all, was all the time away, infinitely far away, on holiday; on holiday in 
some other world, where the music of the radio was a labyrinth of so- 
norous colours, a sliding, palpitating labyrin

"twelve hundred and fifty kilometres an hour," said the station master 
impressively. "what do you think of that, mr. savage?" 

john thought it very nice. "still," he said, "ariel could put a girdle 
round the earth in forty minutes." 

"the savage," wrote bernard in his report to mustapha mond, "shows 
surprisingly little astonishment at, or awe of, civilized inventions. this 
is partly due, no doubt, to the fact that he has heard them talked 
about by the woman linda, his m ." 

(mustapha mond frowned. "does the fool think i'm too squeamish to 
see the word written out at full length?") 

"partly on his interest being focussed on what he calls 'the soul,' which 
he persists in regarding as an entity independent of the physical envi- 
ronment, whereas, as i tried to point out to him ..." 

the controller skipped the next sentences and was just about to turn 
the page in search of something more interestingly concrete, when his 
eye was caught by a series of

but the savage had suddenly broken away from his companions and 
was violently retching, behind a clump of laurels, as though the solid 
earth had been a helicopter in an air pocket. 

"the savage," wrote bernard, "refuses to take soma, and seems much 
distressed because of the woman linda, his m , remains perma- 
nently on holiday. it is worthy of note that, in spite of his m 's senil- 
ity and the extreme repulsiveness of her appearance, the savage fre- 
quently goes to see her and appears to be much attached to her-an 
interesting example of the way in which early conditioning can be 
made to modify and even run counter to natural impulses (in this case, 
the impulse to recoil from an unpleasant object)."

gaily-coloured aerial hearses rose whirring from the roof and darted 
away across the park, westwards, bound for the slough crematorium. 
at the lift gates the presiding porter gave him the information he re- 
quired, and he dropped down to ward 81 (a galloping senility ward, 
the porter explained) on the seventeenth floor. 

it was a large room bright with sunshine and yellow paint, and con- 
taining twenty beds, all occupied. linda was dying in company-in 
company and with all the modern conveniences. the air was continu- 
ously alive with gay synthetic melodies. at the foot of every bed, con- 
fronting its moribund occupant, was a television box. television was 
left on, a running tap, from morning till night. every quarter of an hour 
the prevailing perfume of the room was automatically changed. "we 
try," explained the nurse, who had taken charge of the savage at the 
door, "we try to create a thoroughly pleasant atmos

horrified eyes; then quickly 
looked away. from throat to temple she was all one hot blush. 

"take me to her," said the savage, making an effort to speak in an or- 
dinary tone. 

still blushing, she led the way down the ward. faces still fresh and un- 
withered (for senility galloped so hard that it had no time to age the 
cheeks-only the heart and brain) turned as they passed. their pro- 
gress was followed by the blank, incurious eyes of second infancy. the 
savage shuddered as he looked. 

linda was lying in the last of the long row of beds, next to the wall. 
propped up on pillows, she was watching the semi-finals of the south 
american riemann-surface tennis championship, which were being 
played in silent and diminished reproduction on the screen of the tele- 
vision box at the foot of the bed. hither and thither across their square 
of illuminated glass the little figures noiselessly darted, like fish in an 
aquarium-the silent but agitated inhabitants of another world.

off any minute now. well, make yourself comfortable." she walked 
briskly away. 

the savage sat down beside the bed. 

"linda," he whispered, taking her hand. 

at the sound of her name, she turned. her vague eyes brightened with 
recognition. she squeezed his hand, she smiled, her lips moved; then 
quite suddenly her head fell forward. she was asleep. he sat watching 
her-seeking through the tired flesh, seeking and finding that young, 
bright face which had stooped over his childhood in malpais, remem- 
bering (and he closed his eyes) her voice, her movements, all the 
events of their life together. "streptocock-gee

their faces, their repeated face-for there was only one between the lot 



of them-puggishly stared, all nostrils and pale goggling eyes. their 
uniform was khaki. all their mouths hung open. squealing and chatter- 
ing they entered. in a moment, it seemed, the ward was maggoty with 
them. they swarmed between the beds, clambered over, crawled un- 
der, peeped into the television boxes, made faces at the patients. 
linda astonished and rather alarmed them. a group stood clustered at 
the foot of her bed, staring with the frightened and stupid curiosity of 
animals suddenly confronted by the unknown. 
"oh, look, look!" they spoke in low, scared voices. "whatever is the 
matter with her? why is she so fat?" 

they had never seen a face like hers before-had never seen a face 
that was not youthful and taut-skinned, a body that had ceased to be 
slim and upright. all these moribund sexagenarians had the appear-

ce of childish girls. at forty-four, linda seemed, by contrast, a mon- 
ster of flaccid and distorted senility. 

"isn't she awful?" came the whispered comments. "look at her teeth!" 
suddenly from under the bed a pug-faced twin popped up between 
john's chair and the wall, and began peering into linda's sleeping face. 
"i say ..." he began; but the sentence ended prematurely in a squeal. 
the savage had seized him by the collar, lifted him clear over the chair 
and, with a smart box on the ears, sent him howling away. 
his yells brought the head nurse hurrying to the rescue. 
"what have you been doing to him?" she demanded fiercely. "i won't 
have you striking the children." 

"well then, keep them away from this bed." the savage's voice was 
trembling with indignation. "what are these filth

"i've warned you," said the nurse, "i've warned you," said the nurse, 
"so mind." still, she led the too inquisitive twins away and made them 
join in the game of hunt-the-zipper, which had been organized by one 
of her colleagues at the other end of the room. 



"run along now and have your cup of caffeine solution, dear," she said 
to the other nurse. the exercise of authority restored her confidence, 
made her feel better. "now children!" she called. 
linda had stirred uneasily, had opened her eyes for a moment, looked 
vaguely around, and then once more dropped off to sleep. sitting be- 
side her, the savage tried hard to recapture his mood of a few minutes 
before. "a, b, c, vitamin d," he repeated to himself, as though the 
words were a spell that would restore the dead past to life. but the 
spell was ineffective. obstinately the beautiful memories refused to 
rise; there was only a hateful resurrection of jealousies and uglinesses

strenuous denial of these memories. "a, b, c, vitamin d ..." he tried to

about him and sang, over and over again, rocking him, rocking him to 
sleep. "a, b, c, vitamin d, vitamin d, vitamin d ..."

risen to a sobbing crescendo; and 
suddenly the verbena gave place, in the scent-circulating system, to 
an intense patchouli. linda stirred, woke up, stared for a few seconds 
bewilderly at the semi-finalists, then, lifting her face, sniffed once or 
twice at the newly perfumed air and suddenly smiled-a smile of child- 
ish ecstasy. 

"pope!" she murmured, and closed her eyes. "oh, i do so like it, i do 
..." she sighed and let herself sink back into the pillows. 
"but, linda!" the savage spoke imploringly, "don't you know me?" he 
had tried so hard, had done his very best; why wouldn't she allow him 
to forget? he squeezed her limp hand almost with violence, as though 
he would force her to come back from this dream of ignoble pleasures, 
from these base and hateful memories-back into the present, back 
into reality: the appalling present, the awful reality-but sublime, but 
significant, but desperately important precisely because of the immi- 
nence of that which

anger suddenly boiled up in him. balked for the second time, the pas-

 suddenly died into an almost inaudible 
breathless croaking. her mouth fell open: she made a desperate effort 
to fill her lungs with air. but it was as though she had forgotten how to 
breathe. she tried to cry out-but no sound came; only the terror of 
her staring eyes revealed what she was suffering. her hands went to 
her throat, then clawed at the air-the air she could no longer breathe, 
the air that, for her, had ceased to exist. 

the savage was on his feet, bent over her. "what is it, linda? what is 
it?" his voice was imploring; it was as though he were begging to be 
reassured. 

the look she gave him was charged with an unspeakable terror-with 
terror and, it seemed to him, reproach. 

she tried to raise herself in bed, but fell back on to the pillows. her 
face was horribly distorted, her lips blue. 
the savage turned and ran up the ward. 
"quick, quick!" he shouted. "quick!"

most instantly to disapproval. "don't shout! think of the little ones," 
she said, frowning. "you might decondition ... but what are you doing?" 
he had broken through the ring. "be careful!" a child was yelling. 
"quick, quick!" he caught her by the sleeve, dragged her after him. 
"quick! something's happened. i've killed her." 
by the time they were back at the end of the ward linda was dead. 



the savage stood for a moment in frozen silence, then fell on his 
knees beside the bed and, covering his face with his hands, sobbed 
uncontrollably. 

the nurse stood irresolute, looking now at the kneeling figure by the 
bed (the scandalous exhibition!) and now (poor children!) at the twins 
who had stopped their hunting of the zipper and were staring from the 
other end of the ward, staring with all their eyes and nostrils at the 
shocking scene that was being enacted round be

turned angrily towards him. their words and, in his ribs, the sharp 
nudging of elbows, broke through his unawareness. he woke once

halted and, with bewildered and horrified eyes, stared round him at 
the khaki mob, in the midst of which, overtopping it by a full head, he 
stood. "how many goodly creatures are there here!" the singing words 
mocked him derisively. "how beauteous mankind is! o brave new 
world ..." 

"soma distribution!" shouted a loud voice. "in good order, please. 
hurry up there."

sforming even the nightmare into something fine and noble. "o

"no shoving there now!" shouted the deputy sub-bursar in a fury. he 
slammed down he lid of his cash-box. "i shall stop the distribution un- 
less i have good behaviour." 

the deltas muttered, jostled one another a little, and then were still. 
the threat had been effective. deprivation of soma-appalling thought! 

"that's better," said the young man, and reopened his cash-box. 

linda had been a slave, linda had died; others should live in freedom, 
and the world be made beautiful. a reparation, a duty. and suddenly it 
was luminously clear to the savage what he must do; it was as though 
a shutter had been opened, a curtain drawn back. 

"now," said the deputy sub-bursar. 

another khaki female stepped forward. 

"stop!" called the savage in a loud and ringing voice. "stop!" 

he pushed his way to the table; the deltas stared at him with aston- 
ishment.

the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow

"i suppose not," said the savage after a silence. "but need it be quite 
so bad as those twins?" he passed his hand over his eyes as though he 
were trying to wipe away the remembered image of those long rows of 
identical midgets at the assembling tables, those queued-up twin- 
herds at the entrance to the brentford monorail station, those human 
maggots swarming round linda's bed of death, the endlessly repeated 
face of his assailants. he looked at his bandaged left hand and shud- 
dered. "horrible!" 

"but how useful! i see you don't like our bokanovsky groups; but, i 
assure you, they're the foundation on which everything else is built. 
they're the gyroscope that stabilizes the rocket plane of state on its 
unswerving course." the deep voice thrillingly vibrated; the gesticulat- 
ing hand implied all space and the onrush of the irresistible machine.

besides, 
we have our stability to think of. we don't want to change. every 
change is a menace to stability. that's another reason why we're so 
chary of applying new inventions. every discovery in pure science is 
potentially subversive; even science must sometimes be treated as a 
possible enemy. yes, even science." 

science? the savage frowned. he knew the word. but what it exactly 
signified he could not say. shakespeare and the old men of the pueblo 
had never mentioned science, and from linda he had only gathered 
the vaguest hints: science was something you made helicopters with, 
some thing that caused you to laugh at the corn dances, something 
that prevented you from being wrinkled and losing your teeth. he 
made a desperate effort to take the controller's meaning. 

"yes," mustapha mond was saying, "that's another item in the cost of 
stability. it isn't only art that's incompatible with happiness; it's also 
science. science is dangerous; we have to keep it most carefully

and by opposing end them ... but you don't do either. neither suffer 
nor oppose. you just abolish the slings and arrows. it's too easy." 
he was suddenly silent, thinking of his mother. in her room on the 
thirty-seventh floor, linda had floated in a sea of singing lights and 
perfumed caresses-floated away, out of space, out of time, out of the 
prison of her memories, her habits, her aged and bloated body. and 
tomakin, ex-director of hatcheries and conditioning, tomakin was still 
on holiday-on holiday from humiliation and pain, in a world where he 
could not hear those words, that derisive laughter, could not see that 
hideous face, feel those moist and flabby arms round his neck, in a 
beautiful world ...

was not to sing and enjoy himself that he had come here. it was to es-

rified and made good; it was actively to make amends. he realized to 
his dismay that, absorbed in the whittling of his bow, he had forgotten 
what he had sworn to himself he would constantly remember-poor 
linda, and his own murderous unkindness to her, and those loathsome 
twins, swarming like lice across the mystery of her death, insulting, 
with their presence, not merely his own grief and repentance, but the 
very gods themselves. he had sworn to remember, he had sworn un- 
ceasingly to make amends. and there was he, sitting happily over his 
bow-stave, singing, actually singing. ...

not the smooth body of his desires, but an armful of green spikes. 
sharp, with a thousand points, they pricked him. he tried to think of 
poor linda, breathless and dumb, with her clutching hands and the 
unutterable terror in her eyes. poor linda whom he had sworn to re- 
member. but it was still the presence of lenina that haunted him. len-

of the juniper needles, his wincing flesh was aware of her, unescapably 
real. "sweet, sweet ... and if you wanted me too, why didn't you ..."

white, warm, scented, infamous lenina that he was dogging thus.
