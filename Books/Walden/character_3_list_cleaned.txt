[CHARACTER] - 
                 a
poor irish-american laborer who lives with his wife and children
on the baker farm just outside of concord. thoreau uses field as
an example of an "honest, hard-working, but shiftless man," someone who
is forced to struggle at a great disadvantage in life because he
lacks unusual natural abilities or social position. the conversation
that thoreau and field have when thoreau runs to the field home
for shelter in a rainstorm is an uncomfortable reminder that thoreau's
ideas and convictions may set him apart from those same poor people
that he elsewhere idealizes. rather than converse casually with
field, thoreau gives him a heated lecture on the merits of cutting
down on coffee and meat consumption. overall, his treatment of field
seems condescending. his parting regret that field suffers from
an "inherited" irish proclivity to laziness casts a strangely ungenerous,
even slightly racist light over all of thoreau's ideas.
