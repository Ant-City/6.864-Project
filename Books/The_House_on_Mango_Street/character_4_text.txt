his other cousin 

downstairs from meme's is a basement apartment that 
meme's  mother  fixed  up  and  rented  to  a  puerto  rican 
family.  louie's  family.  louie  is  the  oldest  in  a  family  of 
little  sisters.  he is  my  brother's friend  really,  but i  know 
he has two cousins and that his t-shirts never stay tucked 
in his  pants. 

louie's  girl  cousin  is  older  than  us.  she  lives  with 
louie's  family  because  her own  family  is  in  puerto rico. 
her name is  marin  or maris  or something like  that,  and 
she wears dark nylons all the time and lots of makeup she 
gets  free  from  selling  avon.  she  can't  come  out-gotta 
baby-sit with louie's sisters-but she stands in the doorway

a lamppost. 

marin screamed and we ran down the block to where 
the cop car's siren spun a dizzy blue. the nose of that yellow

louie has another cousin.  we only saw  him once, but 
it was  important.  we  were  playing  volleyball  in  the alley 
when  he  drove  up  in  this  great  big  yellow  cadillac  with 
whitewalls  and  a  yellow  scarf  tied  around  the  mirror. 
louie's cousin had his arm out the window.  he honked a 
couple of times and a lot of faces  looked out from louie's 
back  window  and  then  a  lot of people came out-louie, 
marin and all  the little sisters. 

everybody looked inside the car and asked where he 
got it.  there were white  rugs and white leather seats.  we 
all asked for a ride and asked where he got it. louie's cousin 
said  get in. 

we each had to sit with one of louie's little sisters on 
our lap, but that was okay. the seats were big and soft like 
a sofa,  and there was  a little white cat in the back window 
whose  eyes  lit  up  when  the  car stopped  or  turned.  the 
windows didn't roll  up lik

stopped the car right where we  were and said, everybody 
out of the  car.  then he  took off flooring  that car into  a 
yellow blur. we hardly had time to think when the cop car 
pulled  in  the  alley  going just as  fast.  we  saw  the  yellow 
cadillac at the end of the block trying to make a left-hand

back  to  her  mother  with  a  letter  saying  she's  too  much 
trouble,  and  that  is  too  bad  because  i  like  marin.  she  is 
older and knows lots of things. she is  the one who told us 
how  davey  the baby's sister got pregnant and what cream 
is  best for  taking off moustache hair and if you count the 
white  flecks  on your  fingernails  you  can  know  how  many 
boys  are  thinking  of you  and  lots  of other  things  i  can't 
remember now. 

we never see  marin until her aunt comes home from 
work, and even then she can only stay out in front. she is 
there  every  night  with  the  radio.  when

the  light  in  her 
aunt's room goes out, marin lights a cigarette and it doesn't 
matter if it's cold out or if the tadio doesn't work or if we've 
got nothing to say to each other. what matters, marin says, 
is  for the boys  to see us and for us  to see  them. and since 
marin's  skirts  are  shorte'  and  since  her  eyes  are  pretty, 
and since marin is already older than us in many ways,  the 
boys who do pass by say stupid things like i am in love with 
those two green apples you call eyes, give  them to me why 
don't you. and marin just looks at them without even blink­
ing and is  not afraid. 

marin,  under  the  streetlight,  dancing  by  herself,  is 
singing  the same song somewhere.  i  know.  is  waiting  for 
a car to stop, a  star to fall,  someone to change  her life.

getting  married  when  she  goes  back  to  p.r.  she  says  he 
didn't  get  a job yet,  but she's  saving  the  money  she  gets 
from  selling avon and  taking care of her cousins. 

marin says that if she stays here next year, she's going 
to  get  a  real job downtown  because  that's  where  the  best 
jobs are,  since  you  always  get to look  beautiful and get to 
wear nice clothes and can meet someone in the subway who 
might  marry  you  and  take  you  to  live  in  a  big  house  far 
away.

no last name 

she met him at a  dance.  pretty too, and young. said 
he worked in a  restaurant, but she can't remember which 
one. geraldo.  that's all.  green  pants and saturday shirt. 
geraldo. that's what he told  her. 

and how was she to know she'd be the last one to see 
him alive. an accident, don't you know. hit-and-run. marin, 
she  goes  to  all  those  dances.  uptown.  logan.  embassy. 
palmer. aragon. fontana. the manor. she likes to dance. 
she  knows  how  to  do  cumbias  and  salsas  and  rancheras 
even. and he wasjust someone she danced with. somebody 
she met that night. that's right. 

that's the story. that's what she said again and again.
