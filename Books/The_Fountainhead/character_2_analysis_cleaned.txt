[CHARACTER]
dominique's beauty and strength of spirit make her a perverse, unusual
woman and the perfect complement to howard roark. at the beginning
of the novel, she is convinced of the world's rottenness and believes
that greatness has no chance of survival. she surrounds herself
with the things she despises to avoid watching the world destroy
the things she loves. dominique instantly recognizes roark's greatness,
but she does not initially believe that he can survive in a selfless
and irrational society. the thought that a man like roark needs
society in order to build pains dominique, and she tries to destroy
him before the rest of the world can. yet dominique wants to fail
in her bid to destroy roark, because if she fails it means absolute
good and genius can survive even in an evil world.
