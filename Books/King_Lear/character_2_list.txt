Goneril - 
                Lear's
ruthless oldest daughter and the wife of the duke of Albany. Goneril
is jealous, treacherous, and amoral. Shakespeare's audience would
have been particularly shocked at Goneril's aggressiveness, a quality
that it would not have expected in a female character. She challenges
Lear's authority, boldly initiates an affair with Edmund, and wrests
military power away from her husband.
