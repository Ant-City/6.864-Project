 a  green
plastic  poncho  that  could  be  used  as  a  raincoat  or  groundsheet  or
makeshift  tent.  with  its  quilted  liner,  the  poncho  weighed  almost  2
pounds,  but  it  was  worth  every  ounce.  in  april,  for  instance,  when  ted
lavender was shot, they used his poncho to wrap him up, then to carry
him  across  the  paddy,  then  to  lift  him  into  the  chopper  that  took  him
away.





they were called legs or grunts.
to carry something was to hump it, as when lieutenant jimmy cross
humped his love for martha up the hills and through the swamps. in its
intransitive  form,  to  hump  meant  to  walk,  or  to  march,  but  it  implied
burdens far beyond the intransitive.

almost everyone humped photographs. in his wallet, lieutenant cross
carried two photographs of martha. the first was a kodacolor snapshot
signed love, though he knew better. she stood against a brick wall. her
eyes were gray and neutral, her lips slightly open as she stared straight-
on at the camera. at ni

ed the war, except
to say, jimmy, take care of yourself. she wasn't involved. she signed the
letters love, but it wasn't love, and all the fine lines and technicalities did
not matter. virginity was no longer an issue. he hated her. yes, he did.
he hated her. love, too, but it was a hard, hating kind of love.

the  morning  came  up  wet  and  blurry.  everything  seemed  part  of

everything else, the fog and martha and the deepening rain.

he was a soldier, after all.
half smiling, lieutenant jimmy cross took out his maps. he shook his
head  hard,  as  if  to  clear  it,  then  bent  forward  and  began  planning  the
day's march. in ten minutes, or maybe twenty, he would rouse the men
and  they  would  pack  up  and  head  west,  where  the  maps  showed  the
country  to  be  green  and  inviting.  they  would  do  what  they  had  always
done.  the  rain  might  add  some  weight,  but  otherwise  it  would  be  one
more day layered upon all the other days.

n. commencing immediately, he'd tell them, they
would  no  longer  abandon  equipment  along  the  route  of  march.  they
would police up their acts. they would get their shit together, and keep it
together, and maintain it neatly and in good working order.

he  would  not  tolerate  laxity.  he  would  show  strength,  distancing

himself.

among  the  men  there  would  be  grumbling,  of  course,  and  maybe
worse, because their days would seem longer and their loads heavier, but
lieutenant jimmy cross reminded himself that his obligation was not to



be  loved  but  to  lead.  he  would  dispense  with  love;  it  was  not  now  a
factor. and if anyone quarreled or complained, he would simply tighten
his  lips  and  arrange  his  shoulders  in  the  correct  command  posture.  he
might  give  a  curt  little  nod.  or  he  might  not.  he  might  just  shrug  and
say,  carry  on,  then  they  would  saddle  up  and  form  into  a  column  and
move out toward the villages west of than khe.

many years after the war jimmy cross came to visit me at my home in
massachusetts, and for a full day we drank coffee and smoked cigarettes
and  talked  about  everything  we  had  seen  and  done  so  long  ago,  all  the
things  we  still  carried  through  our  lives.  spread  out  across  the  kitchen
table were maybe a hundred old photographs. there were pictures of rat
kiley and kiowa and mitchell sanders, all of us, the faces incredibly soft
and young. at one point, i remember, we paused over a snapshot of ted
lavender, and

gin,  which  improved  the  mood,  and  not  much  later  we  were  laughing
about some of the craziness that used to go on. the way henry dobbins

kiowa's  moccasins  and  hunting  hatchet.  rat  kiley's  comic  books.  by
midnight we were both a little high, and i decided there was no harm in
asking  about  martha.  i'm  not  sure  how  i  phrased  it—just  a  general
question—but jimmy cross looked up in surprise. "you writer types," he
said,  "you've  got  long  memories."  then  he  smiled  and  excused  himself
and  went  up  to  the  guest  room  and  came  back  with  a  small  framed
photograph.  it  was  the  volleyball  shot:  martha  bent  horizontal  to  the
floor, reaching, the palms of her hands in sharp focus.

"remember this?" he said.
i nodded and told him i was surprised. i thought he'd burned it.
jimmy kept smiling. for a while he stared down at the photograph, his

then  he  would  have  told  about  the  night  they  bivouacked  in  a  field
along the song tra bong. a big swampy field beside the river. there was
a  ville  nearby,  fifty  meters  downstream,  and  right  away  a  dozen  old
mama-sans ran out and started yelling. a weird scene, he would've said.
the mama-sans just stood there in the rain, soaking wet, yapping away
about how this field was bad news. number ten, they said. evil ground.
not a good spot for good gis. finally lieutenant jimmy cross had to get
out his pistol and fire off a few rounds just to shoo them away. by then it
was  almost  dark.  so  they  set  up  a  perimeter,  ate  chow,  then  crawled
under their ponchos and tried to settle in for the night.

but the rain kept getting worse. and by midnight the field turned into

soup.

"just  this  deep,  oozy  soup,"  he  would've  said.  "like  sewage  or
something.  thick  and  mushy.  you  couldn't  sleep.  you  couldn't  even  lie
down,  not  for  long,  because  you'd  s

gentle  and  quiet-spoken.  very  brave,  too.  and  decent.  the  kid's  father
taught sunday school in oklahoma city, where kiowa had been raised to
believe  in  the  promise  of  salvation  under  jesus  christ,  and  this
conviction  had  always  been  present  in  the  boy's  smile,  in  his  posture
toward  the  world,  in  the  way  he  never  went  anywhere  without  an
illustrated  new  testament  that  his  father  had  mailed  to  him  as  a
birthday present back in january.
a crime, jimmy cross thought.
looking  out  toward  the  river,  he  knew  for  a  fact  that  he  had  made  a
mistake setting up here. the order had come from higher, true, but still
he  should've  exercised  some  field  discretion.  he  should've  moved  to
higher ground for the night, should've radioed in false coordinates. there
was  nothing  he  could  do  now,  but  still  it  was  a  mistake  and  a  hideous
waste. he felt sick about it. standing in the deep waters of the field, first

he harness, and pulled the straps tight. "all right,
but this much for sure. the man knew it was raining. he knew about the
river. one plus one. add it up, you get exactly what happened." sanders
glared  at  the  river.  "move  it,"  he  said.  "kiowa's  waiting  on  us."  slowly
then,  bending  against  the  rain,  azar  and  norman  bowker  and  mitchell
sanders began wading again through the deep waters, their eyes down,
circling out from where they had found the rucksack.


first lieutenant jimmy cross stood fifty meters away. he had finished
writing  the  letter  in  his  head,  explaining  things  to  kiowa's  father,  and
now he folded his arms and watched his platoon crisscrossing the wide
field. in a funny way, it reminded him of the municipal golf course in his
hometown in new jersey. a lost ball, he thought. tired players searching
through the rough, sweeping back and forth in long systematic patterns.
he wished he were there right now. on the sixth hole. looking out across
the  water

 hazard  that  fronted  the  small  flat  green,  a  seven  iron  in  his



hand,  calculating  wind  and  distance,  wondering  if  he  should  reach
instead for an eight. a tough decision, but all you could ever lose was a
ball. you did not lose a player. and you never had to wade out into the
hazard and spend the day searching through the slime.

jimmy cross did not want the responsibility of leading these men. he
had never wanted it. in his sophomore year at mount sebastian college
he  had  signed  up  for  the  reserve  officer  training  corps  without  much
thought. an automatic thing: because his friends had joined, and because
it was worth a few credits, and because it seemed preferable to letting the
draft take him. he was unprepared. twenty-four years old and his heart
wasn't in it. military matters meant nothing to him. he did not care one

up, tasting the field in his mouth, listening to
the  rain  and  explosions  and  bubbling  sounds.  he  was  alone.  he'd  lost
everything.  he'd  lost  kiowa  and  his  weapon  and  his  flashlight  and  his
girlfriend's  picture.  he  remembered  this.  he  remembered  wondering  if
he could lose himself.

now,  in  the  dull  morning  rain,  the  boy  seemed  frantic.  he  waded
quickly from spot to spot, leaning down and plunging his hands into the
water. he did not look up when lieutenant jimmy cross approached.

"right here," the boy was saying. "got to be right here."
jimmy  cross  remembered  the  kid's  face  but  not  the  name.  that
happened  sometimes.  he  tried  to  treat  his  men  as  individuals  but
sometimes the names just escaped him.

he watched the young soldier shove his hands into the water. "right

here," he kept saying. his movements seemed random and jerky.



jimmy cross waited a moment, then stepped closer. "listen," he said

quietly, "the guy could be anywhere."
t

he boy glanced up. "who could?"
"kiowa. you can't expect—"
"kiowa's dead."
"well, yes."
the young soldier nodded. "so what about billie?"
"who?"
"my girl. what about her? this picture, it was the only one i had. right

here, i lost it."

jimmy cross shook his head. it bothered him that he could not come

up with a name.

"slow down," he said, "i don't—"
"billie's picture. i had it all wrapped up, i had it in plastic, so it'll be
okay if i can . . . last night we were looking at it, me and kiowa. right
here. i know for sure it's right here somewhere."

jimmy  cross  smiled  at  the  boy.  "you  can  ask  her  for  another  one.  a

better one."

"she  won't  send  another  one.  she's  not  even  my  girl  anymore,  she

won't. . . man, i

  dipped  into  the
muck  with  both  hands.  his  shoulders  were  shaking.  briefly,  lieutenant
cross  wondered  where  the  kid's  weapon  was,  and  his  helmet,  but  it
seemed better not to ask.

he  felt  some  pity  come  on  him.  for  a  moment  the  day  seemed  to
soften. so much hurt, he thought. he watched the young soldier wading
through  the  water,  bending  down  and  then  standing  and  then  bending
down again, as if something might finally be salvaged from all the waste.

jimmy cross silently wished the boy luck.
then  he  closed  his  eyes  and  went  back  to  working  on  the  letter  to

kiowa's father.




across the field azar and norman bowker and mitchell sanders were
wading alongside a narrow dike at the edge of the field. it was near noon
now.

norman  bowker  found  kiowa.  he  was  under  two  feet  of  water.

nothing showed except the heel of a boot.

"that's him?" azar said.
"who else?"
"i don't know." azar shook his head. "i don't know."

sat holding his stomach. his face was pale.
the  others  stood  in  a  circle,  watching  the  water,  then  after  a  time
somebody said, "we can't just leave him there," and the men nodded and
got  out  their  entrenching  tools  and  began  digging.  it  was  hard,  sloppy



work. the mud seemed to flow back faster than they could dig, but kiowa
was their friend and they kept at it anyway.

slowly,  in  little  groups,  the  rest  of  the  platoon  drifted  over  to  watch.
only lieutenant jimmy cross and the young soldier were still searching
the field.

"what we should do, i guess," norman bowker said, "is tell the lt."
mitchell  sanders  shook  his  head.  "just  mess  things  up.  besides,  the

man looks happy out there, real content. let him be."

after  ten  minutes  they  uncovered  most  of  kiowa's  lower  body.  the
corpse was angled steeply into the muck, upside down, like a diver who
had plunged headfirst off a high tower. the men stood quietly for a few
seconds. there was a fee

the dike next to norman bowker.
"listen," he said. "those dumb jokes—i didn't mean anything."
"we all say things."
"yeah, but when i saw the guy, it made me feel—i don't know—like he

was listening."



"he wasn't."
"i guess not. but i felt sort of guilty almost, like if i'd kept my mouth

shut none of it would've ever happened. like it was my fault."

norman bowker looked out across the wet field.
"nobody's fault," he said. "everybody's."



near the center of the field first lieutenant jimmy cross squatted in
the  muck,  almost  entirely  submerged.  in  his  head  he  was  revising  the
letter  to  kiowa's  father.  impersonal  this  time.  an  officer  expressing  an
officer's condolences. no apologies were necessary, because in fact it was
one  of  those  freak  things,  and  the  war  was  full  of  freaks,  and  nothing
could ever change it anyway. which was the truth, he thought. the exact
truth.

lieutenant  cross  went  deeper  into  the  muck,  the  dark  water  at  his

throat,

he boy wanted to confess. he wanted to tell the lieutenant how in the
middle of the night he had pulled out billie's picture and passed it over to
kiowa  and  then  switched  on  the  flashlight,  and  how  kiowa  had
whispered,  "hey,  she's  cute,"  and  how  for  a  second  the  flashlight  had
made billie's face sparkle, and how right then the field had exploded all
around  them.  the  flashlight  had  done  it.  like  a  target  shining  in  the
dark.

the boy looked up at the sky, then at jimmy cross.
"sir?" he said.
the rain and mist moved across the field in broad, sweeping sheets of

gray. close by, there was thunder.

"sir," the boy said, "i got to explain something."
but  lieutenant  jimmy  cross  wasn't  listening.  eyes  closed,  he  let
himself  go  deeper  into  the  waste,  just  letting  the  field  take  him.  he  lay
back and floated.

when  a  man  died,  there  had  to  be  blame.  jimmy  cross  understood
this. you could blame the war. you could blame the idiots who made the

kathleen gave me a little nod.
"well," she said, "i hope you're having fun."
"sure."
"can we go now?"
"in a minute," i said. "just relax."
at the back of the jeep i found the small cloth bundle i'd carried over

from the states.

kathleen's eyes narrowed. "what's that?"
"stuff," i told her.
she  glanced  at  the  bundle  again,  then  hopped  out  of  the  jeep  and
followed me back to the field. we walked past jimmy cross's command
post, past the spot where kiowa had gone under, down to where the field
dipped into the marshland along the river. i took off my shoes and socks.

"okay," kathleen said, "what's going on?"
"a quick swim."
"where?"
"right here," i said. "stay put."
she  watched  me  unwrap  the  cloth  bundle.  inside  were  kiowa's  old

moccasins.



i stripped down to my underwear, took off my wrist-watch, and waded
in. the water was warm against my feet. instantly, i recognized the soft,
