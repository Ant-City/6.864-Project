 oedipus, great and wise, 
who solved the famous riddle. this is he 1460 

whom all men gazed upon with envious eyes, 
who now is struggling in a stormy sea, 

crushed by the billows of his bitter woes. 
look to the end of mortal life. in vain 

we say a man is happy, till he goes 
beyond life's final border, free from pain.

between what should and what should not be talked of— 970 
you, here in public, heap your insults on me. 
and this, you think, is the proper time to flatter 
the famous theseus and to proclaim how well 
the athenian state is governed. yet in giving 
such lavish praises, you forget that athens 
exxels in reverent worship of the gods; 
for you had planned to abduct me, an old man 
who had sought the gods' protection. you have seized 
my daughters and have tried to seize me also. 
hence, i invoke these goddesses, with prayers 980 

beseeching them to come to my assistance, 
to fight in my defence, that you may learn

if any prayer may be addressed to thee, 

hear us, persephone, 
dread goddess hidden from our mortal sight! 
lord hades, hear, god of the land of night! 

grant that our friend may go, 
not sorrowful, not suffering from his doom, 

down to the dead below, 
down to the stvgian fields' enshrouding gloom. 

from his unmerited misery 1500

senger: 

you may be certain his last day has come. 

chorus: 

what did the gods decree? a painless doom? 

messsenger: 

wonderful things have happened. you all know, 

since you were here yourselves, how oedipus left you 

with no one guiding him, for he himself 1520 

showed us the way. now when he reached the chasm 

where the bronze steps lead down precipitously, 

he paused by one of many branching paths 

by the rock-basin, the memorial 

of the unbroken pact peirithous 

made with king theseus. there he stood midway 

between this basin, the thorician stone, 

the hollow pear-tree, and the marble tomb. 

then he sat down, loosened his sordid garments, 

and summoning his daughters, bade them bring him 1530 

water from some pure spring, that he might wash 

and pour out a drink-offering to the dead. 

so from demeter's hillside, close at hand, 

quickly they brought all that their father asked for, 

washed him, and clothed him as is customary, 

neglecting nothing that could satisfy

ce echoing and re-echoing, 
standing their hair on end, rang out in summons: 
'oedipus, oedipus, why do we delay? 
ajread) you have lingered here too long.' 
knowing .1 god had called him, oedipus 
asked i heseus to draw near, and .it his coining 
s.iid to him, 'dearest friend, here arc- my daughters. 
givel hem your hand— and children, give him yours— 1560 

promise me always to be kind to them, 
always to do vi hat you think best for them.' 
checking his grief, high-minded as he is, 
king theseus made this promise. thereupon, 
oedipus, groping blindly for his daughters, 
said to them, 'children, courage! you must go. 
do not ask to see or hear forbidden things. 
leave this place quickly, but let the king remain, 
whose right it is to witness what will happen.' 
1 baring him speak these words, we turned away 1570 

with the two women, weeping bitterly. 
and then, a little later, we looked back. 
there was no sign of oedipus to be seen, 
and theseus stood with his hand before his face,

hielding his eyes, like one who beheld some sight 
so awful as to be unendurable. 
then he began to pray, bowing in worship 
of earth and of the heavens. in what manner 
oedipus met his doom no mortal knows 

other than theseus. in that final moment, 1580 

no flash of lightning made an end of him, 
nor sudden tempest springing from the sea. 
either some messenger of the gods arrived, 
or the foundations of the earth split open 
to take him without pain, indulgently. 
his going was not marked by lamentation, 
sickness, or suffering. no one has ever met 
an end so marvelous. if anyone here 
feels that such things are unbelievable, 

i will not try to persuade him of their truth. 1590

where are the women now

theseus: 

my daughters, weep no more. the gods of hades 
have shown their great beneficence to us all, 
the living and the dead. further lament 
would bring their anger down upon our heads.

hear, son of aegeus! hear our supplication! 

theseus: 

what would you ask of me, antigone? 

antigone: 

that we ourselves might see our father's grave. 

theseus: 

i cannot let you, child. it is forbidden. 

antigone: 

how can that be, o king, o lord of athens?

daughters, your father laid this charge upon me: 
no one was to draw near his resting place,

these things i promised him, and the great gods
