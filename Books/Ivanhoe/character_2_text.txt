 repelling the advances of his four-legged
dependants. one grisly old wolf-dog alone, with the liberty of an
indulged favourite, had planted himself close by the chair of state, and
occasionally ventured to solicit notice by putting his large hairy head
upon his master’s knee, or pushing his nose into his hand. even he was
repelled by the stern command, “down, balder, down! i am not in the
humour for foolery.”

in fact, cedric, as we have observed, was in no very placid state of
mind. the lady rowena, who had been absent to attend an evening mass at
a distant church, had but just returned, and was changing her garments,
which had been wetted by the storm. there were as yet no tidings of
gurth and his charge, which should long since have been driven home from
the forest and such was the insecurity of the period, as to render it
probable that the delay might be explained by some depreciation of the
outlaws, with whom the adjacent forest abounded, or by the violence
of some neighbouring baron,

and wine with which he was in the habit of accompanying
it. add to all this, cedric had fasted since noon, and his usual supper
hour was long past, a cause of irritation common to country squires,
both in ancient and modern times. his displeasure was expressed in
broken sentences, partly muttered to himself, partly addressed to the
domestics who stood around; and particularly to his cupbearer, who
offered him from time to time, as a sedative, a silver goblet filled
with wine--“why tarries the lady rowena?”

“she is but changing her head-gear,” replied a female attendant, with as
much confidence as the favourite lady’s-maid usually answers the master
of a modern family; “you would not wish her to sit down to the banquet
in her hood and kirtle? and no lady within the shire can be quicker in
arraying herself than my mistress.”

this undeniable argument produced a sort of acquiescent umph! on the
part of the saxon, with the addition, “i wish her devotion may choose

“but it will be her especial pleasure,” answered elgitha, with great
readiness, “for she is ever desirous to hear the latest news from
palestine.”

cedric darted at the forward damsel a glance of hasty resentment; but
rowena, and whatever belonged to her, were privileged and secure from
his anger. he only replied, “silence, maiden; thy tongue outruns thy

around her face, as an intimation that the determined freedom of his
glance was disagreeable. cedric saw the motion and its cause. “sir

of the sun to enable them to bear the fixed glance of a crusader.”

“if i have offended,” replied sir brian, “i crave your pardon,--that
is, i crave the lady rowena’s pardon,--for my humility will carry me no

“the lady rowena,” said the prior, “has punished us all, in chastising
the boldness of my friend. let me hope she will be less cruel to the
splendid train which are to meet at the tournament.”

“our going thither,” said cedric, “is uncertain. i love not these
vanities, which were unknown to my fathers when england was free.”

“let us hope, nevertheless,” said the prior, “our company may determine

trembling hands over the fire, would have formed no bad emblematical
personification of the winter season. having dispelled the cold, he
turned eagerly to the smoking mess which was placed before him, and
ate with a haste and an apparent relish, that seemed to betoken long
abstinence from food.

meanwhile the abbot and cedric continued their discourse upon hunting;
the lady rowena seemed engaged in conversation with one of her attendant
females; and the haughty templar, whose eye wandered from the jew to
the saxon beauty, revolved in his mind thoughts which appeared deeply to
interest him.

“i marvel, worthy cedric,” said the abbot, as their discourse proceeded,

he might have staid at home with his merry englishmen, and left the
recovery of jerusalem to those same knights who had most to do with the
loss of it.”

“were there, then, none in the english army,” said the lady rowena,
“whose names are worthy to be mentioned with the knights of the temple,
and of st john?”

“forgive me, lady,” replied de bois-guilbert; “the english monarch did,
indeed, bring to palestine a host of gallant warriors, second only to
those whose breasts have been the unceasing bulwark of that blessed
land.”

“second to none,” said the pilgrim, who had stood near enough to hear,

knight the meeting he desires.”

e crossed himself again and again, and after
many genuflections and muttered prayers, he delivered the reliquary to
brother ambrose, his attendant monk, while he himself swept up with less
ceremony, but perhaps with no less internal satisfaction, the golden
chain, and bestowed it in a pouch lined with perfumed leather, which
opened under his arm. “and now, sir cedric,” he said, “my ears are
chiming vespers with the strength of your good wine--permit us another
pledge to the welfare of the lady rowena, and indulge us with liberty to
pass to our repose.”

“by the rood of bromholme,” said the saxon, “you do but small credit to
your fame, sir prior! report speaks you a bonny monk, that would hear
the matin chime ere he quitted his bowl; and, old as i am, i feared to
have shame in encountering you. but, by my faith, a saxon boy of twelve,
in my time, would not so soon have relinquished his goblet.”

already given so many proofs, might at length produce some disagreeable
explosion. he therefore gently insinuated the incapacity of the native
of any other country to engage in the genial conflict of the bowl
with the hardy and strong-headed saxons; something he mentioned, but
slightly, about his own holy character, and ended by pressing his
proposal to depart to repose.

the grace-cup was accordingly served round, and the guests, after making
deep obeisance to their landlord and to the lady rowena, arose and
mingled in the hall, while the heads of the family, by separate doors,
retired with their attendants.

“unbelieving dog,” said the templar to isaac the jew, as he passed him
in the throng, “dost thou bend thy course to the tournament?”

“i do so propose,” replied isaac, bowing in all humility, “if it please
your reverend valour.”

t. yet let not modern beauty envy the
magnificence of a saxon princess. the walls of the apartment were so ill
finished and so full of crevices, that the rich hangings shook in the
night blast, and, in despite of a sort of screen intended to protect
them from the wind, the flame of the torches streamed sideways into the
air, like the unfurled pennon of a chieftain. magnificence there was,
with some rude attempt at taste; but of comfort there was little, and,
being unknown, it was unmissed.

the lady rowena, with three of her attendants standing at her back, and
arranging her hair ere she lay down to rest, was seated in the sort of
throne already mentioned, and looked as if born to exact general homage.
the pilgrim acknowledged her claim to it by a low genuflection.

“rise, palmer,” said she graciously. “the defender of the absent has
a right to favourable reception from all who value truth, and honour
manhood.” she then said to her train, “retire, excepting only elgitha; i

persecution of the french faction, to whom the templars are known to be
attached.”

“i know little of the knight of ivanhoe,” answered the palmer, with
a troubled voice. “i would i knew him better, since you, lady, are
interested in his fate. he hath, i believe, surmounted the persecution
of his enemies in palestine, and is on the eve of returning to england,
where you, lady, must know better than i, what is his chance of
happiness.”

the lady rowena sighed deeply, and asked more particularly when the
knight of ivanhoe might be expected in his native country, and whether
he would not be exposed to great dangers by the road. on the first
point, the palmer professed ignorance; on the second, he said that the
voyage might be safely made by the way of venice and genoa, and from
thence through france to england. “ivanhoe,” he said, “was so well
acquainted with the language and manners of the french, that there was
no fear of his incurring

“would to god,” said the lady rowena, “he were here safely arrived, and

it must be owned, that if an interest displayed in his success could
have bribed the disinherited knight, the part of the lists before which
he paused had merited his predilection. cedric the saxon, overjoyed at
the discomfiture of the templar, and still more so at the miscarriage of
his two malevolent neighbours, front-de-boeuf and malvoisin, had, with
his body half stretched over the balcony, accompanied the victor in each
course, not with his eyes only, but with his whole heart and soul. the
lady rowena had watched the progress of the day with equal attention,
though without openly betraying the same intense interest. even the
unmoved athelstane had shown symptoms of shaking off his apathy, when,
calling for a huge goblet of muscadine, he quaffed it to the health
of the disinherited knight. another group, stationed under the gallery
occupied by the saxons, had shown no less interest in the fate of the
day.

“father abraham!” said isaac of york, when the first course was run

whether from indecision, or some other motive of hesitation, the
champion of the day remained stationary for more than a minute, while
the eyes of the silent audience were riveted upon his motions; and then,
gradually and gracefully sinking the point of his lance, he deposited
the coronet which it supported at the feet of the fair rowena. the
trumpets instantly sounded, while the heralds proclaimed the lady rowena
the queen of beauty and of love for the ensuing day, menacing with
suitable penalties those who should be disobedient to her authority.
they then repeated their cry of largesse, to which cedric, in the height
of his joy, replied by an ample donative, and to which athelstane,
though less promptly, added one equally large.

there was some murmuring among the damsels of norman descent, who were
as much unused to see the preference given to a saxon beauty, as the
norman nobles were to sustain defea

t in the games of chivalry which they
themselves had introduced. but these sounds of disaffection were drowned
by the popular shout of “long live the lady rowena, the chosen and
lawful queen of love and of beauty!” to which many in the lower area
added, “long live the saxon princess! long live the race of the immortal
alfred!”

however unacceptable these sounds might be to prince john, and to
those around him, he saw himself nevertheless obliged to confirm the
nomination of the victor, and accordingly calling to horse, he left
his throne; and mounting his jennet, accompanied by his train, he again
entered the lists. the prince paused a moment bene

rowena was seated, with the crown still at her feet.

“assume,” he said, “fair lady, the mark of your sovereignty, to which
none vows homage more sincerely than ourself, john of anjou; and if
it please you to-day, with your noble sire and friends, to grace our
banquet in the castle of ashby, we shall learn to know the empress to
whose service we devote to-morrow.”

rowena remained silent, and cedric answered for her in his native saxon.

“the lady rowena,” he said, “possesses not the language in which to
reply to your courtesy, or to sustain her part in your festival. i also,
and the noble athelstane of coningsburgh, speak only the language, and
practise only the manners, of our fathers. we therefore decline with
thanks your highness’s courteous invitation to the banquet. to-morrow,
the lady rowena will take upon her the state to which she has been
called by the free election of the victor knight, confirmed by the

dmitted, to the disappointment of several who were too late in
preferring their claim to be included.

about the hour of ten o’clock, the whole plain was crowded with
horsemen, horsewomen, and foot-passengers, hastening to the tournament;
and shortly after, a grand flourish of trumpets announced prince john
and his retinue, attended by many of those knights who meant to take
share in the game, as well as others who had no such intention.

about the same time arrived cedric the saxon, with the lady rowena,
unattended, however, by athelstane. this saxon lord had arrayed his
tall and strong person in armour, in order to take his place among the
combatants; and, considerably to the surprise of cedric, had chosen to
enlist himself on the part of the knight templar. the saxon, indeed, had
remonstrated strongly with his friend upon the injudicious choice he had
made of his party; but he had only received that sort of answer usually
given by those who are more obstinate in following their own course,

han strong in justifying it.

his best, if not his only reason, for adhering to the party of brian de
bois-guilbert, athelstane had the prudence to keep to himself. though
his apathy of disposition prevented his taking any means to recommend
himself to the lady rowena, he was, nevertheless, by no means insensible
to her charms, and considered his union with her as a matter already
fixed beyond doubt, by the assent of cedric and her other friends. it
had therefore been with smothered displeasure that the proud though
indolent lord of coningsburgh beheld the victor of the preceding day
select rowena as the object of that honour which it became his privilege
to confer. in order to punish him for a preference which seemed to
interfere with his own suit, athelsta

honour which your valour has justly deserved.” the knight bowed low and
gracefully, but returned no answer.

while the trumpets sounded, while the heralds strained their voices in
proclaiming honour to the brave and glory to the victor--while ladies
waved their silken kerchiefs and embroidered veils, and while all ranks
joined in a clamorous shout of exultation, the marshals conducted the
disinherited knight across the lists to the foot of that throne of
honour which was occupied by the lady rowena.

on the lower step of this throne the champion was made to kneel down.
indeed his whole action since the fight had ended, seemed rather to have
been upon the impulse of those around him than from his own free will;
and it was observed that he tottered as they guided him the second time
across the lists. rowena, descending from her station with a graceful
and dignified step, was about to place the chaplet which she held in her
hand upon the helmet of the champion, when the marshals exclaimed wi

physician shall attend him.”

a stern smile curled the prince’s lip as he spoke. waldemar fitzurse
hastened to reply, that ivanhoe was already removed from the lists, and
in the custody of his friends.

“i was somewhat afflicted,” he said, “to see the grief of the queen of
love and beauty, whose sovereignty of a day this event has changed into
mourning. i am not a man to be moved by a woman’s lament for her lover,
but this same lady rowena suppressed her sorrow with such dignity of
manner, that it could only be discovered by her folded hands, and her
tearless eye, which trembled as it remained fixed on the lifeless form
before her.”

“who is this lady rowena,” said prince john, “of whom we have heard so
much?”

“a saxon heiress of large possessions,” replied the prior aymer; “a rose
of loveliness, and a jewel of wealth; the fairest among a thousand, a
bundle of myrrh, and a cluster of camphire.”

“we shall che

 livings, by wedding a saxon, after the fashion
of the followers of the conqueror?”

“if the lands are to my liking, my lord,” answered de bracy, “it will be
hard to displease me with a bride; and deeply will i hold myself bound
to your highness for a good deed, which will fulfil all promises made in
favour of your servant and vassal.”

“we will not forget it,” said prince john; “and that we may instantly go
to work, command our seneschal presently to order the attendance of the
lady rowena and her company--that is, the rude churl her guardian, and
the saxon ox whom the black knight struck down in the tournament, upon
this evening’s banquet.--de bigot,” he added to his seneschal, “thou
wilt word this our second summons so courteously, as to gratify the
pride of these saxons, and make it impossible for them again to refuse;
although, by the bones of becket, courtesy to them is casting pearls
before swine.”

prince john had proceeded thus far, and was about to give the signa

 wounds for whose
sake he encountered them. he is fitter to do the juggling tricks of
the norman chivalry than to maintain the fame and honour of his english
ancestry with the glaive and brown-bill, the good old weapons of his
country.”

“if to maintain the honour of ancestry,” said rowena, who was present,
“it is sufficient to be wise in council and brave in execution--to be
boldest among the bold, and gentlest among the gentle, i know no voice,
save his father’s---”

“be silent, lady rowena!--on this subject only i hear you not. prepare
yourself for the prince’s festival: we have been summoned thither with
unwonted circumstance of honour and of courtesy, such as the haughty
normans have rarely used to our race since the fatal day of hastings.
thither will i go, were it only to show these proud normans how little
the fate of a son, who could defeat their bravest, can affect a saxon.”

or talents to recommend him as a leader, he had still a goodly person,

above all, he was known to be liberal and hospitable, and believed to be
good-natured. but whatever pretensions athelstane had to be considered
as head of the saxon confederacy, many of that nation were disposed
to prefer to the title of the lady rowena, who drew her descent from
alfred, and whose father having been a chief renowned for wisdom,
courage, and generosity, his memory was highly honoured by his oppressed
countrymen.

it would have been no difficult thing for cedric, had he been so
disposed, to have placed himself at the head of a third party, as
formidable at least as any of the others. to counterbalance their royal
descent, he had courage, activity, energy, and, above all, that devoted
attachment to the cause which had procured hi

was disarmed by the violence of his own blow. he was instantly made
prisoner, and pulled from his horse by two or three of the banditti who
crowded around him. athelstane shared his captivity, his bridle having
been seized, and he himself forcibly dismounted, long before he could
draw his weapon, or assume any posture of effectual defence.

the attendants, embarrassed with baggage, surprised and terrified at the
fate of their masters, fell an easy prey to the assailants; while
the lady rowena, in the centre of the cavalcade, and the jew and his
daughter in the rear, experienced the same misfortune.

of all the train none escaped except wamba, who showed upon the
occasion much more courage than those who pretended to greater sense. he
possessed himself of a sword belonging to one of the domestics, who was
just drawing it with a tardy and irresolute hand, laid it about him like
a lion, drove back several who approached him, and made a brave though
ineffectual attempt to succour his ma

roached to the other side of the hut, had heard the
conclusion of the conversation,--“so we have got a new ally?--l trust
the valour of the knight will be truer metal than the religion of the
hermit, or the honesty of the yeoman; for this locksley looks like a
born deer-stealer, and the priest like a lusty hypocrite.”

“hold thy peace, wamba,” said gurth; “it may all be as thou dost guess;
but were the horned devil to rise and proffer me his assistance to
set at liberty cedric and the lady rowena, i fear i should hardly have
religion enough to refuse the foul fiend’s offer, and bid him get behind
me.”

the friar was now completely accoutred as a yeoman, with sword and
buckler, bow, and quiver, and a strong partisan over his shoulder. he
left his cell at the head of the party, and, having carefully locked the
door, deposited the key under the threshold.

the cavalcade now moved
rapidly forward. meanwhile, the following dialogue took place between
the two leaders of the banditti.

“it is time thou shouldst leave us, sir maurice,” said the templar to
de bracy, “in order to prepare the second part of thy mystery. thou art
next, thou knowest, to act the knight deliverer.”

“i have thought better of it,” said de bracy; “i will not leave thee
till the prize is fairly deposited in front-de-boeuf’s castle. there
will i appear before the lady rowena in mine own shape, and trust that
she will set down to the vehemence of my passion the violence of which i
have been guilty.”

“and what has made thee change thy plan, de bracy?” replied the knight
templar.

“that concerns thee nothing,” answered his companion.

“i would hope, however, sir knight,” said the templar, “that this
alteration of measures arises from no suspicion of my honourable
meaning, such as fitzurse endeavoured to instil into thee?”

“my thoughts are my own,

wolves of france. tell me, dogs--is it my life or my wealth that your
master aims at? is it too much that two saxons, myself and the noble
athelstane, should hold land in the country which was once the patrimony
of our race?--put us then to death, and complete your tyranny by taking
our lives, as you began with our liberties. if the saxon cedric cannot
rescue england, he is willing to die for her. tell your tyrannical
master, i do only beseech him to dismiss the lady rowena in honour and
safety. she is a woman, and he need not dread her; and with us will die
all who dare fight in her cause.”

the attendants remained as mute to this address as to the former, and
they now stood before the gate of the castle. de bracy winded his horn
three times, and the archers and cross-bow men, who had manned the wall
upon seeing their approach, hastened to lower the drawbridge, and admit
them. the prisoners were compelled by their guards to alight, and were

the descendant of the confessor much time to do justice to the good
cheer placed before them, for their guards gave him and cedric to
understand that they were to be imprisoned in a chamber apart from
rowena. resistance was vain; and they were compelled to follow to a
large room, which, rising on clumsy saxon pillars, resembled those
refectories and chapter-houses which may be still seen in the most
ancient parts of our most ancient monasteries.

the lady rowena was next separated from her train, and conducted, with
courtesy, indeed, but still without consulting her inclination, to
a distant apartment. the same alarming distinction was conferred on
rebecca, in spite of her father’s entreaties, who offered even money,
in this extremity of distress, that she might be permitted to abide with
him. “base unbeliever,” answered one of his guards, “when thou hast seen
thy lair, thou wilt not wish thy daughter to partake it.” and, without

the apartment to which the lady rowena had been introduced was fitted
up with some rude attempts at ornament and magnificence, and her being
placed there might be considered as a peculiar mark of respect not
offered to the other prisoners. but the wife of front-de-boeuf, for whom
it had been originally furnished, was long dead, and decay and neglect
had impaired the few ornaments with which her taste had adorned it.

this had been settled in a council
held by front-de-boeuf, de bracy, and the templar, in which, after
a long and warm debate concerning the several advantages which each
insisted upon deriving from his peculiar share in this audacious
enterprise, they had at length determined the fate of their unhappy
prisoners.

it was about the hour of noon, therefore, when de bracy, for whose
advantage the expedition had been first planned, appeared to prosecute
his views upon the hand and possessions of the lady rowena.

the interval had not entirely been bestowed in holding council with his
confederates, for de bracy had found leisure to decorate his person
with all the foppery of the times. his green cassock and vizard were
now flung aside. his long luxuriant hair was trained to flow in quaint
tresses down his richly furred cloak. his beard was closely shaved, his
doublet reached to the middle of his leg, and the girdle which secured
it, and at the same time supported his ponderous sword, was embroidered

“to heralds and to minstrels, then, leave thy praise, sir knight,”
 replied rowena, “more suiting for their mouths than for thine own; and
tell me which of them shall record in song, or in book of tourney, the
memorable conquest of this night, a conquest obtained over an old man,
followed by a few timid hinds; and its booty, an unfortunate maiden,
transported against her will to the castle of a robber?”

“you are unjust, lady rowena,” said the knight, biting his lips in
some confusion, and speaking in a tone more natural to him than that of
affected gallantry, which he had at first adopted; “yourself free from
passion, you can allow no excuse for the frenzy of another, although
caused by your own beauty.”

“i pray you, sir knight,” said rowena, “to cease a language so commonly
used by strolling minstrels, that it becomes not the mouth of knights or
nobles. certes, you constrain me to sit down, since you enter u

ts, he could only bid the unfortunate rowena be
comforted, and assure her, that as yet she had no reason for the
excess of despair to which she was now giving way. but in this task of
consolation de bracy was interrupted by the horn, “hoarse-winded blowing
far and keen,” which had at the same time alarmed the other inmates
of the castle, and interrupted their several plans of avarice and
of license. of them all, perhaps, de bracy least regretted the
interruption; for his conference with the lady rowena had arrived at a
point, where he found it equally difficult to prosecute or to resign his
enterprise.

and here we cannot but think it necessary to offer some better proof
than the incidents of an idle tale, to vindicate the melancholy
representation of manners which has been just laid before the reader. it

later and more reluctantly, and therefore i presume your interview has
proved more agreeable than mine.”

“has your suit, then, been unsuccessfully paid to the saxon heiress?”
 said the templar.

“by the bones of thomas a becket,” answered de bracy, “the lady rowena
must have heard that i cannot endure the sight of women’s tears.”

“away!” said the templar; “thou a leader of a free company, and regard
a woman’s tears! a few drops sprinkled on the torch of love, make the
flame blaze the brighter.”

“gramercy for the few drops of thy sprinkling,” replied de bracy; “but
this damsel hath wept enough to extinguish a beacon-light. never was
such wringing of hands and such overflowing of eyes, since the days of
st niobe, of whom prior aymer to

called for the present ‘le noir faineant’, and the stout yeoman, robert

your allies and accomplices whomsoever, to wit, that whereas you have,
without cause given or feud declared, wrongfully and by mastery seized
upon the person of our lord and master the said cedric; also upon
the person of a noble and freeborn damsel, the lady rowena of
hargottstandstede; also upon the person of a noble and freeborn man,
athelstane of coningsburgh; also upon the persons of certain freeborn
men, their ‘cnichts’; also upon certain serfs, their born bondsmen; also
upon a certain jew, named isaac of york, together with his daughter, a
jewess, and certain horses and mules: which noble persons, with their
‘cnichts’ and slaves, and also with the horses and mules, jew and jewess
beforesaid, were all in peace with his majesty, and travelling

t is a trifling ransom, saxon, and thou wilt owe gratitude to
the moderation which accepts of it in exchange of your persons. but
mark, this extends not to the jew isaac.”

“nor to the jew isaac’s daughter,” said the templar, who had now joined
them.

“neither,” said front-de-boeuf, “belong to this saxon’s company.”

“i were unworthy to be called christian, if they did,” replied
athelstane: “deal with the unbelievers as ye list.”

“neither does the ransom include the lady rowena,” said de bracy. “it
shall never be said i was scared out of a fair prize without striking a
blow for it.”

“neither,” said front-de-boeuf, “does our treaty refer to this wretched
jester, whom i retain, that i may make him an example to every knave who
turns jest into earnest.”

“the lady rowena,” answered athelstane, with the most steady
countenance, “is my affianced bride. i will be drawn by wild horses
before i consent to part with her. the slave wamba has this day saved

the life of my father cedric--i will lose mine ere a hair of his head be
injured.”

“thy affianced bride?--the lady rowena the affianced bride of a vassal
like thee?” said de bracy; “saxon, thou dreamest that the days of thy
seven kingdoms are returned again. i tell thee, the princes of the house
of anjou confer not their wards on men of such lineage as thine.”

“my lineage, proud norman,” replied athelstane, “is drawn from a source
more pure and ancient than that of a beggarly frenchman, whose living
is won by selling the blood of the thieves whom he assembles under his
paltry standard. kings were my a

red amid the prayers of saints, and over whose tombs minsters have
been builded.”

“thou hast it, de bracy,” said front-de-boeuf, well pleased with the
rebuff which his companion had received; “the saxon hath hit thee
fairly.”

“as fairly as a captive can strike,” said de bracy, with apparent
carelessness; “for he whose hands are tied should have his tongue at
freedom.--but thy glibness of reply, comrade,” rejoined he, speaking to
athelstane, “will not win the freedom of the lady rowena.”

to this athelstane, who had already made a longer speech than was his
custom to do on any topic, however interesting, returned no answer. the
conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a menial, who announced
that a monk demanded admittance at the postern gate.

“in the name of saint bennet, the prince of these bull-beggars,” said
front-de-boeuf, “have we a real monk this time, or another impostor?
search him, slaves--for an ye suffer a second impostor to be palmed

iet as these disquieted times will
permit--and of cedric and his household?”

“his steward came but brief while since,” said the jewess, “panting with
haste, to ask my father for certain monies, the price of wool the growth
of cedric’s flocks, and from him i learned that cedric and athelstane
of coningsburgh had left prince john’s lodging in high displeasure, and
were about to set forth on their return homeward.”

“went any lady with them to the banquet?” said wilfred.

“the lady rowena,” said rebecca, answering the question with more
precision than it had been asked--“the lady rowena went not to the
prince’s feast, and, as the steward reported to us, she is now on her
journey back to rotherwood, with her guardian cedric. and touching your
faithful squire gurth---”

“ha!” exclaimed the knight, “knowest thou his name?--but thou dost,” he
immediately added, “and well thou mayst, for it was from thy hand, and,
as i am now convinced, from thine own generosity of

cries, and without regarding the menaces and defiance which ivanhoe
thundered against him. “hound of the temple--stain to thine order--set
free the damsel! traitor of bois-guilbert, it is ivanhoe commands
thee!--villain, i will have thy heart’s blood!”

“i had not found thee, wilfred,” said the black knight, who at that
instant entered the apartment, “but for thy shouts.”

“if thou be’st true knight,” said wilfred, “think not of me--pursue yon
ravisher--save the lady rowena--look to the noble cedric!”

“in their turn,” answered he of the fetterlock, “but thine is first.”

and seizing upon ivanhoe, he bore him off with as much ease as the
templar had carried off rebecca, rushed with him to the postern, and
having there delivered his burden to the care of two yeomen, he again
entered the castle to assist in the rescue of the other prisoners.

one turret was now in bright flames, which flashed out furiously from
window and shot-hole. but in other parts, the

athelstane, who, as the reader knows, was slothful, but not cowardly,
beheld the female form whom the templar protected thus sedulously, and
doubted not that it was rowena whom the knight was carrying off, in
despite of all resistance which could be offered.

“by the soul of saint edward,” he said, “i will rescue her from yonder
over-proud knight, and he shall die by my hand!”

“think what you do!” cried wamba; “hasty hand catches frog for fish--by
my bauble, yonder is none of my lady rowena--see but her long dark
locks!--nay, an ye will not know black from white, ye may be leader, but
i will be no follower--no bones of mine shall be broken unless i know
for whom.--and you without armour too!--bethink you, silk bonnet never
kept out steel blade.--nay, then, if wilful will to water, wilful must
drench.--‘deus vobiscum’, most doughty athelstane!”--he concluded,
loosening the hold which he had hitherto kept upon the saxon’s tunic.

who were partakers with us in this adventure.”

“good yeoman,” said cedric, “my heart is oppressed with sadness. the
noble athelstane of coningsburgh is no more--the last sprout of
the sainted confessor! hopes have perished with him which can never
return!--a sparkle hath been quenched by his blood, which no human
breath can again rekindle! my people, save the few who are now with me,
do but tarry my presence to transport his honoured remains to their last
mansion. the lady rowena is desirous to return to rotherwood, and must
be escorted by a sufficient force. i should, therefore, ere now, have
left this place; and i waited--not to share the booty, for, so help me
god and saint withold! as neither i nor any of mine will touch the value
of a liard,--i waited but to render my thanks to thee and to thy bold
yeomen, for the life and honour ye have saved.”

“nay, but,” said the chief outlaw, “we did but half the work at
most--take of the spoil what may reward your own

thou art likely to forget both us
and thyself.”

“i shall forget myself indeed ere i forget thee, true comrade,” said
gurth; “and were freedom fit for thee, wamba, the master would not let
thee want it.”

“nay,” said wamba, “never think i envy thee, brother gurth; the serf
sits by the hall-fire when the freeman must forth to the field of
battle--and what saith oldhelm of malmsbury--better a fool at a feast
than a wise man at a fray.”

the tramp of horses was now heard, and the lady rowena appeared,
surrounded by several riders, and a much stronger party of footmen, who
joyfully shook their pikes and clashed their brown-bills for joy of her
freedom. she herself, richly attired, and mounted on a dark chestnut
palfrey, had recovered all the dignity of her manner, and only an
unwonted degree of paleness showed the sufferings she had undergone. her
lovely brow, though sorrowful, bore on it a cast of reviving hope
for the future, as well as of grateful thankfulness for the past

rowena has food--if you should thirst, she has many a butt of wine and
brown ale--and if the normans drive ye from these walks, rowena has
forests of her own, where her gallant deliverers may range at full
freedom, and never ranger ask whose arrow hath struck down the deer.”

“thanks, gentle lady,” said locksley; “thanks from my company and
myself. but, to have saved you requites itself. we who walk the
greenwood do many a wild deed, and the lady rowena’s deliverance may be
received as an atonement.”

again bowing from her palfrey, rowena turned to depart; but pausing a
moment, while cedric, who was to attend her, was also taking his leave,
she found herself unexpectedly close by the prisoner de bracy. he stood
under a tree in deep meditation, his arms crossed upon his breast,
and rowena was in hopes she might pass him unobserved. he looked up,
however, and, when aware of her presence, a deep flush of shame suffused
his handsome countenanc

e. he stood a moment most irresolute; then,
stepping forward, took her palfrey by the rein, and bent his knee before
her.

“will the lady rowena deign to cast an eye--on a captive knight--on a
dishonoured soldier?”

“sir knight,” answered rowena, “in enterprises such as yours, the real
dishonour lies not in failure, but in success.”

“conquest, lady, should soften the heart,” answered de bracy; “let me
but know that the lady rowena forgives the violence occasioned by an
ill-fated passion, and she shall soon learn that de bracy knows how to
serve her in nobler ways.”

“i forgive you, sir knight,” said rowena, “as a christian.”

“that means,” said wamba, “that she does not forgive him at all.”

“but i can never forgive the misery and desolation your madness has
occasioned,” continued rowena.

“unloose your hold on the lady’s rein,” said cedric, coming up. “by the
bright sun above us, but it wer

feet, “grant me thy forgiveness!”

“thou hast it, my son,” said cedric, raising him up. “the son of
hereward knows how to keep his word, even when it has been passed to
a norman. but let me see thee use the dress and costume of thy english
ancestry--no short cloaks, no gay bonnets, no fantastic plumage in my
decent household. he that would be the son of cedric, must show himself
of english ancestry.--thou art about to speak,” he added, sternly, “and
i guess the topic. the lady rowena must complete two years’ mourning, as
for a betrothed husband--all our saxon ancestors would disown us were
we to treat of a new union for her ere the grave of him she should
have wedded--him, so much the most worthy of her hand by birth and
ancestry--is yet closed. the ghost of athelstane himself would burst
his bloody cerements and stand before us to forbid such dishonour to his
memory.”

it seemed as if cedric’s words had raised a spectre; for, scarce had
he uttered them ere the door f

but hurried journeys, indigestions, blows and bruises, imprisonments
and starvation; besides that they can only end in the murder of some
thousands of quiet folk. i tell you, i will be king in my own domains,
and nowhere else; and my first act of dominion shall be to hang the
abbot.”

“and my ward rowena,” said cedric--“i trust you intend not to desert
her?”

“father cedric,” said athelstane, “be reasonable. the lady rowena cares
not for me--she loves the little finger of my kinsman wilfred’s glove
better than my whole person. there she stands to avouch it--nay, blush
not, kinswoman, there is no shame in loving a courtly knight better than
a country franklin--and do not laugh neither, rowena, for grave-clothes
and a thin visage are, god knows, no matter of merriment--nay, an thou
wilt needs laugh, i will find thee a better jest--give me thy hand, or
rather lend it me, for i but ask it in the way of friendship.--

on cause, he could not have anticipated, and even
when the disinclination of both was broadly and plainly manifested, he
could scarce bring himself to believe that two saxons of royal descent
should scruple, on personal grounds, at an alliance so necessary for the
public weal of the nation. but it was not the less certain: rowena had
always expressed her repugnance to athelstane, and now athelstane was
no less plain and positive in proclaiming his resolution never to pursue
his addresses to the lady rowena. even the natural obstinacy of cedric
sunk beneath these obstacles, where he, remaining on the point of
junction, had the task of dragging a reluctant pair up to it, one with
each hand. he made, however, a last vigorous attack on athelstane, and
he found that resuscitated sprout of saxon royalty engaged, like country
squires of our own day, in a furious war with the clergy.

it seems that, after all his deadly menaces against the abbot of saint
edmund’s, athelstane’s spirit of revenge, what

in which she was shrouded, overshadowing rather than concealing the
elegance and majesty of her shape. her demeanour was that of respect,
unmingled by the least shade either of fear, or of a wish to propitiate
favour. rowena was ever ready to acknowledge the claims, and attend to
the feelings, of others. she arose, and would have conducted her
lovely visitor to a seat; but the stranger looked at elgitha, and again
intimated a wish to discourse with the lady rowena alone. elgitha had no
sooner retired with unwilling steps, than, to the surprise of the lady
of ivanhoe, her fair visitant kneeled on one knee, pressed her hands to
her forehead, and bending her head to the ground, in spite of rowena’s
resistance, kissed the embroidered hem of her tunic.

“what means this, lady?” said the surprised bride; “or why do you offer
to me a deference so unusual?”

“because to you, lady of ivanhoe,” said rebecca, rising up and resuming
the usual quiet dig
