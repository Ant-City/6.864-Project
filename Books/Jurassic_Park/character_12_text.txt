attraction was. the firms were all designing teaser campaigns, nothing specific, and they were
unhappy. creative people needed nurturing. they needed encouragement to do their best work.
he couldn't waste his time taking scientists on tours.
but that was the trouble with a career in public relations-nobody saw you as a professional.
regis had been down here on the island off and on for the past seven months, and they were still
pushing odd jobs on him. like that episode back in january. harding should have handled that.
harding, or owens, the general contractor. instead, it had fallen to ed regis. what did he know
about taking care of some sick workman? and now he was a damn tour guide and babysitter. he
turned back and counted the heads. still one short.
then, in the back, he saw dr. sattler emerge from the bathroom. "all right, folks, let's begin our
tour on the second floor."
tim went with the others, following mr. regis up the black suspended staircase to the second

ing in the room. looking out, he could see the two land
cruisers moving south through the park. muldoon stood in the corner, silently watching.
arnold pushed his chair back from the central console at the control panel. "there are no minor
details, mr. hammond," he said, and he lit another cigarette. nervous at most times, arnold was
especially edgy now. he was only too aware that this was the first time visitors had actually
toured the park. in fact, arnold's team didn't often go into the park. harding, the vet, sometimes
did. the animal handlers went to the individual feeding houses. but otherwise they watched the
park from the control room. and now, with visitors out there, he worried about a hundred details.
john arnold was a systems engineer who had worked on the polaris submarine missile in the
late 1960s, until he had his first child and the prospect of making weapons became too
distasteful. meanwhile, disney had started to create amusement park rides of great technological

"see you in two weeks," the voice said.
on the video monitor, they saw the crew on the decks, casting off the lines. arnold turned back
to the main console bank. he saw the land cruisers moving through fields of steam.
"where are they now?" hammond said.
"it looks like the south fields," arnold said. the southern end of the island had more volcanic
activity than the north. "that means they should be almost to the stegos. i'm sure they'll stop and
see what harding is doing."
stegosaur
as the land cruiser came to a stop, ellie sattler stared through the plumes of steam at the
stegosaurus. it was standing quietly, not moving. a jeep with a red stripe was parked alongside it.
"i have to admit, that's a funny-looking animal," malcolm said.
the stegosaurus was twenty feet long, with a huge bulky body and vertical armor plates along
its back. the tail had dangerous-looking three-foot spikes. but the neck tapered to an absurdly
small head with a stupid gaze, li

ke a very dumb horse.
as they watched, a man walked around from behind the animal. "that's our vet, dr. harding,"
regis said, over the radio. "he's anesthetized the stego, which is why it's not moving. it's sick."
grant was already getting out of the car, hurrying toward the motionless stegosaur. ellie got
out and looked back as the second land cruiser pulled up and the two kids jumped out. "what's
he sick with?" tim said.
"they're not sure," ellie said.
the great leathery plates along the stegosaur's spine drooped slightly. it breathed slowly,
laboriously, making a wet sound with each breath.

aid.
the dark purple tongue drooped limply from the animal's mouth. the vet shone a light on it so
she could see the very fine silvery blisters. "microvesicles," ellie said. "interesting."
"we've had a difficult time with these stegos," the vet said. "they're always getting sick."
"what are the symptoms?" ellie asked. she scratched the tongue with her fingernail. a clear
liquid exuded from the broken blisters.
"ugh," lex said,
"imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing, and massive diarrhea," harding said. "seems to
happen about once every six weeks or so."
"they feed continuously?"
"oh yes," harding said. "animal this size has to take in a minimum of five or six hundred
pounds of plant matter daily just to keep going. they're constant foragers."
"then it's not likely to be poisoning from a plant," ellie said. constant browsers would be
constantly sick if they were eating a toxic plant. not every six weeks.
"exactly," the vet said.
"may i?" ellie asked. she took the flashlight from the vet.

ated, and did not contract
when light shone on it. "i'll be damned," he said. "that's a pharmacological effect."
"yes." ellie got back on her feet and looked around. "what is the animal's range?"
"about five square miles."
"in this general area?" she asked. they were in an open meadow, with scattered rocky
outcrops, and intermittent plumes of steam rising from the ground. it was late afternoon, and the
sky was pink beneath the lowering gray clouds.
"their range is mostly north and cast of here," harding said. "but when they get sick, they're
usually somewhere around this particular area."
it was an interesting puzzle, she thought. how to explain the periodicity of the poisoning? she
pointed across the field. "you see those low, delicate-looking bushes?"
"west indian lilac." harding nodded. "we know it's toxic. the animals don't eat it."
"you're sure?"
"yes. we monitor them on video, and i've checked droppings just to be certain. the stegos
never eat the lilac bushes."

dilatation." she set off toward the field to examine the plants more closely, her body bent over the
ground. "you're right," she said. "plants are healthy, no sign of being eaten. none at all."
"and there's the six-week interval," the vet reminded her.
"the stegosaurs come here how often?"
"about once a week," he said. "stegos make a slow loop through their home-range territory,
feeding as they go. they complete the loop in about a week."
"but they're only sick once every six weeks."
"correct," harding said.
"this is boring," lex said. 
"ssshb," tim said. "dr. sattler's trying to think."
"unsuccessfully," ellie said, walking farther out into the field.
behind her, she heard lex saying, "anybody want to play a little pickle?"
ellie stared at the ground. the field was rocky in many places. she could hear the sound of the
surf, somewhere to the left. there were berries among the rocks. perhaps the animals were just
eating berries. but that didn't make sense. west indian lilac berries were terrib

painfully, perhaps even dangerously. but life finds a way." malcolm shook his head. "i don't mean
to be philosophical, but there it is."
gennaro looked over. ellie and grant were across the field, waving their arms and shouting.
"did you get my coke?" dennis nedry asked, as muldoon came back into the control room.
muldoon didn't bother to answer. he went directly to the monitor and looked at what was
happening. over the radio he heard harding's voice saying, "-the stego-finally-handle on-now-"
"what's that about?" muldoon said.
"they're down by the south point," arnold said. "that's why they're breaking up a little. i'll
switch them to another channel. but they found out what's wrong with the stegos. eating some
kind of berry."
hammond nodded. "i knew we'd solve that sooner or later," he said.
"it's not very impressive," gennaro said. he held the white fragment, no larger than a postage

interior curve. turn it over and you will notice a faint pattern of raised lines, making roughly
triangular shapes."
"yes, i see them."
"well, i've dug out two eggs with patterns like that at my site in montana."
"you're saying this is a piece of dinosaur eggshell?"
"absolutely," grant said.
harding shook his head. "these dinosaurs can't breed."
"evidently they can," gennaro said.
"that must be a bird egg," harding said. "we have literally dozens of species on the island."
grant shook his head. "look at the curvature. the shell is almost flat. that's from a very big
egg. and notice the thickness of the shell. unless you have ostriches on this island, it's a
dinosaur egg."
"but they can't possibly breed," harding insisted. "all the animals are female."
"all i know," grant said, "is that this is a dinosaur egg."
malcolm said, "can you tell the species?" "yes,"
grant said. "it's a velociraptor egg."

to run one of his computer tallies."
"now?"
"yes, right now. i understand you can transmit it to the screen in dr. harding's car. do that,
too, will you?"
"no problem," arnold said. a moment later, the screen in the control room printed out:

"can we go back now?" lex said. "i'm hungry."
"yes, let's go," grant said, smiling at her. "you've been very patient."
"you'll be able to eat in about twenty minutes," ed regis said, starting toward the two land
cruisers.
"i'll stay for a while," ellie said, "and get photos of the stego with dr. harding's camera. those

"i want to get back," grant said. "i'll go with the kids." "i
will, too," malcolm said.
"i think i'll stay," gennaro said, "and go back with harding in his jeep, with dr. sattler."

along the side of the road, clouds of volcanic steam misted rainbows in the bright quartz lights.
grant said into the radio, "how long does it take the ship to reach the mainland?"
"eighteen hours," ed regis said. "more or less. it's pretty reliable." he glanced at his watch. "it
should arrive around eleven tomorrow morning."
grant frowned. "you still can't talk to the control room?"
"not so far."
"how about harding? can you reach him?"
"no, i've tried. he may have his radio turned off."
malcolm was shaking his head. "so we're the only ones who know about the animals on the
ship."
"i'm trying to raise somebody," ed regis said. "i mean, christ, we don't want those animals on
the mainland."
"how long until we get back to the base?"
"from here, another sixteen, seventeen minutes," ed regis said.

movement. so long as he stood his ground, grant realized, he was invisible.
in a final gesture of frustration, the big hind leg lifted up and kicked the land cruiser over, and
grant felt searing pain and the surprising sensation of his own body flying through the air. it
seemed to be happening very slowly, and he had plenty of time to feel the world turn colder, and
watch the ground rush up to strike him in the face.

"oh damn," harding said. "will you look at that."
they were sitting in harding's gasoline-powered jeep, staring forward past the flick flick of the
windshield wipers. in the yellow flare of the headlamps, a big fallen tree blocked the road.
"must have been the lightning," gennaro said. "hell of a tree."
"we can't get past it," harding said. "i better tell arnold in control." he picked up the radio and
twisted the channel dial. "hello, john. are you there, john?"
there was nothing but steady hissing static. "i don

harding opened the other channels, but there was no answer.
"nothing," he said. "they're probably back to camp by now, and outside the range of our little
set. in any case, i don't think we should stay here. it'll be hours before maintenance gets a crew
out here to move that tree."
he turned the radio off, and put the jeep into reverse.

the animals at night. we should be back in thirty, forty minutes," harding said. "if i don't get lost."
he turned the jeep around in the night, and headed south again.
lightning flashed, and every monitor in the control room went black.
arnold sat forward, his body rigid and tense. jesus, not now. not now. that was all he neededto
have everything go out now in the storm. all the main power circuits were surge-protected, of
course, but arnold wasn't sure about the modems nedry was using for his data transmission.

s he came back in the room. "have you
talked to the land cruisers yet?"
"can't raise them on the radio," arnold said. "i have to use this, because the main board is
down. it's weak, but it ought to work. i've tried on all six channels. i know they have radios in the
cars, but they're not answering."
"that's not good," muldoon said.
"if you want to go out there, take one of the maintenance vehicles."
"i would," muldoon said, "but they're all in the east garage, more than a mile from here.
where's harding?"
"i assume he's on his way back."
"then he'll pick up the people in the land cruisers on his way."
"i assume so."
"anybody tell hammond the kids aren't back yet?"
"hell no," arnold said. "i don't want that son of a bitch running around here, screaming at me.
everytbing's all right, for the moment. the land cruisers are just stuck in the rain. they can sit a

"then look in the lodge," arnold said, "look in the maintenance building, look in the utility shed,
look everywhere, but just find him."
"the thing is . . ." the guard hesitated. "mr. nedry's the fat man, is that right?"
"that's right," arnold said. "he's fat. a fat slob."
"well, jimmy down in the main lobby said he saw the fat man go into the garage."
muldoon spun around. "into the garage? when?"
"about ten, fifteen minutes ago."
"jesus," muldoon said.
the jeep screeched to a stop. "sorry," harding said. 
in the headlamps, ellie saw a herd of apatosaurs lumbering across the road. there were six
animals, each the size of a house, and a baby as large as a full-grown horse. the apatosaurs
moved in unhurried silence, never looking toward the jeep and its glowing headlamps. at one
point, the baby stopped to lap water from a puddle in the road, then moved on.
a comparable herd of elephants would have been startled by the arrival of a car, would have
trumpeted and circled to protect the baby. bu

t these animals showed no fear. "don't they see
us?" she said.
"not exactly, no," harding said. "of course, in a literal sense they do see us, but we don't really
mean anything to them. we hardly ever take cars out at night, and so they have no experience of
them. we are just a strange, smelly object in their environment. representing no threat, and
therefore no interest. i've occasionally been out at night, visiting a sick animal, and on my way
back these fellows blocked the road for an hour or more.

harding grinned. "play a recorded tyrannosaur roar. that gets th

they can break a tyrannosaur's neck with a swipe of their tail. and they know it. so does the
tyrannosaur."
"but they do see us. i mean, if we were to get out of the car . . ."
harding shrugged. "they probably wouldn't react. dinosaurs have excellent visual acuity, but
they have a basic amphibian visual system: it's attuned to movement. they don't see unmoving
things well at all."
the animals moved on, their skin glistening in the rain. harding put the car in gear. "i think we
can continue now," he said.
wu said, "i suspect you may find there are pressures on your park, just as there are pressures on
genentech's drugs." he and hammond had moved to the living room, and they were now
watching the storm lash the big glass windows.
"i can't see how," hammond said.
"the scientists may wish to constrain you. even to stop you.

they'll love it."
in the back seat of the jeep, ellie sattler stared out the window. they had been driving through
rain-drenched jungle for the last twenty minutes, and had seen nothing since the apatosaurs
crossed the road.
"we're near the jungle river now," harding said, as he drove. "it's off there somewhere to our
left."
abruptly he slammed on the brakes again, the car skidded to a stop in front of a flock of small
green animals. "well, you're getting quite a show tonight," he said. "those are compys."
procompsognathids, ellie thought, wishing that grant were here to see them. this was the
animal they had seen in the fax, back in montana. the little dark green procompsognathids
scurried to the other side of the road, then squatted on their hind legs to

chattering briefly, before hurrying onward into the night. 
"odd," harding said. "wonder where they're off to? compys don't usually move at night, you
know. they climb up in a tree and wait for daylight."
"then why are they out now?" ellie said.
"i can't imagine. you know compys are scavengers, like buzzards. they're attracted to a dying
animal, and they have tremendously sensitive smell. they can smell a dying animal for miles."
"then they're going to a dying animal?"
"dying, or already dead."
"should we follow them?" ellie said.

his jaws.
"oh no," lex said, softly. beside her, tim had turned away, suddenly nauseated. his nightvision
goggles slipped from his forehead and landed on the ground with a metallic clink.
the juvenile's head snapped up, and it looked toward the top of the hill.
tim picked up his goggles as grant grabbed both the children's hands and began to run.

in the night, the compys scurried along the side of the road. harding's jeep followed a short
distance behind. ellie pointed farther up the road. "is that a light?"
"could be," harding said. "looks almost like headlights."
the radio suddenly bummed and crackled. they heard john arnold say,

"ah, there he is," harding said. "finally." he pressed the button. "yes, john, we're here. we're

he turned the radio off, and turned the car around. "i just wish i understood what the urgency is."
harding put the jeep in gear, and they rumbled down the road in the darkness. it was another
ten minutes before they saw the welcoming lights of the safari lodge. and as harding pulled to a
stop in front of the visitor center, they saw muldoon coming toward them. he was shouting, and
waving his arms.
"god damn it, arnold, you son of a bitch! god damn it, get this park back on track! now! get my
grandkids back here! now!" john hammond stood in the control room, screaming and stamping
his little feet. he had been carrying on this way for the last two minutes, while henry wu stood in

muldoon took the curve very fast, the jeep sliding on the mud. sitting beside him, gennaro
clenched his fists. they were racing along the cliff road, high above the river, now hidden below
them in darkness. muldoon accelerated forward. his face was tense.
"how much farther?" gennaro said. "two, maybe three miles."
ellie and harding were back at the visitor center. gennaro had offered to accompany muldoon.
the car swerved. "it's been an hour," muldoon said. "an hour, with no word from the other cars."
"but they have radios," gennaro said.
"we haven't been able to raise them," muldoon said.
gennaro frowned. "if i was sitting in a car for an hour in the rain, i'd sure try to use the radio to
call for somebody."
"so would i," muldoon said.
gennaro shook his head. "you really think something could have happened to them?"

 wet clothes, when there was a knock on the
door.
"alan?" she said, but when she opened the door she saw muldoon standing there, with a
plastic-wrapped package under his arm. muldoon was also soaking wet, and there were streaks of
dirt on his clothes.
"i'm sorry, but we need your help," muldoon said briskly. "the land cruisers were attacked an
hour ago. we brought malcolm back, but he's in shock. he's got a very bad injury to his leg. he's
still unconscious, but i put him in the bed in his room. harding is on his way over."
"harding?" she said. "what about the others?"
"we haven't found the others yet, dr. sattler," muldoon said. he was speaking slowly now.
"oh, my god."
"but we think that dr. grant and the children are still alive. we think they went into the park, dr.
sattler."
"went into the park?"
"we think so. meanwhile, malcolm needshelp. i've called harding."
'shouldn't you call the doctor?"
"there's no doctor on the island. harding's the best we have." "but

"no." muldoon shook his head. "phone lines are down. we can't call out." he shifted the
package in his arm.
"what's that?" she said.
"nothing. just go to malcolm's room, and help harding, if you will." and
muldoon was gone.
she sat on her bed, shocked. ellie sattler was not a woman disposed to unnecessary panic,
and she had known grant to get out of dangerous situations before. once he'd been lost in the
badlands for four days when a cliff gave way beneath him and his truck fell a hundred feet into a
ravine. grant's right leg was broken. he had no water. but he walked back on a broken leg.

muldoon shook his head. "we better get on with it," he said. "we need to repair the fences,
and get the animals back into their paddocks. according to that computer, we've got five to herd
back to the proper paddocks. i'll take the maintenance crews out now."
arnold turned to gennaro. "you may want to see how dr. malcolm is doing. tell dr. harding
that muldoon will need him in about an hour to supervise the herding. and i'll notify mr. hammond
that we're starting our final cleanup."
gennaro passed through the iron gates and went in the front door of the safari lodge. he saw
ellie sattler coming down the hallway, carrying towels and a pan of steaming water. "there's a
kitchen at the other end," she said. "we're using that to boil water for the dressings."
"how is he?" gennaro asked.
"surprisingly good," she said.

laughter. the mathematician lay on his back in the bed, with harding adjusting an iv line.
"so the other man says, 'i'll tell you frankly, i didn't like it, bill. i went back to toilet paper!'"
harding was laughing. 
"it's not bad, is it?" malcolm said, smiling. "ah. mr. gennaro. you've come to see me. now you
know what happens from trying to get a leg up on the situation."
gennaro came in, tentatively.
harding said, "he's on fairly high doses of morphine."
"not high enough, i can tell you," malcolm said. "christ, he's stingy with his drugs. did they find

al would just shake him, and then toss him."
"i'm afraid that's right," malcolm said. "i doubt i'd have survived, except the big chap's heart
wasn't in it. to tell the truth, he struck me as a rather clumsy attacker of anything less than an
automobile or a small apartment building."
"you think he attacked halfheartedly?"
"it pains me to say it," malcolm said, "but i don't honestly feel i had his full attention. he had
mine, of course. but, then, he weighs eight tons. i don't. "
gennaro turned to harding and said, "they're going to repair the fences now. arnold says
muldoon will need your help herding animals."
"okay," harding said.
"so long as you leave me dr. sattler, and ample morphine," malcolm said. "and so long as we

"what's a malcolm effect?" gennaro said.
"modesty forbids me," malcolm said, "from telling you the details of a phenomenon named after
me." he sighed again, and closed his eyes. in a moment, he was sleeping.

faint. you see it? it looks like the lights of a car, but it is not moving."
muldoon squinted. it probably was just a maintenance light. after all, power was back on.
"we'll worry about it later," he said. "right now let's just get that tree off the fence."
arnold was in an expansive mood. the park was almost back in order. muldoon was repairing the
fences. hammond had gone off to supervise the transfer of the animals with harding. although
he was tired, arnold was feeling good; he was even in a mood to indulge the lawyer, gennaro.
"the malcolm effect?" arnold said. "you worried about that?"
"i'm just curious," gennaro said.
"you mean you want me to tell you why ian malcolm is wrong?"
"sure."
arnold lit another cigarette. "it's technical."
"try me."
"okay," arnold said. "chaos theory describes nonlinear systems. it's now become a very broad
theory that's been used to study everything from the stock market, to rioting cro

"careful! careful!" hammond shouted, as the crane began to lift.
harding grunted and eased the head back onto the leather straps. he didn't want to impede
circulation through the carotid artery. the crane hissed as it lifted the animal into the air, onto the
waiting flatbed truck. the hypsy was a small dryosaur, seven feet long, weighing about five
hundred pounds. she was dark green with mottled brown spots. she was breathing slowly, but
she seemed all right. harding had shot her a few moments before with the tranquilizer gun, and
apparently he had guessed the correct dose. there was always a tense moment dosing these big
animals. too little and they would run off into the forest, collapsing where you couldn't get to
them. too much and they went into terminal cardiac arrest. this one had taken a single bounding
leap and keeled over. perfectly dosed.
"watch it! easy!" hammond was shouting to the workmen.
"mr. hammond," harding said. "please."
"well, they sho

uld be careful-"
"they are being careful," harding said. he climbed up onto the back of the flatbed as the hypsy
came down, and he set her into the restraining harness. harding slipped on the cardiogram collar
that monitored heartbeat, then picked up the big electronic thermometer the size of a turkey
baster and slipped it into the rectum. it beeped: 96.2 degrees.
"how is she?" hammond asked fretfully.
"she's fine," harding said. "she's only dropped a degree and a half."
"that's too much," hammond said. "too deep."
"you don't want her waking up and jumping off the truck," harding snapped.
before coming to the park, harding had been the chief of veterinary medicine at the san diego
zoo, and the world's leading expert on avian care. he flew all over the world, consulting with zoos
in europe, india, and japan on the care of exotic birds. he'd had no interest when this peculiar
little man showed up, offering him a pos

ition in a private game park. but when he learned what
hammond had done ... it was impossible to pass up. harding had an academic bent, and the
prospect of writing the first textbook of veterinary internal medicine: diseases of dinosauria was
compelling. in the late twentieth century, veterinary medicine was scientifically advanced- the
best zoos ran clinics little different from hospitals. new textbooks were merely refinements of old.
for a world-class practitioner, there were no worlds left to conquer. but to be the first to care for a
whole new class of animals: that was something!
and harding had never

these animals. and he didn't want to hear from hammond now.
the hypsy snorted and twitched. she was still breathing shallowly; there was no ocular reflex
yet. but it was time to get moving. "all aboard," harding shouted. "let's get this girl back to her
paddock."
"living systems," arnold said, "are not like mechanical systems. living systems are never in
equilibrium. they are inherently unstable. they may seem stable, but they're not. everything is
moving and changing. in a sense, everything is on the edge of collapse."
gennaro was frowning. "but lots of things don't change; body temperature doesn't change, all
kinds of other-"
"body temperature changes constantly," arnold said. "constantly. it changes

alcolm never understood that."
"are you sure he didn't understand that? he seems pretty clear on the difference between
living and nonliving-"
"look," arnold said. "the proof is right here." he pointed to the screens.
"in less than an hour," he said, "the park will all be back on line. the only thing i've got left to
clear is the telephones. for some reason, they're still out. but everything else will be working.
and that's not theoretical. that's a fact."
the needle went deep into the neck, and harding injected the medrine into the anesthetized
female dryosaur as she lay on her side on the ground. immediately the animal began to recover,
snorting and kicking her powerful hind legs.
"back, everybody," harding said, scrambling away. "get back."
the dinosaur staggered to her feet, standing drunkenly. she shook her lizard head, stared at
the people standing back in the quartz lights, and blinked.
"she's drooling," hammond said, worried.
"temporary," harding said. "it'll stop."

d, and then moved slowly across the field, away from the lights.
"why isn't she hopping?"
"she will," harding said. "it'll take her about an hour to recover fully. she's fine." he turned
back to the car. "okay, boys, let's go deal with the stego."
muldoon watched as the last of the stakes was pounded into the ground. the lines were pulled
taut, and the protocarpus tree was lifted clear. muldoon could see the blackened, charred streaks
on the silver fence where the short had occurred. at the base of the fence, several ceramic
insulators had burst. they would have to be replaced. but before that could be

 work crew were there. 
"huh," arnold said. "looks like the rex went into the sauropod paddock."
muldoon said, "fine dining tonight."
"we'll have to get him out of there," arnold said.
"with what?" muldoon said. "we haven't got anything to use on a rex. i'll fix this fence, but i'm
not going in there until daylight."
"hammond won't like it."
"we'll discuss it when i get back," muldoon said.
"how many sauropods will the rex kill?" hammond said, pacing around the control room.
"probably just one," harding said. "sauropods are big; the rex can feed off a single kill for
several days."
"we have to go out and get him tonight," hammond said.
muldoon shook his head. "i'm not going in there until daylight."
hammond was rising up and down on the balls of his feet, the way he did whenever he was
angry. "are you forgetting you work for me?"
"no, mr. hammond, i'm not forgetting. but that's a full-grown adult tyrannosaur out there. how
do you plan to get him?"
"we have tranquilizer guns."

ldoon felt a wrenching pain in his ankle, tumbled down an embankment, and hit the ground
running. looking back, he saw gennaro running in the other direction, into the forest. the raptors
were ignoring gennaro but pursuing muldoon. they were now less than twenty yards away.
muldoon screamed at the top of his lungs as he ran, wondering vaguely where the hell he could
go. because he knew he had perhaps ten seconds before they got him.
ten seconds. maybe
less.
ellie had to help malcolm turn over as harding jabbed the needle and injected morphine. malcolm
sighed and collapsed back. it seemed be was growing weaker by the minute. over the radio, they
heard tinny screaming, and muffled explosions coming from the visitor center.
hammond came into the room and said, "how is he?"
"he's holding," harding said. "a bit delirious."
"i am nothing of the sort," malcolm said. "i am utterly clear." they listened to the radio. "it
sounds like a war out there."

"who's going to be the bait? i'm no good. my ankle's shot." "i'll

"no," muldoon said. "you're the only one who knows what to do about the computer. you need
to talk grant through the start-up."
"then i'll do it," harding said.

"it'll make him nervous."
the lobby was quiet, chilly fog drifting past them. the radio had been silent for several minutes.

"still outside."
"better get her in. the raptors have left the skylight." 
"when?" wu said, moving to the door.
"just a moment ago," harding said.
wu threw open the front door. "ellie! inside, now!"
she looked over at him, puzzled. "there's no problem, everything's under control. . . ."
"now!"
she shook her head. "i know what i'm doing," she said.
"now, ellie, damn it!"
muldoon didn't like wu standing there with the door open, and he was about to say so, when
he saw a shadow descend from above, and he realized at once what had happened. wu was
yanked bodily out the door, and muldoon heard ellie screaming. muldoon got to the door and

and with a stinging shock, she felt herself enveloped in coldness. she was underwater. she
had done it! she came to the surface and looked up at the roof, and saw the raptors looking
down at her. and she knew that, if she could do it, the raptors could do it, too. she splashed in
the water and thought, can raptors swim? but she was sure they could. they could probably
swim like crocodiles.
the raptors turned away from the edge of the roof. and then she heard harding calling
"sattler?" and she realized he had opened the roof door. the raptors were going toward him.
hurriedly, she climbed out of the pool and ran toward the lodge.
harding had gone up the steps to the roof two at a time, and he had flung open the door without
thinking. "sattler!" he shouted. and then he stopped. mist blew among the pyramids on the roof.
the raptors were not in sight.
"sattler!"
he was so preoccupied with sattler that it was a moment before he realized his mistake. he

 able to see the animals, he thought. in the next instant the clawed forearm smashed
around the side of the door, catching him in the chest with a tearing pain, and it took all of his
effort to pull himself backward and close the door on the arm, and from downstairs he heard
muldoon sbouting, "she's here, she's already inside."
from the other side of the door, the raptor snarled, and harding slammed the door again, and
the claws pulled back, and he closed the door with a metallic clang and sank coughing to the
floor.
"where are we going?" lex said. they were on the second floor of the visitor center. a glasswalled
corridor ran the length of the building.
"to the control room , tim said.
"where's that?"

them. these seemed to be offices: park warden guest services . . . general

ammond with anxiety and dread.
and, paradoxically, hammond found it all much worse because he disliked the mathematician
so much. it was worse than if the man were his friend. hammond felt that malcolm's death,
should it occur, would be the final rebuke, and that was more than hammond could bear.
in any case, the smell in the room was quite ghastly. quite ghastly. the rotten decay of human
flesh.
"everything . . . parad . . ." malcolm said, tossing on the pillow. "is
he waking up?" hammond said. harding shook his head.
"what did he say? something about paradise?" "i
didn't catch it," harding said.
hammond paced some more. he pushed the window wider, trying to get some fresh air.
finally, when he couldn't stand it, he said, "is there any problem about going outside?"
"i don't think so, no," harding said. "i think this area is all right."
"well, look, i'm going outside for a bit."
"all right," harding said. he adjusted the flow on the intravenous antibiotics.
"i'll be back soon."
"all right."

mmond left, stepping out into the daylight, wondering why he had bothered to justify himself
to harding. after all, the man was his employee. hammond had no need to explain himself.
he went through the gates of the fence, looking around the park. it was late afternoon, the time
when the blowing mist was thinned, and the sun sometimes came out. the sun was out now, and
hammond took it as an omen. say what they would, he knew that his park had promise. and
even if that impetuous fool gennaro decided to burn it to the ground, it would not make much
difference.

park, where children pressed against the fences, wondering at the extraordinary creatures, come
alive from their storybooks. real vision. the ability to see the future. the ability to marshal
resources to make that future vision a reality.
no, neither wu nor arnold was suited to that task.
and, for that matter, ed regis had been a poor choice, too. harding was at best an indifferent
choice. muldoon was a drunk.. . .
hammond shook his head. he would do better next time.
lost in his thoughts, he headed toward his bungalow, following the little path that ran north
from the visitor center. he passed one of the workmen, who nodded curtly. hammond did not
return the nod. he found the tican workmen to be uniformly insolent. to tell the truth, the choice
of this island off costa rica had also been unwise. he would not make such obvious mistakes

e visitor center. hammond sat down in the damp
earth, listening to the sounds in the jungle around him. and then, after a while, he began to shout
for help.
malcolm's voice was no louder than a whisper. "everything looks different . . . on the other side,"
he said.
harding leaned close to him. "on the other side?" he thought that malcolm was talking about
dying.
"when . . . shifts," malcolm said.
"shifts?"
malcolm didn't answer. his dry lips moved. "paradigm," he said finally.
"paradigm shifts?" harding said. he knew about paradigm shifts. for the last two decades,
they had been the fashionable way to talk about scientific change. "paradigm" was just another
word for a model, but as scientists used it the term meant something more, a world view. a larger
way of seeing the world. paradigm shifts were said to occur whenever science made a major
change in its view of the world. such changes were relatively rare, occurring about once a
century, darwinian evolution had forced a paradigm shift. quan

harding sighed. despite all efforts, malcolm was rapidly slipping into a terminal delirium. his
fever was higher, and they were almost out of his antibiotics.

"anything," malcolm said. "because . . . everything looks different . . . on the other side."

the officer went on to gennaro, and asked the same question: "are you in charge?"
"no," gennaro said.
the officer looked at ellie, but said nothing to her. the door was left open as the helicopter
lifted away from the beach, and grant leaned out to see if he could catch a last look at the
raptors, but then the helicopter was above the palm trees, moving north over the island.
grant leaned to muldoon, and shouted: "what about the others?"
muldoon shouted, "they've already taken off harding and some workmen. hammond had an
accident. found him on the hill near his bungalow. must have fallen."
"is he all right?" grant said.
"no. compys got him."
"what about malcolm?" grant said.
muldoon shook his head.
grant was too tired to feel much of anything. he turned away, and looked back out the door. it
