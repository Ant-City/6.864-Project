f the gods of the class, he reported
for freshman football practice, but in the second week, playing
quarter-back, already paragraphed in corners of the princetonian, he
wrenched his knee seriously enough to put him out for the rest of the
season. this forced him to retire and consider the situation.

â€œ12 univeeâ€ housed a dozen miscellaneous question-marks. there were
three or four inconspicuous and quite startled boys from lawrenceville,
two amateur wild men from a new york private school (kerry holiday
christened them the â€œplebeian drunksâ€), a jewish youth, also from new
york, and, as compensation for amory, the two holidays, to whom he took
an instant fancy.

the holidays were rumored twins, but really the dark-haired one, kerry,
was a year older than his blond brother, burne. kerry was tall, with
humorous gray eyes, and a sudden, attractive smile; he became at once
the mentor of the house, reaper of ears that grew too high, censor of
conceit, vendor of rare, satirical humor. amory sprea

â€œsleep!â€

â€œwhy not? iâ€™ve got a class at eleven-thirty.â€

â€œyou damned gloom! of course, if you donâ€™t want to go to the coast--â€

with a bound amory was out of bed, scattering the bureau coverâ€™s burden
on the floor. the coast... he hadnâ€™t seen it for years, since he and his
mother were on their pilgrimage.

â€œwhoâ€™s going?â€ he demanded as he wriggled into his b. v. d.â€™s.

â€œoh, dick humbird and kerry holiday and jesse ferrenby and--oh about
five or six. speed it up, kid!â€

in ten minutes amory was devouring cornflakes in renwickâ€™s, and at
nine-thirty they bowled happily out of town, headed for the sands of
deal beach.

â€œyou see,â€ said kerry, â€œthe car belongs down there. in fact, it was
stolen from asbury park by persons unknown, who deserted it in princeton
and left for the west. heartless humbird here got permission from the
city council to deliver it.â€

â€œanybody got any money?â€ su

amory talked; he went thoroughly into the destruction of his egotistic
highways, and in a half-hour the listless quality had left his voice.

â€œwhat would you do if you left college?â€ asked monsignor.

â€œdonâ€™t know. iâ€™d like to travel, but of course this tiresome war
prevents that. anyways, mother would hate not having me graduate. iâ€™m
just at sea. kerry holiday wants me to go over with him and join the
lafayette esquadrille.â€

â€œyou know you wouldnâ€™t like to go.â€

â€œsometimes i would--to-night iâ€™d go in a second.â€

â€œwell, youâ€™d have to be very much more tired of life than i think you
are. i know you.â€

â€œiâ€™m afraid you do,â€ agreed amory reluctantly. â€œit just seemed an easy
way out of everything--when i think of another useless, draggy year.â€

â€œyes, i know; but to tell you the truth, iâ€™m not worried about you; you

    that conscious tolerance of yours,
    that broad and beaming view of truth

in april, kerry holiday left college and sailed for france to enroll in
the lafayette esquadrille. amoryâ€™s envy and admiration of this step
was drowned in an experience of his own to which he never succeeded in
giving an appropriate value, but which, nevertheless, haunted him for
three years afterward.
