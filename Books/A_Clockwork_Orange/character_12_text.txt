 no more of them singing ptitsas in here.” then he gave his old dim guff, a clowny big hohohohoho. it seemed like he was too dim to take much offence.

so off we went our several ways, me belching arrrrgh on the cold coke i’d peeted. i had my cut-throat britva handy in case any of billyboy’s droogs should be around near the flat-block waiting, or for that matter any of the other bandas or gruppas or shaikas that from time to time were at war with one. where i lived was with my dadda and mum in the flats of municipal flatblock 18a, between kingsley avenue and wilsonsway. i got to the big main door with no trouble, though i did pass one young malchick sprawling and creeching and moaning in the gutter, all cut about lovely, and saw in the lamplight also streaks of blood here and there like signatures, my brothers, of the night’s fillying. and too i saw just by 18a a pair of devotchka’s neezhnies doubtless rudely wrenched off in the heat of the moment, o my brothers. and so in. in

 the ten floors up. i cursed and panted climbing, being tired in plott if not so much in brain. i wanted music very bad this evening, that singing devotchka in the korova having perhaps started me off. i wanted like a big feast of it before getting my passport stamped, my brothers, at sleep’s frontier and the stripy shest lifted to let me through.

i opened the door of 10-8 with my own little klootch, and inside our malenky quarters all was quiet, the pee and em both being in sleepland, and mum had laid out on the table on malenky bit of supper—a couple of lomticks of tinned sponge-meat with a shive or so of kleb and butter, a glass of the old cold moloko. hohoho, the old moloko, with no knives or synthemesc or drencrom in it. how wicked, my brothers, innocent milk must always seem to me now. still i drank and ate growling, being more hungry than i thought at first, and i got fruit-pie from the larder and tore chunks off it to stuff into my greedy rot. then i tooth-cleaned and click

 the bed, an hour or two say, and then get dressed nice and easy, perhaps even having a splosh about in the bath, make toast for myself and slooshy the radio or read the gazetta, all on my oddy knocky. and then in the afterlunch i might perhaps, if i still felt like it, itty off to the old skolliwoll and see what was vareeting in the great seat of gloopy useless learning, o my brothers. i heard my papapa grumbling and trampling and then ittying off to the dyeworks where he rabbited, and then my mum called in in a very respectful goloss as she did now i was growing up big and strong:

“it’s gone eight, son. you don’t want to be late again.”

so i called back: “a bit of pain in my gulliver. leave us be and i’ll try to sleep it off and then i’ll be right as dodgers for this after.” i slooshied her give a sort of a sigh and she said:

“i’ll put your breakfast in the oven then, son. i’ve got to be off myself now.” which was true, there being this law for everybody

 not a child nor with child nor ill to go out rabbiting. my mum worked at one of the statemarts, as they called them, filling up the shelves with tinned soup and beans and all that cal. so i slooshied her clank a plate in the gas-oven like and then she was putting her shoes on and then getting her coat from behind the door and then sighing again, then she said: “i’m off now, son.” but i let on to be back in sleepland and then i did doze off real horrorshow, and i had a queer and very real like sneety, dreaming for some reason of my droog georgie. in t

 government and the judges and the schools cannot allow the bad because they cannot allow the self. and is not our modern history, my brothers, the story of brave malenky selves fighting these big machines? i am serious with you, brothers, over this. but what i do i do because i like to do.

so now, this smiling winter morning, i drink this very strong chai with moloko and spoon after spoon after spoon of sugar, me having a sladky tooth, and i dragged out of the oven the breakfast my poor old mum had cooked for me. it was an egg fried, that and no more, but i made toast and ate egg and toast and jam, smacking away at it while i read the gazetta. the gazetta was the usual about ultra-violence and bank robberies and strikes and footballers making everybody paralytic with fright by threatening to not play next saturday if they did not get higher wages, naughty malchickiwicks as they were. also there were more space-trips and bigger stereo tv screens and offers of free packets of soapflakes

r to the slooshying in the living-room and, from the clink clink of plates and slurp slurp of peeting tea from cups, at their tired meal after the day’s rabbiting in factory the one, store the other. the poor old. the pitiable starry. i put on my over-gown and looked out, in guise of loving only son, to say:

“hi hi hi, there. a lot better after the day’s rest. ready now for evening work to earn that little bit.” for that’s what they said they believed i did these days. “yum, yum, mum. any of that for me?” it was like some frozen pie that she’d unfroze and then warmed up and it looked not so very appetitish, but i had to say what i said. dad looked at me with a not-so-pleased suspicious like look but said nothing, knowing he dared not, and mum gave me a tired like little smeck, to thee fruit of my womb my only son sort of. i danced to the bathroom and had a real skorry cheest all over, feeling dirty and gluey, then back to my den for the evening’s platties. then, shini

ng, combed, brushed and gorgeous, i sat to my lomtick of pie. papapa said:

“not that i want to pry, son, but where exactly is it you go to work of evenings?”

“oh,” i chewed, “it’s mostly odd things, helping like. here and there, as it might be.” i gave him a straight dirty glazzy, as to say to mind his own and i’d mind mine. “i never ask for money, do i? not money for clothes or for pleasures? all right, then, why ask?”

my dad was like humble mumble chumble. “sorry, son,” he said. “but i get worried sometimes. sometimes i have dreams. you can laugh if you like, but there’s a lot in dreams. last night i had this dream with you in it and i didn’t like it one bit.”

“oh?” he had gotten me interessovatted now, dreaming of me like that. i had like a feeling i had had a dream, too, but i could not remember proper what. “yes?” i said, stopping chewing my gluey pie.

“it was vivid,” said my dad. “i saw you lying on

“and,” said my dad, “you were like helpless in your blood and you couldn’t fight back.” that was real opposites, so i had another quiet malenky grin within and then i took all the deng out of my carmans and tinkled it on the saucy table-cloth. i said:

“here, dad, it’s not much. it’s what i earned last night. but perhaps for the odd peet of scotchman in the snug somewhere for you and mum.”

“thanks, son,” he said. “but we don’t go out much now. we daren’t go out much, the streets being what they are. young hooligans and so on. still, thanks. i’ll bring her home a bottle of something tomorrow.” and he scooped this ill-gotten pretty into his trouser carmans, mum being at the cheesting of the dishes in the kitchen. and i went out with loving smiles all round.

when i got to the bottom of the stairs of the flatblock i was somewhat surprised. i was more than that

i take it up now, and this is the real weepy and like tragic part of the story beginning, my brothers and only friends, in staja (state jail, that is) number 84f. you will have little desire to slooshy all the cally and horrible raskazz of the shock that sent my dad beating his bruised and krovvy rockers against unfair like bog in his heaven, and my mum squaring her rot for owwwww owwwww owwwww in her mother’s grief at her only child and son of her bosom like letting everybody down real horrorshow. then there was the starry very grim magistrate in the lower court govoreeting some very hard slovos against your friend and humble narrator, after all the cally and grahzny slander spat forth by p. r. deltoid and the rozzes, bog blast them. then there was being remanded in filthy custody among vonny perverts and prestoopnicks. then there was the t

rial in the higher court with judges and a jury, and some very very nasty slovos indeed govoreeted in a very like solemn way, and then guilty and my mum boohoohooing when they said fourteen years, o my brothers. so here i was now, two years just to the day of being kicked and clanged into staja 84f, dressed in the heighth of prison fashion, which was a one-piece suit of a very filthy like cal colour, and the number sewn on the groody part just above the old tick-tocker and on the back as well, so that going and coming i was 6655321 and not your little droog alex not no longer.

 had been doing a bit of boasting, looking forward to a nice crime-free era in which there would be no more fear of cowardly attacks from young hooligans and perverts and burglars and all that cal. so i went arghhhhhh and threw this gazetta on the floor, so that it covered up stains of spilled chai and horrible spat gobs from the cally animals that used thus caff.

“what’s it going to be then, eh?”

what it was going to be now, brothers, was homeways and a nice surprise for dadada and mum, their only son and heir back in the family bosom. then i could lay back on the bed in my own malenky den and slooshy some lovely music, and at the same time i could think over what to do now with my jeezny. the discharge officer had given me a long list the day before of jobs i could try for, and he had telephoned to different vecks about me, but i had no intention, my brothers, of going off to rabbit right away. a malenky bit of a rest first, yes, and a quiet think on the bed to the sound of

oking at me, and it was pee and em having their breakfast, but it was also another veck that i had never viddied in my jeezny before, a bolshy thick veck in his shirt and braces, quite at home, brothers, slurping away at the milky chai and munchmunching at his eggiweg and toast. and it was this stranger veck who spoke first, saying:

“who are you, friend? where did you get hold of a key? out, before i push your face in. get out there and knock. explain your business, quick.”

my dad and mum sat like petrified, and i could viddy they had not yet read the gazetta, then i remembered that the gazetta did not arrive till papapa had gone off to his work. but then mum said: “oh, you’ve broken out. you’ve escaped. whatever shall we do? we shall have the police here, oh oh oh. oh, you bad and wicked boy, disgracing us all like this.” and, believe it or kiss my sharries, she started to go boo hoo. so i started to try and explain, they could ring up the staja if they wanted, and all

he sat now with his rot open at me, not govoreeting one single slovo. then my dad said:

“this is all a bit bewildering, son. you should have let us know you were coming. we thought it would be at least another five or six years before they let you out. not,” he said, and he said it very like gloomy, “that we’re not very pleased to see you again and a free man, too.”

“who is this?” i said. “why can’t he speak up? what’s going on in here?”

“this is joe,” said my mum. “he lives here now. the lodger, that’s what he is. oh, dear dear dear,” she went.

“you,” said this joe. “i’ve heard all about you, boy. i know what you’ve done, breaking the hearts of your poor grieving parents. so you’re back, eh? back to make life a misery for them once more, is that it? over my dead corpse you will, because they’ve let me be more like a son to them than like a lodger.” i could nearly have smecked loud at that if the old razdraz within me hadn’t st

“so,” i said, and i near felt like collapsing in all tears myself. “so that’s it, then. well, i give you five large minootas to clear all your horrible cally veshches out of my room.” and i made for this room, this veck being a malenky bit too slow to stop me. when i opened the door my heart cracked to the carpet, because i viddied it was no longer like my room at all, brothers. all my flags had gone off the walls and this veck had put up pictures of boxers, also li

i had to sit down then, and this joe said: “ask permission before you sit, you mannerless young swine,” so i cracked back skorry with a “shut your dirty big fat hole, you,” feeling sick. then i tried to be all reasonable and smiling for my health’s sake like, so i said: “well, that’s my room, there’s no denying that. this is my home also. what suggestions have you, my pee and em, to make?” but they just looked very glum, my mum shaking a bit, her litso all lines and wet with like tears, and then my dad said:

“all this needs thinking about, son. we can’t very well just kick joe out, not just like that, can we? i mean, joe’s here doing a job, a contract it is, two years, and we made like an arrangement, didn’t we, joe? i mean son, thinking you were going to stay in prison a long time and that room going begging.” he was a bit ashamed, you could viddy that from his litso. so i just smiled and like nodded, sa

e future we can’t say to joe to get out, can we, joe?” this joe said:

“it’s you two i’ve got to think of, who’ve been like a father and mother to me. would it be right or fair to go off and leave you to the tender mercies of this young monster who has been like no real son at all? he’s weeping now, but that’s his craft and artfulness. let him go off and find a room somewhere. let him learn the error of his ways and that a bad boy like he’s been doesn’t deserve such a good mum and dad as what he’s had.”

“all right,” i said, standing up in all like tears still. “i know how things are now. nobody wants or loves me. i’ve suffered and suffered and suffered and everybody wants me to go on suffering. i know.”

“you’ve made others suffer,” said this joe. “it’s only right you should suffer proper. i’ve been told everything that you’ve done, sitting here at night round the family table, and pretty shocking it was to listen to. made me real sic

“i wish,” i said, “i was back in the prison. dear old staja as it was. i’m ittying off now,” i said. “you won’t ever viddy me no more. i’ll make my own way, thank you very much. let it lie heavy on your consciences.” my dad said:

“don’t take it like that, son,” and my mum just went boo hoo hoo, her litso all screwed up real ugly, and this joe put his rooker round her again, patting her and going there there there like bezoomny. and so i just sort of staggered to the door and went out, leaving them to their horrible guilt, o my brothers.

y pee and em come to viddy their ill son, my em boohooing real horrorshow. i could govoreet a lot better now and could say: “well well well well well, what gives? what makes you think you are like welcome?” my papapa said, in a like ashamed way:

“you were in the papers, son. it said they had done great wrong to you. it said how the government drove you to try and do yourself in. and it was our fault too, in a way, son. your home’s your home, when all’s said and done, son.” and my mum kept on going boohoohoo and looking ugly as kiss-my-sharries. so i said:

“and how beeth the new son joe? well and healthy and prosperous, i trust and pray?” my mum said:

“oh, alex alex. owwwwwwww.” my papapa said:

“a very awkward thing, son. he got into a bit of trouble with the police and was done by the police.”

“really?” i said. “really? such a good sort of chelloveck and all. amazed proper i am, honest.”

“minding his own business he was,” said my pee.

“and the police told him to move on. waiting at a corner he was, son, to see a girl he was going to meet. and they told him to move on and he said he had rights like everybody else, and then they sort of fell on top of him and hit him about cruel.”

“terrible,” i said. “really terrible. and where is the poor boy now?”

“owwwww,” boohooed my mum. “gone back owwwwwwme.”

“yes,” said dad. “he’s gone back to his own home town to get better. they’ve had to give his job here to somebody else.”

“so now,” i said, “you’re willing for me to move back in again and things be like they were before.”

“yes, son,” said my papapa. “please, son.”

“i’ll consider it,” i said. “i’ll think about it real careful.”

“owwwww,” went my mum.

“ah, shut it,” i said, “or i’ll give you someth

“that’s no way to speak to your mother, son,” said my papapa. “after all, she brought you into the world.”

“yes,” i said. “and a right grahzny vonny world too.” i shut my glazzies tight in like pain and said: “go away now. i’ll think about coming back. but things will have to be very different.”

“yes, son,” said my pee. “anything you say.”

“you’ll have to make up your mind,” i said, “who’s to be boss.”

“owwwwww,” my mum went on.

“very good, son,” said my papapa. “things will be as you like. only get well.”

when they had gone i laid and thought a bit about different veshches, like all different pictures passing through my gulliver, and when the nurse ptitsa came back in and like straightened the sheets on the bed i said to her:

“how long is it i’ve been in here?”

“a week or so,” she said.

“and what have they been doing to me?”
