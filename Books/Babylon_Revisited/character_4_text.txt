ant honoria.

lincoln spoke first: "we've been talking it over ever since we got your letter last month. we're happy to have honoria here. she's a dear little thing, and we're glad to be able to help her, but of course that isn't the question--"

marion interrupted suddenly. "how long are you going to stay sober, charlie?" she asked.

"permanently, i hope."

"how can anybody count on that?"

"you know i never did drink heavily until i gave up business and came over here with nothing to do. then helen and i began to run around with--"

"please leave helen out of it. i can't bear to hear you talk about her like that."

he stared at her grimly; he had never been certain how fond of each other the sisters were in life.

"my drinking only lasted about a year and a half--from the time we came over until i--collapsed."

"it was time enough."

"it was time enough," he agreed.

"my duty is entirely to helen," she said. "i try to think what she would have wanted me to do. frankly, from the night you

did that terrible thing you haven't really existed for me. i can't help that. she was my sister."

"yes."

"when she was dying she asked me to look out for honoria. if you hadn't been in a sanitarium then, it might have helped matters."

he had no answer.

"i'll never in my life be able to forget the morning when helen knocked at my door, soaked to the skin and shivering, and said you'd locked her out."

charlie gripped the sides of the chair. this was more difficult than he expected; he wanted to launch out into a long expostulation and explanation, but he only said: "the night i locked her out--" and she interrupted, "i don't feel up to going over that again."

after a moment's silence lincoln said: "we're getting off the subject. you want marion to set aside her legal guardianship and give you honoria. i t

ce in you or not."

"i don't blame marion," charlie said slowly, "but i think she can have entire confidence in me. i had a good record up to three years ago. of course, it's within human possibilities i might go wrong any time. but if we wait much longer i'll lose honoria's childhood and my chance for a home." he shook his head, "i'll simply lose her, don't you see?"

"yes, i see," said lincoln.

"why didn't you think of all this before?" marion asked.

"i suppose i did, from time to time, but helen and i were getting along badly. when i consented to the guardianship, i was flat on my back in a sanitarium and the market had cleaned me out. i knew i'd acted badly, and i thought if it would bring any peace to helen, i'd agree to anything. but now it's different. i'm functioning, i'm behaving damn well, so far as--"

"please don't swear at me," marion said.

he looked at her, startled. with each remark the force of her dislike became more and more apparent. she had built up all her fear of li

alness of his desire; but she had lived for a long time with a prejudice--a prejudice founded on a curious disbelief in her sister's happiness, and which, in the shock of one terrible night, had turned to hatred for him. it had all happened at a point in her life where the discouragement of ill health and adverse circumstances made it necessary for her to believe in tangible villainy and a tangible villain.

"i can't help what i think!" she cried out suddenly. "how much you were responsible for helen's death, i don't know. it's something you'll have to square with your own conscience."

an electric current of agony surged through him; for a moment he was almost on his feet, an unuttered sound echoing in his throat. he hung on to himself for a moment, another moment.

"hold on there," said lincoln uncomfortably. "i never thought you were responsible for that."

"helen died of heart trouble," charlie said dully.

"yes, heart trouble." marion spoke as if the phrase had another meaning for her.

her head."

"of course."

"it's going to be all right. i think she sees now that you--can provide for the child, and so we can't very well stand in your way or honoria's way."

"thank you, lincoln."

"i'd better go along and see how she is."

"i'm going."

he was still trembling when he reached the street, but a walk down the rue bonaparte to the quais set him up, and as he crossed the seine, fresh and new by the quai lamps, he felt exultant. but back in his room he couldn't sleep. the image of helen haunted him. helen whom he had loved so until they had senselessly begun to abuse each other's love, tear it into shreds. on that terrible february night that marion remembered so vividly, a slow quarrel had gone on for hours. there was a scene at the florida, and then he attempted to take her home, and then she kissed young webb at a table; after that there was what she had hysterically said. when he arrived home alone he turned the key in the lock in wild anger. how could he know she would ar

rive an hour later alone, that there would be a snowstorm in which she wandered about in slippers, too confused to find a taxi? then the aftermath, her escaping pneumonia by a miracle, and all the attendant horror. they were "reconciled," but that was the beginning of the end, and marion, who had seen with her own eyes and who imagined it to be one of many scenes from her sister's martyrdom, never forgot.

going over it again brought helen nearer, and in the white, soft light that steals upon half sleep near morning he found himself talking to her again. she said that he was perfectly right about honoria and that she wanted honoria to be with him. she said she was glad he was being good and doing better. she said a lot of other things--very friendly things--but she was in a swing in a white dress, and swinging faster and faster all the time, so that at the end he could not hear clearly all that she said.

ling happy. the door of the world was open again. he made plans, vistas, futures for honoria and himself, but suddenly he grew sad, remembering all the plans he and helen had made. she had not planned to die. the present was the thing--work to do and someone to love. but not to love too much, for he knew the injury that a father can do to a daughter or a mother to a son by attaching them too closely: afterward, out in the world, the child would seek in the marriage partner the same blind tenderness and, failing probably to find it, turn against love and life.

it was another bright, crisp day. he called lincoln peters at the bank where he worked and asked if he

 and talked to a cross béarnaise and to a buxom breton peasant, neither of whom he could have endured. there were others whom he would see tomorrow.

he lunched with lincoln peters at griffons, trying to keep down his exultation.

"there's nothing quite like your own child," lincoln said. "but you understand how marion feels too."

"she's forgotten how hard i worked for seven years there," charlie said. "she just remembers one night."

"there's another thing." lincoln hesitated. "while you and helen were tearing around europe throwing money away, we were just getting along. i didn't touch any of the prosperity because i never got ahead enough to carry anything but my insurance. i think marion felt there was some kind of injustice in it--you not even working toward the end, and getting richer and richer."

"it went just as quick as it came," said charlie.

"yes, a lot of it stayed in the hands of chasseurs and saxophone players and maîtres d'hôtel--well, the big party's over now. i just s

lorraine.     

 

his first feeling was one of awe that he had actually, in his mature years, stolen a tricycle and pedalled lorraine all over the étoile between the small hours and dawn. in retrospect it was a nightmare. locking out helen didn't fit in with any other act of his life, but the tricycle incident did--it was one of many. how many weeks or months of dissipation to arrive at that condition of utter irresponsibility?

he tried to picture how lorraine had appeared to him then--very attractive; helen was unhappy about it, though she said nothing. yesterday, in the restaurant, lorraine had seemed trite, blurred, worn away. he emphatically did not want to see her, and he was glad alix had not given away his hotel address.

crash, but then in the second. your friend george hardt lost every cent, i hear. are you back in the states?"

"no, i'm in business in prague."

"i heard that you lost a lot in the crash."

"i did," and he added grimly, "but i lost everything i wanted in the boom."

"selling short."

"something like that."

again the memory of those days swept over him like a nightmare--the people they had met travelling; then people who couldn't add a row of figures or speak a coherent sentence. the little man helen had consented to dance with at the ship's party, who had insulted her ten feet from the table; the women and girls carried screaming with drink or drugs out of public places--

--the men who locked their wives out in the snow, because the snow of twenty-nine wasn't real snow. if you didn't want it to be snow, you just paid some money.

he went to the phone and called the peters' apartment; lincoln answered.

"i called up because this thing is on my mind. has marion said anything definite?"

"no, no more," he said to another waiter. "what do i owe you?"

he would come back some day; they couldn't make him pay forever. but he wanted his child, and nothing was much good now, beside that fact. he wasn't young any more, with a lot of nice thoughts and dreams to have by himself. he was absolutely sure helen wouldn't have wanted him to be so alone.
