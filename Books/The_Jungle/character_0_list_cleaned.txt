[CHARACTER] - 
                a
lithuanian immigrant who comes to america with his wife, ona. jurgis
is a strong, determined individual with a faith in the american
dream of self-betterment, but his health, family, and hopes are
slowly destroyed by the miserable working and living conditions
in packingtown. jurgis, who doesn't elicit much more from the reader
than pity, is an obvious instrument that sinclair uses to express
his vision of the exploitation of the worker by capitalism and his redemption
by socialism.
