[CHARACTER]
although largely a uniformly evil villain, [CHARACTER]
does possess some psychological depth as a character. he has been
deeply affected by the death of his angelic mother and seems to
show some legitimate affection for cassy. nonetheless, legree's
main purpose in the book is as a foil to uncle tom, and as an effective
picture of slavery at its worst. often associated with firelight
and flames, legree demonstrates literally infernal qualities, and
his devilishness provides an effective contrast with the angelic
qualities of his passive slave. legree's demoniacally evil ways
also play an important role in shaping the end of the book along
the lines of the traditional christian narrative. above all, legree
desires to break tom's religious faith and to see him capitulate
to doubt and sin. in the end, although tom dies and legree survives,
the evil that legree stands for has been destroyed. tom dies loving
the men who kill him, proving that his faith prevails over legree's
evil.
