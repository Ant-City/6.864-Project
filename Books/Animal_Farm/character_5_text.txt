pite of the fact that his tushes had never been cut. before long the
other animals began to arrive and make themselves comfortable after their
different fashions. first came the three dogs, bluebell, jessie, and
pincher, and then the pigs, who settled down in the straw immediately in
front of the platform. the hens perched themselves on the window-sills,
the pigeons fluttered up to the rafters, the sheep and cows lay down
behind the pigs and began to chew the cud. the two cart-horses, boxer and
clover, came in together, walking very slowly and setting down their vast
hairy hoofs with great care lest there should be some small animal
concealed in the straw. clover was a stout motherly mare approaching
middle life, who had never quite got her figure back after her fourth foal.
boxer was an enormous beast, nearly eighteen hands high, and as strong as
any two ordinary horses put together. a white stripe down his nose gave
him a somewhat stupid appearance, and in fact he was not of first-rate

never laughed. if asked why, he would say that he saw nothing to laugh at.
nevertheless, without openly admitting it, he was devoted to boxer; the
two of them usually spent their sundays together in the small paddock
beyond the orchard, grazing side by side and never speaking.

the two horses had just lain down when a brood of ducklings, which had
lost their mother, filed into the barn, cheeping feebly and wandering from
side to side to find some place where they would not be trodden on. clover
made a sort of wall round them with her great foreleg, and the ducklings
nestled down inside it and promptly fell asleep. at the last moment
mollie, the foolish, pretty white mare who drew mr. jones's trap, came
mincing daintily in, chewing at a lump of sugar. she took a place near the
front and began flirting her white mane, hoping to draw attention to the
red ribbons it was plaited with. last of all came the cat, who looked
round, as usual, for the warmest place, and finally squeezed herself

between boxer and clover; there she purred contentedly throughout major's
speech without listening to a word of what he was saying.

all the animals were now present except moses, the tame raven, who slept
on a perch behind the back door. when major saw that they had all made
themselves comfortable and were waiting attentively, he cleared his throat
and began:

the pigs had an even harder struggle to counteract the lies put about by
moses, the tame raven. moses, who was mr. jones's especial pet, was a spy
and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker. he claimed to know of
the existence of a mysterious country called sugarcandy mountain, to which
all animals went when they died. it was situated somewhere up in the sky,
a little distance beyond the clouds, moses said. in sugarcandy mountain it
was sunday seven days a week, clover was in season all the year round, and
lump sugar and linseed cake grew on the hedges. the animals hated moses
because he told tales and did no work, but some of them believed in
sugarcandy mountain, and the pigs had to argue very hard to persuade them
that there was no such place.

their most faithful disciples were the two cart-horses, boxer and clover.
these two had great difficulty in thinking anything out for themselves,
but having once accepted the pigs as their teachers, they absorbed

drawback that no animal was
able to use any tool that involved standing on his hind legs. but the pigs
were so clever that they could think of a way round every difficulty. as
for the horses, they knew every inch of the field, and in fact understood
the business of mowing and raking far better than jones and his men had
ever done. the pigs did not actually work, but directed and supervised the
others. with their superior knowledge it was natural that they should
assume the leadership. boxer and clover would harness themselves to the
cutter or the horse-rake (no bits or reins were needed in these days, of
course) and tramp steadily round and round the field with a pig walking
behind and calling out "gee up, comrade!" or "whoa back, comrade!" as the
case might be. and every animal down to the humblest worked at turning the
hay and gathering it. even the ducks and hens toiled to and fro all day in
the sun, carrying tiny wisps of hay in their beaks. in the end they

as for the pigs, they could already read and write perfectly. the dogs
learned to read fairly well, but were not interested in reading anything
except the seven commandments. muriel, the goat, could read somewhat
better than the dogs, and sometimes used to read to the others in the
evenings from scraps of newspaper which she found on the rubbish heap.
benjamin could read as well as any pig, but never exercised his faculty.
so far as he knew, he said, there was nothing worth reading. clover learnt
the whole alphabet, but could not put words together. boxer could not get
beyond the letter d. he would trace out a, b, c, d, in the dust with his
great hoof, and then would stand staring at the letters with his ears
back, sometimes shaking his forelock, trying with all his might to
remember what came next and never succeeding. on several occasions,
indeed, he did learn e, f, g, h, but by the time he knew them, it was
always discovered that he had forgotten a, b, c, and d. finally he dec

common. this was what came of rebelling against the laws of nature,
frederick and pilkington said.

however, these stories were never fully believed. rumours of a wonderful
farm, where the human beings had been turned out and the animals managed
their own affairs, continued to circulate in vague and distorted forms,
and throughout that year a wave of rebelliousness ran through the
countryside. bulls which had always been tractable suddenly turned savage,
sheep broke down hedges and devoured the clover, cows kicked the pail
over, hunters refused their fences and shot their riders on to the other
side. above all, the tune and even the words of 'beasts of england' were
known everywhere. it had spread with astonishing speed. the human beings
could not contain their rage when they heard this song, though they
pretended to think it merely ridiculous. they could not understand, they
said, how even animals could bring themselves to sing such contemptible
rubbish. any animal caught singing it was giv

 troublesome. she was late
for work every morning and excused herself by saying that she had
overslept, and she complained of mysterious pains, although her appetite
was excellent. on every kind of pretext she would run away from work and
go to the drinking pool, where she would stand foolishly gazing at her own
reflection in the water. but there were also rumours of something more
serious. one day, as mollie strolled blithely into the yard, flirting her
long tail and chewing at a stalk of hay, clover took her aside.

"mollie," she said, "i have something very serious to say to you. this
morning i saw you looking over the hedge that divides animal farm from
foxwood. one of mr. pilkington's men was standing on the other side of the
hedge. and--i was a long way away, but i am almost certain i saw this--he
was talking to you and you were allowing him to stroke your nose. what
does that mean, mollie?"

"he didn't! i wasn't! it isn't true!" cried mollie, beginning to prance
about and paw the grou

"mollie! look me in the face. do you give me your word of honour that that
man was not stroking your nose?"

"it isn't true!" repeated mollie, but she could not look clover in the
face, and the next moment she took to her heels and galloped away into the
field.

a thought struck clover. without saying anything to the others, she went
to mollie's stall and turned over the straw with her hoof. hidden under
the straw was a little pile of lump sugar and several bunches of ribbon of
different colours.

three days later mollie disappeared. for some weeks nothing was known of
her whereabouts, then the pigeons reported that they had seen her on the
other side of willingdon. she was between the shafts of a smart dogcart
painted red and black, which was standing outside a public-house.

n achieved without boxer, whose strength seemed equal to
that of all the rest of the animals put together. when the boulder began
to slip and the animals cried out in despair at finding themselves dragged
down the hill, it was always boxer who strained himself against the rope
and brought the boulder to a stop. to see him toiling up the slope inch by
inch, his breath coming fast, the tips of his hoofs clawing at the ground,
and his great sides matted with sweat, filled everyone with admiration.
clover warned him sometimes to be careful not to overstrain himself, but
boxer would never listen to her. his two slogans, "i will work harder"
and "napoleon is always right," seemed to him a sufficient answer to all
problems. he had made arrangements with the cockerel to call him
three-quarters of an hour earlier in the mornings instead of half an hour.
and in his spare moments, of which there were not many nowadays, he would
go alone to the quarry, collect a load of broken stone, and drag it down

dignity of the leader (for of late he had taken to speaking of napoleon
under the title of "leader") to live in a house than in a mere sty.
nevertheless, some of the animals were disturbed when they heard that the
pigs not only took their meals in the kitchen and used the drawing-room
as a recreation room, but also slept in the beds. boxer passed it off as
usual with "napoleon is always right!", but clover, who thought she
remembered a definite ruling against beds, went to the end of the barn and
tried to puzzle out the seven commandments which were inscribed there.
finding herself unable to read more than individual letters, she fetched
muriel.

"muriel," she said, "read me the fourth commandment. does it not say
something about never sleeping in a bed?"

with some difficulty muriel spelt it out.

"it says, 'no animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets,"' she announced
finally.

curiously enough,

clover had not remembered that the fourth commandment
mentioned sheets; but as it was there on the wall, it must have done so.
and squealer, who happened to be passing at this moment, attended by two
or three dogs, was able to put the whole matter in its proper perspective.

"you have heard then, comrades," he said, "that we pigs now sleep in the
beds of the farmhouse? and why not? you did not suppose, surely, that
there was ever a ruling against beds? a bed merely means a place to sleep
in. a pile of

hat this was not the
case. still, it had been decided to build the walls three feet thick this
time instead of eighteen inches as before, which meant collecting much
larger quantities of stone. for a long time the quarry was full of
snowdrifts and nothing could be done. some progress was made in the dry
frosty weather that followed, but it was cruel work, and the animals could
not feel so hopeful about it as they had felt before. they were always
cold, and usually hungry as well. only boxer and clover never lost heart.
squealer made excellent speeches on the joy of service and the dignity of
labour, but the other animals found more inspiration in boxer's strength
and his never-failing cry of "i will work harder!"

in january food fell short. the corn ration was drastically reduced, and
it was announced that an extra potato ration would be issued to make up

, or the cruel retribution they had just
witnessed. in the old days there had often been scenes of bloodshed
equally terrible, but it seemed to all of them that it was far worse now
that it was happening among themselves. since jones had left the farm,
until today, no animal had killed another animal. not even a rat had been
killed. they had made their way on to the little knoll where the
half-finished windmill stood, and with one accord they all lay down as
though huddling together for warmth--clover, muriel, benjamin, the cows,
the sheep, and a whole flock of geese and hens--everyone, indeed, except
the cat, who had suddenly disappeared just before napoleon ordered the
animals to assemble. for some time nobody spoke. only boxer remained on
his feet. he fidgeted to and fro, swishing his long black tail against his
sides and occasionally uttering a little whinny of surprise. finally he
said:

"i do not understand it. i would not have believed that such things could
happen on our farm. it mus

t be due to some fault in ourselves. the
solution, as i see it, is to work harder. from now onwards i shall get up
a full hour earlier in the mornings."

and he moved off at his lumbering trot and made for the quarry. having got
there, he collected two successive loads of stone and dragged them down to
the windmill before retiring for the night.

the animals huddled about clover, not speaking. the knoll where they were
lying gave them a wide prospect across the countryside. most of animal
farm was within their view--the long pasture stretching down to the main
road, the hayfield, the spinney, the drinking pool, the ploughed fields
where the young wheat was thick and green, and the red roofs of the farm
buildings with the smoke curling from the chimneys. it was a clear spring
evening. the grass and the bursting hedges were gilded by the level rays
of the sun. never had

the farm--and with a kind of surprise they
remembered that it was their own farm, every inch of it their own
property--appeared to the animals so desirable a place. as clover looked
down the hillside her eyes filled with tears. if she could have spoken her
thoughts, it would have been to say that this was not what they had aimed
at when they had set themselves years ago to work for the overthrow of the
human race. these scenes of terror and slaughter were not what they had
looked forward to on that night when old major first stirred them to
rebellion. if she herself had had any picture of the future, it had been
of a society of animals set free from hunger and the w

but somehow neither the words nor the tune ever seemed to the animals to
come up to 'beasts of england'.




chapter viii



a few days later, when the terror caused by the executions had died down,
some of the animals remembered--or thought they remembered--that the sixth
commandment decreed "no animal shall kill any other animal." and though no
one cared to mention it in the hearing of the pigs or the dogs, it was
felt that the killings which had taken place did not square with this.
clover asked benjamin to read her the sixth commandment, and when
benjamin, as usual, said that he refused to meddle in such matters, she
fetched muriel. muriel read the commandment for her. it ran: "no animal
shall kill any other animal without cause." somehow or other, the last two
words had slipped out of the animals' memory. but they saw now that the
commandment had not been violated; for clearly there was good reason for
killing the traitors who had leagued themselves with snowball.

himself for the task. but for the first time it occurred to him that he
was eleven years old and that perhaps his great muscles were not quite
what they had once been.

but when the animals saw the green flag flying, and heard the gun firing
again--seven times it was fired in all--and heard the speech that napoleon
made, congratulating them on their conduct, it did seem to them after all
that they had won a great victory. the animals slain in the battle were
given a solemn funeral. boxer and clover pulled the wagon which served as
a hearse, and napoleon himself walked at the head of the procession. two
whole days were given over to celebrations. there were songs, speeches,
and more firing of the gun, and a special gift of an apple was bestowed on
every animal, with two ounces of corn for each bird and three biscuits for
each dog. it was announced that the battle would be called the battle of
the windmill, and that napoleon had created a new decoration, the order
of the green banner, which

boxer's split hoof was a long time in healing. they had started the
rebuilding of the windmill the day after the victory celebrations were
ended. boxer refused to take even a day off work, and made it a point of
honour not to let it be seen that he was in pain. in the evenings he would
admit privately to clover that the hoof troubled him a great deal. clover
treated the hoof with poultices of herbs which she prepared by chewing
them, and both she and benjamin urged boxer to work less hard. "a horse's
lungs do not last for ever," she said to him. but boxer would not listen.
he had, he said, only one real ambition left--to see the windmill well
under way before he reached the age for retirement.

at the beginning, when the laws of animal farm were first formulated,
the retiring age had been fixed for ho

poleon had
commanded that once a week there should be held something called a
spontaneous demonstration, the object of which was to celebrate the
struggles and triumphs of animal farm. at the appointed time the animals
would leave their work and march round the precincts of the farm in
military formation, with the pigs leading, then the horses, then the cows,
then the sheep, and then the poultry. the dogs flanked the procession and
at the head of all marched napoleon's black cockerel. boxer and clover
always carried between them a green banner marked with the hoof and the
horn and the caption, "long live comrade napoleon!" afterwards there were
recitations of poems composed in napoleon's honour, and a speech by
squealer giving particulars of the latest increases in the production of
foodstuffs, and on occasion a shot was fired from the gun. the sheep were
the greatest devotees of the spontaneous demonstration, and if anyone
complained (as a few animals sometimes did, when no pigs or dogs wer

he would perch on a stump, flap his black wings, and talk by the hour to
anyone who would listen. "up there, comrades," he would say solemnly,
pointing to the sky with his large beak--"up there, just on the other side
of that dark cloud that you can see--there it lies, sugarcandy mountain,
that happy country where we poor animals shall rest for ever from our
labours!" he even claimed to have been there on one of his higher flights,
and to have seen the everlasting fields of clover and the linseed cake and
lump sugar growing on the hedges. many of the animals believed him. their
lives now, they reasoned, were hungry and laborious; was it not right and
just that a better world should exist somewhere else? a thing that was
difficult to determine was the attitude of the pigs towards moses. they
all declared contemptuously that his stories about sugarcandy mountain
were lies, and yet they allowed him to remain on the farm, not working,
with an allowance of a gill of beer a da

 shiny than it had used to be, and his great haunches
seemed to have shrunken. the others said, "boxer will pick up when the
spring grass comes on"; but the spring came and boxer grew no fatter.
sometimes on the slope leading to the top of the quarry, when he braced
his muscles against the weight of some vast boulder, it seemed that
nothing kept him on his feet except the will to continue. at such times
his lips were seen to form the words, "i will work harder"; he had no
voice left. once again clover and benjamin warned him to take care of his
health, but boxer paid no attention. his twelfth birthday was approaching.
he did not care what happened so long as a good store of stone was
accumulated before he went on pension.

late one evening in the summer, a sudden rumour ran round the farm that
something had happened to boxer. he had gone out alone to drag a load of
stone down to the windmill. and sure enough, the rumour was true. a few
minutes later two pigeons came racing in with the news; 
 
 ___________________________
 
"boxer has fallen!
he is lying on his side and can't get up!"

about half the animals on the farm rushed out to the knoll where the
windmill stood. there lay boxer, between the shafts of the cart, his neck
stretched out, unable even to raise his head. his eyes were glazed, his
sides matted with sweat. a thin stream of blood had trickled out of his
mouth. clover dropped to her knees at his side.

"boxer!" she cried, "how are you?"

"it is my lung," said boxer in a weak voice. "it does not matter. i think
you will be able to finish the windmill without me. there is a pretty good
store of stone accumulated. i had only another month to go in any case.
to tell you the truth, i had been looking forward to my retirement. and
perhaps, as benjamin is growing old too, they will let him retire at the
same time and be a companion to me."

"we must get help at onc

e," said clover. "run, somebody, and tell squealer
what has happened."

all the other animals immediately raced back to the farmhouse to give
squealer the news. only clover remained, and benjamin who lay down at
boxer's side, and, without speaking, kept the flies off him with his long
tail. after about a quarter of an hour squealer appeared, full of sympathy
and concern. he said that comrade napoleon had learned with the very
deepest distress of this misfortune to one of the most loyal workers on
the farm, and was already making arrangements to send boxer to be treated
in the hospital at willingdon. the animals felt a little uneasy at this.
except for mollie and s
 
 ___________________________
 
nowball, no other animal had ever left the farm,
and they did not like to think of their sick comrade in the hands of human
beings. however, squealer easily convinced them that the veterinary
surgeon in willingdon could treat boxer's case more satisfactorily than
could be done on the farm. and about half an hour later, when boxer had
somewhat recovered, he was with difficulty got on to his feet, and managed
to limp back to his stall, where clover and benjamin had prepared a good
bed of straw for him.

for the next two days boxer remained in his stall. the pigs had sent out a
large bottle of pink medicine which they had found in the medicine chest
in the bathroom, and clover administered it to boxer twice a day after
meals. in the evenings she lay in his stall and talked to him, while
benjamin kept the flies off him. boxer professed not to be sorry for what
had happened. if he made a good recovery, he might expect to live another

ears, and he looked forward to the peaceful days that he would
spend in the corner of the big pasture. it would be the first time that he
had had leisure to study and improve his mind. he intended, he said, to
devote the rest of his life to learning the remaining twenty-two letters
of the alphabet.

however, benjamin and clover could only be with boxer after working hours,
and it was in the middle of the day when the van came to take him away.
the animals were all at work weeding turnips under the supervision of a
pig, when they were astonished to see benjamin come galloping from the
direction of the farm buildings, braying at the top of his voice. it was
the first time that they had ever seen benjamin excited--indeed, it was
the first time that anyone had ever seen him gallop. "quick, quick!" he
shouted. "come at onc

e words. but benjamin pushed her aside and in the midst of a deadly
silence he read:

"'alfred simmonds, horse slaughterer and glue boiler, willingdon. dealer
in hides and bone-meal. kennels supplied.' do you not understand what that
means? they are taking boxer to the knacker's!"

a cry of horror burst from all the animals. at this moment the man on the
box whipped up his horses and the van moved out of the yard at a smart
trot. all the animals followed, crying out at the tops of their voices.
clover forced her way to the front. the van began to gather speed. clover
tried to stir her stout limbs to a gallop, and achieved a canter. "boxer!"
she cried. "boxer! boxer! boxer!" and just at this moment, as though he
had heard the uproar outside, boxer's face, with the white stripe down his
nose, appeared at the small window at the back of the van.

"boxer!" cried clover in a terrible voice. "boxer! get out! get out
quickly! they're taking you to your death!"

all the animals took up the cry of "g

et out, boxer, get out!" but the van
was already gathering speed and drawing away from them. it was uncertain
whether boxer had understood what clover had said. but a moment later his
face disappeared from the window and there was the sound of a tremendous
drumming of hoofs inside the van. he was trying to kick his way out. the
time had been when a few kicks from boxer's hoofs would have smashed the
van to matchwood. but alas! his strength had left him; and in a few
moments the sound of drumming hoofs grew fainter and died away. in
desperation the animals began appealing to the two horses which drew the
van to stop. "comrades, comrades!" they

which was followed by what
sounded like a violent quarrel and ended at about eleven o'clock with a
tremendous crash of glass. no one stirred in the farmhouse before noon on
the following day, and the word went round that from somewhere or other
the pigs had acquired the money to buy themselves another case of whisky.

years passed. the seasons came and went, the short animal lives fled by.
a time came when there was no one who remembered the old days before the
rebellion, except clover, benjamin, moses the raven, and a number of the
pigs.

muriel was dead; bluebell, jessie, and pincher were dead. jones too was
dead--he had died in an inebriates' home in another part of the country.
snowball was forgotten. boxer was forgotten, except by the few who had
known him. clover was an old stout mare now, stiff in the joints and with
a tendency to rheumy eyes. she was two years past the retiring age, but in
fact no animal had ever actually retired. the talk of setting aside a

there were many more creatures on the farm now, though the increase was
not so great as had been expected in earlier years. many animals had been
born to whom the rebellion was only a dim tradition, passed on by word of
mouth, and others had been bought who had never heard mention of such a
thing before their arrival. the farm possessed three horses now besides
clover. they were fine upstanding beasts, willing workers and good
comrades, but very stupid. none of them proved able to learn the alphabet
beyond the letter b. they accepted everything that they were told about
the rebellion and the principles of animalism, especially from clover, for
whom they had an almost filial respect; but it was doubtful whether they
understood very much of it.

the farm was more prosperous now, and better organised: it had even been
enlarged by two fields which had been bough

remaining there for a
whole week, during which time the other animals saw nothing of them.
squealer was with them for the greater part of every day. he was, he said,
teaching them to sing a new song, for which privacy was needed.

it was just after the sheep had returned, on a pleasant evening when the
animals had finished work and were making their way back to the farm
buildings, that the terrified neighing of a horse sounded from the yard.
startled, the animals stopped in their tracks. it was clover's voice. she
neighed again, and all the animals broke into a gallop and rushed into the
yard. then they saw what clover had seen.

it was a pig walking on his hind legs.

yes, it was squealer. a little awkwardly, as though not quite used to
supporting his considerable bulk in that position, but with perfect
balance, he was strolling across the yard. and a moment later, out from
the door of the farmhouse came a long file of pigs, all walking on their
hind legs. some did it better than others, on

t have uttered some word of protest. but just at that moment, as
though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of--

"four legs good, two legs better! four legs good, two legs better! four
legs good, two legs better!"

it went on for five minutes without stopping. and by the time the sheep
had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs
had marched back into the farmhouse.

benjamin felt a nose nuzzling at his shoulder. he looked round. it was
clover. her old eyes looked dimmer than ever. without saying anything, she
tugged gently at his mane and led him round to the end of the big barn,
where the seven commandments were written. for a minute or two they stood
gazing at the tatted wall with its white lettering.

"my sight is failing," she said finally. "even when i was young i could
not have read what was written there. but it appears to me that that wall
looks different. are the seven commandments the same as they used to be,
benjamin?"

the pigs or of the human visitors.

that evening loud laughter and bursts of singing came from the farmhouse.
and suddenly, at the sound of the mingled voices, the animals were
stricken with curiosity. what could be happening in there, now that for
