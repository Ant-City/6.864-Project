moody, with wounded
pride, till the bell rang. she roused up, now, with a vindictive cast
in her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what
_she�d_ do.

at recess tom continued his flirtation with amy with jubilant
self-satisfaction. and he kept drifting about to find becky and lacerate
her with the performance. at last he spied her, but there was a sudden
falling of his mercury. she was sitting cosily on a little bench behind
the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with alfred temple--and so
absorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book,
that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.
jealousy ran red-hot through tom�s veins. he began to hate himself for
throwing away the chance becky had offered for a reconciliation. he
called himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. he
wanted to cry with vexation. amy chatted happily along, as they walked,
for her heart was singing, but tom�s tongue had lost its function.

ut he was in a
fine rage, nevertheless. he moped into the schoolyard wishing she were
a boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. he presently
encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. she hurled
one in return, and the angry breach was complete. it seemed to becky, in
her hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to �take in,�
 she was so impatient to see tom flogged for the injured spelling-book.
if she had had any lingering notion of exposing alfred temple, tom�s
offensive fling had driven it entirely away.

poor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself.
the master, mr. dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied
ambition. the darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but
poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village
schoolmaster. every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and
absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting. he kept
that book under lock and key. there

s for a while after that. becky roused up from her
lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. she
did not expect that tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he
spilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. the denial only
seemed to make the thing worse for tom. becky supposed she would be glad
of that, and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she found she
was not certain. when the worst came to the worst, she had an impulse
to get up and tell on alfred temple, but she made an effort and forced
herself to keep still--because, said she to herself, �he�ll tell about me
tearing the picture sure. i wouldn�t say a word, not to save his life!�

tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all
broken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly
upset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout--he
had denied it for form�s sake and because it was custom, and had stuck
to the denial from principle.

f poor becky�s eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred
floggings. inspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without
an outcry the most merciless flaying that even mr. dobbins had ever
administered; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a
command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed--for he
knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not
count the tedious time as loss, either.

tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against alfred temple; for
with shame and repentance becky had told him all, not forgetting her own
treachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to
pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with becky�s latest words
lingering dreamily in his ear--

�tom, how _could_ you be so noble!�

and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good
showing on �examination� day. his rod a
