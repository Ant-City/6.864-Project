them, i need hardly say.  but i am told that nowadays country society is
quite honeycombed with them.  i think it most irreligious.  and then the
eldest son has quarrelled with his father, and it is said that when they
meet at the club lord brancaster always hides himself behind the money
article in _the times_.  however, i believe that is quite a common
occurrence nowadays and that they have to take in extra copies of _the

pockets_.  _he is looking rather bored_.]

lord goring.  [_pulls out his watch_, _inspects it_, _and rings the
bell_.]  it is a great nuisance.  i can’t find any one in this house to
talk to.  and i am full of interesting information.  i feel like the
latest edition of something or other.

[_enter servant_.]

james.  sir robert is still at the foreign office, my lord.

lord goring.  lady chiltern not down yet?

james.  her ladyship has not yet left her room.  miss chiltern has just
come in from riding.

lord goring.  [_to himself_.]  ah! that is something.

james.  lord caversham has been waiting some time in the library for sir
robert.  i told him your lordship was here.

lord goring.  thank you!  would you kindly tell him i’ve gone?

james.  [_bowing_.]  i shall do so, my lord.
