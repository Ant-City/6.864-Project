id i as we jolted along the rough road, “i
suppose there are few people living within driving distance of this whom
you do not know?”

“hardly any, i think.”

“can you, then, tell me the name of any woman whose initials are l. l.?”

he thought for a few minutes.

“no,” said he. “there are a few gipsies and labouring folk for whom
i can’t answer, but among the farmers or gentry there is no one whose
initials are those. wait a bit though,” he added after a pause. “there
is laura lyons--her initials are l. l.--but she lives in coombe tracey.”

“who is she?” i asked.

“she is frankland’s daughter.”

“what! old frankland the crank?”

“exactly. she married an artist named lyons, who came sketching on the
moor. he proved to be a blackguard and deserted her. the fault from what
i hear may not have been entirely on one side. her father refused to
have anything to do with her because she had married without his consent
and perhaps for one or two other reasons as we

got about, and several of the people here did something to enable her
to earn an honest living. stapleton did for one, and sir charles for
another. i gave a trifle myself. it was to set her up in a typewriting
business.”

he wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but i managed to satisfy
his curiosity without telling him too much, for there is no reason why
we should take anyone into our confidence. tomorrow morning i shall
find my way to coombe tracey, and if i can see this mrs. laura lyons, of
equivocal reputation, a long step will have been made towards clearing
one incident in this chain of mysteries. i am certainly developing the
wisdom of the serpent, for when mortimer pressed his questions to an
inconvenient extent i asked him casually to what type frankland’s skull
belonged, and so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive.
i have not lived for years with sherlock holmes for nothing.

i have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and

“yes, i saw you then.”

“and have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one?”

“no, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide where to
look.”

“the old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt. i could not make it out
when first i saw the light flashing upon the lens.” he rose and peeped
into the hut. “ha, i see that cartwright has brought up some supplies.
what’s this paper? so you have been to coombe tracey, have you?”

“yes.”

“to see mrs. laura lyons?”

“exactly.”

“well done! our researches have evidently been running on parallel
lines, and when we unite our results i expect we shall have a fairly
full knowledge of the case.”

“well, i am glad from my heart that you are here, for indeed the
responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my
nerves. but how in the name of wonder did you come here, and what have
you been doing? i thought that you were in baker street working out that
case of blackmailing.”

“th

 intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult
case.”

i was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon
me, but the warmth of holmes’s praise drove my anger from my mind. i
felt also in my heart that he was right in what he said and that it was
really best for our purpose that i should not have known that he was
upon the moor.

“that’s better,” said he, seeing the shadow rise from my face. “and
now tell me the result of your visit to mrs. laura lyons--it was not
difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone, for
i am already aware that she is the one person in coombe tracey who might
be of service to us in the matter. in fact, if you had not gone today it
is exceedingly probable that i should have gone tomorrow.”

the sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor. the air had turned
chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth. there, sitting together
in the twilight, i told holmes of my conversation with the lady.

 by which one may identify
any man who has been in the profession. a little investigation showed me
that a school had come to grief under atrocious circumstances, and that
the man who had owned it--the name was different--had disappeared with
his wife. the descriptions agreed. when i learned that the missing man
was devoted to entomology the identification was complete.”

the darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by the shadows.

“if this woman is in truth his wife, where does mrs. laura lyons come
in?” i asked.

“that is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed a
light. your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very
much. i did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her
husband. in that case, regarding stapleton as an unmarried man, she
counted no doubt upon becoming his wife.”

“and when she is undeceived?”

“why, then we may find the lady of service. it must be our first duty
to see her--both of us--tomorrow. don’t you t

e not much better off tonight. again, there was no direct
connection between the hound and the man’s death. we never saw the
hound. we heard it, but we could not prove that it was running upon this
man’s trail. there is a complete absence of motive. no, my dear fellow;
we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case at present,
and that it is worth our while to run any risk in order to establish
one.”

“and how do you propose to do so?”

“i have great hopes of what mrs. laura lyons may do for us when the
position of affairs is made clear to her. and i have my own plan as
well. sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof; but i hope before the
day is past to have the upper hand at last.”

i could draw nothing further from him, and he walked, lost in thought,
as far as the baskerville gates.

“are you coming up?”

“yes; i see no reason for further concealment. but one last word,
watson. say nothing of the hound to sir henry. let him think that
selden’s death was a

“yes, sir.”

“and ask at the station office if there is a message for me.”

the boy returned with a telegram, which holmes handed to me. it ran:

lestrade.

“that is in answer to mine of this morning. he is the best of the
professionals, i think, and we may need his assistance. now, watson, i
think that we cannot employ our time better than by calling upon your
acquaintance, mrs. laura lyons.”

his plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. he would use the
baronet in order to convince the stapletons that we were really gone,
while we should actually return at the instant when we were likely to
be needed. that telegram from london, if mentioned by sir henry to the
stapletons, must remove the last suspicions from their minds. already i
seemed to see our nets drawing closer around that leanjawed pike.

threats and even, i am sorry to say, blows refused to move her. she
would have nothing to do with it, and for a time stapleton was at a
deadlock.

“he found a way out of his difficulties through the chance that sir
charles, who had conceived a friendship for him, made him the minister
of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman, mrs. laura lyons.
by representing himself as a single man he acquired complete influence
over her, and he gave her to understand that in the event of her
obtaining a divorce from her husband he would marry her. his plans were
suddenly brought to a head by his knowledge that sir charles was about
to leave the hall on the advice of dr. mortimer, with whose opinion he
himself pretended to coincide. he must act at once, or his victim might
get beyond his power. he therefore put pressure upon mrs. lyons to
write thi

 authorities, alarmed the countryside, and finally brought the case
within the scope of our observation.

“so much for the death of sir charles baskerville. you perceive the
devilish cunning of it, for really it would be almost impossible to make
a case against the real murderer. his only accomplice was one who could
never give him away, and the grotesque, inconceivable nature of
the device only served to make it more effective. both of the women
concerned in the case, mrs. stapleton and mrs. laura lyons, were left
with a strong suspicion against stapleton. mrs. stapleton knew that he
had designs upon the old man, and also of the existence of the hound.
mrs. lyons knew neither of these things, but had been impressed by the
death occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was only
known to him. however, both of them were under his influence, and he had
nothing to fear from them. the first half of his task was successfully
accomplished but the more difficult still remained.
