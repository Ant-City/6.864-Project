finger. â€œmr. jeff margrave,â€ he said clearly; jeff bowed as gracefully
as a man could in the fork of a great limb. â€œmr. vandyck jenningsâ€--i
also tried to make an effective salute and nearly lost my balance.

then terry laid his hand upon his chest--a fine chest he had, too,
and introduced himself; he was braced carefully for the occasion and
achieved an excellent obeisance.

again they laughed delightedly, and the one nearest me followed his
tactics.

â€œcelis,â€ she said distinctly, pointing to the one in blue; â€œalimaâ€--the
one in rose; then, with a vivid imitation of terryâ€™s impressive manner,
she laid a firm delicate hand on her gold-green jerkin--â€œellador.â€ this
was pleasant, but we got no nearer.

â€œwe canâ€™t sit here and learn the language,â€ terry protested. he beckoned
to them to come nearer, most winningly--but they gaily shook their
heads. he suggested, by signs, that we all go down together; but again
they shook their heads,

-there was our motor, lying like a gray cocoon on the flat
pale sheet of water.

quietly but swiftly we rushed forward and began to tug at the fastenings
of that cover.

â€œconfound the thing!â€ terry cried in desperate impatience. â€œtheyâ€™ve got
it sewed up in a bag! and weâ€™ve not a knife among us!â€

then, as we tugged and pulled at that tough cloth we heard a sound that
made terry lift his head like a war horse--the sound of an unmistakable
giggle, yes--three giggles.

there they were--celis, alima, ellador--looking just as they had when
we first saw them, standing a little way off from us, as interested, as
mischievous as three schoolboys.

â€œhold on, terry--hold on!â€ i warned. â€œthatâ€™s too easy. look out for a
trap.â€

â€œlet us appeal to their kind hearts,â€ jeff urged. â€œi think they will
help us. perhaps theyâ€™ve got knives.â€

â€œitâ€™s no use rushing them, anyhow,â€ i was absolutely holding on to
terry. â€œwe know they can out-run and out-climb us.â€

ad not been sparing in helping ourselves. but they seemed somewhat
impressed; and after a murmured consultation they produced from their
pockets certain little packages, and with the utmost ease and accuracy
tossed them into our hands.

jeff was most appreciative of this; and terry made extravagant gestures
of admiration, which seemed to set them off, boy-fashion, to show their
skill. while we ate the excellent biscuits they had thrown us, and while
ellador kept a watchful eye on our movements, celis ran off to some
distance, and set up a sort of â€œduck-on-a-rockâ€ arrangement, a big
yellow nut on top of three balanced sticks; alima, meanwhile, gathering
stones.

they urged us to throw at it, and we did, but the thing was a long way
off, and it was only after a number of failures, at which those elvish
damsels laughed delightedly, that jeff succeeded in bringing the whole
structure to the ground. it took me still longer, and terry, to his
intense annoyance, came third.

then celis set up

he changed his
manner somewhat and got on better. he had to. for, in spite of his
criticism, they were girls, and, furthermore, all the girls there
were! always excepting our three!--with whom we presently renewed our
acquaintance.

when it came to courtship, which it soon did, i can of course best
describe my own--and am least inclined to. but of jeff i heard somewhat;
he was inclined to dwell reverently and admiringly, at some length,
on the exalted sentiment and measureless perfection of his celis; and
terry--terry made so many false starts and met so many rebuffs, that by
the time he really settled down to win alima, he was considerably wiser.
at that, it was not smooth sailing. they broke and quarreled, over and
over; he would rush off to console himself with some other fair one--the
other fair one would have none of him--and he would drift back to alima,
becoming more and more devoted each time.

 little more than ordinarily pleasant--and then you find
rich farmland, and then gardens, gorgeous gardens, and then palaces
full of rare and curious treasures--incalculable, inexhaustible, and
then--mountains--like the himalayas, and then the sea.

i liked her that day she balanced on the branch before me and named the
trio. i thought of her most. afterward i turned to her like a friend
when we met for the third time, and continued the acquaintance. while
jeffâ€™s ultra-devotion rather puzzled celis, really put off their day
of happiness, while terry and alima quarreled and parted, re-met and
re-parted, ellador and i grew to be close friends.

we talked and talked. we took long walks together. she showed me things,
explained them, interpreted much that i had not understood. through her
sympathetic intelligence i became more and more comprehending of the
spirit of the people of herland, more and more appreciative of its
marvelous inner growth as well as outer perfection.

gazing out over the far dim forestland below, talking of heaven and
earth and human life, and of my land and other lands and what they
needed and what i hoped to do for them--

â€œif you will help me,â€ i said.

she turned to me, with that high, sweet look of hers, and then, as her
eyes rested in mine and her hands too--then suddenly there blazed out
between us a farther glory, instant, overwhelming--quite beyond any
words of mine to tell.

celis was a blue-and-gold-and-rose person; alma,
black-and-white-and-red, a blazing beauty. ellador was brown: hair dark
and soft, like a seal coat; clear brown skin with a healthy red in
it; brown eyes--all the way from topaz to black velvet they seemed to
range--splendid girls, all of them.

they had seen us first of all, far down in the lake below, and flashed
the tidings across the land even before our first exploring flight. they
had watched our landing, flitted through the forest with us, hidde

motherhood.

yet while the mother process remains, the inherent ground for
sex-distinction remains also; and who shall say what long-forgotten
feeling, vague and nameless, was stirred in some of these mother hearts
by our arrival?

what left us even more at sea in our approach was the lack of any
sex-tradition. there was no accepted standard of what was â€œmanlyâ€ and
what was â€œwomanly.â€

when jeff said, taking the fruit basket from his adored one, â€œa woman
should not carry anything,â€ celis said, â€œwhy?â€ with the frankest
amazement. he could not look that fleet-footed, deep-chested young
forester in the face and say, â€œbecause she is weaker.â€ she wasnâ€™t. one
does not call a race horse weak because it is visibly not a cart horse.

he said, rather lamely, that women were not built for heavy work.

she looked out across the fields to where some women were working,
building a new bit of wall out of large stones; looked back at the
nearest town with its woman-built houses; down

l,â€ terry begged lazily. â€œwhy arenâ€™t you willing to
be worshipped and waited on? we like to do it.â€

â€œyou donâ€™t like to have us do it to you,â€ she answered.

â€œthatâ€™s different,â€ he said, annoyed; and when she said, â€œwhy is it?â€ he
quite sulked, referring her to me, saying, â€œvanâ€™s the philosopher.â€

ellador and i talked it all out together, so that we had an easier
experience of it when the real miracle time came. also, between us, we
made things clearer to jeff and celis. but terry would not listen to
reason.

he was madly in love with alima. he wanted to take her by storm, and
nearly lost her forever.

you see, if a man loves a girl who is in the first place young and
inexperienced; who in the second place is educated with a background
of caveman tradition, a middle-ground of poetry and romance, and a
foreground of unspoken hope and interest all centering upon the one
event; and who has, furthermore, absolutely no other hope or interest
worthy of the name--why

process. he tried it here, and alima was so affronted, so repelled, that
it was weeks before he got near enough to try again.

the more coldly she denied him, the hotter his determination; he was
not used to real refusal. the approach of flattery she dismissed with
laughter, gifts and such â€œattentionsâ€ we could not bring to bear, pathos
and complaint of cruelty stirred only a reasoning inquiry. it took terry
a long time.

i doubt if she ever accepted her strange lover as fully as did celis
and ellador theirs. he had hurt and offended her too often; there were
reservations.

but i think alima retained some faint vestige of long-descended feeling
which made terry more possible to her than to others; and that she had
made up her mind to the experiment and hated to renounce it.

however it came about, we all three at length achieved full
understanding, and solemnly faced what was to them a step of measureless
importance, a grave question as well as a great happiness; to us a

of marriage as a ceremony they knew nothing. jeff was for bringing them
to our country for the religious and the civil ceremony, but neither
celis nor the others would consent.

â€œwe canâ€™t expect them to want to go with us--yet,â€ said terry sagely.
â€œwait a bit, boys. weâ€™ve got to take â€˜em on their own terms--if at all.â€
 this, in rueful reminiscence of his repeated failures.

â€œbut our timeâ€™s coming,â€ he added cheerfully. â€œthese women have never
been mastered, you see--â€ this, as one who had made a discovery.

â€œyouâ€™d better not try to do any mastering if you value your chances,â€

mothers, nor children, nor compatriots; so, if they loved us, we must be
friends.

that we should pair off together in our courting days was natural to
them; that we three should remain much together, as they did themselves,
was also natural. we had as yet no work, so we hung about them in their
forest tasks; that was natural, too.

but when we began to talk about each couple having â€œhomesâ€ of our own,
they could not understand it.

â€œour work takes us all around the country,â€ explained celis. â€œwe cannot
live in one place all the time.â€

â€œwe are together now,â€ urged alima, looking proudly at terryâ€™s stalwart
nearness. (this was one of the times when they were â€œon,â€ though
presently â€œoffâ€ again.)

â€œitâ€™s not the same thing at all,â€ he insisted. â€œa man wants a home of
his own, with his wife and family in it.â€

â€œstaying in it? all the time?â€ asked ellador. â€œnot imprisoned, surely!â€

â€œof course not! living there--naturally,â€ he answered.

re rested.

ellador told me a lot about it. she took me to see the children, the
growing girls, the special teachers. she picked out books for me to
read. she always seemed to understand just what i wanted to know, and
how to give it to me.

while terry and alima struck sparks and parted--he always madly drawn
to her and she to him--she must have been, or sheâ€™d never have stood the
way he behaved--ellador and i had already a deep, restful feeling, as
if weâ€™d always had one another. jeff and celis were happy; there was no
question of that; but it didnâ€™t seem to me as if they had the good times
we did.

well, here is the herland child facing life--as ellador tried to show
it to me. from the first memory, they knew peace, beauty, order, safety,
love, wisdom, justice, patience, and plenty. by â€œplentyâ€ i mean that the
babies grew up in an environment which met their needs, just as young
fawns might grow up in dewy forest glades and brook-fed meadows. and
they enjoyed it as frankly and

mrs. nicholson,â€ he said. â€œmrs. t. o. nicholson. that shows
everyone that you are my wife.â€

â€œwhat is a â€˜wifeâ€™ exactly?â€ she demanded, a dangerous gleam in her eye.

â€œa wife is the woman who belongs to a man,â€ he began.

but jeff took it up eagerly: â€œand a husband is the man who belongs to
a woman. it is because we are monogamous, you know. and marriage is the
ceremony, civil and religious, that joins the two together--â€˜until death
do us part,â€™â€ he finished, looking at celis with unutterable devotion.

â€œwhat makes us all feel foolish,â€ i told the girls, â€œis that here we
have nothing to give you--except, of course, our names.â€

â€œdo your women have no names before they are married?â€ celis suddenly
demanded.

â€œwhy, yes,â€ jeff explained. â€œthey have their maiden names--their
fatherâ€™s names, that is.â€

â€œand what becomes of them?â€ asked alima.

â€œthey change them for their husbandsâ€™, my dear,â€ terry answered her.

â€œchange them? do the husb

 he laughed. â€œthe man keeps his own and gives it to her, too.â€

â€œthen she just loses hers and takes a new one--how unpleasant! we wonâ€™t
do that!â€ alima said decidedly.

terry was good-humored about it. â€œi donâ€™t care what you do or donâ€™t do
so long as we have that wedding pretty soon,â€ he said, reaching a strong
brown hand after alimaâ€™s, quite as brown and nearly as strong.

â€œas to giving us things--of course we can see that youâ€™d like to, but
we are glad you canâ€™t,â€ celis continued. â€œyou see, we love you just for
yourselves--we wouldnâ€™t want you to--to pay anything. isnâ€™t it enough to
know that you are loved personally--and just as men?â€

enough or not, that was the way we were married. we had a great triple
wedding in the biggest temple of all, and it looked as if most of the
nation was present. it was very solemn and very beautiful. someone had
written a new song for the occasion, nobly beautiful, about the new hope
for their people--the new tie with o

terry, at his worst, in a black fury for which, as a man, i must have
some sympathy, preferred the ant simile. more of terry and his special
troubles later. it was hard on terry.

jeff--well, jeff always had a streak that was too good for this world!
heâ€™s the kind that would have made a saintly priest in parentagearlier
times. he accepted the angel theory, swallowed it whole, tried to force
it on us--with varying effect. he so worshipped celis, and not only
celis, but what she represented; he had become so deeply convinced of
the almost supernatural advantages of this country and people, that he
took his medicine like a--i cannot say â€œlike a man,â€ but more as if he
wasnâ€™t one.

donâ€™t misunderstand me for a moment. dear old jeff was no milksop or
molly-coddle either. he was a strong, brave, efficient man, and an
excellent fighter when fighting was necessary. but there was always this
angel streak in him. it was rather a wonder

the witch! if ever anybody worked to woo and win and hold a human soul,
she did, great superwoman that she was. i couldnâ€™t then half comprehend
the skill of it, the wonder. but this i soon began to find: that under
all our cultivated attitude of mind toward women, there is an older,
deeper, more â€œnaturalâ€ feeling, the restful reverence which looks up to
the mother sex.

so we grew together in friendship and happiness, ellador and i, and so
did jeff and celis.

when it comes to terryâ€™s part of it, and alimaâ€™s, iâ€™m sorry--and
iâ€™m ashamed. of course i blame her somewhat. she wasnâ€™t as fine
a psychologist as ellador, and whatâ€™s more, i think she had a
far-descended atavistic trace of more marked femaleness, never apparent
till terry called it out. but when all is said, it doesnâ€™t excuse him. i
hadnâ€™t realized to the full terryâ€™s character--i couldnâ€™t, being a man.

nt an outbreak. he had no weapons, and well knew
that all his strength was of small avail against those grim, quiet
women.

we were allowed to visit him freely, but he had only his room, and a
small high-walled garden to walk in, while the preparations for our
departure were under way.

three of us were to go: terry, because he must; i, because two were
safer for our flyer, and the long boat trip to the coast; ellador,
because she would not let me go without her.

if jeff had elected to return, celis would have gone too--they were the
most absorbed of lovers; but jeff had no desire that way.

â€œwhy should i want to go back to all our noise and dirt, our vice and
crime, our disease and degeneracy?â€ he demanded of me privately. we
never spoke like that before the women. â€œi wouldnâ€™t take celis there for
anything on earth!â€ he protested. â€œsheâ€™d die! sheâ€™d die of horror and
shame to see our slums and hospitals. how can you risk it with ellador?
youâ€™d better break it to her gentl

 see, i loved her so
much that even the restrictions she so firmly established left me much
happiness. we were lovers, and there is surely delight enough in that.

do not imagine that these young women utterly refused â€œthe great new
hope,â€ as they called it, that of dual parentage. for that they had
agreed to marry us, though the marrying part of it was a concession
to our prejudices rather than theirs. to them the process was the holy
thing--and they meant to keep it holy.

but so far only celis, her blue eyes swimming in happy tears, her
heart lifted with that tide of race-motherhood which was their supreme
passion, could with ineffable joy and pride announce that she was to
be a mother. â€œthe new motherhoodâ€ they called it, and the whole country
knew. there was no pleasure, no service, no honor in all the land that
celis might not have had. almost like the breathless reverence with
which, two thousand years ago, that dwindling band of women had watched
the miracle of virgin birth,

itate and didnâ€™t smother.

i looked at ellador as if i hadnâ€™t seen her before. â€œif you wonâ€™t go,â€
 i said, â€œiâ€™ll get terry to the coast and come back alone. you can let me
down a rope. and if you will go--why you blessed wonder-woman--i would
rather live with you all my life--like this--than to have any other
woman i ever saw, or any number of them, to do as i like with. will you
come?â€

she was keen for coming. so the plans went on. sheâ€™d have liked to wait
for that marvel of celisâ€™s, but terry had no such desire. he was crazy
to be out of it all. it made him sick, he said, sick; this everlasting
mother-mother-mothering. i donâ€™t think terry had what the phrenologists
call â€œthe lump of philoprogenitivenessâ€ at all well developed.

â€œmorbid one-sided cripples,â€ he called them, even when from his window
he could see their splendid vigor and beauty; even while moadine, as
patient and friendly as if she had never helped alima to hold and bind
him, sat there in the r

ison-arrow natives down below and widening out to the broad racial
divisions we had told them about. never a shocked expression of the face
or exclamation of revolt had warned us; they had been extracting the
evidence without our knowing it all this time, and now were studying
with the most devout earnestness the matter they had prepared.

the result was rather distressing to us. they first explained the matter
fully to ellador, as she was the one who purposed visiting the rest
of the world. to celis they said nothing. she must not be in any way
distressed, while the whole nation waited on her great work.

finally jeff and i were called in. somel and zava were there, and
ellador, with many others that we knew.

they had a great globe, quite fairly mapped out from the small section
maps in that compendium of ours. they had the different peoples of the
earth roughly outlined, and their status in civilization indicated.
they had charts and figures and estimates, based on the facts in that
