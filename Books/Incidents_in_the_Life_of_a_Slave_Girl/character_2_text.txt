she was safe. my grandmother shook her head, without answering. "come, aunt martha," said the kind lady, "tell me all about it. perhaps i can do something to help you." the husband of this lady held many slaves, and bought and sold slaves. she also held a number in her own name; but she treated them kindly, and would never allow any of them to be sold. she was unlike the majority of slaveholders' wives. my grandmother looked earnestly at her. something in the expression of her face said "trust me!" and she did trust her. she listened attentively to the details of my story, an

d sat thinking for a while. at last she said, "aunt martha, i pity you both. if you think there is any chance of linda's getting to the free states, i will conceal her for a time. but first you must solemnly promise that my name shall never be mentioned. if such a thing should become known, it would ruin me and my family. no one in my house must know of it, except the cook. she is so faithful that i would trust my own life with her; and i know she likes linda. it is a great risk; but i trust no harm will come of it. get word to linda to be ready as soo
