and now i
wouldnâ€™t change places with an angel!â€

that night a thoroughly happy, completely tired-out anne returned to
green gables in a state of beatification impossible to describe.

â€œoh, marilla, iâ€™ve had a perfectly scrumptious time. scrumptious is a
new word i learned today. i heard mary alice bell use it. isnâ€™t it very
expressive? everything was lovely. we had a splendid tea and then mr.
harmon andrews took us all for a row on the lake of shining waters--six
of us at a time. and jane andrews nearly fell overboard. she was leaning
out to pick water lilies and if mr. andrews hadnâ€™t caught her by her
sash just in the nick of time sheâ€™d fallen in and probâ€™ly been drowned.
i wish it had been me. it would have been such a romantic experience to
have been nearly drowned. it would be such a thrilling tale to tell. and
we had the ice cream. words fail me to describe that ice cream. marilla,
i assure you it was sublime.â€

that evening marilla told the whole story to matthew over her

 was disgraceful and he held up my slate so that everybody could
see it, all marked over. i felt so mortified, marilla; he might have
been politer to a stranger, i think. ruby gillis gave me an apple and
sophia sloane lent me a lovely pink card with â€˜may i see you home?â€™ on
it. iâ€™m to give it back to her tomorrow. and tillie boulter let me wear
her bead ring all the afternoon. can i have some of those pearl beads
off the old pincushion in the garret to make myself a ring? and oh,
marilla, jane andrews told me that minnie macpherson told her that she
heard prissy andrews tell sara gillis that i had a very pretty nose.
marilla, that is the first compliment i have ever had in my life and you
canâ€™t imagine what a strange feeling it gave me. marilla, have i really
a pretty nose? i know youâ€™ll tell me the truth.â€

â€œyour nose is well enough,â€ said marilla shortly. secretly she thought
anneâ€™s nose was a remarkable pretty one; but she had no intention of
telling her so.

that was three we

€™d do almost anything in the world for you, diana,â€ said anne sadly.
â€œiâ€™d let myself be torn limb from limb if it would do you any good. but
i canâ€™t do this, so please donâ€™t ask it. you harrow up my very soul.â€

â€œjust think of all the fun you will miss,â€ mourned diana. â€œwe are going
to build the loveliest new house down by the brook; and weâ€™ll be playing
ball next week and youâ€™ve never played ball, anne. itâ€™s tremendously
exciting. and weâ€™re going to learn a new song--jane andrews is
practicing it up now; and alice andrews is going to bring a new pansy
book next week and weâ€™re all going to read it out loud, chapter about,
down by the brook. and you know you are so fond of reading out loud,
anne.â€

nothing moved anne in the least. her mind was made up. she would not go
to school to mr. phillips again; she told marilla so when she got home.

â€œnonsense,â€ said marilla.

â€œit isnâ€™t nonsense at all,â€ said anne, gazing at marilla with solemn,
reproachful eyes. â€œd

g day.

hence, while marilla and mrs. rachel were enjoying themselves hugely
at the mass meeting, anne and matthew had the cheerful kitchen at green
gables all to themselves. a bright fire was glowing in the old-fashioned
waterloo stove and blue-white frost crystals were shining on the
windowpanes. matthew nodded over a _farmersâ€™ advocate_ on the sofa and
anne at the table studied her lessons with grim determination, despite
sundry wistful glances at the clock shelf, where lay a new book that
jane andrews had lent her that day. jane had assured her that it was
warranted to produce any number of thrills, or words to that effect, and
anneâ€™s fingers tingled to reach out for it. but that would mean gilbert
blytheâ€™s triumph on the morrow. anne turned her back on the clock shelf
and tried to imagine it wasnâ€™t there.

â€œmatthew, did you ever study geometry when you went to school?â€

â€œwell now, no, i didnâ€™t,â€ said matthew, coming out of his doze with a
start.

â€œi wish you had,â€ sighed

as he got up to make his farewell speech she
burst into tears. then all the girls began to cry, one after the other.
i tried to hold out, marilla. i tried to remember the time mr. phillips
made me sit with gil--with a boy; and the time he spelled my name
without an â€˜eâ€™ on the blackboard; and how he said i was the worst dunce
he ever saw at geometry and laughed at my spelling; and all the times he
had been so horrid and sarcastic; but somehow i couldnâ€™t, marilla, and i
just had to cry too. jane andrews has been talking for a month about how
glad sheâ€™d be when mr. phillips went away and she declared sheâ€™d never
shed a tear. well, she was worse than any of us and had to borrow a
handkerchief from her brother--of course the boys didnâ€™t cry--because
she hadnâ€™t brought one of her own, not expecting to need it. oh,
marilla, it was heartrending. mr. phillips made such a beautiful
farewell speech beginning, â€˜the time has come for us to part.â€™ it was
very affecting. and he had tears in his

out mr.
phillips going away i couldnâ€™t help taking a little interest in a new
minister, could i? his wife is very pretty. not exactly regally lovely,
of course--it wouldnâ€™t do, i suppose, for a minister to have a regally
lovely wife, because it might set a bad example. mrs. lynde says the
ministerâ€™s wife over at newbridge sets a very bad example because she
dresses so fashionably. our new ministerâ€™s wife was dressed in blue
muslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses.
jane andrews said she thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for
a ministerâ€™s wife, but i didnâ€™t make any such uncharitable remark,
marilla, because i know what it is to long for puffed sleeves. besides,
sheâ€™s only been a ministerâ€™s wife for a little while, so one should
make allowances, shouldnâ€™t they? they are going to board with mrs. lynde
until the manse is ready.â€

any motive save her avowed one of returning the quil

 summer because the doers
thereof were â€œdaredâ€ to do them would fill a book by themselves.

first of all carrie sloane dared ruby gillis to climb to a certain point
in the huge old willow tree before the front door; which ruby gillis,
albeit in mortal dread of the fat green caterpillars with which said
tree was infested and with the fear of her mother before her eyes if she
should tear her new muslin dress, nimbly did, to the discomfiture of the
aforesaid carrie sloane. then josie pye dared jane andrews to hop on her
left leg around the garden without stopping once or putting her right
foot to the ground; which jane andrews gamely tried to do, but gave out
at the third corner and had to confess herself defeated.

josieâ€™s triumph being rather more pronounced than good taste permitted,
anne shirley dared her to walk along the top of the board fence which
bounded the garden to the east. now, to â€œwalkâ€ board fences requires
more skill and steadiness of head and heel than one might suppose wh

gs about the
new teacher. the girls all think she is perfectly sweet. diana says she
has the loveliest fair curly hair and such fascinating eyes. she dresses
beautifully, and her sleeve puffs are bigger than anybody elseâ€™s in
avonlea. every other friday afternoon she has recitations and everybody
has to say a piece or take part in a dialogue. oh, itâ€™s just glorious to
think of it. josie pye says she hates it but that is just because josie
has so little imagination. diana and ruby gillis and jane andrews are
preparing a dialogue, called â€˜a morning visit,â€™ for next friday. and the
friday afternoons they donâ€™t have recitations miss stacy takes them
all to the woods for a â€˜fieldâ€™ day and they study ferns and flowers
and birds. and they have physical culture exercises every morning and
evening. mrs. lynde says she never heard of such goings on and it all
comes of having a lady teacher. but i think it must be splendid and i
believe i shall find that miss stacy is a kindred spirit.â€

uplifted. iâ€™m going to practice my recitations in the garret. donâ€™t be
alarmed if you hear me groaning. i have to groan heartrendingly in one
of them, and itâ€™s really hard to get up a good artistic groan, marilla.
josie pye is sulky because she didnâ€™t get the part she wanted in
the dialogue. she wanted to be the fairy queen. that would have been
ridiculous, for who ever heard of a fairy queen as fat as josie? fairy
queens must be slender. jane andrews is to be the queen and i am to be
one of her maids of honor. josie says she thinks a red-haired fairy is
just as ridiculous as a fat one, but i do not let myself mind what josie
says. iâ€™m to have a wreath of white roses on my hair and ruby gillis
is going to lend me her slippers because i havenâ€™t any of my own. itâ€™s
necessary for fairies to have slippers, you know. you couldnâ€™t imagine
a fairy wearing boots, could you? especially with copper toes? we are
going to decorate the hall with

 â€œiâ€™ve
just thought of a plan, diana. let you and me have a story club all our
own and write stories for practice. iâ€™ll help you along until you can
do them by yourself. you ought to cultivate your imagination, you know.
miss stacy says so. only we must take the right way. i told her about
the haunted wood, but she said we went the wrong way about it in that.â€

this was how the story club came into existence. it was limited to diana
and anne at first, but soon it was extended to include jane andrews
and ruby gillis and one or two others who felt that their imaginations
needed cultivating. no boys were allowed in it--although ruby gillis
opined that their admission would make it more exciting--and each member
had to produce one story a week.

â€œitâ€™s extremely interesting,â€ anne told marilla. â€œeach girl has to read
her story out loud and then we talk it over. we are going to keep them
all sacredly and have them to read to our descendants. we each write
under a nom-de-plume. mine is ro

chapter xxviii. an unfortunate lily maid


|of course you must be elaine, anne,â€ said diana. â€œi could never have
the courage to float down there.â€

â€œnor i,â€ said ruby gillis, with a shiver. â€œi donâ€™t mind floating down
when thereâ€™s two or three of us in the flat and we can sit up. itâ€™s fun
then. but to lie down and pretend i was dead--i just couldnâ€™t. iâ€™d die
really of fright.â€

â€œof course it would be romantic,â€ conceded jane andrews, â€œbut i know i
couldnâ€™t keep still. iâ€™d be popping up every minute or so to see where i
was and if i wasnâ€™t drifting too far out. and you know, anne, that would
spoil the effect.â€

â€œbut itâ€™s so ridiculous to have a redheaded elaine,â€ mourned anne. â€œiâ€™m
not afraid to float down and iâ€™d love to be elaine. but itâ€™s ridiculous
just the same. ruby ought to be elaine because she is so fair and has
such lovely long golden hair--elaine had â€˜all her bright hair streaming

arfully old and grown up. but why was miss stacy
here this afternoon?â€

â€œthat is what i want to tell you, anne, if youâ€™ll ever give me a chance
to get a word in edgewise. she was talking about you.â€

â€œabout me?â€ anne looked rather scared. then she flushed and exclaimed:

â€œoh, i know what she was saying. i meant to tell you, marilla, honestly
i did, but i forgot. miss stacy caught me reading ben hur in school
yesterday afternoon when i should have been studying my canadian
history. jane andrews lent it to me. i was reading it at dinner hour,
and i had just got to the chariot race when school went in. i was simply
wild to know how it turned out--although i felt sure ben hur must win,
because it wouldnâ€™t be poetical justice if he didnâ€™t--so i spread the
history open on my desk lid and then tucked ben hur between the desk and
my knee. i just looked as if i were studying canadian history, you know,
while all the while i was reveling in ben hur. i was so interested in it
that i never n

€œi shall take more interest than ever in my studies now,â€ said anne
blissfully, â€œbecause i have a purpose in life. mr. allan says everybody
should have a purpose in life and pursue it faithfully. only he says
we must first make sure that it is a worthy purpose. i would call it a
worthy purpose to want to be a teacher like miss stacy, wouldnâ€™t you,
marilla? i think itâ€™s a very noble profession.â€

the queenâ€™s class was organized in due time. gilbert blythe, anne
shirley, ruby gillis, jane andrews, josie pye, charlie sloane, and moody
spurgeon macpherson joined it. diana barry did not, as her parents
did not intend to send her to queenâ€™s. this seemed nothing short of a
calamity to anne. never, since the night on which minnie may had had the
croup, had she and diana been separated in anything. on the evening when
the queenâ€™s class first remained in school for the extra lessons and
anne saw diana go slowly out with the others, to walk home alone through
the birch path and violet vale,

and be very dignified. it wonâ€™t even do to believe in fairies
then, iâ€™m afraid; so iâ€™m going to believe in them with all my whole
heart this summer. i think weâ€™re going to have a very gay vacation. ruby
gillis is going to have a birthday party soon and thereâ€™s the sunday
school picnic and the missionary concert next month. and mr. barry says
that some evening heâ€™ll take diana and me over to the white sands hotel
and have dinner there. they have dinner there in the evening, you know.
jane andrews was over once last summer and she says it was a dazzling
sight to see the electric lights and the flowers and all the lady guests
in such beautiful dresses. jane says it was her first glimpse into high
life and sheâ€™ll never forget it to her dying day.â€

mrs. lynde came up the next afternoon to find out why marilla had not
been at the aid meeting on thursday. when marilla was not at aid meeting
people knew there was something wrong at green gables.

â€œmatthew had a bad spell with his heart

and mark us just as strictly, so
weâ€™ll have some idea. i wish it was all over, marilla. it haunts me.
sometimes i wake up in the night and wonder what iâ€™ll do if i donâ€™t
pass.â€

â€œwhy, go to school next year and try again,â€ said marilla unconcernedly.

â€œoh, i donâ€™t believe iâ€™d have the heart for it. it would be such a
disgrace to fail, especially if gil--if the others passed. and i get so
nervous in an examination that iâ€™m likely to make a mess of it. i wish i
had nerves like jane andrews. nothing rattles her.â€

anne sighed and, dragging her eyes from the witcheries of the spring
world, the beckoning day of breeze and blue, and the green things
upspringing in the garden, buried herself resolutely in her book.
there would be other springs, but if she did not succeed in passing the
entrance, anne felt convinced that she would never recover sufficiently
to enjoy them.

recite.

as anne would have said at one time, it was â€œan epoch in her life,â€ and
she was deliciously athrill with the excitement of it. matthew was in
the seventh heaven of gratified pride over the honor conferred on his
anne and marilla was not far behind, although she would have died rather
than admit it, and said she didnâ€™t think it was very proper for a lot
of young folks to be gadding over to the hotel without any responsible
person with them.

anne and diana were to drive over with jane andrews and her brother
billy in their double-seated buggy; and several other avonlea girls and
boys were going too. there was a party of visitors expected out from
town, and after the concert a supper was to be given to the performers.

â€œdo you really think the organdy will be best?â€ queried anne anxiously.
â€œi donâ€™t think itâ€™s as pretty as my blue-flowered muslin--and it
certainly isnâ€™t so fashionable.â€

 â€œbut it suits you ever so much better,â€ said diana. â€œitâ€™s so soft

btful, any one of a certain six being a possible
winner. the bronze medal for mathematics was considered as good as
won by a fat, funny little up-country boy with a bumpy forehead and a
patched coat.

ruby gillis was the handsomest girl of the year at the academy; in the
second year classes stella maynard carried off the palm for beauty, with
small but critical minority in favor of anne shirley. ethel marr was
admitted by all competent judges to have the most stylish modes
of hair-dressing, and jane andrews--plain, plodding, conscientious
jane--carried off the honors in the domestic science course. even josie
pye attained a certain preeminence as the sharpest-tongued young lady in
attendance at queenâ€™s. so it may be fairly stated that miss stacyâ€™s old
pupils held their own in the wider arena of the academical course.

anne worked hard and steadily. her rivalry with gilbert was as intense
as it had ever been in avonlea school, although it was not known in the
class at large, but somehow the bit
