chapter 1. marseilles--the arrival

on the 24th of february, 1815, the look-out at notre-dame de la garde
signalled the three-master, the _pharaon_ from smyrna, trieste, and
naples.

as usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the chÃ¢teau dâ€™if,
got on board the vessel between cape morgion and rion island.

immediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of fort saint-jean
were covered with spectators; it is always an event at marseilles for a

 surprise.

â€œsinbad the sailor?â€ he said.

â€œyes,â€ replied the narrator; â€œthat was the name which the traveller gave
to vampa as his own.â€

â€œwell, and what may you have to say against this name?â€ inquired albert;
â€œit is a very pretty name, and the adventures of the gentleman of that
name amused me very much in my youth, i must confess.â€

franz said no more. the name of sinbad the sailor, as may well be
supposed, awakened in him a world of recollections, as had the name of
the count of monte cristo on the previous evening.

â€œproceed!â€ said he to the host.

â€œvampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket, and slowly
returned by the way he had gone. as he came within two or three hundred
paces of the grotto, he thought he heard a cry. he listened to know
whence this sound could proceed. a moment afterwards he thought he heard
his own name pronounced distinctly. the cry proceeded from the grotto.
he bounded like a chamois, cocking his carbine as he went, and in a
moment reached th

€ replied signor pastrini, with the air of a man
perfectly well satisfied with himself.

â€œtake care, my worthy host,â€ said albert, â€œ_better_ is a sure enemy to
_well_.â€

â€œlet your excellencies only leave the matter to me,â€ returned signor
pastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded self-confidence.

â€œbut what _have_ you done?â€ asked franz. â€œspeak out, thereâ€™s a worthy
fellow.â€

â€œyour excellencies are aware,â€ responded the landlord, swelling with
importance, â€œthat the count of monte cristo is living on the same floor
with yourselves!â€

â€œi should think we did know it,â€ exclaimed albert, â€œsince it is owing to
that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms, like two
poor students in the back streets of paris.â€

â€œwhen, then, the count of monte cristo, hearing of the dilemma in which
you are placed, has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two
places at his windows in the palazzo rospoli.â€ the friends looked at
each other with unutterable surprise.

€œbut do you think,â€ asked albert, â€œthat we ought to accept such offers
from a perfect stranger?â€

â€œwhat sort of person is this count of monte cristo?â€ asked franz of his
host.

â€œa very great nobleman, but whether maltese or sicilian i cannot exactly
say; but this i know, that he is noble as a borghese and rich as a gold
mine.â€

â€œit seems to me,â€ said franz, speaking in an undertone to albert, â€œthat
if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord, he would
have conveyed his invitation through another channel, and not permitted
it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way. he would have written-
-or----â€

instant someone knocked at the door.

â€œcome in,â€ said franz.

a servant, wearing a livery of considerable style and richness, appeared
at the threshold, and, placing two cards in the landlordâ€™s hands, who
forthwith presented them to the two young men, he said, â€œplease to
deliver these, from the count of monte cristo to viscomte albert de
morcerf and m. franz dâ€™epinay. the count of monte cristo,â€ continued the
servant, â€œbegs these gentlemenâ€™s permission to wait upon them as their
neighbor, and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will
please to receive him.â€

â€œfaith, franz,â€ whispered albert, â€œthere is not much to find fault with
here.â€

â€œtell the count,â€ replied franz, â€œthat we will do ourselves the pleasure
of calling on him.â€ the servant bowed and retired.

â€œthat is what i call an elegant mode of attack,â€ said albert, â€œyou were

felt sure he would) the same as
the person he had just seen in the teatro argentina, then he should be
able to establish his identity, and also to prosecute his researches
respecting him with perfect facility and freedom. franz passed the night
in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had already had with
his mysterious tormentor, and in waking speculations as to what the
morrow would produce. the next day must clear up every doubt; and unless
his near neighbor and would-be friend, the count of monte cristo,
possessed the ring of gyges, and by its power was able to render himself
invisible, it was very certain he could not escape this time. eight
oâ€™clock found franz up and dressed, while albert, who had not the same
motives for early rising, was still soundly asleep. the first act of
franz was to summon his landlord, who presented himself with his
accustomed obsequiousness.

â€œpray, signor pastrini,â€ asked franz, â€œis not some execution appointed
to take place today?â€

â€œyes, your excelle

porto-vecchio and tunis. time was
getting on, however, and franz deemed it advisable to awaken albert; but
at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber, his friend entered
the room in perfect costume for the day. the anticipated delights of the
carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long
before his usual hour.

â€œnow, my excellent signor pastrini,â€ said franz, addressing his
landlord, â€œsince we are both ready, do you think we may proceed at once
to visit the count of monte cristo?â€

â€œmost assuredly,â€ replied he. â€œthe count of monte cristo is always an
early riser; and i can answer for his having been up these two hours.â€

â€œthen you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our
respects to him directly?â€


â€œoh, i am quite sure. i will take all the blame on myself if you find i
have led you into an error.â€

â€œwell, then, if it be so, are you ready, albert?â€

â€œperfectly.â€

â€œlet us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy.â€

its
hinges, and almost immediately afterwards the tapestry was drawn aside,
and the owner of all these riches stood before the two young men. albert
instantly rose to meet him, but franz remained, in a manner, spellbound
on his chair; for in the person of him who had just entered he
recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the colosseum, and the
occupant of the box at the teatro argentina, but also his extraordinary
host of monte cristo.



chapter 35. la mazzolata

gentlemen,â€ said the count of monte cristo as he entered, â€œi pray you
excuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated; but i feared to
disturb you by presenting myself earlier at your apartments; besides,
you sent me word that you would come to me, and i have held myself at
your disposal.â€

â€œfranz and i have to thank you a thousand times, count,â€ returned
albert; â€œyou extricated us from a great dilemma, and we were on the
point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly
invitation reached us.â€

â€œindeed,â€

eakfast is
ready.â€ as he spoke, a servant opened one of the four doors of the
apartment, saying--â€œ_al suo commodo!_â€ the two young men arose and
entered the breakfast-room.

during the meal, which was excellent, and admirably served, franz looked
repeatedly at albert, in order to observe the impressions which he
doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer; but
whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to
him, whether the explanation of the count of monte cristo with regard to
duelling had satisfied him, or whether the events which franz knew of
had had their effect on him alone, he remarked that his companion did
not pay the least regard to them, but on the contrary ate like a man who
for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of
italian cookery--that is, the worst in the world. as for the count, he
just touched the dishes; he seemed to fulfil the duties of a host by
sitting down with his guests, and awaited their departure to be s

o he is, gentlemen; will you
return to the salon? you will find good cigars on the centre table. i
will be with you directly.â€ the young men rose and returned into the
salon, while the count, again apologizing, left by another door. albert,
who was a great smoker, and who had considered it no small sacrifice to
be deprived of the cigars of the cafÃ© de paris, approached the table,
and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable _puros_.

â€œwell,â€ asked franz, â€œwhat think you of the count of monte cristo?â€

â€œwhat do i think?â€ said albert, evidently surprised at such a question
from his companion; â€œi think he is a delightful fellow, who does the
honors of his table admirably; who has travelled much, read much, is,
like brutus, of the stoic school, and moreover,â€ added he, sending a
volume of smoke up towards the ceiling, â€œthat he has excellent cigars.â€
 such was albertâ€™s opinion of the count, and as franz well knew that
albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long r

pins, incited him to join in the general combat, in which all the masks
around him were engaged. he rose in his turn, and seizing handfuls of
confetti and sweetmeats, with which the carriage was filled, cast them
with all the force and skill he was master of.


the strife had fairly begun, and the recollection of what they had seen
half an hour before was gradually effaced from the young menâ€™s minds, so
much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they now
beheld.

as for the count of monte cristo, he had never for an instant shown any
appearance of having been moved. imagine the large and splendid corso,
bordered from one end to the other with lofty palaces, with their
balconies hung with carpets, and their windows with flags. at these
balconies are three hundred thousand spectators--romans, italians,
strangers from all parts of the world, the united aristocracy of birth,
wealth, and genius. lovely women, yielding to the influence of the
scene, bend over their balconies, or lean from th

he file on the corso broke the line,
and in a second all the carriages had disappeared. franz and albert were
opposite the via delle maratte; the coachman, without saying a word,
drove up it, passed along the piazza di spagna and the rospoli palace
and stopped at the door of the hotel. signor pastrini came to the door
to receive his guests.

franz hastened to inquire after the count, and to express regret that he
had not returned in sufficient time; but pastrini reassured him by
saying that the count of monte cristo had ordered a second carriage for
himself, and that it had gone at four oâ€™clock to fetch him from the
rospoli palace.

the count had, moreover, charged him to offer the two friends the key of
his box at the argentina. franz questioned albert as to his intentions;
but albert had great projects to put into execution before going to the
theatre; and instead of making any answer, he inquired if signor
pastrini could procure him a tailor.

â€œa tailor,â€ said the host; â€œand for what?â€

â€œto

portance to having tomorrow the
costumes we have asked for.â€

the host again assured them they might rely on him, and that their
wishes should be attended to; upon which franz and albert mounted to
their apartments, and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their
costumes. albert, as he took off his dress, carefully preserved the
bunch of violets; it was his token reserved for the morrow.

the two friends sat down to table; but they could not refrain from
remarking the difference between the count of monte cristoâ€™s table and
that of signor pastrini. truth compelled franz, in spite of the dislike
he seemed to have taken to the count, to confess that the advantage was
not on pastriniâ€™s side. during dessert, the servant inquired at what
time they wished for the carriage. albert and franz looked at each
other, fearing really to abuse the countâ€™s kindness. the servant
understood them.

orders that the carriage was to remain

 has a conclusion.â€

â€œvery well; i prefer complete histories; but tell me how you made his
acquaintance? did anyone introduce you to him?â€

â€œno; it was he who introduced himself to us.â€

â€œwhen?â€

â€œlast night, after we left you.â€

â€œthrough what medium?â€

â€œthe very prosaic one of our landlord.â€

â€œhe is staying, then, at the hÃ´tel de londres with you?â€

â€œnot only in the same hotel, but on the same floor.â€

â€œwhat is his name--for, of course, you know?â€

â€œthe count of monte cristo.â€

â€œthat is not a family name?â€

â€œno, it is the name of the island he has purchased.â€

â€œand he is a count?â€

â€œa tuscan count.â€

â€œwell, we must put up with that,â€ said the countess, who was herself
from one of the oldest venetian families. â€œwhat sort of a man is he?â€

â€œask the vicomte de morcerf.â€

â€œyou hear, m. de morcerf, i am referred to you,â€ said the countess.

â€œwe should be very hard to please, madam,â€ returned albert, â€œdid we not
think him delightfu

stream of ribbons, franz was forced to confess that costume has much to
do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations. the turks
used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes, but are
they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the chin, and
their red caps, which make them look like a bottle of wine with a red
seal? franz complimented albert, who looked at himself in the glass with
an unequivocal smile of satisfaction. they were thus engaged when the
count of monte cristo entered.


â€œgentlemen,â€ said he, â€œalthough a companion is agreeable, perfect
freedom is sometimes still more agreeable. i come to say that today, and
for the remainder of the carnival, i leave the carriage entirely at your
disposal. the host will tell you i have three or four more, so that you
will not inconvenience me in any way. make use of it, i pray you, for
your pleasure or your business.â€

the young men wished to decline, but they could find no good reason for
refusing an offer wh

always had a great taste for archÃ¦ology.â€


â€œcome, two or three more such adventures, and i do not despair of seeing
you a member of the academy.â€ doubtless albert was about to discuss
seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that
dinner was ready. albertâ€™s love had not taken away his appetite. he
hastened with franz to seat himself, free to recommence the discussion
after dinner. after dinner, the count of monte cristo was announced.
they had not seen him for two days. signor pastrini informed them that
business had called him to civita vecchia. he had started the previous
evening, and had only returned an hour since. he was charming. whether
he kept a watch over himself, or whether by accident he did not sound
the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched, he
was tonight like everybody else.

the man was an enigma to franz. the count must feel sure that franz
recognized him; and yet he

ter of credit, as he lived at florence, and had only come to rome to
pass seven or eight days; he had brought but a hundred louis, and of
these he had not more than fifty left. thus seven or eight hundred
piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that albert
required. true, he might in such a case rely on the kindness of signor
torlonia. he was, therefore, about to return to the palazzo bracciano
without loss of time, when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind. he
remembered the count of monte cristo. franz was about to ring for signor
pastrini, when that worthy presented himself.

â€œmy dear sir,â€ he said, hastily, â€œdo you know if the count is within?â€

â€œyes, your excellency; he has this moment returned.â€

â€œis he in bed?â€

â€œi should say no.â€

â€œthen ring at his door, if you please, and request him to be so kind as
to give me an audience.â€ signor pastrini did as he was desired, and
returning five minutes after, he said,

â€œthe count awaits your excellency.â€

he count went downstairs, accompanied by peppino. at the door
they found the carriage. ali was on the box, in whom franz recognized
the dumb slave of the grotto of monte cristo. franz and the count got
into the carriage. peppino placed himself beside ali, and they set off
at a rapid pace. ali had received his instructions, and went down the
corso, crossed the campo vaccino, went up the strada san gregorio, and
reached the gates of st. sebastian. then the porter raised some
difficulties, but the count of monte cristo produced a permit from the
governor of rome, allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of
the day or night; the portcullis was therefore raised, the porter had a
louis for his trouble, and they went on their way.

the road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient appian way,
and bordered with tombs. from time to time, by the light of the moon,
which began to rise, franz imagined that he saw something like a
sentinel appear at various points among the ruins, and suddenly retrea

yesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop; i am
rather late in claiming this gracious promise, but here is my friend,
whose character for veracity you well know, and he will assure you the
delay arose from no fault of mine.â€ and as at this moment the orchestra
gave the signal for the waltz, albert put his arm round the waist of the
countess, and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers. in the
meanwhile franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed
over the count of monte cristo at the moment when he had been, in some
sort, forced to give his hand to albert.



chapter 38. the compact

the first words that albert uttered to his friend, on the following
morning, contained a request that franz would accompany him on a visit
to the count; true, the young man had warmly and energetically thanked
the count on the previous evening; but services such as he had rendered
could never be too often acknowledged. franz, who seemed attracted by
some invisible influence towards the c

 society--would you have me refuse? my good fellow, you must have
lost your senses to think it possible i could act with such cold-blooded
policy.â€ and this time it must be confessed that, contrary to the usual
state of affairs in discussions between the young men, the effective
arguments were all on albertâ€™s side.

â€œwell,â€ said franz with a sigh, â€œdo as you please my dear viscount, for
your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation. still, in spite of
all, you must admit that this count of monte cristo is a most singular
personage.â€

â€œhe is a philanthropist,â€ answered the other; â€œand no doubt his motive
in visiting paris is to compete for the monthyon prize, given, as you
are aware, to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced
the interests of virtue and humanity. if my vote and interest can obtain
it for him, i will readily give him the one and promise the other. and
now, my dear franz, let us talk of something else. come, shall we take
our luncheon, and then pay a las

t visit to st. peterâ€™s?â€ franz silently
assented; and the following afternoon, at half-past five oâ€™clock, the
young men parted. albert de morcerf to return to paris, and franz
dâ€™epinay to pass a fortnight at venice. but, ere he entered his
travelling carriage, albert, fearing that his expected guest might
forget the engagement he had entered into, placed in the care of a
waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the count of monte cristo,
on which, beneath the name of vicomte albert de morcerf, he had written
in pencil:

â€œ27, _rue du helder, on the_ 21_st may, half-past ten_ a.m.â€



chapter 39. the guests

in the house in the rue du helder, where albert had invited the count of
monte cristo, everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st
of may to do honor to the occasion. albert de morcerf inhabited a
pavilion situated at the corner of a large court, and directly opposite
another building, in which were the serv

â€œah, this gentleman is a hercules killing cacus, a perseus freeing

â€œno, he is a man about my own size.â€

â€œarmed to the teeth?â€

â€œhe had not even a knitting-needle.â€

â€œbut he paid your ransom?â€

â€œhe said two words to the chief and i was free.â€

â€œand they apologized to him for having carried you off?â€ said beauchamp.

â€œjust so.â€

â€œwhy, he is a second ariosto.â€

â€œno, his name is the count of monte cristo.â€

â€œthere is no count of monte cristoâ€ said debray.

â€œi do not think so,â€ added chÃ¢teau-renaud, with the air of a man who
knows the whole of the european nobility perfectly.

â€œdoes anyone know anything of a count of monte cristo?â€

â€œhe comes possibly from the holy land, and one of his ancestors
possessed calvary, as the mortemarts did the dead sea.â€

â€œi think i can assist your researches,â€ said maximilian. â€œmonte cristo
is a little island i have often heard spoken of by

is rich, then?â€

â€œi believe so.â€

â€œbut that ought to be visible.â€

â€œthat is what deceives you, debray.â€

â€œi do not understand you.â€

â€œhave you read the _arabian nights_?â€

â€œwhat a question!â€

â€œwell, do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor, if
their sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds? they seem like poor
fishermen, and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with the
wealth of the indies.â€

â€œwhich means?â€

â€œwhich means that my count of monte cristo is one of those fishermen. he
has even a name taken from the book, since he calls himself sinbad the
sailor, and has a cave filled with gold.â€

â€œand you have seen this cavern, morcerf?â€ asked beauchamp.

â€œno, but franz has; for heavenâ€™s sake, not a word of this before him.
franz went in with his eyes blindfolded, and was waited on by mutes and
by women to whom cleopatra was a painted strumpet. only he is not quite
sure about the women, for they did not come in until after he had taken

â€œno, lest on the first demonstration i make in favor of mehemet ali, the
sultan send me the bowstring, and make my secretaries strangle me.â€

â€œyou say very true,â€ responded debray.

â€œyes,â€ said albert, â€œbut this has nothing to do with the existence of
the count of monte cristo.â€

â€œ_pardieu!_ everyone exists.â€

â€œdoubtless, but not in the same way; everyone has not black slaves, a
princely retinue, an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an
arabian fortress, horses that cost six thousand francs apiece, and greek
mistresses.â€

â€œhave you seen the greek mistress?â€

â€œi have both seen and heard her. i saw her at the theatre, and heard her

â€œhe eats, then?â€

â€œor, having delivered you, make you sign a flaming parchment,
surrendering your soul to him as esau did his birth-right?â€

â€œrail on, rail on at your ease, gentlemen,â€ said morcerf, somewhat
piqued. â€œwhen i look at you parisians, idlers on the boulevard de gand
or the bois de boulogne, and think of this man, it seems to me we are
not of the same race.â€

â€œi am highly flattered,â€ returned beauchamp.

â€œat the same time,â€ added chÃ¢teau-renaud, â€œyour count of monte cristo is
a very fine fellow, always excepting his little arrangements with the
italian banditti.â€

â€œthere are no italian banditti,â€ said debray.

â€œno vampire,â€ cried beauchamp.

â€œno count of monte cristoâ€ added debray. â€œthere is half-past ten
striking, albert.â€


â€œconfess you have dreamed this, and let us sit down to breakfast,â€
 continued beauchamp. but the sound of the clock had not died away when
germain announced, â€œhis excellency the count of monte cristo.â€ the

e with them be of any service to
you?â€

â€œoh, count, you could assist me perhaps in researches which have been,
up to the present, fruitless. this house, in past years, did ours a
great service, and has, i know not for what reason, always denied having
rendered us this service.â€

â€œi shall be at your orders,â€ said monte cristo bowing.

â€œbut,â€ continued morcerf, â€œ_Ã  propos_ of danglars,--we have strangely
wandered from the subject. we were speaking of a suitable habitation for
the count of monte cristo. come, gentlemen, let us all propose some
place. where shall we lodge this new guest in our great capital?â€

â€œfaubourg saint-germain,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud. â€œthe count will find
there a charming hotel, with a court and garden.â€

â€œbah, chÃ¢teau-renaud,â€ returned debray, â€œyou only know your dull and
gloomy faubourg saint-germain; do not pay any attention to him, count--
live in the chaussÃ©e dâ€™antin, thatâ€™s the real centre of paris.â€

â€œboulevard de lâ€™opÃ©ra,â€ said beau

enes have not much effect on sinbad the
sailor, who has seen so many others. however, accept what i propose to
you as an initiation into parisian life--a life of politeness, visiting,
and introductions.â€ monte cristo bowed without making any answer; he
accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret, as one of
those conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty.
albert summoned his servant, and ordered him to acquaint m. and madame
de morcerf of the arrival of the count of monte cristo. albert followed
him with the count. when they arrived at the antechamber, above the door
was visible a shield, which, by its rich ornaments and its harmony with
the rest of the furniture, indicated the importance the owner attached
to this blazon. monte cristo stopped and examined it attentively.

â€œazure seven merlets, or, placed bender,â€ said he. â€œthese are,
doubtless, your family arms? except the knowledge of blazons, that
enables me to decipher them, i am very ignorant of heraldry--i,

with his almost white
hair, which was cut short, in the military fashion. he was dressed in
plain clothes, and wore at his button-hole the ribbons of the different
orders to which he belonged. he entered with a tolerably dignified step,
and some little haste. monte cristo saw him advance towards him without
making a single step. it seemed as if his feet were rooted to the
ground, and his eyes on the count of morcerf. â€œfather,â€ said the young
man, â€œi have the honor of presenting to you the count of monte cristo,
the generous friend whom i had the good fortune to meet in the critical
situation of which i have told you.â€

â€œyou are most welcome, monsieur,â€ said the count of morcerf, saluting
monte cristo with a smile, â€œand monsieur has rendered our house, in
preserving its only heir, a service which insures him our eternal
gratitude.â€ as he said these words, the count of morcerf pointed to a
chair, while he seated himself in another opposite the window.

and we pursue the same lines, and often the same uselessness, all our
lives.â€


â€œbut, monsieur,â€ said the count of morcerf, â€œfor a man of your merit,
italy is not a country, and france opens her arms to receive you;
respond to her call. france will not, perhaps, be always ungrateful. she
treats her children ill, but she always welcomes strangers.â€

â€œah, father,â€ said albert with a smile, â€œit is evident you do not know
the count of monte cristo; he despises all honors, and contents himself
with those written on his passport.â€

â€œthat is the most just remark,â€ replied the stranger, â€œi ever heard made
concerning myself.â€

â€œyou have been free to choose your career,â€ observed the count of
morcerf, with a sigh; â€œand you have chosen the path strewed with

stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left madame de

â€œyou say----â€

â€œi say that monte cristo is an island in the midst of the mediterranean,
without inhabitants or garrison, the resort of smugglers of all nations,
and pirates of every flag. who knows whether or not these industrious
worthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues for his protection?â€

â€œthat is possible,â€ said the countess, reflecting.

â€œnever mind,â€ continued the young man, â€œsmuggler or not, you must agree,
mother dear, as you have seen him, that the count of monte cristo is a
remarkable man, who will have the greatest success in the salons of
paris. why, this very morning, in my rooms, he made his _entrÃ©e_ amongst
us by striking every man of us with amazement, not even excepting
chÃ¢teau-renaud.â€

â€œand what do you suppose is the countâ€™s age?â€ inquired mercÃ©dÃ¨s,
evidently attaching great importance to this question.

him with the utmost precaution. â€œthis devil of a fellow,â€ he muttered,
shaking his head; â€œi said at the time he would create a sensation here,
and i measure his effect by an infallible thermometer. my mother has
noticed him, and he must therefore, perforce, be remarkable.â€ he went
down to the stables, not without some slight annoyance, when he
remembered that the count of monte cristo had laid his hands on a
â€œturnoutâ€ which sent his bays down to second place in the opinion of
connoisseurs. â€œmost decidedly,â€ said he, â€œmen are not equal, and i must
beg my father to develop this theorem in the chamber of peers.â€

minutes to perform the distance, but these six minutes were sufficient
to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had

making the tour of the garden a second time, the count re-entered his
carriage, while bertuccio, who perceived the thoughtful expression of
his masterâ€™s features, took his seat beside the driver without uttering
a word. the carriage proceeded rapidly towards paris.

that same evening, upon reaching his abode in the champs-Ã©lysÃ©es, the
count of monte cristo went over the whole building with the air of one
long acquainted with each nook or corner. nor, although preceding the
party, did he once mistake one door for another, or commit the smallest
error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him
to a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit. ali was his principal
attendant during this nocturnal survey. having given various orders to

eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so
little did its jetty glossiness assimilate with the deep wrinkles
stamped on his features--a person, in a word, who, although evidently
past fifty, desired to be taken for not more than forty, bent forwards
from the carriage door, on the panels of which were emblazoned the
armorial bearings of a baron, and directed his groom to inquire at the
porterâ€™s lodge whether the count of monte cristo resided there, and if
he were within. while waiting, the occupant of the carriage surveyed the
house, the garden as far as he could distinguish it, and the livery of
servants who passed to and fro, with an attention so close as to be
somewhat impertinent. his glance was keen but showed cunning rather than
intelligence; his lips were straight, and so thin that, as they closed,
they were drawn in over the teeth; his cheek-bones were broad and
projecting, a never-failing proof of audacity and craf

much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears, combined
to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing, save in the eyes of
such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs
be all that was admirable and enviable, more especially when they gazed
on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt, and the red ribbon
that depended from his button-hole.

the groom, in obedience to his orders, tapped at the window of the
porterâ€™s lodge, saying, â€œpray, does not the count of monte cristo live
here?â€

â€œhis excellency does reside here,â€ replied the concierge; â€œbut----â€
 added he, glancing an inquiring look at ali. ali returned a sign in the
negative.

â€œbut what?â€ asked the groom.

â€œhis excellency does not receive visitors today.â€

â€œthen here is my masterâ€™s card,--the baron danglars. you will take it to
the count, and say that, although in haste to attend the chamber, my
master came out of his way to have the honor of calling upon him.â€

â€œand for that reason i did myself the honor of calling upon you, in
order to beg for an explanation.â€

â€œgo on, monsieur. here i am, ready to give you any explanation you
desire.â€

â€œwhy,â€ said danglars, â€œin the letter--i believe i have it about meâ€--

â€œmerely the term _unlimited_--nothing else, certainly.â€

germans, you know.â€

â€œoh, as for the composition of the letter, there is nothing to be said;
but as regards the competency of the document, i certainly have doubts.â€

threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that i have been the

baroness evidently regretted parting with them, i ventured to send them
back to her, with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them
from my hands.â€


â€œyou are, then, doubtless, the count of monte cristo, of whom hermine
has talked to me so much?â€

â€œyou have rightly guessed, madame,â€ replied the count.

â€œand i am madame hÃ©loÃ¯se de villefort.â€ the count bowed with the air of
a person who hears a name for the first time. â€œhow grateful will m. de
villefort be for all your goodness; how thankfully will he acknowledge
that to you alone he owes the existence of his wife and child! most

imminent danger, and i owe my safety to the very count of monte cristo
we were talking about yesterday, but whom i little expected to see
today. i remember how unmercifully i laughed at what i considered your
eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him; but i have now ample cause to
admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far
short of his merits. your horses got as far as ranelagh, when they

after all, i ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses,

count of monte cristo,--and certainly that illustrious personage, apart
from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of, seemed
to me one of those curiously interesting problems i, for one, delight in
solving at any risk, even if it were to necessitate another drive to the

chapter 48. ideology

if the count of monte cristo had been for a long time familiar with the
ways of parisian society, he would have appreciated better the
significance of the step which m. de villefort had taken. standing well
at court, whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch,
whether the government was doctrinaire liberal, or conservative; looked
upon by all as a man of talent, since those who have never experienced a
political check are generally so regarded; hated by many, but warmly
supported by others, without being r

h he appeared for a quarter of
an hour only,--that is to say, five and forty minutes less than the king
is visible at his balls. he was never seen at the theatres, at concerts,
or in any place of public resort. occasionally, but seldom, he played at
whist, and then care was taken to select partners worthy of him--
sometimes they were ambassadors, sometimes archbishops, or sometimes a
prince, or a president, or some dowager duchess. such was the man whose
carriage had just now stopped before the count of monte cristoâ€™s door.
the valet de chambre announced m. de villefort at the moment when the
count, leaning over a large table, was tracing on a map the route from
st. petersburg to china.

the procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would
have employed in entering a court of justice. he was the same man, or
rather the development of the same man, whom we have heretofore seen as
assistant attorney at marseilles. nature, according to her way, had made
no deviation in the path he had marked

ers an undoubtedly great honor; for
i am aware that m. de villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which
he now bestows on me,--a favor which, however estimable, is unequal to
the satisfaction which i have in my own consciousness.â€ villefort,
astonished at this reply, which he by no means expected, started like a
soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears, and
a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in
the tablets of his brain that the count of monte cristo was by no means
a highly bred gentleman. he glanced around, in order to seize on
something on which the conversation might turn, and seemed to fall
easily on a topic. he saw the map which monte cristo had been examining
when he entered, and said, â€œyou seem geographically engaged, sir? it is
a rich study for you, who, as i learn, have seen as many lands as are
delineated on this map.â€

â€œyes, sir,â€ replied the count; â€œi have sought to make of the human race,
taken in the mass, what you

, the procureur being
escorted to his carriage by two footmen, who, on a signal from their
master, followed him with every mark of attention. when he had gone,
monte cristo breathed a profound sigh, and said,--â€œenough of this
poison, let me now seek the antidote.â€ then sounding his bell, he said
to ali, who entered, â€œi am going to madamâ€™s chamber--have the carriage
ready at one oâ€™clock.â€



chapter 49. haydÃ©e

it will be recollected that the new, or rather old, acquaintances of the
count of monte cristo, residing in the rue meslay, were no other than
maximilian, julie, and emmanuel. the very anticipations of delight to be
enjoyed in his forthcoming visits--the bright, pure gleam of heavenly
happiness it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had
voluntarily engaged, illumined his whole countenance with a look of
ineffable joy and calmness, as, immediately after villefortâ€™s departure,
his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him, of tasting,
at least, a brief respit

y was set apart for
maximilian; it was precisely similar to his sisterâ€™s apartments, except
that for the breakfast-parlor he had a billiard-room, where he received
his friends. he was superintending the grooming of his horse, and
smoking his cigar at the entrance of the garden, when the countâ€™s
carriage stopped at the gate.

cocles opened the gate, and baptistin, springing from the box, inquired
whether monsieur and madame herbault and monsieur maximilian morrel
would see his excellency the count of monte cristo. â€œthe count of monte
cristo?â€ cried morrel, throwing away his cigar and hastening to the
carriage; â€œi should think we would see him. ah, a thousand thanks,
count, for not having forgotten your promise.â€ and the young officer
shook the countâ€™s hand so warmly, that monte cristo could not be
mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy, and he saw that he had been
expected with impatience, and was received with pleasure. â€œcome, come,â€

watch like a man who has forgotten the hour, said a few hurried words to
madame herbault, and pressing the hands of emmanuel and maximilian,--
â€œmadame,â€ said he, â€œi trust you will allow me to visit you occasionally;
i value your friendship, and feel grateful to you for your welcome, for
this is the first time for many years that i have thus yielded to my
feelings;â€ and he hastily quitted the apartment.

â€œthis count of monte cristo is a strange man,â€ said emmanuel.

â€œyes,â€ answered maximilian, â€œbut i feel sure he has an excellent heart,
and that he likes us.â€

â€œhis voice went to my heart,â€ observed julie; â€œand two or three times i
fancied that i had heard it before.â€

â€œsome grand personage--a prince i believe they said--the count of monte

â€œi will come directly,â€ cried valentine aloud. the name of monte cristo
sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the
iron gate, to whom valentineâ€™s _â€œi am comingâ€_ was the customary signal
of farewell. â€œnow, then,â€ said maximilian, leaning on the handle of his
spade, â€œi would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the
count of monte cristo is acquainted with m. de villefort.â€



chapter 52. toxicology

it was really the count of monte cristo who had just arrived at madame
de villefortâ€™s for the purpose of returning the procureurâ€™s visit, and
at his name, as may be easily imagined, the whole house was in
confusion. madame de villefort, who was alone in her drawing-room when
the count was announced, desired that her son might be brought thither
instantly to renew his thanks to the count; and edward, who heard this

â€œwhy,â€ said albert, â€œhe was talked about for a week; then the coronation
of the queen of england took place, followed by the theft of
mademoiselle marsâ€™s diamonds; and so people talked of something else.â€

â€œmy good fellow,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud, â€œthe count is your friend and you
treat him accordingly. do not believe what albert is telling you,
countess; so far from the sensation excited in the parisian circles by
the appearance of the count of monte cristo having abated, i take upon
myself to declare that it is as strong as ever. his first astounding act
upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses, worth 32,000
francs, to madame danglars; his second, the almost miraculous
preservation of madame de villefortâ€™s life; now it seems that he has
carried off the prize awarded by the jockey club. i therefore maintain,
in spite of morcerf, that not only is the count the object of interest
at this present moment, but also that he will continue

â€œis that she, mamma?â€ asked eugÃ©nie; â€œalmost opposite to us, with that

â€œwhat for? why, to converse with him, of course. have you really no
desire to meet him?â€

â€œnone whatever,â€ replied eugÃ©nie.

salute in the most smiling and graceful manner.

an introduction to your daughter?â€

â€œoh, you are no stranger--at least not by name,â€ replied madame
danglars, â€œand the last two or three days we have really talked of
nothing but you. eugÃ©nie,â€ continued the baroness, turning towards her
daughter, â€œthis is the count of monte cristo.â€ the count bowed, while
mademoiselle danglars bent her head slightly. â€œyou have a charming young
person with you tonight, count,â€ said eugÃ©nie. â€œis she your daughter?â€

â€œno, mademoiselle,â€ said monte cristo, astonished at the coolness and
freedom of the question. â€œshe is a poor unfortunate greek left under my
care.â€

â€œand what is her name?â€

â€œhaydÃ©e,â€ replied monte cristo.

you--i am calculating what the house of danglars must have gained by the

and the prudent banker had purchased at 206; therefore he must have made
300,000 livres.â€

â€œthat is not his biggest scoop,â€ said morcerf; â€œdid he not make a

moustaches, caused him to be easily recognized by baptistin, who had

pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival. he was

your lost andrea.â€ saying which monte cristo bowed, and disappeared
behind the tapestry, leaving the major fascinated beyond expression with
the delightful reception which he had received at the hands of the
count.

the count of monte cristo entered the adjoining room, which baptistin
had designated as the drawing-room, and found there a young man, of
graceful demeanor and elegant appearance, who had arrived in a cab about
half an hour previously. baptistin had not found any difficulty in
recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for admittance.

words with a bow.

at first sight, the exterior of the house at auteuil gave no indications
of splendor, nothing one would expect from the destined residence of the
magnificent count of monte cristo; but this simplicity was according to
the will of its master, who positively ordered nothing to be altered
outside. the splendor was within. indeed, almost before the door opened,
the scene changed. m. bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste
displayed in furnishing, and in the rapidity with which it was executed.

severely; â€œi ordered dinner at that hour, and i do not like to wait;â€
 and he returned to his guests, while bertuccio, leaning against the
wall, succeeded in reaching the dining-room. five minutes afterwards the
doors of the drawing-room were thrown open, and bertuccio appearing
said, with a violent effort, â€œthe dinner waits.â€

the count of monte cristo offered his arm to madame de villefort. â€œm. de
villefort,â€ he said, â€œwill you conduct the baroness danglars?â€

villefort complied, and they passed on to the dining-room.



chapter 63. the dinner

it was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering
the dining-room. each one asked what strange influence had brought them
to this house, and yet astonished, even uneasy though they were, they
still felt that they would not like to be absent. the recent events, the

â€œwhy do you wish to know?â€ asked cavalcanti.

â€œwhat? do you again defy me?â€

â€œno; the fact is, i have found my father.â€

â€œwhat? a real father?â€

â€œyes, so long as he pays me----â€

â€œyouâ€™ll honor and believe him--thatâ€™s right. what is his name?â€

â€œmajor cavalcanti.â€

â€œis he pleased with you?â€

â€œso far i have appeared to answer his purpose.â€

â€œand who found this father for you?â€

â€œthe count of monte cristo.â€

â€œthe man whose house you have just left?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œi wish you would try and find me a situation with him as grandfather,
since he holds the money-chest!â€

â€œwell, i will mention you to him. meanwhile, what are you going to do?â€

â€œi?â€

â€œyes, you.â€

â€œit is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me.â€

ask you some questions.â€

depths of the tomb and the recesses of our hearts, where it was buried,
to visit us now, like a phantom, whitening our cheeks and flushing our
brows with shame?â€

â€œalas,â€ said hermine, â€œdoubtless it is chance.â€

â€œchance?â€ replied villefort; â€œno, no, madame, there is no such thing as
chance.â€

â€œoh, yes; has not a fatal chance revealed all this? was it not by chance
the count of monte cristo bought that house? was it not by chance he
caused the earth to be dug up? is it not by chance that the unfortunate
child was disinterred under the trees?--that poor innocent offspring of
mine, which i never even kissed, but for whom i wept many, many tears.
ah, my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear spoil found
beneath the flowers.â€

villefort in a hollow voice--â€œno, nothing was found beneath the flo

â€œand you stopped there?â€

â€œoh, no,â€ said villefort; â€œi never ceased to search and to inquire.
however, the last two or three years i had allowed myself some respite.
but now i will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever, since
fear urges me, not my conscience.â€

â€œbut,â€ replied madame danglars, â€œthe count of monte cristo can know
nothing, or he would not seek our society as he does.â€

â€œoh, the wickedness of man is very great,â€ said villefort, â€œsince it
surpasses the goodness of god. did you observe that manâ€™s eyes while he
was speaking to us?â€

â€œno.â€

â€œbut have you ever watched him carefully?â€

â€œdoubtless he is capricious, but that is all; one thing alone struck
me,--of all the exquisite things he placed before us, he touched
nothing. i might have suspected he was poisoning us.â€

quest of the little estate i spoke to you of in normandy.â€ bertuccio
bowed, and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order he had
received, he started the same evening.



chapter 69. the inquiry

m. de villefort kept the promise he had made to madame danglars, to
endeavor to find out how the count of monte cristo had discovered the
history of the house at auteuil. he wrote the same day for the required
information to m. de boville, who, from having been an inspector of
prisons, was promoted to a high office in the police; and the latter
begged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely
to give him full particulars. at the end of the second day m. de
villefort received the following note:--

â€œthe person called the count of monte cristo is an intimate acquaintance
of lord wilmore, a

â€œone only.â€

â€œwhat is his name?â€

â€œlord wilmore.â€

â€œwhere is he?â€

â€œhe is in paris just now.â€

â€œcan he give me any particulars?â€

â€œimportant ones; he was in india with zaccone.â€

â€œdo you know his abode?â€

â€œitâ€™s somewhere in the chaussÃ©e dâ€™antin; but i know neither the street
nor the number.â€


â€œare you at variance with the englishman?â€

â€œi love zaccone, and he hates him; we are consequently not friends.â€

â€œdo you think the count of monte cristo had ever been in france before
he made this visit to paris?â€

â€œto that question i can answer positively; no, sir, he had not, because
he applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required, and as
i did not know when i might again come to paris, i recommended m.
cavalcanti to him.â€

â€œandrea?â€

â€œno, bartolomeo, his father.â€

name of honor, of humanity, and of religion, to answer me candidly.â€

baroness, smiling.

â€œi confess it,â€ replied albert. â€œcould you have been so cruel as not to
bring her?â€

â€œcalm yourself. she has met mademoiselle de villefort, and has taken her
arm; see, they are following us, both in white dresses, one with a
bouquet of camellias, the other with one of myosotis. but tell me----â€

â€œwell, what do you wish to know?â€

â€œwill not the count of monte cristo be here tonight?â€

â€œseventeen!â€ replied albert.

â€œwhat do you mean?â€

â€œi only mean that the count seems the rage,â€ replied the viscount,
smiling, â€œand that you are the seventeenth person that has asked me the
same question. the count is in fashion; i congratulate him upon it.â€

â€œand have you replied to everyone as you have to me?â€

â€œwait; leave me here, and go and speak to madame de villefort, who is

albert bowed to madame danglars, and advanced towards madame de

albert, interrupting her, â€œthat i know what you were about to say.â€

â€œwell, what is it?â€

â€œif i guess rightly, will you confess it?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œon your honor?â€

â€œon my honor.â€

â€œyou were going to ask me if the count of monte cristo had arrived, or
was expected.â€

â€œnot at all. it is not of him that i am now thinking. i was going to ask
you if you had received any news of monsieur franz.â€

â€œyes,--yesterday.â€

â€œwhat did he tell you?â€

â€œthat he was leaving at the same time as his letter.â€

â€œwell, now then, the count?â€

â€œthe count will come, of that you may be satisfied.â€

just then, a handsome young man, with bright eyes, black hair, and
glossy moustache, respectfully bowed to madame de villefort. albert
extended his hand. â€œmadame,â€ said albert, â€œallow me to present to you m.
maximilian morrel, captain of spahis, one of our best, and, above all,
of our bravest officers.â€

â€œi have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at auteuil,
at the house of the count of monte cristo,â€ replied madame de villefort,
turning away with marked coldness of manner. this answer, and especially
the tone in which it was uttered, chilled the heart of poor morrel. but
a recompense was in store for him; turning around, he saw near the door
a beautiful fair face, whose large blue eyes were, without any marked
expression, fixed upon him, while the bouquet of myosotis was gently
raised to her lips.

the salutation was so well understood that morrel, with the same

â€œand you think she would be angry?â€

â€œno, certainly not,â€ said the count with a haughty expression.

â€œshe is very amiable, then, is she not?â€ said albert.

â€œit is not to be called amiability, it is her duty; a slave does not
dictate to a master.â€

â€œcome; you are joking yourself now. are there any more slaves to be had
who bear this beautiful name?â€

â€œundoubtedly.â€

â€œreally, count, you do nothing, and have nothing like other people. the
slave of the count of monte cristo! why, it is a rank of itself in
france, and from the way in which you lavish money, it is a place that
must be worth a hundred thousand francs a year.â€

â€œa hundred thousand francs! the poor girl originally possessed much more
than that; she was born to treasures in comparison with which those
recorded in the _thousand and one nights_ would seem but poverty.â€

â€œshe must be a princess then.â€

â€œyou are right; and she is one of the greatest in her country too.â€

â€œmagnificent windows, so beautiful, so large, that i believe a man of
your size should pass through each frame.â€

â€œwhy the devil have they any stairs with such windows?â€

â€œluxury has everything.â€

â€œbut shutters?â€

â€œyes, but they are never used. that count of monte cristo is an
original, who loves to look at the sky even at night.â€

â€œand where do the servants sleep?â€

â€œoh, they have a house to themselves. picture to yourself a pretty
coach-house at the right-hand side where the ladders are kept. well,
over that coach-house are the servantsâ€™ rooms, with bells corresponding
with the different apartments.â€

chapter 82. the burglary

the day following that on which the conversation we have related took
place, the count of monte cristo set out for auteuil, accompanied by ali
and several attendants, and also taking with him some horses whose
qualities he was desirous of ascertaining. he was induced to undertake
this journey, of which the day before he had not even thought and which
had not occurred to andrea either, by the arrival of bertuccio from
normandy with intelligence respecting the house and sloop. the house was
ready, and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a
small creek with her crew of six men

caderousse, fixing his haggard gaze on the count.

â€œyes, undoubtedly, the abbÃ© busoni himself,â€ replied monte cristo. â€œand
i am very glad you recognize me, dear m. caderousse; it proves you have
a good memory, for it must be about ten years since we last met.â€ this
calmness of busoni, combined with his irony and boldness, staggered
caderousse.

â€œthe abbÃ©, the abbÃ©!â€ murmured he, clenching his fists, and his teeth
chattering.

â€œso you would rob the count of monte cristo?â€ continued the false abbÃ©.

â€œreverend sir,â€ murmured caderousse, seeking to regain the window, which
the count pitilessly blocked--â€œreverend sir, i donâ€™t know--believe me--i
take my oath----â€

â€œa pane of glass out,â€ continued the count, â€œa dark lantern, a bunch of
false keys, a secretary desk half forced--it is tolerably evident----â€

caderousse was choking; he looked around for some corner to hide in,
some way of escape.

â€œsince you left toulon what have you lived on? answer me!â€

tone. caderousse, terrified, looked at the count. â€œyou have lived on the
money he has given you.â€

â€œtrue,â€ said caderousse; â€œbenedetto has become the son of a great lord.â€

â€œhow can he be the son of a great lord?â€

â€œa natural son.â€

â€œand what is that great lordâ€™s name?â€

â€œthe count of monte cristo, the very same in whose house we are.â€

â€œbenedetto the countâ€™s son?â€ replied monte cristo, astonished in his
turn.

â€œwell, i should think so, since the count has found him a false father--
since the count gives him four thousand francs a month, and leaves him
500,000 francs in his will.â€

â€œah, yes,â€ said the factitious abbÃ©, who began to understand; â€œand what

the arabic language, having studied it during the famous egyptian
campaign, followed with his eye as the translator read aloud:--

christian slave of eleven years of age, named haydÃ©e, the acknowledged
daughter of the late lord ali tepelini, pasha of yanina, and of
vasiliki, his favorite; she having been sold to me seven years
previously, with her mother, who had died on arriving at constantinople,
by a french colonel in the service of the vizier ali tepelini, named

imperial seal, which the vendor is bound to have affixed to it.â€™

â€œnear the merchantâ€™s signature there was, indeed, the seal of the
sublime emperor. a dreadful silence followed the reading of this
document; the count could only stare, and his gaze, fixed as if
unconsciously on haydÃ©e, seemed one of fire and blood. â€˜madame,â€™ said
the president, â€˜may reference be made to the count of monte cristo, who
is now, i believe, in paris?â€™--â€˜sir,â€™ replied haydÃ©e, â€˜the count of

â€œâ€˜who, then, has counselled you to take this step, one for which the
court is deeply indebted to you, and which is perfectly natural,

letter, which the fisherman fernand himself posted.â€

monte cristo went to a secretary desk, opened a drawer by a spring, from
which he took a paper which had lost its original color, and the ink of
which had become of a rusty hue--this he placed in the hands of
mercÃ©dÃ¨s. it was danglarsâ€™ letter to the kingâ€™s attorney, which the
count of monte cristo, disguised as a clerk from the house of thomson &
french, had taken from the file against edmond dantÃ¨s, on the day he had
paid the two hundred thousand francs to m. de boville. mercÃ©dÃ¨s read
with terror the following lines:--

â€œthe kingâ€™s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion

â€œm. morrel,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud, â€œwill you apprise the count of monte
cristo that m. de morcerf is arrived, and we are at his disposal?â€
 morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission. beauchamp had meanwhile
drawn the box of pistols from the carriage. â€œstop, gentlemen,â€ said
albert; â€œi have two words to say to the count of monte cristo.â€

â€œin private?â€ asked morrel.

â€œno, sir; before all who are here.â€

albertâ€™s witnesses looked at each other. franz and debray exchanged some
words in a whisper, and morrel, rejoiced at this unexpected incident,
went to fetch the count, who was walking in a retired path with
emmanuel. â€œwhat does he want with me?â€ said monte cristo.

â€œi do not know, but he wishes to speak to you.â€

â€œah?â€ said monte cristo, â€œi trust he is not going to tempt me by some
fresh insult!â€

should entertain a false opinion of me,â€ added he, drawing himself up as
if he would challenge both friends and enemies, â€œi shall endeavor to
correct his mistake.â€

â€œwhat happened during the night?â€ asked beauchamp of chÃ¢teau-renaud; â€œwe
appear to make a very sorry figure here.â€

â€œin truth, what albert has just done is either very despicable or very
noble,â€ replied the baron.

â€œwhat can it mean?â€ said debray to franz. â€œthe count of monte cristo
acts dishonorably to m. de morcerf, and is justified by his son! had i
ten yaninas in my family, i should only consider myself the more bound
to fight ten times.â€ as for monte cristo, his head was bent down, his
arms were powerless. bowing under the weight of twenty-four yearsâ€™
reminiscences, he thought not of albert, of beauchamp, of chÃ¢teau-
renaud, or of any of that group; but he thought of that courageous woman
who had come to plead for her sonâ€™s life, to whom he had offered his,

chapter 91. mother and son

the count of monte cristo bowed to the five young men with a melancholy
and dignified smile, and got into his carriage with maximilian and
emmanuel. albert, beauchamp, and chÃ¢teau-renaud remained alone. albert
looked at his two friends, not timidly, but in a way that appeared to
ask their opinion of what he had just done.

â€œindeed, my dear friend,â€ said beauchamp first, who had either the most
feeling or the least dissimulation, â€œallow me to congratulate you; this

â€œwell!â€ said albert.

â€œi did not like to go to him without first seeing you.â€

â€œwhy?â€

â€œbecause the count is doubtless aware that i accompanied you to the
meeting this morning.â€

â€œit is probable,â€ said albert.

â€œand since he has sent for me, it is doubtless to question me on what
happened there. what must i answer?â€

â€œthe truth.â€

â€œthen i shall say the duel did not take place?â€

â€œyou will say i apologized to the count of monte cristo. go.â€

the valet bowed and retired, and albert returned to his inventory. as he
was finishing this work, the sound of horses prancing in the yard, and
the wheels of a carriage shaking his window, attracted his attention. he
approached the window, and saw his father get into it, and drive away.
the door was scarcely closed when albert bent his steps to his motherâ€™s
room; and, no one being there to announce him, he advanced to her
bedchamber, and distressed by what he saw and guessed, stopped

general morcerf was seen on the steps in a black
coat with a military collar, black pantaloons, and black gloves. he had
apparently given previous orders, for as he reached the bottom step his
carriage came from the coach-house ready for him. the valet threw into
the carriage his military cloak, in which two swords were wrapped, and,
shutting the door, he took his seat by the side of the coachman. the
coachman stooped down for his orders.

stopped before the countâ€™s door. m. de morcerf opened the door himself,
and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk, rang, and entered
the open door with his servant.

a moment afterwards, baptistin announced the count of morcerf to monte
cristo, and the latter, leading haydÃ©e aside, ordered that morcerf be
asked into the drawing-room. the general was pacing the room the third
time when, in turning, he per

the count of monte cristo turned dreadfully pale; his eye seemed to burn
with a devouring fire. he leaped towards a dressing-room near his
bedroom, and in less than a moment, tearing off his cravat, his coat and
waistcoat, he put on a sailorâ€™s jacket and hat, from beneath which
rolled his long black hair. he returned thus, formidable and implacable,
advancing with his arms crossed on his breast, towards the general, who
could not understand why he had disappeared, but who on seeing him

â€œand pray what may it be?â€

â€œwell, to take his part.â€

â€œah, my dear sir! what?--after the varied relations i have had the
happiness to sustain towards you, can it be that you know me so little
as to ask such a thing? ask me to lend you half a million and, although
such a loan is somewhat rare, on my honor, you would annoy me less!
know, then, what i thought i had already told you, that in participation
in this worldâ€™s affairs, more especially in their moral aspects, the
count of monte cristo has never ceased to entertain the scruples and
even the superstitions of the east. i, who have a seraglio at cairo, one
at smyrna, and one at constantinople, preside at a wedding?--never!â€

â€œthen you refuse me?â€

â€œdecidedly; and were you my son or my brother i would refuse you in the
same way.â€

â€œbut what must be done?â€ said andrea, disappointed.

ment, respected in the army, or illustrious
in the literary world, and which was acknowledged by a slight movement
in the different groups. but for one whose privilege it was to agitate
that ocean of human waves, how many were received with a look of
indifference or a sneer of disdain! at the moment when the hand of the
massive time-piece, representing endymion asleep, pointed to nine on its
golden face, and the hammer, the faithful type of mechanical thought,
struck nine times, the name of the count of monte cristo resounded in
its turn, and as if by an electric shock all the assembly turned towards
the door.


the count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity; his
white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock
was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly
paleness of his face. his only jewellery was a chain, so fine that the
slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat. a
circle was immediately formed around the door. the c

the baron was to sign first, then the representative of m. cavalcanti,
senior, then the baroness, afterwards the â€œfuture couple,â€ as they are
styled in the abominable phraseology of legal documents. the baron took
the pen and signed, then the representative. the baroness approached,
leaning on madame de villefortâ€™s arm. â€œmy dear,â€ said she, as she took
the pen, â€œis it not vexatious? an unexpected incident, in the affair of
murder and theft at the count of monte cristoâ€™s, in which he nearly fell
a victim, deprives us of the pleasure of seeing m. de villefort.â€

â€œindeed?â€ said m. danglars, in the same tone in which he would have
said, â€œoh, well, what do i care?â€

â€œas a matter of fact,â€ said monte cristo, approaching, â€œi am much afraid
that i am the involuntary cause of his absence.â€

â€œwhat, you, count?â€ said madame danglars, signing; â€œif you are, take
care, for i shall never forgive you.â€ andrea pricked up his ears.

â€œbut who then is andrea cavalcanti?â€ asked danglars in amazement.

â€œa galley-slave, escaped from confinement at toulon.â€

â€œand what crime has he committed?â€

â€œhe is accused,â€ said the commissary with his inflexible voice, â€œof
having assassinated the man named caderousse, his former companion in
prison, at the moment he was making his escape from the house of the
count of monte cristo.â€ monte cristo cast a rapid glance around him.
andrea was gone.



chapter 97. the departure for belgium

a few minutes after the scene of confusion produced in the salons of m.
danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers, and by
the disclosure which had followed, the mansion was deserted with as much
rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken out
among the guests. in a few minutes, through all the doors, down all the

ment of which we speak pursued valentine even in her
sleep, or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking
hours; it was then, in the silence of night, in the dim light shed from
the alabaster lamp on the chimney-piece, that she saw the shadows pass
and repass which hover over the bed of sickness, and fan the fever with
their trembling wings. first she fancied she saw her stepmother
threatening her, then morrel stretched his arms towards her; sometimes
mere strangers, like the count of monte cristo came to visit her; even
the very furniture, in these moments of delirium, seemed to move, and
this state lasted till about three oâ€™clock in the morning, when a deep,
heavy slumber overcame the young girl, from which she did not awake till
daylight. on the evening of the day on which valentine had learned of
the flight of eugÃ©nie and the arrest of benedetto,--villefort having
retired as well as noirtier and dâ€™avrigny,--her thoughts wandered in a
confused maze, alternately reviewing her own

the grating against the library-door aroused the young girl from the
stupor in which she was plunged, and which almost amounted to
insensibility. she raised her head with an effort. the noiseless door
again turned on its hinges, and the count of monte cristo reappeared.
â€œwell,â€ said he, â€œdo you still doubt?â€

â€œoh,â€ murmured the young girl.

â€œhave you seen?â€

â€œalas!â€

â€œdid you recognize?â€ valentine groaned. â€œoh, yes;â€ she said, â€œi saw, but
i cannot believe!â€

â€œwould you rather die, then, and cause maximilianâ€™s death?â€

â€œoh,â€ repeated the young girl, almost bewildered, â€œcan i not leave the
house?--can i not escape?â€

â€œit has been mentioned, but the article is not mine; indeed, i doubt if
it will please m. villefort, for it says that if four successive deaths
had happened anywhere else than in the house of the kingâ€™s attorney, he
would have interested himself somewhat more about it.â€

â€œstill,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud, â€œdr. dâ€™avrigny, who attends my mother,
declares he is in despair about it. but whom are you seeking, debray?â€

â€œi am seeking the count of monte cristoâ€ said the young man.

â€œi met him on the boulevard, on my way here,â€ said beauchamp. â€œi think
he is about to leave paris; he was going to his banker.â€

â€œhis banker? danglars is his banker, is he not?â€ asked chÃ¢teau-renaud of
debray.

â€œi believe so,â€ replied the secretary with slight uneasiness. â€œbut monte

â€œyes; you tell me to lay aside the mask, and i will do so, be satisfied!
when you spoke to me at the cemetery, i answered you--my heart was

abuse my confidence, since you have devised a new torture after i

guardian, be satisfied, you shall witness the death of your friend;â€ and
morrel, with a maniacal laugh, again rushed towards the pistols.

â€œand i again repeat, you shall not commit suicide.â€


â€œprevent me, then!â€ replied morrel, with another struggle, which, like
the first, failed in releasing him from the countâ€™s iron grasp.

â€œi will prevent you.â€

dropped his head with disdainful incredulity.

remedy i propose, and only ask you to permit me to assure you of its
efficacy.â€

â€œcount, you prolong my agony.â€

â€œthen,â€ said the count, â€œyour feeble spirit will not even grant me the
trial i request? come--do you know of what the count of monte cristo is
capable? do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control?
nay, that he can almost work a miracle? well, wait for the miracle i
hope to accomplish, or----â€

â€œor, take care, morrel, lest i call you ungrateful.â€

women had entered madame de villefortâ€™s service,--in fact, everywhere,
to the concierge and coachmen, new faces were presented to the different
masters of the house, thus widening the division which had always
existed between the members of the same family.

the assizes, also, were about to begin, and villefort, shut up in his
room, exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case
against the murderer of caderousse. this affair, like all those in which
the count of monte cristo had interfered, caused a great sensation in
paris. the proofs were certainly not convincing, since they rested upon
a few words written by an escaped galley-slave on his death-bed, and who
might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion.
but the mind of the procureur was made up; he felt assured that
benedetto was guilty, and he hoped by his skill in conducting this
aggravated case to flatter his self-love, which was about the only

â€œhe is worn out,â€ said debray; â€œbesides, he could not well appear in
public, since he has been the dupe of the cavalcanti, who, it appears,
presented themselves to him with false letters of credit, and cheated
him out of 100,000 francs upon the hypothesis of this principality.â€
