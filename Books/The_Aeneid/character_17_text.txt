  alternate hopes and fears their minds possess,
  whether to deem 'em dead, or in distress.
  above the rest, aeneas mourns the fate
  of brave orontes, and th' uncertain state
  of gyas, lycus, and of amycus.
  the day, but not their sorrows, ended thus.

  when, from aloft, almighty jove surveys
  earth, air, and shores, and navigable seas,
  at length on libyan realms he fix'd his eyes-
  whom, pond'ring thus on human miseries,
  when venus saw, she with a lowly look,
  not free from tears, her heav'nly sire bespoke:

  "o king of gods and men! whose awful hand
  disperses thunder on the seas and land,
  disposing all with absolute command;
  how could my pious son thy pow'r incense?
  or what, alas! is vanish'd troy's offense?
  our hope of italy not only lost,
  on various seas by various tempests toss'd,
  but shut from ev'ry shore, and barr'd from ev'ry coast.

  her hand sustain'd a bow; her quiver hung behind.
  she seem'd a virgin of the spartan blood:
  with such array harpalyce bestrode
  her thracian courser and outstripp'd the rapid flood.
  "ho, strangers! have you lately seen," she said,
  "one of my sisters, like myself array'd,
  who cross'd the lawn, or in the forest stray'd?
  a painted quiver at her back she bore;
  varied with spots, a lynx's hide she wore;
  and at full cry pursued the tusky boar."

  thus venus: thus her son replied again:
  "none of your sisters have we heard or seen,
  o virgin! or what other name you bear
  above that style- o more than mortal fair!
  your voice and mien celestial birth betray!
  if, as you seem, the sister of the day,
  or one at least of chaste diana's train,
  let not an humble suppliant sue in vain;
  but tell a stranger, long in tempests toss'd,
  what earth we tread, and who commands the coast?

  the prince pursued the parting deity
  with words like these: "ah! whither do you fly?
  unkind and cruel! to deceive your son
  in borrow'd shapes, and his embrace to shun;
  never to bless my sight, but thus unknown;
  and still to speak in accents not your own."
  against the goddess these complaints he made,
  but took the path, and her commands obey'd.
  they march, obscure; for venus kindly shrouds
  with mists their persons, and involves in clouds,
  that, thus unseen, their passage none might stay,
  or force to tell the causes of their way.
  this part perform'd, the goddess flies sublime
  to visit paphos and her native clime;
  where garlands, ever green and ever fair,
  with vows are offer'd, and with solemn pray'r:
  a hundred altars in her temple smoke;

  "what fate, o goddess-born; what angry pow'rs
  have cast you shipwrack'd on our barren shores?
  are you the great aeneas, known to fame,
  who from celestial seed your lineage claim?

  to ruin troy and set the world on flame;
  the scepter priam's eldest daughter bore,
  her orient necklace, and the crown she wore

  one order set with gems, and one with gold.
  instructed thus, the wise achates goes,

  new counsels tries, and new designs prepares:
  that cupid should assume the shape and face
  of sweet ascanius, and the sprightly grace;
  should bring the presents, in her nephew's stead,
  and in eliza's veins the gentle poison shed:
  for much she fear'd the tyrians, double-tongued,
  and knew the town to juno's care belong'd.
  these thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke,
  and thus alarm'd, to winged love she spoke:

  and large recruits he to my navy sends:

  meantime, my sire commands to hoist our sails,
  lest we should lose the first auspicious gales.

  "the prophet bless'd the parting crew, and last,

  meantime the rising tow'rs are at a stand;
  no labors exercise the youthful band,
  nor use of arts, nor toils of arms they know;
  the mole is left unfinish'd to the foe;
  the mounds, the works, the walls, neglected lie,
  short of their promis'd heighth, that seem'd to threat the sky,

  but when imperial juno, from above,
  saw dido fetter'd in the chains of love,
  hot with the venom which her veins inflam'd,
  and by no sense of shame to be reclaim'd,
  with soothing words to venus she begun:
  "high praises, endless honors, you have won,
  and mighty trophies, with your worthy son!
  two gods a silly woman have undone!
  nor am i ignorant, you both suspect
  this rising city, which my hands erect:
  but shall celestial discord never cease?
  't is better ended in a lasting peace.

  then venus, who her hidden fraud descried,
  which would the scepter of the world misguide
  to libyan shores, thus artfully replied:
  "who, but a fool, would wars with juno choose,
  and such alliance and such gifts refuse,
  if fortune with our joint desires comply?
  the doubt is all from jove and destiny;
  lest he forbid, with absolute command,
  to mix the people in one common land-
  or will the trojan and the tyrian line
  in lasting leagues and sure succession join?

  he calls cyllenius, and the god attends,
  by whom his menacing command he sends:
  "go, mount the western winds, and cleave the sky;
  then, with a swift descent, to carthage fly:
  there find the trojan chief, who wastes his days
  in slothful riot and inglorious ease,
  nor minds the future city, giv'n by fate.
  to him this message from my mouth relate:
  'not so fair venus hop'd, when twice she won
  thy life with pray'rs, nor promis'd such a son.
  hers was a hero, destin'd to command
  a martial race, and rule the latian land,
  who should his ancient line from teucer draw,
  and on the conquer'd world impose the law.'
  if glory cannot move a mind so mean,
  nor future praise from fading pleasure wean,
  yet why should he defraud his son of fame,
  and grudge the romans their immortal name!

  then thus the mighty ruler of the main:

  she said; and straight her arms, of snowy hue,
  about her unresolving husband threw.
  her soft embraces soon infuse desire;
  his bones and marrow sudden warmth inspire;
  and all the godhead feels the wonted fire.
  not half so swift the rattling thunder flies,

  and proud araxes, whom no bridge could bind;
  the danes' unconquer'd offspring march behind,
  and morini, the last of humankind.

  these figures, on the shield divinely wrought,

  unknown the names, he yet admires the grace,

  while these affairs in distant places pass'd,
  the various iris juno sends with haste,
  to find bold turnus, who, with anxious thought,
  the secret shade of his great grandsire sought.
  retir'd alone she found the daring man,
  and op'd her rosy lips, and thus began:

  "these monsters for the trojans' fate are meant,
  and are by jove for black presages sent.
  he takes the cowards' last relief away;
  for fly they cannot, and, constrain'd to stay,
  must yield unfought, a base inglorious prey.
  the liquid half of all the globe is lost;
  heav'n shuts the seas, and we secure the coast.
  theirs is no more than that small spot of ground
  which myriads of our martial men surround.
  their fates i fear not, or vain oracles.
  't was giv'n to venus they should cross the seas,
  and land secure upon the latian plains:
  their promis'd hour is pass'd, and mine remains.
  't is in the fate of turnus to destroy,
  with sword and fire, the faithless race of troy.
  shall such affronts as these alone inflame
  the grecian brothers, and the grecian name?
  my cause and theirs is one; a fatal strife,
  and final ruin, for a ravish'd wife.

  a lawful time of war at length will come,
  (nor need your haste anticipate the doom),
  when carthage shall contend the world with rome,
  shall force the rigid rocks and alpine chains,
  and, like a flood, come pouring on the plains.
  then is your time for faction and debate,
  for partial favor, and permitted hate.
  let now your immature dissension cease;
  sit quiet, and compose your souls to peace."

  thus jupiter in few unfolds the charge;
  but lovely venus thus replies at large:
  "o pow'r immense, eternal energy,
  (for to what else protection can we fly?)
  seest thou the proud rutulians, how they dare
  in fields, unpunish'd, and insult my care?
  how lofty turnus vaunts amidst his train,
  in shining arms, triumphant on the plain?
  ev'n in their lines and trenches they contend,
  and scarce their walls the trojan troops defend:

  from acmon's hands a rolling stone there came,
  so large, it half deserv'd a mountain's name:

  his brother mnestheus could not more have done,
  or the great father of th' intrepid son.
  some firebrands throw, some flights of arrows send;
  and some with darts, and some with stones defend.

  amid the press appears the beauteous boy,
  the care of venus, and the hope of troy.
  his lovely face unarm'd, his head was bare;
  in ringlets o'er his shoulders hung his hair.
  his forehead circled with a diadem;
  distinguish'd from the crowd, he shines a gem,
  enchas'd in gold, or polish'd iv'ry set,
  amidst the meaner foil of sable jet.

  now lucagus and liger scour the plains,
  with two white steeds; but liger holds the reins,
  and lucagus the lofty seat maintains:
  bold brethren both. the former wav'd in air
  his flaming sword: aeneas couch'd his spear,
  unus'd to threats, and more unus'd to fear.
  then liger thus: "thy confidence is vain
  to scape from hence, as from the trojan plain:
  nor these the steeds which diomede bestrode,
  nor this the chariot where achilles rode;
  nor venus' veil is here, near neptune's shield;
  thy fatal hour is come, and this the field."
  thus liger vainly vaunts: the trojan peer
  return'd his answer with his flying spear.
  as lucagus, to lash his horses, bends,
  prone to the wheels, and his left foot protends,
  prepar'd for fight; the fatal dart arrives,
  and thro' the borders of his buckler drives;
  pass'd thro' and pierc'd his groin: the deadly wound,
  cast from his chariot, roll'd him on the ground.
  whom thus the chief upbraids wi

  then thro' his breast his fatal sword he sent,
  and the soul issued at the gaping vent.

  as storms the skies, and torrents tear the ground,
  thus rag'd the prince, and scatter'd deaths around.
  at length ascanius and the trojan train
  broke from the camp, so long besieg'd in vain.

  meantime the king of gods and mortal man
  held conference with his queen, and thus began:
  "my sister goddess, and well-pleasing wife,
  still think you venus' aid supports the strife-
  sustains her trojans- or themselves, alone,
  with inborn valor force their fortune on?
  how fierce in fight, with courage undecay'd!
  judge if such warriors want immortal aid."
  to whom the goddess with the charming eyes,
  soft in her tone, submissively replies:
  "why, o my sov'reign lord, whose frown i fear,
  and cannot, unconcern'd, your anger bear;
  why urge you thus my grief? when, if i still

  but the same fate the victor underwent,
  slain by nealces' hand, well-skill'd to throw

  thus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance;
  by turns they quit their ground, by turns advance:
  victors and vanquish'd, in the various field,
  nor wholly overcome, nor wholly yield.
  the gods from heav'n survey the fatal strife,
  and mourn the miseries of human life.
  above the rest, two goddesses appear
  concern'd for each: here venus, juno there.
  amidst the crowd, infernal ate shakes
  her scourge aloft, and crest of hissing snakes.

  once more the proud mezentius, with disdain,
  brandish'd his spear, and rush'd into the plain,
  where tow'ring in the midmost rank she stood,
  like tall orion stalking o'er the flood.
  (when with his brawny breast he cuts the waves,
  his shoulders scarce the topmost billow laves),
  or like a mountain ash, whose roots are spread,
  deep fix'd in earth; in clouds he hides his head.

 undistinguish'd noise ascends the sky,
  the shouts of those who kill, and groans of those who die.

  but now the goddess mother, mov'd with grief,
  and pierc'd with pity, hastens her relief.
  a branch of healing dittany she brought,
  which in the cretan fields with care she sought:
  rough is the stern, which woolly leafs surround;
  the leafs with flow'rs, the flow'rs with purple crown'd,
  well known to wounded goats; a sure relief
  to draw the pointed steel, and ease the grief.
  this venus brings, in clouds involv'd, and brews
  th' extracted liquor with ambrosian dews,
  and odorous panacee. unseen she stands,
  temp'ring the mixture with her heav'nly hands,
  and pours it in a bowl, already crown'd
  with juice of med'c'nal herbs prepar'd to bathe the wound.
  the leech, unknowing of superior art
  which aids the cure, with this foments the part;
  and in a moment ceas'd the raging smart.
  stanch'd is the blood, and in the bottom stands:
  the steel, but scarcely touch'd with
