represent a _later_ elaboration of the tendency to connect religious
teachings with the exploits of a favorite hero.

we now have further evidence both of the extreme antiquity of the
literary form of the gilgamesh epic and also of the disposition to
make the epic the medium of illustrating aspects of life and the
destiny of mankind. the discovery by dr. arno poebel of a sumerian
form of the tale of the descent of ishtar to the lower world and her
release [11]--apparently a nature myth to illustrate the change of
season from summer to winter and back again to spring--enables us to
pass beyond the akkadian (or semitic) form of tales current in the
euphrates valley to the sumerian form. furthermore, we are indebted
to dr. langdon for the identification of two sumerian fragments in the
nippur collection which deal with the adventures of gilgamesh, one in
constantinople, [12] the other in the collection of t

of gilgamesh with which he arms himself
for an encounter--presumably the encounter with humbaba or huwawa,
the ruler of the cedar forest in the mountain. [14] the latter deals
with the building operations of gilgamesh in the city of erech. a
text in zimmern's _sumerische kultlieder aus altbabylonischer zeit_
(leipzig, 1913), no. 196, appears likewise to be a fragment of the
sumerian version of the gilgamesh epic, bearing on the episode of
gilgamesh's and enkidu's relations to the goddess ishtar, covered in
the sixth and seventh tablets of the assyrian version. [15]

until, however, further fragments shall have turned up, it would
be hazardous to institute a comparison between the sumerian and the
akkadian versions. all that can be said for the present is that there
is every reason to believe in the existence of a literary form of the
epic in sumerian which presumably antedated the akkadian recension,
just as we have a sumerian form of ishtar's descent into the nether
world, a

r indication that enkidu is the real conqueror of
huwawa, we find the coming contest revealed to enkidu no less than
three times in dreams, which gilgamesh interprets. [91] since the
person who dreams is always the one to whom the dream applies, we may
see in these dreams a further trace of the primary rôle originally
assigned to enkidu.

another exploit which, according to the assyrian version, the two
heroes perform in concert is the killing of a bull, sent by anu at
the instance of ishtar to avenge an insult offered to the goddess
by gilgamesh, who rejects her offer of marriage. in the fragmentary
description of the contest with the bull, we find enkidu "seizing"
the monster by "its tail." [92]

that enkidu originally played the part of the slayer is also shown
by the statement that it is he who insults ishtar by throwing a
piece of the carcass into the goddess' face, [93] adding also an
insulting speech; and this despite the fact that ishtar in her rage
accuses gilgame

sh of killing the bull. [94] it is thus evident that
the epic alters the original character of the episodes in order to
find a place for gilgamesh, with the further desire to assign to the
latter the _chief_ rôle. be it noted also that enkidu, not gilgamesh,
is punished for the insult to ishtar. enkidu must therefore in the
original form of the episode have been the guilty party, who is
stricken with mortal disease as a punishment to which after twelve
days he succumbs. [95] in view of this, we may supply the name of
enkidu in the little song introduced at the close of the encounter
with the bull, and not gilgamesh as has hitherto been done.


	"who is distinguished among the heroes?
	who is glorious among men?
	[enkidu] is distinguished among heroes,
	[enkidu] is glorious

among men." [96]


finally, the killing of lions is directly ascribed to enkidu in the
pennsylvania tablet:


	"lions he attacked
	*     *     *     *     *
	lions he overcame" [97]


whereas gilgamesh appears to be afraid of lions. on his long search
for utnapishtim he says:


	"on reaching the entrance of the mountain at night
	i saw lions and was afraid." [98]


he prays to sin and ishtar to protect and save him. when, therefore,
in another passage some one celebrates gilgamesh as the one who
overcame the "guardian," who dispatched hu(m)baba in the cedar forest,
who killed lions and overthrew the bull, [99] we have the completion
of the process which transferred to gilgamesh exploits and powers
which originally belonged to enkidu, though ordinarily the process
stops short at making gilgamesh a _sharer_ in the exploits; with the
natural tendency, to be sure, to enlarge the

y that the
people are impelled to implore aruru to create a rival who may rid
the district of the cruel tyrant, who is described as snatching sons
and daughters from their families, and in other ways terrifying the
population--an early example of "schrecklichkeit." tablets ii to
v inclusive of the assyrian version being taken up with the huwawa
episode, modified with a view of bringing the two heroes together,
we come at once to the sixth tablet, which tells the story of how
the goddess ishtar wooed gilgamesh, and of the latter's rejection
of her advances. this tale is distinctly a nature myth. the attempt
of gressmann [116] to find some historical background to the episode
is a failure. the goddess ishtar symbolizes the earth which woos the
sun in the spring, but whose love is fatal, for after a few months
the sun's power begins to wane. gilgamesh, who in incantation hymns
is invoked in terms which show that he was conceived as a sun-god,
[117] recalls to the goddess how she

for revenge. at this point the episode of the creation of the bull is
introduced, but if the analysis above given is correct it is enkidu
who is the hero in dispatching the bull, and we must assume that the
sickness with which gilgamesh is smitten is the punishment sent by anu
to avenge the insult to his daughter. this sickness symbolizes the
waning strength of the sun after midsummer is past. the sun recedes
from the earth, and this was pictured in the myth as the sun-god's
rejection of ishtar; gilgamesh's fear of death marks the approach
of the winter season, when the sun appears to have lost its vigor
completely and is near to death. the entire episode is, therefore,
a nature myth, symbolical of the passing of spring to midsummer and
then to the bare season. the myth has been attached to gilgamesh as
a favorite figure, and then woven into a pattern with the episode
of enkidu and the bull. the bull episode can be detached from the
nature myth without any loss to the symbolism

 of the tale of ishtar
and gilgamesh.

as already suggested, with enkidu's death after this conquest
of the bull the original enkidu epic came to an end. in order to
connect gilgamesh with enkidu, the former is represented as sharing
in the struggle against the bull. enkidu is punished with death,
while gilgamesh is smitten with disease. since both shared equally
in the guilt, the punishment should have been the same for both. the
differentiation may be taken as an indication that gilgamesh's disease
has no

 tale is obvious. only those
singled out by the special favor of the gods can hope to be removed
to the distant "source of the streams" and live forever. the rest of
mankind must face death as the end of life.

that the story of the deluge is told in the eleventh tablet of the
series, corresponding to the eleventh month, known as the month of
"rain curse" [120] and marking the height of the rainy season, may
be intentional, just as it may not be accidental that gilgamesh's
rejection of ishtar is recounted in the sixth tablet, corresponding to
the sixth month, [121] which marks the end of the summer season. the
two tales may have formed part of a cycle of myths, distributed
among the months of the year. the gilgamesh epic, however, does
not form such a cycle. both myths have been artificially attached
to the adventures of the hero. for the deluge story we now have the
definite proof for its independent existence, through dr. poebel's
publication of a sumerian text which embodi

derings,
(5) the deluge, (6) the search for immortality, were all included
at the time that the old babylonian version was compiled cannot, of
course, be determined until we have that version in a more complete
form. since the two tablets thus far recovered show that as early as
2000 b.c. the enkidu tale had already been amalgamated with the current
stories about gilgamesh, and the endeavor made to transfer the traits
of the former to the latter, it is eminently likely that the story of
ishtar's unhappy love adventure with gilgamesh was included, as well
as gilgamesh's punishment and the death of enkidu. with the evidence
furnished by meissner's fragment of a version of the old babylonian
revision and by our two tablets, of the early disposition to make
popular tales the medium of illustrating current beliefs and the
teachings of the temple schools, it may furthermore be concluded that
the death of enkidu and the punishment of gilgamesh were utilized for
didactic purposes in t

f too general a character to be of
much moment; and moreover the parallels stop short at the critical
point, for gilgamesh though worsted is _not_ killed by enkidu,
whereas one of the "heavenly twins" is always killed by the brother,
as abel is by cain, and iphikles by his twin brother herakles. even
the trait which is frequent in the earliest forms of the "heavenly
twins," according to which one is immortal and the other is mortal,
though applying in a measure to enkidu who is killed by ishtar, while
gilgamesh the offspring of a divine pair is only smitten with disease,
is too unsubstantial to warrant more than a general comparison between
the enkidu-gilgamesh pair and the various forms of the "twin" _motif_
found throughout the ancient world. for all that, the point is of some
interest that in the gilgamesh epic we should encounter two figures who
are portrayed as possessing the same traits and accomplishing feats in
common, which suggest a partial parallel to the various for

of column 4 is missing, though it may, of course, have been included
in part in the recital in the first tablet of the old babylonian
version. lines 49-59 of the pennsylvania tablet are covered by 33-39,
the only slight difference being the specific mention in line 58 of
the pennsylvania tablet of eanna, the temple in erech, described as
"the dwelling of anu," whereas in the assyrian version eanna is merely
referred to as the "holy house" and described as "the dwelling of
anu and ishtar," where ishtar is clearly a later addition.

leaving aside lines 60-61, which may be merely a variant (though
independent) of line 39 of column 4 of the assyrian version, we now
have in the pennsylvania tablet a second speech of the woman to enkidu
(not represented in the assyrian version) beginning like the first
one with _alka_, "come" (lines 62-63), in which she asks enkidu to
leave the "accursed ground" in which he dwells. this speech, as the
description which follows, extending int

puts his foot in the gate leading to the house where the goddess is,
and thus prevents gish from entering. thereupon the two have a fierce
encounter in which gish is worsted. the meaning of the episode itself
is not clear. does enkidu propose to deprive gish, here viewed as a god
(cf. line 190 of the pennsylvania tablet = assyrian version, tablet
i, 4, 45, "like a god"), of his spouse, the goddess ishhara--another
form of ishtar? or are the two heroes, the one a counterpart of the
other, contesting for the possession of a goddess? is it in this
scene that enkidu becomes the "rival" (_me-ih-rù_, line 191 of the
pennsylvania tablet) of the divine gish? we must content ourself with
having obtained through the pennsylvania tablet a clearer indication
of the occasion of the fight between the two heroes, and leave the
further explanation of the episode till a fortunate chance may throw
additional light upon it. there
