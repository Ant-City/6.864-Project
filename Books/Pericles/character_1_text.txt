 been sung at festivals,
on ember-eves and holy-ales;
and lords and ladies in their lives
have read it for restoratives:
the purchase is to make men glorious;
et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius.
if you, born in these latter times,
when wit's more ripe, accept my rhymes,
and that to hear an old man sing
may to your wishes pleasure bring,
i life would wish, and that i might
waste it for you, like taper-light.
this antioch, then, antiochus the great
built up, this city, for his chiefest seat;
the fairest in all syria,
i tell you what mine authors say:
this king unto him took a fere,
who died and left a female heir,
so buxom, so blithe, and full of face,
as heaven had lent her all his grace;
with whom the father liking took,
and her to incest did provoke:
bad child; worse father! to entice his own
to evil should be done by none:
but custom what they did begin
was with long use account no sin.
the beauty of this sinfu

to seek her as a bed-fellow,
in marriage-pleasures play-fellow:
which to prevent he made a law,
to keep her still, and men in awe,
that whoso ask'd her for his wife,
his riddle told not, lost his life:
so for her many a wight did die,
as yon grim looks do testify.
what now ensues, to the judgement your eye
i give, my cause who lest can justify.

my frail mortality to know itself,
and by those fearful objects to prepare

who tells us life 's but breath, to trust it error.
i'll make my will then, and, as sick men do
who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,
gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;

e quiet?
here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,
and danger, which i fear'd, is at antioch,
whose arm seems far too short to hit me here:
yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,
nor yet the other's distance comfort me.
then it is thus: the passions of the mind,
that have their first conception by mis-dread
have after-nourishment and life by care;
and what was first but fear what might he done,
grows elder now and cares it be not done.
and so with me: the great antiochus,
'gainst whom i am too little to contend,
since he 's so great can make his will his act,
will think me speaking, though i swear to silence;
nor boots it me to say i honour him.
if he suspect i may dishonour him:
and what may make him blush in being known,
he'll stop the course by which it might be known;
with hostile forces he'11 o'erspread the land,
and with the ostent of war will look so huge,
amazement shall drive courage from the state;
our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,

musings into my mind, with thousand doubts
how i might stop this tempest ere it came;
and finding little comfort to relieve them,
i thought it princely charity to grieve them.

helicanus.
well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak,
freely will i speak. antiochus you fear,
and justly too, i think, you fear the tyrant,
who either by public war or private treason
will take away your life.
therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,
till that his rage and anger be forgot,
or till the destinies do cut his thread of life.

what from antioch?

helicanus.
royal antiochus -- on what cause i know not
took some displeasure at him; at least he judged so:
and doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd,
to show his sorrow, he 'ld correct himself;
so puts himself unto the shipman's toil,
with whom each minute threatens life or death.

thaliard. [aside.]
well, i perceive
i shall not be hang'd now, although i would;
but since he 's gone, the king's seas must please
he  'scaped the land, to perish at the sea.
i 'll present myself.  peace to the lords of tyre!

no, escanes, know this of me,
antiochus from incest lived not free:
for which, the most high gods not minding longer
to withhold the vengeance that they had in store
due to this heinous capital offence,
even in the height and pride of all his glory,
when he was seated in a chariot
of an inestimable value, and his daughter with him,
a fire from heavn came and shrivell'd up
their bodies, even to loathing; for they so stunk,
that all those eyes adored them ere their fall
scorn now their hand should give them burial.

by many a dern and painful perch
of pericles the careful search,
by the four opposing coigns
which the world together joins,
is made with all due diligence

fame answering the most strange inquire,
to the court of king simonides

antiochus and his daughter dead;

gower.
in antiochus and his daughter you have heard
of monstrous lust the due and just reward:
in pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,
although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,
virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last:
in helicanus may you well descry
a figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:
in reverend cerimon there well appears
the worth that learned charity aye wears:
for wicked cleon and his wife, when fame
had spread their cursed deed,
