oints curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth--a
fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the
whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a
spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had
fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion
of the day, like sleigh-runners--an effect patiently and laboriously
produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a
wall for hours together. mr. walters was very earnest of mien, and very
sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places
in such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that
unconsciously to himself his sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar
intonation which was wholly absent on week-days. he began after this
fashion:

ï¿½now, children, i want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as
you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. there--that
is it. that is the way good litt

nd be good.ï¿½ and so forth and so
on. it is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. it was of a
pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.

the latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights
and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings
and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of
isolated and incorruptible rocks like sid and mary. but now every sound
ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of mr. waltersï¿½ voice, and the
conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.

a good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was
more or less rare--the entrance of visitors: lawyer thatcher, accompanied
by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman
with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latterï¿½s
wife. the lady was leading a child. tom had been restless and full of
chafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too-

reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the
ranks of staring eyes. this was the great judge thatcher, brother of
their own lawyer. jeff thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar
with the great man and be envied by the school. it would have been music
to his soul to hear the whisperings:

ï¿½look at him, jim! heï¿½s a going up there. say--look! heï¿½s a going to
shake hands with him--he _is_ shaking hands with him! by jings, donï¿½t you
wish you was jeff?ï¿½

mr. walters fell to ï¿½showing off,ï¿½ with all sorts of official bustlings
and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging
directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a target. the
librarian ï¿½showed offï¿½--running hither and thither with his arms full of
books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority
delights in. the young lady teachers ï¿½showed offï¿½--bending sweetly over
pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers
at bad lit

business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times
(with much seeming vexation). the little girls ï¿½showed offï¿½ in various
ways, and the little boys ï¿½showed offï¿½ with such diligence that the air
was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. and above it
all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all
the house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur--for he was
ï¿½showing off,ï¿½ too.

there was only one thing wanting to make mr. waltersï¿½ ecstasy complete,
and that was a chance to deliver a bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy.
several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough--he had been
around among the star pupils inquiring. he would have given worlds, now,
to have that german lad back again with a sound mind.

and now at this moment, when hope was dead, tom sawyer came forward with
nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded
a bible. this was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. walters wa

have liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark. the
judge put his hand on tomï¿½s head and called him a fine little man, and
asked him what his name was. the boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:

ï¿½tom.ï¿½

ï¿½oh, no, not tom--it is--ï¿½

ï¿½thomas.ï¿½

ï¿½ah, thatï¿½s it. i thought there was more to it, maybe. thatï¿½s very well.
but youï¿½ve another one i daresay, and youï¿½ll tell it to me, wonï¿½t you?ï¿½

ï¿½tell the gentleman your other name, thomas,ï¿½ said walters, ï¿½and say
sir. you mustnï¿½t forget your manners.ï¿½

ï¿½thomas sawyer--sir.ï¿½

ï¿½thatï¿½s it! thatï¿½s a good boy. fine boy. fine, manly little fellow. two
thousand verses is a great many--very, very great many. and you never can
be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is worth
more than anything there is in the world; itï¿½s what makes great men
and good men; youï¿½ll be a great man and a good man yourself, some
day, thomas, and then youï¿½ll look back and say, itï¿

say, thomas--and you wouldnï¿½t take any money for those two thousand
verses--no indeed you wouldnï¿½t. and now you wouldnï¿½t mind telling me and
this lady some of the things youï¿½ve learned--no, i know you wouldnï¿½t--for
we are proud of little boys that learn. now, no doubt you know the names
of all the twelve disciples. wonï¿½t you tell us the names of the first
two that were appointed?ï¿½

tom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. he blushed,
now, and his eyes fell. mr. waltersï¿½ heart sank within him. he said
to himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest
question--why _did_ the judge ask him? yet he felt obliged to speak up
and say:

ï¿½answer the gentleman, thomas--donï¿½t be afraid.ï¿½

tom still hung fire.

ï¿½now i know youï¿½ll tell me,ï¿½ said the lady. ï¿½the names of the first two
disciples were--ï¿½

ï¿½_david and goliah!_ï¿½

let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.
