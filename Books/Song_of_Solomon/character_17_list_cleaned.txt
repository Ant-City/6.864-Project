[CHARACTER] - 
                	milkman's
great-grandfather, who supposedly flew back to africa but dropped
his son jake shortly after taking off. [CHARACTER]'s flight is a physical
demonstration of the liberation that is felt when a person escapes confining
circumstances. however, [CHARACTER]'s crying wife, ryna, and traumatized
children show that escape has negative consequences as well.
