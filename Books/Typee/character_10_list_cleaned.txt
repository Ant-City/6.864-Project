[CHARACTER] - 
      a fierce one-eyed chieftain who appears several times, mostly at the very end of the book. [CHARACTER] is a threatening figure who primarily serves to contrast with the gentler nobility of chief mehevi. the expression of [CHARACTER]'s ferocity is the final image we receive of the typees. it is not consistent with the peaceful image that has been developed throughout the book.
