from him i come
with message unto princely pericles;
but since my landing i have understood
your lord has betook himself to unknown travels,
my message must return from whence it came.

we have no reason to desire it,
commended to our master, not to us:
yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire,
as friends to antioch, we may feast in tyre.

that were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;
for who digs hills because they do aspire
throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.
o my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;
here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,
but like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.

o dionyza,
who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,
or can conceal his hunger till he famish?
our tongues and sorrows do sound deep
our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,
till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;
that, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,
they may awake their helps to comfort them.
i'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,
and wanting breath to speak help me with tears.

dionyza.
i'll do my best, sir.

cleon.
this tarsus, o'er which i have the government,
a city on whom plenty held full hand,
for riches strew'd herself even in the streets;
whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,
and strangers ne'er beheld but wonder'd at;
whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,
like one another's glass to trim them by:
their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,
and not so much to feed on as delight;
all poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,
the name of help grew odious to rep

eat.

dionyza.
o, 'tis too true.

cleon.
but see what heaven can do!  by this our change,
these mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,
were all too little to content and please,
although they gave their creatures in abundance,
as houses are defiled for want of use,
they are now starved for want of exercise:
those palates who, not yet two summers younger,
must have inventions to delight the taste,
would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:
those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,
thought nought too curious, are

ready now
to eat those little darlings whom they loved.
so sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife
draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:
here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;
here many sink, yet those which see them fall
have scarce strength left to give them burial.
is not this true?

dionyza.
our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.

cleon.
o, let those cities that of plenty's cup
and her prosperities so largely taste,
with their superflous riots, hear these tears!
the misery of tarsus may be theirs.

[enter a lord.]

lord.
where's the lord governor?

cleon.
here.
speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,
for comfort is too far for us to expect.

lord.
we have descried, upon our neighbouring shore,
a portly sail of ships make hitherward.

cleon.
i thought as much.
one sorrow never comes but brings

an heir,
that may succeed as his inheritor;
and so in ours: some neighbouring nation,
taking advantage of our misery,
math stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,
to beat us down, the which are down already;
and make a conquest of unhappy me,
whereas no glory's got to overcome.

lord.
that's the least fear; for, by the semblance
of their white flags display'd, they bring us peace,
and come to us as favourers, not as foes.

cleon.
thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat:
who makes the fairest show means most deceit.
but bring they what they will and what they can,
what need we fear?
the ground's the lowest, and we are half way there.
go tell their general we attend him here,
to know for what he comes, and whence he comes,
and what he craves.

lord.
i go, my lord.

welcome is peace, if he on peace consist;
if wars, we are unable to resist.

pericles.

or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,
be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,

your grace is welcome to our town and us.

which welcome we'll accept; feast here awhile,
until our stars that frown lend us a smile.

now to marina bend your mind,
whom our fast-growing scene must find
at tarsus, and by cleon train'd
in music, letters; who hath gain'd
of education all the grace,
which makes her both the heart and place
of general wonder. but, alack,
that monster envy, oft the wrack
of earned praise, marina's life
seeks to take off by treason's knife.
and in this kind hath our cleon
one daughter, and a wench full grown,
even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid
hight philoten: and it is said
for certain in our story, she
would ever with marina be:

by hurting it; or when to the lute

she would with rich and constant pen
vail to her mistress dian; still
this philoten contends in skill
with absolute marina: so
with the dove of paphos might the crow
vie feathers white.  marina gets
all praises, which are paid as debts,
and not as given. this so darks
in philoten all graceful marks,
that cleon's wife, with envy rare,
a present murderer does prepare
for good marina, that her daughter
might stand peerless by this slaughter.
the sooner her vile thoughts to stead,
lychorida, our nurse, is dead:
and cursed dionyza hath
the pregnant instrument of wrath

in antiochus and his daughter you have heard
of monstrous lust the due and just reward:
in pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,
although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,
virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last:
in helicanus may you well descry
a figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:
in reverend cerimon there well appears
the worth that learned charity aye wears:
for wicked cleon and his wife, when fame
had spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name
of pericles, to rage the city turn,
that him and his they in his palace burn;
the gods for murder seemed so content
to punish them although not done but meant.
so, on your patence evermore attending,
new joy wait on you! here our play has ending.
