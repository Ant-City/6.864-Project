pleworth and paul looking down on them from the far end of
the room. they stopped singing.

â€œcanâ€™t you make a bit less row?â€ said mr. pappleworth. â€œfolkâ€™ll think we
keep cats.â€

a hunchback woman on a high stool turned her long, rather heavy face
towards mr. pappleworth, and said, in a contralto voice:

â€œtheyâ€™re all tom-cats then.â€

in vain mr. pappleworth tried to be impressive for paulâ€™s benefit.
he descended the steps into the finishing-off room, and went to the
hunchback fanny. she had such a short body on her high stool that her
head, with its great bands of bright brown hair, seemed over large, as
did her pale, heavy face. she wore a dress of green-black cashmere, and
her wrists, coming out of the narrow cuffs, were thin and flat, as she
put down her work nervously. he showed her something that was wrong with
a knee-cap.

â€œwell,â€ she said, â€œyou neednâ€™t come blaming it on to me. itâ€™s not my
fault.â€ her colour mounted to her cheek.

â€œi never said it was

 your fault. will you do as i tell you?â€ replied mr.
pappleworth shortly.

â€œyou donâ€™t say itâ€™s my fault, but youâ€™d like to make out as it was,â€ the
hunchback woman cried, almost in tears. then she snatched the knee-cap
from her â€œbossâ€, saying: â€œyes, iâ€™ll do it for you, but you neednâ€™t be
snappy.â€

â€œhereâ€™s your new lad,â€ said mr. pappleworth.

fanny turned, smiling very gently on paul.

â€œoh!â€ she said.

â€œyes; donâ€™t make a softy of him between you.â€

â€œitâ€™s not us as â€˜ud make a softy of him,â€ she said indignantly.

â€œcome on then, paul,â€ said mr. pappleworth.

â€œau revoy, paul,â€ said one of the girls.

there was a titter of laughter. paul went out, blushing deeply, not
having spoken a word.

the day was very long. all morning the work-people were coming to speak
to mr. pappleworth. paul was writing or learning to make

e boy, what a nuisance he is! why, this is how you do it.â€

he watched her attentively. suddenly a whistle piped. then polly
appeared, and said in a clear voice:

â€œmr. pappleworth wants to know how much longer youâ€™re going to be down
here playing with the girls, paul.â€

paul flew upstairs, calling â€œgood-bye!â€ and emma drew herself up.

â€œit wasnâ€™t me who wanted him to play with the machine,â€ she said.

as a rule, when all the girls came back at two oâ€™clock, he ran upstairs
to fanny, the hunchback, in the finishing-off room. mr. pappleworth
did not appear till twenty to three, and he often found his boy sitting
beside fanny, talking, or drawing, or singing with the girls.

often, after a minuteâ€™s hesitation, fanny would begin to sing. she had a
fine contralto voice. everybody joined in the chorus, and it went well.
paul was not at all embarrassed, after a while, sitting in the room with
the half a dozen work-girls.

at the end of the song fanny would say:

â€œi know youâ

€™ve been laughing at me.â€

â€œdonâ€™t be so soft, fanny!â€ cried one of the girls.

once there was mention of connieâ€™s red hair.

â€œfannyâ€™s is better, to my fancy,â€ said emma.

â€œyou neednâ€™t try to make a fool of me,â€ said fanny, flushing deeply.

â€œno, but she has, paul; sheâ€™s got beautiful hair.â€

â€œitâ€™s a treat of a colour,â€ said he. â€œthat coldish colour like earth,
and yet shiny. itâ€™s like bog-water.â€

â€œgoodness me!â€ exclaimed one girl, laughing.

â€œhow i do but get criticised,â€ said fanny.

â€œbut you should see it down, paul,â€ cried emma earnestly. â€œitâ€™s simply
beautiful. put it down for him, fanny, if he wants something to paint.â€

fanny would not, and yet she wanted to.

â€œthen i

â€™ll take it down myself,â€ said the lad.

â€œwell, you can if you like,â€ said fanny.

and he carefully took the pins out of the knot, and the rush of hair, of
uniform dark brown, slid over the humped back.

â€œwhat a lovely lot!â€ he exclaimed.

the girls watched. there was silence. the youth shook the hair loose
from the coil.

â€œitâ€™s splendid!â€ he said, smelling its perfume. â€œiâ€™ll bet itâ€™s worth
pounds.â€

â€œiâ€™ll leave it you when i die, paul,â€ said fanny, half joking.

â€œyou look just like anybody else, sitting drying their hair,â€ said one
of the girls to the long-legged hunchback.

poor fanny was morbidly sensitive, always imagining insults. polly was
curt and businesslike. the two departments were for ever at war, and
paul was always finding fanny in tears. then he was made the recipient
of all her woes, and he had to plead her case with polly.

so the time went along happily enough. the factory had a homely feel.
no one was rushed or driv

ce leaped in little jumps
and bounds on to the card. he waited for her. without raising her head,
she said at last, in a peculiar low voice:

â€œhave you said anything about it?â€

â€œexcept to you, not a word.â€

there was again a long silence.

â€œi will apply when the advertisement is out,â€ she said.

â€œyou will apply before that. i will let you know exactly when.â€

she went on spinning her little machine, and did not contradict him.

clara came to jordanâ€™s. some of the older hands, fanny among them,
remembered her earlier rule, and cordially disliked the memory. clara
had always been â€œikeyâ€, reserved, and superior. she had never mixed with
the girls as one of themselves. if she had occasion to find fault, she
did it coolly and with perfect politeness, which the defaulter felt to
be a bigger insult than crassness. towards fanny, the poor, overstrung
hunchback, clara was unfailingly compassionate and gentle, as a result
of which fanny shed more bitter tears than ever the roug

old man, and lame from his accidents, was given
a paltry, poor job. miriam was an eternal reproach. he felt he owed
himself to her, yet could not give himself. the house, moreover, needed
his support. he was pulled in all directions. he was not glad it was his
birthday. it made him bitter.

he got to work at eight oâ€™clock. most of the clerks had not turned up.
the girls were not due till 8.30. as he was changing his coat, he heard
a voice behind him say:

â€œpaul, paul, i want you.â€

it was fanny, the hunchback, standing at the top of her stairs, her face
radiant with a secret. paul looked at her in astonishment.

â€œi want you,â€ she said.

he stood, at a loss.

â€œcome on,â€ she coaxed. â€œcome before you begin on the letters.â€

he went down the half-dozen steps into her dry, narrow, â€œfinishing-offâ€
 room. fanny walked before him: her black bodice was short--the waist was
under her armpits--and her green-black cashmere skirt seemed very
long, as she strode with big strides bef

 white apron, which was
spread on the bench in front of her. she hesitated.

â€œyou didnâ€™t think weâ€™d forgot you?â€ she asked, reproachful.

â€œwhy?â€ he asked. he had forgotten his birthday himself.

â€œâ€˜why,â€™ he says! â€˜why!â€™ why, look here!â€ she pointed to the calendar,
and he saw, surrounding the big black number â€œ21â€, hundreds of little
crosses in black-lead.

â€œoh, kisses for my birthday,â€ he laughed. â€œhow did you know?â€

â€œyes, you want to know, donâ€™t you?â€ fanny mocked, hugely delighted.
â€œthereâ€™s one from everybody--except lady clara--and two from some. but i
shanâ€™t tell you how many i put.â€

â€œoh, i know, youâ€™re spooney,â€ he said.

â€œthere you are mistaken!â€ she cried, indignant. â€œi could never be so
soft.â€ her voice was strong and contralto.

â€œyou always pretend to be such a hard-hearted hussy,â€ he laughed. â€œand
you know youâ€™re as sentimental--â€

â€œiâ€™d rather be called sentimental than frozen meat,â€ fanny blurted. p

â€œof course you are. if it comes to goodness, youâ€™re better.â€

she was rather afraid of the situation. she might get hysterical.

â€œi thought iâ€™d get here before the others--wonâ€™t they say iâ€™m deep! now
shut your eyes--â€ she said.

â€œand open your mouth, and see what god sends you,â€ he continued, suiting
action to words, and expecting a piece of chocolate. he heard the rustle
of the apron, and a faint clink of metal. â€œiâ€™m going to look,â€ he said.

he opened his eyes. fanny, her long cheeks flushed, her blue eyes
shining, was gazing at him. there was a little bundle of paint-tubes on
the bench before him. he turned pale.

â€œno, fanny,â€ he said quickly.

â€œfrom us all,â€ she answered hastily.

â€œno, but--â€

â€œare they the right sort?â€ she asked, rocking herself with delight.

â€œjove! theyâ€™re the best in the catalogue.â€

â€œbut theyâ€™re the right sorts?â€ she cried.

â€œtheyâ€™re off the little list iâ€™d made to get when my ship came in.â€ he

 his lip.

fanny was overcome with emotion. she must turn the conversation.

â€œthey was all on thorns to do it; they all paid their shares, all except
the queen of sheba.â€

the queen of sheba was clara.

â€œand wouldnâ€™t she join?â€ paul asked.

â€œshe didnâ€™t get the chance; we never told her; we wasnâ€™t going to have
her bossing this show. we didnâ€™t want her to join.â€

paul laughed at the woman. he was much moved. at last he must go. she
was very close to him. suddenly she flung her arms round his

of struggle and pain. the factory, the girls, his mother, the
large, uplifted church, the thicket of the town, merged into one
atmosphere--dark, brooding, and sorrowful, every bit.

â€œis that two oâ€™clock striking?â€ mrs. dawes said in surprise.

paul started, and everything sprang into form, regained its
individuality, its forgetfulness, and its cheerfulness.

they hurried back to work.

when he was in the rush of preparing for the nightâ€™s post, examining the
work up from fannyâ€™s room, which smelt of ironing, the evening postman
came in.

â€œâ€˜mr. paul morel,â€™â€ he said, smiling, handing paul a package. â€œa ladyâ€™s
handwriting! donâ€™t let the girls see it.â€

the postman, himself a favourite, was pleased to make fun of the girlsâ€™
affection for paul.

it was a volume of verse with a brief note: â€œyou will allow me to send
you this, and so spare me my isolation. i also sympathise and wish you
well.--c.d.â€ paul flushed hot.

â€œgood lord! mrs. dawes. she c

e morning as he ran
upstairs from the spiral room he almost collided with the burly
metal-worker.

â€œwhat the--!â€ cried the smith.

â€œsorry!â€ said paul, and passed on.

â€œsorry!â€ sneered dawes.

paul whistled lightly, â€œput me among the girlsâ€.

â€œiâ€™ll stop your whistle, my jockey!â€ he said.

the other took no notice.

â€œyouâ€™re goinâ€™ to answer for that job of the other night.â€

paul went to his desk in his corner, and turned over the leaves of the
ledger.

â€œgo and tell fanny i want order 097, quick!â€ he said to his boy.

dawes stood in the doorway, tall and threatening, looking at the top of
the young manâ€™s head.

â€œsix and fiveâ€™s eleven and sevenâ€™s one-and-six,â€ paul added aloud.

â€œanâ€™ you hear, do you!â€ said dawes.

â€œfive and ninepence!â€ he wrote a figure. â€œwhatâ€™s that?â€ he said.

â€œiâ€™m going to show you what it is,â€ said the smith.

the other went on adding the figures aloud.

â€œyer crawlinâ€™ little--, yer daresnâ€™t face me pro

 the speaking-tube.

â€œyes!â€ he said, and he listened. â€œer--yes!â€ he listened, then he
laughed. â€œiâ€™ll come down directly. iâ€™ve got a visitor just now.â€

dawes knew from his tone that he had been speaking to clara. he stepped
forward.

â€œyer little devil!â€ he said. â€œiâ€™ll visitor you, inside of two minutes!
think iâ€™m goinâ€™ to have you whipperty-snappinâ€™ round?â€

the other clerks in the warehouse looked up. paulâ€™s office-boy appeared,
holding some white article.

â€œfanny says you could have had it last night if youâ€™d let her know,â€ he
said.

â€œall right,â€ answered paul, looking at the stocking. â€œget it off.â€ dawes
stood frustrated, helpless with rage. morel turned round.

â€œexcuse me a minute,â€ he said to dawes, and he would have run
downstairs.

â€œby god, iâ€™ll stop your gallop!â€ shouted the smith, seizing him by the
arm. he turned quickly.

â€œhey! hey!â€ cried the office-boy, alarmed.

thomas jordan started out of his little glass office,

t?â€ said dawes, beginning to sneer.

mr. jordan started, marched up to the smith, waving him off, thrusting
his stout little figure at the man, saying:

â€œget off my premises--get off!â€

he seized and twitched dawesâ€™s arm.

â€œcome off!â€ said the smith, and with a jerk of the elbow he sent the
little manufacturer staggering backwards.

before anyone could help him, thomas jordan had collided with the flimsy
spring-door. it had given way, and let him crash down the half-dozen
steps into fannyâ€™s room. there was a second of amazement; then men and
girls were running. dawes stood a moment looking bitterly on the scene,
then he took his departure.

thomas jordan was shaken and braised, not otherwise hurt. he was,
however, beside himself with rage. he dismissed dawes from his
employment, and summoned him for assault.

at the trial paul morel had to give evidence. asked how the trouble
began, he said:

â€œdawes took occasion to insult mrs. dawes and me because i accompanied
her to the t
