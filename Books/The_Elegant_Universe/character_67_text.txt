y  stretching,  twisting,  or  crushing  them;  or  by  freezing,  heating,  or
burning them. during the past hundred years physicists have accumulated mounting evidence that all
of  these  interactions  between  various  objects  and  materials,  as  well  as  any  of  the  millions  upon
millions of others encountered daily, can be reduced to combinations of four fundamental forces. one
of these is the gravitational force. the other three are the electromagnetic force, the weak force, and
the strong force.

gravity is the most familiar of the forces, being responsible for keeping us in orbit around the
sun as well as for keeping our feet firmly planted on earth. the mass of an object measures how much
gravitational force it can exert as well as feel. the electromagnetic force is the next most familiar of
the  four.  it  is  the  force  driving  all  of  the  conveniences  of  modern  life—lights,  computers,  tvs,
telephones—and  underlies  the  awesome  might  of  lightning  storms  and  th

charges whose forces cancel each other out. on the other hand, since gravity is always attractive,
there are no analogous cancellations—more stuff means greater gravitational force. but fundamentally
speaking, gravity is an extremely feeble force. (this fact accounts for the difficulty in experimentally
confirming  the  existence  of  the  graviton.  searching  for  the  smallest  bundle  of  the  feeblest  force  is
quite a challenge.) experiments also have shown that the strong force is about one hundred times as
strong as the electromagnetic force and about one hundred thousand times as strong as the weak force.
but where is the rationale—the raison d'être—for our universe having these features?

this is not a question born of idle philosophizing about why certain details happen to be one
way instead of another; the universe would be a vastly different place if the properties of the matter
and force particles were even moderately changed. for example, the existence of

logical limit. for this reason, physicists call the theory of the three nongravitational forces and
the  three  families  of  matter  particles  the  standard  theory,  or  (more  often)  the standard  model  of
particle physics.

messenger particles

according to the standard model, just as the photon is the smallest constituent of an electromagnetic
field, the strong and the weak force fields have smallest constituents as well. as we discussed briefly
in chapter 1, the smallest bundles of the strong force are known as gluons, and those of the weak
force are known as weak gauge bosons (or more precisely, the w and z bosons). the standard model
instructs us to think of these force particles as having no internal structure—in this framework they
are every bit as elementary as the particles in the three families of matter.

the  photons,  gluons,  and  weak  gauge  bosons  provide  the  microscopic  mechanism  for
transmitting  the  forces  they  constitute.  for  example,  when  one  electrically

ther  the
transmitter of a message of how the recipient must respond to the force in question. for like-charged
particles,  the  photon  carries  the  message  "move  apart,"  while  for  oppositely  charged  particles  it
carries  the  message  "come  together."  for  this  reason  the  photon  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  the
messenger particle for the electromagnetic force. similarly, the gluons and weak gauge bosons are
the messenger particles for the strong and weak nuclear forces. the strong force, which keeps quarks
locked  up  inside  of  protons  and  neutrons,  arises  from  individual  quarks  exchanging  gluons.  the
gluons, so to speak, provide the "glue" that keeps these subatomic particles stuck together. the weak
force, which is responsible for certain kinds of particle transmutations involved in radioactive decay,
is mediated by the weak gauge bosons.

gauge symmetry

you may have realized that the odd man out in our discussion of the quantum theory of the forces of
nature is

symmetries, albeit ones that are significantly more abstract than the one associated with gravity.

to  get  a  rough  feel  for  these  rather  subtle  symmetry  principles,  let's  consider  one  important
example. as we recorded in the table in endnote 1 of chapter 1, each quark comes in three "colors"
(fancifully called red, green, and blue, although these are merely labels and have no relation to color
in the usual visual sense), which determine how it responds to the strong force in much the same way
that its electric charge determines how it responds to the electromagnetic force. all the data that have
been collected establish that there is a symmetry among the quarks in the sense that the interactions
between  any  two  like-colored  quarks  (red  with  red,  green  with  green,  or  blue  with  blue)  are  all
identical,  and  similarly,  the  interactions  between  any  two  unlike-colored  quarks  (red  with  green,
green with blue, or blue with red) are also ident

, and blue
were shifted, for instance, to yellow, indigo, and violet), and even if the details of this shift were to
change from moment to moment or from place to place, the interactions between the quarks would be,
again,  completely  unchanged.  for  this  reason,  just  as  we  say  that  a  sphere  exemplifies  rotational
symmetry because it looks the same regardless of how we rotate it around in our hands or how we
shift the angle from which we view it, we say that the universe exemplifies strong force symmetry:
physics  is  unchanged  by—it  is  completely  insensitive  to—these  force-charge  shifts.  for  historical
reasons, physicists also say that the strong force symmetry is an example of a gauge symmetry.5

the smallest bundle of a gravitational force field, the graviton, would be its messenger particle. at
first sight, as we now note, this suggestion would appear to be particularly apt because the quantum
field theory of the three nongravitational forces reveals that there is a ta

control system that keeps temperature, air pressure, and humidity in an area completely constant by
compensating perfectly for any exterior influences, certain kinds of force fields, according to yang
and mills, will provide perfect compensation for shifts in force charges, thereby keeping the physical
interactions  between  the  particles  completely  unchanged.  for  the  case  of  the  gauge  symmetry
associated with shifting quark-color charges, the required force is none other than the strong force
itself.  that  is,  without  the  strong  force,  physics would  change  under  the  kinds  of  shifts  of  color
charges indicated above. this realization shows that, although the gravitational force and the strong
force have vastly different properties (recall, for example, that gravity is far feebler than the strong
force and operates over enormously larger distances), they do have a somewhat similar heritage: they
are  each  required  in  order  that  the  universe  embody  particular  symm

blem for a number of years, until one day he came upon a striking revelation. much to his
surprise,  he  realized  that  an  esoteric  formula  concocted  for  purely  mathematical  pursuits  by  the
renowned swiss mathematician leonhard euler some two hundred years earlier—the so-called euler
beta-function—seemed to describe numerous properties of strongly interacting particles in one fell
swoop. veneziano's observation provided a powerful mathematical encapsulation of many features of
the strong force and it launched an intense flurry of research aimed at using euler's beta-function, and
various  generalizations,  to  describe  the  surfeit  of  data  being  collected  at  various  atom  smashers
around the world. nevertheless, there was a sense in which veneziano's observation was incomplete.
like memorized formulae used by a student who does not understand their meaning or justification,

string  description  of  the  strong  force  was  shown  to  fail.  during  the  early  1970s,  high-energy
experiments capable of probing the subatomic world more deeply showed that the string model made
a number of predictions that were in direct conflict with observations. at the same time, the point-
particle  quantum  field  theory  of  quantum  chromodynamics  was  being  developed,  and  its
overwhelming success in describing the strong force led to the dismissal of string theory.

most particle physicists thought that string theory had been relegated to the dustbin of science,
but a few dedicated researchers kept at it. schwarz, for instance, felt that "the mathematical structure
of string theory was so beautiful and had so many miraculous properties that it had to be pointing
toward something deep."2 one of the problems physicists found with string theory was that it seemed
to have a true embarrassment of riches. the theory contai

ned configurations of vibrating string that
had properties akin to those of gluons, substantiating its early claim of being a theory of the strong
force. but beyond these it contained additional messenger-like particles that did not appear to have
any relevance to experimental observations of the strong force. in 1974, schwarz and joël scherk of
the  ecole  normale  superieure  made  a  bold  leap  that  transformed  this  apparent  vice  into  a  virtue.
after  studying  the  puzzling  messenger-like  patterns  of  string  vibration,  they  realized  that  their
properties matched perfectly those of the hypothesized messenger particle of the gravitational force—
the  graviton. although  these  "smallest  bundles"  of  the  gravitational  force  have,  as  yet,  never  been

schwarz found these properties to be realized exactly by certain vibrational patterns. based on this,
scherk and schwarz suggested that string theory had failed in its initial attempt because physicists had
unduly constrained its scope. string theory is not just a theory of the strong force, they proclaimed; it
is a quantum theory that includes gravity as well.3

the  physics  community  did  not  receive  this  suggestion  with  unbridled  enthusiasm.  in  fact,
schwarz recounts that "our work was universally ignored."4 the path of progress was already littered
with numerous failed attempts to unite gravity and quantum mechanics. string theory had been shown
wrong in its initial effort to describe the strong force, and it seemed to many that it was senseless to

s upon the uncomfortably delicate numerical adjustments of the
ordinary standard model. although this is a highly technical issue, many particle physicists find that
this realization makes supersymmetry very attractive.

the third piece of circumstantial evidence for supersymmetry comes from the notion of grand
unification. one of the puzzling features of nature's four forces is the huge range in their intrinsic
strengths. the electromagnetic force has less than 1 percent of the strength of the strong force, the
weak  force  is  some  thousand  times  feebler  than  that,  and  the  gravitational  force  is  some  hundred
million billion billion billion (10-35) times weaker still. following the pathbreaking and ultimately
nobel  prize–winning  work  of  glashow,  salam,  and  weinberg  that  established  a  deep  connection
between the electromagnetic and weak forces (discussed in chapter 5), in 1974 glashow, together

tion might be forged
with the strong force. their work, which proposed a "grand unification" of three of the four forces,
differed in one essential way from that of the electroweak theory: whereas the electromagnetic and
weak forces crystallized out of a more symmetric union when the temperature of the universe dropped
to about a million billion degrees above absolute zero (1015 kelvin), georgi and glashow showed
that the union with the strong force would have been apparent only at a temperature some ten trillion
times higher—around ten billion billion billion degrees above absolute zero (1028 kelvin). from the
point of view of energy, this is about a million billion times the mass of the proton, or about four
orders of magnitude less than the planck mass. georgi and glashow boldly took theoretical physics
into  an  energy  realm  many  orders  of  magnitude  beyond  that  which  anyone  had  previously  dared
explore.

s that whereas in chapter 7 we noted that everything we know points
toward  a  consistent  and  uniform  physics  throughout  our  universe,  this  may  have  no  bearing  on  the
physical attributes in these other universes so long as they are separate from us, or at least so far
away that their light has not had time to reach us. and so we can imagine that physics varies from one
universe to another. in some, the differences may be subtle: for example, the electron mass or the
strength of the strong force might be a thousandth of a percent larger or smaller than in our universe.
in others, physics may differ in more pronounced ways: the up-quark might weigh ten times what it
weighs in our universe, or the strength of the electromagnetic force might be ten times the value we
measure,  with  all  the  profound  implications  that  this  has  on  stars  and  on  life  as  we  know  it  (as
indicated in chapter 1). and in other universes, physics may differ in still more dramatic ways: the

5.  for  the  mathematically  inclined  reader,  we  note  that  the  symmetry  principles  used  in
elementary  particle  physics  are  generally  based  on  groups,  most  notably,  lie  groups.  elementary
particles  are  arranged  in  representations  of  various  groups  and  the  equations  governing  their  time
evolution are required to respect the associated symmetry transformations. for the strong force, this
symmetry is called su(3) (the analog of ordinary three-dimensional rotations, but acting on a complex
space), and the three colors of a given quark species transform in a three-dimensional representation.
the shifting (from red, green, blue to yellow, indigo, violet) mentioned in the text is, more precisely,
an su(3) transformation acting on the "color coordinates" of a quark. a gauge symmetry is one in
which the group transformations can have a spacetime dependence: in this case, "rotati
