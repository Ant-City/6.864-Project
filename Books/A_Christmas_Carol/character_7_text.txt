n the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and
good-humour. when scrooge's nephew laughed in this way: holding
his sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face into the
most extravagant contortions: scrooge's niece, by marriage,
laughed as heartily as he. and their assembled friends being
not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.

"ha, ha! ha, ha, ha, ha!"

"he said that christmas was a humbug, as i live!" cried
scrooge's nephew. "he believed it too!"

"more shame for him, fred!" said scrooge's niece,
indignantly. bless those women; they never do anything by
halves. they are always in earnest.

she was very pretty: exceedingly pretty. with a dimpled,
surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that
seemed made to be kissed--as no doubt it was; all kinds of
good little dots about her chin, that melted into one another
when she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever
saw in any little creature's head. altogether she was what
you would have ca

lled provoking, you know; but satisfactory, too.
oh, perfectly satisfactory.

"he's a comical old fellow," said scrooge's nephew, "that's
the truth: and not so pleasant as he might be. however,
his offences carry their own punishment, and i have nothing
to say against him."

"i'm sure he is very rich, fred," hinted scrooge's niece.
"at least you always tell me so."

"what of that, my dear!" said scrooge's nephew. "his
wealth is of no use to him. he don't do any good with it.
he don't make himself comfortable with it. he hasn't the
satisfaction of thinking--ha, ha, ha!--that he is ever going
to benefit us with it."

"i have no patience with him," observed scrooge's niece.
scrooge's niece's sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed
the same opinion.

"oh, i have!" said scrooge's nep

re clustered round the fire, by lamplight.

"well! i'm very glad to hear it," said scrooge's nephew,
"because i haven't great faith in these young housekeepers.
what do you say, topper?"

topper had clearly got his eye upon one of scrooge's niece's
sisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast,
who had no right to express an opinion on the subject.
whereat scrooge's niece's sister--the plump one with the lace
tucker: not the one with the roses--blushed.

"do go on, fred," said scrooge's niece, clapping her hands.
"he never finishes what he begins to say! he is such a
ridiculous fellow!"

scrooge's nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was
impossible to keep the infection off; though the plump sister
tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was
unanimously followed.

"i was only going to say," said scrooge's nephew, "that
the consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making
merry with us, is, as i think, that he loses som

didn't live in a menagerie, and was never killed in a market,
and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a
tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. at every fresh
question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a
fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that
he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp. at last
the plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out:

"i have found it out! i know what it is, fred! i know
what it is!"

"what is it?" cried fred.

"it's your uncle scro-o-o-o-oge!"

which it certainly was. admiration was the universal
sentiment, though some objected that the reply to "is it a
bear?" ought to have been "yes;" inasmuch as an answer
in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts
from mr. scrooge, supposing they had ever had any tendency
that way.

"he has given us plenty of merriment, i am sure," said
fred, "and it would be ungrateful not to drin

"where is he, my love?" said scrooge.

"he's in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. i'll
show you up-stairs, if you please."

"thank'ee. he knows me," said scrooge, with his hand
already on the dining-room lock. "i'll go in here, my dear."

he turned it gently, and sidled his face in, round the door.
they were looking at the table (which was spread out in
great array); for these young housekeepers are always nervous
on such points, and like to see that everything is right.

"fred!" said scrooge.

dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started!
scrooge had forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting
in the corner with the footstool, or he wouldn't have done
it, on any account.

"why bless my soul!" cried fred, "who's that?"

"it's i. your uncle scrooge. i have come to dinner.
will you let me in, fred?"

let him in! it is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off.
he was at home in five minutes. nothing could be heartier.
his niece looked just the same. so d
