[CHARACTER] - 
                the
king of israel and the founder of jerusalem, or "zion." [CHARACTER]'s
reign marks the high point of israel in the biblical narrative.
although [CHARACTER]'s claim to the throne is threatened by saul and by
[CHARACTER]'s own son, absalom, [CHARACTER] maintains his power by blending shrewd
political maneuvering with a magnanimous and forgiving treatment
of his enemies. [CHARACTER]'s decision to bring the ark of the covenant--israel's symbol
of god--to the capital of jerusalem signals the long-awaited unification
of the religious and political life of israel in the promised land.
