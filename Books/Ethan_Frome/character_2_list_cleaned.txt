[CHARACTER]  - 
                zeena's
cousin, who comes to assist the fromes with their domestic tasks.
attractive, young, and energetic, mattie becomes the object of ethan's affection,
and reciprocates his infatuation. because the reader sees mattie
only through ethan's own lovesick eyes, mattie never truly emerges
as a well-rounded character. she often seems more a focus for ethan's rebellion
against zeena and starkfield than an actual flesh-and-blood person
with both strengths and weaknesses.
