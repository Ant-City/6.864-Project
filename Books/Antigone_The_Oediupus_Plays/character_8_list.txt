Theseus - 
                	The
king of Athens in Oedipus at Colonus. A renowned
and powerful warrior, Theseus takes pity on Oedipus and defends
him against Creon. Theseus is the only one who knows the spot at
which Oedipus descended to the underworld--a secret he promises Oedipus
he will hold forever.
