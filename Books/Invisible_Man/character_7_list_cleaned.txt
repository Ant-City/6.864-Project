[CHARACTER] - 
a preacher from chicago who visits the narrator's
college. reverend barbee's fervent praise of the founder's "vision"
strikes an inadvertently ironic note, because he himself is blind.
with barbee's first name, ellison makes reference to the greek poet homer,
another blind orator who praised great heroes in his epic poems.
ellison uses barbee to satirize the college's desire to transform
the founder into a similarly mythic hero.
