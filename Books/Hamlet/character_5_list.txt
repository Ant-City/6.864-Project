Ophelia - 
                	Polonius's
daughter, a beautiful young woman with whom Hamlet has been in love.
Ophelia is a sweet and innocent young girl, who obeys her father
and her brother, Laertes. Dependent on men to tell her how to behave,
she gives in to Polonius's schemes to spy on Hamlet. Even in her
lapse into madness and death, she remains maidenly, singing songs
about flowers and finally drowning in the river amid the flower
garlands she had gathered.
