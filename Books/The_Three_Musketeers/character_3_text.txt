complained of having a cold, and coughed from time to time affectedly.
it was for this reason, as he said to those around him, that he had put
on his cloak; and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted his
mustache disdainfully, all admired his embroidered baldric, and
dâ€™artagnan more than anyone.

"what would you have?" said the musketeer. "this fashion is coming in.
it is a folly, i admit, but still it is the fashion. besides, one must
lay out oneâ€™s inheritance somehow."

"ah, porthos!" cried one of his companions, "donâ€™t try to make us
believe you obtained that baldric by paternal generosity. it was given
to you by that veiled lady i met you with the other sunday, near the
gate st. honor."

"no, upon honor and by the faith of a gentleman, i bought it with the
contents of my own purse," answered he whom they designated by the name
porthos.

"yes; about in the same manner," said another musketeer, "that i bought
this new purse with what my mistress put into the old one."

"

itâ€™s true, though," said porthos; "and the proof is that i paid twelve
pistoles for it."

the wonder was increased, though the doubt continued to exist.

"is it not true, aramis?" said porthos, turning toward another
musketeer.

this other musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator, who
had just designated him by the name of aramis. he was a stout man, of
about two- or three-and-twenty, with an open, ingenuous countenance, a
black, mild eye, and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn peach. his
delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip;
he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell,
and he pinched the tips of his ears from

he answered the appeal of his friend by an affirmative nod of the head.

this affirmation appeared to dispel all doubts with regard to the
baldric. they continued to admire it, but said no more about it; and
with a rapid change of thought, the conversation passed suddenly to
another subject.

"what do you think of the story chalaisâ€™s esquire relates?" asked
another musketeer, without addressing anyone in particular, but on the
contrary speaking to everybody.

"and what does he say?" asked porthos, in a self-sufficient tone.

"he relates that he met at brussels rochefort, the ame damnee of the
cardinal disguised as a capuchin, and that this cursed rochefort, thanks
to his disguise, had tricked monsieur de laigues, like a ninny as he
is."

"a ninny, indeed!" said porthos; "but is the matter certain?"

"i had it from aramis," replied the musketeer.

"indeed?"

"why, you knew it, porthos," said aramis. "i told you of it yesterday.
let us say no more about it."

"say no more about it? thatâ€

"say no more about it! peste! you come to your conclusions quickly.
what! the cardinal sets a spy upon a gentleman, has his letters stolen
from him by means of a traitor, a brigand, a rascal--has, with the help
of this spy and thanks to this correspondence, chalaisâ€™s throat cut,
under the stupid pretext that he wanted to kill the king and marry
monsieur to the queen! nobody knew a word of this enigma. you unraveled
it yesterday to the great satisfaction of all; and while we are still

"well, then, let us talk about it, since you desire it," replied aramis,
patiently.

"this rochefort," cried porthos, "if i were the esquire of poor chalais,
should pass a minute or two very uncomfortably with me."

"and you--you would pass rather a sad quarter-hour with the red duke,"
replied aramis.

"oh, the red duke! bravo! bravo! the red duke!" cried porthos, clapping
his hands and nodding his head. "the red duke is capital. iâ€™ll circulate
that saying, be assured, my dear fellow. who says this aramis is not a
wit? what a misfortune it is you did not follow your first vocation;
what a delicious abbe you would have made!"

"oh, itâ€™s only a temporary postponement," replied aramis; "i shall be
one someday. you very well know, porthos, that i continue to study
theology for that purpose."

"he will be one, as he says," cried porthos; "he will be one,

"sooner," said aramis.

"he only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock,
which hangs behind his uniform," said another musketeer.

"what is he waiting for?" asked another.

"only till the queen has given an heir to the crown of france."

"no jesting upon that subject, gentlemen," said porthos; "thank god the
queen is still of an age to give one!"

"they say that monsieur de buckingham is in france," replied aramis,
with a significant smile which gave to this sentence, apparently so
simple, a tolerably scandalous meaning.

"aramis, my good friend, this time you are wrong," interrupted porthos.
"your wit is always leading you beyond bounds; if monsieur de treville
heard you, you would repent of speaking thus."

"are you going to give me a lesson, porthos?" cried aramis, from whose

useless; you know what is agreed upon between you, athos and me. you go
to madame dâ€™aguillonâ€™s, and you pay your court to her; you go to madame

being far advanced in the good graces of that lady. oh, good lord! donâ€™t

virtue, why the devil donâ€™t you make use of it with respect to her

respectfully."

"porthos, you are as vain as narcissus; i plainly tell you so," replied
aramis. "you know i hate moralizing, except when it is done by athos. as
to you, good sir, you wear too magnificent a baldric to be strong on
that head. i will be an abbe if it suits me. in the meanwhile i am a
musketeer; in that quality i say what i please, and at this moment it
pleases me to say that you weary me."

g dâ€™artagnanâ€™s response, the bearnese accent of which
recalled to him at the same time his youth and his country--a double
remembrance which makes a man smile at all ages; but stepping toward the
antechamber and making a sign to dâ€™artagnan with his hand, as if to ask
his permission to finish with others before he began with him, he called
three times, with a louder voice at each time, so that he ran through
the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry
accent.

"athos! porthos! aramis!"

the two musketeers with whom we have already made acquaintance, and who
answered to the last of these three names, immediately quitted the group
of which they had formed a part, and advanced toward the cabinet, the
door of which closed after them as soon as they had entered. their
appearance, although it was not quite at ease, excited by its
carelessness, at once full of dignity and submission, the admiration of
dâ€™artagnan, who beheld in these two men demigods, and in their leader

when the two musketeers had entered; when the door was closed behind
them; when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber, to which the summons
which had been made had doubtless furnished fresh food, had recommenced;
when m. de treville had three or four times paced in silence, and with a
frowning brow, the whole length of his cabinet, passing each time before
porthos and aramis, who were as upright and silent as if on parade--he
stopped all at once full in front of them, and covering them from head
to foot with an angry look, "do you know what the king said to me,"
cried he, "and that no longer ago than yesterday evening--do you know,
gentlemen?"

"no," replied the two musketeers, after a momentâ€™s silence, "no, sir, we
do not."

"but i hope that you will do us the honor to tell us," added aramis, in
his politest tone and with his most graceful bow.

"he t

the guards of monsieur the cardinal."

"the guards of the cardinal! and why so?" asked porthos, warmly.

"because he plainly perceives that his piquette* stands in need of being
enlivened by a mixture of good wine."

_*a watered liquor, made from the second pressing of the grape._

the two musketeers reddened to the whites of their eyes. dâ€™artagnan did
not know where he was, and wished himself a hundred feet underground.

"yes, yes," continued m. de treville, growing warmer as he spoke, "and
his majesty was right; for, upon my honor, it is true that the

but itâ€™s all my fault; yes, itâ€™s all my fault, because it is myself who
selects my men. you, aramis, why the devil did you ask me for a uniform
when you would have been so much better in a cassock? and you, porthos,
do you only wear such a fine golden baldric to suspend a sword of straw
from it? and athos--i donâ€™t see athos. where is he?"

"ill--"

"very ill, say you? and of what malady?"

"it is feared that it may be the smallpox, sir," replied porthos,
desirous of taking his turn in the conversation; "and what is serious is
that it will certainly spoil his face."

"the smallpox! thatâ€™s a great story to tell me, porthos! sick of the

themselves to be arrested, to laugh at you! i am sure of it--they would
prefer dying on the spot to being arrested or taking back a step. to
save yourselves, to scamper away, to flee--that is good for the kingâ€™s
musketeers!"

porthos and aramis trembled with rage. they could willingly have
strangled m. de treville, if, at the bottom of all this, they had not
felt it was the great love he bore them which made him speak thus. they
stamped upon the carpet with their feet; they bit their lips till the
blood came, and grasped the hilts of their swords with all their might.

at these words, the murmur without became an explosion; nothing was to
be heard but oaths and blasphemies. the morbleus, the sang dieus, the
morts touts les diables, crossed one another in the air. dâ€™artagnan
looked for some tapestry behind which he might hide himself, and felt an
immense inclination to crawl under the table.

"well, my captain," said porthos, quite beside himself, "the truth is
that we were six against six. but we were not captured by fair means;
and before we had time to draw our swords, two of our party were dead,
and athos, grievously wounded, was very little better. for you know
athos. well, captain, he endeavored twice to get up, and fell again

the way we escaped. as for athos, they believed him to be dead, and left

king to shut the door against anyone, and all
crowded round the wounded man. but all this eager attention might have
been useless if the doctor so loudly called for had not chanced to be in
the hotel. he pushed through the crowd, approached athos, still
insensible, and as all this noise and commotion inconvenienced him
greatly, he required, as the first and most urgent thing, that the
musketeer should be carried into an adjoining chamber. immediately m. de
treville opened and pointed the way to porthos and aramis, who bore
their comrade in their arms. behind this group walked the surgeon; and
behind the surgeon the door closed.

the cabinet of m. de treville, generally held so sacred, became in an
instant the annex of the antechamber. everyone spoke, harangued, and
vociferated, swearing, cursing, and consigning the cardinal and his
guards to all the devils.

an instant after, porthos and aramis re-entered, the surgeon and m. de
treville alone remaining with the wounded.

become crimson with passion, and rush from the cabinet crying, "sâ€™blood,
he shall not escape me this time!"

"and who?" asked m. de treville.

"he, my thief!" replied dâ€™artagnan. "ah, the traitor!" and he
disappeared.

"the devil take the madman!" murmured m. de treville, "unless," added
he, "this is a cunning mode of escaping, seeing that he had failed in
his purpose!"




4 the shoulder of athos, the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of
aramis


dâ€™artagnan, in a state of fury, crossed the antechamber at three bounds,
and was darting toward the stairs, which he reckoned upon descending
four at a time, when, in his heedless course, he ran head foremost
against a musketeer who was coming out of one of m. de trevilleâ€™s
private rooms, and striking his shoulder violently, made him utter a
cry, or rather a howl.

"excuse me," said dâ€™artagnan, endeavoring to resume his course, "excuse
me, but i am in a hu

ng--me, you
understand?"

"and where, i pray you?"

"near the carmes-deschaux."

"at what hour?"

"about noon."

"about noon? that will do; i will be there."

"endeavor not to make me wait; for at quarter past twelve i will cut off
your ears as you run."

"good!" cried dâ€™artagnan, "i will be there ten minutes before twelve."
and he set off running as if the devil possessed him, hoping that he
might yet find the stranger, whose slow pace could not have carried him
far.

but at the street gate, porthos was talking with the soldier on guard.
between the two talkers there was just enough room for a man to pass.
dâ€™artagnan thought it would suffice for him, and he sprang forward like
a dart between them. but dâ€™artagnan had reckoned without the wind. as he
was about to pass, the wind blew out porthosâ€™s long cloak, and
dâ€™artagnan rushed straight into the middle of it. without doubt, porthos
had reasons for not abandoning this part of his vestments, for instead
of quitting his hold on the fl

ap in his hand, he pulled it toward him,
so that dâ€™artagnan rolled himself up in the velvet by a movement of
rotation explained by the persistency of porthos.

dâ€™artagnan, hearing the musketeer swear, wished to escape from the
cloak, which blinded him, and sought to find his way from under the
folds of it. he was particularly anxious to avoid marring the freshness
of the magnificent baldric we are acquainted with; but on timidly
opening his eyes, he found himself with his nose fixed between the two
shoulders of porthos--that is to say, exactly upon the baldric.

alas, like most things in this world which have nothing in their favor
but appearances
 
 ___________________________
 
, the baldric was glittering with gold in the front, but
was nothing but simple buff behind. vainglorious as he was, porthos
could not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold, but had at least
half. one could comprehend the necessity of the cold and the urgency of
the cloak.

"bless me!" cried porthos, making strong efforts to disembarrass himself
of dâ€™artagnan, who was wriggling about his back; "you must be mad to run
against people in this manner."

"excuse me," said dâ€™artagnan, reappearing under the shoulder of the
giant, "but i am in such haste--i was running after someone and--"

"and do you always forget your eyes when you run?" asked porthos.

"no," replied dâ€™artagnan, piqued, "and thanks to my eyes, i can see what
other people cannot see."

whether porthos understood him or did

 not understand him, giving way to
his anger, "monsieur," said he, "you stand a chance of getting chastised
if you rub musketeers in this fashion."

"chastised, monsieur!" said dâ€™artagnan, "the expression is strong."

"it is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the
face."

"ah, pardieu! i know full well that you donâ€™t turn your back to yours."

and the young man, delighted with his joke, went away laughing loudly.

porthos foamed with rage, and made a movement to rush after dâ€™artagnan.

"presently, presently," cried the latter, "when you havenâ€™t your cloak
on."

"at one oâ€™clock, then, behind the luxembourg."

"very well, at one oâ€™clock, then," replied dâ€™artagnan, turning the angle
of the street.

but neither in the street he had passed through, nor in the one which
his eager glance pervaded, could he see anyone; however slowly the
stranger had walked, he was gone on his way, or perhaps had entered some

who could not fail to think the manner in which dâ€™artagnan had left him
a little cavalier.

besides this, he had drawn upon himself two good duels with two men,
each capable of killing three dâ€™artagnans--with two musketeers, in
short, with two of those beings whom he esteemed so greatly that he
placed them in his mind and heart above all other men.

the outlook was sad. sure of being killed by athos, it may easily be
understood that the young man was not very uneasy about porthos. as
hope, however, is the last thing extinguished in the heart of man, he
finished by hoping that he might survive, even though with terrible
wounds, in both these duels; and in case of surviving, he made the
following reprehensions upon his own conduct:

"what a madcap i was, and what a stupid fellow i am! that brave and
unfortunate athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which i must
run head foremost, like a ram. the only thing that astonishes me is that
he did not strike me dead at

once. he had good cause to do so; the pain
i gave him must have been atrocious. as to porthos--oh, as to porthos,
faith, thatâ€™s a droll affair!"

and in spite of himself, the young man began to laugh aloud, looking
round carefully, however, to see that his solitary laugh, without a
cause in the eyes of passers-by, offended no one.

"as to porthos, that is certainly droll; but i am not the less a giddy
fool. are people to be run against without warning? no! and have i any
right to go and peep under their cloaks to see what is not there? he
would have pardoned me, he would certainly have pardoned me, if i had
not said anything to him about that cursed baldric--in ambiguous words,
it is true, but rather drolly ambiguous. ah, cursed gascon that i am, i

rdinary man; therefore, while repeating to himself that his death was
inevitable, he did not make up his mind to die quietly, as one less
courageous and less restrained might have done in his place. he
reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going
to fight, and began to view his situation more clearly. he hoped, by
means of loyal excuses, to make a friend of athos, whose lordly air and
austere bearing pleased him much. he flattered himself he should be able
to frighten porthos with the adventure of the baldric, which he might,
if not killed upon the spot, relate to everybody a recital which, well
managed, would cover porthos with ridicule. as to the astute aramis, he
did not entertain much dread of him; and supposing he should be able to
get so far, he determined to dispatch him in good style or at least, by
hitting him in the face, as caesar recommended his soldiers do to those
of pompey, to damage forever the beauty of which he was so proud.

in addition to this, d

"there is another word which pleases me," cried athos, with a gracious
nod to dâ€™artagnan. "that did not come from a man without a heart.
monsieur, i love men of your kidney; and i foresee plainly that if we
donâ€™t kill each other, i shall hereafter have much pleasure in your
conversation. we will wait for these gentlemen, so please you; i have
plenty of time, and it will be more correct. ah, here is one of them, i
believe."

in fact, at the end of the rue vaugirard the gigantic porthos appeared.

"what!" cried dâ€™artagnan, "is your first witness monsieur porthos?"

"yes, that disturbs you?"

"by no means."

"and here is the second."

dâ€™artagnan turned in the direction pointed to by athos, and perceived
aramis.

"what!" cried he, in an accent of greater astonishment than before,
"your second witness is monsieur aramis?"

"doubtless! are you not aware that we are never seen one without the
others, and that we are called among the musketeers and the guards, at
court and in th

e city, athos, porthos, and aramis, or the three
inseparables? and yet, as you come from dax or pau--"

"from tarbes," said dâ€™artagnan.

"it is probable you are ignorant of this little fact," said athos.

"my faith!" replied dâ€™artagnan, "you are well named, gentlemen; and my
adventure, if it should make any noise, will prove at least that your
union is not founded upon contrasts."

in the meantime, porthos had come up, waved his hand to athos, and then
turning toward dâ€™artagnan, stood quite astonished.

let us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and relinquished
his cloak.

"ah, ah!" said he, "what does this mean?"

"this is the gentleman i am going to fight with," said athos, pointing
to dâ€™artagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same gesture.

"why, it is with him i am also going to fight," said porthos.

"but not before one oâ€™clock," replied dâ€™artagnan.

"and i also 
 
 ___________________________
 
am to fight with this gentleman," said aramis, coming in his
turn onto the place.

"but not until two oâ€™clock," said dâ€™artagnan, with the same calmness.

"but what are you going to fight about, athos?" asked aramis.

"faith! i donâ€™t very well know. he hurt my shoulder. and you, porthos?"

"faith! i am going to fight--because i am going to fight," answered
porthos, reddening.

athos, whose keen eye lost nothing, perceived a faintly sly smile pass
over the lips of the young gascon as he replied, "we had a short
discussion upon dress."

"and you, aramis?" asked athos.

"oh, ours is a theological quarrel," replied aramis, making a sign to
dâ€™artagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel.

athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of dâ€™artagnan.

"indeed?" said athos.

"yes; a passage of st. augustine, upon which we could not agree," said
the gascon.

 
 ___________________________
 

"decidedly, this is a clever fellow," murmured athos.

"and now you are assembled, gentlemen," said dâ€™artagnan, "permit me to
offer you my apologies."

at this word apologies, a cloud passed over the brow of athos, a haughty
smile curled the lip of porthos, and a negative sign was the reply of
aramis.

"you do not understand me, gentlemen," said dâ€™artagnan, throwing up his
head, the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a
bright ray of the sun. "i asked to be excused in case i should not be
able to discharge my debt to all three; for monsieur athos has the right
to kill me first, which must much diminish the face-value of your bill,
monsieur porthos, and render yours almost null, monsieur aramis. and
now, gentlemen, i repea
 
 ___________________________
 
t, excuse me, but on that account only, and--on
guard!"

at these words, with the most gallant air possible, dâ€™artagnan drew his
sword.

the blood had mounted to the head of dâ€™artagnan, and at that moment he
would have drawn his sword against all the musketeers in the kingdom as
willingly as he now did against athos, porthos, and aramis.

it was a quarter past midday. the sun was in its zenith, and the spot
chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ardor.

"it is very hot," said athos, drawing his sword in its turn, "and yet i
cannot take off my doublet; for i just now felt my wound begin to bleed
again, and i should not like to annoy monsieur with the sight of blood
which he has not drawn from me himself."

"that is true, monsieur," replied dâ€™artagnan, "and whether drawn by
myself or another, i as

sure you i shall always view with regret the
blood of so brave a gentleman. i will therefore fight in my doublet,
like yourself."

"come, come, enough of such compliments!" cried porthos. "remember, we
are waiting for our turns."

"speak for yourself when you are inclined to utter such incongruities,"
interrupted aramis. "for my part, i think what they say is very well
said, and quite worthy of two gentlemen."

"when you please, monsieur," said athos, putting himself on guard.

"i waited your orders," said dâ€™artagnan, crossing swords.

but scarcely had the two rapiers clashed, when a company of the guards
of his eminence, commanded by m. de jussac, turned the corner of the
co

nvent.

"the cardinalâ€™s guards!" cried aramis and porthos at the same time.
"sheathe your swords, gentlemen, sheathe your swords!"

but it was too late. the two combatants had been seen in a position
which left no doubt of their intentions.

"halloo!" cried jussac, advancing toward them and making a sign to his
men to do so likewise, "halloo, musketeers? fighting here, are you? and
the edicts? what is become of them?"

"you are very generous, gentlemen of the guards," said athos, full of
rancor, for jussac was one of the aggressors of the preceding da

 invitation if it depended upon ourselves;
but unfortunately the thing is impossible--monsieur de treville has
forbidden it. pass on your way, then; it is the best thing to do."

this raillery exasperated jussac. "we will charge upon you, then," said
he, "if you disobey."

"there are five of them," said athos, half aloud, "and we are but three;
we shall be beaten again, and must die on the spot, for, on my part, i
declare i will never appear again before the captain as a conquered
man."

athos, porthos, and aramis instantly drew near one another, while jussac
drew up his soldiers.

this short interval was sufficient to determine dâ€™artagnan on the part
he was to take. it was one of those events which decide the life of a
man; it was a choice between the king and the cardinal--the choice made,
it must be persisted in. to fight, that was to disobey the law, that was
to risk his head, that was to make at one blow an enemy of a minister
more powerful than the king himself. all this the young man

 perceived,
and yet, to his praise we speak it, he did not hesitate a second.
turning towards athos and his friends, "gentlemen," said he, "allow me
to correct your words, if you please. you said you were but three, but
it appears to me we are four."

"but you are not one of us," said porthos.

"thatâ€™s true," replied dâ€™artagnan; "i have not the uniform, but i have
the spirit. my heart is that of a musketeer; i feel it, monsieur, and
that impels me on."

"withdraw, young man," cried jussac, who doubtless, by his gestures and
the expression of his countenance, had guessed dâ€™artagnanâ€™s design. "you
may retire; we consent to that. save your skin; begone quickly."

dâ€™artagnan did not budge.

"decidedly, you are a brave fellow," said athos, pressing the young
manâ€™s hand.

"com

e, come, choose your part," replied jussac.

"well," said porthos to aramis, "we must do something."

"monsieur is full of generosity," said athos.

but all three reflected upon the youth of dâ€™artagnan, and dreaded his
inexperience.

"we should only be three, one of whom is wounded, with the addition of a
boy," resumed athos; "and yet it will not be the less said we were four
men."

"yes, but to yield!" said porthos.

"that is difficult," replied athos.

dâ€™artagnan comprehended their irresolution.

"try me, gentlemen," said he, "and i swear to you by my honor that i
will not go hence if we are conquered."

"what is your name, my brave fellow?" said athos.

"dâ€™artagnan, monsieur."

"well, then, athos, porthos, aramis, and dâ€™artagnan, forward!" cried
athos.

"come, gentlemen, have you decided?" cried jussac for the third time.

"it is done, gentlemen," said athos.

"and what is your choice?" asked juss

"we are about to have the honor of charging you," replied aramis,
lifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the other.

"ah! you resist, do you?" cried jussac.

"sâ€™blood; does that astonish you?"

and the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which however
did not exclude a certain degree of method.

athos fixed upon a certain cahusac, a favorite of the cardinalâ€™s.
porthos had bicarat, and aramis found himself opposed to two
adversaries. as to dâ€™artagnan, he sprang toward jussac himself.

the heart of the young gascon beat as if it would burst through his
side--not from fear, god be thanked, he had not the shade of it, but
with emulation; he fought like a furious tiger, turning ten times round
his adversary, and changing his ground and his guard twenty times.
jussac was, as was then said, a fine blade, and had had much practice;
nevertheless it required all his

this, springing forward, aimed a terrible thrust at his adversary, but
the latter parried it; and while jussac was recovering himself, glided
like a serpent beneath his blade, and passed his sword through his body.
jussac fell like a dead mass.

dâ€™artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of
battle.

aramis had killed one of his adversaries, but the other pressed him
warmly. nevertheless, aramis was in a good situation, and able to defend
himself.

bicarat and porthos had just made counterhits. porthos had received a
thrust through his arm, and bicarat one through his thigh. but neither
of these two wounds was serious, and they only fought more earnestly.

athos, wounded anew by cahusac, became evidently paler, but did not give
way a foot. he only changed his sword hand, and fought with his left
hand.

according to the laws of dueling at that period, dâ€™artagnan was at
liberty to assist whom he pleased. while he was endeavoring to find out
which of his comp

t on his way he met athos,
who during his relief which dâ€™artagnan had procured him had recovered
his breath, and who, for fear that dâ€™artagnan would kill his enemy,
wished to resume the fight.

dâ€™artagnan perceived that it would be disobliging athos not to leave him
alone; and in a few minutes cahusac fell, with a sword thrust through
his throat.

at the same instant aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his
fallen enemy, and forced him to ask for mercy.

there only then remained porthos and bicarat. porthos made a thousand
flourishes, asking bicarat what oâ€™clock it could be, and offering him
his compliments upon his brotherâ€™s having just obtained a company in the
regiment of navarre; but, jest as he might, he gained nothing. bicarat
was one of those iron men who never fell dead.

nevertheless, it was necessary to finish. the watch might come up and
take all the combatants, wounded or not, royalists or cardinalists.

was only wounded, under the porch of the convent. the fourth, as we have
said, was dead. they then rang the bell, and carrying away four swords
out of five, they took their road, intoxicated with joy, toward the
hotel of m. de treville.

they walked arm in arm, occupying the whole width of the street and
taking in every musketeer they met, so that in the end it became a
triumphal march. the heart of dâ€™artagnan swam in delirium; he marched
between athos and porthos, pressing them tenderly.

"if i am not yet a musketeer," said he to his new friends, as he passed
through the gateway of m. de trevilleâ€™s hotel, "at least i have entered
upon my apprenticeship, havenâ€™t i?"

this affair made a great noise. m. de treville scolded his musketeers in
public, and congratulated them in private; but as no time was to be lost
in gaining the king, m. de treville hastened to report himself at the
louvre. it was already too late. the

"yes, sire, as they always do."

"and how did the thing happen? let us see, for you know, my dear
captain, a judge must hear both sides."

"good lord! in the most simple and natural manner possible. three of my
best soldiers, whom your majesty knows by name, and whose devotedness
you have more than once appreciated, and who have, i dare affirm to the
king, his service much at heart--three of my best soldiers, i say,
athos, porthos, and aramis, had made a party of pleasure with a young
fellow from gascony, whom i had introduced to them the same morning. the
party was to take place at st. germain, i believe, and they had
appointed to meet at the carmes-deschaux, when they were disturbed by de
jussac, cahusac, bicarat, and two other guardsmen, who certainly did not
go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against
the edicts."

"ah, ah! you incline me to think so," said the king. "there is no doubt

 took leave of him.

that evening the three musketeers were informed of the honor accorded
them. as they had long been acquainted with the king, they were not much
excited; but dâ€™artagnan, with his gascon imagination, saw in it his
future fortune, and passed the night in golden dreams. by eight oâ€™clock
in the morning he was at the apartment of athos.

dâ€™artagnan found the musketeer dressed and ready to go out. as the hour
to wait upon the king was not till twelve, he had made a party with
porthos and aramis to play a game at tennis in a tennis court situated
near the stables of the luxembourg. athos invited dâ€™artagnan to follow
them; and although ignorant of the game, which he had never played, he
accepted, not knowing what to do with his time from nine oâ€™clock in the
morning, as it then scarcely was, till twelve.

the two musketeers were already there, and were playing together. athos,
who was very expert in all bodily exercises, passed with dâ€™artagnan to
the opposite side and ch

allenged them; but at the first effort he made,
although he played with his left hand, he found that his wound was yet
too recent to allow of such exertion. dâ€™artagnan remained, therefore,
alone; and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it
regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without
counting. but one of these balls, launched by porthosâ€™ herculean hand,
passed so close to dâ€™artagnanâ€™s face that he thought that if, instead of
passing near, it had hit him, his audience would have been probably
lost, as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before
the king. now, as upon this audience, in his gascon imagination,
depended his future life, he saluted aramis and porthos politely,
declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared
to play with them on more equal terms, and went and took hi

you."

"do not hurry yourself, monsieur, lest it be observed that we go out
together. you must be aware that for our undertaking, company would be
in the way."

"thatâ€™s true," said the guardsman, astonished that his name had not
produced more effect upon the young man.

indeed, the name of bernajoux was known to all the world, dâ€™artagnan
alone excepted, perhaps; for it was one of those which figured most
frequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts of the cardinal
could not repress.

porthos and aramis were so engaged with their game, and athos was
watching them with so much attention, that they did not even perceive
their young companion go out, who, as he had told the guardsman of his
eminence, stopped outside the door. an instant after, the guardsman
descended in his turn. as dâ€™artagnan had no time to lose, on account of
the audience of the king, which was fixed for midday, he cast his eyes
around, and seeing that the street was empty, said to his adversary, "my
faith! it is f

e la tremouille, in whose service he had a
relative, dâ€™artagnan was ignorant of the seriousness of the last wound
his adversary had received, and pressing him warmly, without doubt would
soon have completed his work with a third blow, when the noise which
arose from the street being heard in the tennis court, two of the
friends of the guardsman, who had seen him go out after exchanging some
words with dâ€™artagnan, rushed, sword in hand, from the court, and fell
upon the conqueror. but athos, porthos, and aramis quickly appeared in
their turn, and the moment the two guardsmen attacked their young
companion, drove them back. bernajoux now fell, and as the guardsmen
were only two against four, they began to cry, "to the rescue! the hotel
de la tremouille!" at these cries, all who were in the hotel rushed out
and fell upon the four companions, who on their side cried aloud, "to
the rescue, musketeers!"

this cry was generally heeded; for the musketeers were known to be
enemies of the cardinal,

ok leave of m. de la tremouille, returned to his hotel,
and immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited their
company at dinner.

m de treville entertained good company, wholly anticardinalist, though.
it may easily be understood, therefore, that the conversation during the
whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his eminenceâ€™s guardsmen
had received. now, as dâ€™artagnan had been the hero of these two fights,
it was upon him that all the felicitations fell, which athos, porthos,
and aramis abandoned to him, not only as good comrades, but as men who
had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his.

toward six oâ€™clock m. de treville announced that it was time to go to
the louvre; but as the hour of audience granted by his majesty was past,
instead of claiming the entree by the back stairs, he placed himself
with the four young men in the antechamber. the king had not yet
returned from hunting. our young men had been waiting about half an
hour, ami

d holding a whip in his hand. at the
first glance, dâ€™artagnan judged that the mind of the king was stormy.

this disposition, visible as it was in his majesty, did not prevent the
courtiers from ranging themselves along his pathway. in royal
antechambers it is worth more to be viewed with an angry eye than not to
be seen at all. the three musketeers therefore did not hesitate to make
a step forward. dâ€™artagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind
them; but although the king knew athos, porthos, and aramis personally,
he passed before them without speaking or looking--indeed, as if he had
never seen them before. as for m. de treville, when the eyes of the king
fell upon him, he sustained the look with so much firmness that it was
the king who dropped his eyes; after which his majesty, grumbling,
entered his apartment.

"matters go but badly," said athos, smiling; "and we shall not be made
chevaliers of the order this time."

"wait here ten minutes," said m. de treville; "and if at the

"sire," replied m. de treville, calmly, "on the contrary, i come to
demand it of you."

"and against whom?" cried the king.

"against calumniators," said m. de treville.

"ah! this is something new," replied the king. "will you tell me that
your three damned musketeers, athos, porthos, and aramis, and your
youngster from bearn, have not fallen, like so many furies, upon poor
bernajoux, and have not maltreated him in such a fashion that probably
by this time he is dead? will you tell me that they did not lay siege to
the hotel of the duc de la tremouille, and that they did not endeavor to
burn it?--which would not, perhaps, have been a great misfortune in time
of war, seeing that it is nothing but a nest of huguenots, but which is,
in time of peace, a frightful example. tell

this did not prevent the king from being as complacent to him as
possible whenever he met him, or from asking in the kindest tone, "well,
monsieur cardinal, how fares it with that poor jussac and that poor
bernajoux of yours?"




7 the interior* of the musketeers


when dâ€™artagnan was out of the louvre, and consulted his friends upon
the use he had best make of his share of the forty pistoles, athos
advised him to order a good repast at the pomme-de-pin, porthos to
engage a lackey, and aramis to provide himself with a suitable mistress.

_*domestic affairs, housekeeping_

the repast was carried into effect that very day, and the lackey waited
at table. the repast had been ordered by athos, and the lackey furnished
by porthos. he was a picard, whom the glorious musketeer had picked up
on the bridge tournelle, making rings and plashing in the water.

porthos pretended that this occupation was proof of a reflective and
contemplative organization, and he h
 
 ___________________________
 
ad brought him away without any
other recommendation. the noble carriage of this gentleman, for whom he
believed himself to be engaged, had won planchet--that was the name of
the picard. he felt a slight disappointment, however, when he saw that
this place was already taken by a compeer named mousqueton, and when
porthos signified to him that the state of his household, though great,
would not support two servants, and that he must enter into the service
of dâ€™artagnan. nevertheless, when he waited at the dinner given by his
master, and saw him take out a handful of gold to pay for it, he
believed his fortune made, and returned thanks to heaven for having
thrown him into the service of such a croesus. he preserved this opinion
even after the feast, with the remnants of which he repaired his own
long abstinence

onsisted of an antechamber and a bedroom. planchet
slept in the antechamber upon a coverlet taken from the bed of
dâ€™artagnan, and which dâ€™artagnan from that time made shift to do
without.

athos, on his part, had a valet whom he had trained in his service in a
thoroughly peculiar fashion, and who was named grimaud. he was very
taciturn, this worthy signor. be it understood we are speaking of athos.
during the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest intimacy
with his companions, porthos and aramis, they could remember having
often seen him smile, but had never heard him laugh. his words were
brief and expressive, conveying all that was meant, and no more; no
embellishments, no embroidery, no arabesques. his conversation was a
matter of fact, without a single romance.

although athos was scarcely thirty years old, and was of great personal
beauty and intelligence of mind, no one knew whether he had ever had a
mistress. he never spoke of women. he certainly did not prevent other
 
 ___________________________
 
a simple movement of his lips. he never spoke
to him, except under the most extraordinary occasions.

sometimes, grimaud, who feared his master as he did fire, while
entertaining a strong attachment to his person and a great veneration
for his talents, believed he perfectly understood what he wanted, flew
to execute the order received, and did precisely the contrary. athos
then shrugged his shoulders, and, without putting himself in a passion,
thrashed grimaud. on these days he spoke a little.

porthos, as we have seen, had a character exactly opposite to that of
athos. he not only talked much, but he talked loudly, little caring, we
must render him that justice, whether anybody listened to him or not. he
talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing
himself talk. he spoke upon all subjects except the sciences, alleging
in this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his
childhood. he had not so noble an air as athos, and the commencement of
their inti

macy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman, whom he
endeavored to eclipse by his splendid dress. but with his simple
musketeerâ€™s uniform and nothing but the manner in which he threw back
his head and advanced his foot, athos instantly took the place which was
his due and consigned the ostentatious porthos to the second rank.
porthos consoled himself by filling the antechamber of m. de treville
and the guardroom of the louvre with the accounts of his love scrapes,
after having passed from professional ladies to military ladies, from
the lawyerâ€™s dame to the baroness, there was question of nothing less
with porthos than a foreign princess, who was enormously fond of him.

an old proverb says, "like master, like man." let us pass, then, from
the valet of athos to the valet of porthos, from grimaud to mousqueton.

mousqueton
 
 ___________________________
 
 was a norman, whose pacific name of boniface his master had
changed into the infinitely more sonorous name of mousqueton. he had
entered the service of porthos upon condition that he should only be
clothed and lodged, though in a handsome manner; but he claimed two
hours a day to himself, consecrated to an employment which would provide
for his other wants. porthos agreed to the bargain; the thing suited him
wonderfully well. he had doublets cut out of his old clothes and
cast-off cloaks for mousqueton, and thanks to a very intelligent tailor,
who made his clothes look as good as new by turning them, and whose wife
was suspected of wishing to make porthos descend from his aristocratic
habits, mousqueton made a very good figure when attending on his master.

as for aramis, of whom we believe we have sufficiently explained the
character--a character which, 
 
 ___________________________
 
ung and still really
handsome, cast tender glances uselessly at him. some fragments of past
splendor appeared here and there upon the walls of this modest lodging;
a sword, for example, richly embossed, which belonged by its make to the
times of francis i, the hilt of which alone, encrusted with precious
stones, might be worth two hundred pistoles, and which, nevertheless, in
his moments of greatest distress athos had never pledged or offered for
sale. it had long been an object of ambition for porthos. porthos would
have given ten years of his life to possess this sword.

one day, when he had an appointment with a duchess, he endeavored even
to borrow it of athos. athos, without saying anything, emptied his
pockets, got together all his jewels, purses, aiguillettes, and gold
chains, and offered them all to porthos; but as to the sword, he said it
was sealed to its place and should never quit it until its master should
himself quit his lodgings. in addition to the sword, there was a
portrait 
 
 ___________________________
 
 wore the order of the holy ghost; and
this portrait had certain resemblances of lines with athos, certain
family likenesses which indicated that this great noble, a knight of the
order of the king, was his ancestor.

besides these, a casket of magnificent goldwork, with the same arms as
the sword and the portrait, formed a middle ornament to the mantelpiece,
and assorted badly with the rest of the furniture. athos always carried
the key of this coffer about him; but he one day opened it before
porthos, and porthos was convinced that this coffer contained nothing
but letters and papers--love letters and family papers, no doubt.

porthos lived in an apartment, large in size and of very sumptuous
appearance, in the rue du vieux-colombier. every time he passed with a
friend before his windows, at one of which mousqueton was sure to be
placed in full livery, porthos raised his head and his hand, and said,
"that is my abode!" but he was never to be found at home; he never
invited anybody to go up

 lodging composed of a boudoir, an
eating room, and a bedroom, which room, situated, as the others were, on
the ground floor, looked out upon a little fresh green garden, shady and
impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors.

with regard to dâ€™artagnan, we know how he was lodged, and we have
already made acquaintance with his lackey, master planchet.

dâ€™artagnan, who was by nature very curious--as people generally are who
possess the genius of intrigue--did all he could to make out who athos,
porthos, and aramis really were (for under these pseudonyms each of
these young men concealed his family name)--athos in particular, who, a
league away, savored of nobility. he addressed himself then to porthos
to gain information respecting athos and aramis, and to aramis in order
to learn something of porthos.

unfortunately porthos knew nothing of the life of his silent companion
but what revealed itself. it was said athos had met with great crosses
in love, and that a frightful treachery had foreve

r poisoned the life of
this gallant man. what could this treachery be? all the world was
ignorant of it.

as to porthos, except his real name (as was the case with those of his
two comrades), his life was very easily known. vain and indiscreet, it
was as easy to see through him as through a crystal. the only thing to
mislead the investigator would have been belief in all the good things
he said of himself.

with respect to aramis, though having the air of having nothing secret
about him, he was a young fellow made up of mysteries, answering little
to questions put to him about others, and having learned from him

 the
report which prevailed concerning the success of the musketeer with a
princess, wished to gain a little insight into the amorous adventures of
his interlocutor. "and you, my dear companion," said he, "you speak of
the baronesses, countesses, and princesses of others?"

"pardieu! i spoke of them because porthos talked of them himself,
because he had paraded all these fine things before me. but be assured,
my dear monsieur dâ€™artagnan, that if i had obtained them from any other
source, or if they had been confided to me, there exists no confessor
more discreet than myself."

"oh, i donâ€™t doubt that," replied dâ€™artagnan; "but it seems to me that
you are tolerably familiar with coats of arms--a certain embroidered
handkerchief, for instance, to which i owe the honor of your
acquaintance?"

and left at my house by one of my friends. i was obliged to pick it up
in order not to compromise him and the lady he loves. as for myself, i
neither have, nor desire to have, a mistress, following in that respect
the very judicious example of athos, who has none any more than i have."

"but what the devil! you are not a priest, you are a musketeer!"

"a musketeer for a time, my friend, as the cardinal says, a musketeer
against my will, but a churchman at heart, believe me. athos and porthos
dragged me into this to occupy me. i had, at the moment of being
ordained, a little difficulty with--but that would not interest you, and
i am taking up your valuable time."

"not at all; it interests me very much," cried dâ€™artagnan; "and at this
moment i have absolutely nothing to do."

"yes, but i have my breviary to repeat," answered aramis; "then some
verses to compose, which madame dâ€™aiguillon begged of me. then i must go
to the rue st. honore in order to purchase some rouge for madame
 
 ___________________________
 
friend, that if you are not in a hurry, i
am very much in a hurry."

aramis held out his hand in a cordial manner to his young companion, and
took leave of him.

notwithstanding all the pains he took, dâ€™artagnan was unable to learn
any more concerning his three new-made friends. he formed, therefore,
the resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their
past, hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the future. in
the meanwhile, he looked upon athos as an achilles, porthos as an ajax,
and aramis as a joseph.

as to the rest, the life of the four young friends was joyous enough.
athos played, and that as a rule unfortunately. nevertheless, he never
borrowed a sou of his companions, although his purse was ever at their
service; and when he had played upon honor, he always awakened his
creditor by six oâ€™clock the next morning to pay the debt of the
preceding evening.

attraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation, believed they had
two or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table, aramis looked at
his watch, arose with a bland smile, and took leave of the company, to
go, as he said, to consult a casuist with whom he had an appointment. at
other times he would return home to write a treatise, and requested his
friends not to disturb him.

at this athos would smile, with his charming, melancholy smile, which so
became his noble countenance, and porthos would drink, swearing that
aramis would never be anything but a village cure.

planchet, dâ€™artagnanâ€™s valet, supported his good fortune nobly. he
received thirty sous per day, and for a month he returned to his
lodgings gay as a chaffinch, and affable toward his master. when the
wind of adversity began to blow upon the housekeeping of the rue des
fossoyeurs--that is to say, when the forty pistoles of king louis xiii
were consumed or nearly so--he commenced complaints which athos thought
nau
 
 ___________________________
 
seous, porthos indecent, and aramis ridiculous. athos counseled
dâ€™artagnan to dismiss the fellow; porthos was of the opinion that he
should give him a good thrashing first; and aramis contended that a
master should never attend to anything but the civilities paid to him.

"this is all very easy for you to say," replied dâ€™artagnan, "for you,
athos, who live like a dumb man with grimaud, who forbid him to speak,
and consequently never exchange ill words with him; for you, porthos,
who carry matters in such a magnificent style, and are a god to your
valet, mousqueton; and for you, aramis, who, always abstracted by your
theological studies, inspire your servant, bazin, a mild, religious man,
with a profound respect; but for me, who am without any settled means
and without resources--for me, who am neither a musketeer nor even a
guardsman, what am i to do to inspire either the affection, the terror,
or the respect in planchet?"

"this is serious," answered the three friend

donned his uniform, which he would have exchanged for that of a
musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence. but m. de
treville promised this favor after a novitiate of two years--a novitiate
which might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself
for dâ€™artagnan to render the king any signal service, or to distinguish
himself by some brilliant action. upon this promise dâ€™artagnan withdrew,
and the next day he began service.

then it became the turn of athos, porthos, and aramis to mount guard
with dâ€™artagnan when he was on duty. the company of m. le chevalier
dessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted
dâ€™artagnan.




8 concerning a court intrigue


in the meantime, the forty pistoles of king louis xiii, like all other
things of this world, after having had a beginning had an end, and after
this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed. at first,
athos supported the association for a time with his own means.

good grace and who succeeded--as he said, by selling some theological
books--in procuring a few pistoles.

then, as they had been accustomed to do, they had recourse to m. de
treville, who made some advances on their pay; but these advances could
not go far with three musketeers who were already much in arrears and a
guardsman who as yet had no pay at all.

at length when they found they were likely to be really in want, they
got together, as a last effort, eight or ten pistoles, with which
porthos went to the gaming table. unfortunately he was in a bad vein; he
lost all, together with twenty-five pistoles for which he had given his
word.

then the inconvenience became distress. the hungry friends, followed by
their lackeys, were seen haunting the quays and guard rooms, picking up
among their friends abroad all the dinners they could meet with; for
according to the advice of aramis, it was prudent to sow repasts right
and left in prosperity, in order to reap a few in time of need.

athos

was invited four times, and each time took his friends and their
lackeys with him. porthos had six occasions, and contrived in the same
manner that his friends should partake of them; aramis had eight of
them. he was a man, as must have been already perceived, who made but
little noise, and yet was much sought after.

as to dâ€™artagnan, who as yet knew nobody in the capital, he only found
one chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province,
and one dinner at the house of a cornet of the guards. he took his army
to the priestâ€™s, where they devoured as much provisio

lasted him for two months, and to the cornetâ€™s, who performed wonders;
but as planchet said, "people do not eat at once for all time, even when
they eat a good deal."

dâ€™artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal
and a half for his companions--as the breakfast at the priestâ€™s could
only be counted as half a repast--in return for the feasts which athos,
porthos, and aramis had procured him. he fancied himself a burden to the
society, forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith that he had fed
this society for a month; and he set his mind actively to work. he
reflected that this coalition of four young, brave, enterprising, and
active men ought to have some other object than swaggering walks,
fencing lessons, and practical jokes, more or less witty.

in fact, four men such as they were--four men devoted to one another,

"what!" demanded dâ€™artagnan.

"whom do i see yonder?"

"where?"

"in the street, facing your window, in the embrasure of that door--a man
wrapped in a cloak."

"it is he!" cried dâ€™artagnan and the citizen at the same time, each
having recognized his man.

"ah, this time," cried dâ€™artagnan, springing to his sword, "this time he
will not escape me!"

drawing his sword from its scabbard, he rushed out of the apartment. on
the staircase he met athos and porthos, who were coming to see him. they
separated, and dâ€™artagnan rushed between them like a dart.

"pah! where are you going?" cried the two musketeers in a breath.

"the man of meung!" replied dâ€™artagnan, and disappeared.

dâ€™artagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with
the stranger, as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner, to
whom this man had confided some important missive.

the opinion of athos was that dâ€™artagnan had lost his letter in the
skirmish.
 
 ___________________________
 
 a gentleman, in his opinion--and according to dâ€™artagnanâ€™s
portrait of him, the stranger must be a gentleman--would be incapable of
the baseness of stealing a letter.

porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting, given by a lady to a
cavalier, or by a cavalier to a lady, which had been disturbed by the
presence of dâ€™artagnan and his yellow horse.

aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious, it was
better not to fathom them.

they understood, then, from the few words which escaped from dâ€™artagnan,
what affair was in hand, and as they thought that overtaking his man, or
losing sight of him, dâ€™artagnan would return to his rooms, they kept on

their way.

when they entered dâ€™artagnanâ€™s chamber, it was empty; the landlord,
dreading the consequences of the encounter which was doubtless about to
take place between the young man and the stranger, had, consistent with
the character he had given himself, judged it prudent to decamp.




9 dâ€™artagnan shows himself


as athos and porthos had foreseen, at the expiration of a half hour,
dâ€™artagnan returned. he had again missed his man, who had disappeared as
if by enchantment. dâ€™artagnan had run, sword in hand, through all the
neighboring streets, but had found nobody resembling the man he sought
for. then he came back to the point where, perhaps, he ought to have
begun, and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had
leaned; but this proved useless--for though he knocked ten or twelve
times in succession, no

 the streets and knocking at doors,
aramis had joined his companions; so that on returning home dâ€™artagnan
found the reunion complete.

"well!" cried the three musketeers all together, on seeing dâ€™artagnan
enter with his brow covered with perspiration and his countenance upset
with anger.

"well!" cried he, throwing his sword upon the bed, "this man must be the
devil in person; he has disappeared like a phantom, like a shade, like a
specter."

"do you believe in apparitions?" asked athos of porthos.

"i never believe in anything i have not seen, and as i never have seen
apparitions, i donâ€™t believe in them."

"the bible," said aramis, "makes our belief in them a law; the ghost of
samuel appeared to saul, and it is an article of faith that i should be
very sorry to see any doubt thrown upon, porthos."

"at all events, man or devil, body or shadow, illusion or reality, this
man is born for my damnation; for his flight has caused us to miss a
glorious affair, gentlemen--an affair by which

there were a hundred
pistoles, and perhaps more, to be gained."

"how is that?" cried porthos and aramis in a breath.

as to athos, faithful to his system of reticence, he contented himself
with interrogating dâ€™artagnan by a look.

"planchet," said dâ€™artagnan to his domestic, who just then insinuated
his head through the half-open door in order to catch some fragments of
the conversation, "go down to my landlord, monsieur bonacieux, and ask
him to send me half a dozen bottles of beaugency wine; i prefer that."

"ah, ah! you have credit with your landlord, then?" asked porthos.

"yes
 
 ___________________________
 
," replied dâ€™artagnan, "from this very day; and mind, if the wine is
bad, we will send him to find better."

"we must use, and not abuse," said aramis, sententiously.

"i always said that dâ€™artagnan had the longest head of the four," said
athos, who, having uttered his opinion, to which dâ€™artagnan replied with
a bow, immediately resumed his accustomed silence.

"but come, what is this about?" asked porthos.

"yes," said aramis, "impart it to us, my dear friend, unless the honor
of any lady be hazarded by this confidence; in that case you would do
better to keep it to yourself."

"be satisfied," replied dâ€™artagnan; "the honor of no one will have cause
to complain of what i have to tell."

he then related to his friends, word for word, all that had passed
between him and his host, and how the man who had abducted the wife of
his worthy landlord was the same with whom he had had the difference at

english?"

"spain is her country," replied dâ€™artagnan; "and it is very natural that
she should love the spanish, who are the children of the same soil as
herself. as to the second reproach, i have heard it said that she does
not love the english, but an englishman."

"well, and by my faith," said athos, "it must be acknowledged that this
englishman is worthy of being loved. i never saw a man with a nobler air
than his."

"without reckoning that he dresses as nobody else can," said porthos. "i
was at the louvre on the day when he scattered his pearls; and, pardieu,
i picked up two that i sold for ten pistoles each. do you know him,
aramis?"

"as well as you do, gentlemen; for i was among those who seized him in
the garden at amiens, into which monsieur putange, the queenâ€™s equerry,
introduced me. i was at school at the time, and the adventure appeared
to me to be cruel for the king."

"which would not prevent me," said dâ€™artagnan, "if i knew where the duke
of buckingham was, 
 
 ___________________________
 
from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the
queen, were it only to enrage the cardinal, and if we could find means
to play him a sharp turn, i vow that i would voluntarily risk my head in
doing it."

"and did the mercer*," rejoined athos, "tell you, dâ€™artagnan, that the
queen thought that buckingham had been brought over by a forged letter?"

_*haberdasher_

"she is afraid so."

"wait a minute, then," said aramis.

"what for?" demanded porthos.

"go on, while i endeavor to recall circumstances."

"and now i am convinced," said dâ€™artagnan, "that this abduction of the
queenâ€™s woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking, and
perhaps with the presence of buckingham in paris."

"the gascon is full of ideas," said porthos, with admiration.

"i like to hear him talk," said athos; "his dialect amuses me."

"gentlemen," cried aramis, "listen to this."

"listen to aramis," said his three friends.

"yesterday i was at the ho

on require it. now, at the moment when i left his house--"

here aramis paused.

"well," cried his auditors; "at the moment you left his house?"

aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort, like a man who, in the
full relation of a falsehood, finds himself stopped by some unforeseen
obstacle; but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him,
their ears were wide open, and there were no means of retreat.

"this doctor has a niece," continued aramis.

"ah, he has a niece!" interrupted porthos.

"a very respectable lady," said aramis.

the three friends burst into laughter.

"ah, if you laugh, if you doubt me," replied aramis, "you shall know
nothing."

"we believe like mohammedans, and are as mute as tombstones," said
athos.

"i will continue, then," resumed aramis. "this niece comes sometimes to
see her uncle; and by chance was there yesterday at the same time that i
was, and it was my duty to offer to conduct her to her carriage."

"ah! she has a carriage, then, this niece of the

doctor?" interrupted
porthos, one of whose faults was a great looseness of tongue. "a nice
acquaintance, my friend!"

"porthos," replied aramis, "i have had the occasion to observe to you
more than once that you are very indiscreet; and that is injurious to
you among the women."

"gentlemen, gentlemen," cried dâ€™artagnan, who began to get a glimpse of
the result of the adventure, "the thing is serious. let us try not to
jest, if we can. go on aramis, go on."

"all at once, a tall, dark gentleman--just like yours, dâ€™artagnan."

"the same, perhaps," said he.

"possibly," continued aramis, "came toward me, accompanied 
 
 ___________________________
 
by five or
six men who followed about ten paces behind him; and in the politest
tone, â€™monsieur duke,â€™ said he to me, â€™and you madame,â€™ continued he,
addressing the lady on my arm--"

"the doctorâ€™s niece?"

"hold your tongue, porthos," said athos; "you are insupportable."

"â€™--will you enter this carriage, and that without offering the least
resistance, without making the least noise?â€™"

"he took you for buckingham!" cried dâ€™artagnan.

"i believe so," replied aramis.

"but the lady?" asked porthos.

"he took her for the queen!" said dâ€™artagnan.

"just so," replied aramis.

"the gascon is the devil!" cried athos; "nothing escapes him."

"the fact is," said porthos, "aramis is of the same height, and
something of the 
 
 ___________________________
 
shape of the duke; but it nevertheless appears to me
that the dress of a musketeer--"

"i wore an enormous cloak," said aramis.

"in the month of july? the devil!" said porthos. "is the doctor afraid
that you may be recognized?"

"i can comprehend that the spy may have been deceived by the person; but
the face--"

"i had a large hat," said aramis.

"oh, good lord," cried porthos, "what precautions for the study of
theology!"

"gentlemen, gentlemen," said dâ€™artagnan, "do not let us lose our time in
jesting. let us separate, and let us seek the mercerâ€™s wife--that is the
key of the intrigue."

"a woman of such inferior condition! can you believe so?" said porthos,
protruding his lips with contempt.

"she is goddaughter to laporte, the confidential valet of the queen.
have i not told you so, gentlemen? besides, it has perhaps been her
majestyâ€™s calculation to seek o

high heads expose themselves from afar, and the cardinal is
longsighted."

"well," said porthos, "in the first place make a bargain with the
mercer, and a good bargain."

"thatâ€™s useless," said dâ€™artagnan; "for i believe if he does not pay us,
we shall be well enough paid by another party."

at this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs;
the door was thrown violently open, and the unfortunate mercer rushed
into the chamber in which the council was held.

"save me, gentlemen, for the love of heaven, save me!" cried he. "there
are four men come to arrest me. save 
 
 ___________________________
 
me! save me!"

porthos and aramis arose.

"a moment," cried dâ€™artagnan, making them a sign to replace in the
scabbard their half-drawn swords. "it is not courage that is needed; it
is prudence."

"and yet," cried porthos, "we will not leave--"

"you will leave dâ€™artagnan to act as he thinks proper," said athos. "he
has, i repeat, the longest head of the four, and for my part i declare
that i will obey him. do as you think best, dâ€™artagnan."

at this moment the four guards appeared at the door of the antechamber,
but seeing four musketeers standing, and their swords by their sides,
they hesitated about going farther.

"come in, gentlemen, come in," called dâ€™artagnan; "you are here in my
apartment, and we a

re all faithful servants of the king and cardinal."

"then, gentlemen, you will not oppose our executing the orders we have
received?" asked one who appeared to be the leader of the party.

"on the contrary, gentlemen, we would assist you if it were necessary."

"what does he say?" grumbled porthos.

"you are a simpleton," said athos. "silence!"

"but you promised me--" whispered the poor mercer.

"we can only save you by being free ourselves," replied dâ€™artagnan, in a
rapid, low tone; "and if we appear inclined to defend you, they will
arrest us with you."

"it seems, nevertheless--"

"come, gentlemen, come!" said dâ€™artagnan, aloud; "i have no motive for
defending monsieur. i saw him today for the first time, and he can tell
you on what occasion; he came to demand the rent of my lodg

your name?"

"boisrenard."

"monsieur boisrenard."

"to yours, my gentlemen! what is your name, in your turn, if you
please?"

"dâ€™artagnan."

"to yours, monsieur."

"and above all others," cried dâ€™artagnan, as if carried away by his
enthusiasm, "to that of the king and the cardinal."

the leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of
dâ€™artagnan if the wine had been bad; but the wine was good, and he was
convinced.

"what diabolical villainy you have performed here," said porthos, when
the officer had rejoined his companions and the four friends found
themselves alone. "shame, shame, for four musketeers to allow an
unfortunate fellow who cried for help to be arrested in their midst! and
a gentleman to hobnob with a bailiff!"

"porthos," said aramis, "athos has already told you that you are a
simpleton, and i am quite of his opinion. dâ€™artagnan, you are a great
man; and when you occupy monsieur de trevilleâ€™s place, i will come and
ask your influence to secure me an a

bbey."

"well, i am in a maze," said porthos; "do you approve of what dâ€™artagnan
has done?"

"parbleu! indeed i do," said athos; "i not only approve of what he has
done, but i congratulate him upon it."

"and now, gentlemen," said dâ€™artagnan, without stopping to explain his
conduct to porthos, "all for one, one for all--that is our motto, is it
not?"

"and yet--" said porthos.

"hold out your hand and swear!" cried athos and aramis at once.

overcome by example, grumbling to himself, nevertheless, porthos
stretched out his hand, and the four friends repeated with one voice the
formula dictated by dâ€™artagnan:

"all for one, one for all."

"thatâ€™s well! now let us everyone retire to his own home," said
dâ€™artagnan, as if he had done nothing but command all his life; "and
attention! for from this moment we are at feud with the cardinal."

the voice became more and more indistinct; a tumultuous movement shook
the partition. the victim resisted as much as a woman could resist four
men.

"pardon, gentlemen--par--" murmured the voice, which could now only be
heard in inarticulate sounds.

"they are binding her; they are going to drag her away," cried
dâ€™artagnan to himself, springing up from the floor. "my sword! good, it
is by my side! planchet!"

"monsieur."

"run and seek athos, porthos and aramis. one of the three will certainly
be at home, perhaps all three. tell them to take arms, to come here, and
to run! ah, i remember, athos is at monsieur de trevilleâ€™s."

"but where are you going, monsieur, where are you going?"

"i am going down by the window, in order to be there the sooner," cried
dâ€™artagnan. "you put back the boards, sweep the floor, go out at the
door, and run as i told you."

"oh, monsieur! monsieur! you will kill yourself," cried planchet.

herself; and although it is generally with her husbandâ€™s money that she
procures herself this indulgence, the gratitude for it seldom reverts to
him.

then dâ€™artagnan, disposed to become the most tender of lovers, was at
the same time a very devoted friend. in the midst of his amorous
projects for the mercerâ€™s wife, he did not forget his friends. the
pretty mme. bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the plain st.
denis or in the fair of st. germain, in company with athos, porthos, and
aramis, to whom dâ€™artagnan had often remarked this. then one could enjoy
charming little dinners, where one touches on one side the hand of a
friend, and on the other the foot of a mistress. besides, on pressing
occasions, in extreme difficulties, dâ€™artagnan would become the
preserver of his friends.

and m. bonacieux, whom dâ€™artagnan had pushed into the hands of the
officers, denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to
save him? we are compelled to admit to our reader

"bravo, athos! noble heart!" murmured dâ€™artagnan. "i know him well
there! and what did the officers do?"

"four conveyed him away, i donâ€™t know where--to the bastille or fort
lâ€™eveque. two remained with the men in black, who rummaged every place
and took all the papers. the last two mounted guard at the door during
this examination; then, when all was over, they went away, leaving the
house empty and exposed."

"and porthos and aramis?"

"i could not find them; they did not come."

"but they may come any moment, for you left word that i awaited them?"

"yes, monsieur."

"well, donâ€™t budge, then; if they come, tell them what has happened. let
them wait for me at the pomme-de-pin. here it would be dangerous; the
house may be watched. i will run to monsieur de treville to tell them
all this, and will meet them there."

"very well, monsieur," said planchet.

"but you will remain; you are not afraid?" said dâ€™artagn

his naked sword under his arm, allowed the duke and
mme. bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead, and then followed them, ready
to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of charles
i.

fortunately, he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his
devotion, and the young woman and the handsome musketeer entered the
louvre by the wicket of the echelle without any interference.

as for dâ€™artagnan, he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the
pomme-de-pin, where he found porthos and aramis awaiting him. without
giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused
them, he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he
had for a moment believed he should need their assistance.

meanwhile, carried away as we are by our narrative, we must leave our
three friends to themselves, and follow the duke of buckingham and his
guide through the labyrinths of the louvre.

here is what the letter contained:

to him as you can, and cut off two.

as soon as these studs shall be in your possession, inform me.

on the day after these events had taken place, athos not having
reappeared, m. de treville was informed by dâ€™artagnan and porthos of the
circumstance. as to aramis, he had asked for leave of absence for five
days, and was gone, it was said, to rouen on family business.

m de treville was the father of his soldiers. the lowest or the least
known of them, as soon as he assumed the uniform of the company, was as
sure of his aid and support as if he had been his own brother.

mme. bonacieux made no reply; but her heart beat with joy and secret

"and what guarantee will you give me," asked she, "if i consent to

"my love for you. speak! command! what is to be done?"

"my god, my god!" murmured the young woman, "ought i to confide such a
secret to you, monsieur? you are almost a boy."

"i see that you require someone to answer for me?"

"i admit that would reassure me greatly."

"do you know athos?"

"no."

"porthos?"

"no."

"aramis?"

"no. who are these gentleman?"

"three of the kingâ€™s musketeers. do you know monsieur de treville, their
captain?"

"oh, yes, him! i know him; not personally, but from having heard the
queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman."

"you do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal?"

"oh, no, certainly not!"

"well, reveal your secret to him, and ask him whether, however
important, however valuable, however terrible it may be, you may not

"is the young guardsman at home?"

"i do not think he is; as you see, his shutter is closed, and you can

"all the same, it is well to be certain."

"how so?"

"by knocking at his door. go."

"i will ask his servant."

bonacieux re-entered the house, passed through the same door that had
afforded a passage for the two fugitives, went up to dâ€™artagnanâ€™s door,
and knocked.

no one answered. porthos, in order to make a greater display, had that
evening borrowed planchet. as to dâ€™artagnan, he took care not to give
the least sign of existence.

the moment the hand of bonacieux sounded on the door, the two young
people felt their hearts bound within them.

"there is nobody within," said bonacieux.

"never mind. let us return to your apartment. we shall be safer there
than in the doorway."

"ah, my god!" whispered mme. bonacieux, "we shall hear no more."

"on the contrary," said dâ€™artagnan

and you are going alone?"

"i am going alone."

"in that case you will not get beyond bondy. i tell you so, by the faith
of de treville."

"how so?"

"you will be assassinated."

"and i shall die in the performance of my duty."

"but your mission will not be accomplished."

"that is true," replied dâ€™artagnan.

"believe me," continued treville, "in enterprises of this kind, in order
that one may arrive, four must set out."

"ah, you are right, monsieur," said dâ€™artagnan; "but you know athos,
porthos, and aramis, and you know if i can dispose of them."

"without confiding to them the secret which i am not willing to know?"

"we are sworn, once for all, to implicit confidence and devotedness
against all proof. besides, you can tell them that you have full
confidence in me, and they will not be more incredulous than you."

"i can send to each of them leave of absence for fifteen days, that is
all--to athos, whose wound still makes him suffer, to go to the waters
of forges; to porthos and aram

to see if he could not find stray coin. when well assured this search
was superfluous, he followed dâ€™artagnan, wondering to himself how this
young guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had
given hospitality, and that he should know better than himself what had
become of her.

only as they went out aramis placed his hand upon the arm of dâ€™artagnan,
and looking at him earnestly, "you have not spoken of this lady?" said
he.

"to nobody in the world."

"not even to athos or porthos?"

"i have not breathed a syllable to them."

"good enough!"

tranquil on this important point, aramis continued his way with
dâ€™artagnan, and both soon arrived at athosâ€™s dwelling. they found him
holding his leave of absence in one hand, and m. de trevilleâ€™s note in
the other.

"can you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this
letter, which i have just received?" said the astonished athos.

my dear athos,

"well, this leave of absence and that letter mean that you must follow
me, athos."

"to the waters of forges?"

"there or elsewhere."

"in the kingâ€™s service?"

"either the kingâ€™s or the queenâ€™s. are we not their majestiesâ€™
servants?"

at that moment porthos entered. "pardieu!" said he, "here is a strange
thing! since when, i wonder, in the musketeers, did they grant men leave
of absence without their asking for it?"

"since," said dâ€™artagnan, "they have friends who ask it for them."

"ah, ah!" said porthos, "it appears thereâ€™s something fresh here."

"yes, we are going--" said aramis.

"to what country?" demanded porthos.

"my faith! i donâ€™t know much about it," said athos. "ask dâ€™artagnan."

"to london, gentlemen," said dâ€™artagnan.

"to
 
 ___________________________
 
 london!" cried porthos; "and what the devil are we going to do in
london?"

"that is what i am not at liberty to tell you, gentlemen; you must trust
to me."

"but in order to go to london," added porthos, "money is needed, and i
have none."

"nor i," said aramis.

"nor i," said athos.

"i have," replied dâ€™artagnan, pulling out his treasure from his pocket,
and placing it on the table. "there are in this bag three hundred
pistoles. let each take seventy-five; that is enough to take us to
london and back. besides, make yourselves easy; we shall not all arrive
at london."

"why so?"

"because, in all probability, some one of us will be left on the road."

"is this, then, a campaign upon which we

 are now entering?"

"one of a most dangerous kind, i give you notice."

"ah! but if we do risk being killed," said porthos, "at least i should
like to know what for."

"you would be all the wiser," said athos.

"and yet," said aramis, "i am somewhat of porthosâ€™s opinion."

"is the king accustomed to give you such reasons? no. he says to you
jauntily, â€™gentlemen, there is fighting going on in gascony or in
flanders; go and fight,â€™ and you go there. why? you need give yourselves
no more uneasiness about this."

"dâ€™artagnan is right," said athos; "here are our three leaves of absence
which came from monsieur de treville, and here are three hundred
pistoles which came from i donâ€™t know where. so let us go and get killed
where we are told to go.

 is life worth the trouble of so many questions?
dâ€™artagnan, i am ready to follow you."

"and i also," said porthos.

"and i also," said aramis. "and, indeed, i am not sorry to quit paris; i
had need of distraction."

"well, you will have distractions enough, gentlemen, be assured," said
dâ€™artagnan.

"and, now, when are we to go?" asked athos.

"immediately," replied dâ€™artagnan; "we have not a minute to lose."

"hello, grimaud! planchet! mousqueton! bazin!" cried the four young men,
calling their lackeys, "clean my boots, and fetch the horses from the
hotel."

each musketeer was accustomed to leave at th

e general hotel, as at a
barrack, his own horse and that of his lackey. planchet, grimaud,
mousqueton, and bazin set off at full speed.

"now let us lay down the plan of campaign," said porthos. "where do we
go first?"

"to calais," said dâ€™artagnan; "that is the most direct line to london."

"well," said porthos, "this is my advice--"

"speak!"

"four men traveling together would be suspected. dâ€™artagnan will give
each of us his instructions. i will go by the way of boulogne to clear
the way; athos will set out two hours after, by that of amiens; aramis
will follow us by that of noyon; as to dâ€™artagnan, he will go by what
route he thinks is best, in planchetâ€™s clothes, while planchet will
follow us like dâ€™artagnan, in the uniform of the guards."

"gentlemen," said athos, "my opinion is that it

is not proper to allow
lackeys to have anything to do in such an affair. a secret may, by
chance, be betrayed by gentlemen; but it is almost always sold by
lackeys."

"porthosâ€™s plan appears to me to be impracticable," said dâ€™artagnan,
"inasmuch as i am myself ignorant of what instructions i can give you. i
am the bearer of a letter, that is all. i have not, and i cannot make

whereas four men together make a troop. we will arm our four lackeys
with pistols and musketoons; if they send an army out against us, we
will give battle, and the survivor, as dâ€™artagnan says, will carry the
letter."

"well said," cried aramis; "you donâ€™t often speak, athos, but when you
do speak, it is like st. john of the golden mouth. i agree to athosâ€™s
plan. and you, porthos?"

"i agree to it, too," said porthos, "if dâ€™artagnan approves of it.
dâ€™artagnan, being the bearer of the letter, is naturally the head of the
enterprise; let him decide, and we will execute."

"well," said dâ€™artagnan, "i decide that we should adopt athosâ€™s plan,
and that we set off in half an hour."

"agreed!" shouted the three musketeers in chorus.

pistoles, and made his preparations to set out at the time appointed.

they entered the common hall, and placed themselves at table. a
gentleman, who had just arrived by the route of dammartin, was seated at
the same table, and was breakfasting. he opened the conversation about
rain and fine weather; the travelers replied. he drank to their good
health, and the travelers returned his politeness.

but at the moment mousqueton came to announce that the horses were
ready, and they were arising from table, the stranger proposed to
porthos to drink the health of the cardinal. porthos replied that he
asked no better if the stranger, in his turn, would drink the health of
the king. the stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his
eminence. porthos called him drunk, and the stranger drew his sword.

"you have committed a piece of folly," said athos, "but it canâ€™t be
helped; there is no drawing back. kill the fellow, and rejoin us as soon
as you can."

all three remounted their horses, and set out at a good pace, while

porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the
thrusts known in the fencing schools.

"there goes one!" cried athos, at the end of five hundred paces.

"but why did that man attack porthos rather than any other one of us?"
asked aramis.

"because, as porthos was talking louder than the rest of us, he took him
for the chief," said dâ€™artagnan.

"i always said that this cadet from gascony was a well of wisdom,"
murmured athos; and the travelers continued their route.

at beauvais they stopped two hours, as well to breathe their horses a
little as to wait for porthos. at the end of two hours, as porthos did
not come, not any news of him, they resumed their journey.

at a league from beauvais, where the road was confined between two high
banks, they f

"it was an ambuscade!" shouted dâ€™artagnan. "donâ€™t waste a charge!
forward!"

aramis, wounded as he was, seized the mane of his horse, which carried
him on with the others. mousquetonâ€™s horse rejoined them, and galloped
by the side of his companions.

"that will serve us for a relay," said athos.

"i would rather have had a hat," said dâ€™artagnan. "mine was carried away
by a ball. by my faith, it is very fortunate that the letter was not in
it."

"theyâ€™ll kill poor porthos when he comes up," said aramis.

"if porthos were on his legs, he would have rejoined us by this time,"
said athos. "my opinion is that on the ground the drunken man was not
intoxicated."

they continued at their best speed for two hours, although the horses
were so fatigued that it was to be feared they would soon refuse
service.

the travelers had chosen crossroads in the hope that they might meet
with less interruption; but at crevecoeur, aramis declared he could
proceed no farther. in fact,

planchet, emboldened by the first exploit, sprang upon lubin; and being
strong and vigorous, he soon got him on the broad of his back, and
placed his knee upon his breast.

"go on with your affair, monsieur," cried planchet; "i have finished
mine."

seeing this, the gentleman drew his sword, and sprang upon dâ€™artagnan;
but he had too strong an adversary. in three seconds dâ€™artagnan had
wounded him three times, exclaiming at each thrust, "one for athos, one
for porthos; and one for aramis!"

at the third hit the gentleman fell like a log. dâ€™artagnan believed him
to be dead, or at least insensible, and went toward him for the purpose
of taking the order; but the moment he extended his hand to search for
it, the wounded man, who had not dropped his sword, plunged the point
into dâ€™artagnanâ€™s breast, crying, "one for you!"

"and one for me--the best for last!" cried dâ€™artagnan, furious, nailing
him to the earth with a fourth thrust through his body.

scriptures?"

dâ€™artagnan thought of the appointment mme. bonacieux had made with him
for that very evening; but we are bound to say, to the credit of our
hero, that the bad opinion entertained by m. de treville of women in
general, did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty
hostess.

"but, a propos," resumed m. de treville, "what has become of your three
companions?"

"i was about to ask you if you had heard any news of them?"

"none, monsieur."

"well, i left them on my road--porthos at chantilly, with a duel on his
hands; aramis at crevecoeur, with a ball in his shoulder; and athos at
amiens, detained by an accusation of coining."

"see there, now!" said m. de treville; "and how the devil did you
escape?"

"by a miracle, monsieur, i must acknowledge, with a sword thrust in my
breast, and by nailing the comte de wardes on the byroad to calais, like
a butterfly on a tapestry."

"there again! de wardes, one of the cardinalâ€™s men, a cousin of
rochefort! stop, my friend, i ha

pistoles. that, i think, is as much as i shall
want."

"but your companions?"

"i donâ€™t think they can be in need of any. we left paris, each with
seventy-five pistoles in his pocket."

"shall i see you again before your departure?"

"i think not, monsieur, unless something new should happen."

"well, a pleasant journey."

"thanks, monsieur."

dâ€™artagnan left m. de treville, touched more than ever by his paternal
solicitude for his musketeers.

he called successively at the abodes of athos, porthos, and aramis.
neither of them had returned. their lackeys likewise were absent, and
nothing had been heard of either the one or the other. he would have
inquired after them of their mistresses, but he was neither acquainted
with porthosâ€™s nor aramisâ€™s, and as to athos, he had none.

as he passed the hotel des gardes, he took a glance in to the stables.
three of the four horses had already arrived. planchet, all
astonishment, was busy grooming them, and had already finished two.

"ah, monsieu

and having found his diamond ring on his
finger, his purse in his pocket, and his pistols in his belt, he rose,
paid for his bottle, and went out to try if he could have any better
luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before.
the first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest
planchet, who, with the two horses in hand, awaited him at the door of a
little blind cabaret, before which dâ€™artagnan had passed without even a
suspicion of its existence.




25 porthos


instead of returning directly home, dâ€™artagnan alighted at the door of
m. de treville, and ran quickly up the stairs. this time he had decided
to relate all that had passed. m. de treville would doubtless give him
good advice as to the whole affair. besides, as m. de treville saw the
queen almost daily, he might be able to draw from her majesty some
intelligence of the poor young woman, whom they were doubtless making
pay very dearly for her devotedness to her mistress.

gentleman, i may be allowed to lie."

"be of good heart, planchet, you shall preserve your reputation as a
veracious man. in a quarter of an hour we set off."

"thatâ€™s the advice i was about to give monsieur; and where are we going,
may i ask, without being too curious?"

"pardieu! in the opposite direction to that which you said i was gone.
besides, are you not as anxious to learn news of grimaud, mousqueton,
and bazin as i am to know what has become of athos, porthos, and
aramis?"

"yes, monsieur," said planchet, "and i will go as soon as you please.
indeed, i think provincial air will suit us much better just now than
the air of paris. so then--"

"so then, pack up our luggage, planchet, and let us be off. on my part,
i will go out with my hands in my pockets, that nothing may be
suspected. you may join me at the hotel des gardes. by the way,
planchet, i think you are right with respect to our host, and that he is
decidedly a frightfully low wretch."

of planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young manâ€™s
road, our two travelers arrived at chantilly without any accident, and
alighted at the tavern of great st. martin, the same at which they had
stopped on their first journey.

the host, on seeing a young man followed by a lackey with two extra
horses, advanced respectfully to the door. now, as they had already
traveled eleven leagues, dâ€™artagnan thought it time to stop, whether
porthos were or were not in the inn. perhaps it would not be prudent to
ask at once what had become of the musketeer. the result of these
reflections was that dâ€™artagnan, without asking information of any kind,
alighted, commended the horses to the care of his lackey, entered a
small room destined to receive those who wished to be alone, and desired
the host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a breakfast
as possible--a desire which further corroborated the high opinion the

t, "that this is not the first time i have
had the honor of seeing monsieur."

"bah, i have passed perhaps ten times through chantilly, and out of the
ten times i have stopped three or four times at your house at least. why
i was here only ten or twelve days ago. i was conducting some friends,
musketeers, one of whom, by the by, had a dispute with a stranger--a man
who sought a quarrel with him, for i donâ€™t know what."

"exactly so," said the host; "i remember it perfectly. it is not
monsieur porthos that your lordship means?"

"yes, that is my companionâ€™s name. my god, my dear host, tell me if
anything has happened to him?"

"your lordship must have observed that he could not continue his
journey."

"why, to be sure, he promised to rejoin us, and we have seen nothing of
him."

"he has done us the honor to remain here."

"what, he had done you the honor to remain here?"

"yes, monsieur, in this house; and we are even a little uneasy--"

"on what account?"

"of certain expenses he has cont

racted."

"well, but whatever expenses he may have incurred, i am sure he is in a
condition to pay them."

"ah, monsieur, you infuse genuine balm into my blood. we have made
considerable advances; and this very morning the surgeon declared that
if monsieur porthos did not pay him, he should look to me, as it was i
who had sent for him."

"porthos is wounded, then?"

"i cannot tell you, monsieur."

"what! you cannot tell me? surely you ought to be able to tell me better
than any other person."

"yes; but in our situation we must not say all we know--particularly as
we have been warned that our ears should answer for our tongues."

"well, can i see porthos?"

"certainly, monsieur. take the stairs on your right; go up the first
flight and knock at number one. only warn him that it is you."

"why should i do that?"

"because, monsieur, some
 
 ___________________________
 
 mischief might happen to you."

"of what kind, in the name of wonder?"

"monsieur porthos may imagine you belong to the house, and in a fit of
passion might run his sword through you or blow out your brains."

"what have you done to him, then?"

"we have asked him for money."

"the devil! ah, i can understand that. it is a demand that porthos takes
very ill when he is not in funds; but i know he must be so at present."

"we thought so, too, monsieur. as our house is carried on very
regularly, and we make out our bills every week, at the end of eight
days we presented our account; but it appeared we had chosen an unlucky
moment, for at the first word on the subject, he sent us to all the
devils. it is true he had been playing the day before."

"playing the day before! and with whom?"

"lord, who can say, monsieur? with some gentleman

 who was traveling this
way, to whom he proposed a game of lansquenet."

"thatâ€™s it, then, and the foolish fellow lost all he had?"

"even to his horse, monsieur; for when the gentleman was about to set
out, we perceived that his lackey was saddling monsieur porthosâ€™s horse,
as well as his masterâ€™s. when we observed this to him, he told us all to
trouble ourselves about our own business, as this horse belonged to him.
we also informed monsieur porthos of what was going on; but he told us
we were scoundrels to doubt a gentlemanâ€™s word, and that as he had said
the horse was his, it must be so."

"thatâ€™s porthos all over," murmured dâ€™artagnan.

"then," continued the host, "i replied that as from the moment we seemed
not likely to come to a good understanding with respect to payment, i
hoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the favor of his
custom to my brother host of the golden eagle; but monsieur porthos
replied that, m

y house being the best, he should remain where he was.
this reply was too flattering to allow me to insist on his departure. i
confined myself then to begging him to give up his chamber, which is the
handsomest in the hotel, and to be satisfied with a pretty little room
on the third floor; but to this monsieur porthos replied that as he
every moment expected his mistress, who was one of the greatest ladies
in the court, i might easily comprehend that the chamber he did me the
honor to occupy in my house was itself very mean for the visit of such a
personage. nevertheless, while acknowledging the truth of what he said,
i thought proper to insist; but without even giving himself the trouble
to enter into any discussion with me, he took one of his pistols, laid
it on his table, day and night, and said that at t

imble than his master; so that for the sake of his master, he puts us
all under his feet, and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for,
he takes all he wants without asking at all."

"the fact is," said dâ€™artagnan, "i have always observed a great degree
of intelligence and devotedness in mousqueton."

"that is possible, monsieur; but suppose i should happen to be brought
in contact, even four times a year, with such intelligence and
devotedness--why, i should be a ruined man!"

"no, for porthos will pay you."

"hum!" said the host, in a doubtful tone.

"the favorite of a great lady will not be allowed to be inconvenienced
for such a paltry sum as he owes you."

"if i durst say what i believe on that head--"

"what you believe?"

"i ought rather to say, what i know."

"what you know?"

"and even what i am sure of."

"and of what are you so sure?"

"i would say that i know this great lady."

"you?"

"yes; i."

"and how do you know her?"

"oh, monsieur, if i could believe i might trust i

n your discretion."

"speak! by the word of a gentleman, you shall have no cause to repent of
your confidence."

"well, monsieur, you understand that uneasiness makes us do many
things."

"what have you done?"

"oh, nothing which was not right in the character of a creditor."

"well?"

"monsieur porthos gave us a note for his duchess, ordering us to put it
in the post. this was before his servant came. as he could not leave his
chamber, it was necessary to charge us with this commission."

"and then?"

"instead of putting the letter in the post, which is never safe, i took
advantage of the journey of one of my lads to paris, and ordered him to
convey the letter to this duchess himself. this was fulfilling the
intentions of monsieur porthos, who had desired us to be so careful of
this letter, w

as it not?"

"nearly so."

"well, monsieur, do you know who this great lady is?"

"no; i have heard porthos speak of her, thatâ€™s all."

"do you know who this pretended duchess is?

"i repeat to you, i donâ€™t know her."

"why, she is the old wife of a procurator* of the chatelet, monsieur,
named madame coquenard, who, although she is at least fifty, still gives
herself jealous airs. it struck me as very odd that a princess should
live in the rue aux ours."

_*attorney_

"but how do you know all this?"

"because she flew into a great passion on receiving the letter, saying
that monsieur porthos was

a weathercock, and that she was sure it was
for some woman he had received this wound."

"has he been wounded, then?"

"oh, good lord! what have i said?"

"you said that porthos had received a sword cut."

"yes, but he has forbidden me so strictly to say so."

"and why so."

"zounds, monsieur! because he had boasted that he would perforate the
stranger with whom you left him in dispute; whereas the stranger, on the
contrary, in spite of all his rodomontades quickly threw him on his
back. as monsieur porthos is a very boastful man, he insists that nobody
shall know he has received this wound except the duchess, whom he
endeavored to interest by an account of his adventu

re."

"it is a wound that confines him to his bed?"

"ah, and a master stroke, too, i assure you. your friendâ€™s soul must
stick tight to his body."

"were you there, then?"

"monsieur, i followed them from curiosity, so that i saw the combat
without the combatants seeing me."

"and what took place?"

"oh! the affair was not long, i assure you. they placed themselves on
guard; the stranger made a feint and a lunge, and that so rapidly that
when monsieur porthos came to the parade, he had already three inches of
steel in his breast. he immediately fell backward. the stranger placed
the point of his sword at his throat; and monsieur porthos, finding
himself at the mercy of his adversary, acknowledged himself conquered.
upon which the stranger asked his name, and learning that it was
porthos, and not dâ€™artagnan, he assisted him to rise, brought him back
to the hotel, mounted his horse, and disappeared."

"so it was with monsieur dâ€™artagnan this stran
 
 ___________________________
 
ger meant to quarrel?"

"it appears so."

"and do you know what has become of him?"

"no, i never saw him until that moment, and have not seen him since."

"very well; i know all that i wish to know. porthosâ€™s chamber is, you
say, on the first story, number one?"

"yes, monsieur, the handsomest in the inn--a chamber that i could have
let ten times over."

"bah! be satisfied," said dâ€™artagnan, laughing, "porthos will pay you
with the money of the duchess coquenard."

"oh, monsieur, procuratorâ€™s wife or duchess, if she will but loosen her
pursestrings, it will be all the same; but she positively answered that
she was tired of the exigencies and infidelities of monsieur porthos,
and that she would not send him a denier."

"and did you convey this answer to your guest?"

"we took good care not to do that; he would have found in what fashion
we had executed his commission."

"so that he still expects his
 
 ___________________________
 
 money?"

"oh, lord, yes, monsieur! yesterday he wrote again; but it was his
servant who this time put the letter in the post."

"do you say the procuratorâ€™s wife is old and ugly?"

"fifty at least, monsieur, and not at all handsome, according to
pathaudâ€™s account."

"in that case, you may be quite at ease; she will soon be softened.
besides, porthos cannot owe you much."

"how, not much! twenty good pistoles, already, without reckoning the
doctor. he denies himself nothing; it may easily be seen he has been
accustomed to live well."

"never mind; if his mistress abandons him, he will find friends, i will
answer for it. so, my dear host, be not uneasy, and continue to take all
the care of him that his situation requires."

"monsieur has promised me not to open his mouth about the procuratorâ€™s
wife, and not to say a word of the wound?"

"t
 
 ___________________________
 
e would kill me!"

"donâ€™t be afraid; he is not so much of a devil as he appears."

saying these words, dâ€™artagnan went upstairs, leaving his host a little
better satisfied with respect to two things in which he appeared to be
very much interested--his debt and his life.

at the top of the stairs, upon the most conspicuous door of the
corridor, was traced in black ink a gigantic number "1." dâ€™artagnan
knocked, and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside, he
entered the chamber.

porthos was in bed, and was playing a game at lansquenet with
mousqueton, to keep his hand in; while a spit loaded with partridges was
turning before the fire, and on each side of a large chimneypiece, over
two chafing dishes, were boiling two stewpans, from which exhaled a
double odor of rabbit and fish stews, rejoicing to the smell. in
addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble
of a commode were covered with empty bottles.

at the sight of his friend, porthos uttered a lo
 
 ___________________________
 
ud cry of joy; and
mousqueton, rising respectfully, yielded his place to him, and went to
give an eye to the two stewpans, of which he appeared to have the
particular inspection.

"ah, pardieu! is that you?" said porthos to dâ€™artagnan. "you are right
welcome. excuse my not coming to meet you; but," added he, looking at
dâ€™artagnan with a certain degree of uneasiness, "you know what has
happened to me?"

"no."

"has the host told you nothing, then?"

"i asked after you, and came up as soon as i could."

porthos seemed to breathe more freely.

"and what has happened to you, my dear porthos?" continued dâ€™artagnan.

"why, on making a thrust at my adversary, whom i had already hit three
times, and whom i meant 
 
 ___________________________
 
to finish with the fourth, i put my foot on a
stone, slipped, and strained my knee."

"truly?"

"honor! luckily for the rascal, for i should have left him dead on the
spot, i assure you."

"and what has became of him?"

"oh, i donâ€™t know; he had enough, and set off without waiting for the
rest. but you, my dear dâ€™artagnan, what has happened to you?"

"so that this strain of the knee," continued dâ€™artagnan, "my dear
porthos, keeps you in bed?"

"my god, thatâ€™s all. i shall be about again in a few days."

"why did you not have yourself conveyed to paris? you must be cruelly
bored here."

"that was my intention; but, my dear friend, i have one thing to confess
to you."

"whatâ€™s that?"

"it is that as i was cruelly bored, as you say, and as i had the
seventy-five pistoles in my pocket which you had distributed to me, in
order to amuse myself i invited a gentleman who was traveling this way
to walk up, and propose

d a cast of dice. he accepted my challenge, and,
my faith, my seventy-five pistoles passed from my pocket to his, without
reckoning my horse, which he won into the bargain. but you, my dear
dâ€™artagnan?"

"what can you expect, my dear porthos; a man is not privileged in all
ways," said dâ€™artagnan. "you know the proverb â€™unlucky at play, lucky in
love.â€™ you are too fortunate in your love for play not to take its
revenge. what consequence can the reverses of fortune be to you? have
you not, happy rogue that you are--have you not your duchess, who cannot
fail to come to your aid?"

"well, you see, my dear dâ€™artagnan, with what ill luck i play," replied
porthos, with the most careless air in the world. "i wrote to her to
send me
 
 ___________________________
 
 fifty louis or so, of which i stood absolutely in need on
account of my accident."

"well?"

"well, she must be at her country seat, for she has not answered me."

"truly?"

"no; so i yesterday addressed another epistle to her, still more
pressing than the first. but you are here, my dear fellow, let us speak
of you. i confess i began to be very uneasy on your account."

"but your host behaves very well toward you, as it appears, my dear
porthos," said dâ€™artagnan, directing the sick manâ€™s attention to the
full stewpans and the empty bottles.

"so, so," replied porthos. "only three or four days ago the impertinent
jackanapes gave me his bill, and i was forced to turn both him and his
bill out of the door; so that i am here something in the fashion of a
conqueror, holding my position, as it were, my conquest. so you see,
being in constant fear of being forced from that position, i am armed to
the teeth."

"and yet," said dâ€™artagnan
 
 ___________________________
 
, laughing, "it appears to me that from time
to time you must make sorties." and he again pointed to the bottles and
the stewpans.

"not i, unfortunately!" said porthos. "this miserable strain confines me
to my bed; but mousqueton forages, and brings in provisions. friend
mousqueton, you see that we have a reinforcement, and we must have an
increase of supplies."

"mousqueton," said dâ€™artagnan, "you must render me a service."

"what, monsieur?"

"you must give your recipe to planchet. i may be besieged in my turn,
and i shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same
advantages with which you gratify your master."

"lord, monsieur! there is no

the key of which never leaves him; only this cellar has a ventilating
hole. now through this ventilating hole i throw my lasso, and as i now
know in which part of the cellar is the best wine, thatâ€™s my point for
sport. you see, monsieur, what the new world has to do with the bottles
which are on the commode and the wardrobe. now, will you taste our wine,
and without prejudice say what you think of it?"

"thank you, my friend, thank you; unfortunately, i have just
breakfasted."

"well," said porthos, "arrange the table, mousqueton, and while we
breakfast, dâ€™artagnan will relate to us what has happened to him during
the ten days since he left us."

"willingly," said dâ€™artagnan.

while porthos and mousqueton were breakfasting, with the appetites of
convalescents and with that brotherly cordiality which unites men in
misfortune, dâ€™artagnan related how aramis, being wounded, was obliged to
stop at crevecoeur, how he had left athos fighting at amiens with four
men who accused him of being
 
 ___________________________
 
 a coiner, and how he, dâ€™artagnan, had been
forced to run the comtes de wardes through the body in order to reach
england.

but there the confidence of dâ€™artagnan stopped. he only added that on
his return from great britain he had brought back four magnificent
horses--one for himself, and one for each of his companions; then he
informed porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in
the stable of the tavern.

at this moment planchet entered, to inform his master that the horses
were sufficiently refreshed and that it would be possible to sleep at
clermont.

as dâ€™artagnan was tolerably reassured with regard to porthos, and as he
was anxious to obtain news of his two other friends, he held out his
hand to the wounded man, and told him he was about to resume his route
in order to continue his researches. for the rest, a

s he reckoned upon
returning by the same route in seven or eight days, if porthos were
still at the great st. martin, he would call for him on his way.

porthos replied that in all probability his sprain would not permit him
to depart yet awhile. besides, it was necessary he should stay at
chantilly to wait for the answer from his duchess.

dâ€™artagnan wished that answer might be prompt and favorable; and having
again recommended porthos to the care of mousqueton, and paid his bill
to the host, he resumed his route with planchet, already relieved of one
of his led horses.




26 aramis and his thesis


dâ€™artagnan had said nothing to porthos of his wound or of his
procuratorâ€™s wife. our bearnais was a prudent lad, however young he
might be. consequently he had appeared to believe all that the
vainglorious musketeer had told him, convinced that no friendship will
hold out against a surprised secret. besides, we feel always a

"now," continued aramis, "as the ladies did not see the singer come
back, and as he was found in the rue payenne with a great sword wound
through his body, it was supposed that i had accommodated him thus; and
the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the cassock
for a time. athos, whose acquaintance i made about that period, and
porthos, who had in addition to my lessons taught me some effective
tricks of fence, prevailed upon me to solicit the uniform of a
musketeer. the king entertained great regard for my father, who had
fallen at the siege of arras, and the uniform was granted. you may
understand that the moment has come for me to re-enter the bosom of the
church."

"and why today, rather than yesterday or tomorrow? what has happened to
you today, to raise all these melancholy ideas?"

"this wound, my dear dâ€™artagnan, ha

 bravery
which might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of the
rarest coolness--such qualities attracted more than the esteem, more
than the friendship of dâ€™artagnan; they attracted his admiration.

indeed, when placed beside m. de treville, the elegant and noble
courtier, athos in his most cheerful days might advantageously sustain a
comparison. he was of middle height; but his person was so admirably
shaped and so well proportioned that more than once in his struggles
with porthos he had overcome the giant whose physical strength was
proverbial among the musketeers. his head, with piercing eyes, a
straight nose, a chin cut like that of brutus, had altogether an
indefinable character of grandeur and grace. his hands, of which he took
little care, were the despair of aramis, who cultivated his with almond
paste and perfumed oil. the sound of his voice was at once penetrating
and melodious; and then, that which was inconceivable in athos, who was
always retiring, was that d

land owners. he was profoundly versed in hunting and
falconry, and had one day when conversing on this great art astonished
even louis xiii himself, who took a pride in being considered a past
master therein.

like all the great nobles of that period, athos rode and fenced to
perfection. but still further, his education had been so little
neglected, even with respect to scholastic studies, so rare at this time
among gentlemen, that he smiled at the scraps of latin which aramis
sported and which porthos pretended to understand. two or three times,
even, to the great astonishment of his friends, he had, when aramis
allowed some rudimental error to escape him, replaced a verb in its
right tense and a noun in its case. besides, his probity was
irreproachable, in an age in which soldiers compromised so easily with
their religion and their consciences, lovers with the rigorous delicacy
of our era, and the poor with godâ€™s seventh commandment. this athos,
then, was a very extraordinary man.

subject--been able to assign any cause for these fits, or for the

never had concerns which all his friends did not know.

it could not be said that it was wine which produced this sadness; for
in truth he only drank to combat this sadness, which wine however, as we
have said, rendered still darker. this excess of bilious humor could not
be attributed to play; for unlike porthos, who accompanied the
variations of chance with songs or oaths, athos when he won remained as
unmoved as when he lost. he had been known, in the circle of the
musketeers, to win in one night three thousand pistoles; to lose them
even to the gold-embroidered belt for gala days, win all this again with
the addition of a hundred louis, without his beautiful eyebrow being
heightened or lowered half a line, without his hands losing their pearly
hue, without his conversation, which was cheerful that e

"why, this man is a cask!" said the host, aside. "if he only remains
here a fortnight, and pays for what he drinks, i shall soon re-establish
my business."

"and donâ€™t forget," said dâ€™artagnan, "to bring up four bottles of the
same sort for the two english gentlemen."

"and now," said athos, "while they bring the wine, tell me, dâ€™artagnan,
what has become of the others, come!"

dâ€™artagnan related how he had found porthos in bed with a strained knee,
and aramis at a table between two theologians. as he finished, the host
entered with the wine ordered and a ham which, fortunately for him, had
been left out of the cellar.

"thatâ€™s well!" said athos, filling his glass and that of his friend;
"hereâ€™s to porthos and aramis! but you, dâ€™artagnan, what is the matter
with you, and what has happened to you personally? you have a sad air."

"alas," said dâ€™artagnan, "it is because i am the most unfortunate."

"tell

"and there again you are wrong. a horse slips and injures a joint; a
horse stumbles and breaks his knees to the bone; a horse eats out of a
manger in which a glandered horse has eaten. there is a horse, while on
the contrary, the hundred pistoles feed their master."

"but how shall we get back?"

"upon our lackeyâ€™s horses, pardieu. anybody may see by our bearing that
we are people of condition."

"pretty figures we shall cut on ponies while aramis and porthos caracole
on their steeds."

"aramis! porthos!" cried athos, and laughed aloud.

"what is it?" asked dâ€™artagnan, who did not at all comprehend the
hilarity of his friend.

"nothing, nothing! go on!"

"your advice, then?"

"to take the hundred pistoles, dâ€™artagnan. with the hundred pistoles we
can live well to the end of the month. we have undergone a great deal of
fatigue, remember, and a little rest will do no harm."

"i rest? oh, no, athos. once in paris, i shall prosecute my search for

"my faith, my dear aramis," said dâ€™artagnan, who detested verses almost
as much as he did latin, "add to the merit of the difficulty that of the
brevity, and you are sure that your poem will at least have two merits."

"you will see," continued aramis, "that it breathes irreproachable
passion. and so, my friends, we return to paris? bravo! i am ready. we
are going to rejoin that good fellow, porthos. so much the better. you
canâ€™t think how i have missed him, the great simpleton. to see him so
self-satisfied reconciles me with myself. he would not sell his horse;
not for a kingdom! i think i can see him now, mounted upon his superb
animal and seated in his handsome saddle. i am sure he will look like
the great mogul!"

they made a halt for an hour to refresh their horses. aramis discharged
his bill, placed bazin in the cart with his comrades, and they set
forward to join porthos.

first visit, and seated at a table on which, though he was alone, was
spread enough for four persons. this dinner consisted of meats nicely
dressed, choice wines, and superb fruit.

"ah, pardieu!" said he, rising, "you come in the nick of time,
gentlemen. i was just beginning the soup, and you will dine with me."

"oh, oh!" said dâ€™artagnan, "mousqueton has not caught these bottles with
his lasso. besides, here is a piquant fricandeau and a fillet of beef."

"i am recruiting myself," said porthos, "i am recruiting myself. nothing
weakens a man more than these devilish strains. did you ever suffer from
a strain, athos?"

"never! though i remember, in our affair of the rue ferou, i received a
sword wound which at the end of fifteen or eighteen days produced the
same effect."

"but this dinner was not intended for you alone, porthos?" said aramis.

"no," said porthos, "i expected some gentlemen of the neighborhood, who
have just sent me word they could not come. you will take their places

and i shall not lose by the exchange. hola, mousqueton, seats, and order

"do you know what we are eating here?" said athos, at the end of ten
minutes.

"pardieu!" replied dâ€™artagnan, "for my part, i am eating veal garnished
with shrimps and vegetables."

"and i some lamb chops," said porthos.

"and i a plain chicken," said aramis.

"you are all mistaken, gentlemen," answered athos, gravely; "you are
eating horse."

"eating what?" said dâ€™artagnan.

"horse!" said aramis, with a grimace of disgust.

porthos alone made no reply.

"yes, horse. are we not eating a horse, porthos? and perhaps his saddle,
therewith."

"no, gentlemen, i have kept the harness," said porthos.

"my faith," said aramis, "we are all alike. one would think we had
tipped the wink."

"what could i do?" said porth

os. "this horse made my visitors ashamed of
theirs, and i donâ€™t like to humiliate people."

"then your duchess is still at the waters?" asked dâ€™artagnan.

"still," replied porthos. "and, my faith, the governor of the
province--one of the gentlemen i expected today--seemed to have such a
wish for him, that i gave him to him."

"gave him?" cried dâ€™artagnan.

"my god, yes, gave, that is the word," said porthos; "for the animal was
worth at least a hundred and fifty louis, and the stingy fellow would
only give me eighty."

"without the saddle?" said aramis.

"yes, without the saddle."

"you will observe, gentlemen," said athos, "that porthos has made the
best bargain of any of us."

and then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined, to the
astonishment of poor porthos; but when he was informed of the cause of
their hilarity, he shared it vociferously according to his custom.

"there is on

ramisâ€™s spanish wine so good
that i sent on a hamper of sixty bottles of it in the wagon with the
lackeys. that has weakened my purse."

"and i," said aramis, "imagined that i had given almost my last sou to
the church of montdidier and the jesuits of amiens, with whom i had made
engagements which i ought to have kept. i have ordered masses for
myself, and for you, gentlemen, which will be said, gentlemen, for which
i have not the least doubt you will be marvelously benefited."

"and i," said porthos, "do you think my strain cost me nothing?--without
reckoning mousquetonâ€™s wound, for which i had to have the surgeon twice
a day, and who charged me double on account of that foolish mousqueton
having allowed himself a ball in a part which people generally only show
to an apothecary; so i advised him to try never to get wounded there any
more."

"ay, ay!" said athos, exchanging a smile with dâ€™artagnan and aramis, "it
is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad; that is like
a

good master."

"in short," said porthos, "when all my expenses are paid, i shall have,
at most, thirty crowns left."

"and i about ten pistoles," said aramis.

"well, then it appears that we are the croesuses of the society. how
much have you left of your hundred pistoles, dâ€™artagnan?"

"of my hundred pistoles? why, in the first place i gave you fifty."

"you think so?"

"pardieu!" "ah, that is true. i recollect."

"then i paid the host six."

"what a brute of a host! why did you give him six pistoles?"

"you told me to give them t

o him."

"it is true; i am too good-natured. in brief, how much remains?"

"twenty-five pistoles," said dâ€™artagnan.

"and i," said athos, taking some small change from his pocket, "i--"

"you? nothing!"

"my faith! so little that it is not worth reckoning with the general
stock."

"now, then, let us calculate how much we posses in all."

"porthos?"

"thirty crowns."

"aramis?"

"ten pistoles."

"and you, dâ€™artagnan?"

"twenty-five."

"that makes in all?" said athos.

"four hundred and seventy-five livres," said dâ€™artagnan, who reckoned
like archimedes.

"on our arrival in paris, we shall still have four hundred, besides the
harnesses," said porthos.

"but our troop horses?" said aramis.

"well, of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the
masters, for which we will draw lots. with the four hundred livres we
will make t

give the turnings out of our pockets to dâ€™artagnan, who has a steady
hand, and will go and play in the first gaming house we come to. there!"

"let us dine, then," said porthos; "it is getting cold."

the friends, at ease with regard to the future, did honor to the repast,
the remains of which were abandoned to mousqueton, bazin, planchet, and
grimaud.

on arriving in paris, dâ€™artagnan found a letter from m. de treville,
which informed him that, at his request, the king had promised that he
should enter the company of the musketeers.

as this was the height of dâ€™artagnanâ€™s worldly ambition--apart, be it
well understood, from his desire of finding mme. bonacieux-

in a state of bewilderment.
m. de treville never jested in matters relating to discipline.

"and what do you reckon your outfit will cost?" said dâ€™artagnan.

"oh, we can scarcely say. we have made our calculations with spartan
economy, and we each require fifteen hundred livres."

"four times fifteen makes sixty--six thousand livres," said athos.

"it seems to me," said dâ€™artagnan, "with a thousand livres each--i do
not speak as a spartan, but as a procurator--"

this word procurator roused porthos. "stop," said he, "i have an idea."

"well, thatâ€™s something, for i have not the shadow of one," said athos
coolly; "but as to dâ€™artagnan, gentlemen, the idea of belonging to ours
has driven him out of his senses. a thousand livres! for my part, i
declare i want two thousand."

"four times two makes eight," then said aramis; "it is eight thousand
that we want to complete our outfits, toward which, it is true, we have
already the saddles."

"besides," said athos, waiting till dâ€™artagnan, w

29 hunting for the equipments


the most preoccupied of the four friends was certainly dâ€™artagnan,
although he, in his quality of guardsman, would be much more easily
equipped than messieurs the musketeers, who were all of high rank; but
our gascon cadet was, as may have been observed, of a provident and
almost avaricious character, and with that (explain the contradiction)
so vain as almost to rival porthos. to this preoccupation of his vanity,
dâ€™artagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish.
notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting mme. bonacieux, he could
obtain no intelligence of her. m. de treville had spoken of her to the
queen. the queen was ignorant where the mercerâ€™s young wife was, but had
promised to have her sought for; but this promise was very vague and did
not at all reassure dâ€™artagnan.

athos did not leave his chamber; he made up his mind not to take a
si

o his friends, "well,
if at the end of a fortnight i have found nothing, or rather if nothing
has come to find me, as i, too good a catholic to kill myself with a
pistol bullet, i will seek a good quarrel with four of his eminenceâ€™s
guards or with eight englishmen, and i will fight until one of them has
killed me, which, considering the number, cannot fail to happen. it will
then be said of me that i died for the king; so that i shall have
performed my duty without the expense of an outfit."

porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him, tossing his
head and repeating, "i shall follow up on my idea."

aramis, anxious and negligently dressed, said nothing.

it may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in
the community.

the lackeys on their part, like the coursers of hippolytus, shared the
sadness of their masters. mousqueton collected a store of crusts; bazin,
who had always been inclined to devotion, never quit the churches;
planchet watched the flight of

e stones.

the three friends--for, as we have said, athos had sworn not to stir a
foot to equip himself--went out early in the morning, and returned late
at night. they wandered about the streets, looking at the pavement as if
to see whether the passengers had not left a purse behind them. they
might have been supposed to be following tracks, so observant were they
wherever they went. when they met they looked desolately at one another,
as much as to say, "have you found anything?"

however, as porthos had first found an idea, and had thought of it
earnestly afterward, he was the first to act. he was a man of execution,
this worthy porthos. dâ€™artagnan perceived him one day walking toward the
church of st. leu, and followed him instinctively. he entered, after
having twisted his mustache and elongated his imperial, which always
announced on his part the most triumphant resolutions. as dâ€™artagnan
took some precautions to conceal himself, porthos believed he had not
been seen. dâ€™artagnan e

ntered behind him. porthos went and leaned
against the side of a pillar. dâ€™artagnan, still unperceived, supported
himself against the other side.

there happened to be a sermon, which made the church very full of
people. porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the women.
thanks to the cares of mousqueton, the exterior was far from announcing
the distress of the interior. his hat was a little napless, his feather
was a little faded, his gold lace was a little tarnished, his laces were
a trifle frayed; but in the obscurity of the church these things were
not seen, and porthos was still the handsome porthos.

dâ€™artagnan observed, on the bench nearest to the pillar against which
porthos leaned, a sort of ripe
 
 ___________________________
 
 beauty, rather yellow and rather dry, but
erect and haughty under her black hood. the eyes of porthos were
furtively cast upon this lady, and then roved about at large over the
nave.

on her side the lady, who from time to time blushed, darted with the
rapidity of lightning a glance toward the inconstant porthos; and then
immediately the eyes of porthos wandered anxiously. it was plain that
this mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood, for she bit
her lips till they bled, scratched the end of her nose, and could not
sit still in her seat.

porthos, seeing this, retwisted his mustache, elongated his imperial a
second time, and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near
the choir, and who not only was a beautiful lady, but still further, no
doubt, a great lady--for she had behind her a negro boy who had brought
the cushi

on on which she knelt, and a female servant who held the
emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the
mass.

the lady with the black hood followed through all their wanderings the
looks of porthos, and perceived that they rested upon the lady with the
velvet cushion, the little negro, and the maid-servant.

during this time porthos played close. it was almost imperceptible
motions of his eyes, fingers placed upon the lips, little assassinating
smiles, which really did assassinate the disdained beauty.

then she cried, "ahem!" under cover of the mea culpa, striking her
breast so vigorously that everybody, even the lady with the red cushion,
turned round toward her. porthos paid no attention. nevertheless, he
understood it all, but was deaf.

the lady with the red cushion produced a great effect--for she was very
handsome--
 
 ___________________________
 
upon the lady with the black hood, who saw in her a rival
really to be dreaded; a great effect upon porthos, who thought her much
prettier than the lady with the black hood; a great effect upon
dâ€™artagnan, who recognized in her the lady of meung, of calais, and of
dover, whom his persecutor, the man with the scar, had saluted by the
name of milady.

dâ€™artagnan, without losing sight of the lady of the red cushion,
continued to watch the proceedings of porthos, which amused him greatly.
he guessed that the lady of the black hood was the procuratorâ€™s wife of
the rue aux ours, which was the more probable from the church of st. leu
being not far from that locality.

he guessed, likewise, by induction, that porthos was taking his revenge
for the defeat of chantilly, when the procuratorâ€™s wife had proved so
refractory with respect to her purse.

amid all this, dâ€™artagnan remarked also that not one countenance
responded to the gallantries of porthos.

 there were only chimeras and
illusions; but for real love, for true jealousy, is there any reality
except illusions and chimeras?

the sermon over, the procuratorâ€™s wife advanced toward the holy font.
porthos went before her, and instead of a finger, dipped his whole hand
in. the procuratorâ€™s wife smiled, thinking that it was for her porthos
had put himself to this trouble; but she was cruelly and promptly
undeceived. when she was only about three steps from him, he turned his
head round, fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red
cushion, who had risen and was approaching, followed by her black boy
and her woman.

when the lady of the red cushion came close to porthos, porthos drew his
dripping hand from the font. the fair worshipper touched the great hand
of porthos with her delicate fingers, smiled, made the sign of

the
cross, and left the church.

this was too much for the procuratorâ€™s wife; she doubted not there was
an intrigue between this lady and porthos. if she had been a great lady
she would have fainted; but as she was only a procuratorâ€™s wife, she
contented herself saying to the musketeer with concentrated fury, "eh,
monsieur porthos, you donâ€™t offer me any holy water?"

porthos, at the sound of that voice, started like a man awakened from a
sleep of a hundred years.

"ma-madame!" cried he; "is that you? how is your husband, our dear
monsieur coquenard? is he still as stingy as ever? where can my eyes
have been not to have seen you during the two hours of the sermon?"

"i was within two paces of you, monsieur," replied the procuratorâ€™s
wife; "but you did not perceive me because you had no eyes but for the
pretty lady to whom you just now gave the holy water."

portho

s pretended to be confused. "ah," said he, "you have remarked--"

"i must have been blind not to have seen."

"yes," said porthos, "that is a duchess of my acquaintance whom i have
great trouble to meet on account of the jealousy of her husband, and who
sent me word that she should come today to this poor church, buried in
this vile quarter, solely for the sake of seeing me."

"monsieur porthos," said the procuratorâ€™s wife, "will you have the
kindness to offer me your arm for five minutes? i have something to say
to you."

"certainly, madame," said porthos, winking to himself, as a gambler does
who laughs at the dupe he is about to pluck.

at that moment dâ€™artagnan passed in pursuit of milady; he cast a passing
glance at porthos, and beheld this triumphant look.

"eh, eh!" said he, reasoning to himself according to the strangely easy
morality of that gallant period, "there is one 
 
 ___________________________
 
who will be equipped in
good time!"

porthos, yielding to the pressure of the arm of the procuratorâ€™s wife,
as a bark yields to the rudder, arrived at the cloister st. magloire--a
little-frequented passage, enclosed with a turnstile at each end. in the
daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their crusts, and
children at play.

"ah, monsieur porthos," cried the procuratorâ€™s wife, when she was
assured that no one who was a stranger to the population of the locality
could either see or hear her, "ah, monsieur porthos, you are a great
conqueror, as it appears!"

"i, madame?" said porthos, drawing himself up proudly; "how so?"

"the signs just now, and the holy water! but that must be a princess, at
least--that lady with her negro boy and her maid!"

"my god! madame, you are deceived," said porthos; "she is simply a
duchess."

"and that runn

ing footman who waited at the door, and that carriage with
a coachman in grand livery who sat waiting on his seat?"

porthos had seen neither the footman nor the carriage, but with the eye
of a jealous woman, mme. coquenard had seen everything.

porthos regretted that he had not at once made the lady of the red
cushion a princess.

"ah, you are quite the pet of the ladies, monsieur porthos!" resumed the
procuratorâ€™s wife, with a sigh.

"well," responded porthos, "you may imagine, with the physique with
which nature has endowed me, i am not in want of good luck."

"good lord, how quickly men forget!" cried the procuratorâ€™s wife,
raising her eyes toward heaven.

"less quickly than the women, it seems to me," replied porthos; "for i,
madame, i may say i was your victim, when wounded, dying, i was
abandoned by the surgeons. i, the offspring of a noble family, who
placed reliance upon your friendship--i was near dying of my wounds at
first, and of hunger

 afterward, in a beggarly inn at chantilly, without
you ever deigning once to reply to the burning letters i addressed to
you."

"but, monsieur porthos," murmured the procuratorâ€™s wife, who began to
feel that, to judge by the conduct of the great ladies of the time, she
was wrong.

"i, who had sacrificed for you the baronne de--"

"i know it well."

"the comtesse de--"

"monsieur porthos, be generous!"

"you are right, madame, and i will not finish."

"but it was my husband who would not hear of lending."

"madame coquenard," said porthos, "remember the first letter you wrote
me, and which i preserve engraved in my memory."

the procuratorâ€™s wife uttered a groan.

"besides," said she, "the sum you required me to borrow was rather
large."

"madame coquenard, i gave you the preference. i had but to write to the
duchesse--but i wonâ€™t repeat her name, for i am incapable of
comp

romising a woman; but this i know, that i had but to write to her
and she would have sent me fifteen hundred."

the procuratorâ€™s wife shed a tear.

"monsieur porthos," said she, "i can assure you that you have severely
punished me; and if in the time to come you should find yourself in a
similar situation, you have but to apply to me."

"fie, madame, fie!" said porthos, as if disgusted. "let us not talk
about money, if you please; it is humiliating."

"then you no longer love me!" said the procuratorâ€™s wife, slowly and
sadly.

porthos maintained a majestic silence.

"and that is the only reply you make? alas, i understand."

"think of the offense you have committed toward me, madame! it remains
here!" said porthos, placing his hand on his heart, and pressing it
strongly.

"i will repair it, indeed i will, my dear porthos."

"besides, what did i ask of you?"
 
 ___________________________
 
 resumed porthos, with a movement of
the shoulders full of good fellowship. "a loan, nothing more! after all,
i am not an unreasonable man. i know you are not rich, madame coquenard,
and that your husband is obliged to bleed his poor clients to squeeze a
few paltry crowns from them. oh! if you were a duchess, a marchioness,
or a countess, it would be quite a different thing; it would be
unpardonable."

the procuratorâ€™s wife was piqued.

"please to know, monsieur porthos," said she, "that my strongbox, the
strongbox of a procuratorâ€™s wife though it may be, is better filled than
those of your affected minxes."

"that doubles the offense," said porthos, disengaging his arm from that
of the procuratorâ€™s wife; "for if you are rich, madame coquenard, then
there is no excuse for your refusal."

"when i said rich," replied the procuratorâ€™s wife, who saw that she had
gone too far, "you must not take the word literally. i am not precisely
rich, though i am pretty

well off."

"hold, madame," said porthos, "let us say no more upon the subject, i
beg of you. you have misunderstood me, all sympathy is extinct between
us."

"ingrate that you are!"

"ah! i advise you to complain!" said porthos.

"begone, then, to your beautiful duchess; i will detain you no longer."

"and she is not to be despised, in my opinion."

"now, monsieur porthos, once more, and this is the last! do you love me
still?"

"ah, madame," said porthos, in the most melancholy tone he could assume,
"when we are about to enter upon a campaign--a campaign, in which my
presentiments tell me i shall be killed--"

"oh, donâ€™t talk of such things!" cried the procuratorâ€™s wife, bursting
into tears.

"something whispers me so," continued porthos, becoming more and more
melancholy.

"rather say that you have a new love."

"not so; i speak frankly to you. no object affects me; and i even feel
here, at the bottom of my heart, something which speaks fo

r you. but in
fifteen days, as you know, or as you do not know, this fatal campaign is
to open. i shall be fearfully preoccupied with my outfit. then i must
make a journey to see my family, in the lower part of brittany, to
obtain the sum necessary for my departure."

porthos observed a last struggle between love and avarice.

"and as," continued he, "the duchess whom you saw at the church has
estates near to those of my family, we mean to make the journey
together. journeys, you know, appear much shorter when we travel two in
company."

"have you no friends in paris, then, monsieur porthos?" said the
procuratorâ€™s wife.

"i thought i had," said porthos, resuming his melancholy air; "but i
have been taught my mistake."

"you have some!" cried the procuratorâ€™s wif

my aunt, consequently my cousin; you come from noyon, in picardy; you
have several lawsuits and no attorney. can you recollect all that?"

"perfectly, madame."

"come at dinnertime."

"very well."

"and be upon your guard before my husband, who is rather shrewd,
notwithstanding his seventy-six years."

"seventy-six years! peste! thatâ€™s a fine age!" replied porthos.

"a great age, you mean, monsieur porthos. yes, the poor man may be
expected to leave me a widow, any hour," continued she, throwing a
significant glance at porthos. "fortunately, by our marriage contract,
the survivor takes everything."

"all?"

"yes, all."

"you are a woman of precaution, i see, my dear madame coquenard," said
porthos, squeezing the hand of the procuratorâ€™s wife tenderly.

"we are then reconciled, dear monsieur porthos?" said she, simpering.

"for life," replied porthos, in the same manner.

them to athosâ€™s place. once for all, treville had placed his stable at
dâ€™artagnanâ€™s service.

planchet proceeded toward the rue du colombier, and dâ€™artagnan toward
the rue ferou. athos was at home, emptying sadly a bottle of the famous
spanish wine he had brought back with him from his journey into picardy.
he made a sign for grimaud to bring a glass for dâ€™artagnan, and grimaud
obeyed as usual.

dâ€™artagnan related to athos all that had passed at the church between
porthos and the procuratorâ€™s wife, and how their comrade was probably by
that time in a fair way to be equipped.

"as for me," replied athos to this recital, "i am quite at my ease; it
will not be women that will defray the expense of my outfit."

"handsome, well-bred, noble lord as you are, my dear athos, neither
princesses nor queens would be secure from your amorous solicitations."

"how young this dâ€™artagnan is!" said athos, shrugging his shoulders; and
he made a sign to grimaud to bring anothe

horse with the spur, he cantered back to paris. as he was accustomed to
do in all cases of any consequence, dâ€™artagnan went straight to the
residence of athos.

he found athos reclining upon a large sofa, where he was waiting, as he
said, for his outfit to come and find him. he related to athos all that
had passed, except the letter to m. de wardes.

athos was delighted to find he was going to fight an englishman. we
might say that was his dream.

they immediately sent their lackeys for porthos and aramis, and on their
arrival made them acquainted with the situation.

porthos drew his sword from the scabbard, and made passes at the wall,
springing back from time to time, and making contortions like a dancer.

aramis, who was constantly at work at his poem, shut himself up in
athosâ€™s closet, and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of
drawing swords.

athos, by signs, desired grimaud to bring another bottle of wine.

dâ€™artagnan employed himself in arranging a little plan, o

the englishman.

"you played very willingly with us without knowing our names," said
athos, "by the same token that you won our horses."

"that is true, but we then only risked our pistoles; this time we risk
our blood. one plays with anybody; but one fights only with equals."

"and that is but just," said athos, and he took aside the one of the
four englishmen with whom he was to fight, and communicated his name in
a low voice.

porthos and aramis did the same.

"does that satisfy you?" said athos to his adversary. "do you find me of
sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me?"

"yes, monsieur," said the englishman, bowing.

"well! now shall i tell you something?" added athos, coolly.

"what?" replied the englishman.

"why, that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not
required me to make myself known."

"why so?"

"because i am believed to be dead, and have reasons for wishing nobody

not jest the least in the world.

"gentlemen," said athos, addressing at the same time his companions and
their adversaries, "are we ready?"

"yes!" answered the englishmen and the frenchmen, as with one voice.

"on guard, then!" cried athos.

immediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun, and
the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice
enemies.

athos fenced with as much calmness and method as if he had been
practicing in a fencing school.

porthos, abated, no doubt, of his too-great confidence by his adventure
of chantilly, played with skill and prudence. aramis, who had the third
canto of his poem to finish, behaved like a man in haste.

athos killed his adversary first. he hit him but once, but as he had
foretold, that hit was a mortal one; the sword pierced his heart.

second, porthos stretched his upon the grass with a wound through his
thigh. as the englishman, without making any further resistance, then
surrendered his sword, porth

his sword to his throat, "i could kill you, my lord, you are completely
in my hands; but i spare your life for the sake of your sister."

dâ€™artagnan was at the height of joy; he had realized the plan he had
imagined beforehand, whose picturing had produced the smiles we noted
upon his face.

the englishman, delighted at having to do with a gentleman of such a
kind disposition, pressed dâ€™artagnan in his arms, and paid a thousand
compliments to the three musketeers, and as porthosâ€™s adversary was
already installed in the carriage, and as aramisâ€™s had taken to his
heels, they had nothing to think about but the dead.

as porthos and aramis were undressing him, in the hope of finding his
wound not mortal, a large purse dropped from his clothes. dâ€™artagnan
picked it up and offered it to lord de winter.

"what the devil would you have me do with that?" said the englishman.

"you can restore it to his family," said dâ€™artagnan.

"his family will care much about such a t

at this time athos came up to dâ€™artagnan.

"what do you mean to do with that purse?" whispered he.

"why, i meant to pass it over to you, my dear athos."

"me! why to me?"

"why, you killed him! they are the spoils of victory."

"i, the heir of an enemy!" said athos; "for whom, then, do you take me?"

"it is the custom in war," said dâ€™artagnan, "why should it not be the
custom in a duel?"

"even on the field of battle, i have never done that."

porthos shrugged his shoulders; aramis by a movement of his lips
endorsed athos.

"then," said dâ€™artagnan, "let us give the money to the lackeys, as lord
de winter desired us to do."

"yes," said athos; "let us give the money to the lackeys--not to our
lackeys, but to the lackeys of the englishmen."

athos took the purse, and threw it into the hand of the coachman. "for
you and your comrades."

this greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even
porthos; and this french generosity,

e to mistake; but dâ€™artagnan was so preoccupied by the mistress
that he noticed absolutely nothing but her.

dâ€™artagnan came again on the morrow and the day after that, and each day
milady gave him a more gracious reception.

every evening, either in the antechamber, the corridor, or on the
stairs, he met the pretty soubrette. but, as we have said, dâ€™artagnan
paid no attention to this persistence of poor kitty.




32 a procuratorâ€™s dinner


however brilliant had been the part played by porthos in the duel, it
had not made him forget the dinner of the procuratorâ€™s wife.

on the morrow he received the last touches of mousquetonâ€™s brush for an
hour, and took his way toward the rue aux ours with the steps of a man
who was doubly in favor with fortune.

his heart beat, but not like dâ€™artagnanâ€™s with a young and impatient
love. no; a more material interest stirred his blood. he was about at
last to pass that mysterious threshold, to climb those unknown stairs by
which, one by one,

self up to those little
attentions which "the harder one is, the more they please," as old
soldiers say.

to come in the capacity of a cousin, and seat himself every day at a
good table; to smooth the yellow, wrinkled brow of the old procurator;
to pluck the clerks a little by teaching them bassette, passe-dix, and
lansquenet, in their utmost nicety, and winning from them, by way of fee
for the lesson he would give them in an hour, their savings of a
month--all this was enormously delightful to porthos.

the musketeer could not forget the evil reports which then prevailed,
and which indeed have survived them, of the procurators of the
period--meanness, stinginess, fasts; but as, after all, excepting some
few acts of economy which porthos had always found very unseasonable,
the procuratorâ€™s wife had been tolerably liberal--that is, be it
understood, for a procuratorâ€™s wife--he hoped to see a household of a
highly comfortable kind.

and yet, at the very door the musketeer began to entertain
 
 ___________________________
 
 some doubts.
the approach was not such as to prepossess people--an ill-smelling, dark
passage, a staircase half-lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer
from a neighboring yard; on the first floor a low door studded with
enormous nails, like the principal gate of the grand chatelet.

porthos knocked with his hand. a tall, pale clerk, his face shaded by a
forest of virgin hair, opened the door, and bowed with the air of a man
forced at once to respect in another lofty stature, which indicated
strength, the military dress, which indicated rank, and a ruddy
countenance, which indicated familiarity with good living.

a shorter clerk came behind the first, a taller clerk behind the second,
a stripling of a dozen years rising behind the third. in all, three
clerks and a half, which, for

he heart, or perhaps the stomach, of her lover would bring him
before his time.

mme. coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same
moment her guest entered from the stairs, and the appearance of the
worthy lady relieved him from an awkward embarrassment. the clerks
surveyed him with great curiosity, and he, not knowing well what to say
to this ascending and descending scale, remained tongue-tied.

"it is my cousin!" cried the procuratorâ€™s wife. "come in, come in,
monsieur porthos!"

the name of porthos produced its effect upon the clerks, who began to
laugh; but porthos turned sharply round, and every countenance quickly
recovered its gravity.

they reached the office of the procurator after having passed through
the antechamber in which the clerks were, and the study in which they
ought to have been. this last apartment was a sort of dark room,
littered with papers. on quitting the study they left the kitchen on the
right, and entered the reception room.

all these roo

ms, which communicated with one another, did not inspire
porthos favorably. words might be heard at a distance through all these
open doors. then, while passing, he had cast a rapid, investigating
glance into the kitchen; and he was obliged to confess to himself, to
the shame of the procuratorâ€™s wife and his own regret, that he did not
see that fire, that animation, that bustle, which when a good repast is
on foot prevails generally in that sanctuary of good living.

the procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit, as he
expressed no surprise at 
 
 ___________________________
 
the sight of porthos, who advanced toward him
with a sufficiently easy air, and saluted him courteously.

"we are cousins, it appears, monsieur porthos?" said the procurator,
rising, yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane chair.

the old man, wrapped in a large black doublet, in which the whole of his
slender body was concealed, was brisk and dry. his little gray eyes
shone like carbuncles, and appeared, with his grinning mouth, to be the
only part of his face in which life survived. unfortunately the legs
began to refuse their service to this bony machine. during the last five
or six months that this weakness had been felt, the w

had nearly become the slave of his wife.

the cousin was received with resignation, that was all. m. coquenard,
firm upon his legs, would have declined all relationship with m.
porthos.

"yes, monsieur, we are cousins," said porthos, without being
disconcerted, as he had never reckoned upon being received
enthusiastically by the husband.

"by the female side, i believe?" said the procurator, maliciously.

porthos did not feel the ridicule of this, and took it for a piece of
simplicity, at which he laughed in his large mustache. mme. coquenard,
who knew that a simple-minded procurator was a very rare variety in the
species, smiled a little, and colored a great deal.

m coquenard had, since the arrival of porthos, frequently cast his eyes
with great uneasiness upon a large chest placed in front of his oak
desk. porthos comprehended that this chest, although it did not
correspond in shape with that which h
 
 ___________________________
 
e had seen in his dreams, must be
the blessed coffer, and he congratulated himself that the reality was
several feet higher than the dream.

m coquenard did not carry his genealogical investigations any further;
but withdrawing his anxious look from the chest and fixing it upon
porthos, he contented himself with saying, "monsieur our cousin will do
us the favor of dining with us once before his departure for the
campaign, will he not, madame coquenard?"

this time porthos received the blow right in his stomach, and felt it.
it appeared likewise that mme. coquenard was not less affected by it on
her part, for she added, "my cousin will not return if he finds that we
do not treat him kindly; but otherwise he has so little time to pass in
paris, and consequently to spare to us, that we must entreat him to give
us every instant he can call his own previous to his departure."

"oh, my legs, my poor legs! where are you?" murmured coquenard, and he
tried to smile.

thi

s succor, which came to porthos at the moment in which he was
attacked in his gastronomic hopes, inspired much gratitude in the
musketeer toward the procuratorâ€™s wife.

the hour of dinner soon arrived. they passed into the eating room--a
large dark room situated opposite the kitchen.

the clerks, who, as it appeared, had smelled unusual perfumes in the
house, were of military punctuality, and held their stools in hand quite
ready to sit down. their jaws moved preliminarily with fearful
threatenings.

"indeed!" thought porth

os, casting a glance at the three hungry
clerks--for the errand boy, as might be expected, was not admitted to
the honors of the magisterial table, "in my cousinâ€™s place, i would not
keep such gourmands! they look like shipwrecked sailors who have not
eaten for six weeks."

m coquenard entered, pushed along upon his armchair with casters by mme.
coquenard, whom porthos assisted in rolling her husband up to the table.
he had scarcely entered when he began to agitate his nose and his jaws
after the example of his clerks.

"oh, oh!" said he; "here is a soup which is rather inviting."

"what the devil can they smell so extraordinary in this soup?" said
porthos, at the sight of a pale liquid, abundant but entirely free from
meat, on the surface of which a few crusts swam about as rare as the
islands of an archipelago.

mme. coquenard smiled, and upon a sign from h
 
 ___________________________
 
er everyone eagerly took
his seat.

m coquenard was served first, then porthos. afterward mme. coquenard
filled her own plate, and distributed the crusts without soup to the
impatient clerks. at this moment the door of the dining room unclosed
with a creak, and porthos perceived through the half-open flap the
little clerk who, not being allowed to take part in the feast, ate his
dry bread in the passage with the double odor of the dining room and
kitchen.

after the soup the maid brought a boiled fowl--a piece of magnificence
which caused the eyes of the diners to dilate in such a manner that they
seemed ready to burst.

"one may see that you love your family, madame coquenard," said the
procurator, with a smile that was almost tragic. "you are certainly
trea
 
 ___________________________
 
ting your cousin very handsomely!"

the poor fowl was thin, and covered with one of those thick, bristly
skins through which the teeth cannot penetrate with all their efforts.
the fowl must have been sought for a long time on the perch, to which it
had retired to die of old age.

"the devil!" thought porthos, "this is poor work. i respect old age, but
i donâ€™t much like it boiled or roasted."

and he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion; but on the
contrary, he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring, in
anticipation, that sublime fowl which was the object of his contempt.

mme. coquenard drew the dish toward her, skillfully detached the two
great black feet, which she placed upon her husbandâ€™s plate, cut off the
neck, which with the head she put on one side for herself,
 
 ___________________________
 
 raised the
wing for porthos, and then returned the bird otherwise intact to the
servant who had brought it in, who disappeared with it before the
musketeer had time to examine the variations which disappointment
produces upon faces, according to the characters and temperaments of
those who experience it.

in the place of the fowl a dish of haricot beans made its appearance--an
enormous dish in which some bones of mutton that at first sight one
might have believed to have some meat on them pretended to show
themselves.

bu
 
 ___________________________
 
t the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit, and their lugubrious
looks settled down into resigned countenances.

mme. coquenard distributed this dish to the young men with the
moderation of a good housewife.

the time for wine came. m. coquenard poured from a very small stone
bottle the third of a glass for each of the young men, served himself in
about the same proportion, and passed the bottle to porthos and mme.
coquenard.

the young men filled up their third of a glass with water; then, when
they had drunk half the glass, they filled it up again, and continued to
do so. this brought them, by the end of the repast, to swallowing a
drink which from the color of the ruby had passed to that of a pale
topaz.

porthos ate his wing of the fowl timidly, and shuddered when he felt the
knee of the procuratorâ€™s wife under the table, as it came in search of
his. he also drank half a glass of this spari
 
 ___________________________
 
ngly served wine, and found
it to be nothing but that horrible montreuil--the terror of all expert
palates.

m coquenard saw him swallowing this wine undiluted, and sighed deeply.

"will you eat any of these beans, cousin porthos?" said mme. coquenard,
in that tone which says, "take my advice, donâ€™t touch them."

"devil take me if i taste one of them!" murmured porthos to himself, and
then said aloud, "thank you, my cousin, i am no longer hungry."

there was silence. porthos could hardly keep his countenance.

the procurator repeated several times, "ah, madame coquenard! accept my
compliments; your dinner has been a real feast. lord, how i have eaten!"

m coquenard had eaten his soup, the black feet of the fowl, and the only
mutton bone on which there was the least appearance of meat.

porthos fancied they were mystifying him, and began to curl his mustache
and knit his eyebrows; but the knee of mme. coquenard gently advised him
to be patient.

this silence and thi
 
 ___________________________
 
s interruption in serving, which were unintelligible
to porthos, had, on the contrary, a terrible meaning for the clerks.
upon a look from the procurator, accompanied by a smile from mme.
coquenard, they arose slowly from the table, folded their napkins more
slowly still, bowed, and retired.

"go, young men! go and promote digestion by working," said the
procurator, gravely.

the clerks gone, mme. coquenard rose and took from a buffet a piece of
cheese, some preserved quinces, and a cake which she had herself made of
almonds and honey.

m coquenard knit his
 
 ___________________________
 
 eyebrows because there were too many good things.
porthos bit his lips because he saw not the wherewithal to dine. he
looked to see if the dish of beans was still there; the dish of beans
had disappeared.

"a positive feast!" cried m. coquenard, turning about in his chair, "a
real feast, epulce epulorum. lucullus dines with lucullus."

porthos looked at the bottle, which was near him, and hoped that with
wine, bread, and cheese, he might make a dinner; but wine was wanting,
the bottle was empty. m. and mme. coquenard did not seem to observe it.

"this is fine!" said porthos to himself; "i am prettily caught!"

he passed his tongue over a spoonful of preserves, and stuck his teeth
into the sticky pastry of mme. coquenard.

"now," said he, "the sacrifice is consummated! ah! if i had not the hope
of peeping with madame coquenard into he
 
 ___________________________
 
r husbandâ€™s chest!"

m coquenard, after the luxuries of such a repast, which he called an
excess, felt the want of a siesta. porthos began to hope that the thing
would take place at the present sitting, and in that same locality; but
the procurator would listen to nothing, he would be taken to his room,
and was not satisfied till he was close to his chest, upon the edge of
which, for still greater precaution, he placed his feet.

the procuratorâ€™s wife took porthos into an adjoining room, and they
began to lay the basis of a reconciliation.

"you can come and dine three times a week," said mme. coquenard.

"thanks, madame!" said porthos, "but i donâ€™t like to abuse your
kindness; besides, i must think of my outfit!"

"thatâ€™s true," said the procuratorâ€™s wife, groaning, "that unfortunate
outfit!"

"alas, yes," said porthos, "it is so."

"but of what, then, does the equipment of your company consist, monsieur
porthos?"

"oh, of many things!" said porth
 
 ___________________________
 
os. "the musketeers are, as you know,
picked soldiers, and they require many things useless to the guardsmen
or the swiss."

"but yet, detail them to me."

"why, they may amount to--", said porthos, who preferred discussing the
total to taking them one by one.

the procuratorâ€™s wife waited tremblingly.

"to how much?" said she. "i hope it does not exceed--" she stopped;
speech failed her.

"oh, no," said porthos, "it does not exceed two thousand five hundred
livres! i even think that with economy i could manage it with two
thousand livres."

"good god!" cried she, "two thousand livres! why, that is a fortune!"

porthos made a most significant grimace; mme. coquenard understood it.

"i wished to know the detail," said she, "because, having many relatives
in business, i was almost sure of obtaining things at a hundred per cent
less than you would pay yourself."

"ah, ah!" said porthos, "that is what you 
 
 ___________________________
 
meant to say!"

"yes, dear monsieur porthos. thus, for instance, donâ€™t you in the first
place want a horse?"

"yes, a horse."

"well, then! i can just suit you."

"ah!" said porthos, brightening, "thatâ€™s well as regards my horse; but i
must have the appointments complete, as they include objects which a
musketeer alone can purchase, and which will not amount, besides, to
more than three hundred livres."

"three hundred livres? then put down three hundred livres," said the
procuratorâ€™s wife, with a sigh.

porthos smiled. it may be remembered that he had the saddle which came
from buckingham. these three hundred livres he reckoned upon putting
snugly into his pocket.

"t

hen," continued he, "there is a horse for my lackey, and my valise. as
to my arms, it is useless to trouble you about them; i have them."

"a horse for your lackey?" resumed the procuratorâ€™s wife, hesitatingly;
"but that is doing things in lordly style, my friend."

"ah, madame!" said porthos, haughtily; "do you take me for a beggar?"

"no; i only thought that a pretty mule makes sometimes as good an
appearance as a horse, and it seemed to me that by getting a pretty mule
for mousqueton--"

"well, agreed for a pretty mule," said porthos; "you are right, i have
seen very great spanish nobles whose whole suite were mounted on mules.
but then you understand, madame coquenard, a mule with feathers and
bells."

"be satisfied," said the procuratorâ€™s wife.

"there remains the valise," ad

ded porthos.

"oh, donâ€™t let that disturb you," cried mme. coquenard. "my husband has
five or six valises; you shall choose the best. there is one in
particular which he prefers in his journeys, large enough to hold all
the world."

"your valise is then empty?" asked porthos, with simplicity.

"certainly it is empty," replied the procuratorâ€™s wife, in real
innocence.

"ah, but the valise i want," cried porthos, "is a well-filled one, my
dear."

madame uttered fresh sighs. moliere had not written his scene in
"lâ€™avare" then. mme. coquenard was in the dilemma of harpagan.

finally, the rest of the equipment was successively debated in the same
manner; and the result of the sitting was that the procuratorâ€™s wife
should give eight hundred livres in money, and should furnish the horse
and the mule which should have the honor of carrying porthos and
mousqueton to glory.

these conditions being agreed t

the latter wished to detain him by darting certain tender glances; but
porthos urged the commands of duty, and the procuratorâ€™s wife was
obliged to give place to the king.

the musketeer returned home hungry and in bad humor.




33 soubrette and mistress


meantime, as we have said, despite the cries of his conscience and the
wise counsels of athos, dâ€™artagnan became hourly more in love with
milady. thus he never failed to pay his diurnal court to her; and the
self-satisfied gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not
fail to respond.

one day, when he ar

h deludes women.
dâ€™artagnan replied in such a manner that kitty remained in her great
delusion. although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the
letter to her mistress, she did at last so decide, which was all
dâ€™artagnan wished. finally he promised that he would leave her
mistressâ€™s presence at an early hour that evening, and that when he left
the mistress he would ascend with the maid. this promise completed poor
kittyâ€™s consolation.




34 in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of


since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments, there
had been no fixed meeting between them. they dined apart from one
another, wherever they might happen to be, or rather where they could.
duty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which was
gliding away so rapidly--only they had agreed to meet once a week, about
one oâ€™clock, at the residence of athos, seeing that he, in agreement
with the vow he had formed, did not pass over the thresho
 
 ___________________________
 
e rue ferou.

he found athos and aramis philosophizing. aramis had some slight
inclination to resume the cassock. athos, according to his system,
neither encouraged nor dissuaded him. athos believed that everyone
should be left to his own free will. he never gave advice but when it
was asked, and even then he required to be asked twice.

"people, in general," he said, "only ask advice not to follow it; or if
they do follow it, it is for the sake of having someone to blame for
having given it."

porthos arrived a minute after dâ€™artagnan. the four friends were
reunited.

the four countenances expressed four different feelings: that of
porthos, tranquillity; that of dâ€™artagnan, hope; that of aramis,
uneasiness; that of athos, carelessness.

at the end of a momentâ€™s conversation, in which porthos hinted that a
lady of elevated rank had condescended to relieve him from his
embarrassment, mousqueton entered. he came to request his master to
return to his lodgings, where his presence was urgen

t, as he piteously
said.

"is it my equipment?"

"yes and no," replied mousqueton.

"well, but canâ€™t you speak?"

"come, monsieur."

porthos rose, saluted his friends, and followed mousqueton. an instant
after, bazin made his appearance at the door.

"what do you want with me, my friend?" said aramis, with that mildness
of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were
directed toward the church.

"a man wishes to see monsieur at home," replied bazin.

"a man! what man?"

"a mendicant."

"give him alms, bazin, and bid him pray for a poor sinner."

"this mendicant insists upon speaking to you, and pretends that y

ou will
be very glad to see him."

"has he sent no particular message for me?"

"yes. if monsieur aramis hesitates to come," he said, "tell him i am
from tours."

"from tours!" cried aramis. "a thousand pardons, gentlemen; but no doubt
this man brings me the news i expected." and rising also, he went off at
a quick pace. there remained athos and dâ€™artagnan.

"i believe these fellows have managed their business. what do you think,
dâ€™artagnan?" said athos.

"i know that porthos was in a fair way," replied dâ€™artagnan; "and as to
aramis to tell you the truth, i have never been seriously uneasy on his
account. but you, my dear athos--you, who so generously distributed the
englishmanâ€™s pistoles, which were our legitimate property--what do you
mean to do?"

"i am satisfied with having killed that fellow, my boy, seeing that it
is blessed bread to kill an englishman; but if i had pocketed his
pistoles, they would have weighed me down like a remorse."

"go to, my dear at

with mother of pearl, in which was the famous handkerchief which served
him as a talisman.

the two friends repaired to athosâ€™s, and he, faithful to his vow of not
going out, took upon him to order dinner to be brought to them. as he
was perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy, dâ€™artagnan and
aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to him.

they went to find porthos, and at the corner of the rue bac met
mousqueton, who, with a most pitiable air, was driving before him a mule
and a horse.

dâ€™artagnan uttered a cry of surprise, which was not quite free from joy.

"ah, my yellow horse," cried he. "aramis, look at that horse!"

"oh, the frightful brute!" said aramis.

"ah, my dear," replied dâ€™artagnan, "upon that very horse i came to
paris."

"what, does monsieur know this horse?" said mousqueton.

"it is of an original color," said aramis; "i never saw on

agnificent spanish genet and an andalusian mule, which were beautiful
to look upon. the husband heard of the affair; on their way he
confiscated the two magnificent beasts which were being sent to us, and
substituted these horrible animals."

"which you are taking back to him?" said dâ€™artagnan.

"exactly!" replied mousqueton. "you may well believe that we will not
accept such steeds as these in exchange for those which had been
promised to us."

"no, pardieu; though i should like to have seen porthos on my yellow
horse. that would give me an idea of how i looked when i arrived in
paris. but donâ€™t let us hinder you, mousqueton; go and perform your
masterâ€™s orders. is he at home?"

"yes, monsieur," said mousqueton, "but in a very ill humor. get up!"

he continued his way toward the quai des grands augustins, while the two
friends went to ring at the bell of the unfortunate porthos. he, having
seen them crossing the yard, took care not to answer, and they rang in
vain.

meanwhile mousqueto

n continued on his way, and crossing the pont neuf,
still driving the two sorry animals before him, he reached the rue aux
ours. arrived there, he fastened, according to the orders of his master,
both horse and mule to the knocker of the procuratorâ€™s door; then,
without taking any thought for their future, he returned to porthos, and
told him that his commission was completed.

in a short time the two unfortunate beasts, who had not eaten anything
since the morning, made such a noise in raising and letting fall the
knocker that the procurator ordered his errand boy to go and inquire in
the neighborhood to whom this horse and mule belonged.

mme. coquenard recognized her present, and could not at first comprehend
this restitution; but the visit of porthos soon enlightened her. the
anger which fired the eyes of the muske

teer, in spite of his efforts to
suppress it, terrified his sensitive inamorata. in fact, mousqueton had
not concealed from his master that he had met dâ€™artagnan and aramis, and
that dâ€™artagnan in the yellow horse had recognized the bearnese pony
upon which he had come to paris, and which he had sold for three crowns.

porthos went away after having appointed a meeting with the procuratorâ€™s
wife in the cloister of st. magloire. the procurator, seeing he was
going, invited him to dinner--an invitation which the musketeer refused
with a majestic air.

mme. coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of st. magloire, for
she guessed the reproaches that awaited her there; but she was
fascinated by the lofty airs of porthos.

shape of imprecations and

let fall upon the bowed head of the procuratorâ€™s wife.

"alas," said she, "i did all for the best! one of our clients is a
horsedealer; he owes money to the office, and is backward in his pay. i
took the mule and the horse for what he owed us; he assured me that they
were two noble steeds."

"well, madame," said porthos, "if he owed you more than five crowns,
your horsedealer is a thief."

"there is no harm in trying to buy things cheap, monsieur porthos," said
the procuratorâ€™s wife, seeking to excuse herself.

"no, madame; but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought
to permit others to seek more generous friends." and porthos, turning on
his heel, made a step to retire.

"monsieur porthos! monsieur porthos!" cried the procuratorâ€™s wife. "i
have been wrong; i see it. i ought not to have driven a bargain when it
was to equip a cavalier like you."

porthos, without reply, retreated a second step. the procuratorâ€™s wife
fancied

she saw him in a brilliant cloud, all surrounded by duchesses
and marchionesses, who cast bags of money at his feet.

"stop, in the name of heaven, monsieur porthos!" cried she. "stop, and
let us talk."

"talking with you brings me misfortune," said porthos.

"but, tell me, what do you ask?"

"nothing; for that amounts to the same thing as if i asked you for
something."

the procuratorâ€™s wife hung upon the arm of porthos, and in the violence
of her grief she cried out, "monsieur porthos, i am ignorant of all such
matters! how should i know what a horse is? how should i know what horse
furniture is?"

"you should have left it to me, then, madame, who knows what they are;
but you wished to be frugal, and consequently to lend at usury."

"it was wrong, monsieur porthos; but i will repair that wrong, upon my
word of honor."

"how so?" asked the musketeer.

"listen. this evening m. coquenard is going to the house of the due de
chaulnes, who has sent for him. it is for a consultatio

accounts."

"in good time. now you talk, my dear."

"you pardon me?"

"we shall see," said porthos, majestically; and the two separated
saying, "till this evening."

"the devil!" thought porthos, as he walked away, "it appears i am
getting nearer to monsieur coquenardâ€™s strongbox at last."

the evening so impatiently waited for by porthos and by dâ€™artagnan at

as was his custom, dâ€™artagnan presented himself at miladyâ€™s at about
nine oâ€™clock. he found her in a charming humor. never had he been so
well received. our gascon knew, by the first glance of his eye, that his
billet had been delivered, and that this billet had had its effect.

"i cannot take you, however, to the siege of la rochelle," aid
dâ€™artagnan.

"no; but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of your
acquaintance--in your own country, for instance."

"my dear little love! in my country the ladies do without chambermaids.
but stop! i can manage your business for you. planchet, go and find
aramis. request him to come here directly. we have something very
important to say to him."

"i understand," said athos; "but why not porthos? i should have thought
that his duchess--"

"oh, porthosâ€™s duchess is dressed by her husbandâ€™s clerks," said
dâ€™artagnan, laughing. "besides, kitty would not like to live in the rue
aux ours. isnâ€™t it so, kitty?"

"i do not care where i live," said kitty, "provided i am well concealed,
and nobody knows where i am."

"meanwhile, kitty, when we are about to separate, and you are no longer
jealous of me--"

"monsieur chevalier, far off or near," said kitty, "i shall always love
you."

tâ€™s a snare," said athos; "donâ€™t go, dâ€™artagnan."

"and yet," replied dâ€™artagnan, "i think i recognize the writing."

"it may be counterfeit," said athos. "between six and seven oâ€™clock the
road of chaillot is quite deserted; you might as well go and ride in the
forest of bondy."

"but suppose we all go," said dâ€™artagnan; "what the devil! they wonâ€™t
devour us all four, four lackeys, horses, arms, and all!"

"and besides, it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments,"
said porthos.

"but if it is a woman who writes," said aramis, "and that woman desires
not to be seen, remember, you compromise her, dâ€™artagnan; which is not
the part of a gentleman."

"we will remain in the background," said porthos, "and he will advance
alone."

"yes; but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a
gallop."

"bah!" said dâ€™artagnan, "they will miss me; if they fire we will ride
after the carriage, and exterminate those who may be in it. they must be
enemies."

"he is

right," said porthos; "battle. besides, we must try our own
arms."

"bah, let us enjoy that pleasure," said aramis, with his mild and
careless manner.

"as you please," said athos.

"gentlemen," said dâ€™artagnan, "it is half past four, and we have
scarcely time to be on the road of chaillot by six."

"besides, if we go out too late, nobody will see us," said porthos, "and
that will be a pity. let us get ready, gentlemen."

"but this second letter," said athos, "you forget that; it appears to
me, however, that the seal denotes that it deserves to be opened. for my
part, i declare, dâ€™artagnan, i think it of much more consequence than
the little piece of waste paper you have so cunningly slipped into your
bosom."

dâ€™artagnan blushed.

"well," said he, "let us see, gentlemen, what are his eminenceâ€™s
commands," and dâ€™artagnan unsealed the letter and rea

other."

"i will go to the second after attending the first," said dâ€™artagnan.
"one is for seven oâ€™clock, and the other for eight; there will be time
for both."

"hum! i would not go at all," said aramis. "a gallant knight cannot
decline a rendezvous with a lady; but a prudent gentleman may excuse
himself from not waiting on his eminence, particularly when he has
reason to believe he is not invited to make his compliments."

"i am of aramisâ€™s opinion," said porthos.

"gentlemen," replied dâ€™artagnan, "i have already received by monsieur de
cavois a similar invitation from his eminence. i neglected it, and on
the morrow a serious misfortune happened to me--constance disappeared.
whatever may ensue, i will go."

"if you are determined," said athos, "do so."

"but the bastille?" said aramis.

"bah! you will get me out if they put me there," said dâ€™artagnan.

"to be sure we will," replied aramis and porthos, with admirable
promptness and decision, as if th

with three musketeers behind him; if we see a close carriage, at all
suspicious in appearance, come out, let us fall upon it. it is a long
time since we have had a skirmish with the guards of monsieur the
cardinal; monsieur de treville must think us dead."

"to a certainty, athos," said aramis, "you were meant to be a general of
the army! what do you think of the plan, gentlemen?"

"admirable!" replied the young men in chorus.

"well," said porthos, "i will run to the hotel, and engage our comrades
to hold themselves in readiness by eight oâ€™clock; the rendezvous, the
place du palais-cardinal. meantime, you see that the lackeys saddle the
horses."

"i have no horse," said dâ€™artagnan; "but that is of no consequence, i
can take one of monsieur de trevilleâ€™s."

"that is not worth while," said aramis, "you can have one of mine."

"one of yours! how many have you, then?" asked dâ€™artagnan.

"three," replied aramis, smiling.

"certes," cr

re forty double pistoles, my dear friend," said dâ€™artagnan,
taking the sum from his pocket; "i know that is the coin in which you
were paid for your poems."

"you are rich, then?" said aramis.

"rich? richest, my dear fellow!"

and dâ€™artagnan chinked the remainder of his pistoles in his pocket.

"send your saddle, then, to the hotel of the musketeers, and your horse
can be brought back with ours."

"very well; but it is already five oâ€™clock, so make haste."

a quarter of an hour afterward porthos appeared at the end of the rue
ferou on a very handsome genet. mousqueton followed him upon an auvergne
horse, small but very handsome. porthos was resplendent with joy and
pride.

at the same time, aramis made his appearance at the other end of the
street upon a superb english charger. bazin followed him upon a roan,
holding by the halter a vigorous mecklenburg horse; this was
dâ€™artagnanâ€™s mount.

the two musketeers met at the gate. athos and dâ€™artagnan watched their
approach from the wi

"the devil!" cried aramis, "you have a magnificent horse there,
porthos."

"yes," replied porthos, "it is the one that ought to have been sent to
me at first. a bad joke of the husbandâ€™s substituted the other; but the
husband has been punished since, and i have obtained full satisfaction."

planchet and grimaud appeared in their turn, leading their mastersâ€™
steeds. dâ€™artagnan and athos put themselves into saddle with their
companions, and all four set forward; athos upon a horse he owed to a
woman, aramis on a horse he owed to his mistress, porthos on a horse he
owed to his procurator

good fortune--the best mistress possible.

the lackeys followed.

as porthos had foreseen, the cavalcade produced a good effect; and if
mme. coquenard had met porthos and seen what a superb appearance he made
upon his handsome spanish genet, she would not have regretted the
bleeding she had inflicted upon the strongbox of her husband.

near the louvre the four friends met with m. de treville, who was
returning from st. germain; he stopped them to offer his compliments
upon their appointments, which in an instant drew round them a hundred
gapers.

dâ€™artagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to m. de treville of
the letter with the great red seal and th

h it was known he would one day take his place; he
was considered beforehand as a comrade. it resulted from these
antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which
they met; besides, it would not be unlikely that they would have an
opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn,
and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready.

athos divided them into three groups, assumed the command of one, gave
the second to aramis, and the third to porthos; and then each group went
and took their watch near an entrance.

dâ€™artagnan, on his part, entered boldly at the principal gate.

although he felt himself ably supported, the young man was not without a
little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase, step by step. his
conduct toward milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery, and he was
very suspicious of the political relations which existed between that
woman and the cardinal. still further, de wardes, whom he had treated so
ill, w

this fear that restrained him, so powerful is the influence of a
truly great character on all that surrounds it.

dâ€™artagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered, and found
athos and the four musketeers waiting his appearance, and beginning to
grow uneasy. with a word, dâ€™artagnan reassured them; and planchet ran to
inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer, as
his master had come out safe from the palais-cardinal.

returned home with athos, aramis and porthos inquired eagerly the cause
of the strange interview; but dâ€™artagnan confined himself to telling
them that m. de richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter
into his guards with the rank of ensign, and that he had refused.

"and you were right," cried aramis and porthos, with one voice.

athos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing. but when they
were alone he said, "you have done that which you ought to have done,
dâ€™artagnan; but perhaps you have been wrong."

ring. in fact, the evening before, a fever had seized him
in the midst of the parliament, while he was holding his bed of justice.
he had, not the less, decided upon setting out that same evening; and in
spite of the remonstrances that had been offered to him, he persisted in
having the review, hoping by setting it at defiance to conquer the
disease which began to lay hold upon him.

the review over, the guards set forward alone on their march, the
musketeers waiting for the king, which allowed porthos time to go and
take a turn in his superb equipment in the rue aux ours.

the procuratorâ€™s wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine
horse. she loved porthos too dearly to allow him to part thus; she made
him a sign to dismount and come to her. porthos was magnificent; his
spurs jingled, his cuirass glittered, his sword knocked proudly against
his ample limbs. this time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh,
such a real ear clipper did porthos appear.

the musketeer was introdu

sparkled with anger at seeing his cousin all blazing new. nevertheless,
one thing afforded him inward consolation; it was expected by everybody
that the campaign would be a severe one. he whispered a hope to himself
that this beloved relative might be killed in the field.

porthos paid his compliments to m. coquenard and bade him farewell. m.
coquenard wished him all sorts of prosperities. as to mme. coquenard,
she could not restrain her tears; but no evil impressions were taken
from her grief as she was known to be very much attached to her
relatives, about whom she was constantly having serious disputes with
her husband.

but the real adieux were made in mme. coquenardâ€™s chamber; they were
heartrending.

as long as the procuratorâ€™s wife could follow him with her ey

waved her handkerchief to him, leaning so far out of the window as to
lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself. porthos
received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such
demonstrations, only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his
hat gracefully, and waved it to her as a sign of adieu.

on his part aramis wrote a long letter. to whom? nobody knew. kitty, who
was to set out that evening for tours, was waiting in the next chamber.

athos sipped the last bottle of his spanish wine.

in the meantime dâ€™artagnan was defiling with his company. arriving at

had been held; but on rising from his bed of justice on the
twenty-eighth of june, he felt himself attacked by fever. he was,
notwithstanding, anxious to set out; but his illness becoming more
serious, he was forced to stop at villeroy.

now, whenever the king halted, the musketeers halted. it followed that
dâ€™artagnan, who was as yet purely and simply in the guards, found
himself, for the time at least, separated from his good friends--athos,
porthos, and aramis. this separation, which was no more than an
unpleasant circumstance, would have certainly become a cause of serious
uneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was
surrounded.

he, however, arrived without accident in the camp established before la
rochelle, on the tenth of the month of september of the year 1627.

everything was in the same state. the duke of buckingham and his
english, masters of the isle of re, continued to besiege, but without
success, the

side the french were besieging la rochelle.

dâ€™artagnan, as we have said, had become more tranquil, as always happens
after a past danger, particularly when the danger seems to have
vanished. he only felt one uneasiness, and that was at not hearing any
tidings from his friends.

but one morning at the commencement of the month of november everything
was explained to him by this letter, dated from villeroy:

m dâ€™artagnan,

mm athos, porthos, and aramis, after having had an entertainment at my
house and enjoying themselves very much, created such a disturbance that
the provost of the castle, a rigid man, has ordered them to be confined
for some days; but i accomplish the order they have given me by
forwarding to you a dozen bottles of my anjou wine, with which they are
much pleased. they are desirous that you should drink to their health in
their favorite wine. i have done this, and am, monsieur, with great

and m. de treville, who detected him at once.

the ceremony of reception over, the four friends were soon in one
anotherâ€™s arms.

"pardieu!" cried dâ€™artagnan, "you could not have arrived in better time;
the dinner cannot have had time to get cold! can it, gentlemen?" added
the young man, turning to the two guards, whom he introduced to his
friends.

"ah, ah!" said porthos, "it appears we are feasting!"

"i hope," said aramis, "there are no women at your dinner."

"is there any drinkable wine in your tavern?" asked athos.

"well, pardieu! there is yours, my dear friend," replied dâ€™artagnan.

"our wine!" said athos, astonished.

"yes, that you sent me."

"we sent you wine?"

"you know very well--the wine from the hills of anjou."

"yes, i know what brand you are talking about."

"the wine you prefer."

"well, in the absence of champagne and chambertin, you must

content
yourselves with that."

"and so, connoisseurs in wine as we are, we have sent you some anjou
wine?" said porthos.

"not exactly, it is the wine that was sent by your order."

"on our account?" said the three musketeers.

"did you send this wine, aramis?" said athos.

"no; and you, porthos?"

"no; and you, athos?"

"no!"

"if it was not you, it was your purveyor," said dâ€™artagnan.

"our purveyor!"

"yes, your purveyor, godeau--the purveyor of the musketeers."

"my faith! never mind where it comes from," said porthos, "let us taste
it, and if it is good, let us drink it."

"no," said athos; "donâ€™t let us drink wine which comes from an unknown
source."

"you are right, athos," said dâ€™artagnan. "did none of you charge your
purveyor, godeau, to send me some wine?"

"no! and yet
 
 ___________________________
 
 you say he has sent you some as from us?"

"here is his letter," said dâ€™artagnan, and he presented the note to his
comrades.

"this is not his writing!" said athos. "i am acquainted with it; before
we left villeroy i settled the accounts of the regiment."

"a false letter altogether," said porthos, "we have not been
disciplined."

"dâ€™artagnan," said aramis, in a reproachful tone, "how could you believe
that we had made a disturbance?"

dâ€™artagnan grew pale, and a convulsive trembling shook all his limbs.

"thou alarmest me!" said athos, who never used thee and thou but upon
very particular occasions, "what has happened?"

"look you, my friends!" cried dâ€™artagnan, "a horrible suspicion crosses
my mind! can this be another vengeance of that woman?"

it was now athos who turned pale.

"do not think so, brisemont," said dâ€™artagnan; "do not think so. i swear
to you, i protest--"

"oh, but god is above! god will punish you! my god, grant that he may
one day suffer what i suffer!"

"upon the gospel," said dâ€™artagnan, throwing himself down by the dying
man, "i swear to you that the wine was poisoned and that i was going to
drink of it as you did."

"i do not believe you," cried the soldier, and he expired amid horrible
tortures.

"frightful! frightful!" murmured athos, while porthos broke the bottles
and aramis gave orders, a little too late, that a confessor should be
sent for.

"oh, my friends," said dâ€™artagnan, "you come once more to save my life,
not only mine but that of these gentlemen. gentlemen," continued he,
addressing the guardsmen, "i request you will be silent with regard to
this adventure. great personages may have had a hand in what you have
seen, and if talked about, the evil would only recoil upon us."

"ah, monsieur!" stammered planchet, more dead than

"planchet," said dâ€™artagnan, "i commit the corpse of this poor devil to
your care. let him be interred in holy ground. he committed a crime, it
is true; but he repented of it."

and the four friends quit the room, leaving to planchet and fourreau the
duty of paying mortuary honors to brisemont.

the host gave them another chamber, and served them with fresh eggs and
some water, which athos went himself to draw at the fountain. in a few
words, porthos and aramis were posted as to the situation.

"well," said dâ€™artagnan to athos, "you see, my dear friend, that this is
war to the death."

athos shook his head.

"yes, yes," replied he, "i perceive that plainly; but do you really
believe it is she?"

"i am sure of it."

"nevertheless, i confess i still doubt."

"but the fleur-de-lis on her shoulder?"

"she is some englishwoman who has committed a crime in france, and has
been branded in consequence."

"athos, she is your wife, i tell you," rep

"good," cried athos, "good! yes, my dear aramis, we all know that your
views have a religious tendency."

"i am only temporarily a musketeer," said aramis, humbly.

"it is some time since we heard from his mistress," said athos, in a low
voice. "but take no notice; we know all about that."

"well," said porthos, "it appears to me that the means are very simple."

"what?" asked dâ€™artagnan.

"you say she is in a convent?" replied porthos.

"yes."

"very well. as soon as the siege is over, weâ€™ll carry her off from that
convent."

"but we must first learn what convent she is in."

"thatâ€™s true," said porthos.

"but i think i have it," said athos. "donâ€™t you say, dear dâ€™artagnan,
that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her?"

"i believe so, at least."

"in that case porthos wi

"and how so, if you please?"

"why, by your marchioness, your duchess, your princess. she must have a

"hush!" said porthos, placing a finger on his lips. "i believe her to be
a cardinalist; she must know nothing of the matter."

"then," said aramis, "i take upon myself to obtain intelligence of her."

"you, aramis?" cried the three friends. "you! and how?"

"by the queenâ€™s almoner, to whom i am very intimately allied," said
aramis, coloring.

and on this assurance, the four friends, who had finished their modest
repast, separated, with the promise of meeting again that evening.

on their part the musketeers, who had not much to do with the siege,
were not under very strict orders and led a joyous life. this was the
more easy for our three companions in particular; for being friends of
m. de treville, they obtained from him special permission to be absent
after the closing of the camp.

now, one evening when dâ€™artagnan, who was in the trenches, was not able
to accompany them, athos, porthos, and aramis, mounted on their battle
steeds, enveloped in their war cloaks, with their hands upon their
pistol butts, were returning from a drinking place called the red
dovecot, which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to
jarrie, following the road which led to the camp and quite on their
guard, as we have stated, for fear of an ambuscade, when, about a

interrogated them had the right to do so.

"what company?"

"company of treville."

"advance, and give an account of what you are doing here at this hour."

the three companions advanced rather humbly--for all were now convinced
that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselves--leaving
athos the post of speaker.

one of the two riders, he who had spoken second, was ten paces in front
of his companion. athos made a sign to porthos and aramis also to remain
in the rear, and advanced alone.

"your pardon, my officer," said athos; "but we were ignorant with whom
we had to do, and you may see that we were keeping good guard."

"your name?" said the officer, who covered a part of his face with his
cloak.

"but yourself, monsieur," said athos, who began to be annoyed by this
inquisition, "give me, i beg you, the proof that you have the right to
question me."

"your name?" repeated the cavalier a second time, letting his cloak

 be known i have left the camp; and if they follow us we shall
be certain they will tell nobody."

"we are gentlemen, monseigneur," said athos; "require our parole, and
give yourself no uneasiness. thank god, we can keep a secret."

the cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker.

"you have a quick ear, monsieur athos," said the cardinal; "but now
listen to this. it is not from mistrust that i request you to follow me,
but for my security. your companions are no doubt messieurs porthos and
aramis."

"yes, your eminence," said athos, while the two musketeers who had
remained behind advanced hat in hand.

"i know you, gentlemen," said the cardinal, "i know you. i know you are
not quite my friends, and i am sorry you are not so; but i know you are
brave and loyal gentlemen, and that confidence may be placed in you.
monsieur athos, do me, then, the honor to accompany me; you and your two
friends, and then i shall have an escort to excite envy in his majesty,

him who offended me round the body, and threw him out of the window. it
appears that in falling," continued athos, with some hesitation, "he
broke his thigh."

"ah, ah!" said the cardinal; "and you, monsieur porthos?"

"i, monseigneur, knowing that dueling is prohibited--i seized a bench,
and gave one of those brigands such a blow that i believe his shoulder
is broken."

"very well," said the cardinal; "and you, monsieur aramis?"

"monseigneur, being of a very mild disposition, and being, likewise, of
which monseigneur perhaps is not aware, about to enter into orders, i
endeavored to appease my comrades, when one of these wretches gave me a
wound with a sword, treacherously, across my left arm. then i admi

44 the utility of stovepipes


it was evident that without suspecting it, and actuated solely by their
chivalrous and adventurous character, our three friends had just
rendered a service to someone the cardinal honored with his special
protection.

now, who was that someone? that was the question the three musketeers
put to one another. then, seeing that none of their replies could throw
any light on the subject, porthos called the host and asked for dice.

porthos and aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play.
athos walked about in a contemplative mood.

while thinking and walking, athos passed and repassed before the pipe of
the stove, broken in halves, the other extremity passing into the
chamber above; and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur
of words, which at length fixed his attention. athos went close to it,
and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an int

duelist, and a traitor."

"an infamous scoundrel, monseigneur, a scoundrel!"

"give me paper, a quill, and some ink, then," said the cardinal.

"here they are, monseigneur."

there was a moment of silence, which proved that the cardinal was
employed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note, or else
in writing it. athos, who had not lost a word of the conversation, took
his two companions by the hand, and led them to the other end of the
room.

"well," said porthos, "what do you want, and why do you not let us
listen to the end of the conversation?"

"hush!" said athos, speaking in a low voice. "we have heard all it was
necessary we should hear; besides, i donâ€™t prevent you from listening,
but i must be gone."

"you must be gone!" said porthos; "and if the cardinal asks for you,
what answer can we make?"

"you will not wait till he asks; you will speak first, and tell him that
i am gone on the lookout, because certain expressions of our host have
given

me reason to think the road is not safe. i will say two words
about it to the cardinalâ€™s esquire likewise. the rest concerns myself;
donâ€™t be uneasy about that."

"be prudent, athos," said aramis.

"be easy on that head," replied athos; "you know i am cool enough."

porthos and aramis resumed their places by the stovepipe.

as to athos, he went out without any mystery, took his horse, which was
tied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters, in
four words convinced the attendant of the necessity of a vanguard for
their return, carefully examined the priming of his pistols, drew his
sword, and took, like a forlorn hope, the road to the camp.




45 a conjugal scene


as athos had foreseen, it was not long before the cardinal came down. he
opened t
 
 ___________________________
 
he door of the room in which the musketeers were, and found
porthos playing an earnest game of dice with aramis. he cast a rapid
glance around the room, and perceived that one of his men was missing.

"what has become of monseigneur athos?" asked he.

"monseigneur," replied porthos, "he has gone as a scout, on account of
some words of our host, which made him believe the road was not safe."

"and you, what have you done, monsieur porthos?"

"i have won five pistoles of aramis."

"well; now will you return with me?"

"we are at your eminenceâ€™s orders."

"to horse, then, gentlemen; for it is getting late."

the attendant was at the door, holding the cardinalâ€™s horse by the
bridle. at a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared
in the shade. these were the two men who were to conduct milady to fort
la pointe, and superintend her embarkation.

the attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two musketeers had

utmost and stopping occasionally to
listen.

in one of those halts he heard the steps of several horses on the road.
he had no doubt it was the cardinal and his escort. he immediately made
a new point in advance, rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves
of trees, and placed himself across the road, about two hundred paces
from the camp.

"who goes there?" cried he, as soon as he perceived the horsemen.

"that is our brave musketeer, i think," said the cardinal.

"yes, monseigneur," said porthos, "it is he."

"monsieur athos," said richelieu, "receive my thanks for the good guard
you have kept. gentlemen, we are arrived; take the gate on the left. the
watchword is, â€™king and re.â€™"

saying these words, the cardinal saluted the three friends with an
inclination of his head, and took the right hand, followed by his
attendant--for that night he himself slept in the camp.

"well!" said porthos and aramis together, as soon as the cardinal was
out of hearing, "well, he signed the paper sh

to him and claim her vengeance.

in consequence, after having traveled all night, at seven oâ€™clock she
was at the fort of the point; at eight oâ€™clock she had embarked; and at
nine, the vessel, which with letters of marque from the cardinal was
supposed to be sailing for bayonne, raised anchor, and steered its
course toward england.




46 the bastion saint-gervais


on arriving at the lodgings of his three friends, dâ€™artagnan found them
assembled in the same chamber. athos was meditating; porthos was
twisting his mustache; aramis was saying his prayers in a charming
little book of hours, bound in blue velvet.

"pardieu, gentlemen," said he. "i hope what you have to tell me is worth
the trouble, or else, i warn you, i will not pardon you for making me
come here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking
and dismantling a bastion. ah, why were you not there, gentlemen? it was
warm work."

"we were in a place where it was not very cold," replied porthos, giving
his must

now if you were left alone, and nobody interrupted you."

"why, i think there were not many intruders. yes, athos, i know what you
mean: we shall do very well at the parpaillot."

"let us go to the parpaillot, then, for here the walls are like sheets
of paper."

dâ€™artagnan, who was accustomed to his friendâ€™s manner of acting, and who
perceived immediately, by a word, a gesture, or a sign from him, that
the circumstances were serious, took athosâ€™s arm, and went out without
saying anything. porthos followed, chatting with aramis.

on their way they met grimaud. athos made him a sign to come with them.
grimaud, according to custom, obeyed in silence; the poor lad had nearly
come to the pass of forgetting how to speak.

they arrived at the drinking room of the parpaillot. it was seven
oâ€™clock in the morning, and daylight began to appear. the three friends
ordered breakfast, and went into a room in which the host said they
would not be disturbed.

unfortunately, the hour was badly chosen f

two large iron dogs which held the firebrands in the chimney, "stop a

not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable bird."

"you was right," said the swiss; "goose grease is kood with basdry."

"there!" said the dragoon. "now for the wager! we listen, monsieur
athos."

"yes, the wager!" said the light-horseman.

"well, monsieur de busigny, i will bet you," said athos, "that my three
companions, messieurs porthos, aramis, and dâ€™artagnan, and myself, will
go and breakfast in the bastion st. gervais, and we will remain there an
hour, by the watch, whatever the enemy may do to dislodge us."

porthos and aramis looked at each other; they began to comprehend.

"but," said dâ€™artagnan, in the ear of athos, "you are going to get us
all killed without mercy."

"we are much more likely to be killed," said athos, "if we do not go."

"my faith, gentlemen," said porthos, turning round upon his chair and
twisting

"it appears to me," said dâ€™artagnan, with that prudence which allied
itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery, "that we could have
found some retired place on the downs or the seashore."

"where we should have been seen all four conferring together, so that at
the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by
his spies that we were holding a council."

"yes," said aramis, "athos is right: animadvertuntur in desertis."

"a desert would not have been amiss," said porthos; "but it behooved us
to find it."

"there is no desert where a bird cannot pass over oneâ€™s head, where a
fish cannot leap out of the water, where a rabbit cannot come out of its
burrow, and i believe that bird, fish, and rabbit each becomes a spy of
the cardinal. better, then, pursue our enterprise; from which, besides,
we cannot retreat without shame. we have made a wager--a wager which
could not have been foreseen, and of which i defy anyone to divine the
true cause. we are going, in order

walls of the bastion have no ears; if we are, we will talk of our
affairs just the same. moreover, in defending ourselves, we shall cover
ourselves with glory. you see that everything is to our advantage."

"yes," said dâ€™artagnan; "but we shall indubitably attract a ball."

"well, my dear," replied athos, "you know well that the balls most to be
dreaded are not from the enemy."

"but for such an expedition we surely ought to have brought our
muskets."

"you are stupid, friend porthos. why should we load ourselves with a
useless burden?"

"i donâ€™t find a good musket, twelve cartridges, and a powder flask very
useless in the face of an enemy."

"well," replied athos, "have you not heard what dâ€™artagnan said?"

"what did he say?" demanded porthos.

"dâ€™artagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten frenchmen
were killed, and as many rochellais."

"what then?"

"the bodies were not plundered, were they? it appears the conquerors had
something else to do."

"we

ll?"

"well, we shall find their muskets, their cartridges, and their flasks;
and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls, we shall have fifteen
guns and a hundred charges to fire."

"oh, athos!" said aramis, "truly you are a great man."

porthos nodded in sign of agreement. dâ€™artagnan alone did not seem
convinced.

grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man, for seeing that
they continued to advance toward the bastion--something he had till then
doubted--he pulled his master by the skirt of his coat.

"where are we going?" asked he, by a gesture.

athos pointed to the bastion.

"but," said grimaud, in the same silent dialect, "we shall leave our
skins there."

athos raised his eyes and his finger toward heaven.

grimaud

47 the council of the musketeers


as athos had foreseen, the bastion was only occupied by a dozen corpses,
french and rochellais.

"gentlemen," said athos, who had assumed the command of the expedition,
"while grimaud spreads the table, let us begin by collecting the guns
and cartridges together. we can talk while performing that necessary
task. these gentlemen," added he, pointing to the bodies, "cannot hear
us."

"but we could throw them into the ditch," said porthos, "after having
assured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets."

"yes," said athos, "thatâ€™s grimaudâ€™s business."

"well, then," cried dâ€™artagnan, "pray let grimaud search them and throw
them over the walls."

"heaven forfend!" said athos; "they may serve us."

"these bodies serve us?" said porthos. "you are mad, dear friend."

"judge not rashly, say the gospel and the cardinal," replied athos. "how
many guns, gentlemen?"

"twelve," replied aramis.

"how many shots?"

"a hundred."

"

 spilling the contents."

"you saw your wi--"

"hush!" interrupted athos. "you forget, my dear, you forget that these
gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself. i have
seen milady."

"where?" demanded dâ€™artagnan.

"within two leagues of this place, at the inn of the red dovecot."

"in that case i am lost," said dâ€™artagnan.

"not so bad yet," replied athos; "for by this time she must have quit
the shores of france."

dâ€™artagnan breathed again.

"but after all," asked porthos, "who is milady?"

"a charming woman!" said athos, sipping a glass of sparkling wine.
"villainous host!" cried he, "he has given us anjou wine instead of
champagne, and fancies we know no better! yes," continued he, "a
charming woman, who entertained kind views toward our friend dâ€™artagnan,
who, on his part, has given her some offense for which she tried to
revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots, a
week ago by trying to poison him, and yesterday by demanding his

head of
the cardinal."

"what! by demanding my head of the cardinal?" cried dâ€™artagnan, pale
with terror.

"yes, that is true as the gospel," said porthos; "i heard her with my
own ears."

"i also," said aramis.

"then," said dâ€™artagnan, letting his arm fall with discouragement, "it
is useless to struggle longer. i may as well blow my brains out, and all
will be over."

"thatâ€™s the last folly to be committed," said athos, "seeing it is the
only one for which there is no remedy."

"but i can never escape," said dâ€™artagnan, "with such enemies. first, my
stranger of meung; then de wardes, to whom i have given three sword
wounds; next milady, w

 making, we are about to
have to do with a very different number of people. what is it, grimaud?
considering the gravity of the occasion, i permit you to speak, my
friend; but be laconic, i beg. what do you see?"

"a troop."

"of how many persons?"

"twenty men."

"what sort of men?"

"sixteen pioneers, four soldiers."

"how far distant?"

"five hundred paces."

"good! we have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of
wine to your health, dâ€™artagnan."

"to your health!" repeated porthos and aramis.

"well, then, to my health! although i am very much afraid that your good
wishes will not be of great service to me."

"bah!" said athos, "god is great, as say the followers of mohammed, and
the future is in his hands."

then, swallowing the contents of his glass, which he put down close to
him, athos arose carelessly, took the musket next to him, and drew near
to one of the loopholes.

porthos, aramis and dâ€™artagnan followed his example. as to grimaud, he
received orders to place

 mattocks, and shovels.
grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away, and i am convinced they
would have left us in peace."

"i doubt that," replied dâ€™artagnan, "for they are advancing very
resolutely. besides, in addition to the pioneers, there are four
soldiers and a brigadier, armed with muskets."

"thatâ€™s because they donâ€™t see us," said athos.

"my faith," said aramis, "i must confess i feel a great repugnance to
fire on these poor devils of civilians."

"he is a bad priest," said porthos, "who has pity for heretics."

"in truth," said athos, "aramis is right. i will warn them."

"what the devil are you going to do?" cried dâ€™artagnan, "you will be
shot."

but athos heeded not his advice. mounting on the breach, with his musket
in one hand and his hat in the other, he said, bowing courteously and
addressing the soldiers and the pioneers, who, astonished at this
apparition, stopped fifty paces from the bastion: "gentlemen, a few
friends and myself are about to breakfast in this

n, "you care little if she kills buckingham or
causes him to be killed? but the duke is our friend."

"the duke is english; the duke fights against us. let her do what she
likes with the duke; i care no more about him than an empty bottle." and
athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had
poured the last drop into his glass.

"a moment," said dâ€™artagnan. "i will not abandon buckingham thus. he
gave us some very fine horses."

"and moreover, very handsome saddles," said porthos, who at the moment
wore on his cloak the lace of his own.

"besides," said aramis, "god desires the conversion and not the death of
a sinner."

"amen!" said athos, "and we will return to that subject later, if such
be your pleasure; but what for the moment engaged my attention most
earnestly, and i am sure you will understand me, dâ€™artagnan, was the
getting from this woman a kind of carte blanche which she had extorted
from the cardinal, and by means of which she could with impunity get rid
o

f you and perhaps of us."

"but this creature must be a demon!" said porthos, holding out his plate
to aramis, who was cutting up a fowl.

"and this carte blanche," said dâ€™artagnan, "this carte blanche, does it
remain in her hands?"

"no, it passed into mine; i will not say without trouble, for if i did i
should tell a lie."

"my dear athos, i shall no longer count the number of times i am
indebted to you for my life."

"then it was to go to her that you left us?" said aramis.

"exactly."

"and you have that letter of the cardinal?" said dâ€™artagnan.

"here it is," s

said dâ€™artagnan, who fancied he
read in it his sentence of death.

"on the contrary," said athos, "it must be preserved carefully. i would
not give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces."

"and what will she do now?" asked the young man.

"why," replied athos, carelessly, "she is probably going to write to the
cardinal that a damned musketeer, named athos, has taken her
safe-conduct from her by force; she will advise him in the same letter
to get rid of his two friends, aramis and porthos, at the same time. the
cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often
crossed his path; and then some fine morning he will arrest dâ€™artagnan,
and for fear he should feel lonely, he will send us to keep him company
in the bastille."

"go to! it appears to me you make dull jokes, my dear," said porthos.

"i do not jest," said athos.

"do you know," said porthos, "that to twist that damned miladyâ€™s neck
would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of

nots, who have committed no other crime than singing in french the
psalms we sing in latin?"

"what says the abbe?" asked athos, quietly.

"i say i am entirely of porthosâ€™s opinion," replied aramis.

"and i, too," said dâ€™artagnan.

"fortunately, she is far off," said porthos, "for i confess she would
worry me if she were here."

"she worries me in england as well as in france," said athos.

"she worries me everywhere," said dâ€™artagnan.

"but when you held her in your power, why did you not drown her,
strangle her, hang her?" said porthos. "it is only the dead who do not
return."

"you think so, porthos?" replied the musketeer, with a sad smile which
dâ€™artagnan alone understood.

"i have an idea," said dâ€™artagnan.

"what is it?" said the musketeers.

"to arms!

" cried grimaud.

the young men sprang up, and seized their muskets.

this time a small troop advanced, consisting of from twenty to
twenty-five men; but they were not pioneers, they were soldiers of the
garrison.

"shall we return to the camp?" said porthos. "i donâ€™t think the sides
are equal."

"impossible, for three reasons," replied athos. "the first, that we have
not finished breakfast; the second, that we still have some very
important things to say; and the third, that it yet wants ten minutes
before the lapse of the hour."

"well, then," said aramis, "we must form a plan of battle."

"thatâ€™s very simple," replied athos. "as soon as the enemy are within
musket shot, we must fire upon them. if they continue to advance, we
must fire again.
 
 ___________________________
 
 we must fire as long as we have loaded guns. if those
who remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault, we will allow
the besiegers to get as far as the ditch, and then we will push down
upon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a
miracle."

"bravo!" cried porthos. "decidedly, athos, you were born to be a
general, and the cardinal, who fancies himself a great soldier, is
nothing beside you."

"gentlemen," said athos, "no divided attention, i beg; let each one pick
out his man."

"i cover mine," said dâ€™artagnan.

"and i mine," said porthos.

"and i mine," said aramis.

"fire, then," said athos.

the four muskets made but one report, but four men fell.

the drum immediately beat, and the little troop advanced at charging
pace.

then the shots were repeat

them at a blow. to the wall; to
the wall!"

and the four friends, seconded by grimaud, pushed with the barrels of
their muskets an enormous sheet of the wall, which bent as if pushed by
the wind, and detaching itself from its base, fell with a horrible crash
into the ditch. then a fearful crash was heard; a cloud of dust mounted
toward the sky--and all was over!

"can we have destroyed them all, from the first to the last?" said
athos.

"my faith, it appears so!" said dâ€™artagnan.

"no," cried porthos; "there go three or four, limping away."

in fact, three or four of these unfortunate men, covered with dirt and
blood, fled along the hollow way, and at length regained the city. these
were all who were left of the little troop.

athos looked at his watch.

"gentlemen," said he, "we have been here an hour, and our wager is won;
but we will be fair players. besides, dâ€™artagnan has not told us his
idea yet."

and the musketeer, with his usual coolness, reseated himself before the
remains of th

rtagnan.

"yes; you said you had an idea," said athos.

"oh, i remember," said dâ€™artagnan. "well, i will go to england a second
time; i will go and find buckingham."

"you shall not do that, dâ€™artagnan," said athos, coolly.

"and why not? have i not been there once?"

"yes; but at that period we were not at war. at that period buckingham
was an ally, and not an enemy. what you would now do amounts to
treason."

dâ€™artagnan perceived the force of this reasoning, and was silent.

"but," said porthos, "i think i have an idea, in my turn."

"silence for monsieur porthosâ€™s idea!" said aramis.

"i will ask leave of absence of monsieur de treville, on some pretext or
other which you must invent; i am not very clever at pretexts. milady
does not know me; i will get access to her without her suspecting me,
and when i catch my beauty, i will strangle her."

"well," replied athos, "i am not far from approving the idea of monsieur
porthos."

"for shame!" said aramis. "kill a woman? no, listen to m

e; i have the
true idea."

"let us see your idea, aramis," said athos, who felt much deference for
the young musketeer.

"we must inform the queen."

"ah, my faith, yes!" said porthos and dâ€™artagnan, at the same time; "we
are coming nearer to it now."

"inform the queen!" said athos; "and how? have we relations with the
court? could we send anyone to paris without its being known in the
camp? from here to paris it is a hundred and forty leagues; before our
letter was at angers we should be in a dungeon."

"as to remitting a letter with safety to her majesty," said aramis,
coloring, "i will take that upon myself. i know a clever person at
tours--"

aramis stopped on seeing

athos smile.

"well, do you not adopt this means, athos?" said dâ€™artagnan.

"i do not reject it altogether," said athos; "but i wish to remind
aramis that he cannot quit the camp, and that nobody but one of
ourselves is trustworthy; that two hours after the messenger has set
out, all the capuchins, all the police, all the black caps of the
cardinal, will know your letter by heart, and you and your clever person
will be arrested."

"without reckoning," objected porthos, "that the queen would save
monsieur de buckingham, but would take no heed of us."

"gentlemen," said dâ€™artagnan, "what porthos says is full of sense."

"ah, ah! but whatâ€™s going on in the city yonder?" said athos.

"they are beating the general alarm."

the four friends listened, and the sound of the drum plainly reached
them.

"you see, they are going to send a whole regiment against us," said
athos.

"you donâ€™t think of holding out against a whole regiment, do you?" said
porthos.

"why

another so suitable. ah,
stop! i have it, gentlemen; the right idea has just occurred to me."

"tell us."

"allow me to give grimaud some indispensable orders."

athos made a sign for his lackey to approach.

"grimaud," said athos, pointing to the bodies which lay under the wall
of the bastion, "take those gentlemen, set them up against the wall, put
their hats upon their heads, and their guns in their hands."

"oh, the great man!" cried dâ€™artagnan. "i comprehend now."

"you comprehend?" said porthos.

"and do you comprehend, grimaud?" said aramis.

grimaud made a sign in the affirmative.

"thatâ€™s all that is necessary," said athos; "now for my idea."

"i should like, however, to comprehend," said porthos.

"that is useless."

"yes, yes! athosâ€™s idea!" cried aramis and dâ€™artagnan, at the same time.

"this milady, this woman, this creature, this demon, has a
brother-in-law, as i think you told me, dâ€™artagnan?"

"yes, i know him very well; and i also believe that he has not a very

better," replied athos.

"in that case we are as well off as we wish."

"and yet," said porthos, "i would like to know what grimaud is about."

"silence, porthos!" said aramis.

"what is her brother-in-lawâ€™s name?"

"lord de winter."

"where is he now?"

"he returned to london at the first sound of war."

"well, thereâ€™s just the man we want," said athos. "it is he whom we must
warn. we will have him informed that his sister-in-law is on the point
of having someone assassinated, and beg him not to lose sight of her.
there is in london, i hope, some establishment like that of the
magdalens, or of the repentant daughters. he must place his sister in

"yes," said dâ€™artagnan, "till she comes out."

"ah, my faith!" said athos, "you require too much, dâ€™artagnan. i have
given you all i have, and i beg leave to tell you that this is the
bottom of my sack."

"but i think it would be still better," said aramis, "to inform the
queen and lord de winter at the same time."

"yes; but who is to carry the letter to tours, and who to london?"

"i answer for bazin," said aramis.

"and i for planchet," said dâ€™artagnan.

"ay," said porthos, "if we cannot leave the camp, our lackeys may."

"to be sure they may; and this very day we will write the letters," said
aramis. "give the lackeys money, and they will start."

"we will give them money?" replied athos. "have you any money?"

the four friends looked at one another, and a cloud came over the brows
which but lately had been so cheerful.

"look out!" cried dâ€™artagnan, "i see black points and red points moving
yonder. why did you talk of a regiment, athos? it is a veritable army

"my faith, yes," said athos; "there they are. see the sneaks come,
without drum or trumpet. ah, ah! have you finished, grimaud?"

grimaud made a sign in the affirmative, and pointed to a dozen bodies
which he had set up in the most picturesque attitudes. some carried
arms, others seemed to be taking aim, and the remainder appeared merely
to be sword in hand.

"bravo!" said athos; "that does honor to your imagination."

"all very well," said porthos, "but i should like to understand."

"let us decamp first, and you will understand afterward."

"a moment, gentlemen, a moment; give grimaud time to clear away the
breakfast."

"ah, ah!" said aramis, "the black points and the red points are visibly
enlarging. i am of dâ€™artagnanâ€™s opinion; we have no time to lose in
regaining our camp."

"my faith," said athos, "i have nothing to say against a retreat. we bet
upon one hour, and we have stayed an hour and a half. nothing can be

returned with joy.

"come along, athos, come along!" cried dâ€™artagnan; "now we have found
everything except money, it would be stupid to be killed."

but athos continued to march majestically, whatever remarks his
companions made; and they, finding their remarks useless, regulated
their pace by his.

grimaud and his basket were far in advance, out of the range of the
balls.

at the end of an instant they heard a furious fusillade.

"whatâ€™s that?" asked porthos, "what are they firing at now? i hear no
balls whistle, and i see nobody!"

"they are firing at the corpses," replied athos.

"but the dead cannot return their fire."

"certainly not! they will then fancy it is an ambuscade, they will
deliberate; and by the time they have found out the pleasantry, we shall
be out of the range of their balls. that renders it useless to get a
pleurisy by too much haste."

"oh, i comprehend now," said the astonished porthos.

"thatâ€™s lucky," said athos, shruggin

"oh, itâ€™s nothing," said dâ€™artagnan.

"a spent ball?"

"not even that."

"what is it, then?"

we have said that athos loved dâ€™artagnan like a child, and this somber
and inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young man.

"only grazed a little," replied dâ€™artagnan; "my fingers were caught
between two stones--that of the wall and that of my ring--and the skin
was broken."

"that comes of wearing diamonds, my master," said athos, disdainfully.

"ah, to be sure," cried porthos, "there is a diamond. why the devil,
then, do we plague ourselves about money, when there is a diamond?"

"stop a bit!" said aramis.

"well thought of, porthos; this time you have an idea."

"undoubtedly," said porthos, drawing himself up at athosâ€™s compliment;
"as there is a diamond, let us sell it."

"but," said dâ€™artagnan, "it is the queenâ€™s diamond."

"the stronger reason why it should be sold," replied athos. "the queen
saving monsieur de buckingham, her lover; nothing more just. the

what says monsieur the abbe? i donâ€™t ask porthos; his opinion has been
given."

"why, i think," said aramis, blushing as usual, "that his ring not
coming from a mistress, and consequently not being a love token,
dâ€™artagnan may sell it."

"my dear aramis, you speak like theology personified. your advice, then,
is--"

"to sell the diamond," replied aramis.

"well, then," said dâ€™artagnan, gaily, "let us sell the diamond, and say
no more about it."

the fusillade continued; but the four friends were out of reach, and the
rochellais only fired

 to appease their consciences.

"my faith, it was time that idea came into porthosâ€™s head. here we are
at the camp; therefore, gentlemen, not a word more of this affair. we
are observed; they are coming to meet us. we shall be carried in
triumph."

in fact, as we have said, the whole camp was in motion. more than two
thousand persons had assisted, as at a spectacle, in this fortunate but
wild undertaking of the four friends--an undertaking of which they were
far from suspecting the real motive. nothing was heard but cries of

enthusiasm.

"well?" asked the cardinal, on seeing la houdiniere return.

"well, monseigneur," replied the latter, "three musketeers and a
guardsman laid a wager with monsieur de busigny that they would go and
breakfast in the bastion st. gervais; and while breakfasting they held
it for two hours against the enemy, and have killed i donâ€™t know how
many rochellais."

"did you inquire the names of those three musketeers?"

"yes, monseigneur."

"what are their names?"

"messieurs athos, porthos, and aramis."

"still my three brave fellows!" murmured the cardinal. "and the
guardsman?"

"dâ€™artagnan."

"still my young scapegrace. positively, these four men must be on my
side."

the same evening the cardinal spoke to m. de treville of the exploit of
the morning, which was the talk of the whole camp. m. de treville, who
had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes
of it, related it in all its details to his eminence, not forgetting the
episode of the napkin.

48 a family affair


athos had invented the phrase, family affair. a family affair was not
subject to the investigation of the cardinal; a family affair concerned
nobody. people might employ themselves in a family affair before all the
world. therefore athos had invented the phrase, family affair.

aramis had discovered the idea, the lackeys.

porthos had discovered the means, the diamond.

dâ€™artagnan alone had discovered nothing--he, ordinarily the most
inventive of the four; but it must be also said that the very name of
milady paralyzed him.

ah! no, we were mistaken; he had discovered a purchaser for his diamond.

the breakfast at m. de trevilleâ€™s was as gay and cheerful as possible.
dâ€™artagnan already wore his uniform--for being nearly of the same size
as aramis, and as aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who
purchased h

r plans.

dâ€™artagnan passed the day in exhibiting his musketeerâ€™s uniform in every
street of the camp.

in the evening, at the appointed hour, the four friends met. there only
remained three things to decide--what they should write to miladyâ€™s
brother; what they should write to the clever person at tours; and which
should be the lackeys to carry the letters.

everyone offered his own. athos talked of the discretion of grimaud, who
never spoke a word but when his master unlocked his mouth. porthos
boasted of the strength of mousqueton, who was big enough to thrash four
men of ordinary size. aramis, confiding in the address of bazin, made a
pompous eulogium on his candidate. finally, dâ€™artagnan had entire faith
in the bravery of planchet, and reminded them of the manner in which he
had conducted himself in the ticklish affair of boulogne.

these four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time, and gave
birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they

"the devil!" said dâ€™artagnan, "you are insupportable. if the letter must

"and you will do right. handle the musket and the sword, my dear fellow.
you will come off splendidly at those two exercises; but pass the pen
over to monsieur abbe. thatâ€™s his province."

"ay, ay!" said porthos; "pass the pen to aramis, who writes theses in
latin."

"well, so be it," said dâ€™artagnan. "draw up this note for us, aramis;
but by our holy father the pope, cut it short, for i shall prune you in
my turn, i warn you."

"i ask no better," said aramis, with that ingenious air of confidence
which every poet has in himself; "but let me be properly acquainted with
the subject. i have heard here and there that this sister-in-law was a
hussy. i have obtained proof of it by listening to her convers

the cardinal."

"lower! sacre bleu!" said athos.

"but," continued aramis, "the details escape me."

"and me also," said porthos.

dâ€™artagnan and athos looked at each other for some time in silence. at
length athos, after serious reflection and becoming more pale than
usual, made a sign of assent to dâ€™artagnan, who by it understood he was
at liberty to speak.

"well, this is what you have to say," said dâ€™artagnan: "my lord, your
sister-in-law is an infamous woman, who wished to have you killed that
she might inherit your wealth; but she could not marry your brother,
being already married in france, and having been-

as if seeking for the word, and looked at athos.

"repudiated by her husband," said athos.

"because she had been branded," continued dâ€™artagnan.

"bah!" cried porthos. "impossible! what do you say--that she wanted to
have her brother-in-law killed?"

"yes."

"she was married?" asked aramis.

"yes."

"and her husband found out that she had a fleur-de-lis on her shoulder?"
cried porthos.

"yes."

these three yeses had been pronounced by athos, each with a sadder
intonation.

"and who has seen this fleur-de-lis?" inquired aramis.

"dâ€™artagnan and i. or rather, to observe the chronological order, i and
dâ€™artagnan," replied athos.

"and does the husband of this frightful creature still live?" said
aramis.

"he still lives."

"are you quite sure of it?"

"i am he."

there was a moment of cold silence, during which everyone was affected
according to his nature.

with the letter, with an agreement that he shall have the other half in
exchange for the reply. have you the diamond?" continued athos.

"i have what is still better. i have the price;" and dâ€™artagnan threw
the bag upon the table. at the sound of the gold aramis raised his eyes
and porthos started. as to athos, he remained unmoved.

"how much in that little bag?"

"seven thousand livres, in louis of twelve francs."

"seven thousand livres!" cried porthos. "that poor little diamond was
worth seven thousand livres?"

"it appears so," said athos, "since here they are. i donâ€™t suppose that
our friend dâ€™artagnan has added any of his own to the amount."

"but, gentlemen, in all this," said dâ€™artagnan, "we do not think of the
queen. let us take some heed of the welfare of her dear

his own, "and be a good lad. remember, if you talk, if you babble, if
you get drunk, you risk your masterâ€™s head, who has so much confidence
in your fidelity, and who answers for you. but remember, also, that if
by your fault any evil happens to dâ€™artagnan, i will find you, wherever
you may be, for the purpose of ripping up your belly."

"oh, monsieur!" said planchet, humiliated by the suspicion, and
moreover, terrified at the calm air of the musketeer.

"and i," said porthos, rolling his large eyes, "remember, i will skin
you alive."

"ah, monsieur!"

"and i," said aramis, with his soft, melodius voice, "remember that i
will roast you at a slow fire, like a savage."

"ah, monsieur!"

planchet began to weep. we will not venture to say whether it was from
terror created by the threats or from tenderness at seeing four friends
so closely united.

dâ€™artagnan took his hand. "see, planchet," said he, "these gentlemen
only say this out of affection for me, but at bottom

"yez; whatâ€™s the dream?" said the swiss.

"well, pardieu!" said aramis, "it was only this: i had a dream, and i

"yez, yez," said the swiss; "itâ€™s simple enough to dell a dream, but i

"you are very fortunate," said athos, rising; "i wish i could say as
much!"

"neffer," replied the swiss, enchanted that a man like athos could envy
him anything. "neffer, neffer!"

dâ€™artagnan, seeing athos rise, did likewise, took his arm, and went out.

porthos and aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon
and the swiss.

as to bazin, he went and lay down on a truss of straw; and as he had
more imagination than the swiss, he dreamed that aramis, having become
pope, adorned his head with a cardinalâ€™s hat.

but, as we have said, bazin had not, by his fortunate return, removed
more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends.
the days of expectation are long, and dâ€™artagnan, in particular, would

necessary slowness of navigation; he exaggerated to himself the power of
milady. he credited this woman, who appeared to him the equal of a
demon, with agents as supernatural as herself; at the least noise, he
imagined himself about to be arrested, and that planchet was being
brought back to be confronted with himself and his friends. still
further, his confidence in the worthy picard, at one time so great,
diminished day by day. this anxiety became so great that it even
extended to aramis and porthos. athos alone remained unmoved, as if no
danger hovered over him, and as if he breathed his customary atmosphere.

on the sixteenth day, in particular, these signs were so strong in
dâ€™artagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one
place, and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which planchet was
expected.

"really," said athos to them, "you are not men but children, to let a
woman terrify you so! and what does it amount to, after all? to be
imprisoned. well, but we

"thatâ€™s all very well," replied dâ€™artagnan; "but i am tired of fearing
when i open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of
milady."

"you are very fastidious," said athos; "such a beautiful woman!"

"a woman of mark!" said porthos, with his loud laugh.

athos started, passed his hand over his brow to remove the drops of
perspiration that burst forth, and rose in his turn with a nervous
movement he could not repress.

the day, however, passed away; and the evening came on slowly, but
finally it came. the bars were filled with drinkers. athos, who had
pocketed his share of the diamond, seldom quit the parpaillot. he had
found in m. de busigny, who, by the by, had given them a magnificent
dinner, a partner worthy of his com

usual, when seven oâ€™clock sounded; the patrol was heard passing to
double the posts. at half past seven the retreat was sounded.

"we are lost," said dâ€™artagnan, in the ear of athos.

"you mean to say we have lost," said athos, quietly, drawing four
pistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the table. "come,
gentlemen," said he, "they are beating the tattoo. let us to bed!"

and athos went out of the parpaillot, followed by dâ€™artagnan. aramis
came behind, giving his arm to porthos. aramis mumbled verses to
himself, and porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his
mustache, in sign of despair.

but all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which
was familiar to dâ€™artagnan, and a well-known voice said, "monsieur, i
have brought your cloak; it is chilly this evening."

"planchet!" cried dâ€™artagnan, beside himself with joy.

"planchet!" repeated aramis and porthos.

"well, yes, planchet, to be sure," said athos, "what is there so

planchet.

"well!" cried dâ€™artagnan, "tell us all about it."

"dame, thatâ€™s a long job, monsieur."

"you are right, planchet," said athos; "besides, the tattoo has been
sounded, and we should be observed if we kept a light burning much
longer than the others."

"so be it," said dâ€™artagnan. "go to bed, planchet, and sleep soundly."

"my faith, monsieur! that will be the first time i have done so for
sixteen days."

"and me, too!" said dâ€™artagnan.

"and me, too!" said porthos.

"and me, too!" said aramis.

"well, if you will have the truth, and me, too!" said athos.




49 fatality


meantime milady, drunk with passion, roaring on the deck like a lioness
that has been embarked, had been tempted to throw herself into the sea
that she might regain the coast, for she could not get rid of the
thought that she had been insulted by dâ€™artagnan, threatened by athos,
and that she had quit france without being revenged on them. this idea
soon became so insupportable to her

 to stop, he alighted from his
horse, and went toward these suspected merry companions, hoping, by
means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge
which concealed his approach, to catch some words of this conversation
which appeared so interesting. at ten paces from the hedge he recognized
the talkative gascon; and as he had already perceived that these men
were musketeers, he did not doubt that the three others were those
called the inseparables; that is to say, athos, porthos, and aramis.

it may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was
augmented by this discovery. his eyes took a strange expression, and
with the step of a tiger-cat he advanced toward the hedge; but he had
not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any
positive sense, when a sonorous and short cry made him start, and
attracted the attention of the musketeers.

"officer!" cried grimaud.

"you are speaking, you scoundrel!" said athos, rising upon his elbow,

the four young men, standing and motionless, followed him with their
eyes without speaking a single word until he had disappeared. then they
looked at one another.

the countenances of all gave evidence of terror, for notwithstanding the
friendly adieu of his eminence, they plainly perceived that the cardinal
went away with rage in his heart.

athos alone smiled, with a self-possessed, disdainful smile.

when the cardinal was out of hearing and sight, "that grimaud kept bad
watch!" cried porthos, who had a great inclination to vent his ill-humor
on somebody.

grimaud was about to reply to excuse himself. athos lifted his finger,
and grimaud was silent.

"would you have given up the letter, aramis?" said dâ€™artagnan.

"i," said aramis, in his most flutelike tone, "i had made up my mind. if
he had insisted upon the letter being given up to him, i would have
presented the letter to him with one hand, and with the other i would
have run my sword through his body."

"i expected as much," s

"oh, what do i not owe you, aramis?" said dâ€™artagnan. "dear constance! i
have at length, then, intelligence of you. she lives; she is in safety
in a convent; she is at bethune! where is bethune, athos?"

"why, upon the frontiers of artois and of flanders. the siege once over,
we shall be able to make a tour in that direction."

"and that will not be long, it is to be hoped," said porthos; "for they
have this morning hanged a spy who confessed that the rochellais were
reduced to the leather of their shoes. supposing that after having eaten
the leather they eat the soles, i cannot see much that is left unless
they eat one another."

"poor fools!" said athos, emptying a glass of excellent bordeaux wine
which, without having at that period the reputation it now enjoys,
merited it no less, "poor fools! as if the catholic religion was not the

"they are brave fellows! but what the devil are you about, aramis?"
continued athos. "why, you are squeezing that letter into your pocket!"

"yes," said dâ€™artagnan, "athos is right, it must be burned. and yet if
we burn it, who knows whether monsieur cardinal has not a secret to
interrogate ashes?"

"he must have one," said athos.

"what will you do with the letter, then?" asked porthos.

"come here, grimaud," said athos. grimaud rose and obeyed. "as a
punishment for having spoken without permission, my friend, you will
please to eat this piece of paper; then to recompense you for the
service you will have rendered us, you shall afterward drink this glass
of wine. first, here is the letter. eat heartily."

grimaud smiled; and with his eyes fixed upon the glass which athos held

swallowed it.

it may be easily imagined how the relationship between aramis and a
seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men; but
aramis, after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his
eyes at the gross pleasantry of porthos, begged his friends not to
revert to the subject again, declaring that if a single word more was
said to him about it, he would never again implore his cousins to
interfere in such affairs.

there was no further question, therefore, about marie michon among the
four musketeers, who besides had what they wanted: that was, the order
to withdraw mme. bonacieux from the convent of the carmelites of
bethune. it was true that this order would not be of great use to them

possible--for he was anxious to be in paris by the twenty-third--stopped
from time to time to fly the magpie, a pastime for which the taste had
been formerly inspired in him by de luynes, and for which he had always
preserved a great predilection. out of the twenty musketeers sixteen,
when this took place, rejoiced greatly at this relaxation; but the other
four cursed it heartily. dâ€™artagnan, in particular, had a perpetual
buzzing in his ears, which porthos explained thus: "a very great lady
has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you somewhere."

at length the escort passed through paris on the twenty-third, in the
night. the king thanked m. de treville, and permitted him to distribute
furloughs for four days, on condition that the favored parties should
not appear in any public place, under penalty of the bastille.

the first four furloughs granted, as may be imagined, were to our four
friends. still further, athos obtained of m.

to this athos replied quietly: "we also have money left--for i have not
yet drunk all my share of the diamond, and porthos and aramis have not
eaten all theirs. we can therefore use up four horses as well as one.
but consider, dâ€™artagnan," added he, in a tone so solemn that it made
the young man shudder, "consider that bethune is a city where the
cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who, wherever she goes, brings
misery with her. if you had only to deal with four men, dâ€™artagnan, i
would allow you to go alone. you have to do with that woman! we four

the yard. dâ€™artagnan unfolded the paper.

"well?" eagerly demanded all his three friends.

"nothing but one word!" said dâ€™artagnan.

"yes," said aramis, "but that one word is the name of some town or
village."

"armentieres," read porthos; "armentieres? i donâ€™t know such a place."

"and that name of a town or village is written in her hand!" cried
athos.

"come on, come on!" said dâ€™artagnan; "let us keep that paper carefully,
perhaps i have not thrown away my half-pistole. to horse, my friends, to

and the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to bethune.

from madame the constable, and which she has had the imprudence to show
me, leads me to believe that these four men, on the contrary, are on the
road hither to take her away."

"the devil! whatâ€™s to be done?"

"what did the cardinal say about me?"

"i was to take your dispatches,

 said rochefort, taking the paper from milady, folding it, and
placing it in the lining of his hat, "you may be easy. i will do as
children do, for fear of losing the paper--repeat the name along the
route. now, is that all?"

"i believe so."

"let us see: buckingham dead or grievously wounded; your conversation
with the cardinal overheard by the four musketeers; lord de winter
warned of your arrival at portsmouth; dâ€™artagnan and athos to the
bastille; aramis the lover of madame de chevreuse; porthos an ass;
madame bonacieux found again; to send you the chaise as soon as
possible; to place my lackey at your disposal; to make you out a victim
of the cardinal in order that the abbess may entertain no suspicion;
armentieres, on the banks of the lys. is that all, then?"

"in truth, my dear chevalier, you are a miracle of memory. a propos, add
one thing--"

"what?"

"i saw some very pretty woods which almost touch the convent garden. say
that i am permitted to walk in those woods. who knows? per

"dâ€™artagnan! dâ€™artagnan!" cried she, "is it you? this way! this way!"

"constance? constance?" replied the young man, "where are you? where are
you? my god!"

at the same moment the door of the cell yielded to a shock, rather than
opened; several men rushed into the chamber. mme. bonacieux had sunk
into an armchair, without the power of moving.

dâ€™artagnan threw down a yet-smoking pistol which he held in his hand,
and fell on his knees before his mistress. athos replaced his in his
belt; porthos and aramis, who held their drawn swords in their hands,
returned them to their scabbards.

"oh, dâ€™artagnan, my beloved dâ€™artagnan! you have come, then, at last!
you have not deceived me! it is indeed thee!"

"yes, yes, constance. reunited!"

"oh, it was in vain she told me you would not come! i hoped in silence.
i was not willing to fly. oh, i have done well! how happy i am!"

at this word she, athos, who had seated himself quietly, started up.

"she! what she?" asked dâ€™artagnan.

"why, m

nion are you speaking, dear
constance?"

"of her whose carriage was at the gate; of a woman who calls herself
your friend; of a woman to whom you have told everything."

"her name, her name!" cried dâ€™artagnan. "my god, can you not remember
her name?"

"yes, it was pronounced in my hearing once. stop--but--it is very
strange--oh, my god, my head swims! i cannot see!"

"help, help, my friends! her hands are icy cold," cried dâ€™artagnan. "she
is ill! great god, she is losing her senses!"

while porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong
voice, aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water; but he stopped
at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the
countenance of athos, who, standing before the table, his hair rising
from his head, his eyes fixed in stupor, was looking at one of the
glasses, and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt.

"oh!" said athos, "oh, no, it is impossible! god would not permit such a
crime!"

"water, water!" cried dâ€™artagnan.

 "madame, in the name of heaven, whose empty glass
is this?"

"mine, monsieur," said the young woman, in a dying voice.

"but who poured the wine for you that was in this glass?"

"she."

"but who is she?"

"oh, i remember!" said mme. bonacieux, "the comtesse de winter."

the four friends uttered one and the same cry, but that of athos
dominated all the rest.

at that moment the countenance of mme. bonacieux became livid; a fearful
agony pervaded her frame, and she sank panting into the arms of porthos
and aramis.

dâ€™artagnan seized the hands of athos with an anguish difficult to be
described.

"and what do you believe?â€™ his voice was stifled by sobs.

"i believe everything," said athos, biting his lips till the blood
sprang to avoid sighing.

"dâ€™artagnan, dâ€™artagnan!" cried mme. bonacieux, "where art thou? do not
leave me! you see i am dying!"

dâ€™artagnan released the hands of athos which he still held clasped in
both his own, and hastened to her. her beautiful face was distorted w

agony; her glassy eyes had no longer their sight; a convulsive
shuddering shook her whole body; the sweat rolled from her brow.

"in the name of heaven, run, call! aramis! porthos! call for help!"

"useless!" said athos, "useless! for the poison which she pours there is
no antidote."

"yes, yes! help, help!" murmured mme. bonacieux; "help!"

then, collecting all her strength, she took the head of the young man
between her hands, looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul
passed into that look, and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to his.

"constance, constance!" cried dâ€™artagnan.

a sigh escaped from the mouth of mme. bonacieux, and dwelt for an
instant on th
 
 ___________________________
 
e lips of dâ€™artagnan. that sigh was the soul, so chaste and
so loving, which reascended to heaven.

dâ€™artagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms. the young man
uttered a cry, and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy
as herself.

porthos wept; aramis pointed toward heaven; athos made the sign of the
cross.

at that moment a man appeared in the doorway, almost as pale as those in
the chamber. he looked around him and saw mme. bonacieux dead, and
dâ€™artagnan in a swoon. he appeared just at that moment of stupor which
follows great catastrophes.

"i was not deceived," said he; "here is monsieur dâ€™artagnan; and you are
his friends, messieurs athos, porthos, and aramis."

the persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the

minutes at st. omer. finally, at lilliers i lost all trace of her. i was
going about at random, inquiring of everybody, when i saw you gallop
past. i recognized monsieur dâ€™artagnan. i called to you, but you did not
answer me; i wished to follow you, but my horse was too much fatigued to
go at the same pace with yours. and yet it appears, in spite of all your
diligence, you have arrived too late."

"you see!" said athos, pointing to mme. bonacieux dead, and to
dâ€™artagnan, whom porthos and aramis were trying to recall to life.

"are they both dead?" asked lord de winter, sternly.

"no," replied athos, "fortunately monsieur dâ€™artagnan has only fainted."

"ah, indeed, so much the better!" said lord de winter.

at that moment dâ€™artagnan opened his eyes. he tore himself from the arms
of porthos and aramis, and threw himself like a madman on the corpse of
his mistress.

athos rose, walked toward his friend with a slow and solemn step,
embraced him tenderly, and as he burst int

o violent sobs, he said to him
with his noble and persuasive voice, "friend, be a man! women weep for
the dead; men avenge them!"

"oh, yes!" cried dâ€™artagnan, "yes! if it be to avenge her, i am ready to
follow you."

athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance
restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to porthos and aramis
to go and fetch the superior.

the two friends met her in the corridor, greatly troubled and much upset
by such strange events; she called some of the nuns, who against all
monastic custom found themselves in the presence of five men.

"madame," said athos, passing his arm under that of dâ€™artagnan, "we
abandon to your pious care the body of that unfortunate woman. she was
an angel on earth before being an angel in heaven. treat her as one of
your sisters. we will return someday to

ook their way
to the town of bethune, whose outskirts they perceived, and stopped
before the first inn they came to.

"but," said dâ€™artagnan, "shall we not pursue that woman?"

"later," said athos. "i have measures to take."

"she will escape us," replied the young man; "she will escape us, and it
will be your fault, athos."

"i will be accountable for her," said athos.

dâ€™artagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he
lowered his head, and entered the inn without reply.

porthos and aramis regarded each other, not understanding this assurance
of athos.

lord de winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of
dâ€™artagnan.

"now, gentlemen," said athos, when he had ascertained there were five
chambers free in the hotel, "let everyone retire to his own apartment.
dâ€™artagnan needs to be alone, to weep and to sleep. i take charge of
everything; be easy."

"it appears, however," said lord de winter, "if there are any measures
to take against the countess, i

t concerns me; she is my sister-in-law."

"and me," said athos, "--she is my wife!"

dâ€™artagnan smiled--for he understood that athos was sure of his
vengeance when he revealed such a secret. porthos and aramis looked at
each other, and grew pale. lord de winter thought athos was mad.

"now, retire to your chambers," said athos, "and leave me to act. you
must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns me. only,
dâ€™artagnan, if you have not lost it, give me the paper which fell from
that manâ€™s hat, upon which is written the name of the village of--"

"ah," said dâ€™artagnan, "i comprehend! that name written in her hand."

"you see, then," said athos, "there is a god in heaven

sh extinct, all remained in darkness.

every minute athos was forced to restrain dâ€™artagnan, constantly in
advance of the little troop, and to beg him to keep in the line, which
in an instant he again departed from. he had but one thought--to go
forward; and he went.

they passed in silence through the little village of festubert, where
the wounded servant was, and then skirted the wood of richebourg. at
herlier, planchet, who led the column, turned to the left.

several times lord de winter, porthos, or aramis tried to talk with the
man in the red cloak; but to every interrogation which they put to him
he bowed, without response. the travelers then comprehended that there
must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence, and ceased
to address themselves to him.

the storm increased, the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly, the
thunder began to growl, and the wind, the precursor of a hurricane,
whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen.

the cavalcade trotted on

threshold.

milady recoiled, uttering a cry. dâ€™artagnan, believing she might have
means of flight and fearing she should escape, drew a pistol from his
belt; but athos raised his hand.

"put back that weapon, dâ€™artagnan!" said he; "this woman must be tried,
not assassinated. wait an instant, my friend, and you shall be
satisfied. come in, gentlemen."

dâ€™artagnan obeyed; for athos had the solemn voice and the powerful
gesture of a judge sent by the lord himself. behind dâ€™artagnan entered
porthos, aramis, lord de winter, and the man in the red cloak.

the four lackeys guarded the door and the window.

milady had sunk into a chair, with her hands extended, as if to conjure
this terrible apparition. perceiving her brother-in-law, she uttered a
terrible cry.

"what do you want?" screamed milady.

"we want," said athos, "charlotte backson, who first was called comtesse
de la fere, and afterwards milady de winter, baroness of sheffield."

"that is i! that is i!" murmured milady, in extreme t
 
 ___________________________
 
error; "what do you
want?"

"we wish to judge you according to your crime," said athos; "you shall
be free to defend yourself. justify yourself if you can. m. dâ€™artagnan,
it is for you to accuse her first."

dâ€™artagnan advanced.

"before god and before men," said he, "i accuse this woman of having
poisoned constance bonacieux, who died yesterday evening."

he turned towards porthos and aramis.

"we bear witness to this," said the two musketeers, with one voice.

dâ€™artagnan continued: "before god and before men, i accuse this woman of
having attempted to poison me, in wine which she sent me from villeroy,
with a forged letter, as if that wine came from my friends. god
preserved me, but a man named brisemont died in my place."

"we bear witness to this," said porthos and aramis, in the same manner
as before.

"before god and before men, i accuse this woman of having urged
 
 ___________________________
 
 me to
the murder of the baron de wardes; but as no one else can attest the
truth of this accusation, i attest it myself. i have done." and
dâ€™artagnan passed to the other side of the room with porthos and aramis.

"your turn, my lord," said athos.

the baron came forward.

"before god and before men," said he, "i accuse this woman of having
caused the assassination of the duke of buckingham."

"the duke of buckingham assassinated!" cried all present, with one
voice.

"yes," said the baron, "assassinated. on receiving the warning letter
you wrote to me, i had this woman arrested, and gave her in charge to a
loyal servant. she corrupted this man; she placed the poniard in his
hand; she made hi

m kill the duke. and at this moment, perhaps, felton is
paying with his head for the crime of this fury!"

a shudder crept through the judges at the revelation of these unknown
crimes.

"that is not all," resumed lord de winter. "my brother, who made you his
heir, died in three hours of a strange disorder which left livid traces
all over the body. my sister, how did your husband die?"

"horror!" cried porthos and aramis.

"assassin of buckingham, assassin of felton, assassin of my brother, i
demand justice upon you, and i swear that if it be not granted to me, i
will execute it myself."

and lord de winter ranged himself by the side of dâ€™artagnan, leaving the
place free for another accuser.

milady let her head sink between her two hands, and tried to recall her
ideas, whirling in a mortal vertigo.

"my turn," said athos, himself trembling as the lion trembles at the
sight of the serpent--"my turn

o had condemned me, they kept their word. as
soon as the identity of my brother was proved, i was set at liberty.

"that is the crime of which i accuse her; that is the cause for which
she was branded."

"monsieur dâ€™artagnan," said athos, "what is the penalty you demand
against this woman?"

"the punishment of death," replied dâ€™artagnan.

"my lord de winter," continued athos, "what is the penalty you demand
against this woman?"

"the punishment of death," replied lord de winter.

"messieurs porthos and aramis," repeated athos, "you who are her judges,
what is the sentence you pronounce upon this woman?"

"the punishment of death," replied the musketeers, in a hollow voice.

milady uttered a frightful shriek, and dragged herself along several
paces upon her knees toward her judges.

athos stretched out his hand toward her.

"charlotte backson, comtesse de la fere, milady de winter," said he,
"your crimes have wearied men on earth and god in heaven. if you know a
prayer, say it--for you are
 
 ___________________________
 
 condemned, and you shall die."

at these words, which left no hope, milady raised herself in all her
pride, and wished to speak; but her strength failed her. she felt that a
powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair, and dragged her
away as irrevocably as fatality drags humanity. she did not, therefore,
even attempt the least resistance, and went out of the cottage.

lord de winter, dâ€™artagnan, athos, porthos, and aramis, went out close
behind her. the lackeys followed their masters, and the chamber was left
solitary, with its broken window, its open door, and its smoky lamp
burning sadly on the table.




66 execution


it was near midnight; the moon, lessened by its decline, and reddened by
the last traces of the storm, arose behind the little town of
armentieres, which showed against its pale light the dark outline of its
houses, and the skeleton of its high belfry. in front of them the lys

d like a serpent over the black mass of trees, and
like a terrible scimitar divided the heavens and the waters into two
parts. not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere. a
deathlike silence oppressed all nature. the soil was humid and
glittering with the rain which had recently fallen, and the refreshed
herbs sent forth their perfume with additional energy.

two lackeys dragged milady, whom each held by one arm. the executioner
walked behind them, and lord de winter, dâ€™artagnan, porthos, and aramis
walked behind the executioner. planchet and bazin came last.

the two lackeys conducted milady to the bank of the river. her mouth was
mute; but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence,
supplicating by turns each of those on whom she looked.

being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys, "a thousand
pistoles to each of you, if you will assist my escape; but if you
deliver me up to your masters, i have near at hand avengers who will
make you pay dearly for my d

eturning to his eminence, monsieur the chevalier," said athos,
advancing; "and you will please to accept the word of monsieur
dâ€™artagnan that he will go straight to la rochelle."

"i must place him in the hands of guards who will take him into camp."

"we will be his guards, monsieur, upon our word as gentlemen; but
likewise, upon our word as gentlemen," added athos, knitting his brow,
"monsieur dâ€™artagnan shall not leave us."

the chevalier de rochefort cast a glance backward, and saw that porthos
and aramis had placed themselves between him and the gate; he understood
that he was completely at the mercy of these four men.

"gentlemen," said he, "if monsieur dâ€™artagnan will surrender his sword
to me and join his word to yours, i shall be satisfied with your promise
to convey monsieur dâ€™artagnan to the quarters of monseigneur the
cardinal."

"you have my word, monsieur, and here is my sword."

"this suits me the better," said rochefort, "as i wish to continue my
journey."

"if it is f

dâ€™artagnan related what had taken place between the cardinal and
himself, and drawing the commission from his pocket, said, "here, my
dear athos, this naturally belongs to you."

athos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive smiles.

"friend," said he, "for athos this is too much; for the comte de la fere
it is too little. keep the commission; it is yours. alas! you have
purchased it dearly enough."

dâ€™artagnan left athosâ€™s chamber and went to that of porthos. he found
him clothed in a magnificent dress covered with splendid embroidery,
admiring himself before a glass.

"ah, ah! is that you, dear friend?" exclaimed porthos. "how do you think
these garments fit me?"

"wonderfully," said dâ€™artagnan; "but i come to offer you a dress which
will become you still better."

"what?" asked porthos.

"that of a lieutenant of musketeers."

dâ€™artagnan related to porthos the substance of his interview with the
cardinal, and said, taking the commission from h

is pocket, "here, my
friend, write your name upon it and become my chief."

porthos cast his eyes over the commission and returned it to dâ€™artagnan,
to the great astonishment of the young man.

"yes," said he, "yes, that would flatter me very much; but i should not
have time enough to enjoy the distinction. during our expedition to
bethune the husband of my duchess died; so, my dear, the coffer of the
defunct holding out its arms to me, i shall marry the widow. look here!
i was trying on my wedding suit. keep the lieutenancy, my dear, keep

la rochelle, deprived of the assistance of the english fleet and of the
diversion promised by buckingham, surrendered after a siege of a year.
on the twenty-eighth of october, 1628, the capitulation was signed.

the king made his entrance into paris on the twenty-third of december of
the same year. he was received in triumph, as if he came from conquering
an enemy and not frenchmen. he entered by the faubourg st. jacques,
under verdant arches.

dâ€™artagnan took possession of his command. porthos left the service, and
in the course of the following year married mme. coquenard; the coffer
so much coveted contained eight hundred thousand livres.

mousqueton had a magnificent livery, and enjoyed the satisfaction of
which he had been ambitious all his life--that of standing behind a
gilded carriage.

aramis, after a journey into lorraine, disappeared all at once, and
ceased to write to his friends; they learned at a later period through
mme. de chevreuse, who told it to two or three of her
