Chief Prison Guard - 
                Played
by Michael Bates
                Sports a small, Hitlerian
mustache and walks and talks in a military style. The chief prison
guard's manner is so extreme that he becomes a humorous caricature
of a prison guard, shouting short commands at Alex like "Shut your
filthy hole, you scum."
