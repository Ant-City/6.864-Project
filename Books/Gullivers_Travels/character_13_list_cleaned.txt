[CHARACTER] - 
                absentminded
intellectuals who live on the floating island of laputa, encountered
by gulliver on his third voyage. the [CHARACTER] are parodies of theoreticians, who
have scant regard for any practical results of their own research.
they are so inwardly absorbed in their own thoughts that they must
be shaken out of their meditations by special servants called flappers,
who shake rattles in their ears. during gulliver's stay among them,
they do not mistreat him, but are generally unpleasant and dismiss
him as intellectually deficient. they do not care about down-to-earth
things like the dilapidation of their own houses, but worry intensely about
abstract matters like the trajectories of comets and the course
of the sun. they are dependent in their own material needs on the
land below them, called lagado, above which they hover by virtue
of a magnetic field, and from which they periodically raise up food
supplies. in the larger context of gulliver's journeys, the [CHARACTER]
are a parody of the excesses of theoretical pursuits and the uselessness
of purely abstract knowledge.
