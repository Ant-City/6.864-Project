[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER], the enlightened ferryman, is the guide who finally
leads siddhartha to enlightenment. siddhartha first meets [CHARACTER]
after leaving gotama and govinda and immediately notices [CHARACTER]'s serenity.
although [CHARACTER] lives within this world, his presence seems to
transcend it, and all who meet him feel his divine, enlightened
energy. he does not boast about his power or wisdom but simply credits
all knowledge he has to the river. his primary action, other than
ferrying passengers across the river, seems to be listening to whatever
wisdom the river imparts to him. he is such a powerful figure that
when a desperate, suicidal siddhartha, convinced he'll never reach
enlightenment, encounters [CHARACTER] a second time, he asks to become
[CHARACTER]'s apprentice. in a way, siddhartha relies on [CHARACTER] to
save his life.

	[CHARACTER] does not teach siddhartha a complicated philosophical belief
system, only that he should learn from the river and allow it to explain
its wisdom. throughout siddhartha's spiritual progression, [CHARACTER]
keeps him moving in the right direction by prompting him to listen
to the river whenever he has questions or doubts. in a bittersweet
ending to their time together, siddhartha's achievement of nirvana
coincides with the end of [CHARACTER]'s time on the river and on earth.
[CHARACTER], who has literally and figuratively ferried siddhartha
to enlightenment, can now leave the earth, with siddhartha taking
over as ferryman. [CHARACTER] will live on in siddhartha's own enlightenment
and teachings. 
[CHARACTER] is a name for krishna, an incarnation of vishnu,
one of the powerful gods in a hindu trinity, and means "he who lives
in all thoughts, and who lives in all people." he is the most godlike
figure within the book, yet he acts with surprising humility.
