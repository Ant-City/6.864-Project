     all things that move between the quiet poles
     shall be at my command:  emperors and kings
     are but obeyed in their several provinces,
     nor can they raise the wind, or rend the clouds;
     but his dominion that exceeds in this,
     stretcheth as far as doth the mind of man;
     a sound magician is a mighty god:
     here, faustus, tire[21] thy brains to gain a deity.

     wagner, commend me to my dearest friends,
     the german valdes and cornelius;
     request them earnestly to visit me.

     wagner. i will, sir.

     faustus. their conference will be a greater help to me
     than all my labours, plod i ne'er so fast.

          enter good angel and evil angel.

     good angel. o, faustus, lay that damned book aside,
     and gaze not on it, lest it tempt thy soul,
     and heap god's heavy wrath upon thy head!
     read, read the scriptures:--that is blasphemy.

     evil angel. go forward, faustus
