[CHARACTER]
steerforth is a slick, egotistical, wealthy young man
whose sense of self-importance overwhelms all his opinions. steerforth
underscores the difference between what we understand as readers
and what david sees--and fails to see--in his youthful naivete. david takes
steerforth's kindness for granted without analyzing his motives
or detecting his duplicity. when steerforth befriends david at salem
house, david doesn't suspect that steerforth is simply trying to
use david to make friends and gain status. though steerforth belittles
david from the moment they meet, david is incapable of conceiving
that his new friend might be taking advantage of him. because steerforth's
duplicity is so clear to us, david's lack of insight into steerforth's
true intentions emphasizes his youthful innocence. steerforth likes
david only because david worships him, and his final betrayal comes
as a surprise to david but not to us.
