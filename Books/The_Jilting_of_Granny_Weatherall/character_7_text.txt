stures 
tossed around her and over her head saying, “don’t cross her, let her have her way, 
she’s eighty years old,” and sitting there as if she lived in a thin glass cage. sometimes 
granny almost made up her mind to pack up and move back to her own house where 
nobody could remind her every minute that she was old. wait, wait, cornelia, till your 
own children whisper behind your back! 

in her day she had kept a better house and had got more work done. she wasn’t 

too old yet for lydia to be driving eighty miles for advice when one of the children 
jumped the track, and jimmy still dropped in and talked things over: “now, mammy, 
you’ve a good business head, i want to know what you think of this?…” old cornelia 
couldn’t change the furniture around without asking. little things, little things! they 
had been so sweet when they were little. granny wished the old days were back again 
with the children young and everything to be done over. it had been a hard pull, but

n’t you? then stand 
up to it. her eyelids wavered and let in streamers of blue-gray light like tissue paper 
over her eyes. she must get up and pull the shades down or she’d never sleep. she was 
in bed again and the shades were not down. how could that happen? better turn over, 
hide from the light, sleeping in the light gave you nightmares. “mother, how do you 
feel now?” and a stinging wetness on her forehead. but i don’t like having my face 
washed in cold water! 

hapsy? george? lydia? jimmy? no, cornelia, and her features were swollen and 
full of little puddles. “they’re coming, darling, they’ll all be here soon.” go wash your 
face, child, you look funny. 

instead of obeying, cornelia knelt down and put her head on the pillow. she 

seemed to be talking but there was no sound. 

“well, are you tongue-tied? whose birthday is it? are you going to give a party?” 

cornelia’s mouth moved urgently in strange shapes. “don’t do that, you bother 

me, daughter.

husband for anybody except st. michael himself, and you may tell him that for me with 
a thank you in the bargain. 

light flashed on her closed eyelids, and a deep roaring shook her. cornelia, is that 

lightning? i hear thunder. there’s going to be a storm. close all the windows. call the 
children in... “mother, where we are, all of us.” “is that you, hapsy?” “oh, no, i’m 
lydia. we drove as fast as we could.” their faces drifted above her, drifted away. the 
rosary fell out of her hands and lydia put it back. jimmy tried to help, their hands 
fumbled together, and granny closed two fingers around jimmy’s thumb. beads 
wouldn’t do it, it must be something alive. she was so amazed her thoughts ran round 
and round. so, my dear lord, this is my death and i wasn’t even thinking about it. my 
children have come to see me die. but i can’t, it’s not time. oh, i a

surprises. i wanted to give cornelia the amethyst set – cornelia, you’re to have the 
amethyst set, but hapsy’ to wear it when she wants, and, doctor harry, do shut up. 
nobody sent for you. oh, my dear lord, do wait a minute. i meant to do something 
about the forty acres, jimmy doesn’t need it and lydia will later on, with that 
worthless husband of hers. i meant to finish the altar cloth and send six bottles of wine 
to sister borgia for her dyspepsia. i want to send six bottles of wine to sister borgia, 
father connolly, now don’t let me forget. 
cornelia’s voice made short turns and tilted over and crashed. “oh, mother, oh, 
mother, oh, mother…” 

“i’m not going cornelia. i’m taken by surprise. i can’t go.” 

you’ll see hapsy again. what about her? “i thought you’d
