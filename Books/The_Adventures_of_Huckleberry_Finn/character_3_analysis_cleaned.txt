[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER], huck's companion as he travels down the river, is
a man of remarkable intelligence and compassion. at first glance,
[CHARACTER] seems to be superstitious to the point of idiocy, but a careful
reading of the time that huck and [CHARACTER] spend on jackson's island
reveals that [CHARACTER]'s superstitions conceal a deep knowledge of the
natural world and represent an alternate form of "truth" or intelligence.
moreover, [CHARACTER] has one of the few healthy, functioning families in
the novel. although he has been separated from his wife and children,
he misses them terribly, and it is only the thought of a permanent
separation from them that motivates his criminal act of running
away from miss watson. on the river, [CHARACTER] becomes a surrogate father,
as well as a friend, to huck, taking care of him without being intrusive or
smothering. he cooks for the boy and shelters him from some of the
worst horrors that they encounter, including the sight of pap's corpse,
and, for a time, the news of his father's passing.
some readers have criticized [CHARACTER] as being too passive,
but it is important to remember that he remains at the mercy of
every other character in this novel, including even the poor, thirteen-year-old huck,
as the letter that huck nearly sends to miss watson demonstrates.
like huck, [CHARACTER] is realistic about his situation and must find ways
of accomplishing his goals without incurring the wrath of those
who could turn him in. in this position, he is seldom able to act boldly
or speak his mind. nonetheless, despite these restrictions and constant
fear, [CHARACTER] consistently acts as a noble human being and a loyal friend.
in fact, [CHARACTER] could be described as the only real adult in the novel,
and the only one who provides a positive, respectable example for
huck to follow.
