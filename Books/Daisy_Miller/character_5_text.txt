y bold, thought it possible she was offended. “with your mother,” he answered very respectfully.
but it seemed that both his audacity and his respect were lost upon miss daisy miller. “i guess my mother won’t go, after all,” she said. “she don’t like to ride round in the afternoon. but did you really mean what you said just now—that you would like to go up there?”
“most earnestly,” winterbourne declared.
“then we may arrange it. if mother will stay with randolph, i guess eugenio will.”
“eugenio?” the young man inquired.
“eugenio’s our courier. he doesn’t like to stay with randolph; he’s the most fastidious man i ever saw. but he’s a splendid courier. i guess he’ll stay at home with randolph if mother does, and then we can go to the castle.”
winterbourne reflected for an instant as lucidly as possible—“we” could only mean miss daisy miller and himself. this program seemed almost too agreeable for credence; he felt as if he ought to kiss the you

ng lady’s hand. possibly he would have done so and quite spoiled the project, but at this moment another person, presumably eugenio, appeared. a tall, handsome man, with superb whiskers, wearing a velvet morning coat and a brilliant watch chain, approached miss miller, looking sharply at her companion. “oh, eugenio!” said miss miller with the friendliest accent.
eugenio had looked at winterbourne from head to foot; he now bowed gravely to the young lady. “i have the honor to inform mademoiselle that luncheon is upon the table.”
miss miller slowly rose. “see here, eugenio!” she said; “i’m going to that old castle, anyway.”
“to the chateau de chillon, mademoiselle?” the courier inquired. “mademoiselle has made arrangements?” he added in a tone which struck winterbourne as very impertinent.
eugenio’s tone apparently threw, even to miss mil

can?”
the courier stood looking at winterbourne offensively. the young man, at least, thought his manner of looking an offense to miss miller; it conveyed an imputation that she “picked up” acquaintances. “i shall have the honor of presenting to you a person who will tell you all about me,” he said, smiling and referring to his aunt.
“oh, well, we’ll go some day,” said miss miller. and she gave him a smile and turned away. she put up her parasol and walked back to the inn beside eugenio. winterbourne stood looking after her; and as she moved away, drawing her muslin furbelows over the gravel, said to himself that she had the tournure of a princess.
he had, however, engaged to do more than proved feasible, in promising to present his aunt, mrs. costello, to miss daisy miller. as soon as the former lady had got better of her headache, he waited upon her in her apartment; and, after the proper inquiries in regard to her health, he asked her if she had observed in the hotel an ame

id the young girl. “she doesn’t sleep—not three hours. she says she doesn’t know how she lives. she’s dreadfully nervous. i guess she sleeps more than she thinks. she’s gone somewhere after randolph; she wants to try to get him to go to bed. he doesn’t like to go to bed.”
“let us hope she will persuade him,” observed winterbourne.
“she will talk to him all she can; but he doesn’t like her to talk to him,” said miss daisy, opening her fan. “she’s going to try to get eugenio to talk to him. but he isn’t afraid of eugenio. eugenio’s a splendid courier, but he can’t make much impression on randolph! i don’t believe he’ll go to bed before eleven.” it appeared that randolph’s vigil was in fact triumphantly prolonged, for winterbourne strolled about with the young girl for some time without meeting her mother. “i have been looking round for that lady you want to introduce me to,” his companion resumed. “she’s your aunt.” then, on winterbourne’s

“it will be still more lovely to do it.”
“yes, it would be lovely!” said daisy. but she made no movement to accompany him; she only stood there laughing.
“i should think you had better find out what time it is,” interposed her mother.
“it is eleven o’clock, madam,” said a voice, with a foreign accent, out of the neighboring darkness; and winterbourne, turning, perceived the florid personage who was in attendance upon the two ladies. he had apparently just approached.
“oh, eugenio,” said daisy, “i am going out in a boat!”
eugenio bowed. “at eleven o’clock, mademoiselle?”
“i am going with mr. winterbourne—this very minute.”
“do tell her she can’t,” said mrs. miller to the courier.
“i think you had better not go out in a boat, mademoiselle,” eugenio declared.
winterbourne wished to heaven this pretty girl were not so familiar with her courier; but he said nothing.
“i suppose you don’t think it’s proper!” daisy exclaimed. “eugenio doesn

’t think anything’s proper.”
“i am at your service,” said winterbourne.
“does mademoiselle propose to go alone?” asked eugenio of mrs. miller.
“oh, no; with this gentleman!” answered daisy’s mamma.
the courier looked for a moment at winterbourne—the latter thought he was smiling—and then, solemnly, with a bow, “as mademoiselle pleases!” he said.
“oh, i hoped you would make a fuss!” said daisy. “i don’t care to go now.”
“i myself shall make a fuss if you don’t go,” said winterbourne.
“that’s all i want—a little fuss!” and the young girl began to laugh again.
“mr. randolph has gone

 to bed!” the courier announced frigidly.
“oh, daisy; now we can go!” said mrs. miller.
daisy turned away from winterbourne, looking at him, smiling and fanning herself. “good night,” she said; “i hope you are disappointed, or disgusted, or something!”
he looked at her, taking the hand she offered him. “i am puzzled,” he answered.
“well, i hope it won’t keep you awake!” she said very smartly; and, under the escort of the privileged eugenio, the two ladies passed toward the house.
winterbourne stood looking after them; he was indeed puzzled. he lingered beside the lake for a quarter of an hour, turning over the mystery of the young girl’s sudden familiarities and caprices. but the only very definite conclusion he came to was that he should enjoy deucedly “going off” with her somewhere.
two days afterward he went off with her to the castle of chillon. he waited for her in the large hall of the hotel, where the couriers, the s

o encounter your reproaches?”
“just hear him say that!” said daisy to her hostess, giving a twist to a bow on this lady’s dress. “did you ever hear anything so quaint?”
“so quaint, my dear?” murmured mrs. walker in the tone of a partisan of winterbourne.
“well, i don’t know,” said daisy, fingering mrs. walker’s ribbons. “mrs. walker, i want to tell you something.”
“mother-r,” interposed randolph, with his rough ends to his words, “i tell you you’ve got to go. eugenio’ll raise—something!”
“i’m not afraid of eugenio,” said daisy with a toss of her head. “look here, mrs. walker,” she went on, “you know i’m coming to your party.”
“i am delighted to hear it.”
“i’ve got a lovely dress!”
“i am very sure of that.”
“but i want to ask a favor—permission to bring a friend.”
“i shall be happy to see any of your friends,” said mrs. walker, turning with a smile to mrs. miller.
“oh, they are not my friends,” answered daisy

ontinued to glance at winterbourne. “the pincio is only a hundred yards distant; and if mr. winterbourne were as polite as he pretends, he would offer to walk with me!”
winterbourne’s politeness hastened to affirm itself, and the young girl gave him gracious leave to accompany her. they passed downstairs before her mother, and at the door winterbourne perceived mrs. miller’s carriage drawn up, with the ornamental courier whose acquaintance he had made at vevey seated within. “goodbye, eugenio!” cried daisy; “i’m going to take a walk.” the distance from the via gregoriana to the beautiful garden at the other end of the pincian hill is, in fact, rapidly traversed. as the day was splendid, however, and the concourse of vehicles, walkers, and loungers numerous, the young americans found their progress much delayed. this fact was highly agreeable to winterbourne, in spite of his consciousness of his singular situation. the slow-moving, idly gazing roman crowd bestowed much attent

ain a good while after it stopped!” cried the young girl with her little laugh. “i suppose you were asleep. you have had time to go to see mrs. walker.”
“i knew mrs. walker—” winterbourne began to explain.
“i know where you knew her. you knew her at geneva. she told me so. well, you knew me at vevey. that’s just as good. so you ought to have come.” she asked him no other question than this; she began to prattle about her own affairs. “we’ve got splendid rooms at the hotel; eugenio says they’re the best rooms in rome. we are going to stay all winter, if we don’t die of the fever; and i guess we’ll stay then. it’s a great deal nicer than i thought; i thought it would be fearfully quiet; i was sure it would be awfully poky. i was sure we should be going round all the time with one of those dreadful old men that explain about the pictures and things. but we only had about a week of that, and now i’m enjoying myself. i know ever so many people, and they are all so c

winterbourne arrived, daisy miller was not there, but in a few moments he saw her mother come in alone, very shyly and ruefully. mrs. miller’s hair above her exposed-looking temples was more frizzled than ever. as she approached mrs. walker, winterbourne also drew near.
“you see, i’ve come all alone,” said poor mrs. miller. “i’m so frightened; i don’t know what to do. it’s the first time i’ve ever been to a party alone, especially in this country. i wanted to bring randolph or eugenio, or someone, but daisy just pushed me off by myself. i ain’t used to going round alone.”
“and does not your daughter intend to favor us with her society?” demanded mrs. walker impressively.
“well, daisy’s all dressed,” said mrs. miller with that accent of the dispassionate, if not of the philosophic, historian with which she always recorded the current incidents of her daughter’s career. “she got dressed on purpose before dinner. but she’s got a friend of hers there; that ge

nd showed his brilliant teeth. but he took winterbourne’s rebuke with docility. “i told the signorina it was a grave indiscretion, but when was the signorina ever prudent?”
“i never was sick, and i don’t mean to be!” the signorina declared. “i don’t look like much, but i’m healthy! i was bound to see the colosseum by moonlight; i shouldn’t have wanted to go home without that; and we have had the most beautiful time, haven’t we, mr. giovanelli? if there has been any danger, eugenio can give me some pills. he has got some splendid pills.”
“i should advise you,” said winterbourne, “to drive home as fast as possible and take one!”
“what you say is very wise,” giovanelli rejoined. “i will go and make sure the carriage is at hand.” and he went forward rapidly.
daisy followed with winterbourne. he kept looking at her; she seemed not in the least embarrassed. winterbourne said nothing; daisy chattered about the beauty of the place. “well, i have seen the colo

rbourne, still laughing.
“well, what do you believe now?”
“i believe that it makes very little difference whether you are engaged or not!”
he felt the young girl’s pretty eyes fixed upon him through the thick gloom of the archway; she was apparently going to answer. but giovanelli hurried her forward. “quick! quick!” he said; “if we get in by midnight we are quite safe.”
daisy took her seat in the carriage, and the fortunate italian placed himself beside her. “don’t forget eugenio’s pills!” said winterbourne as he lifted his hat.
“i don’t care,” said daisy in a little strange tone, “whether i have roman fever or not!” upon this the cab driver cracked his whip, and they rolled away over the desultory patches of the antique pavement.
winterbourne, to do him justice, as it were, mentioned to no one that he had encountered miss miller, at midnight, in the colosseum with a gentleman; but nevertheless, a couple of days later, the fact of her having been there und
