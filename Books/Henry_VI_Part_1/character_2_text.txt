    what! shall we curse the planets of mishap
    that plotted thus our glory's overthrow?
    or shall we think the subtle-witted french
    conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him,
    by magic verses have contriv'd his end?
  winchester. he was a king bless'd of the king of kings;
    unto the french the dreadful judgment-day
    so dreadful will not be as was his sight.
    the battles of the lord of hosts he fought;
    the church's prayers made him so prosperous.
  gloucester. the church! where is it? had not churchmen
    pray'd,
    his thread of life had not so soon decay'd.
    none do you like but an effeminate prince,
    whom like a school-boy you may overawe.
  winchester. gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art
    protector
    and lookest to command the prince and realm.
    thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe
    more than god or religious churchmen may.

    sad tidings bring i to you out of france,
    of loss, of slaughter, and discomfiture:
    guienne, champagne, rheims, orleans,
    paris, guysors, poictiers, are all quite lost.
  bedford. what say'st thou, man, before dead henry's corse?
    speak softly, or the loss of those great towns
    will make him burst his lead and rise from death.
  gloucester. is paris lost? is rouen yielded up?
    if henry were recall'd to life again,
    these news would cause him once more yield the ghost.
  exeter. how were they lost? what treachery was us'd?
  messenger. no treachery, but want of men and money.
    amongst the soldiers this is muttered
    that here you maintain several factions;
    and whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,
    you are disputing of your generals:

    this ornament of knighthood--yea or no.

    o monstrous treachery! can this be so
    that in alliance, amity, and oaths,
    there should be found such false dissembling guile?
  king henry. what! doth my uncle burgundy revolt?
  gloucester. he doth, my lord, and is become your foe.
  king henry. is that the worst this letter doth contain?
  gloucester. it is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.
  king henry. why then lord talbot there shall talk with
    him
    and give him chastisement for this abuse.
    how say you, my lord, are you not content?
  talbot. content, my liege! yes; but that i am prevented,
    i should have begg'd i might have been employ'd.
