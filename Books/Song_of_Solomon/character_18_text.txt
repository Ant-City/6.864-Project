and his travel on a wagon, so far
distant psychologically and economically from milkman dead, reflects the
very soil and work to which the people of shalimar are rooted. milkman has
been shocked into the recognition that he will not be allowed to break the
circle of connectedness extending generations before his own existence.
his rediscovery of his humanity makes him sensitive enough to susan
byrdâ€™s information to realize that the children in shalimar are singing about
his great-grandmother, ryna, and his great-grandfather, solomon. he deciphers
names and connects their songs to pilateâ€™s blues song about sugarman.
the puzzle of family history becomes more engaging than searching for gold.
knowing oneâ€™s name, being able to call it in spite of personal or institutional
distortions, becomes all important to milkman. he understands that names
have â€œmeaning,â€ as pilate has understood by putting hers in her ear. he comes

in his egotistical focus on self, he had â€œgone off and leftâ€ hagar in the same
way that his great-grandfather had gone and left ryna. in fact, milkmanâ€™s
reflections upon hagar spur his recognition of his family in the song sung
by the children. in his remorse over hagar, he begins to feel a sense of family
responsibility and commitment negated in his great-grandfatherâ€™s action
of flying away from his family.
throughout his life, milkman has been â€œleavingâ€ his familyâ€”through
his disdain and hatred for his mother and father, through his condescension
toward his sisters, and through his now recognized mistreatment of

he has left a string of bodies like his great-grandfather left ryna and jake,
milkmanâ€™s grandfather. where the paths converge signals a new beginning
for milkman, but it may be an ambiguous one. the exhilaration he feels upon
learning that solomon could fly is matched by the tragic circumstances surrounding
that fantastic event. the celebration of flying simultaneously highlights
rynaâ€™s insanity and the fatherlessness of solomonâ€™s twenty-one sons.
happiness in the knowledge of flight leads to the enigma of unhappiness in
the consequences of the flight. flying, then, becomes a selfish celebration of
the freedom of an individual judged against the enslavement of twenty-two
people.23 the selfish path milkman has followed throughout his life parallels
the flight of his great-grandfather and its symbolic implications.

to hagar, chances are they would not be able to execute that desire. also,
the extent of milkmanâ€™s transgressions warrants a more striking lesson than

a mere forgiving and making up. hagarâ€™s death points out the emotionally
destructive binge milkman has been on all his life. morrison does not spare
him from having to confront the trauma resulting from that crime.
hagar, another body milkman has left in his â€œflyingâ€ pursuit of his greatgrandfather,
is like ryna or one of the twenty-one children solomon left on
his flight to africa. like ryna, the desertion leads to insanity and death. but,
also like ryna, who lives on in the tales of rynaâ€™s gulch, hagar will live on in
the lessons she has taught and in the box of her hair pilate gives to milkman
as an indication that he must take responsibility for â€œthe life he had takenâ€
(332). victims in the examples of their fates, both hagar and ryna enable
milkman to transcend the possibility for future vic

 for an enlightened milkman, is difficult to acquiesce to. yet it is consistent
with pilateâ€™s prediction about who would save milkmanâ€™s life, and it is
consistent with the traditional demise of the helper/guide once the initiate
has learned all the helper has to teach. milkman has definitely learned the
value of family and of human relationships, and he has learned that escape
from a situation does not lessen responsibility for it: he is as guilty for hagarâ€™s
death as solomon has been for rynaâ€™s insanity and for whatever happened to
his twenty-one sons. he can now effectively take his teacherâ€™s place, become
the guru rather than the seeker after knowledge held by the guru.
such a refined interpretation, however, does not alter the evaluation that
pilate joins the other women in milkmanâ€™s life in being made a victim to
his health, to his growth into a positive sense of self. milkmanâ€™s inability to

 able to piece together his genealogy. symbols of flying permeate the
childrenâ€™s ritual while, as they sing, one child â€œturn[s] around like an airplaneâ€
(267). and as they sing, milkman listens to them recount the flight
from slavery of his grandfatherâ€™s father, solomon or shalimar, back to the
freedom of his african homeland. the song is both a variant of the flying
african folktales and of the icarus tale. solomon literally flies off with
his infant son, jake, leaving behind his wife, ryna, and some twenty other
children. susan byrd, cousin to jakeâ€™s wife, sing, confirms to milkman the
magical tale behind the song:
â€œno, i mean flew. . . . he was flying. he flew. you know like a bird.
just stood up in the fields one day, ran up some hill, spun around a
couple of times, and was lifted up in the air.â€ (326)
but, as susan continues, solomon â€œâ€˜brushed too close to a tree and the baby
slipped out of his armsâ€™â€ (327), so that jake, too, was left behind which signaled

ntity and independence, for a freedom that transcends his own
blighted world. however, pilateâ€™s interposition furthers the mythic contradiction
because she rightly blames milkman for hagarâ€™s death; like solomon, he
had flown off and left a body.
in the cellar-cave, milkman begins to comprehend this contradiction,
and by doing so, he experiences a true metamorphosis and eventual reemergence
into his community. he makes the connection between his desertion
of hagar to solomonâ€™s desertion of ryna and the twenty-one children, as he
wonders to himself, â€œwho looked after those twenty children? jesus christ,
he left twenty-one children!â€ (336). milkman realizes that the locus for his
personal identity is inextricably linked to pilateâ€™s principle of responsibility
to others. and thus, he learns that objectification and commodification of
people only serve to further his sense of distortion and alienation. when
milkman finally tells pilate of his discoveries, the two return to shalimar

based on pilateâ€™s and his fatherâ€™s
partial revelations. from her, milkman learns the names of sing and jake
dead (song 243, 248), and that someone â€œdumpedâ€ the elder maconâ€™s body in
hunters cave after his original shallow grave eroded (244). susan byrd later
significantly verifies and augments this information. she confirms that the
full version of singâ€™s name is indeed singing bird, identifies singâ€™s adopted
brother (susanâ€™s father) as crow bird, and verifies the names of jake, ryna,
and heddy. moreover, susan clears up milkmanâ€™s misconception that jake
was the only son of solomon and explains the legend of the flying african
(321â€“23). although one might argue that these multiple verifications also
derive from a human memory subject to the same sort of error and partiality
that quentin distrusts, morrison provides yet another level of verification in
the actual song of solomon. the song functions as an oral history, one much
more vital than any written historical recor

she quotes quincy jonesâ€™s observation in downbeat magazine:
we didnâ€™t have writers, but we did have music, and the music was
the vehicle to carry the remnants of black history. the true history
of blacks is not in our history books, but in the music. our history

history is locked in milkmanâ€™s grandmotherâ€™s name sing, and in his greatgrandmotherâ€™s
name, ryna, the ancient hebrew word for song of rejoicing,
and, of course, in his great-grandfather solomonâ€™s song (â€œrynaâ€). solomon
is associated with wisdom and he was the last king of a united jewish kingdom,
a type of the new jerusalem. the song reaches outside the hebrew
and christian canons to include traditional african and islamic types.

 of milkman, who will later hear
the song performed by his aunts and cousin, with solomon replacing sugarman,
providing the key to his patrimony. naming and narrativity are inextricably
woven together in this instance, and it is the voices of women (and
later children) who transmit this patrimony, and who contest its significance
and meaning. for milkman the tale is self-affirming and heroic, but the wise
women of shalimar read it differently. susan byrd (milkmanâ€™s great-aunt)
focuses more on ryna, solomonâ€™s wife, and their twenty-one children, abandoned
when sugarman flew to freedom. it would seem that the discovery of
milkmanâ€™s true name requires him to burrow through layers or distortions of
namesâ€”sugarman, charlemagne, solomon, shalimarâ€”that also signify an
absence of narrative fixity or certitude; versions of stories change according
to who tells them.
the relationship between names and narrative is established early in the

to slide the elements of his grandfatherâ€™s history into their original positions,
and thus to discover the names of his forefathers and foremothers: jake and

ryna. the momentum for this quest for knowledge, however, is his fatherâ€™s
greed; macon dead still lusts for the prospectorâ€™s gold, so does guitar, sunday

gold as freedom from the overpowering unhappiness of his family. his quest,
however, will evolve into a search for personal and cultural identity, an identity
that individuates him from the father who bullies his wife and daughters,
neglects and repudiates his only sister, a

ickly turns to the archetypal myth in which a youth
proves his masculinity by hunting with the men. while this tale is completed
within the compass of chapter 11, the remainder of the novel contests this
apparently heroic resolution. the mythic subtext is interleaved with the narratives
of hagar and guitar. as milkman is putting the pieces of his story
together, the jilted hagar dies of a broken heart. unlike him she has not successfully
completed her coming of age.26 instead she corresponds to ryna,
the woman whom milkmanâ€™s great-grandfather left behind when he flew
away, and whose story offered by susan byrd serves to devalue solomonâ€™s
flight. it is during his visit with susan that milkman finally loses his watch;
the reader is alerted that the linear time of the bildungsroman is not what
structures this tale after all.
the second to last chapter of the novel is permeated with the voices of
women, pilate in particular, who sings a song of lamentation at her granddaughterâ€™s
funeral.
