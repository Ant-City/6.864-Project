arth-rug and picked up the
stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before. it was a
fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as
a â€œpenang lawyer.â€ just under the head was a broad silver band nearly
an inch across. â€œto james mortimer, m.r.c.s., from his friends of the
c.c.h.,â€ was engraved upon it, with the date â€œ1884.â€ it was just such a
stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry--dignified,
solid, and reassuring.

â€œwell, watson, what do you make of it?â€

holmes was sitting with his back to me, and i had given him no sign of
my occupation.

â€œhow did you know what i was doing? i believe you have eyes in the back
of your head.â€

â€œi have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front of
me,â€ said he. â€œbut, tell me, watson, what do you make of our visitorâ€™s
stick? since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no
notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance.

the thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he has done a
great amount of walking with it.â€

â€œperfectly sound!â€ said holmes.

â€œand then again, there is the â€˜friends of the c.c.h.â€™ i should guess
that to be the something hunt, the local hunt to whose members he has
possibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a small
presentation in return.â€

â€œreally, watson, you excel yourself,â€ said holmes, pushing back his
chair and lighting a cigarette. â€œi am bound to say that in all the
accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small
achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities. it may
be that you are not yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of
light. some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of
stimulating it. i confess, my dear fellow, that i am very much in your
debt.â€

of interest he laid down his cigarette,
and carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a
convex lens.

â€œinteresting, though elementary,â€ said he as he returned to his
favourite corner of the settee. â€œthere are certainly one or two
indications upon the stick. it gives us the basis for several
deductions.â€

â€œhas anything escaped me?â€ i asked with some self-importance. â€œi trust
that there is nothing of consequence which i have overlooked?â€

â€œi am afraid, my dear watson, that most of your conclusions were
erroneous. when i said that you stimulated me i meant, to be frank, that
in noting your fallacies i was occasionally guided towards the truth.
not that you are entirely wrong in this instance. the man is certainly a
country practitioner. and he walks a good deal.â€

â€œthen i was right.â€

â€œto that extent.â€

â€œbut that was all.â€

â€œno, no, my dear watson, not all--by no means all. i would suggest, for
example, that a presentation to a doctor is more

ll observe that he could not have been on the staff of the
hospital, since only a man well-established in a london practice could
hold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country.
what was he, then? if he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he
could only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician--little more
than a senior student. and he left five years ago--the date is on the
stick. so your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into
thin air, my dear watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty,
amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite
dog, which i should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and
smaller than a mastiff.â€

i laughed incredulously as sherlock holmes leaned back in his settee and
blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.

â€œas to the latter part, i have no means of checking you,â€ said i, â€œbut
at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the

of the window. there was such a ring of conviction in his voice that i
glanced up in surprise.

â€œmy dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?â€

â€œfor the very simple reason that i see the dog himself on our very
door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. donâ€™t move, i beg you,
watson. he is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be
of assistance to me. now is the dramatic moment of fate, watson, when
you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you
know not whether for good or ill. what does dr. james mortimer, the man
of science, ask of sherlock holmes, the specialist in crime? come in!â€

the appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since i had expected
a typical country practitioner. he was a very tall, thin man, with a

â€œno, this is my friend dr. watson.â€

â€œglad to meet you, sir. i have heard your name mentioned in connection
with that of your friend. you interest me very much, mr. holmes. i

supra-orbital development. would you have any objection to my running my

whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much
excitement in devonshire. i may say that i was his personal friend as
well as his medical attendant. he was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd,
practical, and as unimaginative as i am myself. yet he took this
document very seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end
as did eventually overtake him.â€

holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon
his knee. â€œyou will observe, watson, the alternative use of the long s
and the short. it is one of several indications which enabled me to fix
the date.â€

i looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script. at
the head was written: â€œbaskerville hall,â€ and below in large, scrawling
figures: â€œ1742.â€

â€œit appears to be a statement of some sort.â€

â€œyes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the
baskerville family.â€

â€œbut i understand that it is something more modern and practical upo

â€œabout four feet high.â€

â€œthen anyone could have got over it?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œand what marks did you see by the wicket-gate?â€

â€œnone in particular.â€

â€œgood heaven! did no one examine?â€

â€œyes, i examined, myself.â€

â€œand found nothing?â€

â€œit was all very confused. sir charles had evidently stood there for
five or ten minutes.â€

â€œhow do you know that?â€

â€œbecause the ash had twice dropped from his cigar.â€

â€œexcellent! this is a colleague, watson, after our own heart. but the
marks?â€

â€œhe had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel. i could
discern no others.â€

sherlock holmes struck his hand against his knee with an impatient
gesture.

â€œif i had only been there!â€ he cried. â€œit is evidently a case of
extraordinary interest, and one which presented immense opportunities to
the scientific expert. that gravel page upon which i might have read so
much has been long ere this smudged by the rain and defaced by the c

fashion. holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.

â€œonly one more question, dr. mortimer. you say that before sir charles
baskervilleâ€™s death several people saw this apparition upon the moor?â€

â€œthree people did.â€

â€œdid any see it after?â€

â€œi have not heard of any.â€

â€œthank you. good-morning.â€

holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction
which meant that he had a congenial task before him.

â€œgoing out, watson?â€

â€œunless i can help you.â€

â€œno, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that i turn to you for
aid. but this is splendid, really unique from some points of view.
when you pass bradleyâ€™s, would you ask him to send up a pound of the
strongest shag tobacco? thank you. it would be as well if you could make
it convenient not to return before evening. then i should be very glad
to compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has
been submitted to us this morning.â€

sion as i opened the door was that a fire had broken out,
for the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp upon
the table was blurred by it. as i entered, however, my fears were set at
rest, for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco which took me
by the throat and set me coughing. through the haze i had a vague vision
of holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his black
clay pipe between his lips. several rolls of paper lay around him.

â€œcaught cold, watson?â€ said he.

â€œno, itâ€™s this poisonous atmosphere.â€

â€œi suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it.â€

â€œthick! it is intolerable.â€

â€œopen the window, then! you have been at your club all day, i perceive.â€

â€œmy dear holmes!â€

â€œam i right?â€

â€œcertainly, but how?â€

he laughed at my bewildered expression. â€œthere is a delightful freshness
about you, watson, which makes it a pleasure to exercise any small
powers which i possess at your expense. a gentleman goes

â€œwhat do you make of it?â€

â€œit is very bewildering.â€

â€œit has certainly a character of its own. there are points of
distinction about it. that change in the footprints, for example. what
do you make of that?â€

â€œmortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of
the alley.â€

â€œhe only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. why should a
man walk on tiptoe down the alley?â€

â€œwhat then?â€

â€œhe was running, watson--running desperately, running for his life,
running until he burst his heart--and fell dead upon his face.â€

â€œrunning from what?â€

â€œthere lies our problem. there are indications that the man was crazed
with fear before ever he began to run.â€

â€œhow can you say that?â€

â€œi am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the moor.
if that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man who had lost his
wits would have run from the house instead of towards it. if the

but the ground was damp and the night inclement. is it natural
that he should stand for five or ten minutes, as dr. mortimer, with more
practical sense than i should have given him credit for, deduced from
the cigar ash?â€

â€œbut he went out every evening.â€

â€œi think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every evening. on
the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the moor. that night he
waited there. it was the night before he made his departure for london.
the thing takes shape, watson. it becomes coherent. might i ask you to
hand me my violin, and we will postpone all further thought upon this
business until we have had the advantage of meeting dr. mortimer and sir
henry baskerville in the morning.â€




chapter 4. sir henry baskerville



our breakfast table was cleared early, and holmes waited in his
dressing-gown for the promised interview. our clients were punctual to
their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when dr. mortimer
was shown up, followed by the yo

that the business is supernatural.â€

â€œwhat business?â€ asked sir henry sharply. â€œit seems to me that all you
gentlemen know a great deal more than i do about my own affairs.â€

â€œyou shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, sir henry. i
promise you that,â€ said sherlock holmes. â€œwe will confine ourselves
for the present with your permission to this very interesting document,
which must have been put together and posted yesterday evening. have you
yesterdayâ€™s times, watson?â€

â€œit is here in the corner.â€

â€œmight i trouble you for it--the inside page, please, with the leading
articles?â€ he glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes up and down the
columns. â€œcapital article this on free trade. permit me to give you an
extract from it.

     â€˜you may be cajoled into imagining that your own special
     trade or your own industry will be encouraged by a
     protective tariff, but it stands to reason that such

â€œwhat do you think of that, watson?â€ cried holmes in high glee, rubbing
his hands together with satisfaction. â€œdonâ€™t you think that is an
admirable sentiment?â€

dr. mortimer looked at holmes with an air of professional interest, and
sir henry baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.

â€œi donâ€™t know much about the tariff and things of that kind,â€ said he,
â€œbut it seems to me weâ€™ve got a bit off the trail so far as that note is
concerned.â€

â€œon the contrary, i think we are particularly hot upon

the trail, sir
henry. watson here knows more about my methods than you do, but i fear
that even he has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence.â€

â€œno, i confess that i see no connection.â€

â€œand yet, my dear watson, there is so very close a connection that
the one is extracted out of the other. â€˜you,â€™ â€˜your,â€™ â€˜your,â€™ â€˜life,â€™
â€˜reason,â€™ â€˜value,â€™ â€˜keep away,â€™ â€˜from the.â€™ donâ€™t you see now whence
these words have been taken?â€

â€œby thunder, youâ€™re right! well, if that isnâ€™t smart!â€ cried sir henry.

â€œif any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that â€˜keep
awayâ€™ and â€˜from theâ€™ are cut out in one piece.â€

â€œwell, now--so it is!â€

it was evident that the fiery temper of the baskervilles was not extinct
in this their last representative. â€œmeanwhile,â€ said he, â€œi have hardly
had time to think over all that you have told me. itâ€™s a big thing for a
man to have to understand and to decide at one sitting. i should like
to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind. now, look here, mr.
holmes, itâ€™s half-past eleven now and i am going back right away to my
hotel. suppose you and your friend, dr. watson, come round and lunch
with us at two. iâ€™ll be able to tell you more clearly then how this
thing strikes me.â€

â€œis that convenient to you, watson?â€

â€œperfectly.â€

â€œthen you may expect us. shall i have a cab called?â€

â€œiâ€™d prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather.â€

â€œiâ€™ll join you in a walk, with pleasure,â€ said his companion.

â€œthen we meet again at two oâ€™clock. au revoir, and good-morning!â€

we heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and

 the bang of the
front door. in an instant holmes had changed from the languid dreamer to
the man of action.

â€œyour hat and boots, watson, quick! not a moment to lose!â€ he rushed
into his room in his dressing-gown and was back again in a few seconds
in a frock-coat. we hurried together down the stairs and into the
street. dr. mortimer and baskerville were still visible about two
hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of oxford street.

â€œshall i run on and stop them?â€

â€œnot for the world, my dear watson. i am perfectly satisfied with your
company if you will tolerate mine. our friends are wise, for it is
certainly a ve

ed the distance which divided
us by about half. then, still keeping a hundred yards behind, we
followed into oxford street and so down regent street. once our friends
stopped and stared into a shop window, upon which holmes did the
same. an instant afterwards he gave a little cry of satisfaction, and,
following the direction of his eager eyes, i saw that a hansom cab with
a man inside which had halted on the other side of the street was now
proceeding slowly onward again.


â€œthereâ€™s our man, watson! come along! weâ€™ll have a good look at him, if
we can do no more.â€

at that instant i was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of
piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab.
instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed to
the driver, and the cab flew madly off down regent street. holmes looked
eagerly round for another, but no empty one was in sight. then he dashed
in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic, but the start was too
great, and a

lready the cab was out of sight.

â€œthere now!â€ said holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white with
vexation from the tide of vehicles. â€œwas ever such bad luck and such
bad management, too? watson, watson, if you are an honest man you will
record this also and set it against my successes!â€

â€œwho was the man?â€

â€œi have not an idea.â€

â€œa spy?â€

â€œwell, it was evident from what we have heard that baskerville has been
very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town. how else
could it be known so quickly that it was the northumberland hotel which
he had chosen? if they had followed him the first day i argued that they
would follow him also the second. you may have observed t

hat i twice
strolled over to the window while dr. mortimer was reading his legend.â€

â€œyes, i remember.â€

â€œi was looking out for loiterers in the street, but i saw none. we
are dealing with a clever man, watson. this matter cuts very deep, and
though i have not finally made up my mind whether it is a benevolent or
a malevolent agency which is in touch with us, i am conscious always of
power and design. when our friends left i at once followed them in the
hopes of marking down their invisible attendant. so wily was he that he
had not trusted himself upon foot, but he had availed himself of a cab
so that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their
notice. his method had the additional a

dvantage that if they were to
take a cab he was all ready to follow them. it has, however, one obvious
disadvantage.â€

â€œit puts him in the power of the cabman.â€

â€œexactly.â€

â€œwhat a pity we did not get the number!â€

â€œmy dear watson, clumsy as i have been, you surely do not seriously
imagine that i neglected to get the number? no. 2704 is our man. but
that is no use to us for the moment.â€

â€œi fail to see how you could have done more.â€

â€œon observing the cab i should have instantly turned and walked in the
other direction. i should then at my leisure have hired a second cab
and followed the first at a respectful distance, or, better still, have
driven to the northumberland hotel and waited there. when our unknown

front of us.

â€œthere is no object in our following them,â€ said holmes. â€œthe shadow has
departed and will not return. we must see what further cards we have
in our hands and play them with decision. could you swear to that manâ€™s
face within the cab?â€

â€œi could swear only to the beard.â€

â€œand so could i--from which i gather that in all probability it was
a false one. a clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for a
beard save to conceal his features. come in here, watson!â€

he turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he was
warmly greeted by the manager.

â€œah, wilson, i see you have not forgotten the little case in which i had
the good fortune to help you?â€

â€œno, sir, indeed i have not. you saved my good name, and perhaps my
life.â€

â€œmy dear fellow, you exaggerate. i have some recollection, wilson, that
you had among your boys a lad named cartwright, who showed some ability
during the investigation.â€

â€œyes, sir, he is still with

then learn in possibly twenty cases out of the twenty-three that the

cases you will be shown a heap of paper and you will look for this page
of the times among it. the odds are enormously against your finding
it. there are ten shillings over in case of emergencies. let me have a
report by wire at baker street before evening. and now, watson, it only
remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman, no. 2704,
and then we will drop into one of the bond street picture galleries and
fill in the time until we are due at the hotel.â€




chapter 5. three broken threads



sherlock holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of detaching
his mind at will. for two hours the strange business in which we had
been involved appeared to be forgotten, and he was entirely absorbed in
the pictures of the modern belgian master

â€œno, sir! he has used this hotel for many years, and he is very well
known to us.â€

â€œah, that settles it. mrs. oldmore, too; i seem to remember the name.
excuse my curiosity, but often in calling upon one friend one finds
another.â€

â€œshe is an invalid lady, sir. her husband was once mayor of gloucester.
she always comes to us when she is in town.â€

â€œthank you; i am afraid i cannot claim her acquaintance. we have
established a most important fact by these questions, watson,â€ he
continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together. â€œwe know now that
the people who are so interested in our friend have not settled down
in his own hotel. that means that while they are, as we have seen, very
anxious to watch him, they are equally anxious that he should not see
them. now, this is a most suggestive fact.â€

â€œwhat does it suggest?â€

â€œit suggests--halloa, my dear fellow, what on earth is the matter?â€

as we came round the top of the stairs we had run up agai

you will see how impossible it is for me to go to dartmoor.â€

â€œwhom would you recommend, then?â€

holmes laid his hand upon my arm. â€œif my friend would undertake it there
is no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in a
tight place. no one can say so more confidently than i.â€

the proposition took me completely by surprise, but before i had time to
answer, baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it heartily.

â€œwell, now, that is real kind of you, dr. watson,â€ said he. â€œyou see how
it is with me, and you know just as much about the matter as i do. if
you will come down to baskerville hall and see me through iâ€™ll never
forget it.â€

the promise of adventure had always a fascination for me, and i was
complimented by the words of holmes and by the eagerness with which the
baronet hailed me as a companion.

â€œi will come, with pleasure,â€ said i. â€œi do not know how i could employ
my time better.â€

â€œand you will report very carefully to m

â€œwould that suit dr. watson?â€

â€œperfectly.â€

â€œthen on saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall meet at the
ten-thirty train from paddington.â€

we had risen to depart when baskerville gave a cry, of triumph, and
diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown boot from
under a cabinet.

â€œmy missing boot!â€ he cried.

â€œmay all our difficulties vanish as easily!â€ said sherlock holmes.

â€œbut it is a very singular thing,â€ dr. mortimer remarked. â€œi searched

all afternoon and late into the evening he sat lost in tobacco and
thought.

â€œthere go two of my threads, watson. there is nothing more stimulating
than a case where everything goes against you. we must cast round for
another scent.â€

â€œwe have still the cabman who drove the spy.â€

â€œexactly. i have wired to get his name and address from the official
registry. i should not be surprised if this were an answer to my
question.â€

the ring at the bell proved to be something even more satisfactory
than an answer, however, for the door opened and a rough-looking fellow
entered who was evidently the man h

â€œwhen he left me.â€

â€œdid he say anything more?â€

â€œhe mentioned his name.â€

holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me. â€œoh, he mentioned his name,
did he? that was imprudent. what was the name that he mentioned?â€

â€œhis name,â€ said the cabman, â€œwas mr. sherlock holmes.â€

never have i seen my friend more completely taken aback than by the
cabmanâ€™s reply. for an instant he sat in silent amazement. then he burst
into a hearty laugh.

â€œa touch, watson--an undeniable touch!â€ said he. â€œi feel a foil as quick
and supple as my own. he got home upon me very prettily that time. so
his name was sherlock holmes, was it?â€

â€œyes, sir, that was the gentlemanâ€™s name.â€

â€œexcellent! tell me where you picked him up and all that occurred.â€

â€œhe hailed me at half-past nine in trafalgar square. he said that he was
a detective, and he offered me two guineas if i would do exactly what he
wanted all day and ask no questions. i was glad enough t

his shoulders and a rueful smile.

â€œsnap goes our third thread, and we end where we began,â€ said he. â€œthe
cunning rascal! he knew our number, knew that sir henry baskerville had
consulted me, spotted who i was in regent street, conjectured that i had
got the number of the cab and would lay my hands on the driver, and so
sent back this audacious message. i tell you, watson, this time we have
got a foeman who is worthy of our steel. iâ€™ve been checkmated in london.
i can only wish you better luck in devonshire. but iâ€™m not easy in my
mind about it.â€

â€œabout what?â€

â€œabout sending you. itâ€™s an ugly business, watson, an ugly dangerous
business, and the more i see of it the less i like it. yes, my dear
fellow, you may laugh, but i give you my word that i shall be very glad
to have you back safe and sound in baker street once more.â€

e of my two companions and in playing with
dr. mortimerâ€™s spaniel. in a very few hours the brown earth had
become ruddy, the brick had changed to granite, and red cows grazed in
well-hedged fields where the lush grasses and more luxuriant vegetation
spoke of a richer, if a damper, climate. young baskerville stared
eagerly out of the window and cried aloud with delight as he recognized
the familiar features of the devon scenery.

â€œiâ€™ve been over a good part of the world since i left it, dr. watson,â€
 said he; â€œbut i have never seen a place to compare with it.â€

â€œi never saw a devonshire man who did not swear by his county,â€ i
remarked.

â€œit depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the county,â€ said
dr. mortimer. â€œa glance at our friend here reveals the rounded head of
the celt, which carries inside it the celtic enthusiasm and power
of attachment. poor sir charlesâ€™s head was of a very rare type, half
gaelic, half ivernian in its characteristics. but you were ve

when you last saw baskerville hall, were you not?â€

â€œi was a boy in my teens at the time of my fatherâ€™s death and had never
seen the hall, for he lived in a little cottage on the south coast.
thence i went straight to a friend in america. i tell you it is all as
new to me as it is to dr. watson, and iâ€™m as keen as possible to see the
moor.â€

â€œare you? then your wish is easily granted, for there is your first
sight of the moor,â€ said dr. mortimer, pointing out of the carriage
window.

over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood there
rose in the distance a gray, melancholy hill, with a strange jagged
summit, dim and vague in the distance, like some fantastic landscape in
a dream. baskerville sat for a long time, his eyes fixed upon it, and i

behind me and by a voice which called me by name. i turned, expecting to
see dr. mortimer, but to my surprise it was a stranger who was pursuing
me. he was a small, slim, clean-shaven, prim-faced man, flaxen-haired
and leanjawed, between thirty and forty years of age, dressed in a gray
suit and wearing a straw hat. a tin box for botanical specimens hung
over his shoulder and he carried a green butterfly-net in one of his
hands.

â€œyou will, i am sure, excuse my presumption, dr. watson,â€ said he as he
came panting up to where i stood. â€œhere on the moor we are homely folk
and do not wait for formal introductions. you may possibly have heard
my name from our mutual friend, mortimer. i am stapleton, of merripit
house.â€

â€œyour net and box would have told me as much,â€ said i, â€œfor i knew that
mr. stapleton was a naturalist. but how did you know me?â€

â€œi have been calling on mortimer, and he pointed you out to me from
the window of his surgery as you passed. as our

â€

â€œhow did you know that?â€

â€œmy friend mortimer told me.â€

â€œyou think, then, that some dog pursued sir charles, and that he died of
fright in consequence?â€

â€œhave you any better explanation?â€

â€œi have not come to any conclusion.â€

â€œhas mr. sherlock holmes?â€

the words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the placid
face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no surprise was
intended.

â€œit is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, dr. watson,â€
 said he. â€œthe records of your detective have reached us here, and you
could not celebrate him without being known yourself. when mortimer told
me your name he could not deny your identity. if you are here, then it
follows that mr. sherlock holmes is interesting himself in the matter,
and i am naturally curious to know what view he may take.â€

â€œi am afraid that i cannot answer that question.â€

â€œmay i ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself?â€

â€œhe cannot leave town

couch if you have the curiosity to go inside.

â€œbut it is quite a town. when was it inhabited?â€

â€œneolithic man--no date.â€

â€œwhat did he do?â€

â€œhe grazed his cattle on these slopes, and he learned to dig for tin
when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe. look at the
great trench in the opposite hill. that is his mark. yes, you will find
some very singular points about the moor, dr. watson. oh, excuse me an
instant! it is surely cyclopides.â€

a small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in an instant
stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of
it. to my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire, and my
acquaintance never paused for an instant, bounding from tuft to tuft
behind it, his green net waving in the air. his gray clothes and jerky,
zigzag, irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself.

unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced incessantly from the
girl to me.

â€œyou have introduced yourselves, i can see.â€

â€œyes. i was telling sir henry that it was rather late for him to see the
true beauties of the moor.â€

â€œwhy, who do you think this is?â€

â€œi imagine that it must be sir henry baskerville.â€

â€œno, no,â€ said i. â€œonly a humble commoner, but his friend. my name is
dr. watson.â€

a flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. â€œwe have been
talking at cross purposes,â€ said she.

â€œwhy, you had not very much time for talk,â€ her brother remarked with
the same questioning eyes.

â€œi talked as if dr. watson were a resident instead of being merely a
visitor,â€ said she. â€œit cannot much matter to him whether it is early
or late for the orchids. but you will come on, will you not, and see
merripit house?â€

a short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland

in the school and three of the boys died. it never recovered from the
blow, and much of my capital was irretrievably swallowed up. and yet,
if it were not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys,
i could rejoice over my own misfortune, for, with my strong tastes
for botany and zoology, i find an unlimited field of work here, and my
sister is as devoted to nature as i am. all this, dr. watson, has been
brought upon your head by your expression as you surveyed the moor out
of our window.â€

â€œit certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dull--less for
you, perhaps, than for your sister.â€

â€œno, no, i am never dull,â€ said she quickly.

â€œwe have books, we have our studies, and we have interesting neighbours.

also an admirable companion. we knew him well and miss him more than

all pressure to stay for lunch, and i set off at once upon my return
journey, taking the grass-grown path by which we had come.

it seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for those
who knew it, for before i had reached the road i was astounded to see
miss stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side of the track. her face
was beautifully flushed with her exertions and she held her hand to her
side.

â€œi have run all the way in order to cut you off, dr. watson,â€ said she.
â€œi had not even time to put on my hat. i must not stop, or my brother
may miss me. i wanted to say to you how sorry i am about the stupid
mistake i made in thinking that you were sir henry. please forget the
words i said, which have no application whatever to you.â€

â€œbut i canâ€™t forget them, miss stapleton,â€ said i. â€œi am sir henryâ€™s
friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine. tell me why it

an expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her face, but
her eyes had hardened again when she answered me.

â€œyou make too much of it, dr. watson,â€ said she. â€œmy brother and i
were very much shocked by the death of sir charles. we knew him very
intimately, for his favourite walk was over the moor to our house. he
was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the family, and when
this tragedy came i naturally felt that there must be some grounds
for the fears which he had expressed. i was distressed therefore when
another member of the family came down to live here, and i felt that he
should be warned of the danger which he will

if he knew that i have said anything which might induce sir henry to

back, or he will miss me and suspect that i have seen you. good-bye!â€
 she turned and had disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered
boulders, while i, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way to
baskerville hall.




chapter 8. first report of dr. watson



from this point onward i will follow the course of events by
transcribing my own letters to mr. sherlock holmes which lie before me
on the table. one page is missing, but otherwise they are exactly
as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the moment more
accurately than my memory, clear as it is upon these tragic events, can
possibly do.


baskerville hall, october 13th. my dear holmes: my previous letters
and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to date as to all that has

there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which
sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of. i do not trouble you with
my theories, for you asked me to furnish you only with facts. i have
had a long talk with sir henry this morning, and we have made a plan of
campaign founded upon my observations of last night. i will not speak
about it just now, but it should make my next report interesting
reading.




chapter 9. the light upon the moor [second report of dr. watson]



baskerville hall, oct. 15th. my dear holmes: if i was compelled to
leave you without much news during the early days of my mission you must
acknowledge that i am making up for lost time, and that events are now
crowding thick and fast upon us. in my last report i ended upon my top
note with barrymore at the window, and now i have quite a budget already
which will, unless i am much mistaken, considerably surprise you. things
have taken a turn which i could not have anticipated. in some ways

than he is with our beautiful neighbour, miss stapleton. and yet the
course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as one would under
the circumstances expect. today, for example, its surface was broken
by a very unexpected ripple, which has caused our friend considerable
perplexity and annoyance.

after the conversation which i have quoted about barrymore, sir henry
put on his hat and prepared to go out. as a matter of course i did the
same.

â€œwhat, are you coming, watson?â€ he asked, looking at me in a curious
way.

â€œthat depends on whether you are going on the moor,â€ said i.

â€œyes, i am.â€

â€œwell, you know what my instructions are. i am sorry to intrude, but
you heard how earnestly holmes insisted that i should not leave you, and
especially that you should not go alone upon the moor.â€

sir henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile.

â€œmy dear fellow,â€ said he, â€œholmes, with all his wisdom, did not foresee
some things which have

in his displeasure. the
baronet stood for a minute looking after them, and then he walked slowly
back the way that he had come, his head hanging, the very picture of
dejection.

what all this meant i could not imagine, but i was deeply ashamed to
have witnessed so intimate a scene without my friendâ€™s knowledge. i ran
down the hill therefore and met the baronet at the bottom. his face was
flushed with anger and his brows were wrinkled, like one who is at his
witâ€™s ends what to do.

â€œhalloa, watson! where have you dropped from?â€ said he. â€œyou donâ€™t mean
to say that you came after me in spite of all?â€

i explained everything to him: how i had found it impossible to remain
behind, how i had followed him, and how i had witnessed all that
had occurred. for an instant his eyes blazed at me, but my frankness
disarmed his anger, and he broke at last into a rather rueful laugh.

â€œyou would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe
place for a man to be private,â€ said he, â

nyhow? youâ€™ve lived near me for some weeks,
watson. tell me straight, now! is there anything that would prevent me
from making a good husband to a woman that i loved?â€

â€œi should say not.â€

â€œhe canâ€™t object to my worldly position, so it must be myself that he
has this down on. what has he against me? i never hurt man or woman in
my life that i know of. and yet he would not so much as let me touch the
tips of her fingers.â€

â€œdid he say so?â€

â€œthat, and a deal more. i tell you, watson, iâ€™ve only known her these
few weeks, but from the first i just felt that she was made for me,
and she, too--she was happy when she was with me, and that iâ€™ll swear.
thereâ€™s a light in a womanâ€™s eyes that speaks louder than words. but he
has never let us get together and it was only today for the first time
that i saw a chance of having a few words with her alone. she was glad
to meet me, but when she did it was not love that she would talk about,
and she wouldnâ€™t have let me talk abo

as it was i told him that my feelings towards his sister were such as
i was not ashamed of, and that i hoped that she might honour me by
becoming my wife. that seemed to make the matter no better, so then i
lost my temper too, and i answered him rather more hotly than i should
perhaps, considering that she was standing by. so it ended by his going
off with her, as you saw, and here am i as badly puzzled a man as any
in this county. just tell me what it all means, watson, and iâ€™ll owe you
more than ever i can hope to pay.â€

i tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, i was completely puzzled
myself. our friendâ€™s title, his fortune, his age, his character, and his
appearance are all in his favour, and i know nothing against him unless
it be this dark fate which runs in his family. that his advances should
be rejected so brusquely without any reference to the ladyâ€™s own wishes
and that the lady should accept the situation without protest is very
amazing

arkness of the night. vaguely i could discern the black bank of the
trees and the lighter expanse of the moor, for the moon was behind the
clouds. and then i gave a cry of exultation, for a tiny pinpoint of
yellow light had suddenly transfixed the dark veil, and glowed steadily
in the centre of the black square framed by the window.

â€œthere it is!â€ i cried.

â€œno, no, sir, it is nothing--nothing at all!â€ the butler broke in; â€œi
assure you, sir--â€

â€œmove your light across the window, watson!â€ cried the baronet. â€œsee,
the other moves also! now, you rascal, do you deny that it is a signal?
come, speak up! who is your confederate out yonder, and what is this
conspiracy that is going on?â€

the manâ€™s face became openly defiant. â€œit is my business, and not yours.
i will not tell.â€

â€œthen you leave my employment right away.â€

â€œvery good, sir. if i must i must.â€

â€œand you go in disgrace. by thunder, you may well be ashamed of
yourself. your family has lived with mine

ind beat in upon our faces. far away
in the black distance there still glowed that one tiny point of yellow
light.

â€œi wonder he dares,â€ said sir henry.

â€œit may be so placed as to be only visible from here.â€

â€œvery likely. how far do you think it is?â€

â€œout by the cleft tor, i think.â€

â€œnot more than a mile or two off.â€

â€œhardly that.â€

â€œwell, it cannot be far if barrymore had to carry out the food to it.
and he is waiting, this villain, beside that candle. by thunder, watson,
i am going out to take that man!â€

the same thought had crossed my own mind. it was not as if the
barrymores had taken us into their confidence. their secret had been
forced from them. the man was a danger to the community, an unmitigated
scoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse. we were only doing
our duty in taking this chance of putting him back where he could do no
harm. with his brutal and violent nature, others would have to pay the
price if we held our hands. any night, fo

eaves. the night air was
heavy with the smell of damp and decay. now and again the moon peeped
out for an instant, but clouds were driving over the face of the sky,
and just as we came out on the moor a thin rain began to fall. the light
still burned steadily in front.

â€œare you armed?â€ i asked.

â€œi have a hunting-crop.â€

â€œwe must close in on him rapidly, for he is said to be a desperate
fellow. we shall take him by surprise and have him at our mercy before
he can resist.â€

â€œi say, watson,â€ said the baronet, â€œwhat would holmes say to this? how
about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil is exalted?â€

as if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast gloom
of the moor that strange cry which i had already heard upon the borders
of the great grimpen mire. it came with the wind through the silence
of the night, a long, deep mutter, then a rising howl, and then the sad
moan in which it died away. again and again it sounded, the whole air
throbbing with

 it, strident, wild, and menacing. the baronet caught my
sleeve and his face glimmered white through the darkness.

â€œmy god, whatâ€™s that, watson?â€

â€œi donâ€™t know. itâ€™s a sound they have on the moor. i heard it once
before.â€

it died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us. we stood
straining our ears, but nothing came.

â€œwatson,â€ said the baronet, â€œit was the cry of a hound.â€

my blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a break in his voice which
told of the sudden horror which had seized him.

â€œwhat do they call this sound?â€ he asked.

â€œwho?â€

â€œthe folk on the countryside.â€

â€œoh, they are ignora

nt people. why should you mind what they call it?â€

â€œtell me, watson. what do they say of it?â€

i hesitated but could not escape the question.

â€œthey say it is the cry of the hound of the baskervilles.â€

he groaned and was silent for a few moments.

â€œa hound it was,â€ he said at last, â€œbut it seemed to come from miles
away, over yonder, i think.â€

â€œit was hard to say whence it came.â€

â€œit rose and fell with the wind. isnâ€™t that the direction of the great
grimpen mire?â€

â€œyes, it is.â€

â€œwell, it was up there. come now, watson, didnâ€™

t you think yourself that
it was the cry of a hound? i am not a child. you need not fear to speak
the truth.â€

â€œstapleton was with me when i heard it last. he said that it might be
the calling of a strange bird.â€

â€œno, no, it was a hound. my god, can there be some truth in all these
stories? is it possible that i am really in danger from so dark a cause?
you donâ€™t believe it, do you, watson?â€

â€œno, no.â€

â€œand yet it was one thing to laugh about it in london, and it is another
to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear such a cry as
that. and my uncle! there was the footprint of the hound beside him as
he lay. it all fits together. i donâ€™t think that i am a coward, watson,
but that sound seemed to freeze my very blood. feel my hand!â€

it was as cold as a block of marble.

â€œi donâ€™t think iâ€™ll get that cry out of

certainly making some progress. so far as the barrymores go we have
found the motive of their actions, and that has cleared up the situation
very much. but the moor with its mysteries and its strange inhabitants
remains as inscrutable as ever. perhaps in my next i may be able to
throw some light upon this also. best of all would it be if you could
come down to us. in any case you will hear from me again in the course
of the next few days.




chapter 10. extract from the diary of dr. watson



so far i have been able to quote from the reports which i have forwarded
during these early days to sherlock holmes. now, however, i have arrived
at a point in my narrative where i am compelled to abandon this method
and to trust once more to my recollections, aided by the diary which
i kept at the time. a few extracts from the latter will carry me on to
those scenes which are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory. i
proceed, then, from the morning which followed our abortive chase

 trouble anyone in this country again. i assure you,
sir henry, that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have
been made and he will be on his way to south america. for godâ€™s sake,
sir, i beg of you not to let the police know that he is still on the
moor. they have given up the chase there, and he can lie quiet until the
ship is ready for him. you canâ€™t tell on him without getting my wife and
me into trouble. i beg you, sir, to say nothing to the police.â€

â€œwhat do you say, watson?â€

i shrugged my shoulders. â€œif he were safely out of the country it would
relieve the tax-payer of a burden.â€

â€œbut how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes?â€

â€œhe would not do anything so mad, sir. we have provided him with all
that he can want. to commit a crime would be to show where he was
hiding.â€

â€œthat is true,â€ said sir henry. â€œwell, barrymore--â€

â€œgod bless you, sir, and thank you from my heart! it would have killed
my poor wife had he been

â€œi guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, watson? but, after what
we have heard i donâ€™t feel as if i could give the man up, so there is an
end of it. all right, barrymore, you can go.â€

with a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he hesitated
and then came back.

â€œyouâ€™ve been so kind to us, sir, that i should like to do the best i
can for you in return. i know something, sir henry, and perhaps i should
have said it before, but it was long after the inquest that i found it
out. iâ€™ve never breathed a word about it yet to

up couldnâ€™t help our poor master, and itâ€™s well to go carefully when
thereâ€™s a lady in the case. even the best of us--â€

â€œyou thought it might injure his reputation?â€

â€œwell, sir, i thought no good could come of it. but now you have been
kind to us, and i feel as if it would be treating you unfairly not to
tell you all that i know about the matter.â€

â€œvery good, barrymore; you can go.â€ when the butler had left us sir
henry turned to me. â€œwell, watson, what do you think of this new light?â€

â€œit seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before.â€

â€œso i think. but if we can only trace l. l. it should clear up the whole
business. we have gained that much. we know that there is someone who
has the facts if we can only find her. what do you think we should do?â€

â€œlet holmes know all about it at once. it will give him the clue for
which he has been seeking. i am much mistaken if it does not bring him
down.â€

i went at once to m

missed him in london. it would indeed be a triumph for me if i could run
him to earth where my master had failed.

luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry, but now at
last it came to my aid. and the messenger of good fortune was none other
than mr. frankland, who was standing, gray-whiskered and red-faced,
outside the gate of his garden, which opened on to the highroad along
which i travelled.

â€œgood-day, dr. watson,â€ cried he with unwonted good humour, â€œyou must
really give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass of wine and
to congratulate me.â€

my feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after what i
had heard of his treatment of his daughter, but i was anxious to send
perkins and the wagonette home, and the opportunity was a good one. i
alighted and sent a message to sir henry that i should walk over in time
for dinner. then i followed frankland into his dining-room.

your suggestion, sir, is a most absurd one.â€

i meekly answered that i had spoken without knowing all the facts. my
submission pleased him and led him to further confidences.

opinion. i have seen the boy again and again with his bundle. every
day, and sometimes twice a day, i have been able--but wait a moment,
dr. watson. do my eyes deceive me, or is there at the present moment
something moving upon that hillside?â€

it was several miles off, but i could distinctly see a small dark dot
against the dull green and gray.

â€œcome, sir, come!â€ cried frankland, rushing upstairs. â€œyou will see with
your own eyes and judge for yourself.â€

the telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod, stood upon
the flat leads of the house. frankland clapped his eye to it and gave a
cry of satisfaction.

â€œquick

, dr. watson, quick, before he passes over the hill!â€

there he was, sure enough, a small urchin with a little bundle upon his
shoulder, toiling slowly up the hill. when he reached the crest i saw
the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue
sky. he looked round him with a furtive and stealthy air, as one who
dreads pursuit. then he vanished over the hill.

â€œwell! am i right?â€

â€œcertainly, there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand.â€

â€œand what the errand is e

orner. in the middle of
the hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table, and upon this stood
a small cloth bundle--the same, no doubt, which i had seen through the
telescope upon the shoulder of the boy. it contained a loaf of bread,
a tinned tongue, and two tins of preserved peaches. as i set it down
again, after having examined it, my heart leaped to see that beneath it
there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it. i raised it, and this
was what i read, roughly scrawled in pencil: â€œdr. watson has gone to
coombe tracey.â€

for a minute i stood there with the paper in my hands thinking out the
meaning of this curt message. it was i, then, and not sir henry, who was
being dogged by this secret man. he had not followed me himself, but
he had set an agent--the boy, perhaps--upon my track, and this was his
report. possibly i had taken no step since i had been upon the moor
which had not been observed and reported. always there was this feeling
of an unseen force, a fine net drawn round u

d then at last i heard him. far away came the sharp clink of a boot
striking upon a stone. then another and yet another, coming nearer and
nearer. i shrank back into the darkest corner and cocked the pistol in
my pocket, determined not to discover myself until i had an opportunity
of seeing something of the stranger. there was a long pause which showed
that he had stopped. then once more the footsteps approached and a
shadow fell across the opening of the hut.

â€œit is a lovely evening, my dear watson,â€ said a well-known voice. â€œi
really think that you will be more comfortable outside than in.â€




chapter 12. death on the moor



for a moment or two i sat breathless, hardly able to believe my ears.
then my senses and my voice came back to me, while a crushing weight
of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul. that
cold, incisive, ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the
world.

â€œholmes!â€ i cried--â€œholmes!â€

s characteristics, that his chin should be as smooth and his linen
as perfect as if he were in baker street.

â€œi never was more glad to see anyone in my life,â€ said i as i wrung him
by the hand.

â€œor more astonished, eh?â€

â€œwell, i must confess to it.â€

â€œthe surprise was not all on one side, i assure you. i had no idea that
you had found my occasional retreat, still less that you were inside it,
until i was within twenty paces of the door.â€

â€œmy footprint, i presume?â€

â€œno, watson, i fear that i could not undertake to recognize your
footprint amid all the footprints of the world. if you seriously desire
to deceive me you must change your tobacconist; for when i see the stub
of a cigarette marked bradley, oxford street, i know that my friend
watson is in the neighbourhood. you will see it there beside the path.
you threw it down, no doubt, at that supreme moment when you charged
into the empty hut.â€

â€œexactly.â€

â€œi thought as much--and knowing your admirable tenac

ity i was convinced
that you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach, waiting for the
tenant to return. so you actually thought that i was the criminal?â€

â€œi did not know who you were, but i was determined to find out.â€

â€œexcellent, watson! and how did you localize me? you saw me, perhaps, on
the night of the convict hunt, when i was so imprudent as to allow the
moon to rise behind me?â€

â€œyes, i saw you then.â€

â€œand have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one?â€

â€œno, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide where to
look.â€

â€œthe old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt. i could not make it out
when first i saw the light flashing upon the lens.â€ he rose and peeped
into the hut. â€

in?â€ i asked.

â€œthat is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed a
light. your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very
much. i did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her
husband. in that case, regarding stapleton as an unmarried man, she
counted no doubt upon becoming his wife.â€

â€œand when she is undeceived?â€

â€œwhy, then we may find the lady of service. it must be our first duty
to see her--both of us--tomorrow. donâ€™t you think, watson, that you are
away from your charge rather long? your place should be at baskerville
hall.â€

the last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had settled
upon the moor. a few faint stars were gleaming in a violet sky.

â€œone last question, holmes,â€ i said as i rose. â€œsurely there is no need
of secrecy between you and me. what is the meaning of it all? what is he
after?â€

holmesâ€™s voice sank as he answered:

â€œit is murder, watson--refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder. d

rk, athletic outline at
the door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head thrust forward,
his face peering into the darkness.

â€œhush!â€ he whispered. â€œhush!â€

the cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had pealed out
from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. now it burst upon our ears,
nearer, louder, more urgent than before.

â€œwhere is it?â€ holmes whispered; and i knew from the thrill of his voice
that he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul. â€œwhere is it, watson?â€

â€œthere, i think.â€ i pointed into the darkness.

â€œno, there!â€

again the agonized cry swept through the silent night, louder and much
nearer than ever. and a new sound mingled with it, a deep, muttered
rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling like the low,
constant murmur of the sea.

â€œthe hound!â€ cried holmes. â€œcome, watson, come! great heavens, if we are
too late!â€

he had started running swiftly over the moor, and i had followed at his
heels. but now from some

where among the broken ground immediately in
front of us there came one last despairing yell, and then a dull, heavy
thud. we halted and listened. not another sound broke the heavy silence
of the windless night.

i saw holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted. he
stamped his feet upon the ground.

â€œhe has beaten us, watson. we are too late.â€

â€œno, no, surely not!â€

â€œfool that i was to hold my hand. and you, watson, see what comes of
abandoning your charge! but, by heaven, if the worst has happened weâ€™ll
avenge him!â€

blindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders, forcing
our way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and rushing down slopes,
heading always in the direction whence those dreadful sounds had come.
at every rise holmes looked eagerly round him, but the shadows were
thick upon the moor, and nothing moved upon its dreary face.

â€œcan you see anything?â€

â€œnothing.â€

f us forgetting that peculiar ruddy tweed
suit--the very one which he had worn on the first morning that we had
seen him in baker street. we caught the one clear glimpse of it, and
then the match flickered and went out, even as the hope had gone out
of our souls. holmes groaned, and his face glimmered white through the
darkness.

â€œthe brute! the brute!â€ i cried with clenched hands. â€œoh holmes, i shall
never forgive myself for having left him to his fate.â€

â€œi am more to blame than you, watson. in order to have my case well
rounded and complete, i have thrown away the life of my client. it is
the greatest blow which has befallen me in my career. but how could i
know--how could i know--that he would risk his life alone upon the moor
in the face of all my warnings?â€

â€œthat we should have heard his screams--my god, those screams!--and yet
have been unable to save him! where is this brute of a hound which drove
him to his death? it may be lurking among these rocks at this instant.

â€œexactly. i have no doubt that you and i could carry it so far. halloa,
watson, whatâ€™s this? itâ€™s the man himself, by all thatâ€™s wonderful and
audacious! not a word to show your suspicions--not a word, or my plans
crumble to the ground.â€

a figure was approaching us over the moor, and i saw the dull red glow
of a cigar. the moon shone upon him, and i could distinguish the dapper
shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist. he stopped when he saw us, and
then came on again.

â€œwhy, dr. watson, thatâ€™s not you, is it? you are the last man that i
should have expected to see out on the moor at this time of night. but,
dear me, whatâ€™s this? somebody hurt? not--donâ€™t tell me that it is our
friend sir henry!â€ he hurried past me and stooped over the dead man. i
heard a sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fell from his fingers.

â€œwho--whoâ€™s this?â€ he stammered.

â€œit is selden, the man who escaped from princetown.â€

stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supr

â€œi have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his head.
he has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually fallen over
here and broken his neck.â€

â€œthat seems the most reasonable theory,â€ said stapleton, and he gave a
sigh which i took to indicate his relief. â€œwhat do you think about it,
mr. sherlock holmes?â€

my friend bowed his compliments. â€œyou are quick at identification,â€ said
he.

â€œwe have been expecting you in these parts since dr. watson came down.
you are in time to see a tragedy.â€

â€œyes, indeed. i have no doubt that my friendâ€™s explanation will cover
the facts. i will take an unpleasant remembrance back to london with me
tomorrow.â€

â€œoh, you return tomorrow?â€

â€œthat is my intention.â€

â€œi hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have
puzzled us?â€

holmes shrugged his shoulders.

worthy of our steel.â€

â€œi am sorry that he has seen you.â€

â€œand so was i at first. but there was no getting out of it.â€

â€œwhat effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows
you are here?â€

â€œit may cause him to be more cautious, or it may drive him to desperate
measures at once. like most clever criminals, he may be too confident in
his own cleverness and imagine that he has completely deceived us.â€

â€œwhy should we not arrest him at once?â€

â€œmy dear watson, you were born to be a man of action. your instinct is
always to do something energetic. but supposing, for argumentâ€™s sake,
that we had him arrested tonight, what on earth the better off should
we be for that? we could prove nothing against him. thereâ€™s the devilish
cunning of it! if he were acting through a human agent we could get some
evidence, but if we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it
would not help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master.â€

â€œsurely we

 it seemed
desirable that he should know. but first i had the unpleasant duty of
breaking the news to barrymore and his wife. to him it may have been an
unmitigated relief, but she wept bitterly in her apron. to all the world
he was the man of violence, half animal and half demon; but to her he
always remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood, the child who
had clung to her hand. evil indeed is the man who has not one woman to
mourn him.

â€œiâ€™ve been moping in the house all day since watson went off in the
morning,â€ said the baronet. â€œi guess i should have some credit, for i
have kept my promise. if i hadnâ€™t sworn not to go about alone i might
have had a more lively evening, for i had a message from stapleton
asking me over there.â€

â€œi have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening,â€ said
holmes drily. â€œby the way, i donâ€™t suppose you appreciate that we have
been mourning over you as having broken your neck?â€

sir henry opened his eyes. â€œhow was th

at?â€

â€œthis poor wretch was dressed in your clothes. i fear your servant who
gave them to him may get into trouble with the police.â€

â€œthat is unlikely. there was no mark on any of them, as far as i know.â€

â€œthatâ€™s lucky for him--in fact, itâ€™s lucky for all of you, since you are
all on the wrong side of the law in this matter. i am not sure that as
a conscientious detective my first duty is not to arrest the whole
household. watsonâ€™s reports are most incriminating documents.â€

â€œbut how about the case?â€ asked the baronet. â€œhave you made anything out
of the tangle? i donâ€™t know that watson and i are much the wiser since
we came down.â€

â€œi think that i shall be in a position to make the situation rather more
clear to you before long. it has been an exceedingly difficult and most
complicated business. there are several points upon which we still want
light--but it is coming all the same.â€

â€œweâ€™ve had one

hound on the moor, so i can swear that it is not all empty superstition.
i had something to do with dogs when i was out west, and i know one when
i hear one. if you can muzzle that one and put him on a chain iâ€™ll be
ready to swear you are the greatest detective of all time.â€

your help.â€

â€œbut this is marvellous. it might be his portrait.â€

to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation. the fellow is a

â€œwith designs upon the succession.â€

â€œexactly. this chance of the picture has supplied us with one of our
most obvious missing links. we have him, watson, we have him, and i dare

helpless as one of his own butterflies. a pin, a cork, and a card, and
we add him to the baker street collection!â€ he burst into one of his
rare fits of laughter as he turned away from the picture. i have not
heard him laugh often, and it has always boded ill to somebody.

i was up betimes in the morning, but holmes was afoot earlier still, for
i saw him as i dressed, coming up the drive.

â€œwhat is the next move?â€

â€œto see sir henry. ah, here he is!â€

â€œgood-morning, holmes,â€ said the baronet. â€œyou look like a general who
is planning a battle with his chief of the staff.â€

â€œthat is the exact situation. watson was asking for orders.â€

â€œand so do i.â€

â€œvery good. you are engaged, as i understand, to dine with our friends
the stapletons tonight.â€

â€œi hope that you will come also. they are very hospitable people, and i
am sure that they would be very glad to see you.â€

â€œi fear that watson and i must go to london.â€

â€œto london?â€

â€œyes, i think that we should be more useful there at the present
juncture.â€

the baronetâ€™s face perceptibly lengthened.

the boy returned with a telegram, which holmes handed to me. it ran:

â€œthat is in answer to mine of this morning. he is the best of the
professionals, i think, and we may need his assistance. now, watson, i
think that we cannot employ our time better than by calling upon your
acquaintance, mrs. laura lyons.â€

his plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. he would use the
baronet in order to convince the stapletons that we were really gone,
while we should actually return at the instant when we were likely to
be needed. that telegram from london, if mentioned by sir henry to the
stapletons, must remove the last suspicions from their minds. already i

mrs. laura lyons was in her office, and sherlock holmes opened his
interview with a frankness and directness which considerably amazed her.

â€œi am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the
late sir charles baskerville,â€ said he. â€œmy friend here, dr. watson,
has informed me of what you have communicated, and also of what you have
withheld in connection with that matter.â€

â€œwhat have i withheld?â€ she asked defiantly.

â€œyou have confessed that you asked sir charles to be at the gate at ten
oâ€™clock. we know that that was the place and hour of his death. you have
withheld what the connection is between these events.â€

â€œthere is no connection.â€

â€œin that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one. but

to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper.â€

we moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the house,
but holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards from it.

â€œthis will do,â€ said he. â€œthese rocks upon the right make an admirable
screen.â€

â€œwe are to wait here?â€

â€œyes, we shall make our little ambush here. get into this hollow,
lestrade. you have been inside the house, have you not, watson? can you
tell the position of the rooms? what are those latticed windows at this
end?â€

â€œi think they are the kitchen windows.â€

â€œand the one beyond, which shines so brightly?â€

â€œthat is certainly the dining-room.â€

â€œthe blinds are up. you know the lie of the land best. creep forward
quietly and see what they are doing--but for heavenâ€™s sake donâ€™t let
them know that they are watched!â€

i tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which surrounded
the stunted orc

 path on the other side of the wall
under which i crouched. looking over, i saw the naturalist pause at the
door of an out-house in the corner of the orchard. a key turned in
a lock, and as he passed in there was a curious scuffling noise from
within. he was only a minute or so inside, and then i heard the key turn
once more and he passed me and reentered the house. i saw him rejoin his
guest, and i crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to
tell them what i had seen.

â€œyou say, watson, that the lady is not there?â€ holmes asked when i had
finished my report.

â€œno.â€

â€œwhere can she be, then, since there is no light in any other room
except the kitchen?â€

â€œi cannot think where she is.â€

i have said that over the great grimpen mire there hung a dense, white
fog. it was drifting slowly in our direction and banked itself up like a
wall on that side of us, low but thick and well defined. the moon shone
on it, and it looked like a great shimmering ice-field, with the h

of the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface. holmesâ€™s face
was turned towards it, and he muttered impatiently as he watched its
sluggish drift.

â€œitâ€™s moving towards us, watson.â€

â€œis that serious?â€

â€œvery serious, indeed--the one thing upon earth which could have
disarranged my plans. he canâ€™t be very long, now. it is already ten
oâ€™clock. our success and even his life may depend upon his coming out
before the fog is over the path.â€

the night was clear and fine above us. the stars shone cold and bright,
while a half-moon bathed the whole scene in a soft, uncertain light.

and by the
desire to frighten old sir charles to death. no wonder the poor devil of
a convict ran and screamed, even as our friend did, and as we ourselves
might have done, when he saw such a creature bounding through the
darkness of the moor upon his track. it was a cunning device, for, apart
from the chance of driving your victim to his death, what peasant would
venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight
of it, as many have done, upon the moor? i said it in london, watson,
and i say it again now, that never yet have we helped to hunt down a
more dangerous man than he who is lying yonderâ€--he swept his long arm
towards the huge mottled expanse of green-splotched bog which stretched
away until it merged into the russet slopes of the moor.

sir henry, and he hoped, no doubt, that when the whole countryside put
down the baronetâ€™s death to the curse of his family, as they certainly
would do, he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished fact and
to keep silent upon what she knew. in this i fancy that in any case
he made a miscalculation, and that, if we had not been there, his doom
would none the less have been sealed. a woman of spanish blood does
not condone such an injury so lightly. and now, my dear watson, without
referring to my notes, i cannot give you a more detailed account of
this curious case. i do not know that anything essential has been left
unexplained.â€

â€œhe could not hope to frighten sir henry to death as he had done the old
uncle with his bogie hound.â€

â€œthe beast was savage and half-starved. if its appearance did not
frighten its victim to death, at least it would paralyze the resistance
which might be offered.â€

â€œno doubt. there only remains one difficulty. if stapleto

accomplice with the proofs and papers, putting him in as heir, and
retaining a claim upon some proportion of his income. we cannot doubt
from what we know of him that he would have found some way out of the
difficulty. and now, my dear watson, we have had some weeks of severe
work, and for one evening, i think, we may turn our thoughts into more
pleasant channels. i have a box for â€˜les huguenots.â€™ have you heard the
