rooding gloom.

between us there was, as i have already said somewhere, the bond of
the sea. besides holding our hearts together through long periods of
separation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other’s
yarns--and even convictions. the lawyer--the best of old fellows--had,
because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck,
and was lying on the only rug. the accountant had brought out already a
box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. marlow
sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. he had
sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect,
and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an
idol. the director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way
aft and sat down amongst us. we exchanged a few words lazily. afterwards
there was silence on board the yacht. for some reason or other we did
not begin that game of dominoes. we felt meditative, and fit for nothing

the sun set; the dusk fell on the stream, and lights began to appear
along the shore. the chapman light-house, a three-legged thing erect
on a mud-flat, shone strongly. lights of ships moved in the fairway--a
great stir of lights going up and going down. and farther west on the
upper reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked ominously
on the sky, a brooding gloom in sunshine, a lurid glare under the stars.

“and this also,” said marlow suddenly, “has been one of the dark places
of the earth.”

he was the only man of us who still “followed the sea.” the worst that
could be said of him was that he did not represent his class. he was a
seaman, but he was a wanderer, too, while most seamen lead, if one may
so express it, a sedentary life. their minds are of the stay-at-home
order, and their home is always with them--the ship; and so is their
country--the sea. one ship is very much like another, and the sea is
always the s

tery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance;
for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself,
which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as destiny.
for the rest, after his hours of work, a casual stroll or a casual spree
on shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent,
and generally he finds the secret not worth knowing. the yarns of seamen
have a direct simplicity, the whole meaning of which lies within the
shell of a cracked nut. but marlow was not typical (if his propensity
to spin yarns be excepted), and to him the meaning of an episode was not
inside like a kernel but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it
out only as a glow brings out a haze, in the likeness of one of these
misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination
of moonshine.

his remark did not seem at all surprising. it was just like marlow.
it was accepted in silence. no one took the trouble to grunt even; and
presently he said, very

 pursuing, overtaking, joining, crossing each
other--then separating slowly or hastily. the traffic of the great city
went on in the deepening night upon the sleepless river. we looked on,
waiting patiently--there was nothing else to do till the end of
the flood; but it was only after a long silence, when he said, in
a hesitating voice, “i suppose you fellows remember i did once turn
fresh-water sailor for a bit,” that we knew we were fated, before
the ebb began to run, to hear about one of marlow’s inconclusive
experiences.

“i don’t want to bother you much with what happened to me personally,”
 he began, showing in this remark the weakness of many tellers of tales
who seem so often unaware of what their audience would like best to
hear; “yet to understand the effect of it on me you ought to know how i
got out there, what i saw, how i went up that river to the place where i
first met the poor chap. it was the farthest point of navigation and the
culminating point of my experie

and not so nasty as it looks, they say.

“i am sorry to own i began to worry them. this was already a fresh
departure for me. i was not used to get things that way, you know. i
always went my own road and on my own legs where i had a mind to go. i
wouldn’t have believed it of myself; but, then--you see--i felt somehow
i must get there by hook or by crook. so i worried them. the men said
‘my dear fellow,’ and did nothing. then--would you believe it?--i tried
the women. i, charlie marlow, set the women to work--to get a job.
heavens! well, you see, the notion drove me. i had an aunt, a dear
enthusiastic soul. she wrote: ‘it will be delightful. i am ready to do
anything, anything for you. it is a glorious idea. i know the wife of a
very high personage in the administration, and also a man who has lots
of influence with,’ etc. she was determined to make no end of fuss to
get me appointed skipper of a river steamboat, if such was my fancy.

“i got my appointment--of course;

ecome so pitch dark that we listeners could hardly see one
another. for a long time already he, sitting apart, had been no more
to us than a voice. there was not a word from anybody. the others might
have been asleep, but i was awake. i listened, i listened on the watch
for the sentence, for the word, that would give me the clue to the
faint uneasiness inspired by this narrative that seemed to shape itself
without human lips in the heavy night-air of the river.

“... yes--i let him run on,” marlow began again, “and think what
he pleased about the powers that were behind me. i did! and there was
nothing behind me! there was nothing but that wretched, old, mangled
steamboat i was leaning against, while he talked fluently about ‘the
necessity for every man to get on.’ ‘and when one comes out here, you
conceive, it is not to gaze at the moon.’ mr. kurtz was a ‘universal
genius,’ but even a genius would find it easier to work with ‘adequate
tools--intelligent men.’ he did no

out for the signs of dead wood we could cut up in the night
for next day’s steaming. when you have to attend to things of that sort,
to the mere incidents of the surface, the reality--the reality, i tell
you--fades. the inner truth is hidden--luckily, luckily. but i felt it
all the same; i felt often its mysterious stillness watching me at
my monkey tricks, just as it watches you fellows performing on your
respective tight-ropes for--what is it? half-a-crown a tumble--”

“try to be civil, marlow,” growled a voice, and i knew there was at
least one listener awake besides myself.

“i beg your pardon. i forgot the heartache which makes up the rest of
the price. and indeed what does the price matter, if the trick be well
done? you do your tricks very well. and i didn’t do badly either, since
i managed not to sink that steamboat on my first trip. it’s a wonder to
me yet. imagine a blindfolded man set to drive a van over a bad road.

emotion, even such as i had noticed in the howling sorrow of these
savages in the bush. i couldn’t have felt more of lonely desolation
somehow, had i been robbed of a belief or had missed my destiny in
life.... why do you sigh in this beastly way, somebody? absurd? well,
absurd. good lord! mustn’t a man ever--here, give me some tobacco.”...

there was a pause of profound stillness, then a match flared, and
marlow’s lean face appeared, worn, hollow, with downward folds and
dropped eyelids, with an aspect of concentrated attention; and as he
took vigorous draws at his pipe, it seemed to retreat and advance out of
the night in the regular flicker of tiny flame. the match went out.

“absurd!” he cried. “this is the worst of trying to tell.... here
you all are, each moored with two good addresses, like a hulk with
two anchors, a butcher round one corner, a policeman round another,

 sure!’... she knew. she was
sure. i heard her weeping; she had hidden her face in her hands. it
seemed to me that the house would collapse before i could escape, that
the heavens would fall upon my head. but nothing happened. the heavens
do not fall for such a trifle. would they have fallen, i wonder, if i
had rendered kurtz that justice which was his due? hadn’t he said he
wanted only justice? but i couldn’t. i could not tell her. it would have
been too dark--too dark altogether....”

marlow ceased, and sat apart, indistinct and silent, in the pose of a
meditating buddha. nobody moved for a time. “we have lost the first of
the ebb,” said the director suddenly. i raised my head. the offing was
barred by a black bank of clouds, and the tranquil waterway leading to
the uttermost ends of the earth flowed sombre under an overcast
sky--seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness.
