Theodore Hickman  - 
      A salesman. Immediately likable, Hickey speaks like a salesman with an "easy flow of glib, persuasive convincingness." His shrewd eyes can take in anyone at a glance, thus his immediate intuition that he and Parritt have something in common. Hickey is the saloon's anxiously-awaited guest, his arrival promising free drinks and merriment. However, this time the group's "messiah," so to speak, comes bearing a different gospel of salvation, urging them to divest themselves of their pipe dreams and finally make peace with themselves. Hickey's murder of the tomorrow dreams will bring ruin the bar, thus Hickey is the "Iceman," or Death.
