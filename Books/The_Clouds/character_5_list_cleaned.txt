[CHARACTER] - 
      a personified school of thought. [CHARACTER] is un[CHARACTER]'s necessary foil. he, like strepsiades, represents the "old" or "traditional" system of education, one that stressed obedience, reverence for one's elders, values indoctrinated in martial poetry such as homer, and physical fitness. however, like strepsiades, [CHARACTER]'s overdeveloped sense of the physical will be his undoing: his own over-zealous sexual appetite undermines the moral content in his argument, making him into a foolish pederast and not a wise pedagogue.
