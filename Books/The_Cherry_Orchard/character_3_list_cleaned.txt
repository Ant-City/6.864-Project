[CHARACTER] - 
      [CHARACTER] is ranevksy's adopted daughter, who is twenty-four years old. she is in love with lopakhin, but she doubts that he will ever propose to her. [CHARACTER] is hard-working and responsible and has a similar work ethic to lopakhin. she is also something of cry-baby, often in tears; but this may reflect her sense of powerlessness, as she is the one character in the play who may be most affected by the loss of the estate. she is the estate's manager, so she will lose her job if ranevsky loses the estate, but, lacking money or a husband, she has no control over its fate or her own.
