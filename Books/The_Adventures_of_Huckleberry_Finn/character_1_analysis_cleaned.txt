[CHARACTER]
tom is the same age as huck and his best friend. whereas
huck's birth and upbringing have left him in poverty and on the
margins of society, tom has been raised in relative comfort. as
a result, his beliefs are an unfortunate combination of what he
has learned from the adults around him and the fanciful notions
he has gleaned from reading romance and adventure novels. tom believes
in sticking strictly to "rules," most of which have more to do with
style than with morality or anyone's welfare. tom is thus the perfect
foil for huck: his rigid adherence to rules and precepts contrasts
with huck's tendency to question authority and think for himself.

although tom's escapades are often funny, they also show
just how disturbingly and unthinkingly cruel society can be. tom
knows all along that miss watson has died and that jim is now a
free man, yet he is willing to allow jim to remain a captive while
he entertains himself with fantastic escape plans. tom's plotting
tortures not only jim, but aunt sally and uncle silas as well. in
the end, although he is just a boy like huck and is appealing in
his zest for adventure and his unconscious wittiness, tom embodies
what a young, well-to-do white man is raised to become in the society
of his time: self-centered with dominion over all.
