it was early may. in some of the gardens the fruit trees were encircled with dense 
clusters of daffodils. the birches were already in pale green leaf.
it was extraordinary how everything burst forth at this time of year! what made this
great mass of green vegetation come welling up from the dead earth as soon as it got
warm and the last traces of snow disappeared?
as sophie opened her garden gate, she looked in the mailbox. there was usually a lot
of junk mail and a few big envelopes for her mother, a pile to dump on the kitchen
table before she went up to her room to start her homework.
from time to time there would be a few letters from the bank for her father, but then
he was not a normal father. sophie's father was the captain of a big oil tanker, and was
away for most of the year. during the few weeks at a time when he was at home, he
would shuffle around the house making it nice and cozy for sophie and her mother.
but when he was at sea he could seem very distant.
there was only one

ntained only a slip of paper no bigger than the envelope. it read: who are you?
nothing else, only the three words, written by hand, and followed by a large question
mark.
she looked at the envelope again. the letter was definitely for her. who could have
dropped it in the mailbox?
sophie let herself quickly into the red house. as always, her cat sherekan managed to
slink out of the bushes, jump onto the front step, and slip in through the door before
she closed it behind her.
whenever sophie's mother was in a bad mood, she would call the house they lived in
a menagerie. a menagerie was a collection of animals. sophie certainly had one and
was quite happy with it. it had begun with the three goldfish, goldtop, red
ridinghood, and black jack. next she got two budgerigars called smitt and smule,
then govinda the tortoise, and finally the marmalade cat sherekan. they had all been 
given to her to make up for the fact that her mother never got home from work until
late in the afternoon and her f

rs were much too close to her eyes. worst of all was her straight hair, which it was
impossible to do anything with. sometimes her father would stroke her hair and call
her "the girl with the flaxen hair," after a piece of music by claude debussy. it was all
right for him, he was not condemned to living with this straight dark hair. neither
mousse nor styling gel had the slightest effect on sophie's hair. sometimes she
thought she was so ugly that she wondered if she was malformed at birth. her mother
always went on about her difficult labor. but was that really what determined how
you looked?
wasn't it odd that she didn't know who she was? and wasn't it unreasonable that she
hadn't been allowed to have any say in what she would look like? her looks had just
been dumped on her. she could choose her own friends, but she certainly hadn't
chosen herself. she had not even chosen to be a human being.
what was a human being?
sophie looked up at the girl in the mirror again.

bushes. a live cat, vibrant with energy from its white whiskers to the twitching tail at
the end of its sleek body. it was here in the garden too, but hardly aware of it in the
same way as sophie. 
as sophie started to think about being alive, she began to realize that she would not
be alive forever. i am in the world now, she thought, but one day i shall be gone.
was there a life after death? this was another question the cat was blissfully unaware
of.
it was not long since sophie's grandmother had died. for more than six months
sophie had missed her every single day. how unfair that life had to end!
sophie stood on the gravel path, thinking. she tried to think extra hard about being
alive so as to forget that she would not be alive forever. but it was impossible. as
soon as she concentrated on being alive now, the thought of dying also came into her
mind. the same thing happened the other way around: only by conjuring up an
intense feeling of one day being dead could she appreciate h

er there.
clutching the two envelopes in her hand, sophie ran through the garden, crouched
down on all fours, and wormed her way through the hedge. the den was almost high
enough for her to stand upright, but today she sat down on a clump of gnarled roots.
from there she could look out through tiny peepholes between the twigs and leaves.
although none of the holes was bigger than a small coin, she had a good view of the
whole garden. when she was little she used to think it was fun to watch her mother 
and father searching for her among the trees.
sophie had always thought the garden was a world of its own. each time she heard
about the garden of eden in the bible it reminded her of sitting here in the den,
surveying her own little paradise.
where does the world come from?
she hadn't the faintest idea. sophie knew that the world was only a small planet in
space. but where did space come from?
it was possible that space had always existed, in which case she would not also need
to figure out w

e opened the two envelopes again.
who are you?
where does the world come from? 
what annoying questions! and anyway where did the letters come from? that was
just as mysterious, almost.
who had jolted sophie out of her everyday existence and suddenly brought her face to
face with the great riddles of the universe?
for the third time sophie went to the mailbox. the mailman had just delivered the
day's mail. sophie fished out a bulky pile of junk mail, periodicals, and a couple of
letters for her mother. there was also a postcard of a tropical beach. she turned the
card over. it had a nor-wegian stamp on it and was postmarked "un battalion."
could it be from dad? but wasn't he in a completely different place? it wasn't his
handwriting either.
sophie felt her pulse quicken a little as she saw who the postcard was addressed to:
"hilde moller knag, c/o sophie amundsen, 3 clover close ..." the rest of the address
was correct. the card read:
dear hilde, happy 15th birthday! as i'm sure you'll under

 appointment.
sophie regretted having been mean to her. but what else could she have said? that
she had suddenly become so engrossed in who she was and where the world came
from that she had no time to play badminton? would joanna have understood?
why was it so difficult to be absorbed in the most vital and, in a way, the most natural
of all questions?
she felt her heart beating faster as she opened the mailbox. at first she found only a
letter from the bank and some big brown envelopes for her mother. darn! sophie had
been looking forward to getting another letter from the unknown sender.
as she closed the gate behind her she noticed her own name on one of the big
envelopes. turning it over, she saw written on the back: "course in philosophy.
handle with care."
sophie ran up the gravel path and flung her schoolbag onto the step. stuffing the other
letters under the doormat, she ran around into the back garden and sought refuge in
the den. this was the only place to open the big letter.

are you still there, sophie? to be continued . . .
sophie was completely exhausted. still there? she could not even remember if she
had taken the time to breathe while she read.
who had brought this letter? it couldn't be the same person who had sent the birthday
card to hilde moller knag because that card had both a stamp and a postmark. the
brown envelope had been delivered by hand to the mailbox exactly like the two white
ones.
sophie looked at her watch. it was a quarter to three. her mother would not be home
from work for over two hours.
sophie crawled out into the garden again and ran to the mailbox. perhaps there was
another letter. 
she found one more brown envelope with her name on it. this time she looked all
around but there was nobody in sight. sophie ran to the edge of the woods and looked
down the path.
no one was there. suddenly she thought she heard a twig snap deep in the woods. but
she was not completely sure, and anyway it would be pointless to chase after someone

when sophie's mother got home later that afternoon, sophie was practically in shock.
the tin containing the letters from the mysterious philosopher was safely hidden in
the den. sophie had tried to start her homework but could only sit thinking about what
she had read.
she had never thought so hard before! she was no longer a child--but she wasn't
really grown up either. sophie realized that she had already begun to crawl down into
the cozy rabbit's fur, the very same rabbit that had been pulled from the top hat of

the philosopher had rescued her. no doubt about it. the unknown letter writer had
saved her from the triviality of everyday existence.
when mom got home at five o'clock, sophie dragged her into the living room and
pushed her into an armchair.
"mom--don't you think it's astonishing to be alive?" she began.
her mother was so surprised that she didn't answer at first. sophie was usually doing
her homework when she got home.
"i suppose i do--sometimes," she said.
"sometimes? yes, but--don't you think it's astonishing that the world exists at all?"
"now look, sophie. stop talking like that."
"why? perhaps you think the world is quite normal?"
 "well, isn't it? more or less, anyway." 
sophie saw that the philosopher was right. grownups took the world for granted.
they had let themselves be lulled into the enchan

"i'm talking about you getting so used to everything. totally dim, in other words."
"i will not be spoken to like that, sophie!"
"all right, i'll put it another way. you've made yourself comfortable deep down in the
fur of a white rabbit that is being pulled out of the universe's top hat right now. and in
a minute you'll put the potatoes on. then you'll read the paper and after half an hour's
nap you'll watch the news on tv!"
an anxious expression came over her mother's face. she did indeed go into the
kitchen and put the potatoes on. after a while she came back into the living room, and
this time it was she who pushed sophie into an armchair.
"there's something i must talk to you about," she began. sophie could tell by her
voice that it was something serious.
"you haven't gotten yourself mixed up with drugs, have you, dear?"
sophie was just about to laugh, but she understood why the question was being
brought up now.
"are you nuts?" she said. "that only mak

sophie liked her beautiful story. if she had not known any other explanation for the
changing seasons, she felt sure she would have come to believe her own story in the
end.
she understood that people had always felt a need to explain the processes of nature. 
perhaps they could not live without such explanations. and that they made up all
those myths in the time before there was anything called science.

... nothing can come from nothing ...
when her mother got home from work that afternoon sophie was sitting in the glider,
pondering the possible connection between the philosophy course and hilde moller
knag, who would not be getting a birthday card from her father.
her mother called from the other end of the garden, "sophie! there's a letter for you!"
she caught her breath. she had already emptied the mailbox, so the letter had to be
from the philosopher. what on earth would she say to her mother?
"there's no stamp on it. it's probably a love let

ter!"
sophie took the letter.
"aren't you going to open it?"
she had to find an excuse.
"have you ever heard of anyone opening a love letter with her mother looking over
her shoulder?"
let her mother think it was a love letter. although it was embarrassing enough, it
would be even worse if her mother found out that she was doing a correspondence
course with a complete stranger, a philosopher who was playing hide-and-seek with
her.
it was one of the little white envelopes. when sophie got upstairs to her room, she
found three new questions:
is there a basic substance that everything else is made of?
can water turn into wine? how can earth and water produce a live frog! 
sophie found the questions pretty stupid, but nevertheless they kept buzzing around in
her head all evening. she was still

ays a lot of
people imagine that at some time something must have come from nothing. this idea
was not so widespread among the greeks. for one reason or another, they assumed
that "something" had always existed.
how everything could come from nothing was therefore not the all-important
question. on the other hand the greeks marveled at how live fish could come from
water, and huge trees and brilliantly colored flowers could come from the dead earth.
not to mention how a baby could come from its mother's womb!
the philosophers observed with their own eyes that nature was in a constant state of 
transformation. but how could such transformations occur?
how could something change from being substance to being a living thing, for
example?
all the earliest philosophers shared the belief that there had to be a certain basic
substance at the root of all change. how they arrived at this idea is hard to say. we
only know that the notion gradually evolved that there must be a basic substance that

by using her own common sense--without having to remember everything she had
learned at school. she decided that philosophy was not something you can learn; but
perhaps you can learn to think philosophically.

...the most ingenious toy in the world...
sophie put all the typed pages from the unknown philosopher back into the cookie tin
and put the lid on it. she crawled out of the den and stood for a while looking across
the garden. she thought about what happened yesterday. her mother had teased her
about the "love letter" again at breakfast this morning. she walked quickly over to the
mailbox to prevent the same thing from happening today. getting a love letter two
days in a row would be doubly embarrassing.
there was another little white envelope! sophie began to discern a pattern in the
deliveries: every afternoon she would find a big brown envelope. while she read the
contents, the philosopher would sneak up to the mailbox with another little white
envelope.
so now sophi

st thing about them was that with lego she could
construct any kind of object. and then she could separate the blocks and construct
something new.
what more could one ask of a toy? sophie decided that lego really could be called
the most ingenious toy in the world. but what it had to do with philosophy was
beyond her.
she had nearly finished constructing a big doll's house. much as she hated to admit it,
she hadn't had as much fun in ages.
why did people quit playing when they grew up?
when her mother got home and saw what sophie had been doing, she blurted out,
"what fun! i'm so glad you're not too grown up to play!"
"i'm not playing!" sophie retorted indignantly, "i'm doing a very complicated
philosophical experiment!"
her mother signed deeply. she was probably thinking about the white rabbit and the
top hat.
when sophie got home from school the following day, there were several more pages
for her in a big brown envelope. she took them upstairs to her room. she could not
wait to read them,

enough--it was addressed to sophie amundsen.
so he had tricked her! today of all days, when she had kept such careful watch on the
mailbox, the mystery man had sneaked up to the house from a different angle and just
laid the letter on the step before making off into the woods again. drat!
how did he know that sophie was watching the mailbox today? had he seen her at
the window? anyway, she was glad to find the letter before her mother arrived.
sophie went back to her room and opened the letter. the white envelope was a bit wet
around the edges, and had two little holes in it. why was that? it had not rained for
several days.
the little note inside read:
do you believe in fate?
is sickness the punishment of the gods?
what forces govern the course of history?
did she believe in fate? she was not at all sure. but she knew a lot of people who did.

the problem was where to put it so her mother didn't find it. she would have to wait
for her to get home before putting it in the mailbox. and she would also have to
remember to look in the mailbox early the next morning before the newspaper arrived.
if no new letter came for her this evening or during the night, she would have to take
the pink envelope in again.
why did it all have to be so complicated?
that evening sophie went up to her room early, even though it was friday. her
mother tried to tempt her with pizza and a thriller on tv, 
 
 ___________________________
 
but sophie said she was tired
and wanted to go to bed and read. while her mother sat watching tv, she sneaked out
to the mailbox with her letter.
her mother was clearly worried. she had started speaking to sophie in a different tone
since the business with the white rabbit and the top hat. sophie hated to be a worry to
her mother, but she just had to go upstairs and keep an eye on the mailbox.
when her mother came up at about eleven o'clock, sophie was sitting at the window
staring down the road.
"you're not still sitting there staring at the mailbox!" she said.
"i can look at whatever i like."
"i really think you must be in love, sophie. but if he is going to bring you another
letter, he certainly won't come in the middle of the night."
yuck! sophie loathed all that soppy talk about love. but she had to let her mother go
on believing it was true. 
"is he the one who told you about the rabbit and th

e top hat?" her mother asked.
sophie nodded.
"he--he doesn't do drugs, does he?"
now sophie felt really sorry for her mother. she couldn't go on letting her worry this
way, although it was completely nutty of her to think that just because someone had a
slightly bizarre idea he must be on something. grownups really were idiotic
sometimes.
she said, "mom, i promise you once and for all i'll never do any of that stuff... and he
doesn't either. but he is very interested in philosophy."
"is he older than you?"
sophie shook her head.
"the same age?"
sophie nodded.
"well, i'm sure he's very sweet, darling. now i think you

n pages from under
the bed. but what was that? right by the wall there was something red. a scarf,
perhaps?
sophie edged herself in under the bed and pulled out a red silk scarf. it wasn't hers,
that was for sure! 
she examined it more closely and gasped when she saw hilde written in ink along
the seam.
hilde! but who was hilde? how could their paths keep crossing like this?
socrates...wisest is she who knows she does not know...
sophie put on a summer dress and hurried down to the kitchen. her mother was
standing by the kitchen table. sophie decided not to say anything about the silk scarf.
"did you bring in the newspaper?" she asked.
her mother turned.
"would you get it for me?"
sophie was out of the door in a flash, down the gravel path to the mailbox.
only the newspaper. she couldn't expect an answer so soon, she supposed. on the
front page of the paper she read something about the norwegian un battalion in
lebanon.

ather? but the
postage stamp had been norwegian. maybe the norwegian un soldiers had their own
post office with them.
"you've become very interested in the newspaper," said her mother drily when sophie
returned to the kitchen.
luckily her mother said no more about mailboxes and stuff, either during breakfast or
later on that day. when she went shopping, sophie took her letter about fate down to
the den.
she was surprised to see a little white envelope beside the cookie tin with the other
letters from the philosopher. sophie was quite sure she had not put it there.
this envelope was also wet around the edges. and it had a couple of deep holes in it, 
just like the one she had received yesterday.
had the philosopher been here? did he kno
 
 ___________________________
 
that wasn't so difficult to agree with. sophie
had never thought about it before. but the more she did, the more clearly she saw that
knowing what you don't know is also a kind of knowledge. the stupidest thing she
knew was for people to act like they knew all about things they knew absolutely
nothing about.
the next sentence was about true insight coming from within. but didn't all
knowledge come into people's heads from the outside? on the other hand, sophie
could remember situations when her mother or the teachers at school had tried to
teach her something that she hadn't been receptive to. and whenever she had really
learned something, it was when she had somehow contributed to it herself. now and
then, even, she would suddenly understand a thing she'd drawn a total blank on before.
that was probably what people meant by "insight."
so far, so good. sophie thought she had done reasonably well on the first three
questions. but the next statement was so odd she couldn't help smiling: "he wh

discussed.
obviously he would not have become a famous philosopher had he confined himself
purely to listening to others. nor would he have been sentenced to death. but he just
asked questions, especially to begin a conversation, as if he knew nothing. in the
course of the discussion he would generally get his opponents to recognize the
weakness of their arguments, and, forced into a corner, they would finally be obliged
to realize what was right and what was wrong.
socrates, whose mother was a midwife, used to say that his art was like the art of the
midwife. she does not herself give birth to the child, but she is there to help during its
delivery. similarly, socrates saw his task as helping people to "give birth" to the
correct insight, since real understanding must come from within. it cannot be imparted
by someone else. and only the understanding that comes from within can lead to true
insight.
let me put it more precisely: the ability to give birth is a natural characteris

right. because why would anybody choose to be
unhappy?
what do you think, sophie? can you live a happy life if you continually do things you
know deep down are wrong? there are lots of people who lie and cheat and speak ill
of others. are they aware that these things are not right--or fair, if you prefer? do you
think these people are happy?
socrates didn't.
when sophie had read the letter, she quickly put it in the cookie tin and crawled out
into the garden. she wanted to go indoors before her mother got back with the
shopping in order to avoid any questions about where she had been. and she had
promised to do the dishes. 
she had just filled the sink with water when her mother came staggering in with two
huge shopping bags. perhaps that was why her mother said, "you are rather
preoccupied these days, sophie."
sophie didn't know why she said it; the words just tumbled out of her mouth: "so was
socrates."
"socrates?"
her mother stared at her, wide-eyed.
"it was just so sad that he had to die

 as a result," sophie went on thoughtfully.
"my goodness! sophie! i don't know what i'm to do!"
"neither did socrates. all he knew was that he knew nothing. and yet he was the
cleverest person in athens."
her mother was speechless.
finally she said, "is this something you've learned at school?"
sophie shook her head energetically.
"we don't learn anything there. the difference between schoolteachers and
philosophers is that school-teachers think they know a lot of stuff that they try to force
down our throats. philosophers try to figure things out together with the pupils."
"now we're back to white rabbits again! you know something? i demand to know
who your boyfriend really is. otherwise i'll begin to thi

nk he is a bit disturbed."
sophie turned her back on the dishes and pointed at her mother with the dish mop.
"it's not him who's disturbed. but he likes to disturb others--to shake them out of their
rut."
"that's enough of that! i think he sounds a bit too impertinent." sophie turned back to
the dishes. 
"he is neither impertinent nor pertinent," said sophie. "but he is trying to reach real
wisdom. that's the great difference between a real joker and all the other cards in the
deck."
"did you say joker?"
sophie nodded. "have you ever thought about the fact that there are a lot of he

arts and
diamonds in a pack of cards? and a lot of spades and clubs. but there's only one
joker."
"good grief, how you talk back, sophie!"
"and how you ask!"
her mother had put all the groceries away. now she took the newspaper and went into
the living room. sophie thought she closed the door more loudly than usual.
sophie finished doing the dishes and went upstairs to her room. she had put the red
silk scarf on the top shelf of the closet with the lego blocks. she took it down and
examined it carefully.

e start that her philosophy teacher was eccentric. but when he
started to use teaching methods that defied all the laws of nature, sophie thought he
was going too far.
had she really seen socrates and plato on tv? of course not, that was impossible.
but it definitely wasn't a cartoon.
sophie took the cassette out of the video recorder and ran up to her room with it. she
put it on the top shelf with all the lego blocks. then she sank onto the bed, exhausted,
and fell asleep.
some hours later her mother came into the room. she shook sophie gently and said:
"what's the matter, sophie?"
"mmmm?"
"you've gone to sleep with all your clothes on!"
sophie blinked her eyes sleepily.
"i've been to athens," she mumbled. that was all she could manage to say as she
turned over and went back to sleep.

sophie woke with a start early the next morning. she glanced at the clock. it was only
a little after five but she was so wide awake that she sat up in

 bed. why was she
wearing a dress? then she remembered everything. 
she climbed onto a stool and looked on the top shelf of the closet. yes--there, at the
back, was the video cassette. it hadn't been a dream after all; at least, not all of it.
but she couldn't really have seen plato and socrates ... oh, never mind! she didn't
have the energy to think about it any more. perhaps her mother was right, perhaps she
was acting a bit nuts these days.
anyway, she couldn't go back to sleep. perhaps she ought to go down to the den and
see if the dog had left another letter. sophie crept downstairs, put on a pair of jogging
shoes, and went out.
in the garden everything was wonderfully clear and still. the birds were chirping so
energetically that sophie could hardly keep from laughing. the morning dew
twinkled in the grass like drops of crystal. once again she was struck by the incredible

wonder of the world.
inside the old hedge it was also very damp. sophie saw no new letter from the
philosopher, but nevertheless she wiped off one of the thick roots and sat down.
she recalled that the video-plato had given her some questions to answer. the first
was something about how a baker could bake fifty identical cookies.
sophie had to think very carefully about that, because it definitely wouldn't be easy.
when her mother occasionally baked a batch of cookies, they were never all exactly
the same. but then she was not an expert pastry cook; sometimes the kitchen looked
as if a bomb had hit it. even the cookies they bought at the baker's were never exactly
the same. every single cookie was shaped separately in the baker's hands.
then a satisfied smile spread over sophie's face. she remembered how once she and
her father went shopping while her mother was busy baking christmas cookies. when
they got back there wer

e a lot of gingerbread men spread out on the kitchen table.
even though they weren't all perfect, in a way they were all the same. and why was
that? obviously because her mother had used the same mold for all of them.
sophie felt so pleased with herself for having remembered the incident that she
pronounced herself done with the first question. if a baker makes fifty absolutely
identical cookies, he must be using the same pastry mold for all of them. and that's 
that!
then the video-plato had looked into the camera and asked why all horses were the
same. but they weren't, at all! on the contrary, sophie thought no two horses were the
same, just as no two people were th

ith the same mold?
then plato had asked her a really difficult question. does man have an immortal soul?
that was something sophie felt quite unqualified to answer. all she knew was that
dead bodies were either cremated or buried, so there was no future for them. if man
had an immortal soul, one would have to believe that a person consisted of two
separate parts: a body that gets worn out after many years--and a soul that operates
more or less independently of what happens to the body. her grandmother had said
once that she felt it was only her body that was old. inside she had always been the
same young girl-the thought of the "young girl" led sophie to the last question: are
women and men equally sensible? she was not so sure about that. it depended on
what plato meant by sensible.
something the philosopher had said about socrates came into her mind. socrates had
pointed out that everyone could understand philosophical truths if they just used their
common sense. he had also said that a sl

 world of ideas, before her soul had taken residence in a human body.
could it be true that she had lived before? had her soul existed before it got a body to
move around in? and was it really true that she carried a little golden nugget inside
her--a jewel that cannot be corroded by time, a soul that would live on when her own
body grew old and died?
the major's cabin
... the girl in the mirror winked with both eyes...
it was only a quarter past seven. there was no need to hurry home. sophie's mother
always took it easy on sundays, so she would probably sleep for another two hours.
should she go a bit farther into the woods and try to find alberto knox? and why had
the dog snarled at her so viciously?
sophie got up and began to walk down the path hermes had taken. she had the brown
envelope with the pages on plato in her hand. wherever the path diverged she took
the wider one.
birds were chirping everywhere--in the trees and in the air, in bush and thicket. they
were busily occupied with th

hese questions right now, but she assumed they
had something to do with the next philosopher. wasn't he called aristotle?
when she finally saw the hedge after running so far through the woods it was like
swimming ashore after a shipwreck. the hedge looked funny from the other side.
she didn't look at her watch until she had crawled into the den. it was ten-thirty. she
put the big envelope into the biscuit tin with the other papers and stuffed the note with
the new questions down her tights.
her mother was on the telephone when she came in. when she saw sophie she hung
up quickly.
"where on earth have you been?"
"i... went for a walk ... in the woods," she stammered.
"so i see."
sophie stood silently, watching the water dripping from her dress.
"i called joanna..."
"joanna?"
her mother brought her some dry clothes. sophie only just managed to hide the
philosopher's note. then they sat together in the kitchen, and her mother made some
hot chocolate.
"were you with him?" she asked after a while

she shook her head again. then more questions came raining down on her.
"now i want the truth. were you out all night? why did you go to bed with your
clothes on? did you sneak out as soon as i had gone to bed? you're only fourteen,
sophie. i demand to know who you are seeing!"
sophie started to cry. then she talked. she was still frightened, and when you are
frightened you usually talk.
she explained that she had woken up very early and had gone for a walk in the woods.
she told her mother about the cabin and the boat, and about the mysterious mirror.
but she mentioned nothing about the secret correspondence course. neither did she
mention the green wallet. she didn't quite know why, but she had to keep hilde for
herself.
her mother put her arms around sophie, and sophie knew that her mother believed
her now.
"i don't have a boyfriend," sophie sniffed. "it was just something i said because you
were so upset about the white rabbit."
"and you really went all the way to the major's

cabin ..." said her mother thoughtfully.
"the major's cabin?" sophie stared at her mother.
"the little woodland cabin is called the major's cabin because some years ago an army 
major lived there for a time. he was rather eccentric, a little crazy, i think. but never
mind that. since then the cabin has been unoccupied."
"but it isn't! there's a philosopher living there now."
"oh stop, don't start fantasizing again!"
sophie stayed in her room, thinking about what had happened. her head felt like a
roaring circus full of lumbering elephants, silly clowns, daring trapeze flyers, and

 i wanted
so much to meet you and discuss some of the philosophic problems. for the moment i
am a plato fan, but i am not so sure he was right about ideas or pattern pictures
existing in another reality. of course they exist in our souls, but i think--for the
moment anyway-- that this is a different thing. i have to admit too that i am not
altogether convinced of the immortality of the soul. personally, i have no recollections
from my former lives. if you could convince me that my deceased grandmother's soul
is happy in the world of ideas, i would be most grateful.
actually, it was not for philosophic reasons that i started to write this letter (which i

being disobedient. i tried to pull the boat completely up on shore but i was obviously
not strong enough. or perhaps a big wave dragged the boat out again.

was probably also quite
important to have a job you liked. if you hated traffic, for instance, you would not be
very happy as a taxi driver. and if you hated doing homework it would probably be a
bad idea to become a teacher. sophie loved animals and wanted to be a vet. but in any
case she didn't think it was necessary to win a million in the lottery to live a good life.
quite the opposite, more likely. there was a saying:
the devil finds work for idle hands.
sophie stayed in her room until her mother called her down to a big midday meal. she
had prepared sirloin steak and baked potatoes. there were cloudberries and cream for
dessert. 
they talked about all kinds of things. sophie's mother asked her how she wanted to
celebrate her fifteenth birthday. it was only a few weeks away.
sophie shrugged.
"aren't you going to invite anyone? i mean, don't you want to have a party?"
"maybe."
"we could ask martha and anne marie ... and helen. and joanna, of course. and
jeremy, perhaps. but that's for yo

so clearly, you know. it doesn't seem all that long ago. i felt i was already quite grown
up. isn't it odd, sophie! i don't feel i have changed at all since then."
"you haven't. nothing changes. you have just developed, gotten older..."
"mm ... that was a very grownup thing to say. i just think it's all happened so very
quickly."
aristotle...a meticulous organizer who wanted to clarify our concepts ...
while her mother was taking her afternoon nap, sophie went down to the den. she
had put a lump of sugar in the pink envelope and written "to alberto" on the outside.
there was no new letter, but after a few minutes sophie heard the dog approaching.
"hermes!" she called, and the next moment he had pushed his way into the den with a
big brown envelope in his mouth.
"good boy!" sophie put her arm around the dog, which was snorting and snuffling
like a walrus. she took the pink envelope with the lump of sugar and p

 it comes to discovering
answers to the riddles of philosophy, i'd say your adventure was very promising. it's
just a little annoying that i'll have to move now. still, i have no one to blame but
myself, i suppose. i might have known you were a person who would always want to
get to the bottom of things.
greetings, alberto
sophie was relieved. so he was not angry after all. but why would he have to move?
she took the papers and ran up to her room. it would be prudent to be in the house
when her mother woke up. lying comfortably on her bed, she began to read about
aristotle.
philosopher and scientist
dear sophie: you were probably astonished by plato's theory or ideas. you are not the
only one! i do not know whether you swallowed the whole thing--hook, line, and
sinker--or whether you had any critical comments. but if you did have, you can be
sure that the self-same criticism was raised by aristotle (384-322 b.c.), who was a
pupil at plato's academy for almost twenty years.
aristotle was not

t everest.) certainly we knew
that, sophie. but the relationship between classes of things is not always so obvious.
from time to time it can be necessary to clarify our concepts.
for example: is it really possible that tiny little baby mice suckle just like lambs and
piglets? mice certainly do not lay eggs. (when did i last see a mouse's egg?) so they
give birth to live young--just like pigs and sheep. but we call animals that bear live
young mammals--and mammals are animals that feed on their mother's milk. so--we
got there. we had the answer inside us but we had to think it through. we forgot for
the moment that mice really do suckle from their mother. perhaps it was because we
have never seen a baby mouse being suckled, for the simple reason that mice are
rather shy of humans when they suckle their young.
nature's scale
when aristotle "clears up" in life, he first of all points out that everything in the
natural world can be divided into two main categories. on the one hand there are

o the ring binder. this also went onto the top shelf. later on in the
day she would have to bring in the cookie tin from the den.
from now on things would be kept neat. and she didn't only mean in her room. after
reading aristotle, she realized it was just as important to keep her ideas orderly. she
had reserved the top shelf of the closet especially for that kind of thing. it was the
only place in the room that she did not yet have complete control over.
there had been no sign of life from her mother for over two hours. sophie went
downstairs. before she woke her mother up she decided to feed her pets.
she bent over the goldfish bowl in the kitchen. one of the fishes was black, one
orange, and one red and white. this was why she called them black jack, gold-top,
and red ridinghood.
as she sprinkled fish food into the water she said:
"you belong to nature's living creatures, you can absorb nourishment, you can grow
and reproduce yourselves. more specifically, you belong to the animal kingdom

especially pleased with the
expression "the waters of life." so now it was the budgerigars' turn.
sophie poured a little birdseed in their feeding cup and said: 
"dear smit and smule. you have become dear little budgerigars because you grew out
of dear little budgerigar eggs, and because these eggs had the form of being
budgerigars, luckily you didn't grow into squawking parrots."
sophie then went into the large bathroom, where the sluggish tortoise lay in a big box.
every now and then when her mother showered, she yelled that she would kill it one
day. but so far it had been an empty threat. sophie took a lettuce leaf from a large jam
jar and laid it in the box.
"dear govinda," she said. "you are not one of the speediest animals, but you certainly
are able to sense a tiny fraction of the great big world we live in. you'll have to
content yourself with the fact that you are not the only one who can't exceed your own
limits."
sherekan was probably out catching mice--that was a cat's nature, a

fter all. sophie
crossed the living room toward her mother's bedroom. a vase of daffodils stood on the
coffee table. it was as if the yellow blooms bowed respectfully as sophie went by. she
stopped for a moment and let her fingers gently brush their smooth heads. "you
belong to the living part of nature too," she said. "actually, you are quite privileged
compared to the vase you are in. but unfortunately you are not able to appreciate it."
then sophie tiptoed into her mother's bedroom. although her mother was in a deep
sleep, sophie laid a hand on her forehead.
"you are one of the luckiest ones," she said, "because you are not only alive like the
lilies of the field. and you are not only a living creature like sherekan or govinda.
you are a human, and therefore have the rare capacity of thought."
"what on earth are you talking about, sophie?"
her mother had woken up more quickly than usual.
"i was just saying that you look like a lazy tortoise. i can otherwise info

her mother lifted her head. 
"i'll be right there," she said. "will you put the coffee on?"
sophie did as she was asked, and they were soon sitting in the kitchen over coffee,
juice, and chocolate.
suddenly sophie said, "have you ever wondered why we are alive, mom?"
"oh, not again!"
"yes, because now i know the answer. people live on this planet so that someone can
go around giving names to everything."
"is that right? i never thought of that."
"then you have a big problem, because a human is a thinking

animal. if you don't
think, you're not really a human."
"sophie!"
"imagine if there were only vegetables and animals. then there wouldn't have been
anybody to tell the difference between 'cat' and 'dog,' or 'lily' and 'gooseberry.'
vegetables and animals are living too, but we are the only creatures that can
categorize nature into different groups and classes."
"you really are the most peculiar girl i have ever had," said her mother.
"i should hope so," said sophie. "everybody is more or less peculiar. i am a person, so
i am more or less peculiar. you have only one girl, so i am the most peculiar."
"what i meant was that you scare the living daylights out of me with all that new
talk."
"you are easily scared, then."
later that afternoon sophie went back to the den. she managed to smuggle the big
cookie tin up to her room without her mother noticing.
first she put all the pages in the right order. then she punched holes in

 the 18th as
well. as they walked home after school joanna suddenly exclaimed, "let's go
camping!"
sophie's immediate reaction was that she couldn't be away from the house for long. 
but then she said, "sure, why not?"
a couple of hours later joanna arrived at sophie's door with a large backpack. sophie
had packed hers as well, and she also had the tent. they both had bedrolls and
sweaters, groundsheets and flashlights, large-size thermos bottles and plenty of their
favorite food.
when sophie's mother got home around five o'clock, she gave them a sermon about
what they must and must not do. she also insisted on knowing where they were going
to set up camp.
they told her they intended to make for grouse top. they might be lucky enough to
hear the mating call of the grouse next morning.
sophie had an ulterior motive for choosing that particular spot. she thought that
grouse top must be pretty close to the major's cabin. something was urging her to
return to it, but she didn't dare go alone.
th

nd set off for home. sophie carried the large
mirror under her arm. from time to time she had to rest--joanna refused to touch it.
as they approached the outskirts of the town they heard a few sporadic shots. sophie
recalled what hilde's father had written about war-torn lebanon, and she realized how
lucky she was to have been born in a peaceful country. the "shots" they heard came
from innocent fireworks celebrating the national holiday.
sophie invited joanna in for a cup of hot chocolate. her mother was very curious to
know where they had found the mirror. sophie told her they had found it outside the
major's cabin, and her mother repeated the story about nobody having lived there for
many years.
when joanna had gone, sophie put on a red dress. the rest of the norwegian national
day passed quite normally. in the evening, the tv news had a feature on how the
norwegian un battalion had celebrated the day in lebanon. sophie's eyes were glued
to the screen. one of the men she was seeing could

of her life, but as nothing
further seemed to hap-pen, the immediate terror faded and was submerged in
homework and badminton.
sophie read alberto's letters over and over, looking for some clue that would throw
light on the hilde mystery. doing so also gave her plenty of opportunity to digest the
classical philosophy. she no longer had difficulty in distinguishing democritus and
socrates, or plato and aristotle, from each other.
on friday, may 25, she was in the kitchen fixing dinner before her mother got home.
it was their regular friday agreement. today she was making fish soup with fish balls
and carrots. plain and simple.
outside it was becoming windy. as sophie stood stirring the casserole she turned
toward the window. the birch trees were waving like cornstalks.
suddenly something smacked against the window-pane. sophie turned around again
and discovered a card sticking to the window.
it was a postcard. she could read it through the glass: "hilde moller knag, c/o sophie
amundsen."

n open your eyes. meet me at st. mary's church at eight
o'clock tomorrow morning. but come alone, my child."
"so early in the morning?"
the telephone clicked.
"hello?"
he had hung up! sophie rushed back to the stove just before the fish soup boiled over.
st. mary's church? that was an old stone church from the middle ages. it was only
used for concerts and very special ceremonies. and in the summer it was sometimes
open to tourists. but surely it wasn't open in the middle of the night?
when her mother got home, sophie had put the card from lebanon with everything
else from alberto and hilde. after dinner she went over to joanna's place.
"we have to make a very special arrangement," she said as soon as her friend opened
the door.
she said no more until joanna had closed her bedroom door.
"it's rather problematic," sophie went on.
"spit it out!"
"i'm going to have to tell mom that i'm staying the night here."
"great!"
"but it's only something i'm saying, you see. i've got to go somewhere else.

" 
"that's bad. is it a guy?"
"no, it's to do with hilde."
joanna whistled softly, and sophie looked her severely in the eye.
"i'm coming over this evening," she said, "but at seven o'clock i've got to sneak out
again. you've got to cover for me until i get back."
"but where are you going? what is it you have to do?"
"sorry. my lips are sealed."
sleepovers were never a problem. on the contrary, almost. sometimes sophie got the
impression that her mother enjoyed having the house to herself.
"you'll be home for breakfast, i suppose?" was her mother's only remark as sophie
left the house.
"if i'm not, you know where i am."
what on earth made her say that? it was the one weak spot.
sophie's visit began like any other sleepover, with talk until late into the night. the
only difference was that when they finally settled down to sleep at about two o'clock,
sophie set the alarm clock to a quarter to seven.
five hours later, joanna woke briefly as soph

bingen..."
sophie's eyes widened:
"does she have anything to do with hilde?"
"what a question! hildegard lived as a nun in the rhine valley from 1098 to 1179. in
spite of being a woman, she worked as preacher, author, physician, botanist, and
naturalist. she is an example of the fact that women were often more practical, more
scientific even, in the middle ages."
"but what about hilde?"
"it was an ancient christian and jewish belief that god was not only a man. he also
had a female side, or 'mother nature.' women, too, are created in god's likeness. in
greek, this female side of god is called sophia. 'sophia' or 'sophie' means wisdom."
sophie shook her head resignedly. why had nobody ever told her that? and why had
she never asked?
alberto continued: "sophia, or god's mother nature, had a certain significance both
for jews and in the greek orthodox church throughout the middle ages. in the west
she was forgotten. but along comes hildegard. sophia appeared to her in a vision,

this was not the first time sophie had dreamed she found a treasure. but this was
definitely the first time she had brought it back from the dream.
"damn!" she said aloud.
she was so mad that she opened the closet door and hurled the delicate crucifix up
onto the top shelf with the silk scarf, the white stocking, and the postcards from
lebanon.
the next morning sophie woke up to a big breakfast of hot rolls, orange juice, eggs,
and vegetable salad. it was not often that her mother was up before sophie on a
sunday morning. when she was, she liked to fix a solid meal for sophie.
while they were eating, mom said, "there's a strange dog in the garden. it's been
sniffing round the old hedge all morning. i can't imagine what it's doing here, can
you?"
 "yes!" sophie burst out, and at once regretted it.
"has it been here before?"
sophie had already left the table and gone into the living room to look out of the
window facing the large garden. it was just as she thought.
hermes

was lying in front of the secret entrance to her den.
what should she say? she had no time to think of anything before her mother came
and stood beside her.
"did you say it had been here before?" she asked.
"i expect it buried a bone there and now it's come to fetch its treasure. dogs have
memories too ..." 
"maybe you're right, sophie. you're the animal psychologist in the family."
sophie thought feverishly.
"i'll take it home," she said.
"you know where it lives, then?"
sophie shrugged her shoulders.
"it's probably got an address on its collar."
a couple of minutes later sophie was on her way down the garden. when herme

caught sight of her he came lolloping toward her, wagging his tail and jumping up to
her.
"good boy, hermes!" said sophie.
she knew her mother was watching from the window. she prayed he would not go
through the hedge. but the dog dashed toward the gravel path in front of the house,
streaked across the front yard, and jumped up to the gate.
when they had shut the gate behind them, hermes continued to run a few yards in
front of sophie. it was a long way. sophie and hermes were not the only ones out for
a sunday walk. whole families were setting off for the day. sophie felt a pang of
envy.
from time to time hermes would run off and sni

with that she opened the door to the staircase. as the door closed, alberto said, "it
won't be long before we meet again, hilde."
sophie was left with those words.
another slip of the tongue, the villain! sophie had a strong desire to turn around and
hammer on the door but something held her back.
on reaching the street she remembered that she had no money on her. she would have
to walk all the long way home. how annoying! her mother would be both angry and 
worried if she didn't get back by six, that was for sure.
she had not gone more than a few yards when she suddenly noticed a coin on the
sidewalk. it was ten crowns, exactly the price of a bus ticket.
sophie found her way to the bus stop and waited for a bus to the main square. from
there she could take a bus on the same ticket and ride almost to her door.
not until she was standing at the main square waiting for the second bus did she
begin to wonder why she had been l

needed it.
could hilde's father have left it there? he was a master at leaving things in the most
convenient places.
how could he, if he was in lebanon?
and why had alberto made that slip? not once but twice!
sophie shivered. she felt a chill run down her spine.
the baroque
...such stuff as dreams are made on...
sophie heard nothing more from alberto for several days, but she glanced frequently
into the garden hoping to catch sight of hermes. she told her mother that the dog had
found its own way home and that she had been invited in by its owner, a former
physics teacher. he had told sophie about the solar system and the new science that
developed in the sixteenth century.
she told joanna more. she told her all about her visit to alberto, the postcard in the
mailbox, and the ten-crown piece she had found on the way home. she kept the dream
about hilde and the gold crucifix to herself.
on tuesday, may 29, sophie was standing in the kitchen doing the di

shes. her mother
had gone into the living room to watch the tv news. when the opening theme faded
out she heard from the kitchen that a major in the norwegian un battalion had been 
killed by a shell.
sophie threw the dish towel on the table and rushed into the living room. she was just
in time to catch a glimpse of the un officer's face for a few seconds before they
switched to the next item.
"oh no!" she cried.
her mother turned to her.
"yes, war is a terrible thing!"
sophie burst into tears.
"but sophie, it's not that bad!"
 "did they say his name?"
"yes, but i don't remember it. he was from grimstad, i think."
"isn't that the same as lillesand?"
"no, you're being silly."
"but if you come from grimstad, you might go to school in lillesand."
she had stopped crying, but now it was her mother's turn to react. she got out of her
chair and switched off the tv.
"what's going on, sophie?"
"nothing."
"yes, there is. yo

questions of my own."
"i think we need to talk."
"that may be. but right now i'm so worn out i'm going to bed. and i'm getting my
period."
sophie ran up to her room; she felt like crying.
as soon as she was through in the bathroom and had curled up under the covers, her
mother came into the bedroom.
sophie pretended to be asleep even though she knew her mother wouldn't believe it.
she knew her mother knew that sophie knew her mother wouldn't believe it either.
nevertheless her mother pretended to believe that sophie was asleep. she sat on the
edge of sophie's bed and stroked her hair.
sophie was thinking how complicated it was to live two lives at the same time. she
began to look forward to the end of the philosophy course. maybe it would be over by
her birthday--or

he said suddenly.
"that sounds great. who will you invite?" 
"lots of people ... can i?"
"of course. we have a big garden. hopefully the good weather will continue."
"most of all i'd like to have it on midsummer eve."
"all right, that's what we'll do."
"it's a very important day," sophie said, thinking not only of her birthday.
"it is, indeed."
"i feel i've grown up a lot lately."
"that's good, isn't it?"
"i don't know."
sophie had been talking with her head almost buried in her pillow. now her mother
said, "sophie--you must tell me why you seem so out of balance at the moment."
"weren't you like this when you were fifteen?"
"probably. but you know what i am talking about."
sophie suddenly turned to face her mother. "the dog's name is hermes," she said.
"it is?"
"it belongs to a man called alberto."
"i see."
"he lives down in the old town."
"you went all that way with the dog?" 
"there's nothing dangerous about that."
"you said that the dog had often been here."
"did i say that?"

"then you just tell them he isn't."
"well, we'll have to see."
"yes, we shall. and sophie--it is true that things haven't always been easy between
dad and me. but there was never anyone else ..."
"i have to sleep now. i've got such awful cramps."
"do you want an aspirin?" /'yes, please."
when her mother returned with the pill and a glass of water sophie had fallen asleep.
may 31 was a thursday. sophie agonized through the afternoon classes at school. she
was doing better in some subjects since she started on the philosophy course. usually
her grades were good in most subjects, but lately they were even better, except in
math.
in the last class they got an essay handed back. sophie had written on "man and

that was actually quite a lot in the space of one second.
he dashed up to her, wagged his tail wildly, and jumped up to lick her face.
"hermes, clever boy! down, down. no, stop slobbering all over me. heel, boy! that's
it!"
sophie let herself into the house. sherekan came jumping out from the bushes. he
was rather wary of the stranger. sophie put his cat food out, poured birdseed in the
budgerigars' cup, got out a salad leaf for the tortoise, and wrote a note to her mother.
she wrote that she was going to take hermes home and would be back by seven.
they set off through the town. sophie had remembered to take some money with her
this time. she wondered whether she ought to take the bus with hermes, but decided
she had better wait and ask alberto about it.
while she walked on and on behind hermes she thought about what an animal really
is.
what was the difference between a dog and a person? she recalled aristotle's words.
he said that people and animals are both n

"okay, let's go back in time to the stone age boy who lived thirty thousand years ago.
when he grew up, he cast spears after wild animals, loved a woman who became the
mother of his children, and quite certainly worshipped the tribal gods. do you really
think he decided all that for himself?"
"i don't know."
"or think of a lion in africa. do you think it makes up its mind to be a beast of prey?
is that why it attacks a limping antelope? could it instead have made up its mind to be
a vegetarian?"
"no, a lion obeys its nature."
"you mean, the laws of nature. so do you, sophie, because you are also part of nature.
you could of course protest, with the support of descar

not a free human being with free mental faculties. but think of a newborn baby that
screams and yells. if it doesn't get milk it sucks its thumb. does that baby have a free

"i guess not."
"when does the child get its free will, then? at the age of two, she runs around and
points at everything in sight. at the age of three she nags her mother, and at the age of
four she suddenly gets afraid of the dark. where's the freedom, sophie?" 
"i don't know."
"when she is fifteen, she sits in front of a mirror experimenting with makeup. is this
the moment when she makes her own personal decisions and does what she likes?"
"i see what you're getting at."
"she is sophie amundsen, certainly. but she also lives according to the laws of nature.
the point is that she doesn't realize it because there are so many complex reasons for
everything she do

 not jump to conclusions. there could be a simpler explanation."
"well whatever, i have to hurry home. my mom is waiting for me."
alberto saw her to the door. as she left, he said:
"we'll meet again, dear hilde."
then the door closed behind her.

sophie arrived home at eight-thirty. that was one and a half hours after the
agreement--which was not really an agreement. she had simply skipped dinner and
left a message for her mother that she would be back not later than seven.
"this has got to stop, sophie. i had to call information and ask if they had any record
of anyone named alberto in the old town. they laughed at me."
"i couldn't get away. i think we're just about to make a breakthrough in a huge
mystery."
"nonsense!"
"it's true!"
"did you invite him to your party?"
"oh no, i forgot."
"well, now i insist on meeting him. tomorrow at the latest. it's not natural for a young
girl to be meeting an older man like this."
"

you've got no reason to be scared of alberto. it may be worse with hilde's father."
"who's hilde?"
"the daughter of the man in lebanon. he's really bad. he may be controlling the
whole world."
"if you don't immediately introduce me to your alberto, i won't allow you to see him
again. i won't feel easy about him until i at least know what he looks like."
sophie had a brilliant idea and dashed up to her room.
"what's the matter with you now?" her mother called after her.
in a flash sophie was back again. 
"in a minute you'll see what he looks like. and then i hope you'll let me be."
she waved the video cassette and went over to the vcr.
"did he give you a video?"
"from athens..."
pictures of the acropolis soon appeared on the screen. her mother sat dumbfounded
as alberto came forward and began to speak directly to sophie.
sophie now noticed something she had forgotten about. the acropolis was crowded
with tourists milling about in their respec

tive groups. a small placard was being held
up from the middle of one group. on it was written hilde ... alberto continued his
wandering on the acropolis. after a while he went down through the entrance and
climbed to the areopagos hill where paul had addressed the athenians. then he went
on to talk to sophie from the square.
her mother sat commenting on the video in short utterances:
"incredible... is that alberto? he mentioned the rabbit again... but, yes, he's really
talking to you, sophie. i didn't know paul went to athens ..."
the video was coming to the part where ancient athens suddenly rises from the ruins.
at the last minute sophie managed to stop the tape. now that she had shown her
mother alberto, there was no need to introduce her to plato as well.
there was silence in the room.
"what do you think of him? he's quit

e good-looking, isn't he?" teased sophie.
"what a strange man he must be, having himself filmed in athens just so he could
send it to a girl he hardly knows. when was he in athens?"
"i haven't a clue."
"but there's something else ..." 
"what?"
 "he looks very much like the major who lived in that little hut in the woods."
"well maybe it is him, mom."
"but nobody has seen him for over fifteen years."
"he probably moved around a lot... to athens, maybe."
her mother shook her head. "when i saw him sometime in the seventies, he wasn't a
day younger than this alberto i just saw. he had a foreign-sounding name..."
"knox?"
"could be, sophie. could be his name was knox."
"or was it knag?"
"i can't for the life of me remember ... which knox or knag are you talking about?"
"one is alberto, the other is hilde's father."
"it's all making me dizzy."
"is there any food in the house?"
"you can warm up the meatballs."

sophie tore the note off the door and stuffed it into alberto's mailbox as she went out.
damn! surely he'd not gone back to athens? how could he leave her with so many
questions unanswered?
when she got home from school on june 14, hermes was romping about in the garden.
sophie ran toward him and he came prancing happily toward her. she put her arms
around him as if he were the one who could solve all the riddles.
again she left a note for her mother, but this time she put alberto's address on it.
as they made their way across town sophie thought about tomorrow. not about her
own birthday so much-- that was not going to be celebrated until midsummer eve
anyway. but tomorrow was hilde's birthday too. sophie was convinced something
quite extraordinary would happen. at least there would be an end to all those birthday
cards from lebanon.
when they had crossed main square and were making for the old town, they passed
by a park with a playground

sophie ran across main square and on through the town. as she ran, one thought kept
going round and round in her mind: "tomorrow is my birthday* isn't it extra bitter to
realize that life is only a dream on the day before your fifteenth birthday? it's like
dreaming you won a million and then just as you're getting the money you wake up." 
sophie ran across the squelching playing field. minutes later she saw someone come
running toward her. it was her mother. the sky was pierced again and again by angry
darts of lightning.
when they reached each other sophie's mother put her arm around her.
"what's happening to us, little one?"
"i don't know," sophie sobbed. "it's like a bad dream."

mer, but the old rowboat was tied up to the dock. she must remember to bail the
water out of it after last night's heavy downpour.
as she was looking out over the little bay, she remembered the time when as a little
girl of six she had climbed up into the rowboat and rowed out into the bay alone. she 
had fallen overboard and it was all she could do to struggle ashore. drenched to the
skin, she had pushed her way through the thicket hedge. as she stood in the garden
looking up at the house, her mother had come running toward her. the boat and both
oars were left afloat in the bay. she still dreamed about the boat sometimes, drifting
on its own, abandoned. it had been an embarrassing experience.
the garden was neither especially luxuriant nor particularly well kept. but it was
large and it was hilde's. a weather-beaten apple tree and a few practically barren fruit
bushes had just about survived the severe winter storms. the old glider stood on the
lawn between granite rocks and thicket. it lo

several weeks and the tips of the leaves on the birch trees had started to turn yellow.
now it was as if the whole world had been newly washed. it seemed as if even her
childhood had been washed away with the storm.
"indeed, there is pain when spring buds burst..." wasn't there a swedish poet who had
said something like that? or was she finnish?
hilde stood in front of the heavy brass mirror hanging on the wall above
grandmother's old dresser.
was she pretty? she wasn't ugly, anyway. maybe she was kind of in-between ... 
she had long, fair hair. hilde had always wished her hair could be either a bit fairer or
a bit darker. this in-between color was so mousy. on the positive side, there were
these soft curls. lots of her friends struggled to get their hair to curl just a little bit,
but hilde's hair had always been naturally curly. another positive feature, she thought,
were her deep green eyes. "are they really green?"

the mirror. many years ago her father had joked about not being able to wink at your
own reflection with both eyes at the same time, except in this brass mirror. it was an
exception because it was an old magic mirror great-grandmother had bought from a
gypsy woman just after her wedding.
hilde had tried for ages, but it was just as hard to wink at yourself with both eyes as to
run away from your own shadow. in the end she had been given the old family
heirloom to keep. through the years she had tried from time to time to master the
impossible art.
not surprisingly, she was pensive today. and not unnaturally, she was preoccupied
with herself. fifteen years old ...
she happened to glance at her bedside table. there was a large

 wrapping and was tied with a red silk ribbon. it must be a birthday
present!
could this be the present? the great big present from dad that had been so very secret? 
he had dropped so many cryptic hints in his cards from lebanon. but he had
"imposed a severe censorship on himself."
the present was something that "grew bigger and bigger," he had written. then he
had said something about a girl she was soon to meet--and that he had sent copies of
all his cards to her. hilde had tried to pump her mother for clues, but she had no idea
what he meant, either.
the oddest hint had been that the present could perhaps be "shared with other
people." he wasn't working for the un for nothing! if her father had one bee in his
bonnet--and he had plenty--it was that the. un ought to be a kind of world
government. may the un one day really be able to unite the whole of humanity, he
had written on one of his cards.

she read about the greek natural philosophers. hilde knew that her father was
interested in philosophy. he had written an article in the newspaper proposing that
philosophy should be a regular school subject. it was called "why should philosophy
be part of the school curriculum?" he had even raised the issue at a pta meeting in
hilde's class. hilde had found it acutely em-barrassing.
she looked at the clock. it was seven-thirty. it would probably be half an hour before 
her mother came up with the breakfast tray, thank goodness, because right now she
was engrossed in sophie and all the philosophical questions. she read the chapter
called "democritus." first of all, sophie got a question to think about: why is lego
the most ingenious toy in the world? then she found a large brown envelope in the
mailbox:
democritus agreed with his predecessors that transformations in nature could not be
due to the fact that anything actually "changed." he therefore assumed that everything

 not interested enough in the un forces' peacekeeping task. if
nobody else was, then sophie would have to be. in that way he could write it into his
story and get some sort of attention from the media.
she had to smile as she read the p.p.s. in the philosophy teacher's letter to sophie:
if you should come across a red silk scarf anywhere, please take care of it. sometimes
personal property gets mixed up. especially at school and places like that, and this is a
philosophy school.
hilde heard her mother's footsteps on the stairs. before she knocked on the door,
hilde had begun to read about sophie's discovery of the video of athens in her secret
den.
"happy birthday ..." her mother had begun to sing halfway up the stairs.
"come in," said hilde, in the middle of the passage where the philosophy teacher was
talking directly to sophie from the acropolis. he looked almost exactly like hilde's
father--with a "black, well-trimmed beard" and a blue beret.
"happy birthday, hilde!" 
"uh-huh."
"hilde?"

"just put it there."
"aren't you going to ... ?"
"you can see i'm reading."
"imagine, you're fifteen!"
"have you ever been to athens, mom?"
"no, why do you ask?"
"it's so amazing that those old temples are still standing. they are actually 2,500 years
old. the biggest one is called the virgin's place, by the way."
"have you opened your present from dad?"
"what present?"
 "you must look up now, hilde. you're in a complete daze."
hilde let the large ring binder slide down onto her lap.
her mother stood leaning over the bed with the tray. on it were lighted candles,
buttered rolls with shrimp salad, and a soda. there was also a small package. her
mother stood awkwardly holding the tray with both hands, with a flag under one arm.
"oh, thanks a lot, mom. it's sweet of you, but i'm really busy."
"you don't have to go to school till one o'clock."
not until now did hilde remember where she was, and her mother put the tray down
on the bedside table. 
"sorry, mom. i was completely absorbed in t

his."
"what is it he has written, hilde? i've been just as mystified as you. it's been
impossible to get a sensible word out of him for months."
for some reason hilde felt embarrassed. "oh, it's just a story."
"a story?"
"yes, a story. and a history of philosophy. or something like that."
"aren't you going to open the package from me?"
hilde didn't want to be unfair, so she opened her mother's present right away. it was a
gold bracelet.
"it's lovely, mom! thank you very much!"
hilde got out of bed and gave her mother a hug.
they sat talking for a while.
then hilde said, "i have to get back to the book, mom. right now he's standing on
top of the acropolis."
"who is?"
"i've no idea. neither has sophie. that's the whole point."
"well, i have to get to work. don't forget to eat something. your dress is on a hanger
downstairs."
finally her mother disappeared down the stairs. so did soph

women, the en-cyclopedia was about as informative as a moon crater. was the whole
work censored by the society for the protection of men?
hildegard of bingen was a preacher, a writer, a doctor, a botanist, and a biologist. she
was "perhaps an example of the fact that women were often more practical, more
scientific even, in the middle ages."
but there was not a single word about her in the encyclopedia. how scandalous!
hilde had never heard that god had a "female side" or a "mother nature." her name
was sophia, apparently--but she was apparently not worth printer's ink, either.
the nearest she could find in the encyclopedia was an entry about the santa sophia
church in constantinople (now istanbul), named hagia sophia, which means sacred
wisdom. but there was nothing about it being female. that was censorship, wasn't it? 
otherwise, it was true enough that sophie had revealed herself to hilde. she was
picturing the girl with the straight hair all the time ...

ature's own. but beyond that face was the apparition of
another girl.
suddenly the other girl began to wink frantically with both eyes, as if to signal that
she was really in there on the other side. the apparition lasted only a few seconds.
then she was gone.
how many times had hilde stood in front of the mirror like that as if she was
searching for someone else behind the glass? but how could her father have known
that?
wasn't it also a dark-haired woman she had been searching for? great-grandmother
had bought it from a gypsy woman, hadn't she? hilde felt her hands shaking as they
held the book. she had the feeling that sophie really existed somewhere "on the other
side."
now sophie is dreaming about hilde and bjerkely. hilde can neither see nor hear her,
but then--sophie finds hilde's gold crucifix on the dock. and the crucifix--with
hilde's initials and everything--is in sophie's bed when she wakes after her dream!
hilde forced herself to think hard. surely she hadn't lost her crucifix a

received as a christening gift from her grandmother, was not there!
so she really had lost it. all right, but how had her father known it when she didn't
even know it herself?
and another thing: sophie had apparently dreamed that hilde's father came home
from lebanon. but there was still a week to go before that happened. was sophie's
dream prophetic? did her father mean that when he came home sophie would 
somehow be there? he had written that she would get a new friend ...

hilde had just begun the chapter on the renaissance when she heard her mother come
in the front door. she looked at the clock. it was four in the afternoon.
her mother ran upstairs and opened hilde's door.
"didn't you go to the church?"
"yes, i did."
"but... what did you wear?"
"what i'm wearing now."
"your nightgown?"
"it's an old stone church from the middle ages."
"hilde!"
she let the ring binder fall into her lap and looked up at her mother.
"i forgot the time, mom. i'm sorry, but i'm reading something terribly exciting."
her mother could not help smiling.
"it's a magic book," added hilde.
"okay. happy birthday once again, hilde!" 
"hey, i don't know if i

"but i haven't... i'm just going to rest for a while, then i'll start fixing a great dinner. i

"okay, i'll go on reading."
her mother left and hilde read on.
sophie is following hermes through the town. in alberto's hall she finds another card
from lebanon. this, too, is dated june 15.
hilde was just beginning to understand the system of the dates. the cards dated
before june 15 are copies of cards hilde had already received from her dad. but those
with today's date are reaching her for the first time via the ring binder.

 the same storm that raged over bjerkely last night--a few hours after sophie ran
through the town?
as she ran, one thought kept going round and round in her mind: "tomorrow is my
birthday*. isn't it extra bitter to realize that life is only a dream on the day before your
fifteenth birthday? it's like dreaming you won a million and then just as you're getting

"i don't know," sophie sobbed. "it's like a bad dream." 
hilde felt the tears start. "to be or not to be--that is the question." she threw the ring
binder to the end of the bed and stood up. she walked back and forth across the floor.
at last she stopped in front of the brass mirror, where she remained until her mother

e jigsaw puzzle of philosophy and science had fallen into place?
wasn't there a connection between the development of ideas and science on the one
hand, and the greenhouse effect and deforestation on the other? maybe it was not so
crazy to call man's thirst for knowledge a fall from grace?
the question was so huge and so terrifying that hilde tried to forget it again. she
would probably understand much more as she read further in her father's birthday
book.
"happy birthday to you ...," sang her mother when they were done with their ice
cream and italian strawberries. "now we'll do whatever you choose."
"i know it sounds a bit crazy, but all i want to do is read my present from dad."
"well, as long as he doesn't make you completely delirious." 
"no way."
"we could share a pizza while we watch that mystery on tv."
"yes, if you like."
hilde suddenly thought of the way sophie spoke to her mother. dad had hopefully not
written any of hilde's mother into the character of the other mother? just to

she decided not to mention the white rabbit being pulled out of the top hat. not today,
at least.
"by the way," she said as she was leaving the table.
"what?"
"i can't find my gold crucifix anywhere."
her mother looked at her with an enigmatic expression.
"i found it down by the dock weeks ago. you must have dropped it, you untidy
scamp."
"did you mention it to dad?"
"let me think ... yes, i believe i may have."
"where is it then?"
her mother got up and went to get her own jewelry case. hilde heard a little cry of
surprise from the bedroom. she came quickly back into the living room.
"right now i can't seem to find it."
"i thought as much."
she gave her mother a hug and ran upstairs to her room. at last--now she could read
on about sophie and alberto. she sat up on the bed as before with the heavy ring 
binder resting against her knees and began the next chapter.
sophie woke up the next morning when her mother came into the room car

rying a
tray loaded with birthday presents. she had stuck a flag in an empty soda bottle.
"happy birthday, sophie!"
sophie rubbed the sleep from her eyes. she tried to remember what had happened the
night before. but it was all like jumbled pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. one of the pieces
was alberto, another was hilde and the major. a third was berkeley, a fourth bjerkely.
the blackest piece of all was the violent storm. she had practically been in shock. her
mother had rubbed her dry with a towel and simply put her to bed with a cup of hot
milk and honey. she had fallen asleep immediately.
"i think i'm still alive," she said weakly.
"of course you're alive! and today you are fifteen years old."
"are you quite sure?"
"quite sure. shouldn't a mother know when her only child was born? june 15, 1975 ...
and half-past one, sophie. it was the happiest moment of my life."
"are you sure it isn't all only a dream?"
"it must be a good dream to wake up to rolls and

soda and birthday presents."
she put the tray of presents on a chair and disappeared out of the room for a second.
when she came back she was carrying another tray with rolls and soda. she put it on
the end of the bed.
it was the signal for the traditional birthday morning ritual, with the unpacking of
presents and her mother's sentimental flights back to her first contractions fifteen
years ago. her mother's present was a tennis racket. sophie had never played tennis,
but there were some open-air courts a few minutes from clover close. her father had
sent her a mini-tv and fm radio. the screen was no bigger than an ordinary
photograph. there were also presents from old aunts and friends of the family. 
presently her mother said, "do you think i should stay home from work today?"
"no, why should you?"
"you were very upset yesterday. if it goes on, i think we should make an appointment

"was it the storm--or was it alberto?"
"what about you? you said: what's happening to us, little one?"
"i was thinking of you running around town to meet some mysterious person ...
maybe it's my fault." "it's not anybody's 'fault' that i'm taking a course in philosophy
in my leisure time. just go to work. school doesn't start till ten, and we're only getting
our grades and sitting around."
"do you know what you're going to get?" "more than i got last semester at any rate."
not long after her mother had gone the telephone rang.
"sophie amundsen."
"this is alberto."
"ah."
"the major didn't spare any ammunition last night."
"what do you mean."
"the thunderstorm, sophie."
"i don't know what to think."
"that is the finest virtue a genuine philosopher can have. i am proud of how much
you have learned in such a short time." 
"i am scared that nothing is real."
"that's called existential angst, or dread, and is as a rule only a stage on the way to
new consciousness."

hilde's mother was calling from downstairs that the mystery was starting in ten
minutes and that she had put the pizza in the oven. hilde was quite exhausted after all
she had read. she had been up since six o'clock this morning.
she decided to spend the rest of the evening celebrating her birthday with her mother.
but first she had to look something up in her encyclopedia.

hilde ran downstairs to get a bigger encyclopedia.
 "i just have to look something up," she said to her astounded mother.
she took the forv to gp volume of the big family encyclopedia and ran up to her
room again. 
gouges ... there she was!
gouges, marie olympe (1748-1793), fr. author, played a prominent role during the
french revolution with numerous brochures on social questions and several plays.

it was close to midnight before major albert knag called home to wish hilde a happy
birthday. hilde's mother answered the telephone.
"it's for you, hilde."
"hello?"
"it's dad."
"are you crazy? it's nearly midnight!"
"i just wanted to say happy birthday ..."
"you've been doing that all day."
"... but i didn't want to call before the day was over."
"why?"
"didn't you get my present?"
"yes, i did. thank you very much."
"i can't wait to hear what you think of it." 
"it's terrific. i have hardly eaten all day, it's so exciting."
"i have to know how far you've gotten."
"they just went inside the major's cab

 up, but as alberto gave no sign of
rising, she asked: "shouldn't we see who it is?"
alberto shrugged and reluctantly got up. they opened the door, and a little girl stood
there in a white summer dress and a red bonnet. it was the girl they had seen on the
other side of the lake. over one arm she carried a basket of food.
"hi," said sophie. "who are you?"
"can't you see i am little red ridinghood?"
sophie looked at alberto, and alberto nodded.
"you heard what she said."
"i'm looking for my grandmother's house," said the girl. "she is old and sick, but i'm
taking her some food."
"it's not here," said alberto, "so you'd better get on your way." 
he gestured in a way that reminded sophie of the way you brush off a fly.
"but i'm supposed to deliver a letter," continued the girl in the red bonnet.
with that, she took out a small envelope and handed it to sophie. then she went
skipping away.
"watch out for the wolf!" sophie called after her.
alberto was already on his way back into the living room

.
"just think! that was little red ridinghood," said sophie.
"and it's no good warning her. she will go to her grandmother's house and be eaten
by the wolf. she never learns. it will repeat itself to the end of time "
"but i have never heard that she knocked on the door of another house before she
went to her grandmother's."
"a bagatelle, sophie."
now sophie looked at the envelope she had been given. it was addressed "to hilde."
she opened it and read aloud:
dear hilde, if the human brain was simple enough for us to understand, we would
still be so stupid that we couldn't understand it. love, dad.
alberto nodded. "true enough. i believe kant said something to that effect. we
cannot expect to understand what we are. maybe we can comprehend a flower or an
insect, but we can never comprehend ourselves. even less c

"now, i don't understand what you mean at all."
"people usually say, i'll believe that when i see it. but don't believe what you see,
either."
"you said something like that once before." 
"yes, about parmenides."
"but i still don't know what you mean."
"well, we sat out there on the step, talking. then that so-called sea serpent began to
flap about in the water."
"wasn't it peculiar!"
"not at all. then little red ridinghood came to the door. 'i'm looking for my
grandmother's house.' what a silly performance! it's just the major's tricks, sophie.

"do you think ... ?"
"but i said i had a plan. as long as we stick to our reason, he can't trick us. because in
a way we are free. he can let us 'perceive' all kinds of things; nothing would surprise

he birthday song, sophie. hilde is fifteen today."
"so am i." 
"you are, too, yes. let's sing then."
they both stood up and sang:
"happy birthday to you."
it was half-past four. sophie ran down to the water's edge and rowed over to the other
side. she pulled the boat up into the rushes and began to hurry through the woods.
when she reached the path, she suddenly noticed something moving between the trees.
she wondered if it was little red ridinghood wandering alone through the woods to
her grandmother's, but the figure between the trees was much smaller.
she went nearer. the figure was no bigger than a doll. it was brown and was wearing
a red sweater.
sophie stopped dead in her tracks when she realized it was a teddy bear.
that someone could have left a teddy bear in the forest was in itself no surprise. but
this teddy bear was alive, and seemed intensely preoccupied.
"hi," said sophie.
"my name is winnie-the-pooh," said the teddy bear, "and i have unfortunately lost my
way in the woods on t

looked at the
clock. it was almost three. she snuggled down under the covers and closed her eyes.
as she was falling asleep she wondered why her father had begun to write about little
red ridinghood and winnie-the-pooh ...
she slept until eleven o'clock the next morning. the tension in her body told her that
she had dreamed intensely all night, but she could not remember what she had
dreamed. it felt as if she had been in a totally different reality.
she went downstairs and fixed breakfast. her mother had put on her blue jumpsuit
ready to go down to the boathouse and work on the motorboat. even if it was not
afloat, it had to be shipshape when dad got back from lebanon.
"do you want to come down and give me a hand?"
"i have to read a little first. should i come down with some tea and a mid-morning
snack?"
"what mid-morning?"
when hilde had eaten she went back up to her room, made her bed, and sat herself
comfortably with the ring binder resting against her knees.

 the hedge and stood in the big garden which she had once
thought of as her own garden of eden . . .
there were branches and leaves strewn everywhere after the storm the night before. it
seemed to her that there was some connection between the storm and the fallen
branches and her meeting with little red ridinghood and winnie-the-pooh.
she went into the house. her mother had just gotten home and was putting some
bottles of soda in the refrigerator. on the table was a delicious-looking chocolate
cake. 
"are you expecting visitors?" asked sophie; she had almost forgotten it was her
birthday.
"we're having the real party next saturday, but i thought we ought to have a little
celebration today as well."
"how?"
"i have invited joanna and her parents."
"fine with me."
the visitors arrived shortly before half-past seven. the atmosphere was somewhat
formal--sophie's mo

and sophie amundsen (hostess)
the two girls went downstairs to their parents, who were now talking somewhat more
freely. sophie handed the draft invitation, written with a calligraphic pen, to her 
mother.
"could you make eighteen copies, please." it was not the first time she had asked her
mother to make photocopies for her at work.
her mother read the invitation and then handed it to joanna's father.
"you see what i mean? she is going a little crazy."
"but it looks really exciting," said joanna's father, handing the sheet on to his wife. "i
wouldn't mind coming to that party myself."
barbie read the invitation, then she said: "well, i must say! can we come too,
sophie?"
"let's say twenty copie

s, then," said sophie, taking them at their word.
"you must be nuts!" said joanna.
before sophie went to bed that night she stood for a long time gazing out of the
window. she remembered how she had once seen the outline of alberto's figure in the
darkness. it was more than a month ago. now it was again late at night, but this was a
white summer night.
sophie heard nothing from alberto until tuesday morning. he called just after her
mother had left for work.
"sophie amundsen."
"and alberto knox."
"i thought so."
"i'm sorry i didn't call before, but i've been working hard on our plan. i can only be
alone and work undisturbed when the major is concentrating wholly and com-pletely
on you."
 "that's weird." 
"then i seize the opportunity to conceal myself, you see. the best surveillance system
in the world has its limitations when it is only controlled by one single person ... i got
your card."
"you mean the invitation?"

"herder had been the forerunner, collecting folk songs from many lands under the

had only made alberto and sophie up, there were limits to the show of
power he ought to permit himself.
poor sophie and alberto! they were just as defenseless against the major's
imagination as a movie screen is against the film projector.
hilde would certainly teach him a lesson when he got home! she could already see
the outline of a really good plan.
she got up and went to look out over the bay. it was almost two o'clock. she opened
the window and called over toward the boathouse.
"mom!"
her mother came out.
"i'll be down with some sandwiches in about an hour. okay?" "fine." "i just have to
read a chapter on hegel."
alberto and sophie had seated themselves in the two chairs by the window facing the
lake.
"georg wilhelm friedrich hege/was a legitimate child of romanticism," began
alberto. "one could almost say he developed with the german spirit as it gradually
evolved in germany. he was born in stuttgart in 1770, and began to study theology in
tubingen at the age of eighteen. beginning in

"what kind of truths can they be?"
"if i say life is short, for example . . ."
"i would agree."
"but on another occasion i could throw open my arms and say life is long."
"you're right. that's also true, in a sense."
"finally i'll give you an example of how a dialectic tension can result in a
spontaneous act which leads to a sudden change."

"finally the girl's mother gets absolutely maddened by her daughter's overobedience,

...europe is on the road to bankruptcy...
hilde looked at her watch. it was already past four o'clock. she laid the ring binder on 
her desk and ran downstairs to the kitchen. she had to get down to the boathouse
before her mother got tired of waiting for her. she glanced at the brass mirror as she
passed.
she quickly put the kettle on for tea and fixed some sandwiches.
she had made up her mind to play a few tricks on her father. hilde was beginning to
feel more and more allied with sophie and alberto. her plan would start when he got
to copenhagen.
she went down to the boathouse with a large tray.
"here's our brunch," she said.
her mother was holding a block wrapped in sandpaper. she pushed a stray lock of
hair back fro

m her forehead. there was sand in her hair too.
"let's drop dinner, then."
they sat down outside on the dock and began to eat.
"when's dad arriving?" asked hilde after a while.
"on saturday. i thought you knew that."
"but what time? didn't you say he was changing planes in copenhagen?"
"that's right.
her mother took a bite of her sandwich.
"he gets to copenhagen at about five. the plane to kristiansand leaves at a quarter to
eight. he'll probably land at kjevik at half-past nine."
"so he has a few hours at kastrup ..."
"yes, why?" 
"nothing. i was just wondering."
when hilde thought a suitable interval had elapsed, she said casually, "have you
heard from anne and ole lately?"
"they call from time to time. they are coming home on vacation sometime in july."
"not before?"
"no, i don't think so."

and sophie had sung happy birthday to her. very embarrassing, hilde thought.
and now sophie had invited people to a philosophical garden party on the very day
her father was due back from lebanon. hilde was convinced something would
happen that day which neither she nor her father were quite sure of.
but one thing was certain: before her father got home to bjerkely he would get a scare.
that was the least she could do for sophie and alberto, especially after they had
appealed for help ...
her mother was still down in the boathouse. hilde ran downstairs to the telephone.
she found anne and ole's number in copenhagen and called them.
"anne kvamsdal."
"hi, this is hilde." 
"oh, how are you? how are things in lillesand?"
 "fine, with vacation and everything. and dad gets back from lebanon in a week."
"won't that be great, hilde!"
"yes, i'm looking forward to it. that's actually why i'm calling..."
"it is?"
"i think he's landing at kastrup around 5 p.m. on saturday the 23rd. will you be in

special favor. i'm not even sure if it's possible."
"now you're making me curious ..."
hilde began to describe her plan. she told anne about the ring binder, about sophie
and alberto and all the rest. she had to backtrack several times because either she or
anne were laughing too hard. but when hilde hung up, her plan was in operation.
she would now have to begin some preparations of her own. but there was still plenty
of time.
hilde spent the remainder of the afternoon and the evening with her mother. they
ended up driving to kris-tiansand and going to the movies. they felt they had some
catching up to do since they had not done anything special the day before. as they
drove past the exit to kjevik airport, a few more pieces of the big jigsaw puzzle hilde
was constructing fell into place.
it was late before she went to bed that night, but she took the ring binder and read on. 
when sophie slipped out of the den through the hedge it was almost eight o'clock.
her mother was weeding the flower

beds by the front door when sophie appeared.
"where did you spring from?"
"i came through the hedge."
"through the hedge?"
"didn't you know there was a path on the other side?"
"but where have you been, sophie? this is the second time you've just disappeared
without leaving any message."
"i'm sorry, mom. it was such a lovely day, i went for a long walk."
her mother rose from the pile of weeds and gave her a severe look.
"you haven't been with that philosopher again?"
"as a matter of fact, i have. i told you he likes going for long walks."
"but he is coming to the garden party, isn't he?"
"oh yes, he's looking forward to it."
"me too. i'm counting the days."
was there a touch of sharpness in her voice? to be on the safe side, sophie said:
"i'm glad i invited joanna's parents too. otherwise it might be a bit embarrassing."
"i don't know ... but whatever hap

 a talk with this alberto as
one adult to another."
"you can borrow my room if you like. i'm sure you'll like him." 
"and another thing. there's a letter for you."
"there is?"
"it's stamped un battalion."
"it must be from alberto's brother."
"it's got to stop, sophie!"
sophie's brain worked overtime. but in a flash she hit on a plausible answer it was as
though she was getting inspiration from some guiding spirit.
"i told alberto i collect rare postmarks. and brothers also have their uses."
her mother seemed to be reassured.
"dinner's in the fridge," she said in a slightly more amicable tone.
"where's the letter?"
"on top of the fridge."
sophie rushed inside. the envelope was stamped june 15, 1990. she opened it and
took out a little note:
what matters our creative endless toil, when at a snatch, oblivion ends the coil?
indeed, sophie had no answer to that question. before she ate, she put the note in the
closet together with all the other stuff she had collected in the past weeks. she would

learn soon enough why the question had been asked.
the following morning joanna came by. after a game of badminton, they got down to
planning the philosophical garden party. they needed to have some surprises on hand
in case the party flopped at any point.
when sophie's mother got home from work they were still talking about it. her
mother kept saying: "don't worry about what it costs." and she was not being 
sarcastic!
perhaps she was thinking that a "philosophical garden party" was just what was
needed to bring sophie down to earth again after her many weeks of intensive
philosophical studies.
before the evening was over they had agreed on everything, from paper lanterns to a
philosophical quiz with a prize. the prize should preferably be a book about
philosophy for young people. if there was such a thing! sophie was not at all

whole of his life--to the bourgeoisie."
"is it really that bad?"
"we're talking about marx, and we must therefore take our point of departure in the 
social conditions during the middle of the last century. so the answer must be a
resounding yes. the worker could have a 12-hour working day in a freezing cold
production hall. the pay was often so poor that children and expectant mothers also
had to work. this led to unspeakable social conditions. in many places, part of the
wages was paid out in the form of cheap liquor, and women were obliged to
supplement their earnings by prostitution. their customers were the respected
citizenry of the town. in short, in the precise situation that should have been the
honorable hallmark of mankind, namely work, the worker was turned into a beast of
burden."
"that infuriates me!"
"it infuriated marx too. and while it was happening, the chi

interpretation of the story of creation that toppled. the essence of darwin's theory was
the utterly random variations which had finally produced man. and what was more,
darwin had turned marv into a product of something as unsentimental as the struggle
for existence."
"did darwin have anything to say about how such random variations arose?" 
"you've put your finger on the weakest point in his theory. darwin had only the
vaguest idea of heredity. something happens in the crossing. a father and mother
never get two identical offspring. there is always some slight difference. on the other
hand it's difficult to produce anything really new in that way. moreover, there are
plants and animals which reproduce by budding or by simple cell division. on the
question of how the variations arise, darwin's theory has been supplemented by the
so-called neo-darwinism."
"what's that?"
"all life and all reproduction is basically a matter of cell division. when a cell divides
into two, two identical cells a

cell division, then, we say a cell copies itself."
"yes?"
"but occasionally, infinitesimal errors occur in the process, so that the copied cell is
not exactly the same as the mother cell. in modern biological terms, this is a mutation.
mutations are either totally irrelevant, or they can lead to marked changes in the
behavior of the individual. they can be directly harmful, and such 'mutants' will be
continually discarded from the large broods. many diseases are in fact due to
mutations. but sometimes a mutation can give an individual just that extra positive
characteristic needed to hold its own in the struggle for existence."

something eternal in her. but she didn't care for the way he was
dealing with sophie and alberto.
she would certainly teach him a lesson, even before he got home. she felt she owed it
to the two of them. hilde could already imagine her father at kastrup airport, in
copenhagen. she could just see him running around like mad. 
hilde was now quite herself again. she rowed the boat back to the dock, where she
was careful to make it fast. after breakfast she sat at the table for a long time with her
mother. it felt good to be able to talk about something as ordinary as whether the egg
was a trifle too soft.
she did not start to read again until the evening. there were not many pages left now.
once again there was a knocking on the door.
"let's just put our hands over our ears," said alberto, "and perhaps it'll go away."
"no, i want to see who it is."
alberto followed her to the door.
on the step stood a naked man. he had adopted a very ceremonial posture, but the
only thing he had with him was th

"how?"
"nowadays we know that infants like touching their sex organs. we can observe this
on any beach. in freud's time, this behavior could result in a slap over the fingers of
the two- or three-year-old, perhaps accompanied by the mother saying, 'naughty!' or

"do you think we'll make it?"
"we must. within a couple of days i shall give you a new horizon. then the major
will no longer know where the water voles are or where they will pop up next time."
"but even if we are only dream images, i am still my mother's daughter. and it's five

where the dream ended.
she remembered some lines of a poem by arnulf 0verland:

she was still standing at the window when her mother came in.
"hi there! are you already awake?"
"i'm not sure..."
"i'll be home around four, as usual."
"okay, mom."
"have a nice vacation day, hilde!" 
"you have a good day too."
when she heard her mother slam the front door, she slipped back into bed with the
ring binder.
"i'm going to dive down into the major's unconscious. that's where i'll be until we
meet again."
there, yes. hilde started reading again. she could feel under her right index finger
that there were only a few pages left.

so saying, the goose ran a few steps and flapped itself into the air.
sophie was exhausted, but when she crawled out of the den into the garden a little
later she thought alberto would have been well pleased with her diversionary
maneuvers. the major could not have thought much about alberto during the past
hour. if he did, he had to have a severe case of split personality.
sophie had just walked in the front door when her mother came home from work.
that saved her having to describe her rescue from a tall tree by a tame goose.
after dinner they began to get everything ready for the garden party. they brought a
four-meter-long table top and trestles from the attic and carried it into the garden.
they had planned to set out the long table under the fruit trees. the last time they had
used the trestle table had been on sophie's parents' tenth anniversary. sophie was only
eight years old at the time, but she clearly rememb

s it could be. there had not been as much as a drop
of rain since that horrid thunderstorm the day before sophie's birthday. nevertheless
they decided to leave the actual table setting and decorating until saturday morning.
later that evening they baked two different kinds of bread. they were going to serve
chicken and salad. and sodas. sophie was worried that some of the boys in her class
would bring beer. if there was one thing she was afraid of it was trouble.
as sophie was going to bed, her mother asked her once again if alberto was coming
to the party.
"of course he's coming. he has even promised to do a philosophical trick."
"a philosophical trick? what kind of trick is that?"
"no idea ... if he were a magician, he would have done a magic trick. he would 
probably have pulled a white rabbit out of a hat. . ."
"what, again?"
"but since he's a philosopher, he's going to do a philosophical trick instead. after all,
it is a philosophical garden party. are you planning to do something too?"

"actually, i am."
"a speech?"
"i'm not telling. good night, sophie!"
early the next morning sophie was woken up by her mother, who came in to say
goodbye before she went to work. she gave sophie a list of last-minute things to buy
in town for the garden party.
the minute her mother had left the house, the telephone rang. it was alberto. he had
obviously found out exactly when sophie was home alone.
"how is your secret coming along?"
"ssh! not a word. don't even give him the chance to think about it."
"i think i held his attention yesterday "
"good."

dered about most of all was sophie. sophie--who are you? where do
you come from? why have you come into my life?
finally sophie had been given a book about herself. was it the same book that hilde
now had in her hands? this was only a ring binder. but even so--how could one find a
book about oneself in a book about oneself? what would happen if sophie began to
read that book?
what was going to happen now? what could happen now? there were only a few
pages left in her ring binder.
sophie met her mother on the bus on her way home from town. oh, no! what would
her mother say when she saw the book in sophie's hand?
sophie tried to put it in the bag with all the streamers and balloons she had bought for
the party but she didn't quite make it.
"hi, sophie! we caught the same bus! how nice!"
"hi, mom!"
"you bought a book?"
"no, not exactly."
"sophie's world ... how curious."
sophie knew she didn't have the slightest chance of lying to her mother. 
"i got it from alberto."
"yes, i'm sure you did. as

"you really must stop all this! wasn't it a white rabbit?"
"you stop it!"
that was as far as they got before they reached their stop at the end of clover close.
they ran straight into a demonstration.
"my god!" exclaimed helene amundsen, "i really thought we would be spared street 
politics in this neighborhood."
there were no more than about ten or twelve people. their banners read:

sophie almost felt sorry for her mother.
"never mind," she said.
"but it was a peculiar demonstration, sophie. quite absurd, really."
"it was a mere bagatelle."
"the world changes more and more rapidly all the time. actually, i'm not in the least
surprised."
"you should be surprised that you're not surprised, at any rate."
 "not at all. they weren't violent, were they? i just hope they haven't trampled all
over our rosebeds. surely it can't be necessary to demonstrate in a garden. let's hurry
home and see."
"it was a philosophical de

e front of the house were hung with balloons. sophie and joanna had
spent most of the afternoon blowing them up.
the table was set with chicken, salad, and different kinds of homemade bread. in the
kitchen there were raisin buns and layer cake, danish pastry and chocolate cake. but
from the start the place of honor in the center of the table was reserved for the
birthday cake--a pyramid of almond-paste rings. on the top of the cake was the tiny
figure of a girl in a confirmation dress. sophie's mother had assured her that it could
just as well represent an unconfirmed fifteen-year-old, but sophie was certain her
mother had only put it there because sophie had told her she was not sure she wanted
to be confirmed. her mother seemed to think the cake embodied the confirmation
itself.
"we haven't spared any expense," she repeated several times in the half hour before
the party was due to start.
the guests began to arrive. first came three of the girls from sophie's class, dressed in
summer shirt

had brought birthday presents, and as it was a philosophical garden party,
several of the guests had tried to find out what philosophy was. although not all of
them had managed to find philosophical presents, most of them had written something
philosophical on their cards. sophie received a philosophical dictionary as well as a
diary with a lock; on the cover was written my personal philosophical
thoughts. as the guests arrived they were served apple juice in long-stemmed
wine glasses. sophie's mother did the serving. 
"welcome ... and what is this young man's name? i don't believe we've met before ...
so glad you could come, cecilie . . ."
when all the younger guests had arrived and were strolling under the trees with their
wine glasses, joanna's parents drew up at the garden gate in a white mercedes. the
financial adviser was impeccably dressed in an expensively cut gray suit. his wife
was wearing a red pants suit with dark red sequins. sophie was sure she had bought a
barbie doll in a toy

rigtsen family. sophie tried hard to maintain her composure when it
turned out to be--yes, it was!--a barbie doll. but joanna made no such effort:
"are you crazy? sophie doesn't play with dolls!"
mrs. ingebrigtsen came hurrying over, with all her sequins clanking. "but it's only for
decoration, you know."
"well, thank you very much indeed." sophie tried to smooth things over. "now i can
start ft collection."
people began to drift toward the table.
"we're only waiting for alberto," said sophie's mother to her in a somewhat brisk
tone that was intended to hide her growing apprehension. rumors of the special guest
of honor had already spread among the other guests.
"he has promised to come, so he'll come."
"but we can't seat the guests before he arrives, can we?"
"of course we can. let's go ahead."
helene amundsen began to seat people around the long table. she made sure that the 
vacant chair was between her own and sophie's place. she said a few words about the
beautiful weather and the fact

gate. he was carrying a bouquet of fifteen red roses.
"alberto!"
sophie left the table and ran to greet him. she threw her arms around his neck and
took the bouquet from him. he responded to the welcome by rooting around in his
jacket pocket and drawing out a couple of chinese firecrackers which he lit and tossed
into the yard. as. he approached the table, he lit a sparkler and set it on top of the
almond pyramid. then he went over and stood at the empty place between sophie and
her mother.
"i'm delighted to be here," he said.
the guests were dumbstruck. mrs. ingebrigtsen gave her husband a significant look.
sophie's mother was so relieved that the man had finally arrived, however, that she
would have forgiven him anything. sophie herself was struggling to suppress her
laughter.
helene amundsen tapped on her glass and said:
"let us also welcome alberto knox to this philosophical garden party. he is not my
new boyfriend, because although my husband is so often away at sea, i don't

 trying to topple her backward over the table so as to get a better grip as
he returned her kiss.
"well, i've never ..." exclaimed mrs. ingebrigtsen.
"not on the table, children," was mrs. amundsen's only comment.
"why not?" asked alberto, turning toward her.
"that was an odd question."
"it's never wrong for a real philosopher to ask questions."
a couple of the other boys who had not been kissed started to throw chicken bones up
on the roof. this, too, elicited only a mild comment from sophie's mother:
"would you mind not doing that. it's such a nuisance when there are chicken bones in
the gutter."
"sorry," said one of the boys, whereupon they started throwing chicken bones over the
garden hedge instead.
"i think it's time to clear the plates away and serve the cake," said mrs. amundsen
finally. "sophie and joanna, will you give me a hand?"
on their way to the kitchen there was only time for a brief discussion.
"what made you kiss him?" sophie said to joanna.
"i sat looking at his mouth and

couldn't resist it. he is so cute!"
"how did it taste?"
"not exactly like i'd imagined, but. . ."
"it was the first time, then?" 
"but not the last!"
coffee and cake were soon on the table. alberto had started giving the boys some of
his firecrackers when sophie's mother tapped on her coffee cup.
"i am not going to make a long speech," she began, "but i only have this one daughter,
and it is only this once that exactly one week and a day ago she reached the age of
fifteen. as you see, we have spared no expense. there are twenty-four almond rings
on the birthday cake, so there's at least one whole ring for each of you. those who
help themselves first can take two rings, because we start from the top and the rings
get bigger and bigger as you go. that's the way i

t is in life too. when sophie was a
little girl, she went tripping around in tiny little rings. but as the years went by, the
rings got bigger and bigger. now they reach right over to the old town and back. and
what is more, with a father who is at sea so much, she makes calls to all parts of the
world. we congratulate you on your fifteenth birthday, sophie!"
"delightful!" exclaimed mrs. ingebrigtsen.
sophie was not sure whether she was referring to her mother, the speech, the birthday
cake, or sophie herself.
the guests applauded, and one of the boys threw a firecracker up into the pear tree.
joanna left the table and pulled jeremy up off his chair. they lay down on the grass
and started kissing each other again. after a while they rolled in under the red-currant
bushes.
"nowadays it's the girl who takes the initiative," said mr. ingebrigtsen.
having said that, he got up and went over to the red-currant bushes where he stood
observing the phenomenon

aware, insurance doesn't cover those either."
"this is not a natural catastrophe."
"no, it is an existential catastrophe. for example, just take a look under the currant
bushes and you will see what i mean. you cannot insure yourself against the collapse
of your whole life. neither can you insure yourself against the sun going out."
"do we have to put up with this?" asked joanna's father, looking at his wife.
she shook her head, and so did sophie's mother.
"what a shame," she said, "and after we had spared no expense."
the younger guests continued to look at alberto. "we want to hear more," said a
curly-haired boy with glasses.
"thank you, but there is not much more to say. when you have realized that you are a
dream image in another person's sleepy consciousness, then, in my opinion, it is
wisest to be silent. but i can finish by recommending that you take a short course in
the history of philosophy. it is important to be critical of the older

nce whether you deal with this situation or not, since you are
nothing but a shadow. anyway, sophie and i are about to leave the party, since for us
the philosophy course has not been purely theoretical. it has also had its practical side.
when the time is ripe we will perform our disappearing act. that is how we are going
to sneak our way out of the major's consciousness."
helene amundsen took hold of her daughter's arm.
"you are not leaving me, are you, sophie?"
sophie put her arms around her mother. she looked up at alberto.
"mom is so sad . . ."
"no, that's just ridiculous. don't forget what you have learned. it's this sort of
nonsense we must liberate ourselves from. your mother is a sweet and kind lady, just
as the little red ridinghood who came to my door that day had a basket filled with
food for her grandmother. your mother is no more sad than the plane that just flew
over needed fuel for its congratulation maneuvers."
"i think i see what you mean," said sophie, and turned back to h

er mother. "that's
why i have to do what he says, mom. one day i had to leave you."
"i'm going to miss you," said her mother, "but if there is a heaven over this one, you'll
just have to fly. i promise to take good care of govinda. does it eat one or two lettuce
leaves a day?"
alberto put his hand on her shoulder.
"neither you nor anyone else here will miss us for the simple reason that you do not
exist. you are no more than shadows."
"that is the worst insult i've ever heard," mrs. ingebrigtsen burst out. 
her husband nodded.
"if nothing else, we can always get him nailed for defamation of character. i'm sure
he's a

re grubby and crumpled. joanna's golden hair was caked with mud and
earth.
"mom, i'm going to have a baby," she announced.
"all right, but you'll have to wait till you get home."
she had immediate support from her husband. "she'll simply have to contain herself,"
he said. "and if there is to be a christening tonight, she'll have to arrange it herself."
alberto looked down at sophie with a somber expression.
"it's time."
"can't you at least bring us a little more coffee before you go?" asked her mother.
"of course, mom, i'll do it right away."
sophie took the thermos from the table. she had to make more coffee. while she
stood waiting for it to brew, she fed the birds and the goldfish. she also went into the
bathroom and put a lettuce leaf out for govinda. she couldn't see the cat anywhere,
but she opened a large can of cat food, emptied it into a bowl and set it out on the step.
she felt her tears welling up.
when she returned with the coffee, the garden party looked more like a children's

chocolate cake smeared all over the tablecloth
and the dish of raisin buns lay upside down on the lawn. just as sophie arrived, one of
the boys put a firecracker to the layer cake, which exploded all over the table and the 
guests. the worst casualty was mrs. ingebrigtsen's red pants suit. the curious thing
was that both she and everybody else took it with the utmost calm. joanna picked up a
huge piece of chocolate cake, smeared it all over jeremy's face, and proceeded to lick
it off again.
her mother and alberto were sitting in the glider a little way away from the others.
they waved to sophie.
"so you finally had your confidential talk," said sophie.
"and you were perfectly right," said her mother, quite elated now. "alberto is a very
altruistic person. i entrust you to his strong arms."
sophie sat down between them.
two of the boys had managed to climb onto the roof. one of the girls went around
pricking holes in all the balloons with a hairpin. then an uninvited guest arrived on a

 was not a story one could be done with after a
single reading. new thoughts about what could have happened to sophie and alberto
when they left the garden party were constantly occurring to her.
on saturday, june 23, she awoke with a start around nine o'clock. she knew her father
had already left the camp in lebanon. now it was just a question of waiting. the last
part of his day was planned down to the smallest detail.
later in the morning she began the preparations for midsummer eve with her mother.
hilde could not help thinking of how sophie and her mother had arranged their
midsummer eve party. but that was something they had done. it was over, finished.
or was it? were they going around right now, decorating everywhere?
sophie and alberto seated themselves on a lawn in front of two large buildings with
ugly air vents and ventilation canals on the outside. a young couple came walking out
of one of the buildings. he was carrying a brown briefcase and she had a red handbag
slung over one

berto, "but
unfortunately we are in a hurry. can we come back and pay some other day?"
"of course. and why are you in a hurry?"
alberto explained their errand, and the old woman commented:
 "i must say, you certainly are a pair of greenhorns. you'd better hurry up and cut the
umbilical cord to your mortal progenitor. we no longer need their world. we belong to
the invisible people."
alberto and sophie hurried back to the cinderella cafeteria and the red convertible.
right next to the car a busy mother was helping her little boy to pee.
racing along and taking shortcuts, they soon arrived in lillesand.
sk 876 from copenhagen touched down at kjevik on schedule at 9:35 p.m. while the
plane was taxied out to the runway in copenhagen, the.major had opened the
envelope hanging from the check-in desk. the note inside read:

1990. dear dad, you probably thought i would turn up in copenhagen. but my

repared everything. mom's doing the serving."
then they had to go over the ring binder and the story of sophie and alberto from one
end to the other and backwards and forwards.
mom brought out the turkey and the waldorf salad, the rose wine and hilde's
homemade bread.
her father was just saying something about plato when hilde suddenly interrupted
him: "shh!"
"what is it?"
"didn't you hear it? something squeaking?"
"no."
"i'm sure i heard something. i guess it was just a field mouse."
while her mother went to get another bottle of wine, her father said: "but the
philosophy course isn't quite over." 
"it isn't?"
"tonight i'm going to tell you about the universe."
before they began to eat, he said to his wife, "hilde is too big to sit on my knee any
more. but you're not!" with that he caught marit round the waist and drew her onto
his lap. it was quite a while before she got anything to eat.
"to think you'll soon be forty ..."
when hilde jumped up and ran toward her father, sophie felt her tea
