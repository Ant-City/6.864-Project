[CHARACTER]
despite his stern manner and not particularly handsome
appearance, [CHARACTER] wins jane's heart, because she feels
they are kindred spirits, and because he is the first person in
the novel to offer jane lasting love and a real home. although rochester
is jane's social and economic superior, and although men were widely
considered to be naturally superior to women in the victorian period, jane
is rochester's intellectual equal. moreover, after their marriage is
interrupted by the disclosure that rochester is already married
to bertha mason, jane is proven to be rochester's moral superior.
rochester regrets his former libertinism and lustfulness;
nevertheless, he has proven himself to be weaker in many ways than
jane. jane feels that living with rochester as his mistress would
mean the loss of her dignity. ultimately, she would become degraded
and dependent upon rochester for love, while unprotected by any
true marriage bond. jane will only enter into marriage with rochester after
she has gained a fortune and a family, and after she has been on the
verge of abandoning passion altogether. she waits until she is not unduly
influenced by her own poverty, loneliness, psychological vulnerability,
or passion. additionally, because rochester has been blinded by
the fire and has lost his manor house at the end of the novel, he
has become weaker while jane has grown in strength--jane claims that
they are equals, but the marriage dynamic has actually tipped in
her favor.
