the life of timon of athens

enter poet, painter, ieweller, merchant, and mercer, at seuerall
doores.

  poet. good day sir

   pain. i am glad y'are well

   poet. i haue not seene you long, how goes
the world?
  pain. it weares sir, as it growes

   poet. i that's well knowne:
but what particular rarity? what strange,
which manifold record not matches: see
magicke of bounty, all these spirits thy power
hath coniur'd to attend.
i know the merchant

   pain. i know them both: th' others a ieweller

   mer. o 'tis a worthy lord

   iew. nay that's most fixt

   mer. a most incomparable man, breath'd as it were,
to an vntyreable and continuate goodnesse:
he passes

it staines the glory in that happy verse,
which aptly sings the good

   iewel. and rich: heere is a water looke ye

   pain. you are rapt sir, in some worke, some dedication
to the great lord

   poet. a thing slipt idlely from me.
our poesie is as a gowne, which vses
from whence 'tis nourisht: the fire i'th' flint
shewes not, till it be strooke: our gentle flame
prouokes it selfe, and like the currant flyes
each bound it chases. what haue you there?
  pain. a picture sir: when comes your booke forth?
  poet. vpon the heeles of my presentment sir.
let's see your peece

speakes his owne standing: what a mentall power
this eye shootes forth? how bigge imagination
moues in this lip, to th' dumbnesse of the gesture,
one might interpret

   pain. it is a pretty mocking of the life:
heere is a touch: is't good?

it tutors nature, artificiall strife
liues in these toutches, liuelier then life.

   po. you see this confluence, this great flood of visitors,
i haue in this rough worke, shap'd out a man
whom this beneath world doth embrace and hugge
with amplest entertainment: my free drift
halts not particularly, but moues it selfe
in a wide sea of wax, no leuell'd malice
infects one comma in the course i hold,
but flies an eagle flight, bold, and forth on,
leauing no tract behinde

  poet. i will vnboult to you.
you see how all conditions, how all mindes,
as well of glib and slipp'ry creatures, as
of graue and austere qualitie, tender downe
their seruices to lord timon: his large fortune,
vpon his good and gracious nature hanging,
subdues and properties to his loue and tendance
all sorts of hearts; yea, from the glasse-fac'd flatterer
to apemantus, that few things loues better
then to abhorre himselfe; euen hee drops downe
the knee before him, and returnes in peace

st rich in timons nod

   pain. i saw them speake together

   poet. sir, i haue vpon a high and pleasant hill
feign'd fortune to be thron'd.
the base o'th' mount
is rank'd with all deserts, all kinde of natures
that labour on the bosome of this sphere,
to propagate their states; among'st them all,
whose eyes are on this soueraigne lady fixt,
one do i personate of lord timons frame,
whom fortune with her iuory hand wafts to her,
whose present grace, to present slaues and seruants
translates his riuals

this throne,

 this fortune, and this hill me thinkes
with one man becken'd from the rest below,
bowing his head against the sleepy mount
to climbe his happinesse, would be well exprest
in our condition

   poet. nay sir, but heare me on:
all those which were his fellowes but of late,
some better then his valew; on the moment
follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,
raine sacrificiall whisperings in his eare,
make sacred euen his styrrop, and through him
drinke the free ayre

   pain. i marry, what of these?
  poet. when fortune in her shift and change of mood
spurnes downe her late beloued; all his dependants
which labour'd after him to the mountaines top,

   tim. this gentleman of mine
hath seru'd me long:
to build his fortune, i will straine a little,
for 'tis a bond in men. giue him thy daughter,

go not away. what haue you there, my friend?
  pain. a peece of painting, which i do beseech
your lordship to accept

   tim. painting is welcome.
the painting is almost the naturall man:
for since dishonor traffickes with mans nature,
he is but out-side: these pensil'd figures are
euen such as they giue out. i like your worke,
and you shall finde i like it; waite attendance

the plague of company light vpon thee:

and may diseases licke vp their false bloods,
and so farewell, and thriue

does the rumor hold for true,
that hee's so full of gold?

g else:
you shall see him a palme in athens againe,
and flourish with the highest:
therefore, 'tis not amisse, we tender our loues
to him, in this suppos'd distresse of his:
it will shew honestly in vs,
and is very likely, to loade our purposes
with what they trauaile for,
if it be a iust and true report, that goes
of his hauing

   poet. what haue you now
to present vnto him?
  painter. nothing at this time
but my visitation: onely i will promise him
an excellent peece

   poet. i must serue him so too;
tell him of an intent that's comming toward him

   painter. good as the best.
promising, is the verie ayre o'th' time;
it opens the eyes of expectation.
performance, is euer the duller for his acte,
and but in the plainer and simpler kinde of people,
the deede of saying is quite out of vse.
to promise, is most courtly and fashionable;
performance, is a kinde of will or testament
which argues a great sicknesse in his iudgement
that makes it.

om his caue.

  timon. excellent workeman,
thou canst not paint a man so badde
as is thy selfe

   poet. i am thinking
what i shall say i haue prouided for him:
it must be a personating of himselfe:
a satyre against the softnesse of prosperity,
with a discouerie of the infinite flatteries
that follow youth and opulencie

   timon. must thou needes
stand for a villaine in thine owne worke?
wilt thou whip thine owne faults in other men?
do so, i haue gold for thee

   poet. nay let's seeke him.
then do we sinne against our owne estate,
when we may profit meete, and come too late

   painter. true:
when the day serues before blacke-corner'd night;
finde what thou want'st, by free and offer'd light.
come

what a gods gold, that he is worshipt
in a baser temple, then where swine feede?

to see two honest men?
  poet. sir:
hauing often of your open bounty tasted,
hearing you were retyr'd, your friends falne off,
whose thankelesse natures (o abhorred spirits)
not all the whippes of heauen, are large enough.
what, to you,
whose starre-like noblenesse gaue life and influence
to their whole being? i am rapt, and cannot couet
the monstrous bulke of this ingratitude
with any size of words

naked men may see't the better:
you that are honest, by being what you are,
