Sauron - 
                    	The
Dark Lord of Mordor, the primary antagonist in The Lord
of the Rings. Sauron, who created the One Ring, is driven
only by his desire to retrieve the Ring. He never appears during
the novel; we see only his Great Eye and his Dark Tower in Mordor.
Sauron's rule has made the land of Mordor barren and inhospitable.
