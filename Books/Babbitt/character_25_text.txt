 their house came midnight music and obscene laughter;
there were neighborhood rumors of bootlegged whisky and fast motor
rides. they furnished babbitt with many happy evenings of discussion,
during which he announced firmly, "i'm not strait-laced, and i don't
mind seeing a fellow throw in a drink once in a while, but when it comes
to deliberately trying to get away with a lot of hell-raising all the
while like the doppelbraus do, it's too rich for my blood!"

on the other side of babbitt lived howard littlefield, ph.d., in a
strictly modern house whereof the lower part was dark red tapestry
brick, with a leaded oriel, the upper part of pale stucco like spattered
clay, and the roof red-tiled. littlefield was the great scholar of the
neighborhood; the authority on everything in the world except babies,
cooking, and motors. he was a bachelor of arts of blodgett college,
and a doctor of philosophy in economics of yale. he was the
employment-manager and publicity-counsel of the zenith street traction

but littlefield's great value was as a spiritual example. despite
his strange learnings he was as strict a presbyterian and as firm a
republican as george f. babbitt. he confirmed the business men in the
faith. where they knew only by passionate instinct that their system of
industry and manners was perfect, dr. howard littlefield proved it
to them, out of history, economics, and the confessions of reformed
radicals.

babbitt had a good deal of honest pride in being the neighbor of such a
savant, and in ted's intimacy with eunice littlefield. at sixteen
eunice was interested in no statistics save those regarding the ages
and salaries of motion-picture stars, but--as babbitt definitively put
it--"she was her father's daughter."

at one end of the room was a heraldic and hooded stone fireplace which
the club's advertising-pamphlet asserted to be not only larger than any
of the fireplaces in european castles but of a draught incomparably more
scientific. it was also much cleaner, as no fire had ever been built in
it.

half of the tables were mammoth slabs which seated twenty or thirty men.
babbitt usually sat at the one near the door, with a group including
gunch, finkelstein, professor pumphrey, howard littlefield, his
neighbor, t. cholmondeley frink, the poet and advertising-agent, and
orville jones, whose laundry was in many ways the best in zenith. they
composed a club within the club, and merrily called themselves "the
roughnecks." to-day as he passed their table the roughnecks greeted him,
"come on, sit in! you 'n' paul too proud to feed with poor folks? afraid
somebody might stick you for a bottle of bevo, george? strikes me you
swells are getting awful darn exclusive!"

he stopped to inform howard littlefield, his scholarly neighbor, that
though the day had been springlike the evening might be cold. he went in
to shout "where are you?" at his wife, with no very definite desire to
know where she was. he examined the lawn to see whether the furnace-man
had raked it properly. with some satisfaction and a good deal of
discussion of the matter with mrs. babbitt, ted, and howard littlefield,
he concluded that the furnace-man had not raked it properly. he cut two

the professions. they're too crowded already, and what'll we do for
workmen if all those fellows go and get educated?"

ted was leaning back, smoking a cigarette without reproof. he was, for
the moment, sharing the high thin air of babbitt's speculation as though
he were paul riesling or even dr. howard littlefield. he hinted:

"well, what do you think then, dad? wouldn't it be a good idea if i
could go off to china or some peppy place, and study engineering or

but a dinner of twelve, with flowers from the florist's and all the
cut-glass out, staggered even the babbitts.

for two weeks they studied, debated, and arbitrated the list of guests.

babbitt marveled, "of course we're up-to-date ourselves, but still,
think of us entertaining a famous poet like chum frink, a fellow that on
nothing but a poem or so every day and just writing a few advertisements
pulls down fifteen thousand berries a year!"

"yes, and howard littlefield. do you know, the other evening eunice told
me her papa speaks three languages!" said mrs. babbitt.

"huh! that's nothing! so do i--american, baseball, and poker!"

"i don't think it's nice to be funny about a matter like that. think how
wonderful it must be to speak three languages, and so useful and--and
with people like that, i don't see why we invite the orville joneses."

"well now, orville is a mighty up-and-coming fellow!"

persuade "as slow a bunch as myra and the littlefields to go some place
aft' dinner and raise cain and maybe dig up smore booze." he perceived
that he had gifts of profligacy which had been neglected.

by the time the guests had come, including the inevitable late couple
for whom the others waited with painful amiability, a great gray
emptiness had replaced the purple swirling in babbitt's head, and he had
to force the tumultuous greetings suitable to a host on floral heights.

the guests were howard littlefield, the doctor of philosophy who
furnished publicity and comforting economics to the street traction
company; vergil gunch, the coal-dealer, equally powerful in the elks
and in the boosters' club; eddie swanson the agent for the javelin motor
car, who lived across the street; and orville jones, owner of the lily
white laundry, which justly announced itself "the biggest, busiest,
bulliest cleanerie shoppe in zenith." but, naturally, the most
distinguished of all was t. cholmondeley frink, who was n

their trousers-pockets, and proclaimed their views with the booming
profundity of a prosperous male repeating a thoroughly hackneyed
statement about a matter of which he knows nothing whatever.

"now, i'll tell you," said vergil gunch; "way i figure it is this, and
i can speak by the book, because i've talked to a lot of doctors and
fellows that ought to know, and the way i see it is that it's a good
thing to get rid of the saloon, but they ought to let a fellow have beer
and light wines."

howard littlefield observed, "what isn't generally realized is that it's
a dangerous prop'sition to invade the rights of personal liberty.
now, take this for instance: the king of--bavaria? i think it was
bavaria--yes, bavaria, it was--in 1862, march, 1862, he issued a
proclamation against public grazing of live-stock. the peasantry had
stood for overtaxation without the slightest complaint, but when this
proclamation came out, they rebelled. or it may have been saxony. but

liberty."

"that's it--no one got a right to invade personal liberty," said orville
jones.

"just the same, you don't want to forget prohibition is a mighty good
thing for the working-classes. keeps 'em from wasting their money and
lowering their productiveness," said vergil gunch.

"yes, that's so. but the trouble is the manner of enforcement," insisted
howard littlefield. "congress didn't understand the right system. now,
if i'd been running the thing, i'd have arranged it so that the drinker
himself was licensed, and then we could have taken care of the shiftless
workman--kept him from drinking--and yet not 've interfered with the
rights--with the personal liberty--of fellows like ourselves."

they bobbed their heads, looked admiringly at one another, and stated,
"that's so, that would be the stunt."

"the thing that worries me is that a lot of these guys will

they can't talk about anything but the weather and the ne-oo ford, by

"that's right. they all talk about just the same things," said eddie
swanson.

"don't they, though! they just say the same things over and over," said
vergil gunch.

"yes, it's really remarkable. they seem to lack all power of looking at
things impersonally. they simply go over and over the same talk about
fords and the weather and so on." said howard littlefield.

"still, at that, you can't blame 'em. they haven't got any intellectual
stimulus such as you get up here in the city," said chum frink.

"gosh, that's right," said babbitt. "i don't want you highbrows to get
stuck on yourselves but i must say it keeps a fellow right up on his

he would, except for his guests, have fled outdoors and walked off the
intoxication of food, but in the haze which filled the room they sat
forever, talking, talking, while he agonized, "darn fool to be eating
all this--not 'nother mouthful," and discovered that he was again
tasting the sickly welter of melted ice cream on his plate. there was
no magic in his friends; he was not uplifted when howard littlefield
produced from his treasure-house of scholarship the information that the
chemical symbol for raw rubber is c10h16, which turns into isoprene,
or 2c5h8. suddenly, without precedent, babbitt was not merely bored but
admitting that he was bored. it was ecstasy to escape from the table,
from the torture of a straight chair, and loll on the davenport in the
living-room.

the others, from their fitful unconvincing talk, their expressions of
being slowly and painfully smothered, seemed to be suffering

the present speaker has finished, she is going to remark brightly to
her husband, "well, dear, i think per-haps it's about time for us to

efforts to keep the party going. he had--there was something he wished
to think out--but the psychical research had started them off again.
("why didn't they go home! why didn't they go home!") though he
was impressed by the profundity of the statement, he was only
half-enthusiastic when howard littlefield lectured, "the united states
is the only nation in which the government is a moral ideal and not just
a social arrangement." ("true--true--weren't they ever going home?") he
was usually delighted to have an "inside view" of the momentous world of
motors but to-night he scarcely listened to eddie swanson's revelation:

buy. couple weeks ago, and mind you, this was a fair, square test, they

dressed, he thought aloud: "jever stop to consider, myra, that before

jever realize that?" at the athletic club he led unwilling men aside to
inquire, "say, if you had to read a paper before a big convention, would
you start in with the funny stories or just kind of scatter 'em all
through?" he asked howard littlefield for a "set of statistics about
real-estate sales; something good and impressive," and littlefield
provided something exceedingly good and impressive.

but it was to t. cholmondeley frink that babbitt most often turned. he
caught frink at the club every noon, and demanded, while frink
looked hunted and evasive, "say, chum--you're a shark on this
writing stuff--how would you put this sentence, see here in my
manuscript--manuscript now where the deuce is that?--oh, yes, here.

abbitt interrupted his observations with,
"yes--perhaps--i think i'll try to get some lynnhaven oysters," and
when she was quite ready she invited dr. j. t. angus, the oculist, and a
dismally respectable lawyer named maxwell, with their glittering wives.

neither angus nor maxwell belonged to the elks or to the athletic club;
neither of them had ever called babbitt "brother" or asked his opinions
on carburetors. the only "human people" whom she invited, babbitt
raged, were the littlefields; and howard littlefield at times became so
statistical that babbitt longed for the refreshment of gunch's, "well,
old lemon-pie-face, what's the good word?"

immediately after lunch mrs. babbitt began to set the table for the
seven-thirty dinner to the mckelveys, and babbitt was, by order, home at
four. but they didn't find anything for him to do, and three times mrs.
babbitt scolded, "do please try to keep out of the way!" he stood in the
door of the garage, his lips drooping, and wished that littlefield or

nd their uniformed chauffeur, waiting in front.

the dinner was well cooked and incredibly plentiful, and mrs. babbitt
had brought out her grandmother's silver candlesticks. babbitt worked
hard. he was good. he told none of the jokes he wanted to tell. he
listened to the others. he started maxwell off with a resounding, "let's
hear about your trip to the yellowstone." he was laudatory, extremely
laudatory. he found opportunities to remark that dr. angus was a
benefactor to humanity, maxwell and howard littlefield profound
scholars, charles mckelvey an inspiration to ambitious youth, and mrs.
mckelvey an adornment to the social circles of zenith, washington, new
york, paris, and numbers of other places.

but he could not stir them. it was a dinner without a soul. for no
reason that was clear to babbitt, heaviness was over them and they spoke
laboriously and unwillingly.

he concentrated on lucille mckelvey, carefully not looking at her
blanched lovely shoulder and the tawny silken bared which supported h

babbitt said bravely, "i hope they don't invite us to meet this lord
doak guy. darn sight rather just have a nice quiet little dinner with
charley and the missus."

at the zenith athletic club they discussed it amply. "i s'pose we'll
have to call mckelvey 'lord chaz' from now on," said sidney finkelstein.

"it beats all get-out," meditated that man of data, howard littlefield,
"how hard it is for some people to get things straight. here they call
this fellow 'lord doak' when it ought to be 'sir gerald.'"

babbitt marvelled, "is that a fact! well, well! 'sir gerald,' eh? that's
what you call um, eh? well, sir, i'm glad to know that."

later he informed his salesmen, "it's funnier 'n a goat the way

manual training, basket-ball, and the organization of dances, ted was
struggling through his senior year in the east side high school. at home
he was interested only when he was asked to trace some subtle ill in the
ignition system of the car. he repeated to his tut-tutting father that
he did not wish to go to college or law-school, and babbitt was equally
disturbed by this "shiftlessness" and by ted's relations with eunice
littlefield, next door.

though she was the daughter of howard littlefield, that wrought-iron
fact-mill, that horse-faced priest of private ownership, eunice was
a midge in the sun. she danced into the house, she flung herself into
babbitt's lap when he was reading, she crumpled his paper, and laughed
at him when he adequately explained that he hated a crumpled newspaper
as he hated a broken sales-contract. she was seventeen now. her ambition
was to be a cinema actress. she did not merely attend the showing of
every "feature film;" she also read the motion-picture mag

he announced that he would be enchanted to have ted left out of things,
and hurried in to be polite, lest ted be left out of things.

but, he resolved, if he found that the boys were drinking, he
would--well, he'd "hand 'em something that would surprise 'em." while
he was trying to be agreeable to large-shouldered young bullies he was
earnestly sniffing at them twice he caught the reek of prohibition-time
whisky, but then, it was only twice--

dr. howard littlefield lumbered in.

he had come, in a mood of solemn parental patronage, to look on. ted and
eunice were dancing, moving together like one body. littlefield gasped.
he called eunice. there was a whispered duologue, and littlefield
explained to babbitt that eunice's mother had a headache and needed her.
she went off in tears. babbitt looked after them furiously. "that little
devil! getting ted into trouble! and littlefield, the conceited old
gas-bag, acting like it was ted that was the bad influence!"

in particular.

one evening when tanis was at the theater, babbitt found himself being
lively with the doppelbraus, pledging friendship with men whom he
had for years privily denounced to mrs. babbitt as a "rotten bunch of
tin-horns that i wouldn't go out with, rot if they were the last people
on earth." that evening he had sulkily come home and poked about in
front of the house, chipping off the walk the ice-clots, like fossil
footprints, made by the steps of passers-by during the recent snow.
howard littlefield came up snuffling.

"still a widower, george?"

"yump. cold again to-night."

"what do you hear from the wife?"

"she's feeling fine, but her sister is still pretty sick."

"say, better come in and have dinner with us to-night, george."

"oh--oh, thanks. have to go out."

suddenly he could not endure littlefield's recitals of the more
interesting statistics about totally uninteresting problems. he scraped
at the walk and grunted.

sam doppelbrau appeared.

"evenin', babbitt. working hard?"

"well--from the way you say it, i suppose it's my fault you went there!

"you did!"

"well, upon my word--"

"you hate 'strange people' as you call 'em. if you had your way, i'd be

to have anybody with any git to 'em at the house; you want a bunch of

of the hospital in seventeen days. he went to see her each
afternoon, and in their long talks they drifted back to intimacy. once
he hinted something of his relations to tanis and the bunch, and she was
inflated by the view that a wicked woman had captivated her poor george.

if once he had doubted his neighbors and the supreme charm of the good
fellows, he was convinced now. you didn't, he noted, "see seneca doane
coming around with any flowers or dropping in to chat with the missus,"
but mrs. howard littlefield brought to the hospital her priceless wine
jelly (flavored with real wine); orville jones spent hours in picking
out the kind of novels mrs. babbitt liked--nice love stories about new
york millionaries and wyoming cowpunchers; louetta swanson knitted a
pink bed-jacket; sidney finkelstein and his merry brown-eyed flapper of
a wife selected the prettiest nightgown in all the stock of parcher and
stein.

all his friends ceased whispering about him, suspecting him. at the
athletic club they asked a

babbitt turned on the light in ted's room. it was a brown boyish room;
disordered dresser, worn books, a high-school pennant, photographs of
basket-ball teams and baseball teams. ted was decidedly not there.

mrs. babbitt, awakened, irritably observed that she certainly did not
know the name of ted's host, that it was late, that howard littlefield
was but little better than a born fool, and that she was sleepy. but
she remained awake and worrying while babbitt, on the sleeping-porch,
struggled back into sleep through the incessant soft rain of her
remarks. it was after dawn when he was aroused by her shaking him and
calling "george! george!" in something like horror.

"wha--wha--what is it?"

"come here quick and see. be quiet!"

she led him down the hall to the door of ted's room and pushed it gently
open. on the worn brown rug he saw a

"we got married last evening. wife! sit up and say a pretty good morning
to mother-in-law."

but eunice hid her shoulders and her charming wild hair under the
pillow.

by nine o'clock the assembly which was gathered about ted and eunice
in the living-room included mr. and mrs. george babbitt, dr. and mrs.
howard littlefield, mr. and mrs. kenneth escott, mr. and mrs. henry
t. thompson, and tinka babbitt, who was the only pleased member of the

a crackling shower of phrases filled the room:

to be packed off to school--" "do something about it at once, and what i

"now, young man, we'll have no more flippancy," old henry thompson
ordered. "you listen to me."

"you listen to grandfather!" said verona.

"yes, listen to your grandfather!" said mrs. babbitt.

"ted, you listen to mr. thompson!" said howard littlefield.

"oh, for the love o' mike, i am listening!" ted shouted. "but you look
