then you can rid your mind of any fear

shares in the gods' foreknowledge. i can give you 

clear proof of that. there came once to king laius 

an oracle— i will not say from phoebus,

that he should be struck down by his own child, 

his child and mine. but laius, as we know, 

was killed by foreign robbers at a place
