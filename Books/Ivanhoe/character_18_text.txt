these halls,
stained with the noble and pure blood of my father and my brethren--in
these very halls, to have lived the paramour of their murderer, the
slave at once and the partaker of his pleasures, was to render every
breath which i drew of vital air, a crime and a curse.”

“wretched woman!” exclaimed cedric. “and while the friends of thy
father--while each true saxon heart, as it breathed a requiem for his
soul, and those of his valiant sons, forgot not in their prayers the
murdered ulrica--while all mourned and honoured the dead, thou hast
lived to merit our hate and execration--lived to unite thyself with the
vile tyrant who murdered thy nearest and dearest--who shed the blood
of infancy, rather than a male of the noble house of torquil wolfganger
should survive--with him hast thou lived to unite thyself, and in the
hands of lawless love!”

“in lawless hands, indeed, but not in those of love!” answered the
hag; “love will sooner visit the regions of eternal doom, than

ted him, and yet you lived,” replied cedric; “wretch! was there
no poniard--no knife--no bodkin!--well was it for thee, since thou didst
prize such an existence, that the secrets of a norman castle are like
those of the grave. for had i but dreamed of the daughter of torquil
living in foul communion with the murderer of her father, the sword of a
true saxon had found thee out even in the arms of thy paramour!”

“wouldst thou indeed have done this justice to the name of torquil?”
 said ulrica, for we may now lay aside her assumed name of urfried;
“thou art then the true saxon report speaks thee! for even within these
accursed walls, where, as thou well sayest, guilt shrouds itself in
inscrutable mystery, even there has the name of cedric been sounded--and
i, wretched and degraded, have rejoiced to think that there yet

their dying groans!--look on me, cedric--are there not still left on
this foul and faded face some traces of the features of torquil?”

“ask me not of them, ulrica,” replied cedric, in a tone of grief mixed
with abhorrence; “these traces form such a resemblance as arises from
the graves of the dead, when a fiend has animated the lifeless corpse.”

“be it so,” answered ulrica; “yet wore these fiendish features the mask
of a spirit of light when they were able to set at variance the elder
front-de-boeuf and his son reginald! the darkness of hell should hide
what followed, but revenge must lift the veil, and darkly intimate what
it would raise the dead to speak aloud. long had the smouldering fire of
discord glowed between the tyrant father and his savage son--long had i
nursed, in secret, the unnatural hatred--it blazed forth in an hour of
drunken wassail, and at h

“guess it, but ask it not.--here--here i dwelt, till age, premature age,

where i was once obeyed, and compelled to bound the revenge which had
once such ample scope, to the efforts of petty malice of a discontented
menial, or the vain or unheeded curses of an impotent hag--condemned
to hear from my lonely turret the sounds of revelry in which i once
partook, or the shrieks and groans of new victims of oppression.”

“ulrica,” said cedric, “with a heart which still, i fear, regrets the
lost reward of thy crimes, as much as the deeds by which thou didst
acquire that meed, how didst thou dare to address thee to one who
wears this robe? consider, unhappy woman, what could the sainted
edward himself do for thee, were he here in bodily presence? the royal
confessor was endowed by heaven with power to cleanse the ulcers of the
body, but only god himself can cure the leprosy of the soul.”

unspeakable wretchedness? better had i turn to woden, hertha, and

haunted my waking and my sleeping hours!”

“i am no priest,” said cedric, turning with disgust from this miserable
picture of guilt, wretchedness, and despair; “i am no priest, though i
wear a priest’s garment.”

“priest or layman,” answered ulrica, “thou art the first i have seen for
twenty years, by whom god was feared or man regarded; and dost thou bid
me despair?”

“i bid thee repent,” said cedric. “seek to prayer and penance, and
mayest thou find acceptance! but i cannot, i will not, longer abide with
thee.”

“stay yet a moment!” said ulrica; “leave me not now, son of my father’s
friend, lest the demon who has governed my life should tempt me
to avenge myself of thy hard-hearted scorn--thinkest thou, if

that thy life would be a long one?--already his eye has been upon thee
like a falcon on his prey.”

“and be it so,” said cedric; “and let him tear me with beak and talons,
ere my tongue say one word which my heart doth not warrant. i will die
a saxon--true in word, open in deed--i bid thee avaunt!--touch me not,
stay me not!--the sight of front-de-boeuf himself is less odious to me
than thou, degraded and degenerate as thou art.”

“be it so,” said ulrica, no longer interrupting him; “go thy way, and
forget, in the insolence of thy superority, that the wretch before thee
is the daughter of thy father’s friend.--go thy way--if i am separated
from mankind by my sufferings--separated from those whose aid i might
most justly expect--not less will i be separated from them in my
revenge!--no man shall aid me, but the ears of all men shall tingle to
hear of the deed which i shall dare to do!--farewell!--thy scorn has

 yet to unite me to my kind--a thought
that my woes might claim the compassion of my people.”

“ulrica,” said cedric, softened by this appeal, “hast thou borne up and
endured to live through so much guilt and so much misery, and wilt thou
now yield to despair when thine eyes are opened to thy crimes, and when
repentance were thy fitter occupation?”

“cedric,” answered ulrica, “thou little knowest the human heart. to act
as i have acted, to think as i have thought, requires the maddening
love of pleasure, mingled with the keen appetite of revenge, the proud
consciousness of power; droughts too intoxicating for the human heart to
bear, and yet retain the power to prevent. their force has long passed
away--age has no pleasures, wrinkles have no influence, revenge itself
dies away in impotent curses. then comes remorse, with all its vipers,

when all other strong impulses have ceased, we become like the fiends
in hell, who may feel remorse, but never repentance.--but thy words have
awakened a new soul within me--well hast thou said, all is possible for
those who dare to die!--thou hast shown me the means of revenge, and be
assured i will embrace them. it has hitherto shared this wasted bosom
with other and with rival passions--henceforward it shall possess me
wholly, and thou thyself shalt say, that, whatever was the life of
ulrica, her death well became the daughter of the noble torquil. there
is a force without beleaguering this accursed castle--hasten to lead
them to the attack, and when thou shalt see a red flag wave from the
turret on the eastern angle of the donjon, press the normans hard--they
will then have enough to do within, and you may win the wall in spite
both of bow and mangonel.--begone, i pray thee--follow thine own fate,
and leave me to mine.”

cedric would have enquired farther into the purpose which

she thus
darkly announced, but the stern voice of front-de-boeuf was heard,
exclaiming, “where tarries this loitering priest? by the scallop-shell
of compostella, i will make a martyr of him, if he loiters here to hatch
treason among my domestics!”

“what a true prophet,” said ulrica, “is an evil conscience! but heed him
not--out and to thy people--cry your saxon onslaught, and let them sing
their war-song of rollo, if they will; vengeance shall bear a burden to
it.”

as she thus spoke, she vanished through a private door, and reginald
front-de-boeuf entered the apartment. cedric, with some difficulty,
compelled himself to make obeisance to the haughty baron, who returned
his courtesy with a slight inclination of the head.

the men, who, like most of their description, were fond of enterprise
and detested inaction, went joyfully to the scene of danger as they were
commanded, and thus the charge of ivanhoe was transferred to urfried,
or ulrica. but she, whose brain was burning with remembrance of injuries
and with hopes of vengeance, was readily induced to devolve upon rebecca
the care of her patient.

cedric, although not greatly confident in ulrica’s message, omitted not
to communicate her promise to the black knight and locksley. they were
well pleased to find they had a friend within the place, who might, in
the moment of need, be able to facilitate their entrance, and readily
agreed with the saxon that a storm, under whatever disadvantages, ought
to be attempted, as the only means of liberating the prisoners now in
the hands of the cruel front-de-boeuf.

“the royal blood of alfred is endangered,” said cedric.

an knights, who were well provided with arms both defensive
and offensive; and who, to match the zeal and high spirit of the
besiegers, had all the confidence which arises from perfect discipline
and the habitual use of weapons.

the knight employed the interval in causing to be constructed a sort of
floating bridge, or long raft, by means of which he hoped to cross the
moat in despite of the resistance of the enemy. this was a work of some
time, which the leaders the less regretted, as it gave ulrica leisure to
execute her plan of diversion in their favour, whatever that might be.

when the raft was completed, the black knight addressed the
besiegers:--“it avails not waiting here longer, my friends; the sun is
descending to the west--and i have that upon my hands which will not
permit me to tarry with you another day. besides, it will be a marvel if

“shame on ye all!” cried de bracy to the soldiers around him; “do ye
call yourselves cross-bowmen, and let these two dogs keep their station
under the walls of the castle?--heave over the coping stones from the
battlements, an better may not be--get pick-axe and levers, and down
with that huge pinnacle!” pointing to a heavy piece of stone carved-work
that projected from the parapet.

at this moment the besiegers caught sight of the red flag upon the angle
of the tower which ulrica had described to cedric. the stout yeoman
locksley was the first who was aware of it, as he was hasting to the
outwork, impatient to see the progress of the assault.

“saint george!” he cried, “merry saint george for england!--to the
charge, bold yeomen!--why leave ye the good knight and noble cedric to
storm the pass alone?--make in, mad priest, show thou canst fight for
thy rosary,--make in, brave yeomen!--the castle is ours, we have friends

having thus spoken, he galloped off with his followers.

those of the castle who had not gotten to horse, still continued
to fight desperately with the besiegers, after the departure of the
templar, but rather in despair of quarter than that they entertained any
hope of escape. the fire was spreading rapidly through all parts of the
castle, when ulrica, who had first kindled it, appeared on a turret, in
the guise of one of the ancient furies, yelling forth a war-song, such
as was of yore raised on the field of battle by the scalds of the
yet heathen saxons. her long dishevelled grey hair flew back from her
uncovered head; the inebriating delight of gratified vengeance contended
in her eyes with the fire of insanity; and she brandished the distaff
which she held in her hand, as if she had been one of the fatal sisters,

the adjacent country. tower after tower crashed down, with blazing roof

vanquished, of whom very few remained, scattered and escaped into the
neighbouring wood. the victors, assembling in large bands, gazed with
wonder, not unmixed with fear, upon the flames, in which their own ranks
and arms glanced dusky red. the maniac figure of the saxon ulrica was
for a long time visible on the lofty stand she had chosen, tossing
her arms abroad with wild exultation, as if she reined empress of the
conflagration which she had raised. at length, with a terrific crash,
the whole turret gave way, and she perished in the flames which had
consumed her tyrant. an awful pause of horror silenced each murmur of
the armed spectators, who, for the space of several minutes, stirred not
a finger, save to sign the cross. the voice of locksley was then heard,
