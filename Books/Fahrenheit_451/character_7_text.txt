d with the silence 

and the sub-audible trembling around and about and in the women who were burning with 

tension. any moment they might hiss a long sputtering hiss and explode. 

montag moved his lips. 

"let's talk." 

the women jerked and stared. 

"how're your children, mrs. phelps?" he asked. 

"you know i haven't any! no one in his right mind, the good lord knows; would have 

children!" said mrs. phelps, not quite sure why she was angry with this man. 

"i wouldn't say that," said mrs. bowles. "i've had two children by caesarian section. no use 

going through all that agony for a baby. the world must reproduce, you know, the race must go 



on. besides, they sometimes look just like you, and that's nice. two caesarians tamed the trick, 

yes, sir. oh, my doctor said, caesarians aren't necessary; you've got the, hips for it, everything's 

normal, but i insisted." 

"caesarians or not, children are ruinous; you're out of your mind," said mrs. phelps. 

"i plunk the children in scho

ol nine days out of ten. i put up with them when they come home 

three days a month; it's not bad at all. you heave them into the 'parlour' and turn the switch. it's 

like washing clothes; stuff laundry in and slam the lid." mrs. bowles tittered. "they'd just as 

soon kick as kiss me. thank god, i can kick back! " 

the women showed their tongues, laughing. 

mildred sat a moment and then, seeing that montag was still in the doorway, clapped her hands. 

"let's talk politics, to please guy!" 

"sounds fine," said mrs. bowles. "i voted last election, same as everyone, and i laid it on the line 

for president noble. i think he's one of the nicest-looking men who ever became president." 

"oh, but the man they ran against him!"

tag felt himself turning in a great circling roar and buzz and hum. 

"montag, hold on, don't..." 

"did you hear them, did you hear these monsters talking about monsters? oh god, the way they 

jabber about people and their own children and themselves and the way they talk about their 

husbands and the way they talk about war, dammit, i stand here and i can't believe it!" 

"i didn't say a single word about any war, i'll have you know," said mrs, phelps. 

"as for poetry, i hate it," said mrs. bowles. 

"have you ever read any?" 

"montag," faber's voice scraped away at him. "you'll ruin everything. shut up, you fool!" 

"all three women were on their feet. 

"sit down!" 

they sat. 



"i'm going home," quavered mrs. bowles. 

"montag, montag, please, in the name of god, what are you up to?" pleaded faber. 

"why don't you just read us one of those poems from your little book," mrs. phelps nodded. "i 

think that'd he very interesting." 

"that's not right," wailed mrs. bowles. "we can't d

he looked at the opened page. 

a fly stirred its wings softly in his ear. "read." 

"what's the title, dear?" 

"dover beach." his mouth was numb. 

"now read in a nice clear voice and go slow." 

the room was blazing hot, he was all fire, he was all coldness; they sat in the middle of an empty 

desert with three chairs and him standing, swaying, and him waiting for mrs. phelps to stop 

straightening her dress hem and mrs. bowles to take her fingers away from her hair. then he 

began to read in a low, stumbling voice that grew firmer as he progressed from line to line, and 

his voice went out across the desert, into the whiteness, and around the three sitting women there 

in the great hot emptiness: 

"the sea of faith 

was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore 

lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled. 

but now i only hear 

its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar, 

retreating, to the breath

where ignorant armies clash by night.'" 

mrs. phelps was crying. 

the others in the middle of the desert watched her crying grow very loud as her face squeezed 

itself out of shape. they sat, not touching her, bewildered by her display. she sobbed 

uncontrollably. montag himself was stunned and shaken. 

"sh, sh," said mildred. "you're all right, clara, now, clara, snap out of it! clara, what's wrong?" 

"i-i,", sobbed mrs. phelps, "don't know, don't know, i just don't know, oh oh..." 

mrs. bowles stood up and glared at montag. "you see? i knew it, that's what i wanted to prove! i 

knew it would happen! i've always said, poetry and tears, poetry and suicide and crying and 

awful feelings, poetry and sickness; all that mush! now i've had it proved to me. you're nasty, 

mr. montag, you're nasty! " 

faber said, "now..." 

montag felt himself turn and walk to the wall-slot and drop the book in through the brass notch 

to the waiting flames. 

"silly words, silly words, silly awful hurti

ng words," said mrs. bowles. "why do people want to 

hurt people? not enough hurt in the world, you've got to tease people with stuff like that ! " 

"clara, now, clara," begged mildred, pulling her arm. "come on, let's be cheery, you turn the 

"family' on, now. go ahead. let's laugh and be happy, now, stop crying, we'll have a party!" 

"no," said mrs. bowles. "i'm trotting right straight home. you want to visit my house and 

"family,' well and good. but i won't come in this fireman's crazy house again in my lifetime! " 

"go home." montag fixed his eyes upon her, quietly. "go home and think of your first husband 

divorced and your second husband killed in a jet and your third husband blowing his brains out, 

go home and think of the dozen abortions you've had, go home and think of that and your damn 

caesarian sections, too, and your children w
