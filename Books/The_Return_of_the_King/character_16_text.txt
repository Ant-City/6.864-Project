â€˜it is,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜one of the twain. the other is with thÃ©oden of rohan and may come hereafter. halflings they are, as you see, yet this is not he of whom the omens spoke.â€™
â€˜yet a halfling still,â€™ said denethor grimly, â€˜and little love do i bear the name, since those accursed words came to trouble our counsels and drew away my son on the wild errand to his death. my boromir! now we have need of you. faramir should have gone in his stead.â€™
â€˜he would have gone,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜be not unjust in your grief! boromir claimed the errand and would not suffer any other to have it. he was a masterful man, and one to take what he desired. i journeyed far with him and learned much of his mood. but you speak of his death. you have had news of that ere we came?â€™
â€˜i have received this,â€™ said denethor, and laying down his rod he lifted from his lap the thing that he had been gazing at. in each hand

not lead the company from moria, and that there was one among you of high honour who was coming to minas tirith; and that he had a famous sword. men think much about the stories of old days in gondor; and denethor has given long thought to the rhyme and to the words isildurâ€™s bane, since boromir went away.
â€˜he is not as other men of this time, pippin, and whatever be his descent from father to son, by some chance the blood of westernesse runs nearly true in him; as it does in his other son, faramir, and yet did not in boromir whom he loved best. he has long sight. he can perceive, if he bends his will thither, much of what is passing in the minds of men, even of those that dwell far off. it is difficult to deceive him, and dangerous to try.
â€˜remember that! for you are now sworn to his service. i do not know what put it into your head, or your heart, to do that. but it was well done. i did not hinder it, for generous deed should not be checked by cold counsel. it touched his heart, as we

he fell silent and sighed. â€˜well, no need to brood on what tomorrow may bring. for one thing, tomorrow will be certain to bring worse than today, for many days to come. and there is nothing more that i can do to help it. the board is set, and the pieces are moving. one piece that i greatly desire to find is faramir, now the heir of denethor. i do not think that he is in the city; but i have had no time to gather news. i must go. pippin. i must go to this lordsâ€™ council and learn what i can. but the enemy has the move, and he is about to open his full game. and pawns are likely to see as much of it as any, peregrin son of paladin, soldier of gondor. sharpen your blade!â€™
gandalf went to the door, and there he turned. â€˜i am in haste pippin,â€™ he said. â€˜do me a favour when you go out. even before you

ed,â€™ answered beregond. â€˜but i do not know the counsel of the lord and his captains. they have many ways of gathering news. and the lord denethor is unlike other men: he sees far. some say that as he sits alone in his high chamber in the tower at night, and bends his thought this way and that, he can read somewhat of the future; and that he will at times search even the mind of the enemy, wrestling with him. and so it is that he is old, worn before his time. but however that may be, my lord faramir is abroad, beyond the river on some perilous errand, and he may have sent tidings.
â€˜but if you would know what i think set the beacons ablaze, it was the news that came yestereve out of lebennin. there is a great fleet drawing near to the mouths of anduin, manned by the corsairs of umbar in the south. they have long ceased to fear the might of gondor, and they have allied them with the enemy, and now make a heavy stroke in his cause. for this attack will draw off much of the help that we look

wish it was over for good or ill.â€™ said pippin. â€˜i am no warrior at all and dislike any thought of battle; but waiting on the edge of one that i canâ€™t escape is worst of all. what a long day it seems already! i should be happier, if we were not obliged to stand and watch, making no move, striking nowhere first. no stroke would have been struck in rohan, i think, but for gandalf.â€™
â€˜ah, there you lay your finger on the sore that many feel!â€™ said beregond. â€˜but things may change when faramir returns. he is bold, more bold than many deem; for in these days men are slow to believe that a captain can be wise and learned in the scrolls of lore and song, as he is, and yet a man of hardihood and swift judgement in the field. but such is faramir. less reckless and eager than boromir, but not less resolute. yet what indeed can he do? we cannot assault the mountains of - of yonder realm. our reach is shortened, and we cannot strike till some foe comes within it. then our hand must be heavy!

n the bench and tried to peer out of a window, but it was like looking into a pool of ink. he got down and closed the shutter and went to bed. for a while he lay and listened for sounds of gandalfâ€™s return, and then he fell into an uneasy sleep.
in the night he was wakened by a light, and he saw that gandalf had come and was pacing to and fro in the room beyond the curtain of the alcove. there were candles on the table and rolls of parchment. he heard the wizard sigh, and mutter: â€˜when will faramir return?â€™
â€˜hullo!â€™ said pippin, poking his head round the curtain. â€˜i thought you had forgotten all about me. i am glad to see you back. it has been a long day.â€™
â€˜but the night will be too short,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜i have come back here, for i must have a little peace, alone. you should sleep, in a bed while you still may. at the sunrise i shall take you to the lord denethor again. no, when the summons comes, not at sunrise. the darkness has begun. there will be no dawn.â€™

 think i should feel the honour more deeply. but what is the good of such honour? indeed what is the good even of food and drink under this creeping shadow? what does it mean? the very air seems thick and brown! do you often have such glooms when the wind is in the east?â€™
â€˜nay,â€™ said beregond, â€˜this is no weather of the world. this is some device of his malice; some broil of fume from the mountain of fire that he sends to darken hearts and counsel. and so it doth indeed. i wish the lord faramir would return. he would not be dismayed. but now, who knows if he will ever come back across the river out of the darkness?â€™
â€˜yes,â€™ said pippin, â€˜gandalf, too, is anxious. he was disappointed. i think, not to find faramir here. and where has he got to himself? he left the lordâ€™s council before the noon-meal, and in no good mood either, i thought. perhaps he has some foreboding of bad news.â€™
suddenly as they talked they were stricken dumb, frozen as it were to listening stones. pippin

 cowered down with his hands pressed to his ears; but beregond, who had been looking out from the battlement as he spoke of faramir, remained there, stiffened, staring out with starting eyes. pippin knew the shuddering cry that he had heard: it was the same that he had heard long ago in the marish of the shire, but now it was grown in power and hatred, piercing the heart with a poisonous despair.
at last beregond spoke with an effort. â€˜they have come!â€™ he said. â€˜take courage and look! there are fell things below.â€™
reluctantly pippin climbed on to the seat and looked out over the wall. the pelennor lay dim beneath hi

g for something, surely? see how they wheel and swoop, always down to that point over there! and can you see something moving on the ground? dark little things. yes, men on horses: four or five. ah! i cannot stand it! gandalf! gandalf save us!â€™
another long screech rose and fell, and he threw himself back again from the wall, panting like a hunted animal. faint and seemingly remote through that shuddering cry he heard winding up from below the sound of a trumpet ending on a long high note.
â€˜faramir! the lord faramir! it is his call!â€™ cried beregond. â€˜brave heart! but how can he win to the gate, if these foul hell-hawks have other weapons than fear? but look! they hold on. they will make the gate. no! the horses are running mad. look! the men are thrown; they are running on foot. no, one is still up, but he rides back to the others. that will be the captain: he can master both beasts and men. ah! there one of the foul things is stooping on him. help! help! will no one go out to him? fa

 now hurried out to them from the city; and soon they all passed from sight under the outer walls, and he knew that they were entering the gate. guessing that they would come at once to the tower and the steward, he hurried to the entrance of the citadel. there he was joined by many others who had watched the race and the rescue from the high walls.
it was not long before a clamour was heard in the streets leading up from the outer circles, and there was much cheering and crying of the names of faramir and mithrandir. presently pippin saw torches, and followed by a press of people two horsemen riding slowly: one was in white but shining no longer, pale in the twilight as if his fire was spent or veiled; the other was dark and his head was bowed. they dismounted, and as grooms took shadowfax and the other horse, they walked forward to the sentinel at the gate: gandalf steadily, his grey cloak flung back, and a fire still smouldering in his eyes; the other, clad all in green, slowly, swaying a

little as a weary or a wounded man.
pippin pressed forward as they passed under the lamp beneath the gate-arch, and when he saw the pale face of faramir he caught his breath. it was the face of one who has been assailed by a great fear or anguish, but has mastered it and now is quiet. proud and grave he stood for a moment as he spoke to the guard, and pippin gazing at him saw how closely he resembled his brother boromir - whom pippin had liked from the first, admiring the great manâ€™s lordly but kindly manner. yet suddenly for faramir his heart was strangely moved with a feeling that he had not known before. here was one with an air of high no

bility such as aragorn at times revealed, less high perhaps, yet also less incalculable and remote: one of the kings of men born into a later time, but touched with the wisdom and sadness of the elder race. he knew now why beregond spoke his name with love. he was a captain that men would follow, that he would follow, even under the shadow of the black wings.
â€˜faramir!â€™ he cried aloud with the others. â€˜faramir!â€™ and faramir catching his strange voice among the clamour of the men of the city, turned and looked down at him and was amazed.
â€˜whence come you?â€™ he said. â€˜a halfling, and in the livery of the tower! whenceâ€¦?â€™
but with that gandalf stepped to his side and spoke. â€˜he came with me from the land of the halflings,â€™ he said. â€˜he came with me. but let us not tarry here. there is much to say and to do, and you are weary. he shall come with us. indeed he must, for if he does not forget his new duti

so at length they came to the private chamber of the lord of the city. there deep seats were set about a brazier of charcoal; and wine was brought; and there pippin, hardly noticed, stood behind the chair of denethor and felt his weariness little, so eagerly did he listen to all that was said.
when faramir had taken white bread and drunk a draught of wine, he sat upon a low chair at his fatherâ€™s left hand. removed a little upon the other side sat gandalf in a chair of carven wood; and he seemed at first to be asleep. for at the beginning faramir spoke only of the errand upon which he had been sent out ten days before, and he brought tidings of ithilien and of movements of the enemy and his allies; and he told of the fight on the road when the men of harad and their great beast were overthrown:

a captain reporting to his master such matters as had often been heard before, small things of border-war that now seemed useless and petty, shorn of their renown.
then suddenly faramir looked at pippin. â€˜but now we come to strange matters,â€™ he said. â€˜for this is not the first halfling that i have seen walking out of northern legends into the southlands.â€™
at that gandalf sat up and gripped the arms of his chair; but he said nothing, and with a look stopped the exclamation on pippinâ€™s lips. denethor looked at their faces and nodded his head, as though in sign that he had read much there before it was spoken. slowly, while the others sat silent and still, faramir told

his glance strayed to pippin, as if to refresh his memory of others that he had seen.
as his story was unfolded of his meeting with frodo and his servant and of the events at henneth annÃ»n, pippin became aware that gandalfâ€™s hands were trembling as they clutched the carven wood. white they seemed now and very old, and as he looked at them, suddenly with a thrill of fear pippin knew that gandalf, gandalf himself, was troubled, even afraid. the air of the room was close and still. at last when faramir spoke of his parting with the travellers, and of their resolve to go to cirith ungol, his voice fell, and he shook his head and sighed. then gandalf sprang up.
â€˜cirith ungol? morgul vale?â€™ he said. â€˜the time, faramir, the time? when did you part with them? when would they reach that accursed valley?â€™
â€˜i parted with them in the morning two days ago,â€™ said faramir. â€˜it is fifteen leagues thence to the vale of the morgulduin, if they went straight south; and then they would be still

 come there yet. indeed i see what you fear. but the darkness is not due to their venture. it began yestereve, and all ithilien was under shadow last night. it is clear to me that the enemy has long planned an assault on us, and its hour had already been determined before ever the travellers left my keeping.â€™
gandalf paced the floor. â€˜the morning of two days ago, nigh on three days of journey! how far is the place where you parted?â€™
â€˜some twenty-five leagues as a bird flies,â€™ answered faramir. â€˜but i could not come more swiftly. yestereve i lay at cair andros, the long isle in the river northward which we hold in defence; and horses are kept on the hither bank. as the dark drew on i knew that haste was needed, so i rode thence with three others that could also be horsed. the rest of my company i sent south to strengthen the garrison at the fords of osgiliath. i hope that i have not done ill?â€™ he looked at his father.
â€˜ill?â€™ cried denethor, and his eyes flashed suddenly. â€˜w

â€˜my son, your father is old but not yet dotard. i can see and hear, as was my wont; and little of what you have half said or left unsaid is now hidden from me. i know the answer to many riddles. alas, alas for boromir!â€™
â€˜if what i have done displeases you, my father,â€™ said faramir quietly, â€˜i wish i had known your counsel before the burden of so weighty a judgement was thrust on me.â€™
â€˜would that have availed to change your judgement?â€™ said denethor. â€˜you would still have done just so, i deem. i know you well. ever your desire is to appear lordly and generous as a king of old, gracious, gentle. that may well befit one of high race, if he sits in power and peace. but in desperate hours gentleness may be repaid with death.â€™
â€˜so be it,â€™ said faramir.

â€˜do you wish then,â€™ said faramir, â€˜that our places had been exchanged?â€™
â€˜yes, i wish that indeed,â€™ said denethor. â€˜for boromir was loyal to me and no wizardâ€™s pupil. he would have remembered his fatherâ€™s need, and would not have squandered what fortune gave. he would have brought me a mighty gift.â€™
for a moment faramirâ€™s restraint gave way. â€˜i would ask you, my father, to remember why it was that i, not he, was in ithilien. on one occasion at least your counsel has prevailed, not long ago. it was the lord o

eye, flickering as they fenced. pippin trembled fearing some dreadful stroke. but suddenly denethor relaxed and grew cold again. he shrugged his shoulders.
â€˜if i had! if you had!â€™ he said. â€˜such words and ifs are vain. it has gone into the shadow, and only time will show what doom awaits it and us. the time will not be long. in what is left, let all who fight the enemy in their fashion be at one, and keep hope while they may, and after hope still the hardihood to die free.â€™ he turned to faramir. â€˜what think you of the garrison at osgiliath?â€™
â€˜it is not strong,â€™ said faramir. â€˜i have sent the company of ithilien to strengthen it, as i have said.â€™
â€˜not enough, i deem,â€™ said denethor. â€˜it is there that the first blow will fall. they will have need of some stout captain there.â€™
â€˜there and elsewhere in many places,â€™ said faramir, and sighed. â€˜alas for my brother, whom i too loved!â€™ he rose. â€˜may i have your leave, father?â€™ and then he swayed and leaned upon

his fatherâ€™s chair.
â€˜you are weary, i see,â€™ said denethor. â€˜you have ridden fast and far, and under shadows of evil in the air, i am told.â€™
â€˜let us not speak of that!â€™ said faramir.
â€˜then we will not,â€™ said denethor. â€˜go now and rest as you may. tomorrowâ€™s need will be sterner.â€™
all now took leave of the lord of the city and went to rest while they still could. outside there was a starless blackness as gandalf with pippin beside him bearing a small torch, made his way to their lodging. they did not speak until they were behind closed doors. then at last pippin took gandalfâ€™s hand.
â€˜tell me,â€™ he said, â€˜is there any hope? for frodo, i mean; or at least mos
 
 ___________________________
 
tly for frodo.â€™
gandalf put his hand on pippinâ€™s head. â€˜there never was much hope,â€™ he answered. â€˜just a foolâ€™s hope, as i have been told. and when i heard of cirith ungol---â€˜ he broke off and strode to the window as if his eyes could pierce the night in the east. â€˜cirith ungol!â€™ he muttered. â€˜why that way, i wonder?â€™ he turned. â€˜just now, pippin, my heart almost failed me, hearing that name. and yet in truth i believe that the news that faramir brings has some hope in it. for it seems clear that our enemy has opened his war at last and made the first move while frodo was still free. so now for many days he will have his eye turned this way and that, away from his own land. and yet, pippin, i feel from afar his haste and fear. he has begun sooner than he would. something has happened to stir him.â€™
gandalf stood for a moment in thought. â€˜maybe,â€™ he muttered. â€˜maybe even your foolishness helped, my lad. let me see: some five days

s at need. that may be it. he may have used the stone and shown himself to the enemy, challenging him, for this very purpose. i wonder. well, we shall not know the answer till the riders of rohan come, if they do not come too late. there are evil days ahead. to sleep while we may!â€™
â€˜but,â€™ said pippin.
â€˜but what?â€™ said gandalf. â€˜only one but will i allow tonight.â€™
â€˜gollum,â€™ said pippin. â€˜how on earth could they be going about with him, even following him? and i could see that faramir did not like the place he was taking them to any more than you do. what is wrong?â€™
â€˜i cannot answer that now,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜yet my heart guessed that frodo and gollum would meet before the end. for good, or for evil. but of cirith ungol i will not speak tonight. treachery, treachery i fear; treachery of that miserable creature. but so it must be. let us remember that a traitor may betray himself and do good that he does not intend. it can be so, sometimes. good night! â€˜
the next day
 
 ___________________________
 
 came with a morning like a brown dusk, and the hearts of men, lifted for a while by the return of faramir, sank low again. the winged shadows were not seen again that day, yet ever and anon, high above the city, a faint cry would come, and many who heard it would stand stricken with a passing dread, while the less stout-hearted quailed and wept.
and now faramir was gone again. â€˜they give him no rest,â€™ some murmured. â€˜the lord drives his son too hard, and now he must do the duty of two, for himself and for the one that will not return.â€™ and ever men looked northward, asking: â€˜where are the riders of rohan?â€™
in truth faramir did not go by his own choosing. but the lord of the city was master of his council, and he was in no mood that day to bow to others. early in the morning the council had been summoned. there all the captains judged that

˜yet,â€™ said denethor, â€˜we should not lightly abandon the outer defences, the rammas made with so great a labour. and the enemy must pay dearly for the crossing of the river. that he cannot do, in force to assail the city, either north of cair andros because of the marshes, or southwards towards lebennin because of the breadth of the river, that needs many boats. it is at osgiliath that he will put his weight, as before when boromir denied him the passage.â€™
â€˜that was but a trial,â€™ said faramir. â€˜today we may make the enemy pay ten times our loss at the passage and yet rue the exchange. for he can afford to lose a host better than we to lose a company. and the retreat of those that we put out far afield will be perilous, if he wins across in force.â€™
â€˜and what of cair andros?â€™ said the prince. â€˜that, too, must be held, if osgiliath is defended. let us not forget the danger on our left. the rohirrim may come, and they may not. but faramir has told us of great strength drawing

ever to the black gate. more than one host may issue from it, and strike for more than one passage.â€™
â€˜much must be risked in war,â€™ said denethor. â€˜cair andros is manned and no more can be sent so far. but i will not yield the river and the pelennor unfought - not if there is a captain here who has still the courage to do his lordâ€™s will.â€™
then all were silent, but at length faramir said: â€˜i do not oppose your will, sire. since you are robbed of boromir, i will go and do what i can in his stead - if you command it.â€™
â€˜i do so,â€™ said denethor.
â€˜then farewell!â€™ said faramir. â€˜but if i should return, think better of me!â€™
â€˜that depends on the manner of your return,â€™ said denethor.
gandalf it was that last spoke to faramir ere he rode east. â€˜do not throw your live away rashly or in bitterness,â€™ he said. â€˜you will be needed here, for other things than wa

r. your father loves you, faramir, and will remember it ere the end. farewell!â€™
so now the lord faramir had gone forth again, and had taken with him such strength of men as were willing to go or could be spared. on the walls some gazed through the gloom towards the ruined city, and they wondered what chanced there, for nothing could be seen. and others, as ever, looked north and counted the leagues to thÃ©oden in rohan. â€˜will he come? will he remember our old alliance?â€™ they said.
â€˜yes, he will come,â€™ said gandalf, â€˜even if he comes too late. but think! at best the red arrow cannot have

 man rode in haste from the fords, saying that a host had issued from minas morgul and was already drawing nigh to osgiliath; and it had been joined by regiments from the south, haradrim, cruel and tall. â€˜and we have learned â€˜ said the messenger, â€˜that the black captain leads them once again, and the fear of him has passed before him over the river.â€™
with those ill-boding words the third day closed since pippin came to minas tirith. few went to rest, for small hope had any now that even faramir could hold the fords for long.
the next day, though the darkness had reached its full and grew no deeper, it weighed heavier on menâ€™s hearts, and a great dread was on them. ill news came soon again. the passage of anduin was won by the enemy. faramir was retreating to the wall of the pelennor, rallying his men to the causeway forts; but he was ten times outnumbered.
â€˜if he wins back at all across the pelennor, his enemies will be on his heels,â€™ said the messenger. â€˜they have paid dear f

od upon the wall and gazed eastward.
the bells of day had scarcely rung out again, a mockery in the unlightened dark, when far away he saw fires spring up, across in the dim spaces where the walls of the pelennor stood. the watchmen cried aloud, and all men in the city stood to arms. now ever and anon there was a red flash, and slowly through the heavy air dull rumbles could be heard.
â€˜they have taken the wall!â€™ men cried. â€˜they are blasting breaches in it. they are coming!â€™
â€˜where is faramir?â€™ cried beregond in dismay. â€˜say not that he has fallen!â€™
it was gandalf that brought the first tidings. with a handful of horsemen he came in the middle morning, riding as escort to a line of wains. they were filled with wounded men, all that could be saved from the wreck of the causeway forts. at once he went to denethor. the lord of the city sat now in a high chamber above the hall of the white tower with pippin at his side; and through the dim windows, north and south and east, he ben

t his dark eyes, as if to pierce the shadows of doom that ringed him round. most to the north he looked, and would pause at whiles to listen as if by some ancient art his ears might hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains far away.
â€˜is faramir come?â€™ he asked.
â€˜no,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜but he still lived when i left him. yet he is resolved to stay with the rearguard, lest the retreat over the pelennor become a rout. he may, perhaps, hold his men together long enough, but i doubt it. he is pitted against a foe too great. for one has come that i feared.â€™
â€˜not - the dark lord?â€™ cried pippin, forgetting his place in his terror.
denethor laughed bitterly. â€˜nay, not yet, master peregrin! he will not come save only to triumph ove

through the breaches! and they carry torches, it seems. where are our own folk?â€™
it drew now to evening by the hour, and the light was so dim that even far-sighted men upon the citadel could discern little clearly out upon the fields, save only the burnings that ever multiplied, and the lines of fire that grew in length and speed. at last, less than a mile from the city, a more ordered mass of men came into view, marching not running, still holding together.
the watchers held their breath. â€˜faramir must be there,â€™ they said. â€˜he can govern man and beast. he will make it yet.â€™
now the main retreat was scarcely two furlongs distant. out of the gloom behind a small company of horsemen galloped, all that was left of the rearguard. once again they turned at bay, facing the oncoming lines of fire. then suddenly there was a tumult of fierce cries. horsemen of the enemy swept up. the lines of fire became flowing torrents, file upon file of orcs bearing flames, and wild southron men with red

l, and denethor at last released the sortie. drawn up within the shadow of the gate and under the looming walls outside they had waited for his signal: all the mounted men that were left in the city. now they sprang forward, formed, quickened to a gallop, and charged with a great shout. and from the walls an answering shout went up; for foremost on the field rode the swan-knights of dol amroth with their prince and his blue banner at their head.
â€˜amroth for gondor!â€™ they cried. â€˜amroth to faramir!â€™
like thunder they broke upon the enemy on either flank of the retreat; but one rider outran them all, swift as the wind in the grass: shadowfax bore him, shining, unveiled once more, a light starting from his upraised hand.
the nazgÃ»l screeched and swept away, for their captain was not yet come to challenge the white fire of his foe. the hosts of morgul intent on their prey, taken at unawares in wild career, broke, scattering like sparks in a gale. the out-companies with a great cheer turn

 to go far. though the enemy was checked, and for the moment driven back, great forces were flowing in from the east. again the trumpet rang, sounding the retreat. the cavalry of gondor halted. behind their screen the out-companies re-formed. now steadily they came marching back. they reached the gate of the city and entered, stepping proudly: and proudly the people of the city looked on them and cried their praise, and yet they were troubled in heart. for the companies were grievously reduced. faramir had lost a third of his men. and where was he?
last of all he came. his men passed in. the mounted knights returned, and at their rear the banner of dol amroth, and the prince. and in his arms before him on his horse he bore the body of his kinsman, faramir son of denethor, found upon the stricken field.
â€˜faramir! faramir!â€™ men cried, weeping in the streets. but he did not answer, and they bore him away up the winding road to the citadel and his father. even as the nazgÃ»l had swerved aside

 from the onset of the white rider, there came flying a deadly dart, and faramir, as he held at bay a mounted champion of harad, had fallen to the earth. only the charge of dol amroth had saved him from the red southland swords that would have hewed him as he lay.
the prince imrahil brought faramir to the white tower, and he said: your son has returned, lord, after great deeds, and he told all that he had seen. but denethor rose and looked on the face of his son and was silent. then he bade them make a bed in the chamber and lay faramir upon it and depart. but he himself went up alone into the secret room under the summit of the tower; and many who looked up thither at that time saw a pale light that gleamed and flickered from the narrow windows for a while, and then flashed and went out.

 and when denethor descended again he went to faramir and sat beside him without speaking, but the face of the lord was grey, more deathlike than his sonâ€™s.
so now at last the city was besieged, enclosed in a ring of foes. the rammas was broken, and all the pelennor abandoned to the enemy. the last word to come from outside the walls was brought by men flying down the northward road ere the gate was shut. they were the remnant of the guard that was kept at that point where the way from anÃ³rien and rohan ran into the townlands: ingold led them,

ed menâ€™s flesh. out of sight and shot they flew, and yet were ever present, and their deadly voices rent the air. more unbearable they became, not less, at each new cry. at length even the stout-hearted would fling themselves to the ground as the hidden menace passed over them, or they would stand, letting their weapons fall from nerveless hands while into their minds a blackness came, and they thought no more of war, but only of hiding and of crawling, and of death.
during all this black day faramir lay upon his bed in the chamber of the white tower, wandering in a desperate fever; dying someone said, and soon â€˜dyingâ€™ all men were saying upon the walls and in the streets. and by him his father sat, and said nothing, but watched, and gave no longer any heed to the defence.
no hours so dark had pippin known, not even in the clutches of the uruk-hai. it was his duty to wait upon the lord, and wait he did, forgotten it seemed, standing by the door of the unlit chamber, mastering his own fe

ere were too few now left there to do them great damage, though the light of the fires showed up many a mark for archers of such skill as gondor once had boasted. then perceiving that the valour of the city was already beaten down, the hidden captain put forth his strength. slowly the great siege-towers built in osgiliath rolled forward through the dark.
messengers came again to the chamber in the white tower, and pippin let them enter, for they were urgent. denethor turned his head slowly from faramirâ€™s face, and looked at them silently.
â€˜the first circle of the city is burning, lord,â€™ they said. â€˜what are your commands? you are still the lord and steward. not all will follow mithrandir. men are flying from the walls and leaving them unmanned.â€™
â€˜why? why do the fools fly?â€™ said denethor. â€˜better to burn sooner than late, for burn we must. go back to your bonfire! and i? i will go now to my pyre. to my pyre! no tomb for denethor and faramir. no tomb! no long slow sleep of deat

h embalmed. we will burn like heathen kings before ever a ship sailed hither from the west. the west has failed. go back and burn!â€™
the messengers without bow or answer turned and fled.
now denethor stood up and released the fevered hand of faramir that he had held. â€˜he is burning, already burning,â€™ he said sadly. â€˜the house of his spirit crumbles.â€™ then stepping softly towards pippin he looked down at him.
â€˜farewell!â€™ he said. â€˜farewell, peregrin son of paladin! your service has been short, and now it is drawing to an end. i release you from the little that remains. go now, and die in what way seems best to you. and with whom you will, even that friend whose folly brought you to this death. send for my servants and then go.
 
 ___________________________
 
˜i will take your leave, sir,â€™ he said; â€˜for i want to see gandalf very much indeed. but he is no fool; and i will not think of dying until he despairs of life. but from my word and your service i do not wish to be released while you live. and if they come at last to the citadel, i hope to be here and stand beside you and earn perhaps the arms that you have given me.â€™
â€˜do as you will, master halfling,â€™ said denethor. â€˜but my life is broken. send for my servants!â€™ he turned back to faramir.
pippin left him and called for the servants, and they came: six men of the household, strong and fair; yet they trembled at the summons. but in a quiet voice denethor bade them lay warm coverlets on faramirâ€™s bed and take it up. and they did so, and lifting up the bed they bore it from the chamber. slowly they paced to trouble the fevered man as little as might be, and denethor, now bending on a staff, followed them; and last came pippin.
out from the white tower they walked, as if to a fune

 dead; and they entered into the house of the stewards and set down their burden.
there pippin, staring uneasily about him, saw that he was in a wide vaulted chamber, draped as it were with the great shadows that the little lantern threw upon its shrouded walls. and dimly to be seen were many rows of tables, carved of marble; and upon each table lay a sleeping form, hands folded, head pillowed upon stone. but one table near at hand stood broad and bare. upon it at a sign from denethor they laid faramir and his father side by side, and covered them with one covering, and stood then with bowed heads as mourners beside a bed of death. then denethor spoke in a low voice.
â€˜here we will wait,â€™ he said. â€˜but send not for the embalmers. bring us wood quick to burn, and lay it all about us, and beneath; and pour oil upon it. and when i bid you thrust in a torch. do this and speak no more to me. farewell!â€™
â€˜by your leave, lord!â€™ said pippin and turned and fled in terror from the deathly hou

at the door he turned to one of the servants who had remained on guard there. â€˜your master is not himself,â€™ he said. â€˜go slow! bring no fire to this place while faramir lives! do nothing until gandalf comes!â€™
â€˜who is the master of minas tirith?â€™ the man answered. â€˜the lord denethor or the grey wanderer?â€™
â€˜the grey wanderer or no one, it would seem,â€™ said pippin, and he sped back and up the winding way as swiftly as his feet would carry him, past the astonished porter, out through the door, and on, till he came near the gate of the citadel. the sentinel hailed him as he went by, and he recognized the voice of beregond.
â€˜whither do you run, maste

â€˜to find mithrandir,â€™ pippin answered.
â€˜the lordâ€™s errands are urgent and should not be hindered by me,â€™ said beregond; â€˜but tell me quickly, if you may: what goes forward? whither has my lord gone? i have just come on duty, but i heard that he passed towards the closed door, and men were bearing faramir before him.â€™
â€˜yes,â€™ said pippin, â€˜to the silent street.â€™
beregond bowed his head to hide his tears. â€˜they said that he was dying,â€™ he sighed, â€˜and now he is dead.â€™
â€˜no,â€™ said pippin, â€˜not yet. and even now his death might be prevented, i think. but the lord of the city, beregond, has fallen before his city is taken. he is fey and dangerous.â€™ quickly he told of denethorâ€™s strange words and deeds. â€˜i must find gandalf at once.â€™
â€˜then you must go down to the battl

â€˜i know. the lord has given me leave. but, beregond, if you can, do something to stop any dreadful thing happening.â€™
â€˜the lord does not permit those who wear the black and silver to leave their post for any cause, save at his own command.â€™
â€˜well, you must choose between orders and the life of faramir,â€™ said pippin. â€˜and as for orders, i think you have a madman to deal with, not a lord. i must run. i will return if i can.â€™
he ran on, down, down towards the outer city. men flying back from the burning passed him, and some seeing his livery turned and shouted, but he paid no heed. at last he was through the second gate, beyond which great fires leaped up between the walls. yet it seemed strangely silent. no noise or shouts of battle or din of arms could be heard. then suddenly there was

â€˜gandalf, gandalf! â€˜ cried pippin, and shadowfax halted.
â€˜what are you doing here?â€™ said gandalf. â€˜is it not a law in the city that those who wear the black and silver must stay in the citadel, unless their lord gives them leave?â€™
â€˜he has,â€™ said pippin. â€˜he sent me away. but i am frightened. something terrible may happen up there. the lord is out of his mind, i think. i am afraid he will kill himself, and kill faramir too. canâ€™t you do something?â€™
gandalf looked through the gaping gate, and already on the fields he heard the gathering sound of battle. he clenched his hand. â€˜i must go â€˜ he said. â€˜the black rider is abroad, and he will yet bring ruin on us. i have no time.â€™
â€˜but faramir!â€™ cried pippin. â€˜he is not dead, and they will burn him alive, if someone does not stop them.â€™
â€˜burn him alive?â€™ said gandalf. â€˜what is this tale? be quick!â€™
â€˜denethor has gone to the tombs,â€™ sai

â€˜maybe i can,â€™ said gandalf; â€˜but if i do, then others will die, i fear. well, i must come, since no other help can reach him. but evil and sorrow will come of this. even in the heart of our stronghold the enemy has power to strike us: for his will it is that is at work.â€™
then having made up his mind he acted swiftly; and catching up pippin and setting him before him, he turned shadowfax with a word. up the climbing streets of minas tirith they clattered, while the noise of war rose

â€˜what is this, my lord?â€™ said the wizard. â€˜the houses of the dead are no places for the living. and why do men fight here in the hallows when there is war enough before the gate? or has our enemy come even to rath dÃ­nen?â€™
â€˜since when has the lord of gondor been answerable to thee?â€™ said denethor. â€˜or may i not command my own servants?â€™
â€˜you may,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜but others may contest your will, when it is turned to madness and evil. where is your son, faramir?â€™
â€˜he lies within,â€™ said denethor, â€˜burning, already burning. they have set a fire in his flesh. but soon all shall be burned. the west has failed. it shall all go up in a great fire, and all shall be ended. ash! ash and smoke blown away on the wind!â€™
then gandalf seeing the madness that was on him feared that he had already done some evil deed, and he thrust forward, with beregond and pippin behind him, while denethor gave back until he stood beside the table within. but there they f

ound faramir, still dreaming in his fever, lying upon the table. wood was piled under it, and high all about it, and all was drenched with oil, even the garments of faramir and the coverlets; but as yet no fire had been set to the fuel. then gandalf revealed the strength that lay hid in him; even as the light of his power was hidden under his grey mantle. he leaped up on to the faggots, and raising the sick man lightly he sprang down again, and bore him towards the door. but as he did so faramir moaned and called on his father in his dream.
denethor started as one waking from a trance, and the flame died in his eyes, and he wept; and he said: â€˜do not take my son from me! he calls for me.â€™
â€˜he calls,â€™ said gandalf, â€˜but you cannot come to him yet. for he must seek healing on the threshold of death, and maybe find it not. whereas your part is to go out to the battle of your city, where maybe death awaits you. this you know in your heart.â€™

â€˜authority is not given to you, steward of gondor, to order the hour of your death,â€™ answered gandalf. â€˜and only the heathen kings, under the domination of the dark power, did thus, slaying themselves in pride and despair, murdering their kin to ease their own death.â€™ then passing through the door he took faramir from the deadly house and laid him on the bier on which he had been brought, and which had now been set in the porch. denethor followed him, and stood trembling, looking with longing on the face of his son. and for a moment, while all were silent and still, watching the lord in his throes, he wavered.
â€˜come!â€™ said gandalf. â€˜we are needed. there is much that you can yet do.â€™
then suddenly denethor laughed. he stood up tall and proud again, and stepping swiftly back to the table he lifted

â€˜to me it would not seem that a steward who faithfully surrenders his charge is diminished in love or in honour,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜and at the least you shall not rob your son of his choice while his death is still in doubt.â€™
at those words denethorâ€™s eyes flamed again, and taking the stone under his arm he drew a knife and strode towards the bier. but beregond sprang forward and set himself before faramir.
â€˜so!â€™ cried denethor. â€˜thou hadst already stolen half my sonâ€™s love. now thou stealest the hearts of my knights also, so that they rob me wholly of my son at the last. but in this at least thou shalt not defy my will: to rule my own end.â€™
â€˜come hither!â€™ he cried to his servants. â€˜come, if you are not all recreant!â€™ then two of them ran up the steps to him. swiftly he snatched a torch from the hand of one and sprang back into the house. before gandalf could hinder him he thrus

 said gandalf: then he turned to beregond and the lordâ€™s servants that stood there aghast. â€˜and so pass also the days of gondor that you have known; for good or evil they are ended. ill deeds have been done here; but let now all enmity that lies between you be put away, for it was contrived by the enemy and works his will. you have been caught in a net of warring duties that you did not weave. but think, you servants of the lord, blind in your obedience, that but for the treason of beregond faramir, captain of the white tower, would now also be burned.
â€˜bear away from this unhappy place your comrades who have fallen. and we will bear faramir, steward of gondor, to a place where he can sleep in peace, or die if that be his doom.â€™
then gandalf and beregond taking up the bier bore it away towards the houses of healing, while behind them walked pippin with downcast head. but the servants of the lord stood gazing as stricken men at the house of the dead; and even as gandalf came to the end

rry of fire; but still unabated the flames danced and flickered among the ruins. then in terror the servants fled and followed gandalf.
at length they came back to the stewardâ€™s door, and beregond looked with grief at the porter. â€˜this deed i shall ever rue,â€™ he said; â€˜but a madness of haste was on me, and he would not listen, but drew sword against me.â€™ then taking the key that he had wrested from the slain man he closed the door and locked it. â€˜this should now be given to the lord faramir,â€™ he said.
â€˜the prince of dol amroth is in command in the absence of the lord,â€™ said gandalf; â€˜but since he is not here, i must take this on myself. i bid you keep the key and guard it, until the city is set in order again.â€™
now at last they passed into the high circles of the city, and in the light of morning they went their way towards the houses of healing; and these were fair houses set apart, for the care of those who were grievously sick, but now they were prepared for the tendi

reat cry that went up from the field before the gate and rising shrill and piercing into the sky passed, and died away on the wind. so terrible was the cry that for a moment all stood still, and yet when it had passed, suddenly their hearts were lifted up in such a hope as they had not known since the darkness came out of the east; and it seemed to them that the light grew clear and the sun broke through the clouds.
but gandalfâ€™s face was grave and sad, and bidding beregond and pippin to take faramir into the houses of healing, he went up on to the walls nearby; and there like a figure carven in white he stood in the new sun and looked out. and he beheld with the sight that was given to him all that had befallen; and when Ã©omer rode out from the forefront of his battle and stood beside those who lay upon the field, he sighed, and he cast his cloak about him again, and went from the walls. and beregond and pippin found him standing in thought before the door of the houses when they came out

omir departed. he was too great to be subdued to the will of the dark power, he saw nonetheless only those things which that power permitted him to see. the knowledge which he obtained was, doubtless, often of service to him; yet the vision of the great might of mordor that was shown to him fed the despair of his heart until it overthrew his mind.â€™
â€˜now i understand what seemed so strange to me!â€™ said pippin shuddering at his memories as he spoke. â€˜the lord went away from the room where faramir lay; and it was only when he returned that i first thought he was changed, old and broken.â€™
â€˜it was in the very hour that faramir was brought to the tower that many of us saw a strange light in the topmost chamber,â€™ said beregond. â€˜but we have seen that light before, and it has long been rumoured in the city, that the lord would at times wrestle in thought with his enemy.â€™
â€˜alas! then i have guessed rightly,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜thus the will of sauron entered into minas tirith; and

 was not long before gandalf himself came in search of them. he stooped over merry and caressed his brow; then he lifted him carefully. â€˜he should have been borne in honour into this city,â€™ he said. â€˜he has well repaid my trust; for if elrond had not yielded to me, neither of you would have set out; and then far more grievous would the evils of this day have been.â€™ he sighed. â€˜and yet here is another charge on my hands, while all the time the battle hangs in the balance.â€™
so at last faramir and Ã©owyn and meriadoc were laid in beds in the houses of healing; and there they were tended well. for though all lore was in these latter days fallen from its fullness of old, the leechcraft of gondor was still wise, and skilled in the healing of wound and hurt, and all such sickness as east of the sea mortal men were subject to. save old age only. for that they had found no cure; and indeed the span of their lives had now waned to little more than that of other men, and those among them who

gandalf went from one to the other full of care, and he was told all that the watchers could hear. and so the day passed, while the great battle outside went on with shifting hopes and strange tidings; and still gandalf waited and watched and did not go forth; till at last the red sunset filled all the sky, and the light through the windows fell on the grey faces of the sick. then it seemed to those who stood by that in the glow the faces flushed softly

 as with health returning, but it was only a mockery of hope.
then an old wife, ioreth, the eldest of the women who served in that house, looking on the fair face of faramir, wept, for all the people loved him. and she said: â€˜alas! if he should die. would that there were kings in gondor, as there were once upon a time, they say! for it is said in old lore: the hands of the king are the hands of a healer. and so the rightful king could ever be known.â€™
and gandalf, who stood by, said: â€˜men may long remember your words, ioreth! for there is hope in them. maybe a king has indeed returned to gondor; or have you not heard the strange tidings that have come to the c

wiftly from the hall; and the prince followed him. and when they came forth evening had fallen and many stars were in the sky. and there came gandalf on foot and with him one cloaked in grey; and they met before the doors of the houses of healing. and they greeted gandalf and said: â€˜we seek the steward, and men say that he is in this house. has any hurt befallen him? and the lady Ã©owyn, where is she?â€™
and gandalf answered: â€˜she lies within and is not dead, but is near death. but the lord faramir was wounded by an evil dart, as you have heard, and he is now the steward; for denethor has departed, and his house is in ashes.â€™ and they were filled with grief and wonder at the tale that he told.
but imrahil said: â€˜so victory is shorn of gladness, and it is bitter bought, if both gondor and rohan are in one day bereft of their lords. Ã©omer rules the rohirrim. who shall rule the city meanwhile? shall we not send now for the lord aragorn?â€™
and the cloaked man spoke and said: â€˜he is co

then gandalf said: â€˜let us not stay at the door, for the time is urgent. let us enter! for it is only in the coming of aragorn that any hope remains for the sick that lie in the house. thus spake ioreth, wise-woman of gondor: the hands of the king are the hands of a healer, and so shall the rightful king be known.â€™
then aragorn entered first

and with that they passed into the house; and as they went towards the rooms where the sick were tended gandalf told of the deeds of Ã©owyn and meriadoc. â€˜for,â€™ he said, â€˜long have i stood by them and at first they spoke much in their dreaming, before they sank into the deadly darkness. also it is given to me to see many things far off.â€™
aragorn went first to faramir, and then to the lady Ã©owyn, and last to merry. when he had looked on the faces of the sick and seen their hurts he sighed. â€˜here i must put forth all such power and skill as is given to me,â€™ he said. â€˜would that elrond were here, for he is the eldest of all our race, and has the greater power.â€™
and Ã©omer seeing that he was sorrowful and weary said: â€˜first you must rest, surely, and at the least eat a little?â€™
but aragorn answered: â€˜nay, for these three, and most soon for farami

â€˜wholesome verily,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜and now, dame, if you love the lord faramir, run as quick as your tongue and get me kingsfoil, if there is a leaf in the city.â€™
â€˜and if not,â€™ said gandalf, â€˜i will ride to lossarnach with ioreth behind me, and she shall take me to the woods, but not to her sisters. and shadowfax shall show her the meaning of haste.â€™
when ioreth was gone, aragorn bade the other women to make water hot. then he took faramir's hand in his, and laid the other hand upon the sick manâ€™s brow. it was drenched with sweat; but faramir did not move or m

now aragorn knelt beside faramir, and held a hand upon his brow. and those that watched felt that some great struggle was going on. for aragornâ€™s face grew grey with weariness; and ever and anon he called the name of faramir, but each time more faintly to their hearing, as if aragorn himself was removed from them, and walked afar in some dark vale, calling for one that was lost.
and at last bergil came running in, and he bore six leaves in a cloth. â€˜it is kingsfoil, sir,â€™ he said; â€˜but not fresh, i fear. it must have b

but aragorn smiled. â€˜it will serve,â€™ he said. â€˜the worst is now over. stay and be comforted!â€™ then taking two leaves, he laid them on his hands and breathed on them, and then he crushed them, and straightway a living freshness filled the room, as if the air itself awoke and tingled, sparkling with joy. and then he cast the leaves into the bowls of steaming water that were brought to him, and at once all hearts were lightened. for the fragrance that came to each was

like a memory of dewy mornings of unshadowed sun in some land of which the fair world in spring is itself but a fleeting memory. but aragorn stood up as one refreshed, and his eyes smiled as he held a bowl before faramirâ€™s dreaming face.
â€˜well now! who would have believed it?â€™ said ioreth to a woman that stood beside her. â€˜the weed is better than i thought. it reminds me of the roses of imloth melui when i was a lass, and no king could ask for better.â€™
suddenly faramir stirred, and he opened his eyes, and he looked on aragorn who bent over him; and a light of knowledge and love was kindled in his eyes, and he spoke softly. â€˜my lord, you called me. i come. what does the king command?â€™
â€˜walk no more in the shadows, but awake!â€™ said aragorn. â€˜you are weary. rest a while, and take food, and be ready when i return.â€™
â€˜i will, lord,â€™ said faramir. â€˜for who would lie idle when the king has returned?â€™
â€˜farewell then for a while!â€™ said aragorn.

aragorn and gandalf went now to the warden of the houses of healing, and they counselled him that faramir and Ã©owyn should remain there and still be tended with care for many days.
â€˜the lady Ã©owyn,â€™ said aragorn, â€˜will wish soon to rise and depart; but she should not be permitted to do so, if you can in any way restrain her, until at least ten days be passed.â€™

now in their debate some had counselled that minas morgul should first be assailed, and if they might take it, it should be utterly destroyed. â€˜and, maybe,â€™ said imrahil, â€˜the road that leads thence to the pass above will prove an easier way of assault upon the dark lord than his northern gate.â€™
but against this gandalf had spoken urgently, because of the evil that dwelt in the valley, where the minds of living men would turn to madness and horror, and because also of the news that faramir had brought. for if the ring-bearer had indeed attempted that way, then above all they should not draw the eye of mordor thither. so the next day when the main host came up, they set a strong guard upon the cross-roads to make some defence, if mordor should send a force over the morgul pass, or should bring more men up from the south. for that guard they chose mostly archers who knew the ways of ithilien and would lie hid in the woods and slopes about the meeting of the ways. but gandalf and ar

nonetheless, though they marched in seeming peace, the hearts of all the army, from the highest to the lowest, were downcast, and with every mile that they went north foreboding of evil grew heavier on them. it was near the end of the second day of their march from the cross-roads that they first met any offer of battle. for a strong force of orcs and easterlings attempted to take their leading companies in an ambush; and that was in the very place where faramir had waylaid the men of harad, and the road went in a deep cutting through an out-thrust of the eastward hills. but the captains of the west were well warned by their scouts, skilled men from henneth annÃ»n led by mablung; and so the ambush was itself trapped. for horsemen went wide about westward and came up on the flank of the enemy and from behind, and they were destroyed or driven east into the hills.
but the victory did little to enhearten the captains. â€˜it is but a feint,â€™ said aragorn

`no, they eat and drink, sam. the shadow that bred them can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own. i donâ€™t think it gave life to the ores, it only ruined them and twisted them; and if they are to live at all, the

`well, things are a bit better than you think,â€™ said frodo. â€˜i have had a bit of luck while you were away. indeed they did not take everything. iâ€™ve found my food-bag among some rags on the floor. theyâ€™ve rummaged it, of course. but i guess they disliked the very look and smell of the lembas, worse than gollum did. itâ€™s scattered about and some of it is trampled and broken, but iâ€™ve gathered it together. itâ€™s not far short of what youâ€™ve got. but theyâ€™ve taken faramirâ€™s food, and theyâ€™ve slashed up my water-bottle.â€™
`well, thereâ€™s no more to be said,â€™ said sam. `weâ€™ve got enough to start on. but the waterâ€™s going to be a bad business. but come mr. frodo! off we go, or a whole lake of it wonâ€™t do us any good!â€™
â€˜not till youâ€™ve had a mouthful, sam,â€™ said frodo. `i wonâ€™t budge. here, take this elven-cake, and drink that last drop in your bottle! the whole thing is quite hopeless, so itâ€™s no good worrying about tomorrow. it probably w

there they sat and made such a meal as they could. keeping back the precious lembas for the evil days ahead, they ate the half of what remained in samâ€™s bag of faramirâ€™s provision: some dried fruit, and a small slip of cured meat; and they sipped some water. they had drunk again from the pools in the valley, but they were very, thirsty again. there was a bitter tang in the air of mordor that dried the mouth. when sam thought of water even his hopeful spirit quailed. beyond the morgai there was the dreadful plain of gorgoroth to cross.

â€˜do you remember that bit of rabbit, mr. frodo?â€™ he said. â€˜and our place under the warm bank in captain faramirâ€™s country, the day i saw an oliphaunt?â€™
â€˜no, i am afraid not, sam,â€™ said frodo. â€˜at least, i know that such things happened, but i cannot see them. no taste of food, no feel of water, no sound of wind, no memory of tree or grass or flower, no image of moon or star are left to me. i am naked in the dark. sam, and there is no veil between me and the wheel of fire. i begin to see it even with my waking eyes, and all else fades.â€™

â€˜is there no deed to do?â€™ she said. â€˜who commands in this city?â€™
â€˜i do not rightly know,â€™ he answered. â€˜such things are not my care. there is a marshal over the riders of rohan; and the lord hÃºrin, i am told, commands the men of gondor. but the lord faramir is by right the steward of the city.â€™

â€˜in this house, lady. he was sorely hurt, but is now set again on the way to health. but i do not know-â€˜
â€˜will you not bring me to him? then you will know.â€™

â€˜do not misunderstand him, lord,â€™ said Ã©owyn. â€˜it is not lack of care that grieves me. no houses could be fairer, for those who desire to be healed. but i cannot lie in sloth, idle, caged. i looked for death in battle. but i have not died, and battle still goes on.â€™
at a sign from faramir, the warden bowed and departed. â€˜what would you have me do, lady?â€™ said faramir. â€˜i also am a prisoner of the healers.â€™ he looked at her, and being a man whom pity deeply stirred, it seemed to him that her loveliness amid her grief would pierce his heart. and she looked at him and saw the grave tenderness in his eyes, and yet knew, for she was bred among men of war, that here was one whom no rider of the mark would outmatch in battle.

â€˜i would have you command this warden, and bid him let me go,â€™ she said; but though her words were still proud, her heart faltered, and for the first time she doubted herself. she guessed that this tall man, both stern and gentle, might think her merely wayward, like a child that has not the firmness of mind to go on with a dull task to the end.
â€˜i myself am in the wardenâ€™s keeping,â€™ answered faramir. â€˜nor have i yet taken up my authority in the city. but had i done so, i should still listen to his counsel, and should not cross his will in matters of his craft, unless in some great need.â€™
â€˜but i do not desire healing,â€™ she said. â€˜i wish to ride to war like my brother Ã©omer, or better like thÃ©oden the king, for he died and has both honour and peace.â€™

faramir smiled, though his heart was filled with pity. â€˜your window does not look eastward?â€™ he said. â€˜that can be amended. in this i will command the warden. if you will stay in this house in our care, lady, and take your rest, then you shall walk in this garden in the sun, as you will; and you shall look east, whither all our hopes have gone. and here you will find me, walking and waiting, and also looking east. it would ease my care, if you would speak to me, or walk at whiles with me.â€™

when he returned to his chamber he called for the warden, and heard all that he could tell of the lady of rohan.
â€˜but i doubt not, lord,â€™ said the warden, â€˜that you would learn more from the halfling that is with us; for he was in the riding of the king, and with the lady at the end, they say.â€™
and so merry was sent to faramir, and while that day lasted they talked lon

g together, and faramir learned much, more even than merry put into words; and he thought that he understood now something of the grief and unrest of Ã©owyn of rohan. and in the fair evening faramir and merry walked in the garden, but she did not come.
but in the morning, as faramir came from the houses, he saw her, as she stood upon the walls; and she was clad all in white, and gleamed in the sun. and he called to her, and she came down, and they walked on the grass or sat under a green tree together, now in silence, now in speech. and each day after they did likewise. and the warden looking from his window was glad in heart. for he was a healer. and his care was lightened; and certain it was that, heavy as was the dread and foreboding of those days upon the hearts of men

, still these two of his charges prospered and grew daily in strength.
and so the fifth day came since the lady Ã©owyn went first to faramir; and they stood now together once more upon the walls of the city and looked out. no tidings had yet come, and all hearts were darkened. the weather, too, was bright no longer. it was cold. a wind that had sprung up in the night was blowing now keenly from the north, and it was rising; but the lands about looked grey and drear.
they were clad in warm raiment and heavy cloaks, and over all the lady Ã©owyn wore a great blue mantle of the colour of deep summer-night, and it was set with silver sta

but she now shivered beneath the starry mantle, and she looked northward, above the grey hither lands, into the eye of th

â€˜what do you look for, Ã©owyn?â€™ said faramir.

â€˜seven days,â€™ said faramir. â€˜but think not ill of me, if i say to you: they have brought me both a joy and a pain that i never thought to know. joy to see you; but pain, because now the fear and doubt of this evil time are grown dark indeed. Ã©owyn, i would not have this world end now, or lose so soon what i have found.â€™

â€˜yes, we wait for the stroke of doom,â€™ said faramir. and they said no more; and it seemed to them as they stood upon the wall that the wind died, and the light failed, and the sun was bleared, and all sounds in the city or in the lands about were hushed: neither wind, nor voice, nor bird-call, nor rustle of leaf, nor their own breath could be heard; the very beating of their hearts was stilled. time halted.
and as they stood so, their hands met and clasped, though they did not know it. and still they waited for they knew not what. then presently

 it seemed to them that above the ridges of the distant mountains another vast mountain of darkness rose, towering up like a wave that should engulf the world, and about it lightnings flickered; and then a tremor ran through the earth, and they felt the walls of the city quiver. a sound like a sigh went up from all the lands about them; and their hearts beat suddenly again.
â€˜it reminds me of nÃºmenor,â€™ said faramir, and wondered to hear himself speak.
â€˜of nÃºmenor?â€™ said Ã©owyn.
â€˜yes,â€™ said faramir, â€˜of the land of westernesse that foundered and of the great dark wave climbing over the green lands and above the hills, and coming on, darkness unescapable. i often dream of it.â€™
â€˜then you think that the darkness is coming?â€™ said Ã©owyn. â€˜darkness unescapable?â€™ and suddenly she drew close to him.

the days that followed were golden, and spring and summer joined and made revel together in the fields of gondor. and tidings now came by swift riders from cair andros of all that was done, and the city made ready for the coming of the king. merry was summoned and rode away with the wains that took store of goods to osgiliath and thence by ship to cair andros; but faramir did not go, for now being healed he took upon him his authority and the stewardship, although it was only for a little while, and his duty was to prepare for one who should replace him.
and Ã©owyn did not go, though her brother sent word begging her to come to the field of cormallen. and faramir wondered at this, but he saw her seldom, being busy with many matters; and she dwelt still in the houses of healing and walked alone in the garden, and her face grew pale again, and it seemed that in al

then faramir came and sought her, and once more they stood on the walls together; and he said to her: â€˜Ã©owyn, why do you tarry here, and do not go to the rejoicing in cormallen beyond cair andros, where your brother awaits you?â€™
and she said: â€˜do you not know?â€™
but he answered: â€˜two reasons there may be, but which is true, l do not know.â€™
and she said: â€˜i do not wish to play at riddles. speak plainer!â€™
â€˜then if you will have it so, lady,â€™ he said: â€˜you do not go, because only your bro

and Ã©owyn looked at faramir long and steadily; and faramir said: â€˜do not scorn pity that is the gift of a gentle heart, Ã©owyn! but i do not offer you my pity. for you are a lady high and valiant and have yourself won renown that shall not be forgotten; and you are a lady beautiful, i deem, beyond even the words of the elven-tongue to tell. and i love you. once i pitied your sorrow. but now, were you sorrowless, without fear or any lack, were you the blissful queen of gondor, still i would love you.

then the heart of Ã©owyn changed, or else at last she understood it. and suddenly her winter passed, and the sun shone on her.
i stand in minas anor, the tower of the sun, she said; and behold the shadow has departed! i will be a shieldmaiden no longer, nor vie with the great riders, nor take joy only in the songs of slaying. i will be a healer, and love all things that grow and are not barren.â€™ and again she looked at faramir. â€˜no longer do i desire to be a queen,â€™ she said.
then faramir laughed merrily. â€˜that is well,â€™ he said; â€˜for i am not a king. yet i will wed with the white lady of rohan, if it be her will. and if she will, then let us cross the river and in happier days let us dwell in fair ithilien and there make a garden. all things will grow with joy there, if the white lady comes.â€™
â€˜then must i leave my own people, man of gondor?â€™ she said. â€˜and would you have your proud folk say of you:

 â€œthere goes a lord who tamed a wild shieldmaiden of the north! was there no woman of the race of nÃºmenor to choose?â€â€™
â€˜i would,â€™ said faramir. and he took her in his arms and kissed her under the sunlit sky, and he cared not that they stood high upon the walls in the sight of many. and many indeed saw them and the light that shone about them as they came down from the walls and went hand in hand to the houses of healing.
and to the warden of the houses faramir said: â€˜here is the lady Ã©owyn of rohan, and now she is healed.â€™
and the warden said: â€˜then i release her from my charge and bid her farewell, and may she suffer never hurt nor sickness again. i commend her to the care of the steward of the city, until her brother returns.â€™
but Ã©owyn said: â€˜yet now that i have leave to depart, i would remain. for this house has become to me of all dwellings the most blessed.â€™ and she remained there until king Ã©omer came.

now the captains of the west led their host towards the city, and folk saw them advance in line upon line, flashing and glinting in the sunrise and rippling like silver. and so they came before the gateway and halted a furlong from the walls. as yet no gates had been set up again, but a barrier was laid across the entrance to the city, and there stood men at arms in silver and black with long swords drawn. before the barrier stood faramir the steward, and hÃºrin warden of the keys, and other captains of gondor, and the lady Ã©owyn of rohan with elfhelm the marshal and many knights of the mark; and upon either side of the gate was a great press of fair people in raiment of many colours and garlands of flowers.
so now there was a wide space before the walls of minas tirith, and it was hemmed in upon all sides by the knights and the soldiers of gondor and of rohan, and by the people of the city and of all parts of the land. a hush

but ioreth was not permitted to continue the instruction of her kinswoman from the country, for a single trumpet rang, and a dead silence followed. then forth from the gate went faramir with hÃºrin of the keys, and no others, save that behind them walked four men in the high helms and armour of the citadel, and they bore a great casket of black lebethron bound with silver.
faramir met aragorn in the midst of those there assembled, and he knelt, and said: â€˜the last steward of gondor begs leave to surrender his office.â€™ and he held out a white rod; but aragorn took the rod and gave it back, saying: â€˜that office is not ended, and it shall be thine and thy heirsâ€™ as long a

and ioreth said to her kinswoman: â€˜this is just a ceremony such as we have in the city, cousin; for he has already entered, as i was telling you; and he said to me-â€˜ and then again she was obliged to silence, for faramir spoke again.
â€˜men of gondor, the loremasters tell that it was the custom of old that the king should receive the crown from his father ere he died; or if that might not be, that he should go alone and take it from the hands of his father in the tomb where he was laid. but since things must now be done otherwise, using the authority of the steward, i have today brought hither from rath dÃ­nen the crown of eÃ¤rnur the last king, whose days passed in the time of our longfathers of old.â€™

then aragorn took the crown and held it up an

and those were the words that elendil spoke when he came up out of the sea on the wings of the wind: â€˜out of the great sea to middle-earth i am come. in this place will i abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.â€™
then to the wonder of many aragorn did not put the crown upon his head, but gave it back to faramir, and said: â€˜by the labour and valour of many i have come into my inheritance. in token of this i would have the ring-bearer bring the crown to me, and let mithrandir set it upon my head, if he will; for he has been the mover of all that has been accomplished, and this is his victory.â€™
then frodo came forward and took the crown from faramir and bore it to gandalf; and aragorn knelt, and gandalf set the white crown upon his head, and said:

but when aragorn arose all that beheld him gazed in silence, for it seemed to them that he was revealed to them now for the first time. tall as the sea-kings of old, he stood above all that were near; ancient of days he seemed and yet in the flower of manhood; and wisdom sat upon his brow, and strength and healing were in his hands, and a light was about him. and then faramir cried:
â€˜behold the king!â€™
and in that moment all the trumpets were blown, and the king elessar went forth and came to the barrier, and hÃºrin of the keys thrust it back; and amid the music of harp and of viol and of flute and the singing of clear voices the king passed through the flower-laden streets, and came to the citadel, and entered in; and the banner of the tree and the stars was unfurled upon the topmost tower, and the reign of king elessar began, of which many songs have told.

and the king said to beregond: â€˜beregond, by your sword blood was spilled in the hallows, where that is forbidden. also you left your post without leave of lord or of captain. for these things, of old, death was the penalty. now therefore i must pronounce your doom.
â€˜all penalty is remitted for your valour in battle, and still more because all that you did was for the love of the lord faramir. nonetheless you must leave the guard of the citadel, and you must go forth from the city of minas tirith.â€™
then the blood left beregondâ€™s face, and he was stricken to the heart and bowed his head. but the king said.:
â€˜so it must be, for you are appointed to the white company, the guard of faramir, prince of ithilien, and you shall be its captain and dwell in emyn arnen in honour and peace, and in the service of him for whom you risked all, to save him from death.â€™

â€˜for,â€™ said he, â€˜minas ithil in morgul vale shall be utterly destroyed, and though it may in time to come be made clean, no man may dwell there for many long years.â€™
and last of all aragorn greeted Ã©omer of rohan, and they embraced, and aragorn said: â€˜between us there can be no word of giving or taking, nor of reward; for we are brethren. in happy hour did eorl ride from the north, a

and Ã©owyn said to faramir: â€˜now i must go back to my own land and look on it once again, and help my brother in his labour; but when one whom i long loved as father is laid at last to rest, i will return.â€™
so the glad days passed; and on the eighth day of may the riders of rohan made ready, and rode off by the north-way, and with them went the sons of elrond. all the road was lined with people to do them honour and praise them, from the gate of the city to the walls of the pelennor. then all others that dwelt afar w
