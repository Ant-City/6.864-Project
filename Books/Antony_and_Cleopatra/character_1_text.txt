enobarbus.
what's your pleasure, sir?

antony.
i must with haste from hence.

enobarbus.
why, then we kill all our women: we see how mortal an unkindness
is to them; if they suffer our departure, death's the word.

antony.
i must be gone.

enobarbus.
under a compelling occasion, let women die: it were pity to cast
them away for nothing; though, between them and a great cause
they should be esteemed nothing. cleopatra, catching but the
least noise of this, dies instantly; i have seen her die twenty
times upon far poorer moment: i do think there is mettle in
death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a
celerity in dying.

antony.
she is cunning past man's thought.

enobarbus.
alack, sir, no: her passions are made of nothing but the finest
part of pure love: we cannot call her winds and waters, sighs and
tears; they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can
report: this c

in an onion that should water this sorrow.

the business she hath broached in the state
cannot endure my absence.

enobarbus.
and the business you have broached here cannot be without you;
especially that of cleopatra's, which wholly depends on your
abode.

antony.
no more light answers. let our officers
have notice what we purpose. i shall break
the cause of our expedience to the queen,
and get her leave to part. for not alone
the death of fulvia, with more urgent touches,
do strongly speak to us; but the letters too

cleopatra.
pray you, stand farther from me.

antony.
what's the matter?

cleopatra.
i know by that same eye there's some good news.

antony.
cleopatra,--

cleopatra.
why should i think you can be mine and true,
though you in swearing shake the throned gods,
who have been false to fulvia? riotous madness,
to be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
which break themselves in swearing!

antony.
most sweet queen,--

cleopatra.
nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,
but bid farewell, and go: when you su'd staying,
then was the time for words: no going then;--
eternity was in our lips and eyes,
bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor
but was a race of heaven: they are so still,
or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
art turn'd the greatest liar.

antony.
how now, lady!

cleopatra.
i would i had thy inches; thou shouldst know
there were a heart in egypt.

antony.

makes his approaches to the port of rome;
equality of two domestic powers
breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,
are newly grown to love: the condemn'd pompey,
rich in his father's honour, creeps apace
into the hearts of such as have not thriv'd
upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
and quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
by any desperate change. my more particular,
and that which most with you should safe my going,
is fulvia's death.

cleopatra.
though age from folly could not give me freedom,
it does from childishness:--can fulvia die?

caesar.
you may see, lepidus, and henceforth know,
it is not caesar's natural vice to hate
our great competitor. from alexandria
this is the news:--he fishes, drinks, and wastes
the lamps of night in revel: is not more manlike
than cleopatra;, nor the queen of ptolemy
more womanly than he: hardly gave audience, or
vouchsaf'd to think he had partners: you shall find there
a man who is the abstract of all faults
that all men follow.

lepidus.
i must not think there are
evils enow to darken all his goodness:
his faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,
more fiery by night's blackness; hereditary
rather than purchas'd; what he cannot change
than what he chooses.

you are too indulgent. let's grant it is not

like to the time o' the year between the extremes

cleopatra.
o well-divided disposition!--note him,
note him, good charmian; 'tis the man; but note him:
he was not sad,--for he would shine on those
that make their looks by his; he was not merry,--
which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
in egypt with his joy; but between both:
o heavenly mingle!--be'st thou sad or merry,
the violence of either thee becomes,
so does it no man else.--mett'st thou my posts?

why do you send so thick?

be brooch'd with me; if knife, drugs, serpents, have
edge, sting, or operation, i am safe;

dolabella.
most sovereign creature,--

cleopatra.
his legs bestrid the ocean; his rear'd arm
crested the world: his voice was propertied
as all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
but when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
he was as rattling thunder. for his bounty,
there was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
that grew the more by reaping: his delights
were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above
the element they liv'd in: in his livery
walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were
as plates dropp'd from his pocket.

you lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
but if there be, or ever were, one such,
it's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff
to vie strange forms with fancy: yet to imagine
an antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
condemning shadows quite.

dolabella.
hear me, good madam.
your loss is, as yourself, great; and you bear it

parcel the sum of my disgraces by

cleopatra,
not what you have reserv'd, nor what acknowledg'd,
put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours,
bestow it at your pleasure; and believe
caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you
of things that merchants sold. therefore be cheer'd;
make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;
