     the tug came back downstream, the water shearing in long rolling 
cylinders, rocking the float at last with the echo of passage, the float 
lurching onto the rolling cylinder with a plopping sound and a long jarring 
noise as the door rolled back and two men emerged, carrying a shell. they 
set it in the water and a moment later bland came out, with the sculls. he 
wore flannels, a gray jacket and a stiff straw hat. either he or his mother 
had read somewhere that oxford students pulled in flannels and stiff hats, 

so early one march they bought gerald a one pair shell and in his flannels 
and stiff hat he went on the river. the folks at the boathouse threatened to 
call a policeman, but he went anyway. his mother came down in a hired 
auto, in a fur suit like an arctic explorer's, and saw him off in a twenty-five 
mile wi

e to hold 
my throat so tight. i got up. "i'm ready. which way?"   
      we followed the path, the two others watching julio and the little girl 
and the boys somewhere in the rear. the path went along the river to the 
bridge. we crossed it and the tracks, people coming to the doors to look at 
us and more boys materialising from somewhere until when we turned into 
the main street we had quite a procession. before the drug store stood an 
auto, a big one, but i didn't recognise them until mrs bland said,   
     " why, quentin! quentin compson!" then i saw gerald, and spoade in 
the back seat, sitting on the back of his neck. and shreve. i didn't know the 
two girls.   
     "quentin compson!" mrs bland said.   
     " good afternoon," i said, raising my hat. "i'm under arrest. i'm sorry i

     "under arrest?" shreve said. "excuse me," he said. he heaved himself 
up and climbed over their feet and got out. he had on a pair of my flannel

ants, like a glove. i didn't remember forgetting them. i didn't remember 
how many chins mrs bland had, either. the prettiest girl was with gerald 
in front, too. they watched me through veils, with a kind of delicate horror. 
"who's under arrest?" shreve said. "what's this, mister?"   
     "gerald," mrs bland said. "send these people away. you get in this car, 
quentin."   
      gerald got out. spoade hadn't moved.   
     "what's he done, cap?" he said. "robbed a hen house?"   
     "i warn you," anse said. "do you know the prisoner?"   
     "know him," shreve said. "look here--"   
     "then you can come along to the squire's. you'reobstructing justice. 
come along." he shook my arm.   
     "well, good afternoon," i said. "i'm glad to have seen you all. sorry i 
couldn't be with you."

"you, gerald," mrs bland said.   
     "look here, constable," gerald said.   
     "i warn you you're interfering with an officer of the law," anse said. "if 
you've anything to say, you can come to the squire's and make cognizance 
of the prisoner." we went on. quite a procession now, anse and i leading. i 
could hear them telling them what it was, and spoade asking questions, 
and then julio said something violently in italian and i looked back and 
saw the little girl standing at the curb, looking at me with her fr

on here," spoade said, taking his arm. "good afternoon, judge. 
much obliged." as we passed out the door julio's voice rose again, violent, 
then ceased. spoade was looking at me, his brown eyes quizzical, a little 
cold. "well, bud, i reckon you'll do your girl chasing in boston after this."   
     "you damned fool," shreve said. "what the hell do you mean anyway, 
straggling off here, fooling with these damn wops?"   
     "come on," spoade said. "they must be getting impatient."   
      mrs bland was talking to them. they were miss holmes and miss 
daingerfield and they quit listening to her and looked at me again with that 
delicate and curious horror, their veils turned back upon their little white 
noses and their eyes fleeing and mysterious beneath the veils.   
     "quentin compson," mrs bland said. "what would your mother say. a 
young man naturally gets into scrapes, but to be arrested on foot by a 
country policeman. what did they think he'd done, gerald?"   
     "nothing," ge

     "nonsense. what was it, you, spoade?"   
     "he was trying to kidnap that little dirty girl, but they caught him in 
time," spoade said.   
     "nonsense," mrs bland said, but her voice sort of died away and she 
stared at me for a moment, and the girls drew their breaths in with a soft 
concerted sound. "fiddlesticks," mrs bland said briskly. "if that isn't just 
like these ignorant lowclass yankees. get in, quentin."   
      shreve and i sat on two small collapsible seats. gerald cranked the car 
and got in and we started.   
     "now, quentin, you tell me what all this foolishness is about," mrs 
bland said. i told them, shreve hunched and furious on his little seat and 
spoade sitting again on the back of his neck beside miss daingerfield.

daughter with, until the police showed him up at his nefarious work."   
     "hush up, spoade," mrs bland said. we drove down the street and 

crossed the bridge and passed the house where the pink garment hung in 
the window. "that's what you get for not reading my note. why didn't you 
come and get it? mr mackenzie says he told you it was there."   
     "yessum. i intended to, but i never went back to the room."   
     "you'd have let us sit there waiting i dont know how long, if it hadn't 
been for mr mackenzie. when he said you hadn't come back, that left an

couldn't stop it and then i knew that if i tried too hard to stop it i'd be 
crying and i thought about how i'd thought about i could not be a virgin, 
with so many of them walking along in the shadows and whispering with 
their soft girlvoices lingering in the shadowy places and the words coming 
out and perfume and eyes you could feel not see, but if it was that simple to 
do it wouldn't be anything and if it wasn't anything, what was i and then 
mrs bland said, "quentin? is he sick, mr mackenzie?" and then shreve's 
fat hand touched my knee and spoade began talking and i quit trying to 
stop it.

brought a hamper of wine because i think young gentlemen should drink 
wine, although my father, gerald's grandfather  "     ever do that have you

     "all right. i'm sorry i didn't bleed on him a little, at least."   
     "son of a bitch," shreve said. spoade came out of the house, talking to 
the woman i reckon, and crossed the yard. he looked at me with his cold, 
quizzical eyes.   
     "well, bud," he said, looking at me, "i'll be damned if you dont go to a 
lot of trouble to have your fun. kidnapping, then fighting. what do you do 
on your holidays? burn houses?"   
     "i'm all right," i said. "what did mrs bland say?"   
     "she's giving gerald hell for bloodying you up. she'll give you hell for 
letting him, when she sees you. she dont object to the fighting, it's the 
blood that annoys her. i think you lost caste with her a little by not holding 
your blood better. how do you feel?"   
     "sure," shreve said. "if you cant be a bland, the next best thing is to 
commit adultery with one or get drunk and fight him, as the case may be."

wouldn't come back because my clothes were spoiled."   
     "look here," he said. "what are you up to?"   
     "nothing. i'm all right. you and spoade go on back. i'll see you 
tomorrow." i went on across the yard, toward the road.   
     "do you know where the station is?" shreve said.   
     "i'll find it. i'll see you all tomorrow. tell mrs bland i'm sorry i spoiled 
her party." they stood watching me. i went around the house. a rock path 
went down to the road. roses grew on both sides of the path. i went 
through the gate, onto the road. it dropped downhill, toward the woods, 
and i could make out the auto beside the road. i went up the hill. the light 
increased as i mounted, and before i reached the top i heard a car. it 
sounded far away across the twilight and i stopped and listened to it. i 
couldn't make out the auto any longer,

left wall when i entered, but it was empty: just the stairs curving up into 
shadows echoes of feet in the sad generations like light dust upon the 
shadows, my feet waking them like dust, lightly to settle again.   
      i could see the letter before i turned the light on, propped against a 
book on the table so i would see it.   
      calling him my husband. and then spoade said they were going 
somewhere, would not be back until late, and mrs bland would need

for an hour because after six oclock. i took out my watch and listened to it 
clicking away, not knowing it couldn't even lie. then i laid it face up on the 
table and took mrs bland's letter and tore it across and dropped the pieces 
into the waste basket and took off my coat, vest, collar, tie and shirt. the tie 
was spoiled too, but then niggers. maybe a pattern of blood he could call 
that the one chris

the cellar door. he stood aside and she peered down into the obscurity 
odorous of dank earth and mold and rubber.

innocent and open. "i dont know whut you up to, but you aint got no
