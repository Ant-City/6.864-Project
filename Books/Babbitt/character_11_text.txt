lunch--said they wanted to have us up to the house for dinner before
long."

she achieved, "oh, it's just been one of those quiet evenings that are
often so much more enjoyable than noisy parties where everybody talks at
once and doesn't really settle down to-nice quiet enjoyment."

but from his cot on the sleeping-porch he heard her weeping, slowly,
without hope.

for a month they watched the social columns, and waited for a return
dinner-invitation.

as the hosts of sir gerald doak, the mckelveys were headlined all the
week after the babbitts' dinner. zenith ardently received sir gerald
(who had come to america to buy coal). the newspapers interviewed him
on prohibition, ireland, unemployment, naval aviation, the rate of
exchange, tea-drinking versus whisky-drinking, the psychology of
american women, and daily life as lived by english county families. sir
gerald seemed to have heard of all those topics. the mckelveys gave him
a singhalese dinner, and miss elnora pearl bat

advocate-times, rose to her highest lark-note. babbitt read aloud at
breakfast-table:


'twixt the original and oriental decorations, the strange and delicious
food, and the personalities both of the distinguished guests, the
charming hostess and the noted host, never has zenith seen a more
recherche affair than the ceylon dinner-dance given last evening by mr.
and mrs. charles mckelvey to sir gerald doak. methought as we--fortunate
one!--were privileged to view that fairy and foreign scene, nothing at
monte carlo or the choicest ambassadorial sets of foreign capitals could
be more lovely. it is not for nothing that zenith is in matters social
rapidly becoming known as the choosiest inland city in the country.

though he is too modest to admit it, lord doak gives a cachet to our
smart quartier such as it has not received since the ever-memorable
visit of the earl of sittingbourne. not only is he

n a plush chair bedecked with the saxe-coburg arms, lighting a cigar
and looking for some one who would come and play with him and save him
from thinking. in the chair next to him (showing the arms of lithuania)
was a half-familiar man, a large red-faced man with pop eyes and a
deficient yellow mustache. he seemed kind and insignificant, and as
lonely as babbitt himself. he wore a tweed suit and a reluctant orange
tie.

it came to babbitt with a pyrotechnic crash. the melancholy stranger was
sir gerald doak.

instinctively babbitt rose, bumbling, "how 're you, sir gerald? 'member
we met in zenith, at charley mckelvey's? babbitt's my name--real
estate."

"oh! how d' you do." sir gerald shook hands flabbily.

embarrassed, standing, wondering how he could retreat, babbitt
maundered, "well, i suppose you been having a great trip since we saw
you in zenith."

"quite. british columbia and california and all over the place," he said
doubtfully, looking at babbitt lifelessly.

"how did you find business c

tching his chair over, shouting, "movie?
say, sir gerald, i supposed of course you had a raft of dames waiting to
lead you out to some soiree--"

"god forbid!"

"--but if you haven't, what do you say you and me go to a movie? there's
a peach of a film at the grantham: bill hart in a bandit picture."

"right-o! just a moment while i get my coat."

swollen with greatness, slightly afraid lest the noble blood of
nottingham change its mind and leave him at any street corner, babbitt
paraded with sir gerald doak to the movie palace and in silent bliss sat
beside him, trying not to be too enthusiastic, lest the knight despise
his adoration of six-shooters and broncos. at the end sir gerald
murmured, "jolly good picture, this. so awfully decent of you to take
me. haven't enjoyed myself so much for weeks. all these hostesses--they
never let you go to the cinema!"

"the devil you say!" babbitt's speech had lost the delicate refinement
and all the broad a's with which he had adorned it, and become hearty

latch-string is always out."

"and don't forget, old boy, if you ever come to nottingham, mother and
i will be frightfully glad to see you. i shall tell the fellows in
nottingham your ideas about visions and real guys--at our next rotary
club luncheon."

babbitt lay abed at his hotel, imagining the zenith athletic club asking
him, "what kind of a time d'you have in chicago?" and his answering,
"oh, fair; ran around with sir gerald doak a lot;" picturing himself
meeting lucile mckelvey and admonishing her, "you're all right, mrs.
mac, when you aren't trying to pull this highbrow pose. it's just as
gerald doak says to me in chicago--oh, yes, jerry's an old friend of
mine--the wife and i are thinking of running over to england to stay
with jerry in his castle, next year--and he said to me, 'georgie, old
bean, i like lucile first-rate, but you and me, george, we got to make
her get over this highty-tighty hooptediddle way she's g

pair of birds! but i think we're pretty darn nice!"

"yes, i think we're lots nicer than most people i know!" they smiled.
"but please tell me what you said at the club."

"well, it was like this: course seneca doane is a friend of mine--they
can say what they want to, they can call him anything they please, but
what most folks here don't know is that senny is the bosom pal of some
of the biggest statesmen in the world--lord wycombe, frinstance--you
know, this big british nobleman. my friend sir gerald doak told me
that lord wycombe is one of the biggest guns in england--well, doak or
somebody told me."

"oh! do you know sir gerald? the one that was here, at the mckelveys'?"

"know him? well, say, i know him just well enough so we call each other
george and jerry, and we got so pickled together in chicago--"

"that must have been fun. but--" she shook a finger at him. "--i can't
have you getting pickled! i'll have to take you in hand!"

"wish you would! . . . well, zize saying: you see i happen to

him! can you beat it for nerve? some nerve i
call it!"

"did you notice how dotty was dancing? gee, wasn't she the limit!"

babbitt was to be heard sonorously agreeing with the once-hated miss
minnie sonntag that persons who let a night go by without dancing to
jazz music were crabs, pikers, and poor fish; and he roared "you bet!"
when mrs. carrie nork gurgled, "don't you love to sit on the floor? it's
so bohemian!" he began to think extremely well of the bunch. when he
mentioned his friends sir gerald doak, lord wycombe, william washington
eathorne, and chum frink, he was proud of their condescending interest.
he got so thoroughly into the jocund spirit that he didn't much mind
seeing tanis drooping against the shoulder of the youngest and milkiest
of the young men, and he himself desired to hold carrie nork's pulpy
hand, and dropped it only because tanis looked angry.

when he went home, at two, he was fully a member of the bunch, and
all the week thereafter he was bound by the exceedingly strai
