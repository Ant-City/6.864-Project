Yevgeny Sergeyevich Dorn  - 
      Dorn is a local doctor who was once a popular and handsome ladies' man. Dorn often provides an outsider's perspective to the play for he functions almost as an audience member on stage. He is less vital to the desires and distresses on stage, but he is important as a fluid observer and commentator, confidant, and witness to the events. He has known Arkadina, Sorin, and the rest for many years. Dorn has affections for Paulina but does not seem to be in love with her. Like Sorin, Dorn is a compassionate presence who respects Treplev's talent and attempts to soften the blow of Arkadina's ego on her depressed son, Treplev's, spirit.
