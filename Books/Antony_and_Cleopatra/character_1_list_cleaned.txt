[CHARACTER] - 
                	the
queen of egypt and antony's lover. a highly attractive woman who
once seduced julius caesar, [CHARACTER] delights in the thought that
she has caught antony like a fish. in matters of love, as in all
things, [CHARACTER] favors high drama: her emotions are as volatile
as they are theatrical, and, regardless of whether her audience
is her handmaid or the emperor of rome, she always offers a top-notch
performance. although she tends to make a spectacle of her emotions,
one cannot doubt the genuine nature of her love for antony. shakespeare
makes clear that the queen does love the general,
even if her loyalty is sometimes misplaced.
