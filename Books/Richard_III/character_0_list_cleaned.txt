[CHARACTER] - 
                	also
called the duke of gloucester, and eventually crowned king [CHARACTER]
iii. deformed in body and twisted in mind, [CHARACTER] is both the central
character and the villain of the play. he is evil, corrupt, sadistic, and
manipulative, and he will stop at nothing to become king. his intelligence,
political brilliance, and dazzling use of language keep the audience fascinated--and
his subjects and rivals under his thumb.
