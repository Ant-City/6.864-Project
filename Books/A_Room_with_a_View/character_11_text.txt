ts, her heart refused to despise it entirely. nor did he realize
a more important point--that if she was too great for this society, she
was too great for all society, and had reached the stage where personal
intercourse would alone satisfy her. a rebel she was, but not of the
kind he understood--a rebel who desired, not a wider dwelling-room, but
equality beside the man she loved. for italy was offering her the most
priceless of all possessions--her own soul.

playing bumble-puppy with minnie beebe, niece to the rector, and
aged thirteen--an ancient and most honourable game, which consists in
striking tennis-balls high into the air, so that they fall over the net
and immoderately bounce; some hit mrs. honeychurch; others are lost. the
sentence is confused, but the better illustrates lucy’s state of mind,
for she was trying to talk to mr. beebe at the same time.

“oh, it has been such a nuisance--first he, then they--no one knowing
what they wanted, and everyone so tireso

are coming. i heard from them this morning.

“i shall hate those miss alans!” mrs. honeychurch cried. “just because
they’re old and silly one’s expected to say ‘how sweet!’ i hate
their ‘if’-ing and ‘but’-ing and ‘and’-ing. and poor lucy--serve her
right--worn to a shadow.”

mr. beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the
tennis-court. cecil was absent--one did not play bumble-puppy when he
was there.

“well, if they are coming--no, minnie, not saturn.” saturn was a
tennis-ball whose skin was partially unsewn. when in motion his orb was
encircled by a ring. “if they are coming, sir harry will let them move
in before the twenty-ninth, and he will cross out the clause about
whitewashing the ceilings, because it made them nervous, and put in the
fair wear and tear one.--that doesn’t count. i told you not saturn.”

“saturn’s all right for bumble-puppy,” cried freddy, joining them.
“minnie, don’t you listen t

o her.”

“saturn doesn’t bounce.”

“saturn bounces enough.”

“no, he doesn’t.”

“well; he bounces better than the beautiful white devil.”

“hush, dear,” said mrs. honeychurch.

“but look at lucy--complaining of saturn, and all the time’s got the
beautiful white devil in her hand, ready to plug it in. that’s right,
minnie, go for her--get her over the shins with the racquet--get her
over the shins!”

lucy fell, the beautiful white devil rolled from her hand.

mr. beebe picked it up, and said: “the name of this ball is vittoria
corombona, please.” but his correction passed unheeded.

freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls
to fury, and in half a minute he had transformed minnie from a
well-mannered child into a howling wilderness. up in the house cecil
heard them, and,

come down to impart it, in case he got hurt. he was not a coward and
bore necessary pain as well as any man. but he hated the physical
violence of the young. how right it was! sure enough it ended in a cry.

“i wish the miss alans could see this,” observed mr. beebe, just as
lucy, who was nursing the injured minnie, was in turn lifted off her
feet by her brother.

“who are the miss alans?” freddy panted.

“they have taken cissie villa.”

“that wasn’t the name--”

it was more than her nerves could stand. and she could not protest
violently after her mother’s goodness to her upstairs.

“mother, no!” she pleaded. “it’s impossible. we can’t have charlotte on
the top of the other things; we’re squeezed to death as it is. freddy’s
got a friend coming tuesday, there’s cecil, and you’ve promised to take
in minnie beebe because of the diphtheria scare. it simply can’t be
done.”

“nonsense! it can.”

“if minnie sleeps in the bath. not otherwise.”

“minnie can sleep with you.”

“i won’t have her.”

“then, if you’re so selfish, mr. floyd must share a room with freddy.”

“miss bartlett, miss bartlett, miss bartlett,” moaned cecil, again
laying his hand over his eyes.

“it’s impossible,” repeated lucy. “i don’t want to make difficulties,

nd she entertained an image that had physical beauty. in spite of the
clearest directions, miss bartlett contrived to bungle her arrival.
she was due at the south-eastern station at dorking, whither mrs.
honeychurch drove to meet her. she arrived at the london and brighton
station, and had to hire a cab up. no one was at home except freddy
and his friend, who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for
a solid hour. cecil and lucy turned up at four o’clock, and these, with
little minnie beebe, made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper
lawn for tea.

“i shall never forgive myself,” said miss bartlett, who kept on rising
from her seat, and had to be begged by the united company to remain.
“i have upset everything. bursting in on young people! but i insist on
paying for my cab up. grant that, at any rate.”

“our visitors never do such dreadful things,” said lucy, while her
brother, in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown unsubstantial,

shall avoid this deplorable gambling.”

miss bartlett, who was poor at figures, became bewildered and rendered
up the sovereign, amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths. for
a moment cecil was happy. he was playing at nonsense among his peers.
then he glanced at lucy, in whose face petty anxieties had marred the
smiles. in january he would rescue his leonardo from this stupefying
twaddle.

“but i don’t see that!” exclaimed minnie beebe who had narrowly watched
the iniquitous transaction. “i don’t see why mr. vyse is to have the
quid.”

“because of the fifteen shillings and the five,” they said solemnly.
“fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound, you see.”

“but i don’t see--”

they tried to stifle her with cake.

“no, thank you. i’m done. i don’t see why--freddy, don’t poke me. miss

what would you have me do? first you say ‘don’t tell’; and then you say,
‘tell’. which is it to be? quick!”

miss bartlett sighed “i am no match for you in conversation, dearest. i
blush when i think how i interfered at florence, and you so well able
to look after yourself, and so much cleverer in all ways than i am. you
will never forgive me.”

“shall we go out, then. they will smash all the china if we don’t.”

for the air rang with the shrieks of minnie, who was being scalped with
a teaspoon.

“dear, one moment--we may not have this chance for a chat again. have
you seen the young one yet?”

“yes, i have.”

“what happened?”

“we met at the rectory.”

“what line is he taking up?”

“no line. he talked about italy, like any other person. it is really all

ech-trees with russet, the oak-trees with gold. up on the
heights, battalions of black pines witnessed the change, themselves
unchangeable. either country was spanned by a cloudless sky, and in
either arose the tinkle of church bells.

the garden of windy corners was deserted except for a red book, which
lay sunning itself upon the gravel path. from the house came incoherent
sounds, as of females preparing for worship. “the men say they won’t
go”--“well, i don’t blame them”--minnie says, “need she go?”--“tell
her, no nonsense”--“anne! mary! hook me behind!”--“dearest lucia, may i
trespass upon you for a pin?” for miss bartlett had announced that she
at all events was one for church.

the sun rose higher on its journey, guided, not by phaethon, but by
apollo, competent, unswerving, divine. its rays fell on the ladies
whenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows; on mr. beebe down
at summer street as he smiled over a letter from miss catharine

how little she knew, and even when she thought she knew a thing, like
the italian painters, she found she had forgotten it. only this morning
she had confused francesco francia with piero della francesca, and cecil
had said, “what! you aren’t forgetting your italy already?” and this too
had lent anxiety to her eyes when she saluted the dear view and the
dear garden in the foreground, and above them, scarcely conceivable
elsewhere, the dear sun.

“lucy--have you a sixpence for minnie and a shilling for yourself?”

she hastened in to her mother, who was rapidly working herself into a
sunday fluster.

“it’s a special collection--i forget what for. i do beg, no vulgar
clinking in the plate with halfpennies; see that minnie has a nice
bright sixpence. where is the child? minnie! that book’s all warped.
(gracious, how plain you look!) put it under the atlas to press.

“oh, mrs. honeychurch--” from the upper regions.

poor charlotte--how i do detest blouses! minnie!”

paganism is infectious--more infectious than diphtheria or piety--and
the rector’s niece was taken to church protesting. as usual, she didn’t
see why. why shouldn’t she sit in the sun with the young men? the
young men, who had now appeared, mocked her with ungenerous words. mrs.
honeychurch defended orthodoxy, and in the midst of the confusion miss
bartlett, dressed in the very height of the fashion, came strolling down
the stairs.

and son smoking in the garden.

“introduce me,” said her mother. “unless the young man considers that he
knows me already.”

he probably did; but lucy ignored the sacred lake and introduced them
formally. old mr. emerson claimed her with much warmth, and said how
glad he was that she was going to be married. she said yes, she was glad
too; and then, as miss bartlett and minnie were lingering behind with
mr. beebe, she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic, and
asked him how he liked his new house.

“very much,” he replied, but there was a note of offence in his voice;
she had never known him offended before. he added: “we find, though,
that the miss alans were coming, and that we have turned them out. women
mind such a thing. i am very much upset about it.”

“i believe that there was some misunderstanding,” said mrs. honeychurch

never realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to make
up a fourth.

“oh, come along cecil. i’m bad, floyd’s rotten, and so i dare say’s
emerson.”

george corrected him: “i am not bad.”

one looked down one’s nose at this. “then certainly i won’t play,” said
cecil, while miss bartlett, under the impression that she was snubbing
george, added: “i agree with you, mr. vyse. you had much better not
play. much better not.”

minnie, rushing in where cecil feared to tread, announced that she would
play. “i shall miss every ball anyway, so what does it matter?” but
sunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion.

“then it will have to be lucy,” said mrs. honeychurch; “you must fall
back on lucy. there is no other way out of it. lucy, go and change your
frock.”

lucy’s sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature. she kept it
without hypocrisy in the morning, and broke it without r

late last night. i must go.”

“perhaps they won’t want me down there.”

“no--go on. good-bye.”

“thank goodness!” exclaimed mr. beebe to himself, and struck the saddle
of his bicycle approvingly, “it was the one foolish thing she ever
did. oh, what a glorious riddance!” and, after a little thought, he
negotiated the slope into windy corner, light of heart. the house was
again as it ought to be--cut off forever from cecil’s pretentious world.

he would find miss minnie down in the garden.

in the drawing-room lucy was tinkling at a mozart sonata. he hesitated a
moment, but went down the garden as requested. there he found a mournful
company. it was a blustering day, and the wind had taken and broken the
dahlias. mrs. honeychurch, who looked cross, was tying them up,
while miss bartlett, unsuitably dressed, impeded her with offers of
assistance. at a little distance stood minnie and the “garden-child,” a
minute importation, each holding either end

having to go out, when i had counted on having powell, who--give every
one their due--does tie up dahlias properly.”

evidently mrs. honeychurch was shattered.

“how do you do?” said miss bartlett, with a meaning glance, as though
conveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn
gales.

“here, lennie, the bass,” cried mrs. honeychurch. the garden-child, who
did not know what bass was, stood rooted to the path with horror. minnie
slipped to her uncle and whispered that everyone was very disagreeable
to-day, and that it was not her fault if dahlia-strings would tear
longways instead of across.

“come for a walk with me,” he told her. “you have worried them as much
as they can stand. mrs. honeychurch, i only called in aimlessly. i shall
take her up to tea at the beehive tavern, if i may.”

“oh, must you? yes do.--not the scissors, thank you, charlotte, when
both my hands are full already--i’m perfect

ly certain that the orange
cactus will go before i can get to it.”

mr. beebe, who was an adept at relieving situations, invited miss
bartlett to accompany them to this mild festivity.

“yes, charlotte, i don’t want you--do go; there’s nothing to stop about
for, either in the house or out of it.”

miss bartlett said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed, but when she had
exasperated everyone, except minnie, by a refusal, she turned round and
exasperated minnie by an acceptance. as they walked up the garden, the
orange cactus fell, and mr. beebe’s last vision was of the garden-child
clasping it like a lover, his dark head buried in a wealth of blossom.

“it is terrible, this havoc among the flowers,” he remarked.

“it is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a
moment,” enunciated miss bartlett.

“perhaps we ought to send miss honeychurch down to her mother. or will
she come with us?”

“i think we had be

tter leave lucy to herself, and to her own pursuits.”

“they’re angry with miss honeychurch because she was late for
breakfast,” whispered minnie, “and floyd has gone, and mr. vyse has
gone, and freddy won’t play with me. in fact, uncle arthur, the house is
not at all what it was yesterday.”

“don’t be a prig,” said her uncle arthur. “go and put on your boots.”

he stepped into the drawing-room, where lucy was still attentively
pursuing the sonatas of mozart. she stopped when he entered.

“how do you do? miss bartlett and minnie are coming with me to tea at
the beehive. would you come too?”

“i don’t t

ling.

mrs. honeychurch, who hated all changes, did mind, but not nearly as
much as her daughter pretended, and only for the minute. it was really
a ruse of lucy’s to justify her despondency--a ruse of which she was not
herself conscious, for she was marching in the armies of darkness.

“and freddy minds.”

“still, freddy never hit it off with vyse much, did he? i gathered that
he disliked the engagement, and felt it might separate him from you.”

“boys are so odd.”

minnie could be heard arguing with miss bartlett through the floor. tea
at the beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel. mr.
beebe saw that lucy--very properly--did not wish to discuss her action,
so after a sincere expression of sympathy, he said, “i have had an
absurd letter from miss alan. that was really what brought me over. i
thought it might amuse you all.”

“how delightful!” said lucy, in a dull voice.

for the sake of something to do, he began to read her the

 to be. i know all about it. the
marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she
could wind herself up to speak.”

miss bartlett gave a kind of wriggle, and he prepared for a discussion.
he had never fathomed miss bartlett. as he had put it to himself
at florence, “she might yet reveal depths of strangeness, if not of
meaning.” but she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable. he
assumed that much, and he had no hesitation in discussing lucy with her.
minnie was fortunately collecting ferns.

she opened the discussion with: “we had much better let the matter
drop.”

“i wonder.”

“it is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in
summer street. it would be death to gossip about mr. vyse’s dismissal at
the present moment.”

mr. beebe raised his eyebrows. death is a strong word--surely too
strong. there was no question of tragedy. he said: “of course, miss
honeychurch will make the fact public in her own wa

s, and, changing the subject again, he said: “we shan’t have
rain, but we shall have darkness, so let us hurry on. the darkness last
night was appalling.”

they reached the beehive tavern at about five o’clock. that amiable
hostelry possesses a verandah, in which the young and the unwise do
dearly love to sit, while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant
sanded room, and have tea at a table comfortably. mr. beebe saw that
miss bartlett would be cold if she sat out, and that minnie would be
dull if she sat in, so he proposed a division of forces. they would hand
the child her food through the window. thus he was incidentally enabled
to discuss the fortunes of lucy.

“i have been thinking, miss bartlett,” he said, “and, unless you
very much object, i would like to reopen that discussion.” she bowed.
“nothing about the past. i know little and care less about that; i am
absolutely certain that it is to your cousin’s credit. she has acted
loftily and righ

here, apparently, was one of those points that the male intellect
misses. mr. beebe exclaimed: “so she says herself, and since another
lady agrees with her, i must own that i am partially convinced. perhaps
she must have a change. i have no sisters or--and i don’t understand
these things. but why need she go as far as greece?”

“you may well ask that,” replied miss bartlett, who was evidently
interested, and had almost dropped her evasive manner. “why greece?
(what is it, minnie dear--jam?) why not tunbridge wells? oh, mr. beebe!
i had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear lucy this
morning. i cannot help her. i will say no more. perhaps i have already
said too much. i am not to talk. i wanted her to spend six months with
me at tunbridge wells, and she refused.”

mr. beebe poked at a crumb with his knife.

“but my feelings are of no importance. i know too well that i get on
lucy’s nerves. our tour was a failure. she wanted to leave florence,
