gue dread had hung on his sky-line. it was formed of zeena’s obstinate silence, of mattie’s sudden look of warning, of the memory of just such fleeting imperceptible signs as those which told him, on certain stainless mornings, that before night there would be rain.
his dread was so strong that, man-like, he sought to postpone certainty. the hauling was not over till mid-day, and as the lumber was to be delivered to andrew hale, the starkfield builder, it was really easier for ethan to send jotham powell, the hired man, back to the farm on foot, and drive the load down to the village himself. he had scrambled up on the logs, and was sitting astride of them, close over his shaggy grays, when, coming between him and their streaming necks, he had a vision of the warning look that mattie had given him the night before.
“if there’s going to be any trouble i want to be there,” was his vague reflection, as he threw to jotham the unexpected order to unhitch the team and lead them back to the barn

 which she had never been able to learn the use. but for the moment his sense of relief was so great as to preclude all other feelings. he had now no doubt that zeena had spoken the truth in saying, the night before, that she had sat up because she felt “too mean” to sleep: her abrupt resolve to seek medical advice showed that, as usual, she was wholly absorbed in her health.
as if expecting a protest, she continued plaintively; “if you’re too busy with the hauling i presume you can let jotham powell drive me over with the sorrel in time to ketch the train at the flats.”
her husband hardly heard what she was saying. during the winter months there was no stage between starkfield and bettsbridge, and the trains which stopped at corbury flats were slow and infrequent. a rapid calculation showed ethan that zeena could not be back at the farm before the following evening....
“if i’d supposed you’d ‘a’ made any objection to jotham powell’s driving me over—” she began again, as t

 nose to the corners of her mouth. though she was but seven years her husband’s senior, and he was only twenty-eight, she was already an old woman.
ethan tried to say something befitting the occasion, but there was only one thought in his mind: the fact that, for the first time since mattie had come to live with them, zeena was to be away for a night. he wondered if the girl were thinking of it too....
he knew that zeena must be wondering why he did not offer to drive her to the flats and let jotham powell take the lumber to starkfield, and at first he could not think of a pretext for not doing so; then he said: “i’d take you over myself, only i’ve got to collect the cash for the lumber.”
as soon as the words were spoken he regretted them, not only because they were untrue—there being no prospect of his receiving cash payment from hale—but also because he knew from experience the imprudence of letting zeena think he was in funds on the eve of one of her therapeutic excursions. at the

er you,” she cried, the laughter sparkling through her lashes.
again ethan felt a sudden twinge of jealousy. could it be his coming that gave her such a kindled face?
“well, matt, any visitors?” he threw off, stooping down carelessly to examine the fastening of the stove.
she nodded and laughed “yes, one,” and he felt a blackness settling on his brows.
“who was that?” he questioned, raising himself up to slant a glance at her beneath his scowl.
her eyes danced with malice. “why, jotham powell. he came in after he got back, and asked for a drop of coffee before he went down home.”
the blackness lifted and light flooded ethan’s brain. “that all? well, i hope you made out to let him have it.” and after a pause he felt it right to add: “i suppose he got zeena over to the flats all right?”
“oh, yes; in plenty of time.”
the name threw a chill between them, and they stood a moment looking sideways at each other before mattie said with a shy laugh. “i guess it’s about ti

ethan put the candlestick in mattie’s hand and she went out of the kitchen ahead of him, the light that she carried before her making her dark hair look like a drift of mist on the moon.
“good night, matt,” he said as she put her foot on the first step of the stairs.
she turned and looked at him a moment. “good night, ethan,” she answered, and went up.
when the door of her room had closed on her he remembered that he had not even touched her hand.

the next morning at breakfast jotham powell was between them, and ethan tried to hide his joy under an air of exaggerated indifference, lounging back in his chair to throw scraps to the cat, growling at the weather, and not so much as offering to help mattie when she rose to clear away the dishes.
he did not know why he was so irrationally happy, for nothing was changed in his life or hers. he had not even touched the tip of her fingers or looked her full in the eyes. but their evening together had given him a vision of what life at her

side might be, and he was glad now that he had done nothing to trouble the sweetness of the picture. he had a fancy that she knew what had restrained him...
there was a last load of lumber to be hauled to the village, and jotham powell—who did not work regularly for ethan in winter—had “come round” to help with the job. but a wet snow, melting to sleet, had fallen in the night and turned the roads to glass. there was more wet in the air and it seemed likely to both men that the weather would “milden” toward afternoon and make the going safer. ethan therefore proposed to his assistant that they should load the sledge at the wood-lot, as they had done on the previous morning, and put off the “teaming” to starkfi

d finished his dinner he might get back to the farm with the glue before jotham and the old sorrel had had time to fetch zenobia from the flats; but he knew the chance was a slight one. it turned on the state of the roads and on the possible lateness of the bettsbridge train. he remembered afterward, with a grim flash of self-derision, what importance he had attached to the weighing of these probabilities...
as soon as dinner was over he set out again for the wood-lot, not daring to linger till jotham powell left. the hired man was still drying his wet feet at the stove, and ethan could only give mattie a quick look as he said beneath his breath: “i’ll be back early.”
he fancied that she nodded her comprehension; and with that scant solace he had to trudge off through the rain.
he had driven his load half-way to the village when jotham powell overtook him, urging the reluctant sorrel toward the flats. “i’ll have to hurry up to do it,” ethan mused, as the sleigh dropped down ahead of him

 bending over a pan on the stove; but at the sound of his step she turned with a start and sprang to him.
“see, here, matt, i’ve got some stuff to mend the dish with! let me get at it quick,” he cried, waving the bottle in one hand while he put her lightly aside; but she did not seem to hear him.
“oh, ethan—zeena’s come,” she said in a whisper, clutching his sleeve.
they stood and stared at each other, pale as culprits.
“but the sorrel’s not in the barn!” ethan stammered.
“jotham powell brought some goods over from the flats for his wife, and he drove right on home with them,” she explained.
he gazed blankly about the kitchen, which looked cold and squalid in the rainy winter twilight.
“how is she?” he asked, dropping his voice to mattie’s whisper.
she looked away from him uncertainly. “i don’t know. she went right up to her room.”
“she didn’t say anything?”
“no.”
ethan let out his doubts in a low whistle and thrust the bottle back into his pocket. “d

on’t fret; i’ll come down and mend it in the night,” he said. he pulled on his wet coat again and went back to the barn to feed the greys.
while he was there jotham powell drove up with the sleigh, and when the horses had been attended to ethan said to him: “you might as well come back up for a bite.” he was not sorry to assure himself of jotham’s neutralising presence at the supper table, for zeena was always “nervous” after a journey. but the hired man, though seldom loth to accept a meal not included in his wages, opened his stiff jaws to answer slowly: “i’m obliged to you, but i guess i’ll go along back.”
ethan looked at him in surprise. “

i don’t want you should trouble either,” he said, looking down into her eyes with a smile.
she flushed up warmly and whispered back: “no, ethan, i ain’t going to trouble.”
“i guess things’ll straighten out,” he added.
there was no answer but a quick throb of her lids, and he went on: “she ain’t said anything this morning?”
“no. i haven’t seen her yet.”
“don’t you take any notice when you do.”
with this injunction he left her and went out to the cow-barn. he saw jotham powell walking up the hill through the morning mist, and the familiar sight added to his growing conviction of security.
as the two men were clearing out the stalls jotham rested on his pitch-fork to say: “dan’l byrne’s goin’ over to the flats to-day noon, an’ he c’d take mattie’s trunk along, and make it easier ridin’ when i take her over in the sleigh.”
ethan looked at him blankly, and he continued: “mis’ frome said the new girl’d be at the flats at five, and i was to take ma

an went into the kitchen and found his wife by the stove. her head was wrapped in her shawl, and she was reading a book called “kidney troubles and their cure” on which he had had to pay extra postage only a few days before.
zeena did not move or look up when he entered, and after a moment he asked: “where’s mattie?”
without lifting her eyes from the page she replied: “i presume she’s getting down her trunk.”
the blood rushed to his face. “getting down her trunk—alone?”
“jotham powell’s down in the wood-lot, and dan’l byrne says he darsn’t leave that horse,” she returned.
her husband, without stopping to hear the end of the phrase, had left the kitchen and sprung up the stairs. the door of mattie’s room was shut, and he wavered a moment on the landing. “matt,” he said in a low voice; but there was no answer, and he put his hand on the door-knob.
he had never been in her room except once, in the early summer, when he had gone there to plaster up a leak in the ea

“i’m going to drive you over, matt,” he whispered.
she murmured back: “i think zeena wants i should go with jotham.”
“i’m going to drive you over,” he repeated; and she went into the kitchen without answering.
at dinner ethan could not eat. if he lifted his eyes they rested on zeena’s pinched face, and the corners of her straight lips seemed to quiver away into a smile. she ate well, declaring that the mild weather made her feel better, and pressed a second helping of beans on jotham powell, whose wants she generally ignored.
mattie, when the meal was over, went about her usual task of clearing the table and washing up the dishes. zeena, after feeding the cat, had returned to her rocking-chair by the stove, and jotham powell, who always lingered last, reluctantly pushed back his chair and moved toward the door.
on the threshold he turned back to say to ethan: “what time’ll i come round for mattie?”
ethan was standing near the window, mechanically filling his pipe while he wa

it ain’t been drawing right for nigh on a month now.”
ethan’s voice rose indignantly. “if it was good enough for mattie i guess it’s good enough for a hired girl.”
“that girl that’s coming told me she was used to a house where they had a furnace,” zeena persisted with the same monotonous mildness.
“she’d better ha’ stayed there then,” he flung back at her; and turning to mattie he added in a hard voice: “you be ready by three, matt; i’ve got business at corbury.”
jotham powell had started for the barn, and ethan strode down after him aflame with anger. the pulses in his temples throbbed and a fog was in his eyes. he went about his task without knowing what force directed him, or whose hands and feet were fulfilling its orders. it was not till he led out the sorrel and backed him between the shafts of the sleigh that he once more became conscious of what he was doing. as he passed the bridle over the horse’s head, and wound the traces around the shafts, he remembere
