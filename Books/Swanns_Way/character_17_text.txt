still on the spot, before that steeple, for hours on end, motionless,
trying to remember, feeling deep within myself a tract of soil reclaimed
from the waters of lethe slowly drying until the buildings rise on it
again; and then no doubt, and then more uneasily than when, just now,
i asked him for a direction, i will seek my way again, i will turn a
corner... but... the goal is in my heart...

on our way home from mass we would often meet m. legrandin, who,
detained in paris by his professional duties as an engineer, could
only (except in the regular holiday seasons) visit his home at combray
between saturday evenings and monday mornings. he was one of that class
of men who, apart from a scientific career in which they may well have
proved brilliantly successful, have acquired an entirely different
kind of culture, literary or artistic, of which they make no use in the
specialised work of their profession, but by which their conversation

fits. more 'literary' than many 'men of letters' (we were not aware
at this period that m. legrandin had a distinct reputation as a writer,
and so were greatly astonished to find that a well-known composer
had set some verses of his to music), endowed with a greater ease
in execution than many painters, they imagine that the life they are
obliged to lead is not that for which they are really fitted, and they
bring to their regular occupations either a fantastic indifference or
a sustained and lofty application, scornful, bitter, and conscientious.

tonished, too, at
the furious invective which he was always launching at the aristocracy,
at fashionable life, and 'snobbishness'--"undoubtedly," he would say,
"the sin of which saint paul is thinking when he speaks of the sin for
which there is no forgiveness."

worldly ambition was a thing which my grandmother was so little capable
of feeling, or indeed of understanding, that it seemed to her futile to
apply so much heat to its condemnation. besides, she thought it in not
very good taste that m. legrandin, whose sister was married to a country
gentleman of lower normandy near balbec, should deliver himself of such
violent attacks upon the nobles, going so far as to blame the revolution
for not having guillotined them all.

"well met, my friends!" he would say as he came towards us. "you are
lucky to spend so much time here; to-morrow i have to go back to paris,
to squeeze back into my niche.

"oh, i admit," he went on, with his own peculiar smile, gently ironical,
disillusioned and vague, "i hav

so, when i had found, one day, in a book by bergotte, some joke about
an old family servant, to which his solemn and magnificent style added a
great deal of irony, but which was in principle what i had often said to
my grandmother about françoise, and when, another time, i had discovered
that he thought not unworthy of reflection in one of those mirrors of
absolute truth which were his writings, a remark similar to one which i
had had occasion to make on our friend m. legrandin (and, moreover, my
remarks on françoise and m. legrandin were among those which i would
most resolutely have sacrificed for bergotte's sake, in the belief
that he would find them quite without interest); then it was suddenly
revealed to me that my own humble existence and the realms of truth were
less widely separated than i had supposed, that at certain points they
were actually in contact; and in my new-found confidence and joy i wept
upon his printed page, as in the arms of a long-lost fath

 it from the assaults of strangers with
a maternal ferocity. she would, however, have seen no great harm in what
my aunt, whom she knew to be incurably generous, allowed herself to give
away, had she given only to those who were already rich. perhaps
she felt that such persons, not being actually in need of my aunt's
presents, could not be suspected of simulating affection for her on
that account. besides, presents offered to persons of great wealth and
position, such as mme. sazerat, m. swann, m. legrandin and mme. goupil,
to persons of the 'same class' as my aunt, and who would naturally
'mix with her,' seemed to françoise to be included among the ornamental
customs of that strange and brilliant life led by rich people, who
hunted and shot, gave balls and paid visits, a life which she would
contemplate with an admiring smile. but it was by no means the same
thing if, for this princely exchange of courtesies, my aunt substituted
mere charity, if her beneficiaries were of the class which françoi

and my great-aunt interrupted with: "too many good things..." for, since
her daughter's illness, she felt herself in duty bound to revive her as
far as possible by always drawing her attention to the brighter side of
things. but my father had begun to speak.

"i should like to take advantage," he said, "of the whole family's being
here together, to tell you a story, so as not to have to begin all over
again to each of you separately. i am afraid we are in m. legrandin's
bad books; he would hardly say 'how d'ye do' to me this morning."

i did not wait to hear the end of my father's story, for i had been with
him myself after mass when we had passed m. legrandin; instead, i went
downstairs to the kitchen to ask for the bill of fare for our dinner,
which was of fresh interest to me daily, like the news in a paper, and
excited me as might the programme of a coming festivity.

as m. legrandin had passed close by us on our way from church,
walking by the side of a

to her permanent and unfaltering resolution to render the house
uninhabitable to any other servant, a series of crafty and pitiless
stratagems. many years later we discovered that, if we had been fed on
asparagus day after day throughout that whole season, it was because the
smell of the plants gave the poor kitchen-maid, who had to prepare them,
such violent attacks of asthma that she was finally obliged to leave my
aunt's service.

alas! we had definitely to alter our opinion of m. legrandin. on one
of the sundays following our meeting with him on the pont-vieux, after
which my father had been forced to confess himself mistaken, as mass
drew to an end, and, with the sunshine and the noise of the outer world,
something else invaded the church, an atmosphere so far from sacred that

spring breeze, still cooled by the last frosts of winter, wafting apart,
for the two butterflies' sake, that have waited outside all morning, the
closed portals of the first jerusalem rose."

the question was raised at home whether, all things considered, i ought
still to be sent to dine with m. legrandin. but my grandmother refused
to believe that he could have been impolite.

"you admit yourself that he appears at church there, quite simply
dressed, and all that; he hardly looks like a man of fashion." she added
that; in any event, even if, at the worst, he had been intentionally
rude, it was far better for us to pretend that we had noticed nothing.
and indeed my father himself, though more annoyed than any of us by the
attitude which legrandin had adopted, may still have held in reserve a

the moonlight breathes through the flute of silence."

i could hear what m. legrandin was saying; like everything that he said,
it sounded attractive; but i was disturbed by the memory of a lady whom
i had seen recently for the first time; and thinking, now that i
knew that legrandin was on friendly terms with several of the local
aristocracy, that perhaps she also was among his acquaintance, i
summoned up all my courage and said to him: "tell me, sir, do you, by
any chance, know the lady--the ladies of guermantes?" and i felt glad

dominant, despotic legrandin, if he lacked our
legrandin's charming vocabulary, shewed an infinitely greater promptness
in expressing himself, by means of what are called 'reflexes,' it
followed that, when legrandin the talker attempted to silence him, he
would already have spoken, and it would be useless for our friend to
deplore the bad impression which the revelations of his _alter ego_ must
have caused, since he could do no more now than endeavour to mitigate
them.

this was not to say that m. legrandin was anything but sincere when he
inveighed against snobs. he could not (from his own knowledge, at least)
be aware that he was one also, since it is only with the passions of
others that we are ever really familiar, and what we come to find out
about our own can be no more than what other people have shewn us. upon
ourselves they react but indirectly, through our imagination, which
substitutes for our actual, primary motives other, secondary motives,
less stark and therefore more decent. never

he graces. he would be drawn towards the
duchess, assuring himself the while that he was yielding to the
attractions of her mind, and her other virtues, which the vile race of
snobs could never understand. only his fellow-snobs knew that he was
of their number, for, owing to their inability to appreciate the
intervening efforts of his imagination, they saw in close juxtaposition
the social activities of legrandin and their primary cause.

at home, meanwhile, we had no longer any illusions as to m. legrandin,
and our relations with him had become much more distant. mamma would be
greatly delighted whenever she caught him red-handed in the sin, which
he continued to call the unpardonable sin, of snobbery. as for my
father, he found it difficult to take legrandin's airs in so light, in
so detached a spirit; and when there was some talk, one year, of sending
me to spend the long summer holidays at balbec with my grandmother,
he said: "i must, most certainly, tell legrandin that you are going to

umed the consultation: "no balbec before you are fifty!"
he called out to me, "and even then it must depend on the state of the
heart."

my father spoke to him of it again, as often as we met him, and tortured
him with questions, but it was labour in vain: like that scholarly
swindler who devoted to the fabrication of forged palimpsests a wealth
of skill and knowledge and industry the hundredth part of which would
have sufficed to establish him in a more lucrative--but an honourable
occupation, m. legrandin, had we insisted further, would in the end have
constructed a whole system of ethics, and a celestial geography of lower
normandy, sooner than admit to us that, within a mile of balbec, his own
sister was living in her own house; sooner than find himself obliged
to offer us a letter of introduction, the prospect of which would never
have inspired him with such terror had he been absolutely certain--as,
from his knowledge of my grandmother's character, he really ought to
have been certain--that
