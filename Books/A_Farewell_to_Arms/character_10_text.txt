. i remembered it as a little white town 
with a campanile in a valley. it was a clean little town 
and there was a fine fountain in the square. 

"they are working from there. there are many sick 
now. the fighting is over." 

"where are the others?" 

"there are two up in the mountains and four still 
on the bainsizza. the other two ambulance sections 
are in the carso with the third army." 

"what do you wish me to do?" 

"you can go and take over the four cars on the 
bainsizza if you like. gino has been up there a long 
time. you haven't seen it up there, have you?" 

"no." 

"it was very bad. we lost three cars." 

"i heard about it." 

"yes, rinaldi wrote you."

"where is rinaldi?" 

"he is here at the hospital. he has had a summer 
and fall of it" 

"i believe it." 

"it has been bad," the major said. "you couldn't 
believe how bad it's been. i've often thought you were 
lucky to be hit when you were." 

"i know i was."

but i can't believe it. it is too late. you saw the 
river?" 

"yes. it's high already." 

"i don't believe they will attack now that the rains 
have started. we will have the snow soon. what 
about your countrymen? will there be other ameri- 
cans besides yourself?" 

"they are training an army of ten million." 

"i hope we get some of them. but the french will 
hog them all. we'll never get any down here. all 
right. you stay here to-night and go out to-morrow 
with the little car and send gino back. i'll send some- 
body with you that knows the road. gino will tell you 
everything. they are shelling quite a little still but it 
is all over. you will want to see the bainsizza." 

"i'm glad to see it. i am glad to be back with you 
again, signor maggiore." 

he smiled. "you are very good to say so. i am 
very tired of this war* if i was away i do not believe 
i would come back." 

"is it so bad?" 

"yes. it is so bad and worse. go get cleaned up 
and find your friend rinaldi."

he is treating himself for it. good-night. you will 
leave before daylight, enrico ?" 

"yes." 

"good-by then," he said. "good luck. peduzzi will 
wake you and go with you." 

"good-by, signor maggiore." 

"good-by. they talk about an austrian offensive 
but i don't believe it. i hope not. but anyway it won't 
be here. gino will tell you everything. the telephone 
works well now." 

'til call regularly." 

"please do. good-night. don't let rinaldi drink so 
much brandy." 

"i'll try not to." 

"good-night, priest." 

"good-night, signor maggiore." 

he went off into his office.

i went to the door and looked out. it had stopped 
raining but there was a mist. 

"should we go upstairs ?" i asked the priest. 

"i can only stay a little while." 

"come on up." 

we climbed the stairs and went into my

new road and many trucks. beyond, 
the road flattened out and i saw woods and steep hills 
in the mist. there were woods that had been taken 
quickly and not smashed. then beyond where the road 
was not protected by the hills it was screened by mat- 
ting on the sides and over the top. the road ended in 
a wrecked village. the lines were up beyond. there 
was much artillery around. the houses were badly 
smashed but things were very well organized and there 
were signboards everywhere. we found gino and he 
got us some coffee and later i went with him and met 
various people and saw the posts. gino said the brit- 
ish cars were working further down the bainsizza at 
ravne. he had great admiration for the british. there 
was still a certain amount of shelling, he said, but not 
many wounded. there would be many sick now the 
rains had started. the austrians were supposed to at- 
tack but he did not believe it. we were supposed to at- 
tack too, but they had not brought up any new troops

ve us, and shelled the roads badly at night. 
there was a battery of naval guns that had gotten on 
his nerves. i would recognize them because of their 
flat trajectory. you heard the report and then the 
shriek commenced almost instantly. they usually fired 
two guns at once, one right after the other, and the 
fragments from the burst were enormous. he showed 
me one, a smoothly jagged piece of metal over a foot 
long. it looked like babbiting metal. 

"i don't suppose they are so effective," gino said. 
"but they scare me. they all sound as though they 
came directly for you. there is the boom, then in- 
stantly the shriek and burst. what's the use of not be- 
ing wounded if they scare you to death?" 

he said there were croats in the lines opposite us 
now and some magyars. our troops were still in the 
attacking positions. there was no wire to speak of and 
no place to fall back to if there should be an austrian 
attack. there were fine positions for defense along the 
low mountains t

fense. what did i think about the bainsizza anyway? 

i had expected it to be flatter, more like a plateau. 
i had not realized it was so broken up. 

"alto piano," gino said, "but no piano." 

we went back to the cellar of the house where he 
lived. i said i thought a ridge that flattened out on 
top and had a little depth would be easier and more 
practical to hold than a succession of small mountains. 
it was no harder to attack up a mountain than on the 
level, i argued. "that depends on the mountains," he 
said. "look at san gabriele." 

"yes," i said, "but where they had trouble was at 
the top where it was flat. they got up to the top easy 
enough."

 i said. 
you pinched off one mountain and they pinched off an- 
other but when something really started every one had 
to get down off the mountains. 

what were you going to do if you had a mountain 
frontier? he asked. 

i had not worked that out yet, i said, and we both 
laughed. "but," i said, "in the old days the austrians 
were always whipped in the quadrilateral around ve-

rona. they let them come down onto the plain and 
whipped them there.' ' 

"yes," said gino. "but those were frenchmen and 
you can work out military problems clearly when you 
are fighting in somebody else's country." 

"yes," i agreed, "when it is your own country you 
cannot use it so scientifically." 

"the russians did, to trap napoleon." 

"yes, but they had plenty of country. if you tried 
to retreat to trap napoleon in italy you would find 
yourself in brindisi." 

"a terrible place," said gino. "have you ever been 
there?" 

"not to stay." 

"i am a patriot," gino said. "but

nothing was done with the meat 
except to bury it. there were many words that you 
could not stand to hear and finally only the names of 
places had dignity. certain numbers were the same 
way and certain dates and these with the names of the 
places were all you could say and have them mean any- 
thing. abstract words such as glory, honor, courage, 
or hallow were obscene beside the concrete names of 
villages, the numbers of roads, the names of rivers, the 
numbers of regiments and the dates. gino was a pa- 
triot, so he said things that separated us sometimes, 
but he was also a fine boy and i understood his being a 
patriot. he was born one. he left with peduzzi in the 
car to go back to gorizia. 

it stormed all that day. the wind drove down the 
rain and everywhere there was standing water and 
mud. the plaster of the broken houses was gray and 
wet. late in the afternoon the rain stopped and from
