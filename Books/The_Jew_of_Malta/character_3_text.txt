epilogue to the stage, at the cock-pit.

     in graving with pygmalion to contend,
     or painting with apelles, doubtless the end
     must be disgrace:  our actor did not so,--
     he only aim'd to go, but not out-go.
     nor think that this day any prize was play'd; [9]
     here were no bets at all, no wagers laid: [10]
     all the ambition that his mind doth swell,
     is but to hear from you (by me) 'twas well.

     to seize upon the town; ay, that he seeks.
     howe'er the world go, i'll make sure for one,

     and 'tis more kingly to obtain by peace
     than to enforce conditions by constraint.--
     what respite ask you, governor?

     ferneze. but a month.

     calymath. we grant a month; but see you keep your promise.
     now launch our galleys back again to sea,
     where we'll attend the respite you have ta'en,
     and for the money send our messenger.

     shall all be levied amongst the jews, and each of them to pay
     one half of his estate.

     barabas. how! half his estate!--i hope you mean not mine.
          [aside.]

     ferneze. read on.

     straight-become a christian.

     barabas. how! a christian!--hum,--what's here to do?
          [aside.]

     officer. [reads] lastly, he that denies this, shall absolutely
     lose all he has.

     three jews. o my lord, we will give half!

     barabas. o earth-mettled villains, and no hebrews born!
     and will you basely thus submit yourselves
     to leave your goods to their arbitrement?

 why, barabas, wilt thou be christened?

     barabas. no, governor, i will be no convertite. [39]

     ferneze. then pay thy half.

     barabas. why, know you what you did by this device?
     half of my substance is a city's wealth.
     governor, it was not got so easily;
     nor will i part so slightly therewithal.

     ferneze. sir, half is the penalty of our decree;
     either pay that, or we will seize on all.

     barabas. corpo di dio! stay:  you shall have half;
     let me be us'd but as my brethren are.

     ferneze. no, jew, thou hast denied the articles,
     and now it cannot be recall'd.

     'tis not our fault, but thy inherent sin.

     barabas. what, bring you scripture to confirm your wrongs?
     preach me not out of my possessions.
     some jews are wicked, as all christians are:
     but say the tribe that i descended of
     were all in general cast away for sin,
     shall i be tried by their transgression?
     the man that dealeth righteously shall live;
     and which of you can charge me otherwise?

     as if we knew not thy profession?
     if thou rely upon thy righteousness,
     be patient, and thy riches will increase.
     excess of wealth is cause of covetousness;
     and covetousness, o, 'tis a monstrous sin!

     and wares of barabas, which, being valu'd,
     amount to more than all the wealth in malta:
     and of the other we have seized half.

     you have my goods, my money, and my wealth,

     and, having all, you can request no more,
     unless your unrelenting flinty hearts
     suppress all pity in your stony breasts,

     ferneze. away with him! his sight is death to me.

     barabas. for what, you men of malta? hear me speak.
     she is a courtezan, and he a thief,
     and he my bondman:  let me have law;
     for none of this can prejudice my life.

     ferneze. once more, away with him!--you shall have law.

     barabas. devils, do your worst!--i['ll] live in spite of you.--
          [aside.]
     as these have spoke, so be it to their souls!--
     i hope the poison'd flowers will work anon.

     first officer. my lord, the courtezan and her man are dead;
     so is the turk and barabas the jew.

     first officer. dead, my lord, and here they bring his body.

     martin del bosco. this sudden death of his is very strange.

     calymath. if this be true, i'll make thee governor.

     to kept [187] thy promise than be thus surpris'd?

     of such a traitor and unhallow'd jew!
     what greater misery could heaven inflict?

     calymath. 'tis our command:--and, barabas, we give,
     to guard thy person, these our janizaries:
     entreat [188] them well, as we have used thee.--
     and now, brave bassoes, [189] come; we'll walk about

     thus hast thou gotten, [190] by thy policy,
     no simple place, no small authority:
     i now am governor of malta; true,--
     but malta hates me, and, in hating me,
     my life's in danger; and what boots it thee,
     poor barabas, to be the governor,
     whenas [191] thy life shall be at their command?
     no, barabas, this must be look'd into;
     and, since by wrong thou gott'st authority,
     maintain it bravely by firm policy;

     but barabas will be more circumspect.
     begin betimes; occasion's bald behind:
     slip not thine opportunity, for fear too late
     thou seek'st for much, but canst not compass it.--

     barabas. ay, lord; thus slaves will learn.
     now, governor,--stand by there, wait within,--
          [exeunt guard.]
     this is the reason that i sent for thee:
     thou seest thy life and malta's happiness
     are at my arbitrement; and barabas

     to dispossess himself of such a place?
     for sith, [193] as once you said, within this isle,
     in malta here, that i have got my goods,
     and in this city still have had success,
     and now at length am grown your governor,
     yourselves shall see it shall not be forgot;
     for, as a friend not known but in distress,
     i'll rear up malta, now remediless.

     ferneze. will barabas recover malta's loss?
     will barabas be good to christians?

     barabas. what wilt thou give me, governor, to procure
     a dissolution of the slavish bands
     wherein the turk hath yok'd your land and you?
     what will you give me if i render you
     the life of calymath, surprise his men,
     and in an out-house of the city shut
     his soldiers, till i have consum'd 'em all with fire?
     what will you give him that procureth this?

     nay, more, do this, and live thou governor still.

     barabas. nay, do thou this, ferneze, and be free:
     governor, i enlarge thee; live with me;
     go walk about the city, see thy friends:
     tush, send not letters to 'em; go thyself,
     and let me see what money thou canst make:
     here is my hand that i'll set malta free;
     and thus we cast [194] it:  to a solemn feast
     i will invite young selim calymath,
     where be thou present, only to perform
     one stratagem that i'll impart to thee,
     wherein no danger shall betide thy life,

     ferneze. here is my hand; believe me, barabas,
     i will be there, and do as thou desirest.
     when is the time?

     barabas. governor, presently;
     for calymath, when he hath view'd the town,
     will take his leave, and sail toward ottoman.

     ferneze. then will i, barabas, about this coin,
     and bring it with me to thee in the evening.

     barabas. do so; but fail not:  now farewell, ferneze:--
          [exit ferneze.]
     and thus far roundly goes the business:
     thus, loving neither, will i live with both,
     making a profit of my policy;
     and he from whom my most advantage comes,
     shall be my friend.
     this is the life we jews are us'd to lead;
     and reason too, for christians do the like.
     well, now about effecting this device;

     till you shall hear a culverin discharg'd
     by him that bears the linstock, [199] kindled thus;
     then issue out and come to rescue me,
     for happily i shall be in distress,
     or you released of this servitude.

     first knight. rather than thus to live as turkish thralls,
     what will we not adventure?

     messenger. he will; and has commanded all his men
     to come ashore, and march through malta-streets,
     that thou mayst feast them in thy citadel.

     barabas. then now are all things as my wish would have 'em;
     there wanteth nothing but the governor's pelf;
     and see, he brings it.

     barabas. pounds say'st thou, governor? well, since it is no more,
     i'll satisfy myself with that; nay, keep it still,

     barabas. o, help me, selim! help me, christians!
     governor, why stand you all so pitiless?

     ferneze. should i in pity of thy plaints or thee,

     no, thus i'll see thy treachery repaid,
     but wish thou hadst behav'd thee otherwise.

     barabas. you will not help me, then?

     ferneze. no, villain, no.

     barabas. and, villains, know you cannot help me now.--
     then, barabas, breathe forth thy latest fate,
     and in the fury of thy torments strive
     to end thy life with resolution.--

     damn'd christian [206] dogs, and turkish infidels!
     but now begins the extremity of heat
     to pinch me with intolerable pangs:
     die, life! fly, soul! tongue, curse thy fill, and die!
          [dies.]

     calymath. tell me, you christians, what doth this portend?

     ferneze. this train [207] he laid to have entrapp'd thy life;

     thus he determin'd to have handled thee,
     but i have rather chose to save thy life.

     calymath. was this the banquet he prepar'd for us?
     let's hence, lest further mischief be pretended. [208]

     ferneze. nay, selim, stay; for, since we have thee here,
     we will not let thee part so suddenly:
     besides, if we should let thee go, all's one,

     ferneze. why, heard'st thou not the trumpet sound a charge?

     calymath. yes, what of that?

     ferneze. why, then the house was fir'd,
     blown up, and all thy soldiers massacred.

     calymath. o, monstrous treason!

     ferneze. a jew's courtesy;
     for he that did by treason work our fall,
     by treason hath deliver'd thee to us:
     know, therefore, till thy father hath made good
     the ruins done to malta and to us,
     thou canst not part; for malta shall be freed,
     or selim ne'er return to ottoman.

     calymath. nay, rather, christians, let me go to turkey,
     in person there to mediate [209] your peace:
     to keep me here will naught advantage you.

     ferneze. content thee, calymath, here th
