York - 
      York believes he is heir to the throne of England, and this motivates his every action. Throughout this play and 1 Henry VI, he tries to stay calm and wait until Henry is weaker and can be more easily ousted, but his patience runs thin. Already involved in disputes against Somerset, York allies with Warwick and Salisbury against the other lords of the court. He explains to these two men that he is heir to the third son of Edward III, and Henry is heir to Edward III's fourth son. Richard II was wrongfully removed from the throne by Henry IV, meaning the Lancaster line, including Henry VI, held the throne illegally. York intends to correct that, and he is delighted to be sent to Ireland to put down rebellions, for that means he is given an army. When he leaves, he hires Jack Cade to stir up trouble by pretending to be a York claimant to the throne, intending to return should Cade's campaign prove popular. When he does return, he can no longer wait, and he declares his intentions to Henry.
