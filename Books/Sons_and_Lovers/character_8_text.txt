 not answer. he turned to miriam.

“where are you going?” he asked.

“to the castle.”

“what train are you going home by?”

“i am driving with father. i wish you could come too. what time are you
free?”

“you know not till eight to-night, damn it!”

and directly the two women moved on.

paul remembered that clara dawes was the daughter of an old friend of
mrs. leivers. miriam had sought her out because she had once been spiral
overseer at jordan’s, and because her husband, baxter dawes, was smith
for the factory, making the irons for cripple instruments, and so on.
through her miriam felt she got into direct contact with jordan’s, and
could estimate better paul’s position. but mrs. dawes was separated from
her husband, and had taken up women’s rights. she was supposed to be
clever. it interested paul.

baxter dawes he knew and disliked. the smith was a man of thirty-one or
thirty-two. he came occasionally through paul’s corner--a big, well-set
man, also striking to lo

give him. she could bear all if he were inwardly true to her and must
come back.

he saw none of the anomaly of his position. miriam was his old friend,
lover, and she belonged to bestwood and home and his youth. clara was a
newer friend, and she belonged to nottingham, to life, to the world. it
seemed to him quite plain.

mrs. dawes and he had many periods of coolness, when they saw little of
each other; but they always came together again.

“were you horrid with baxter dawes?” he asked her. it was a thing that
seemed to trouble him.

“in what way?”

“oh, i don’t know. but weren’t you horrid with him? didn’t you do
something that knocked him to pieces?”

“what, pray?”

“making him feel as if he were nothing--i know,” paul declared.

“you are so clever, my friend,” she said coolly.

the conversation broke off there. but it made her cool with him for some
time.

she very rarely saw miriam now. the friendship between the two women was

the river, their forward movement faltered to an end. he led her across
to the grass, under the trees at the edge of the path. the cliff of red
earth sloped swiftly down, through trees and bushes, to the river that
glimmered and was dark between the foliage. the far-below water-meadows
were very green. he and she stood leaning against one another, silent,
afraid, their bodies touching all along. there came a quick gurgle from
the river below.

“why,” he asked at length, “did you hate baxter dawes?”

she turned to him with a splendid movement. her mouth was offered him,
and her throat; her eyes were half-shut; her breast was tilted as if it
asked for him. he flashed with a small laugh, shut his eyes, and met
her in a long, whole kiss. her mouth fused with his; their bodies were
sealed and annealed. it was some minutes before they withdrew. they were
standing beside the public path.

“will you go down to the river?” he asked.

she looked at him, leaving herself in his hands. he went

“who?”

“you and clara and me.”

“what, on your money!” she exclaimed, half-wrathful.

“why not?”

“you wouldn’t be long in breaking your neck at a hurdle race!” she said.

“so long as i get a good run for my money! will you?”

“nay; you may settle that atween you.”

“and you’re willing?” he asked, amazed and rejoicing.

“you’ll do as you like,” said mrs. radford, “whether i’m willing or
not.”



chapter xiii

baxter dawes

soon after paul had been to the theatre with clara, he was drinking
in the punch bowl with some friends of his when dawes came in. clara’s
husband was growing stout; his eyelids were getting slack over his brown
eyes; he was losing his healthy firmness of flesh. he was very evidently
on the downward track. having quarrelled with his sister, he had gone
into cheap lodgings. his mistress had left him for a man who would marry
her. he had been in prison one night for fighting when he was drunk,

 and
there was a shady betting episode in which he was concerned.

paul and he were confirmed enemies, and yet there was between them that
peculiar feeling of intimacy, as if they were secretly near to each
other, which sometimes exists between two people, although they never
speak to one another. paul often thought of baxter dawes, often wanted
to get at him and be friends with him. he knew that dawes often thought
about him, and that the man was drawn to him by some bond or other. and
yet the two never looked at each other save in hostility.

since he was a superior employee at jordan’s, it was the thing for paul
to offer dawes a drink.

“what’ll you have?” he asked of him.

“nowt wi’ a bleeder like you!” replied the man.

paul turned away with a slight disdainful movement of the shoulders,
very irritating

ad a curious sensation of pity, almost of affection, mingled with
violent hate, for the man. the coloured door swung to; there was silence
in the bar.

“serve, him, jolly well right!” said the barmaid.

“but it’s a nasty thing to get a glass of beer in your eyes,” said the
mutual friend.

“i tell you i was glad he did,” said the barmaid. “will you have
another, mr. morel?”

she held up paul’s glass questioningly. he nodded.

“he’s a man as doesn’t care for anything, is baxter dawes,” said one.

“pooh! is he?” said the barmaid. “he’s a loud-mouthed one, he is, and
they’re never much good. give me a pleasant-spoken chap, if you want a
devil!”

“well, paul, my lad,” said the friend, “you’ll have to take care of
yourself now for a while.”

“you won’t have to give him a chance over you, that’s all,” said the
barmaid.

“can you box?” asked a friend.

“not a bit,” he answered, still very white.

“i might give you a turn or two,” said t

riend.

“thanks, i haven’t time.”

and presently he took his departure.

“go along with him, mr. jenkinson,” whispered the barmaid, tipping mr.
jenkinson the wink.

the man nodded, took his hat, said: “good-night all!” very heartily, and
followed paul, calling:

“half a minute, old man. you an’ me’s going the same road, i believe.”

“mr. morel doesn’t like it,” said the barmaid. “you’ll see, we shan’t
have him in much more. i’m sorry; he’s good company. and baxter dawes
wants locking up, that’s what he wants.”

paul would have died rather than his mother should get to know of this
affair. he suffered tortures of humiliation and self-consciousness.
there was now a good deal of his life of which necessarily he could not
speak to his mother. he had a life apart from her--his sexual life. the
rest she still kept. but he felt he had to conceal something from her,
and it irked him. there was a certain silence between them, and he
felt he had, in that silence, to

everybody was in bed. he looked at himself. his face was discoloured
and smeared with blood, almost like a dead man’s face. he washed it, and
went to bed. the night went by in delirium. in the morning he found his
mother looking at him. her blue eyes--they were all he wanted to see.
she was there; he was in her hands.

“it’s not much, mother,” he said. “it was baxter dawes.”

“tell me where it hurts you,” she said quietly.

“i don’t know--my shoulder. say it was a bicycle accident, mother.”

he could not move his arm. presently minnie, the little servant, came
upstairs with some tea.

“your mother’s nearly frightened me out of my wits--fainted away,” she
said.

he felt he could not bear it. his mother nursed him; he told her about
it.

“and now i should have done with them all,” she said quietly.

“i will, mother.”

she covered him up.

and minnie, the little quaint maid, said:

there was a lovely yellow ravel of sunflowers in the garden. she looked
out of the window.

“there are my sunflowers!” she said.

the release

“by the way,” said dr. ansell one evening when morel was in
sheffield, “we’ve got a man in the fever hospital here who comes from
nottingham--dawes. he doesn’t seem to have many belongings in this
world.”

“baxter dawes!” paul exclaimed.

“that’s the man--has been a fine fellow, physically, i should think.
been in a bit of a mess lately. you know him?”

“he used to work at the place where i am.”

“did he? do you know anything about him? he’s just sulking, or he’d be a
lot better than he is by now.”

“i don’t know anything of his home circumstances, except that he’s
separated from his wife and has been a bit down, i believe. but tell him
about me, will you? tell him i’ll come and see

.’ so i went and made her the food.
it’s the cancer that gnaws like that at her. i wish she’d die!”

“come!” said clara roughly. “i’m going.”

he followed her down the darkness of the sands. he did not come to her.
he seemed scarcely aware of her existence. and she was afraid of him,
and disliked him.

in the same acute daze they went back to nottingham. he was always
busy, always doing something, always going from one to the other of his
friends.

on the monday he went to see baxter dawes. listless and pale, the man
rose to greet the other, clinging to his chair as he held out his hand.

“you shouldn’t get up,” said paul.

dawes sat down heavily, eyeing morel with a sort of suspicion.

“don’t you waste your time on me,” he said, “if you’ve owt better to
do.”

“i wanted to come,” said paul. “here! i brought you some sweets.”

the invalid put them aside.

“it’s not been much of a week-end,” said morel.

“how’s your mother?” asked the other.
