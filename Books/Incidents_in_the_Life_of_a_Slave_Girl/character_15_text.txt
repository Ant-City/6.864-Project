y freely as to the respect mr. sands's showed for his wife, and for his own character, in acknowledging those "young niggers." and as for sending ellen away, she pronounced it to be just as much stealing as it would be for him to come and take a piece of furniture out of her parlor. she said her daughter was not of age to sign the bill of sale, and the children were her property; and when she became of age, or was married, she could take them, wherever she could lay hands on them.

        miss emily flint, the little girl to whom i had been bequeathed, was now in her sixteenth year. her mother considered it all right and honorable for her, or her future husband, to steal my children; but she did not understand how any body could hold up their heads in respectable society, after they had purchased their own children, as mr. sands had done. dr. flint said very little. perhaps he thought that benny would be less likely to be sent away if he kept quiet. one of my letters, that fell into his hands, w

uch we had to tell each other! how we laughed, and how we cried, over each other's adventures! i took him to brooklyn, and again saw him with ellen, the dear child whom he had loved and tended so carefully, while i was shut up in my miserable den. he staid in new york a week. his old feelings of affection for me and ellen were as lively as ever. there are no bonds so strong as those which are formed by suffering together.

the old enemy again.

        my young mistress, miss emily flint, did not return any answer to my letter requesting her to consent to my being sold. but after a while, i received a reply, which purported to be written by her younger brother. in order rightly to enjoy the contents of this letter, the reader must bear in mind that the flint family supposed i had been at the north many years. they had no idea that i knew of the doctor's three excursions to new york in search of me; that i had heard his voice, when he came to borrow five hundred dollars for that

        not long after my return, i received the following letter from miss emily flint, now mrs. dodge:â€”

        "in this you will recognize the hand of your friend and mistress. having heard that you had gone with a family to europe, i have waited to hear of your return to write to you. i should have answered the letter you wrote to me long since, but as i could not then act independently of my father, i knew there could be nothing done satisfactory to you. there were persons here who were willing to buy you and run the risk of getting you. to this i would not consent. i have

        "i don't know, sir."

        "do you know where she went?"

        "i do not, sir." and the door was closed.

        this mr. dodge, who claimed me as his property, was originally a yankee pedler in the south; then he became a merchant, and finally a slaveholder. he managed to get introduced into what was called the first society, and married miss emily flint. a quarrel arose between him and her brother, and the brother cowhided him. this led to a family feud, and he proposed to remove to virginia. dr. flint left him no property, and his own means had become circumscribed, while a wife and children depended upon him for support. under these circumstances, it was very natural that he should make an effort to put me into his pocket.
