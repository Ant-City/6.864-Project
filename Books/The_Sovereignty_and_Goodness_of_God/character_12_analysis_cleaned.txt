[CHARACTER]
one of quannopin's three wives, [CHARACTER] is one of the indians with whom
rowlandson has the most contact. unfortunately for rowlandson, [CHARACTER] is
proud and vain, with a strong streak of cruelty. [CHARACTER]'s greatest concerns
are image and status. she sometimes does not feed rowlandson well or let her
warm herself by the fire, but she complains that she and quannopin look bad when
rowlandson begs for food or a warm place to sleep at other wigwams. [CHARACTER] is
angered by rowlandson's faith and piety and her ability to find comfort in the
bible. when [CHARACTER]'s child has died and she returns from its burial to find
rowlandson reading the bible, she is enraged and throws her bible to the ground.
[CHARACTER]'s short-temperedness appears at other times as well. on the same day,
she slaps rowlandson across the face and tells her to get out of her sight.
though both rowlandson and [CHARACTER] have lost young children, this does not
become a point of sympathy or bonding for them.
rowlandson casts [CHARACTER] as something of a foil of herself: the two are
opposites, and by listing [CHARACTER]'s bad qualities, rowlandson subtly
emphasizes her own positive traits. when describing [CHARACTER]'s daily routine,
rowlandson compares her to wealthy white nobles: [CHARACTER] spends as much time
arranging her hair, clothing, and jewelry as the richest of the settlers. her
shallowness shows that savagery and violence are not the indians' only negative
qualities--vanity in such rugged conditions is ridiculous. [CHARACTER]'s values are
opposite to those christian values that rowlandson espouses. while rowlandson
learns that worldly treasures have little use or meaning, [CHARACTER] focuses on
the superficial trappings of clothing and status.
