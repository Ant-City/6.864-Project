helicopter and stood there for a moment. then he did an odd thing. he
leaned in and put his head against my shoulder and almost hugged me.
coming from rat kiley, that was something new.

on the ride into chu lai, i kept waiting for the pain to hit, but in fact i

didn't feel much. a throb, that's all. even in the hospital it wasn't bad.

when  i  got  back  to  alpha  company  twenty-six  days  later,  in  mid-
december, rat kiley had been wounded and shipped off to japan, and a
new medic named bobby jorgenson had replaced him. jorgenson was no
rat kiley. he was green and incompetent and scared. so when i got shot
the second time, in the butt, along the song tra bong, it took the son of a
bitch  almost  ten  minutes  to  work  up  the  nerve  to  crawl  over  to  me.  by
then i was gone with the pain. later i found out i'd almost died of shock.
bobby  jorgenson  didn't  know  about  shock,  or  if  he  did,  the  fear  made
him forget. to make it worse, he bungled the patch job, and a couple of

etty  soon  i'd  start
remembering  how  bobby  jorgenson  had  almost  killed  me.  shock,  i'd
think—how could he forget to treat for shock?

i'd remember how long it took him to get to me, and how his fingers
were all jerky and nervous, and the way his lips kept twitching under that
ridiculous little mustache.



the  nights  were  miserable.  sometimes  i'd  roam  around  the  base.  i'd
head down to the wire and stare out at the darkness, out where the war
was, and think up ways to make bobby jorgenson feel exactly what i felt.
i wanted to hurt him.


in march, alpha company came in for stand-down. i was there at the
helipad  to  meet  the  choppers.  mitchell  sanders  and  azar  and  henry
dobbins and dave jensen and norman bowker slapped hands with me
and  we  piled  their  gear  in  my  jeep  and  drove  down  to  the  alpha
hootches. we partied until chow time. afterward, we kept on partying. it
was  one  of  the  rituals.  even  if  you  weren't  in  the  mood,  you  did  it  on

bowker  smiled.  he  reached  out  and  put  his  hand  on  my  knee  and

squeezed.

"that's the kicker, man. no more morty."
"no?"
"morty's luck gets all used up," bowker said. his hand still rested on
my knee, very lightly. "a few days later, maybe a week, he feels real dizzy.
pukes  a  lot,  temperature  zooms  way  up.  i  mean,  the  guy's  sick.

swallowed a vc virus or something."

"bobby jorgenson," i said. "where is he?"
"be cool."
"where's my good buddy bobby?"
norman  bowker  made  a  short  clicking  sound  with  his  tongue.  "you

want to hear this? yes or no?"

"sure i do."
"so listen up, then. morty gets sick. like you never seen nobody so bad
off.  this  is  real  kickass  disease,  he  can't  walk  or  talk,  can't  fart.  can't

henry dobbins shook his head. "not polio. you got it wrong."
"maybe polio."
"no way," said dobbins. "not

idn't  fit  anymore.  they  were  soldiers,  i
wasn't. in a few days they'd saddle up and head back into the bush, and
i'd  stand  up  on  the  helipad  to  watch  them  march  away,  and  then  after
they were gone i'd spend the day loading resupply choppers until it was
time  to  catch  a  movie  or  play  cards  or  drink  myself  to  sleep.  a  funny
thing, but i felt betrayed.

for a long while i just stared at mitchell sanders.
"loyalty," i said. "such a pal."



in the morning i ran into bobby jorgenson. i was loading hueys up on
the helipad, and when the last bird took off, while i was putting on my
shirt, i looked over and saw him leaning against my jeep, waiting for me.



it was a surprise. he seemed smaller than i remembered, a little squirrel
of a guy, short and stumpy-looking.

he nodded nervously.
"well," he said.
at  first  i  just  looked  down  at  his  boots.  those  boots:  i  remembered
them from when i got shot. out along the song tra bong, a bullet inside
me, all that pain, bu

 beta kappa and summa cum laude, all
the credentials, but after seven months in the bush i realized that those
high, civilized trappings had somehow been crushed under the weight of
the  simple  daily  realities.  i'd  turned  mean  inside.  even  a  little  cruel  at
times. for all my education, all my fine liberal values, i now felt a deep
coldness inside me, something dark and beyond reason. it's a hard thing
to  admit,  even  to  myself,  but  i  was  capable  of  evil.  i  wanted  to  hurt
bobby jorgenson the way he'd hurt me. for weeks it had been a vow—i'll
get him, i'll get him—it was down inside me like a rock. granted, i didn't
hate him anymore, and i'd lost some of the outrage and passion, but the
need  for  revenge  kept  eating  at  me.  at  night  i  sometimes  drank  too
much.  i'd  remember  getting  shot  and  yelling  out  for  a  medic  and  then
waiting and waiting and waiting, passing out once, then waking up and
screaming  some  more,  and  how  the  screaming  seemed  to  m

i knew that, but right

and wrong were somewhere else. this was the spirit world.

i heard myself laugh.
and  then  presently  i  came  unattached  from  the  natural  world.  i  felt
the hinges go. eyes closed, i seemed to rise up out of my own body and
float  through  the  dark  down  to  jorgenson's  position.  i  was  invisible;  i
had no shape, no substance; i weighed less than nothing. i just drifted. it



was  imagination,  of  course,  but  for  a  long  while  i  hovered  there  over
bobby jorgenson's bunker. as if through dark glass i could see him lying
flat  in  his  circle  of  sandbags,  silent  and  scared,  listening.  rubbing  his
eyes.  telling  himself  it  was  all  a  trick  of  the  dark.  muscles  tight,  ears
tight—i  could  see  it.  now,  at  this  instant,  he'd  glance  up  at  the  sky,
hoping  for  a  moon  or  a  few  stars.  but  no  moon,  no  stars.  he'd  start
talking  to  himself.  he'd  try  to  bring  the  night  into  focus,  willing
coherence,  but  the  e

azar switched off the tape.
"shit, man," he said. "don't you got music?"



and now, finally, the moon was out. we slipped back to our positions
and  went  to  work  again  with  the  ropes.  louder  now,  more  insistent.
starlight sparkled in the barbed wire, and there were curious reflections
and  layerings  of  shadow,  and  the  big  white  moon  added  resonance.
there  was  no  wind.  the  night  was  absolute.  slowly,  we  dragged  the
ammo cans closer to bobby jorgenson's bunker, and this, plus the moon,
gave a sense of approaching peril, the slow belly-down crawl of evil.

at 0300 hours azar set off the first trip flare.
there  was  a  light  popping  noise,  then  a  sizzle  out  in  front  of  bunker
six. the night seemed to snap itself in half. the white flare burned  ten
paces from the bunker.

i fired off three more flares and it was instant daylight.
then  jorgenson  moved.  he  made  a  short,  low  cry—not  even  a  cry,
really,  just  a  short  lun
