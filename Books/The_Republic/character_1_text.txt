ich is the special characteristic of our
part of the world, or of the love of money, which may, with equal truth,
be attributed to the phoenicians and egyptians.

exactly so, he said.

there is no difficulty in understanding this.

none whatever.

but the question is not quite so easy when we proceed to ask whether
these principles are three or one; whether, that is to say, we learn
with one part of our nature, are angry with another, and with a third
part desire the satisfaction of our natural appetites; or whether the
whole soul comes into play in each sort of action--to determine that is
the difficulty.

yes, he said; there lies the difficulty.

then let us now try and determine whether they are the same or
different.

how can we? he asked.

i replied as follows: the same thing clearly cannot act or be acted upon
in the same part or in relation to the same thing at the same time,
in contrary ways; and therefore whenever this contradiction occurs in
things apparently the same, we know that t

the whole.

and may we not say of the philosopher that he is a lover, not of a part
of wisdom only, but of the whole?

yes, of the whole.

and he who dislikes learning, especially in youth, when he has no power
of judging what is good and what is not, such an one we maintain not
to be a philosopher or a lover of knowledge, just as he who refuses his
food is not hungry, and may be said to have a bad appetite and not a
good one?

very true, he said.

whereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is
curious to learn and is never satisfied, may be justly termed a
philosopher? am i not right?

glaucon said: if curiosity makes a philosopher, you will find many a
strange being will have a title to the name. all the lovers of sights
have a delight in learning, and must therefore be included. musical
amateurs, too, are a folk strangely out of place among philosophers, for

conversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one.

and the avaricious, i said, is the oligarchical youth?

yes, he said; at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like the
state out of which oligarchy came.

let us then consider whether there is any likeness between them.

very good.

first, then, they resemble one another in the value which they set upon
wealth?

certainly.

also in their penurious, laborious character; the individual only
satisfies his necessary appetites, and confines his expenditure to them;
his other desires he subdues, under the idea that they are unprofitable.

true.

he is a shabby fellow, who saves something out of everything and makes a
purse for himself; and this is the sort of man whom the vulgar applaud.
is he not a true image of the state which he represents?

he appears to me to be so; at any rate money is highly valued by him as
well as by the state.

you see that he is not a man of cultivation, i said.

i imagine not, he said; ha

his inferior ones.

true.

for these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most people;
yet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will flee far
away and never come near him.

i should expect so.

and surely, the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in a
state for any prize of victory, or other object of honourable ambition;
he will not spend his money in the contest for glory; so afraid is he of
awakening his expensive appetites and inviting them to help and join in
the struggle; in true oligarchical fashion he fights with a small part
only of his resources, and the result commonly is that he loses the
prize and saves his money.

very true.

can we any longer doubt, then, that the miser and money-maker answers to
the oligarchical state?

there can be no doubt.

next comes democracy; of this the origin and nature have still to
be considered by us; and then we will enquire into the ways of the
democratic man, and bring

there is a battle and they gain the day, and then modesty, which
they call silliness, is ignominiously thrust into exile by them, and
temperance, which they nickname unmanliness, is trampled in the mire and
cast forth; they persuade men that moderation and orderly expenditure
are vulgarity and meanness, and so, by the help of a rabble of evil
appetites, they drive them beyond the border.

yes, with a will.

and when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of him who is now in
their power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries, the
next thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy and
waste and impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads, and
a great company with them, hymning their praises and calling them by
sweet names; insolence they term breeding, and anarchy liberty, and
waste magnificence,

 said.

neither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word of
advice; if any one says to him that some pleasures are the satisfactions
of good and noble desires, and others of evil desires, and that he ought
to use and honour some and chastise and master the others--whenever this
is repeated to him he shakes his head and says that they are all alike,
and that one is as good as another.

yes, he said; that is the way with him.

yes, i said, he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the
hour; and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute; then
he becomes a water-drinker, and tries to get thin; then he takes a turn
at gymnastics; sometimes idling and neglecting everything, then once
more living the life of a philosopher; often he is busy with politics,
and starts to his feet and says and does whatever comes into his head;
and, if he is emulous of any one who is a warrior, off he is in that
direction, or of men of business, once more in that. his life has

book ix.

last of all comes the tyrannical man; about whom we have once more to
ask, how is he formed out of the democratical? and how does he live, in
happiness or in misery?

yes, he said, he is the only one remaining.

there is, however, i said, a previous question which remains unanswered.

what question?

i do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number
of the appetites, and until this is accomplished the enquiry will always
be confused.

well, he said, it is not too late to supply the omission.

very true, i said; and observe the point which i want to understand:
certain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites i conceive to be
unlawful; every one appears to have them, but in some persons they are
controlled by the laws and by reason, and the better desires prevail
over them--either they are wholly banished or they become few and weak;
while in the case of

 others they are stronger, and there are more of
them.

which appetites do you mean?

i mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling
power is asleep; then the wild beast within us, gorged with meat or
drink, starts up and having shaken off sleep, goes forth to satisfy
his desires; and there is no conceivable folly or crime--not excepting
incest or any other unnatural union, or parricide, or the eating of
forbidden food--which at such a time, when he has parted company with
all shame and sense, a man may not be ready to commit.

most true, he

said.

but when a man's pulse is healthy and temperate, and when before going
to sleep he has awakened his rational powers, and fed them on noble
thoughts and enquiries, collecting himself in meditation; after having
first indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little, but just
enough to lay them to sleep, and prevent them and their enjoyments and
pains from interfering with the higher principle--which he leaves in
the solitude of pure abstraction, free to contemplate and aspire to
the knowledge of the unknown, whether in past, present, or future: when
again he has allayed the passionate element, if he has a quarrel against
any one--i say, when, after pacifying the two irrational principles, he
rouses up the third, which is r

antastic and lawless visions.

i quite agree.

in saying this i have been running into a digression; but the point
which i desire to note is that in all of us, even in good men, there is
a lawless wild-beast nature, which peers out in sleep. pray, consider
whether i am right, and you agree with me.

yes, i agree.

and now remember the character which we attributed to the democratic
man. he was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under
a miserly parent, who encouraged the saving appetites in him, but
discountenanced the unnecessary, which aim only at amusement and
ornament?

true.

and then he got into the company of a more refined, licentious sort of
people, and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite
extreme from an abhorrence of his father's meanness. at last, being a
better man than his corruptors, he was drawn in both directions until he
halted midway and led a life, not of vulgar and slavish passion, but
of what he deemed moderate indulgence in various pl

will adequately describe him.

yes, he said, that is the only adequate image of him.

and when his other lusts, amid clouds of incense and perfumes and
garlands and wines, and all the pleasures of a dissolute life, now let
loose, come buzzing around him, nourishing to the utmost the sting of
desire which they implant in his drone-like nature, then at last this
lord of the soul, having madness for the captain of his guard, breaks
out into a frenzy: and if he finds in himself any good opinions or
appetites in process of formation, and there is in him any sense of
shame remaining, to these better principles he puts an end, and casts
them forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in madness to
the full.

yes, he said, that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated.

and is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?

i should not wonder.

further, i said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant?

he has.

and you know that a man who is deranged and

hink, furnish a new demonstration.

of what nature?

it seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures
correspond; also three desires and governing powers.

how do you mean? he said.

there is one principle with which, as we were saying, a man learns,
another with which he is angry; the third, having many forms, has no
special name, but is denoted by the general term appetitive, from
the extraordinary strength and vehemence of the desires of eating and
drinking and the other sensual appetites which are the main elements of
it; also money-loving, because such desires are generally satisfied by
the help of money.

that is true, he said.

if we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were
concerned with gain, we should then be able to fall back on a single
notion; and might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul
as loving gain or money.

i agree with you.

again, is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering
and getting fame?
