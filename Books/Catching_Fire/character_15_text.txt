inseparable team. 



effie needn't have worried about us being the last to 
arrive. only brutus and the woman from district 2, 
enobaria, are present. enobaria looks to be about 
thirty and all i can remember about her is that, in 
hand-to-hand combat, she killed one tribute by 
ripping open his throat with her teeth. she became so 
famous for this act that, after she was a victor, she 
had her teeth cosmetically altered so each one ends in 
a sharp point like a fang and is inlaid with gold. she 
has no shortage of admirers in the capitol. 

by ten o'clock, only about half of the tributes have 
shown up. atala, the woman who run

last year, and that they probably knew them and

and exchange a few comments, but it's clear neither 
of us wants to team up. finnick appears again when 
i'm picking up fishing tips, but mostly just to 
introduce me to mags, the elderly woman who's also 
from district 4. between her district accent and her 
garbled speech — possibly she's had a stroke — i can't 
make out more than one in four words. but i swear 
she can make a decent fishhook out of anything — a 
thorn, a wishbone, an earring. after a while i tune out

and gives me a squeeze. "come on and let's go get 
those training scores." 

we gather around the television set and a red-eyed 
effie rejoins us. the tributes' faces come up, district 
by district, and their scores flash under their 
pictures. one through twelve. predictably high scores 
for cashmere, gloss, brutus, enobaria, and finnick. 
low to medium for the rest. 

"have they ever given a zero?" i ask. 

"no, but there's a first time for everything," cinna 
answers. 

and it turns out he's right. because when peeta and i 
each pull a twelve, we make hunger games history. 
no one feels like celebrating, though. 

"why did they do that?" i ask. 

"so that the others will have no choice but to target 
you," says haymitch flatly. "go to bed. i can't stand to 
look at either one of you."

hair and face highlighted in lavender this year, has 
done his opening spiel and the tributes begin their 
interviews. this is the first time i realize the depth of 
betrayal felt among the victors and the rage that 
accompanies it. but they are so smart, so wonderfully 
smart about how they play it, because it all comes 
back to reflect on the government and president snow 
in particular. not everyone. there are the old 
throwbacks, like brutus and enobaria, who are just 
here for another games, and those too baffled or 
drugged or lost to join in on the attack. but there are 
enough victors who still have the wits and the nerve 
to come out fighting. 

cashmere starts the ball rolling with a speech about 
how she just can't stop crying when she thinks of how 
much the people in the capitol must be suffering 
because they will lose us. gloss recalls the kindness 
shown here to him and his sister. beetee questions

their loss. i turn spontaneously to chaff and offer my 
hand. i feel my fingers close around the stump that 
now completes his arm and hold fast. 

and then it happens. up and down the row, the 
victors begin to join hands. some right away, like the 
morphlings, or wiress and beetee. others unsure but 
caught up in the demands of those around them, like 
brutus and enobaria. by the time the anthem plays 
its final strains, all twenty-four of us stand in one 
unbroken line in what must be the first public show 
of unity among the districts since the dark days. you 
can see the realization of this as the screens begin to 
pop into blackness. it's too late, though. in the 
confusion they didn't cut us off in time. everyone has

nt from his usual seductive purr, that i do. 
his trident goes whizzing over my head and there's a 
sickening sound of impact as it finds its target. the 
man from district 5, the drunk who threw up on the 
sword-fighting floor, sinks to his knees as finnick 
frees the trident from his chest. "don't trust one and 
two," finnick says. 

there's no time to question this. i work the sheath of 
arrows free. "each take one side?" i say. he nods, and 
i dart around the pile. about four spokes apart, 
enobaria and gloss are just reaching land. either 
they're slow swimmers or they thought the water 
might be laced with other dangers, which it might 
well be. sometimes it's not good to consider too many 
scenarios. but now that they're on the sand, they 11 be 
here in a matter of seconds. 

"anything useful?" i hear finnick shout. 

i quickly scan the pile on my side and find maces, 
swords, bows and arrows, tridents, knives, spears, 
axes, metallic objects i have no name for... and 
nothing else.

"weapons!" i call back. "nothing but weapons!" 

"same here," he confirms. "grab what you want and 
let's go!" 

i shoot an arrow at enobaria, who's gotten in too 
close for comfort, but she's expecting it and dives 
back into the water before it can find its mark. gloss 
isn't quite as swift, and i sink an arrow into his calf 
as he plunges into the waves. i sling an extra bow and 
a second sheath of arrows over my body, slide two 
long knives and an awl into my belt, and meet up 
with finnick at the front of the pile. 

"do something about that, would you?" he says. i see 
brutus barreling toward us. his belt is undone and 
he has

it stretched between his hands as a kind of 
shield. i shoot at him and he manages to block the 
arrow with his belt before it can skewer his liver. 
where it punctures the belt, a purple liquid spews 
forth, coating his face. as i reload, brutus flattens on 
the ground, rolls the few feet to the water, and 
submerges. there's a clang of metal falling behind 
me. "let's clear out," i say to finnick. 

this last altercation has given enobaria and gloss 
time to reach the cornucopia. brutus is within 
shooting distance and somewhere, certainly, 
cashmere is nearby, too. these four classic careers 
will no doubt have a prior alliance. if i had only my 
own safety to consider, i might be willing to take them 
on with finnick by my side. but it's peeta i'm 
thinking about. i spot him now, still stranded on his 
metal plate. i take off and finnick follows without 
question, as if knowing this will be my next move.

abdomen. 

oh, right. i'm supposed to be pregnant, i think. while 
i'm trying to think what that means and how i should 
act — maybe throw up or something — finnick has 
positioned himself at the edge of the water. 

"cover me," he says. he disappears with a flawless 
dive. 

i raise my bow, warding off any attackers from the 
cornucopia, but no one seems interested in pursuing 
us. 

sure enough, gloss, cashmere, enobaria, and brutus 
have gathered, their pack formed already, picking 
over the weapons. a quick survey of the rest of the 
arena shows that most of the tributes are still trapped 
on their plates. wait, no, there's someone standing on 
the spoke to my left, the one opposite peeta. it's mags. 
but she neither heads for the cornucopia nor tries to 
flee. instead she splashes into the water and starts 
paddling toward me, her gray head bobbing above the 
waves. well, she's old, but i guess after eighty

finnick asks. 

"no," i say. 

"no," finnick repeats. "because whatever happened 
in the past is in the past. and no one in this arena 
was a victor by chance." he eyes peeta for a moment. 
"except maybe peeta." 

finnick knows then what haymitch and i know. 
about peeta. being truly, deep-down better than the 
rest of us. finnick took out that tribute from 5 
without blinking an eye. and how long did i take to 
turn deadly? i shot to kill when i targeted enobaria 
and gloss and brutus. peeta would at least have 
attempted negotiations first. seen if some wider 
alliance was possible. but to what end? finnick's 
right. i'm right. the people in this arena weren't 
crowned for their compassion. 

i hold his gaze, weighing his speed against my own. 
the time it will take to send an arrow through his 
brain versus the time his trident will reach my body. i 
can see him, waiting for me to make the first move.

i don't wait. i load an arrow as i twist and get a 
glimpse of a dripping-wet gloss letting wiress slide to 
the ground, her throat slit open in a bright red smile. 
the point of my arrow disappears into his right 
temple, and in the instant it takes to reload, johanna 
has buried an ax blade in cashmere's chest. finnick 
knocks away a spear brutus throws at peeta and 
takes enobaria's knife in his thigh. if there wasn't a 
cornucopia to duck behind, they'd be dead, both of 
the tributes from district 2. i spring forward in 
pursuit. boom! boom! boom! the cannon confirms 
there's no way to help wiress, no need to finish off 
gloss or cashmere. my allies and i are rounding the 
horn, starting to give chase to brutus and enobaria, 
who are sprinting down a sand strip toward the 
jungle. 

suddenly the ground jerks beneath my feet and i'm

johanna, and beetee have all lost their district 
partners. i cross to peeta and wrap my arms around 
him, and for a while we all stay silent. 

"let's get off this stinking island," johanna says 
finally. there's only the matter of our weapons now, 
which we've largely retained. fortunately the vines 
here are strong and the spile and tube of medicine 
wrapped in the parachute are still secured to my belt. 
finnick strips off his undershirt and ties it around 
the wound enobaria's knife made in his thigh; it's not 
deep. beetee thinks he can walk now, if we go slowly, 
so i help him up. we decide to head to the beach at 
twelve o'clock. that should provide hours of calm and 
keep us clear of any poisonous residue. and then 
peeta, johanna, and finnick head off in three 
different directions. 

"twelve o'clock, right?" says peeta. "the tail points at 
twelve." 

"before they spun us," says finnick. "i was judging by 
the sun."

on the sun. but i just nod my head like i've been on 
the same page all along. "yes, so any one of these 
paths could lead to twelve o'clock," i say. 

we circle around the cornucopia, scrutinizing the 
jungle. it has a baffling uniformity. i remember the 
tall tree that took the first lightning strike at twelve 
o'clock, but every sector has a similar tree. johanna 
thinks to follow enobaria's and brutus's tracks, but 
they have been blown or washed away. there's no 
way to tell where anything is. "i should have never 
mentioned the clock," i say bitterly. "now they've 
taken that advantage away as well." 

"only temporarily," says beetee. "at ten, well see the 
wave again and be back on track." 

"yes, they can't redesign the whole arena," says peeta. 

"it doesn't matter," says johanna impatiently. "you

 peeta. i retrace our steps, starting from 
the moment the gong rang out, searching for the 
source of my discomfort. finnick towing peeta in off 
his metal plate. finnick reviving peeta after the force 
field stopped his heart. mags running into the fog so 
that finnick could carry peeta. the morphling hurling 
herself in front of him to block the monkey's attack. 
the fight with the careers was so quick, but didn't 
finnick block brutus 's spear from hitting peeta even 
though it meant taking enobaria's knife in his leg? 
and even now johanna has him drawing a map on a 
leaf rather than risking the jungle... 

there is no question about it. for reasons completely 
unfathomable to me, some of the other victors are 
trying to keep him alive, even if it means sacrificing 
themselves. 

i'm dumbfounded. for one thing, that's my job. for 
another, it doesn't make sense. only one of us can get 
out. so why have they chosen peeta to protect? what

how to rid himself of the itchy scabs, and as we scrub 
ourselves, i bring up our escape. 

"look, the pool is down to eight. i think it's time we 
took off," i say under my breath, although i doubt any 
of the tributes can hear me. 

peeta nods, and i can see him considering my 
proposition. weighing if the odds will be in our favor.

"tell you what," he says. "let's stick around until 
brutus and enobaria are dead. i think beetee's trying 
to put together some kind of trap for them now. then, 
i promise, well go." 

i'm not entirely convinced. but if we leave now, we'll 
have two sets of adversaries after us. maybe three, 
because who knows what chaffs up to? plus the 
clock to contend with. and then there's beetee to 
think of. johanna only brought him for me, and if we 
leave shell surely kill him. then i remember. i can't 
protect beetee, too. there can only be one victor and

the three of us scour all the scabs from our bodies, 
helping with the others' backs, and come out the 
same pink as the sky. we apply another round of 
medicine because the skin seems too delicate for the 
sunlight, but it doesn't look half as bad on smooth 
skin and will be good camouflage in the jungle. 

beetee calls us over, and it turns out that during all 
those hours of fiddling with wire, he has indeed come 
up with a plan. "i think well all agree our next job is 
to kill brutus and enobaria," he says mildly. "i doubt 
theyll attack us openly again, now that they're so 
outnumbered. we could track them down, i suppose, 
but it's dangerous, exhausting work." 

"do you think they've figured out about the clock?" i 
ask.

"or not," i mutter, since she's always pretty much 
rabid, but i don't stop him, because i'd be angry 
myself if i was excluded from a plan at this point. 

when she's joined us, beetee shoos us all back a bit 
so he can have room to work in the sand. he swiftly 
draws a circle and divides it into twelve wedges. it's 
the arena, not rendered in-peeta's precise strokes but 
in the rough lines of a man whose mind is occupied 
by other, far more complex things. "if you were 
brutus and enobaria, knowing what you do now 
about the jungle, where would you feel safest?" beetee 
asks. there's nothing patronizing in his voice, and yet 
i can't help thinking he reminds me of a 
schoolteacher about to ease children into a lesson. 
perhaps it's the age difference, or simply that beetee 
is probably about a million times smarter than the 
rest of us. 

"where we are now. on the beach," says peeta. "it's 
the safest place." 

"so why aren't they on the beach?" says beetee.

we are like schoolchildren. completely unable to

elementary concerns. most of which don't even have 
anything to do with his actual plan. i look at the 
others' disconcerted faces. "why not?" i say. "if it 
fails, there's no harm done. if it works, there's a 
decent chance well kill them. and even if we don't 
and just kill the seafood, brutus and enobaria lose it 
as a food source, too." 

"i say we try it," says peeta. "katniss is right." 

finnick looks at johanna and raises his eyebrows. he 
will not go forward without her. "all right," she says 
finally. "it's better than hunting them down in the 
jungle, anyway. and i doubt they'll figure out our 
plan, since we can barely understand it ourselves."

i finally see beetee's knife with clear eyes. my shaking 
hands slide the wire from the hilt, wind it around the

knot picked up in training. 

i rise, turning to the force field, fully revealing myself 
but no longer caring. only caring about where i

"the others kept peeta alive because if he died, we

haymitch. "and we couldn't risk leaving you

expression unchanged, but he can't hide the tinge of 
gray that colors his face. 

"where is peeta?" i hiss at him. 

"he was picked up by the capitol along with johanna 
and enobaria," says haymitch. and finally he has the 
decency to drop his gaze.
