ow, now, be a good girl, and we’ll 
have you up in no time.” 

“that’s no way to speak to a woman nearly eighty years old just because she’s 

down. i’d have you respect your elders,  young man.” 

“well, missy, excuse me.” doctor harry patted her cheek. “but i’ve got to warm 

you, haven’t i? you’re a marvel, but you must be careful or you’re going to be good 
and sorry.” 

“don’t tell me what i’m going to be. i’m on my feet now, morally speaking. it’s 

cornelia. i had to go to bed to get rid of her.” 

her bones felt loose, and floated around in her skin, and doctor harry floated like 

a balloon around the foot of the bed. 

he floated and pulled down his waistcoat and swung his glasses on a cord. “well, 

stay where you are, it certainly can’t hurt you.” 

“get along and doctor your sick,” said granny weatherall. “leave a well woman 

alone. i’ll call for you when i want you… where were you forty years ago when i pulled 
through mi

lead you on,” she shouted, because doctor harry appeared to float up to the ceiling 
and out. “i pay my own bills, and i don’t throw my money away on nonsense!” 

she meant to wave good-by, but it was too much trouble. her eyes closed of 
themselves, it was like a dark curtain drawn around the bed. the pillow rose and 
floated under her, pleasant as a hammock in a light wind. she listened to the leaves 
rustling outside the window. no, somebody was swishing newspapers: no, cornelia

“she was never like this, never like this!” “well, what can we expect?” “yes,

well, and what if she was? she still had ears. it was like cornelia to whisper 
around doors. she always kept things secret in such a public way. she was always 
being tactful and kind. cornelia was dutiful; that was the trouble with her. dutiful and 
good: “so good and dutiful,” said granny, “that i’d like to spank her.” she saw herself 
spanking cornelia and making a fine job of it. 

“what’d you say, mother?” 

granny felt her face tying up in hard knots. 

“can’t a body think, i’d like to know?” 

“i thought you might want something.” 

“i do. i want a lot of things. first off, go away and don’t whisper.” 

she lay and drowsed, hoping in her sleep

it was lucky too, for she had once for all got 
over the idea of dying for a long time. now she couldn’t be worried. she hoped she 
had better sense now. her father had lived to be one hundred and two years old and 
had drunk a noggin3 of strong hot toddy on his last birthday. he told the reporters it

was his daily habit, and he owed his long life to that. he had made quite a scandal and 
was very pleased about it. she believed she’d just plague cornelia a little. 

“cornelia! cornelia!” no footsteps, but a sudden hand on her cheek. “bless you, 

where have you been?” 

“here, mother.” 

“well, cornelia, i want a noggin of hot toddy.” 

“are you cold, darling?” 

“i’m chilly, cornelia. lying in bed stops the circulation. i must have told you that a 

thousand times.” 

well, she could just hear cornelia telling her husband that mother was getting 

childish and they’d have to humor her. the thing that most annoyed he

r was that 
cornelia thought she was deaf, dumb, and blind. little hasty glances and tiny gestures 
tossed around her and over her head saying, “don’t cross her, let her have her way, 
she’s eighty years old,” and sitting there as if she lived in a thin glass cage. sometimes 
granny almost made up her mind to pack up and move back to her own house where 
nobody could remind her every minute that she was old. wait, wait, cornelia, till your 
own children whisper behind your back! 

in her day she had kept a better house and had got more work done. she wasn’t 

too old yet for lydia to be driving eighty miles for advice when one of the children 
jumped the track, and jimmy still dropped in and talked things over: “now, mammy, 
you’ve a good business head, i want to know what you think of this?…” old cornelia 
couldn’t change the furniture around without asking. little things, little things! they 
had been so

was another thing: sitting up nights with sick horses and sick negroes and sick children 
and hardly ever losing one. john, i hardly ever lost one of them! john would see that in 
a minute, that would be something he could understand, she wouldn’t have to explain 
anything! 

it made her feel like rolling up her sleeves and putting the whole place to rights 
again. no matter if cornelia was determined to be everywhere at once, there were a 
great many things left undone on this place. she would start tomorrow and do them. it 
was good to be strong enough for everything, even if all you made melted and 
changed and slipped under your hands, so that by the time you finished you almost 
forgot what you were working for. what was it i set out to do? she asked herself 
intently, but she could not remember. a fog rose over the valley, she saw it marching 
across the creek swallowing

up to it. her eyelids wavered and let in streamers of blue-gray light like tissue paper 
over her eyes. she must get up and pull the shades down or she’d never sleep. she was 
in bed again and the shades were not down. how could that happen? better turn over, 
hide from the light, sleeping in the light gave you nightmares. “mother, how do you 
feel now?” and a stinging wetness on her forehead. but i don’t like having my face 
washed in cold water! 

hapsy? george? lydia? jimmy? no, cornelia, and her features were swollen and 
full of little puddles. “they’re coming, darling, they’ll all be here soon.” go wash your 
face, child, you look funny. 

instead of obeying, cornelia knelt down and put her head on the pillow. she 

seemed to be talking but there was no sound. 

“well, are you tongue-tied? whose birthday is it? are you going to give a party?” 

cornelia’s mouth moved urgently in strange shapes. “don’t do that, you bother 

me, daughter.” 

“oh, no, moth

nonsense. it was strange about children. they disputed your every word. “no 

what, cornelia?” 

“here’s doctor harry.” 

“i won’t see that boy again. he just left five minutes ago.” 

“that was this morning, mother. it’s night now. here’s the nurse.” 

“this is doctor harry, mrs. weatherall. i never saw you look so young and happy!” 

“ah, i’ll never be young again – but i’d be happy if they’d let me be in peace and 

get rested.” 

she thought she spoke up loudly, but no one answered. a warm weight on her 

forehead, a warm bracelet on her wrist,

once, and there was no surprise in the meeting. then hapsy melted from within and 
turned flimsy as gray gauze and baby was a gauzy shadow, and hapsy came up close 
and said, “i thought you’d never come,” and looked at her very searchingly and said, 
“you haven’t changed a bit!” they leaned forward to kiss, when cornelia began 
whispering from a long way off, “oh, is there anything you want to tell me? is there 
anything i can do for you?” 

yes, she had changed her mind after sixty years and she would like to see george. 

i want you to find george. find him and be sure to tell him i forgot him. i want him to 
know i had my husband just the same and my children and my house like any other 
woman. a good house too and a good husband that i loved and fine children out of 
him. better than i hoped for even. t

k to you.” 

he could speak as much as he pleased. it was like him to drop in and inquire 

about her soul as if it were a teething baby, and then stay on for a cup of tea and a 
round of cards and gossip. he always had a funny story of some sort, usually about an 
irishman who made his little mistakes and confessed them, and the point lay in some 
absurd thing he would blurt out in the confessional showing his struggles between 
native piety and original sin. granny felt easy about her soul. cornelia, where are your 
manners? give father connolly a chair. she had her secret, comfortable understanding 
with a few favorite saints who cleared a straight road to god for her. all as surely 
signed and sealed as the papers for the new forty acres. forever… heirs and assigns 
forever. since the day the wedding cake was not cut, but thrown out and wasted. the

lay a hand on him, for my sake leave something to god. “now, ellen, you must believe 
what i tell you…” 

so there was nothing, nothing to worry about any more, except sometimes in the 
night one of the children screamed in a nightmare, and they both hustled out shaking 
and hunting for the matches and calling, “there, wait a minute, here we are!” john, 
get the doctor now. hapsy’s time has come. but there was hapsy standing by the bed 
in a white cap. 

“cornelia, tell hapsy to take off her cap. i can’t see her plain.” 

her eyes opened very wide and the room stood out like a picture she had seen 

somewhere. dark colors with the shadows rising towards the ceiling in long angles. the 
tall black dresser gleamed with nothing on it but john’s picture, enlarged from a little 
one, with john’s eyes very black when they should have been blue. you never saw him, 
so how do you know how he looked? but the man insisted the copy was perfect, it was

 rich and handsome. for a picture, yes, but it’s not my husband. the table by the 
bed had a linen cover and a candle and a crucifix. the light was blue from cornelia’s 
silk lampshades. no sort of light at all, just frippery.4 you had to live forty years with 
kerosene lamps to appreciate honest electricity. she felt very strong and she saw 
doctor harry with a rosy nimbus around him. 

“you look like a saint, doctor harry, and i vow that’s as near as you’ll ever dome 

to it.” 

“she’s saying something.” 

“i heard you, cornelia. what’s all this carrying-on?” 

“father connolly’s saying –“

light flashed on her closed eyelids, and a deep roaring shook her. cornelia, is that 

lightning? i hear thunder. there’s going to be a storm. close all the windows. call the 
children in... “mother, where we are, all of us.” “is that you, hapsy?” “oh, no, i’m 
lydia. we drove as fast as we could.” their faces drifted above her, drifted away. the 
rosary fell out of her hands and lydia put it back. jimmy tried to help, their hands 
fumbled together, and granny closed two fingers around jimmy’s thumb. beads 
wouldn’t do it, it must be something alive

. she was so amazed her thoughts ran round 
and round. so, my dear lord, this is my death and i wasn’t even thinking about it. my 
children have come to see me die. but i can’t, it’s not time. oh, i always hated 
surprises. i wanted to give cornelia the amethyst set – cornelia, you’re to have the 
amethyst set, but hapsy’ to wear it when she wants, and, doctor harry, do shut up. 
nobody sent for you. oh, my dear lord, do wait a minute. i meant to do something 
about the forty acres, jimmy doesn’t need it and lydia will later on, with that 
worthless husband of hers. i meant to finish the altar cloth and send six bottles of wine 
to sister borgia for her dyspepsia. i want to send six bottles of wine to sister borgia, 
father connolly, now don’t let me forget.

cornelia’s voice made short turns and tilted over and crashed. “oh, mother, oh, 
mother, oh, mother…” 

“i’m not going cornelia. i’m taken by surprise. i can’t go.” 

you’ll see hapsy again. what about her? “i thought you’d never come.” granny 

made a long journey outward, looking for hapsy. what if i don’t find her? what then? 
her heart sank down and down, there was no bottom to death, she couldn’t come to 
the end of it. the blue light from cornelia’s lampshade drew into a tiny point in the 
center of her brain, it flickered and winked like an eye, quietly it fluttered and 
dwindled. granny lay curled down within herself, amazed and watchful, staring at the 
point of light that was herself; her body was now only a deeper mass of shadow in an 
endless darkness and this darkness would curl around the light and swallow it up. god, 
give me a sign! 

for the second time there was no sign. again no bridegroom and the priest in the 

house. sh
