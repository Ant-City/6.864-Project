county that everybody knew that they had murdered and burned him up in his cabin.
they called themselves grumby's independents--about fifty or sixty of them that wore no
uniform and came from nobody knew where as soon as the last yankee regiment was out
of the country, raiding smokehouses and stables, and houses where they were sure there
were no men, tearing up beds and floors and walls, frightening white women and torturing
negroes to find where money or silver was hidden.

that these were southern men and, therefore, there would not even be any risk to this,

i sat there and looked at the horses and i believed that ab snopes was grumby. but uncle

camp without any roof to get under and we had to use the stick to start a fire, because of
uncle buck's arm. and so, when we came to where we could get another pine stick, we
couldn't remember whether it had been five or six or ten days, and so ringo didn't start
another. because he said he would fix the stick up the day we got grumby and that it

uncle buck told them that we didn't need any help; that three was enough to catch
grumby.

so then it was too late; we just sat there, with the stranger facing us across the fire
with the mare's reins in his little still hand, looking at the three of us from between his hat
and his beard. "ab snopes," he said. "i don't believe i

"not exactly," uncle buck said. "you see, we done got a little alabama grumby

about killing women and children." he and the stranger looked at each other. "maybe it's
the wrong season for women and children. or maybe it's public opinion, now that grumby
is what you might call a public character. folks hereabouts is got used to having their
menfolks killed and even shot from behind. but even the yankees never got them used to
the other. and evidently somebody has done reminded grumby of this. ain't that correct?"

they looked at each other; they didn't move. "but you are neither a woman nor a

turned and put the reins over the mare's head. "i reckon i'

have killed him if they hadn't heard us coming and run away; only his eyes were not
hollering. they were watching us, going fast and quick from ringo to me to uncle buck,
and then at ringo and me again, and they were not hollering, like his eyes belonged to
one man and his gaped and yelling mouth belonged to another.

it was like we might have stopped and built a fire and thawed out that moccasin--
just enough for it to find out where it was, but not enough for it to know what to do about
it. only i reckon it was a high compliment to set ab snopes up with a moccasin, even a
little one. i reckon it was bad for him. i reckon he realised that they had thrown him back
to us without mercy, and that if he tried to save himself from us at their expense, they

when we lost count of time, because one morning we came to a fire still burning and a
hog they had not even had time to butcher; and sometimes we would ride all night,
swapping mules when we had guessed that it had been two hours; and so, sometimes it
would be night when we slept and sometimes it would be daylight, and we knew that they
must have watched us from somewhere every day and that now that uncle buck was not
with us, they didn't even dare to stop and try to hide.

didn't look at the other man, bridger, he just said, "all right. ease off. but watch him. he's too
tender hearted to turn your back on." they backed the horses away, side by side, the two
pistols trained on grumby's belly, until they reached the underbrush. "we're going to texas.

remember that texas is a wide place, and use that knowledge. ride!" he shouted.

bushes, cursing. he shot three times toward the fading sound of the horses, then he whirled

for the first time, so slow and careful it was that he passed it from his right to his left hand
and let it hang again, pointing down again. "well, well, well. sholy i ain't forgot how to
count as well as how to shoot." there was a bird somewhere--a yellowhammer--i had been
hearing it all the time; even the three shots hadn't frightened it. and i could hear ringo,
too, making a kind of whimpering sound when he breathed, and it was like i wasn't trying
to watch grumby so much as to keep from looking at ringo. "well, she's safe enough now,

sweat and wood smoke and grease--and i could hear him, and then i could hear my arm

grumby bucked ringo off just like a steer would and whirled again, looking at us,
crouched, with his mouth open too; and then my arm began to come up with the pistol
and he turned and ran. he shouldn't have tried to run from us in boots. or maybe that
made no difference either, because now my arm had come up and now i could see
grumby's back (he didn't scream, he never made a sound) and the pistol both at the
same time and the pistol was level and steady as a rock.

 and part of the night to reach the old compress. but it didn't
take very long to ride home because we went fast with the two mounts apiece to change
to, and what we had to carry now, wrapped in a piece of the skirt of grumby's coat, didn't
weigh anything.

rode past the brick piles and the sooty walls that hadn't fallen down yet, and went on
through what used to be the square. we hitched the mules in the cedars and ringo was
just starting off to find a board when we saw that somebody had already put one up--mrs.

piece of wire.

drusilla was either.

even one young girl who had happened to try to look and act like a man after her
sweetheart was killed.

so then the next letter came. only granny wasn't there to read it because she was
dead then (it was the time when grumby doubled back past jefferson and so ringo and i
spent one night at home and found the letter when mrs. compson had sent it out) and so
for a while ringo and i couldn't make out what aunt louisa was trying to tell us. this one
was on the same wallpaper too, six pages this time, only aunt louisa hadn't cried in the
pokeberry juice this time: ringo said because she must have been writing too fast:

we went on to the kitchen, professor wilkins still somewhere beside or behind me
and still offering me the pistol and horse in a dozen different ways. ringo was waiting; i
remember how i thought then that no matter what might happen to either of us, i would
never be the sartoris to him. he was twenty-four too, but in a way he had changed even
less than i had since that day when we had nailed grumby's body to the door of the old
compress. maybe it was because he had outgrown me, had changed so much that
summer while he and granny traded mules with the yankees that since then i had had to
do most of the changing just to catch up with him. he was sitting quietly in a chair beside
the cold stove, spent-looking too who had ridden forty miles (at one time, either in
jefferson or when he was alone at last on the road somewhere, he had cried; dust was

more than should be required of children because there should be some limit to the age,
the youth at least below which one should not have to kill. this was just after the saturday
night when he returned and i watched him clean the derringer and reload it and we

drusilla and i walked in the garden in the twilight and i said something about what george

worse things than killing men, bayard. there are worse things than being killed. sometimes i
think the finest thing that can happen to a man is to love something, a woman preferably,
well, hard hard hard, then to die young because he believed what he could not help but
believe and was what he could not (could not? would not) help but be." now she was
looking at me in a way she never had before. i did not know what it meant then and was
not to know until tonight since neither of us knew then

smoke from a cigar. then george wyatt was beside me (i don't know where he came

e been the same as if he had never said it. so we did not speak; i just
walked steadily toward him as the pistol rose from the desk. i watched it, i could see the
foreshortened slant of the barrel and i knew it would miss me though his hand did not
tremble. i walked toward him, toward the pistol in the rock-like hand, i heard no bullet.
maybe i didn't even hear the explosion though i remember the sudden orange bloom and
smoke as they appeared against his white shirt as they had appeared against grumby's
greasy confederate coat; i still watched that foreshortened slant of barrel which i knew
was not aimed at me and saw the second orange flash and smoke and heard no bullet
that time either. then i stopped; it was done then. i watched the pistol descend to the
desk in short jerks; i saw him release it and sit back, both hands on the desk, i looked at his
face and i knew too what it was to want air when there was nothing in the
circumambience for the lungs. he rose, shoved the chair back with a
