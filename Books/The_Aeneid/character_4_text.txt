  the tyrian queen stood fix'd upon his face,
  pleas'd with his motions, ravish'd with his grace;
  admir'd his fortunes, more admir'd the man;
  then recollected stood, and thus began:
  "what fate, o goddess-born; what angry pow'rs
  have cast you shipwrack'd on our barren shores?
  are you the great aeneas, known to fame,
  who from celestial seed your lineage claim?

  the same aeneas whom fair venus bore
  to fam'd anchises on th' idaean shore?
  it calls into my mind, tho' then a child,
  when teucer came, from salamis exil'd,
  and sought my father's aid, to be restor'd:
  my father belus then with fire and sword
  invaded cyprus, made the region bare,
  and, conqu'ring, finish'd the successful war.
  from him the trojan siege i understood,
  the grecian chiefs, and your illustrious blood.
  your foe himself the dardan valor prais'd,
  and his own ancestry from trojans rais'd.

  to their united force it yields, tho' late,
  and mourns with mortal groans th' approaching fate:
  the roots no more their upper load sustain;
  but down she falls, and spreads a ruin thro' the plain.

  "descending thence, i scape thro' foes and fire:

  strange to relate, from young iulus' head

  'if any vows, almighty jove, can bend
  thy will; if piety can pray'rs commend,
  confirm the glad presage which thou art pleas'd to send.'
  scarce had he said, when, on our left, we hear
  a peal of rattling thunder roll in air:

  to seek in foreign lands a happier seat.
  near old antandros, and at ida's foot,
  the timber of the sacred groves we cut,
  and build our fleet; uncertain yet to find
  what place the gods for our repose assign'd.
  friends daily flock; and scarce the kindly spring
  began to clothe the ground, and birds to sing,
  when old anchises summon'd all to sea:
  the crew my father and the fates obey.
  with sighs and tears i leave my native shore,
  and empty fields, where ilium stood before.
  my sire, my son, our less and greater gods,
  all sail at once, and cleave the briny floods.

  "against our coast appears a spacious land,
  which once the fierce lycurgus did command,

  she said, and to the neighb'ring forest flew.
  our courage fails us, and our fears renew.
  hopeless to win by war, to pray'rs we fall,
  and on th' offended harpies humbly call,
  and whether gods or birds obscene they were,
  our vows for pardon and for peace prefer.
  but old anchises, off'ring sacrifice,
  and lifting up to heav'n his hands and eyes,
  ador'd the greater gods: 'avert,' said he,
  'these omens; render vain this prophecy,
  and from th' impending curse a pious people free!'

  "thus having said, he bids us put to sea;
  we loose from shore our haulsers, and obey,
  and soon with swelling sails pursue the wat'ry way.

  then, when he saw no threat'ning tempest nigh,

  he gave the sign to weigh; we break our sleep,

  "and now the rising morn with rosy light
  adorns the skies, and puts the stars to flight;
  when we from far, like bluish mists, descry

  achates first pronounc'd the joyful sound;
  then, 'italy!' the cheerful crew rebound.
  my sire anchises crown'd a cup with wine,
  and, off'ring, thus implor'd the pow'rs divine:
  'ye gods, presiding over lands and seas,
  and you who raging winds and waves appease,
  breathe on our swelling sails a prosp'rous wind,
  and smooth our passage to the port assign'd!'
  the gentle gales their flagging force renew,
  and now the happy harbor is in view.

  he said, and on his knees my knees embrac'd:

  as often as the night obscures the skies
  with humid shades, or twinkling stars arise,
  anchises' angry ghost in dreams appears,

  he said, and first his brows with myrtle bound.
  then helymus, by his example led,
  and old acestes, each adorn'd his head;
  thus young ascanius, with a sprightly grace,
  his temples tied, and all the trojan race.
   aeneas then advanc'd amidst the train,
  by thousands follow'd thro' the flow'ry plain,
  to great anchises' tomb; which when he found,
  he pour'd to bacchus, on the hallow'd ground,
  two bowls of sparkling wine, of milk two more,
  and two (from offer'd bulls) of purple gore,
  with roses then the sepulcher he strow'd
  and thus his father's ghost bespoke aloud:
  "hail, o ye holy manes! hail again,
  paternal ashes, now review'd in vain!
  the gods permitted not, that you, with me,
  should reach the promis'd shores of italy,
  or tiber's flood, what flood soe'er it be."

  the pious prince, surpris'd at what he view'd,
  the fun'ral honors with more zeal renew'd,
  doubtful if this place's genius were,
  or guardian of his father's sepulcher.
  five sheep, according to the rites, he slew;
  as many swine, and steers of sable hue;
  new gen'rous wine he from the goblets pour'd.
  and call'd his father's ghost, from hell restor'd.
  the glad attendants in long order come,
  off'ring their gifts at great anchises' tomb:
  some add more oxen: some divide the spoil;
  some place the chargers on the grassy soil;
  some blow the fires, and offered entrails broil.

  now came the day desir'd. the skies were bright
  with rosy luster of the rising light:
  the bord'ring people, rous'd by sounding fame
  of trojan feasts and great acestes' name,
  the crowded shore with acclamations fill,
  part to behold, and part to prove their skill.

  swiftly fair iris down her arch descends,
  and, undiscern'd, her fatal voyage ends.
  she saw the gath'ring crowd; and, gliding thence,
  the desart shore, and fleet without defense.
  the trojan matrons, on the sands alone,
  with sighs and tears anchises' death bemoan;
  then, turning to the sea their weeping eyes,
  their pity to themselves renews their cries.
  "alas!" said one, "what oceans yet remain
  for us to sail! what labors to sustain!"
  all take the word, and, with a gen'ral groan,

  then from the south arose a gentle breeze
  that curl'd the smoothness of the glassy seas;

  not less than theirs from jove my lineage came;
  my mother greater, my descent the same."
  so pray'd the trojan prince, and, while he pray'd,
  his hand upon the holy altar laid.

  then thus replied the prophetess divine:
  "o goddess-born of great anchises' line,
  the gates of hell are open night and day;
  smooth the descent, and easy is the way:
  but to return, and view the cheerful skies,
  in this the task and mighty labor lies.

  such, and so thick, the shiv'ring army stands,
  and press for passage with extended hands.
  now these, now those, the surly boatman bore:
  the rest he drove to distance from the shore.
  the hero, who beheld with wond'ring eyes
  the tumult mix'd with shrieks, laments, and cries,
  ask'd of his guide, what the rude concourse meant;
  why to the shore the thronging people bent;
  what forms of law among the ghosts were us'd;
  why some were ferried o'er, and some refus'd.

  "son of anchises, offspring of the gods,"
  the sibyl said, "you see the stygian floods,
  the sacred stream which heav'n's imperial state
  attests in oaths, and fears to violate.
  the ghosts rejected are th' unhappy crew
  depriv'd of sepulchers and fun'ral due:
  the boatman, charon; those, the buried host,
  he ferries over to the farther coast;
  nor dares his transport vessel cross the waves
  with such whose bones are not compos'd in graves.

  the heads of these with holy fillets bound,
  and all their temples were with garlands crown'd.

  to these the sibyl thus her speech address'd,
  and first to him surrounded by the rest
  (tow'ring his height, and ample was his breast):
  "say, happy souls, divine musaeus, say,
  where lives anchises, and where lies our way
  to find the hero, for whose only sake
  we sought the dark abodes, and cross'd the bitter lake?"
  to this the sacred poet thus replied:
  "in no fix'd place the happy souls reside.
  in groves we live, and lie on mossy beds,
  by crystal streams, that murmur thro' the meads:
  but pass yon easy hill, and thence descend;
  the path conducts you to your journey's end."
  this said, he led them up the mountain's brow,
  and shews them all the shining fields below.

  but old anchises, in a flow'ry vale,
  review'd his muster'd race, and took the tale:
  those happy spirits, which, ordain'd by fate,
  for future beings and new bodies wait-
  with studious thought observ'd th' illustrious throng,
  in nature's order as they pass'd along:
  their names, their fates, their conduct, and their care,
  in peaceful senates and successful war.
  he, when aeneas on the plain appears,
  meets him with open arms, and falling tears.
  "welcome," he said, "the gods' undoubted race!

  in lethe's lake they long oblivion taste,
  of future life secure, forgetful of the past.
  long has my soul desir'd this time and place,

  that this presaging joy may fire your mind
  to seek the shores by destiny design'd."-
  "o father, can it be, that souls sublime
  return to visit our terrestrial clime,
  and that the gen'rous mind, releas'd by death,
  can covet lazy limbs and mortal breath?"

  anchises then, in order, thus begun
  to clear those wonders to his godlike son:
  "know, first, that heav'n, and earth's compacted frame,
  and flowing waters, and the starry flame,
  and both the radiant lights, one common soul
  inspires and feeds, and animates the whole.
  this active mind, infus'd thro' all the space,
  unites and mingles with the mighty mass.
  hence men and beasts the breath of life obtain,
  and birds of air, and monsters of the main.

  thus having said, he led the hero round
  the confines of the blest elysian ground;
  which when anchises to his son had shown,
  and fir'd his mind to mount the promis'd throne,
  he tells the future wars, ordain'd by fate;
  the strength and customs of the latian state;
  the prince, and people; and forearms his care
  with rules, to push his fortune, or to bear.

  the speech had omen, that the trojan race
  should find repose, and this the time and place.
  aeneas took the word, and thus replies,
  confessing fate with wonder in his eyes:
  "all hail, o earth! all hail, my household gods!
  behold the destin'd place of your abodes!
  for thus anchises prophesied of old,
  and this our fatal place of rest foretold:
  'when, on a foreign shore, instead of meat,
  by famine forc'd, your trenchers you shall eat,
  then ease your weary trojans will attend,
  and the long labors of your voyage end.
  remember on that happy coast to build,
  and with a trench inclose the fruitful field.'
  this was that famine, this the fatal place
  which ends the wand'ring of our exil'd race.

  enjoy the present hour; adjourn the future thought."

  thus having said, the hero bound his brows
  with leafy branches, then perform'd his vows;
  adoring first the genius of the place,
  then earth, the mother of the heav'nly race,
  the nymphs, and native godheads yet unknown,
  and night, and all the stars that gild her sable throne,
  and ancient cybel, and idaean jove,

  thus while he spoke, latinus roll'd around
  his eyes, and fix'd a while upon the ground.
  intent he seem'd, and anxious in his breast;
  not by the scepter mov'd, or kingly vest,
  but pond'ring future things of wondrous weight;

  he said; and while spoke, with piercing eyes
  evander view'd the man with vast surprise,
  pleas'd with his action, ravish'd with his face:
  then answer'd briefly, with a royal grace:
  "o valiant leader of the trojan line,

  long tho' it be, 't is fresh within my mind,

  and thro' th' arcadian kingdom took his way.

  to shade my chin, and call me first a man.

  troy is too narrow for thy name." he said,
  and plunging downward shot his radiant head;
  dispell'd the breathing air, that broke his flight:
  shorn of his beams, a man to mortal sight.
  old butes' form he took, anchises' squire,
  now left, to rule ascanius, by his sire:
  his wrinkled visage, and his hoary hairs,
  his mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears,
  and thus salutes the boy, too forward for his years:
  "suffice it thee, thy father's worthy son,
  the warlike prize thou hast already won.
  the god of archers gives thy youth a part
  of his own praise, nor envies equal art.
