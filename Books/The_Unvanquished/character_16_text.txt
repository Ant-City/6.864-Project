"what did you see? what are they doing?"

it was the way she stood and walked. she had on pants, like a man. she was the best
woman rider in the country. when granny and i were here that christmas before the war
and gavin breckbridge had just given bobolink to her, they looked fine together; it didn't
need jingus to say that they were the finest-looking couple in alabama or mississippi either.
