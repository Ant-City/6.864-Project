ds away, at the bottom of the slope, ran the brook, no more than
three feet wide, half choked with kingcups, watercress and blue brooklime. the
cart track crossed by a brick culvert and climbed the opposite slope to a five-
barred gate in the thorn hedge. the gate led into the lane.
     the may sunset was red in clouds, and there was still half an hour to twilight.
the dry slope was dotted with rabbits -- some nibbling at the thin grass near their
holes, others pushing further down to look for dandelions or perhaps a cowslip
that the rest had missed. here and there one sat upright on an ant heap and
looked about, with ears erect and nose in the wind. but a blackbird, singing
undisturbed on the outskirts of the wood, showed that there was nothing
alarming there, and in the other direction, along the brook, all was plain to be
seen, empty and quiet. the warren was at peace.
     at the top of the bank, close to the wild cherry where the blackbird sang, was a
little group of holes almost hidden b

 your advice,
did you? what were you expecting?"
     it was evening once more and hazel and fiver were feeding outside the wood
with two friends. blackberry, the rabbit with tipped ears who had been startled by
fiver the night before, had listened carefully to hazel's description of the notice
board, remarking that he had always felt sure that men left these things about to
act as signs or messages of some kind, in the same way that rabbits left marks on
runs and gaps. it was another neighbor, dandelion, who had now brought the
talk back to the threarah and his indifference to fiver's fear.
     "i don't know what i expected," said hazel. "i'd never been near the chief
rabbit before. but i thought, 'well, even if he won't listen, at least no one can say
afterward that we didn't do our best to warn him.'"
     "you're sure, then, that there's really something to be afraid of?"
     "i'm quite certain. i've always known fiver, you see."
     blackberry was about to reply when another rabbit came

  "no one will steal lettuces soon," said fiver quietly.

     "oh, that's you, fiver, is it?" said bigwig, noticing him for the first time. "good,
i was coming to look for you. i've been thinking about what you said to the chief
rabbit. tell me, is it a sort of tremendous hoax to make yourself important, or is
it true?"
     "it is true," said fiver. "i wish it weren't."
     "then you'll be leaving the warren?"
     they were all startled by the bluntness with which bigwig went to the point.
dandelion muttered, "leave the warren, frithrah!" while blackberry twitched his
ears and looked very intently, first at bigwig and then at hazel.
     it was hazel who replied. "fiver and i will be leaving the warren tonight," he
said deliberately. "i don't know exactly where we shall go, but we'll take anyone
who's ready to come with us."
     "right," said bigwig, "then you can take me."
     the last thing hazel had expected was the immediate support of a member of
the owsla. it crossed his mind that

     it was actually about an hour after moonrise and a good while before midnight
when hazel and fiver once more came out of their burrow behind the brambles
and slipped quietly along the bottom of the ditch. with them was a third rabbit,
hlao -- pipkin -- a friend of fiver. (hlao means any small concavity in the grass
where moisture may collect -- e.g., the dimple formed by a dandelion or thistle
cup.) he too was small, and inclined to be timid, and hazel and fiver had spent
the greater part of their last evening in the warren in persuading him to join
them. pipkin had agreed rather hesitantly. he still felt extremely nervous about
what might happen once they left the warren, and had decided that the best way
to avoid trouble would be to keep close to hazel and do exactly what he said.
     the three were still in the ditch when hazel heard a movement above. he
looked up quic

     "who's there?" he said. "dandelion?"
     "no, i'm hawkbit," said the rabbit who was peering over the edge. he jumped
down among them, landing rather heavily. "do you remember me, hazel? we

were in the same burrow during the snow last winter. dandelion told me you
were going to leave the warren tonight. if you are, i'll come with you."
     hazel could recall hawkbit -- a rather slow, stupid rabbit whose company for
five snowbound days underground had been distinctly tedious. still, he thought,
this was no time to pick and choose. although bigwig might succeed in talking
over one or two, most of the rabbits they could expect to join them would not
come from the owsla. they would be outskirters who were getting a thin time
and wondering what t

o do about it. he was running over some of these in his
mind when dandelion appeared.
     "the sooner we're off the better, i reckon," said dandelion. "i don't much like
the look of things. after i'd persuaded hawkbit here to join us, i was just starting
to talk to a few more, when i found that toadflax fellow had followed me down
the run. 'i want to know what you're up to,' he said, and i don't think he believed
me when i told him i was only trying to find out whether there were any rabbits

a comrade. you're both to come with me."
     immediately bigwig fell upon him, scratching and kicking. holly fought back.
his followers closed in, looking for an opening to join the fight and pin bigwig
down. suddenly, from the top of the bank, buckthorn flung himself headlong into
the scuffle, knocked one of the guards flying with a kick from his back legs and
then closed with the other. he was followed a moment later by dandelion, who
landed full on the rabbit whom buckthorn had kicked. both guards broke clear,
looked round for a moment and then leaped up the bank into the wood. holly
struggled free of bigwig and crouched on his haunches, scuffling his front paws
and growling, as rabbits will when angry. he was about to speak when hazel
faced him.

     "go," said hazel, firmly and quietly, "or we'll kill you."
     "do you know what this means?" replied holly. "i am captain of owsla. you
know that, don't you?"
     "g

o," repeated hazel, "or you will be killed."
     "it is you who will be killed," replied holly. without another word he, too,
went back up the bank and vanished into the wood.
     dandelion was bleeding from the shoulder. he licked the wound for a few
moments and then turned to hazel.
     "they won't be long coming back, you know, hazel," he said. "they've gone to
turn out the owsla, and then we'll be for it right enough."
     "we ought to go at once," said fiver.
     "yes, the time's come now, all right," replied hazel. "come on, down to the
stream. then we'll follow the bank -- that'll help us to keep together."
     "if you'll take my advice--" began bigwig.

seemed thicker, older and
more yellow.
     from a thick pile of dead leaves beneath a holly tree, hazel looked down a
narrow path lined on either side with fern and sprouting fireweed. the fern
moved slightly in the breeze, but along the path there was nothing to be seen
except a scatter of last year's fallen acorns under an oak. what was in the
bracken? what lay round the further bend? and what would happen to a rabbit
who left the shelter of the holly tree and ran down the path? he turned to
dandelion beside him.
     "you'd better wait here," he said. "when i get to the bend i'll stamp. but if i
run into trouble, get the others away."
     without waiting for an answer, he ran into the open and down the path. a few
seconds brought him to the oak. he paused a moment, staring about him, and
then ran on to the bend. beyond, the path was the same -- empty in the darkening
moonlight and leading gently downhill into the deep shadow of a grove of ilex
trees. hazel stamped, and a few moments later

dandelion was beside him in the
bracken. even in the midst of his fear and strain it occurred to him that
dandelion must be very fast: he had covered the distance in a flash.
     "well done," whispered dandelion. "running our risks for us, are you -- like
el-ahrairah?"*
     hazel gave him a quick, friendly glance. it was warm praise and cheered him.
what robin hood is to the english and john henry to the american negroes,
elil-hrair-rah, or el-ahrairah -- the prince with a thousand enemies -- is to
rabbits. uncle remus might well have heard of him, for some of el-ahrairah's
adventures are those of brer rabbit. for that matter, odysseus himself might

ful, but very weary. hazel realized that until they were rested they
would all be safer where they were than stumbling along in the open with no
strength left to run from an enemy. but if they lay brooding, unable to feed or go
underground, all their troubles would come crowding into their hearts, their fears
would mount and they might very likely scatter, or even try to return to the
warren. he had an idea.
     "yes, all right, we'll rest here," he said, "let's go in among this fern. come on,
dandelion, tell us a story. i know you're handy that way. pipkin here can't wait to
hear it."
     dandelion looked at pipkin and realized what it was that hazel was asking him
to do. choking back his own fear of the desolate, grassless woodland, the before-
dawn-returning owls that they could hear some way off, and the extraordinary,
rank animal smell that seemed to come from somewhere rather nearer, he began.

     *the stresses are the same as in the phrase "never say die."

he sparrow and the kestrel were friends and
they both ate seeds and flies. and the fox and the rabbit were friends and they
both ate grass. and there was plenty of grass and plenty of flies, because the
world was new and frith shone down bright and warm all day.
     "now, el-ahrairah was among the animals in those days and he had many
wives. he had so many wives that there was no counting them, and the wives had
so many young that even frith could not count them, and they ate the grass and
the dandelions and the lettuces and the clover, and el-ahrairah was the father of
them all." (bigwig growled appreciatively.) "and after a time," went on
dandelion, "after a time the grass began to grow thin and the rabbits wandered
everywhere, multiplying and eating as they went.
     "then frith said to el-ahrairah, 'prince rabbit, if you cannot control your
people, i shall find ways to control them. so mark what i say.' but el-ahrairah
would not listen and he said to frith, 'my people are the strongest in

 that hole and i will bless you instead of him.' 'no, i cannot,' said el-
ahrairah, 'i am busy. the fox and the weasel are coming. if you want to bless me
you can bless my bottom, for it is sticking out of the hole.'"
     all the rabbits had heard the story before: on winter nights, when the cold
draft moved down the warren passages and the icy wet lay in the pits of the runs
below their burrows; and on summer evenings, in the grass under the red may
and the sweet, carrion-scented elder bloom. dandelion was telling it well, and
even pipkin forgot his weariness and danger and remembered instead the great
indestructibility of the rabbits. each one of them saw himself as el-ahrairah, who
could be impudent to frith and get away with it.
     "then," said dandelion, "frith felt himself in friendship with el-ahrairah, who
would not give up even when he thought the fox and the weasel were coming. and
he said, 'very well, i will bless your bottom as it sticks out of the hole. bottom, be

     as dandelion ended, acorn, who was on the windward side of the little group,
suddenly started and sat back, with ears up and nostrils twitching. the strange,
rank smell was stronger than ever and after a few moments they all heard a heavy
movement close by. suddenly, on the other side of the path, the fern parted and
there looked out a long, dog-like head, striped black and white. it was pointed
downward, the jaws grinning, the muzzle close to the ground. behind, they could
just discern great, powerful paws

immering white as the stripes along the head. for long moments it gazed and
the rabbits remained motionless, staring back without a sound. then bigwig, who
was nearest to the path, turned and slipped back among the others.
     "a lendri," he muttered as he passed through them. "it may be dangerous and
it may not, but i'm taking no chances with it. let's get away."
     they followed him through the fern and very soon came upon another, parallel
path. bigwig turned into it and broke into a run. dandelion overtook him and the
two disappeared among the ilex trees. hazel and the others followed as best they
could, with pipkin limping and staggering behind, his fear driving him on in spite
of the pain in his paw.
     hazel came out on the further side of the ilexes and followed the path round a
bend. then he stopped dead and sat back on his haunches. immediately in front
of him, bigwig and dandelion were staring out from the sheer edge of a high
bank, and below the bank ran a stream. it was in fac

     no one obeyed him. all squatted, puzzled and uncertain. blackberry buried his

the board tipped. pipkin squealed and fiver lowered his head and splayed his
claws. then the board righted itself and drifted out a few feet into the pool with
the two rabbits hunched upon it, rigid and motionless. it rotated slowly and they
found themselves staring back at their comrades.
     "frith and inlé!" said dandelion. "they're sitting on the water! why don't they
sink?"
     "they're sitting on the wood and the wood floats, can't you see?" said
blackberry. "now we swim over ourselves. can we start, hazel?"
     during the last few minutes hazel had been as near to losing his head as he
was ever to come. he had been at his wits' end, with no reply to bigwig's scornful
impatience except his readiness to risk his own life in company with fiver and
pipkin. he still could not understand what had happened, but at

 least he realized
that blackberry wanted him to show authority. his head cleared.
     "swim," he said. "everybody swim."
     he watched them as they went in. dandelion swam as well as he ran, swiftly
and easily. silver, too, was strong. the others paddled and scrambled over

somehow, and as they began to reach the other side, hazel plunged. the cold
water penetrated his fur almost at once. his breath came short and as his head
went under he could hear a faint grating of gravel along the bottom. he paddled
across awkwardly, his head tilted high out of the water, and made for the figwort.
as he pulled himself out, he looked round among the sopping rabbits in t

reek of
cattle dung, he became fully aware of what had already been drifting into his
nostrils while he was lying among the thorn. there was only one smell on the
wind and it was new to him: a strong, fresh, sweet fragrance that filled the air. it
was healthy enough. there was no harm in it. but what was it and why was it so
strong? how could it exclude every other smell, in open country on a south wind?
the source must be close by. hazel wondered whether to send one of the rabbits
to find out. dandelion would be over the top and back almost as fast as a hare.
then his sense of adventure and mischief prompted him. he would go himself
and bring back some news before they even knew that he had gone. that would
give bigwig something to bite on.
     he ran easily up the meadow toward the cows. as he came they raised their
heads and gazed at him, all together, for a moment, before returning to their
feeding. a great black bird was flapping and hopping a little way behind the herd.

ment of the leaves. far along the bean row hazel glimpsed
buckthorn's back and followed him into the depths of the field.
     soon after, all the rabbits had come together in a kind of hollow. far around,
on all sides, stood the orderly rows of beans, securing them against hostile
approach, roofing them over and covering their scent. they could hardly have
been safer underground. even a little food could be had at a pinch, for here and
there were a few pale twists of grass and here and there a dandelion.
     "we can sleep here all day," said hazel. "but i suppose one of us ought to stay
awake; and if i take the first turn it'll give me a chance to have a look at your paw,
hlao-roo. i think you've got something in it."
     pipkin, who was lying on his left side, breathing quickly and heavily, rolled
over and stretched out his front paw, underside turned upward. hazel peered
closely into the thick, coarse hair (a rabbit's foot has no pads) and after a few
moments saw what he had expected -- th

there are too few of us for giving orders and biting people. frith in a fog! isn't
there enough trouble and danger already?"
     they went over to the far end of the pit. bigwig and silver were talking with
buckthorn under an overhanging broom. nearby, pipkin and dandelion were
pretending to feed on a patch of scrub. some way away, acorn was making a great

business of licking hawkbit's throat, while speedwell watched.
     "keep still if you can, poor old chap," said acorn, who obviously wanted to be
overheard. "just let me clean the blood out. steady, now!" hawkbit winced in an
exaggerated manner and backed away. as hazel came up, all the rabbits turned
and stared at him expectantly.
     "look," said hazel, "i know there's been some trouble, but the best thin

be to try to forget it. this is a bad place, but we'll soon get out of it."
     "do you really think we will?" asked dandelion.
     "if you'll follow me now," replied hazel desperately, "i'll have you out of it by
sunrise."
     "if i don't," he thought, "they'll very likely tear me to bits, and much good may
it do them."
     for the second time he made his way out of the pit, and the others followed.

it disappeared over the heather; and although he waited motionless for some
time, it did not return. once dandelion struck the smell of a stoat and they all
joined him, whispering and sniffing over the ground. but the scent was old and
after a time they went on again. in this low undergrowth their disorganized
progress and uneven, differing rhythms of movement delayed them still more
than in the wood. there were continual stampings of alarm, pausing, freezing to
the spot at the sound of movement real or imagined. it was so dark that hazel
seldom knew for certain whether he was leading or whether bigwig or si

frithrah, you're what i call a chief rabbit!"
     "well done, hazel!" said buckthorn. "well done!"
     hazel did not know what to reply. he looked at them in silence and it was
acorn who spoke next.
     "come on!" he said. "who's going to be first into that field? i can still run." he
was off, slowly enough, down the slope, but when hazel stamped for him to stop
he did so at once.
     "where are the others?" said hazel. "dandelion? bigwig?"
     at that moment dandelion appeared out of the heather and sat on the path,
looking at the field. he was followed first by hawkbit and then by fiver. hazel
was watching fiver as he took in the sight of the field, when buckthorn drew his
attention back to the foot of the slope.
     "look, hazel," he said, "silver and bigwig are down there. they're waiting for
us."
     silver's light-gray fur showed up plainly against a low spray of gorse, but hazel
could not see bigwig until he sa

jumped over the little brook that ran down the middle of the field and when
acorn tried to follow him and fell short, silver joked with him as he scrambled
out and rolled him in a patch of dead oak leaves until he was dry. as the sun rose
higher, shortening the shadows and drawing the dew from the grass, most of the
rabbits came wandering back to the sun-flecked shade among the cow parsley
along the edge of the ditch. here, hazel and fiver were sitting with dandelion
under a flowering wild cherry. the white petals spun down around them,
covering the grass and speckling their fur, while thirty feet above a thrush sang,
"cherry dew, cherry dew. knee deep, knee deep, knee deep."
     "well, this is the place all right, isn't it, hazel?" said dandelion lazily. "i
suppose we'd better start having a look along the banks soon, although i must say
i'm in no particular hurry. but i've got an idea it may be going to rain before
much longer."

gh he were about to speak, but then shook his ears and
turned to nibbling at a dandelion.
     "that looks a good bank, along the edge of the trees up there," answered hazel.
"what do you say, fiver? shall we go up there now or shall we wait a bit longer?"
     fiver hesitated and then replied, "just as you think, hazel."
     "well, there's no need to do any serious digging, is there?" said bigwig. "that
sort of thing's all right for does, but not for us."
     "still, we'd better make one or two scrapes, don't you think?" said hazel.

he digging he kept away from fiver and sat
looking at the bank, as though entirely concerned with the work.
     a little while after ni-frith the sky clouded over thickly. the light grew dull and
they could smell rain approaching from the west. the blue tit that had been
swinging on a bramble, singing "heigh ho, go-and-get-another-bit-of-moss,"
stopped his acrobatics and flew into the wood. hazel was just wondering whether
it would be worthwhile starting a side passage to link bigwig's hole to
dandelion's, when he felt a stamp of warning from somewhere close by. he
turned quickly. it was fiver who had stamped and he was now staring intently
across the field.
     beside a tussock of grass a little way outside the opposite copse, a rabbit was
sitting and gazing at them. its ears were erect and it was evidently giving them the
full attention of sight, smell and hearing. hazel rose on his hind legs, paused, and
then sat back on his haunches, in full view. the other rabbit remained motionless.

the far end of the burrow began to
crumble inward, then it fell away and silver's head and front paws appeared.
     "here we are," said silver cheerfully. "we've done what you wanted, hazel, and
buckthorn's through next door. but what i'd like to know is, how about what's-
his-name? cowpat -- no -- cowslip? are we going to his warren or not? surely
we're not going to sit cowering in this place because we're frightened to go and
see him. whatever will he think of us?"
     "i'll tell you," said dandelion, from over his shoulder. "if he's not honest, he'll
know we're afraid to come; and if he is, he'll think we're suspicious, cowardly
skulkers. if we're going to live in these fields, we'll have to get on terms with his
lot sooner or later, and it goes against the grain to hang about and admit we
daren't visit them."
     "i don't know how many of them there are," said silver, "but we're quite a

     "no," said silver. "let's all go. if we're going at all, for frith's sake let's do it as
though we weren't afraid. what do you say, dandelion?"
     "i think you're right."
     "then we'll go now," said hazel. "get the others and follow me."

 conspicuous a warren as could well be imagined.
     "sky above us!" said bigwig. "every living creature for miles must know that's
there! look at all the tracks in the grass, too! do you think they sing in the
morning, like the thrushes?"
     "perhaps they're too secure to bother about concealing themselves," said
blackberry. "after all, the home warren was fairly plain to be seen."
     "yes, but not like that! a couple of hrududil could go down some of those
holes."
     "so could i," said dandelion. "i'm getting dreadfully wet."

     as they approached, a big rabbit appeared over the edge of the ditch, looked at
them quickly and vanished into the bank. a few moments later two others came
out and waited for them. they, too, were sleek and unusually large.
     "a rabbit called cowslip offered us shelter here," said hazel. "perhaps you
know that he came to see us?"
     both rabbits together made a curious, dancing movement of the head and front
paws. apart from sniffing, as hazel and cow

     "what's that got to do with fiver?" asked hazel sharply.
     "in fact," said cowslip, breaking into a run, "i'll go myself."
     but he did not engage the jackdaws and hazel saw him pick up another carrot
and start back with it. annoyed, he joined buckthorn and dandelion and the
three of them returned together. as they came up to the warren bank he suddenly
caught sight of fiver. he was sitting half concealed under the low spread of a yew
tree on the edge of the copse, some way from the holes of the warren. putting
down his carrot, hazel ran across, scrambled up the bank and joined him on the

bare ground under the low, close boughs. fiver said nothing and continued to
stare over the field.
     "aren't you coming to learn to carry, fiver?" asked hazel at leng

 "surely there's no harm in that?"
     "wait," replied hazel quietly. "let them tell us if they don't like it. they have
their own ways here."
     however, the silence continued for some time, as though the other rabbits did
not care to mention what they thought was wrong.
     "it's no good," said blackberry at last. "you'll have to say something yourself,
hazel. no, why should you? i'll do it." he spoke up again. "on second thoughts,
hazel remembers that we have a good storyteller among us. dandelion will tell
you a story of el-ahrairah. that can't go wrong, anyway," he whispered.
     "which one, though?" said dandelion.
     hazel remembered the stones by the well pit. "the king's lettuce," he
answered. "they think a lot of that, i believe."
     dandelion took up his cue with the same plucky readiness that he had shown

     hazel turned his head and looked down the course of the brook. far away,
between the two copses, he could see the cherry tree where two days before he
had sat with blackberry and fiver in the sunrise. he remembered how bigwig had
chased hawkbit through the long grass, forgetting the quarrel of the previous
night in the joy of their arrival. he could see hawkbit running toward him now
and two or three of the others -- silver, dandelion and pipkin. dandelion, well in
front, dashed up to the gap and checked, twitching and staring.
     "what is it, hazel? what's happened? fiver said--"
     "bigwig's in a wire. let him alone till blackberry tells us. stop the others
crowding round."
     dandelion turned and raced back as pipkin came up.
     "is cowslip coming?" said hazel. "perhaps he knows--"
     "he wouldn't come," replied pipkin. "he told fiver to stop talking about it."
     "told him what?" asked hazel incredulously. bu

a witch hare and those nearest to him fell back

was speaking.
     "the warren? you're going to the warren? you fools! that warren's nothing but
a death hole! the whole place is one foul elil's larder! it's snared -- everywhere,

here."
     he sat still and his words seemed to come crawling up the sunlight, over the
grass.
     "listen, dandelion. you're fond of stories, aren't you? i'll tell you one -- yes,
one for el-ahrairah to cry at. once there was a fine warren on the edge of a wood,
overlooking the meadows of a farm. it was big, full of rabbits. then one day the
white blindness came and the rabbits fell sick and died. but a few survived, as
they always do. the warren became almost empty. one day the farmer thought, 'i

who was coming was running in a curious, headlong manner. once he ran
straight into a thick-stemmed thistle, knocking himself sideways and rolling over
and over. but he got up and came blundering on toward them.
     "is it the white blindness?" said buckthorn. "he's not looking where he's
going."
     "frith forbid!" said blackberry. "shall we run away?"
     "no, he couldn't run like that with the white blindness," said hazel. "whatever
ails him, it isn't that."
     "it's strawberry!" cried dandelion.
     strawberry came through the hedge by the crab-apple tree, looked about him
and made his way to hazel. all his urbane self-possession had vanished. he was
staring and trembling and his great size seemed only to add to his air of stricken
misery. he cringed before them in the grass as hazel waited, stern and
motionless, with silver at his side.
     "hazel," said strawberry, "are you going away?"
     hazel made no answer, but silver said sharply, "what's that to you?"
     "take me with yo

 would not have stopped running after such punishment? there
was no more questioning of bigwig's strength, fiver's insight, blackberry's wits or
hazel's authority. when the rats came, buckthorn and silver had obeyed bigwig
and stood their ground. the rest had followed hazel when he roused them and,
without explanation, told them to go quickly outside the barn. later, hazel had
said that there was nothing for it but to cross the open pasture and under silver's
direction they had crossed it, with dandelion running ahead to reconnoiter.
when fiver said the iron tree was harmless they believed him.
     strawberry had had a bad time. his misery made him slow-witted and careless
and he was ashamed of the part he had played at the warren. he was soft and
more used than he dared admit to indolence and good food. but he made no
complaint and it was plain that he was determined to show what he could do and
not to be left behind. he had proved useful in the woodland, being better

     "before everyone goes up to the top," said hazel, "we ought to find out what it's
like. i'm going up myself to have a look round. i'll be as quick as i can and you'll
have to hope for the best until i get back. you can rest and feed, anyway."
     "you're not going alone," said fiver firmly.
     since each one of them was ready to go with him in spite of their fatigue, hazel
gave in and chose dandelion and hawkbit, who seemed less weary than the
others. they set out up the hillside, going slowly, picking their way from one bush
and tussock to another and pausing continually to sniff and stare along the great
expanse of grass, which stretched on either side as far as they could see.

l fear. if it grows intense enough they can become
glazed and paralyzed by it -- "tharn," to use their own word. hazel and his
companions had been on the jump for nearly two days. indeed, ever since they
had left their home warren, five days before, they had faced one danger after
another. they were all on edge, sometimes starting at nothing and, again, lying
down in any patch of long grass that offered. bigwig and buckthorn smelled of
blood and everyone else knew they did. what bothered hazel, dandelion and
hawkbit was the openness and strangeness of the down and their inability to see
very far ahead. they climbed not over but through the sun-red grass, among the
awakened insect movement and the light ablaze. the grass undulated about
them. they peered over anthills and looked cautiously round clumps of teazle.

d, he found himself gazing at the ridge, as over the skyline came the silent,
moving, red-tinged cumuli. their movement was disturbing, unlike that of trees
or grass or rabbits. these great masses moved steadily, noiselessly and always in
the same direction. they were not of his world.
     "o frith," thought hazel, turning his head for a moment to the bright glow in
the west, "are you sending us to live among the clouds? if you spoke truly to
fiver, help me to trust him." at this moment he saw dandelion, who had run well
ahead, squatting on an anthill clear against the sky. alarmed, he dashed forward.
     "dandelion, get down!" he said. "why are you sitting up there?"
     "because i can see," replied dandelion, with a kind of excited joy. "come and
look! you can see the whole world."
     hazel came up to him. there was another anthill nearby and he copied
dandelion, sitting upright on his hind legs and looking about him. he realized
now that they were almost on level ground. indeed, the slo

they would have seen it immediately: and where the turf ended, the sky began. a
man, a fox -- even a rabbit -- coming over the down would be conspicuous. fiver
had been right. up here, they would have clear warning of any approach.
     the wind ruffled their fur and tugged at the grass, which smelled of thyme and
self-heal. the solitude seemed like a release and a blessing. the height, the sky
and the distance went to their heads and they skipped in the sunset. "o frith on
the hills!" cried dandelion. "he must have made it for us!"
     "he may have made it, but fiver thought of it for us," answered hazel. "wait
till we get him up here! fiver-rah!"
     "where's hawkbit?" said dandelion suddenly.
     although the light was still clear, hawkbit was not to be seen anywhere on the
upland. after staring about for some time, they ran across to a little mound some
way away and looked again. but they saw nothing except a field mouse, which
came out of its hole and began furricking in a path of se

eded grasses.
     "he must have gone down," said dandelion.
     "well, whether he has or not," said hazel, "we can't go on looking for him. the
others are waiting and they may be in danger. we must go down ourselves."
     "what a shame to lose him, though," said dandelion, "just when we'd reached
fiver's hills without losing anyone. he's such a duffer; we shouldn't have brought
him up. but how could anything have got hold of him here, without our seeing?"

     "no, he's gone back, for sure," said hazel. "i wonder what bigwig will say to
him? i hope he won't bite him again. we'd better get on."
     "are you going to bring them up tonight?" asked dandelion.
     "i don't know," said hazel. "it's a problem. where's the shelter to be found?"

on the ground, between the thick, gnarled roots. they could see no footmarks and
no droppings. the holes were clearly deserted.
     "have you been down?" asked hazel, sniffing round.
     "yes, i have," said hawkbit. "three of them, anyway. they're shallow and
rather rough, but there's no smell of death or disease and they're perfectly sound.
i thought they might do for us -- just for the moment, anyway."
     in the twilight a swift flew screaming overhead and hazel turned to dandelion.
     "news! news!" he said. "go and get them up here."
     thus it fell to one of the rank and file to make a lucky find that brought them at
last to the downs: and probably saved a life or two, for they could hardly have
spent the night in the open, either on or under the hill, without being attacked by
some enemy or other.

out northward toward the bright, still fields and the dim pylon line stalking away
into the distance north of kingsclere. the air was cooler and the sun was
beginning once more to reach the north escarpment.

     "i think we've done enough," he said, "for today, anyway. i should like to go
down to the bottom of the hill and find some really good grass. this stuff's all
right in its way but it's rather thin and dry. does anyone feel like coming with
me?"
     bigwig, dandelion and speedwell were ready, but the others preferred to graze
their way back to the thorn trees and go underground with the sun. bigwig and
hazel picked the line that offered most cover and, with the others following, set
out on the four or five hundred yards to the foot of the hill. they met no trouble
and were soon feeding in the grass at the edge of the wheatfield, the very picture
of rabbits in an evening landscape. hazel, tired though he was, did not forget to

     "owls'll be out," said bigwig. "let's go up again."
     at this moment, from out in the darkening field, there came the sound of a
stamp on the ground. it was followed by another, closer to them, and they caught
a glimpse of a white tail. they both immediately ran to the ditch. now that they
had to use it in earnest, they found it even narrower than they had thought. there
was just room to turn round at the far end and as they did so speedwell and
dandelion tumbled in behind them.
     "what is it?" asked hazel. "what did you hear?"
     "there's something coming up the line of the hedge," replied speedwell. "an

animal. making a lot of noise, too."
     "did you see it?"
     "no, and i couldn't smell it either. it's downwind. but i heard it plainly
enough."
     "i heard it, too," said dandelion. "something fairly big -- as big as a rabbit,
anyway -- moving clumsily but trying to keep concealed, or so it seemed to me."

overgrown that they could not see out of it, but the place where they had come in
showed as a patch of sky -- an arc of very dark blue. as the time passed, a star
crept out from among the overhanging grasses. it seemed to pulsate in a rhythm
as faint and uneven as that of the wind. at length hazel turned his eyes away
from watching it.
     "well, we can snatch some sleep here," he said. "the night's not cold. whatever
it was you heard, we'd better not risk going out."
     "listen," said dandelion. "what's that?"
     for a moment hazel could hear nothing. then he caught a distant but clear
sound -- a kind of wailing or crying, wavering and intermittent. although it did
not sound like any sort of hunting call, it was so unnatural that it filled him with
fear. as he listened, it ceased.
     "what in frith's name makes a noise like that?" said bigwig, his great fur cap
hackling between his ears.
     "a cat?" said speedwell, wide-eyed.
     "that's no cat!" said bigwig, his lips drawn bac

grimace, "that's no cat! don't you know what it is? your mother--" he broke off.
then he said, very low, "your mother told you, didn't she?"
     "no!" cried dandelion. "no! it's some bird -- some rat -- wounded--"
     bigwig stood up. his back was arched and his head nodded on his stiffened
neck.
     "the black rabbit of inlé," he whispered, "what else -- in a place like this?"
     "don't talk like that!" said hazel. he could feel himself trembling, and braced
his legs against the sides of the narrow cut.
     suddenly the noise sounded again, nearer: and now there could be no mistake.
what they heard was the voice of a rabbit, but changed out of all rec

might have come from the cold spaces of the dark sky outside, so unearthly and
desolate was the sound. at first there was only a wailing. then, distinct and
beyond mistaking, they heard -- they all heard -- words.
     "zorn! zorn!"* cried the dreadful, squealing voice. "all dead! o zorn!"
     dandelion whimpered. bigwig was scuffling into the ground.
     "be quiet!" said hazel. "and stop kicking that earth over me! i want to listen,"
     at that moment, quite distinctly, the voice cried, "thlayli! o thlayli!"
     at this, all four rabbits felt the trance of utter panic. they grew rigid. then

 up and looked about him. there was no creature nearby.
     "who's there?" he said.
     there was silence, and he was about to speak again when the voice replied,
"zorn! o zorn!"
     it came from the hedge along the side of the field. hazel turned toward the
sound and in a few moments made out, under a clump of hemlock, the hunched
shape of a rabbit. he approached it and said, "who are you?" but there was no
reply. as he hesitated, he heard a movement behind him.
     "i'm here, hazel," said dandelion, in a kind of choking gasp.
     together they went closer. the figure did not move as they came up. in the
faint starlight they both saw a rabbit as real as themselves: a rabbit in the last
stages of exhaustion, its back legs trailing behind its flattened rump as though
paralyzed: a rabbit that stared, white-eyed, from one side to the other, seeing
nothing, yet finding no respite from its fear, and then fell to licking wretchedly at
one ripped and bloody ear that drooped across its face: a rab

duty was done and did it
himself. sound, unassuming, conscientious, a bit lacking in the rabbit sense of
mischief, he was something of the born second-in-command. there could have
been no question of trying to persuade him to leave the warren with hazel and
fiver. to find him under watership down at all, therefore, was astonishing
enough. but to find him in such a condition was all but incredible.
     in the first moments after they had recognized the poor creature under the
hemlock, hazel and dandelion felt completely stupefied, as though they had
come upon a squirrel underground or a stream that flowed uphill. they could not
trust their senses. the voice in the dark had proved not to be supernatural, but
the reality was frightening enough. how could captain holly be here, at the foot
of the down? and what could have reduced him -- of all rabbits -- to this state?
     hazel pulled himself together. whatever the explanation might be, the
immediate need was to take first things first. they wer

was crying uncontrollably and looked as though he could not move. there might
very well be a stoat on his trail at this moment. if they were going to help him
they had better be quick.

send speedwell up the hill to the others and tell him to make it clear that no one
is to come down. they couldn't help and it would only add to the risk."
     dandelion had no sooner gone than hazel became aware that something else
was moving in the hedge. but he had no time to wonder what it might be, for
almost immediately another rabbit appeared and limped to where holly was
lying.
     "you must help us if you can," he said to hazel. "we've had a very bad time and

nd here?"
     hazel recognized him as one of the rabbits who had come to arrest bigwig, but
he did not know his name.
     "why did you stay in the hedge and leave him to crawl about in the open?" he
asked.
     "i ran away when i heard you coming," replied the other rabbit. "i couldn't get
the captain to move. i thought you were elil and there was no point in staying to
be killed. i don't think i could fight a field mouse."
     "do you know me?" said hazel. but before the other could answer, dandelion
and bigwig came out of the darkness. bigwig stared at holly for a moment and
then crouched before him and touched noses.

     "holly, this is thlayli," he said. "you were calling me."
     holly did not answer, but only stared fixedly back at him. bigwig looked up.
"who's that who came with him?" he said. "oh, it's you, bluebell. how many
more of you?"
     "no more," said bluebell. he was about to go on when holly spoke.
     "thlayli," he said. "so we have found you."
     he sat up with di

fficulty and looked around at them.
     "you're hazel, aren't you?" he asked. "and that's -- oh, i should know, but i'm
in very poor shape, i'm afraid."
     "it's dandelion," said hazel. "listen -- i can see that you're exhausted, but we
can't stay here. we're in danger. can you come with us to our holes?"
     "captain," said bluebell, "do you know what the first blade of grass said to the
second blade of grass?"
     hazel looked at him sharply, but holly replied, "well?"
     "it said, 'look, there's a rabbit! we're in danger!'"
     "this is no time--" began hazel.
     "don't silence him," said holly. "we wouldn't be here at all without his blue

. yes, i can go now. is it far?"
     "not too far," said hazel, thinking it all too likely that holly would never get
there.
     it took a long time to climb the hill. hazel made them separate, himself
remaining with holly and bluebell while bigwig and dandelion went out to either
side. holly was forced to stop several times and hazel, full of fear, had hard work
to suppress his impatience. only when the moon began to rise -- the edge of its
great disc growing brighter and brighter on the skyline below and behind them --
did he at last beg holly to hurry. as he spoke he saw, in the white light, pipkin
coming down to meet them.
     "what are you doing?" he said sternly. "i told speedwell no one was to come
down."
     "it isn't speedwell's fault," said

 pipkin. "you stood by me at the river, so i
thought i'd come and look for you, hazel. anyway, the holes are just here. is it
really captain holly you've found?"
     bigwig and dandelion approached.
     "i'll tell you what," said bigwig. "these two will need to rest for a good long
time. suppose pipkin here and dandelion take them to an empty burrow and stay
with them as long as they want? the rest of us had better keep away until they
feel better."
     "yes, that's best," said hazel. "i'll go up with you now."
     they ran the short distance to the thorn trees. all the other rabbits were above
ground, waiting and whispering together.
     "shut up," said bigwig, before anyone had asked a question. "yes, it is holly,
and bluebell is with him -- no one else. they're in a bad way and they're not to be
troubled.

d silver followed them.
     "i say, what's happened, hazel?" asked silver. "it must be something very bad.
holly would never leave the threarah."
     "i don't know," replied hazel, "and neither does anyone else yet. we'll have to
wait until tomorow. holly may stop running, but i don't think bluebell will. now
let me alone to do this leg of buckthorn's."
     the wound was a great deal better and soon hazel fell asleep.
     the next day was as hot and cloudless as the last. neither pipkin nor
dandelion was at morning silflay; and hazel relentlessly took the others up to the
beech hanger to go on with the digging. he questioned strawberry about the great
burrow and learned that its ceiling, as well as being vaulted with a tangle of
fibers, was strengthened by roots going vertically down into the floor. he
remarked that he had not noticed these.
     "there aren't many, but they're important," said strawberry. "they take a lot of
the load. if it weren't for those roots the ceiling would fall af

     "hazel," said bigwig, "i know you're not stupid, but what did we get out of
that? are you going in for protecting every mole and shrew that can't get
underground?"
     the mouse had not moved. it was still crouching a little inside the run, on a
level with their heads and outlined against the light. hazel could see it watching
him.
     "perhaps hawk not gone," he said. "you stay now. go later."
     bigwig was about to speak again when dandelion appeared in the mouth of the
hole. he looked at the mouse, pushed it gently aside and came down the run.
     "hazel," he said, "i thought i ought to come and tell you about holly. he's
much better this evening, but he had a very bad night and so did we. every time
he seemed to be going to sleep, he kept starting up and crying. i thought he was
going out of his mind. pipkin kept talking to him -- he was first-rate -- and he
seems to set a lot of store by bluebell. bluebell kept on making jokes.

he honeycomb was still rough-dug and half finished, but it
would probably be as comfortable as the holes under the thorn trees. besides, if it
proved otherwise, they would have all the more inducement to improve it. to
know that they were actually making use of their day's hard work would please
everybody and they were likely to prefer this to a third night in the chalk holes.
     "i should think here," he said. "but we'll see how the others feel."
     "what's this mouse doing in here?" asked dandelion.
     hazel explained. dandelion was as puzzled as bigwig had been.
     "well, i'll admit i hadn't any particular idea when i went out to help it," said
hazel. "i have now, though, and i'll explain later what it is. but, first of all, bigwig
and i ought to go and talk to holly. and, dandelion, you go and tell the rest what
you told me, will you, and see what they want to do tonight?"
     they found holly with bluebell and pipkin, on the turf by the anthill where
dandelion had first looked ove

     even before holly had finished his story, hazel had fallen to sniffing at his

wounded ear. he had not previously been able to get a good look at it, but now
that he did, he realized that terror and fatigue had probably not been the
principal causes of holly's collapse. he was badly wounded -- worse than
buckthorn. he must have lost a lot of blood. his ear was in ribbons and there was
any amount of dirt in it. hazel felt annoyed with dandelion. as several of the
rabbits began to silflay, attracted by the mild june night and the full moon, he
asked blackberry to wait. silver, who had been about to leave by the other run,
returned and joined them.
     "dandelion and the other two seem to have cheered you up, all right," said
hazel to holly. "it's a pity they didn't clean you up as well. that dirt's dangerous."
     "well, you see--" began bluebell, who had remained beside holly.
     "don't make a joke," said hazel. "you seem to think

"but, holly, you smell of blood, you know. it may be dangerous, even here. let's
go back to the wood. it's such a beautiful night that we can sit near the holes to
chew pellets and bluebell can tell us his story."
     they found strawberry and buckthorn on the bank; and when everyone was
comfortably chewing, with ears laid flat, bluebell began.

     "dandelion was telling me last night about cowslip's warren and how he told
the story of the king's lettuce. that's what put me in mind of this tale, even
before hazel explained his idea. i used to hear it from my grandfather and he
always said that it happened after el-ahrairah had got his people out of the
marshes of kelfazin. they went to the meadows of fenlo and there they dug their
holes. but prince rainbow had his eye on el-ahrairah; and he was determined to
see that he didn't get up to any more of

then it opened its wings high above its body and hazel jumped back, startled by
the great, arching span. but at once it closed them again, grimacing with pain.
     "ving no good. i come."
     it followed hazel docilely enough across the grass, but he was careful to keep
out of its reach. their arrival outside the wood caused something of a sensation,
which hazel cut short with a peremptory sharpness quite unlike his usual
manner.
     "come on, get busy," he said to dandelion and buckthorn. "this bird's hurt
and we're going to shelter it until it's better. ask bigwig to show you how to get it
some food. it eats worms and insects. try grasshoppers, spiders -- anything.
hawkbit! acorn! yes, and you too, fiver -- come out of that rapt trance, or
whatever you're in. we need an open, wide hole, broader than it's deep, with a flat
floor a little below the level of the entrance: by nightfall."

 speaking came when he was sitting on the bank at
sunrise, with fiver and three or four others. there was no need to summon a
general gathering. the thing was settled. when it reached them, those who were
not there would accept what he had said without having heard him at all.
     "this warren that kehaar found," said hazel, "he said it was big."
     "so we can't take it by force," said bigwig.
     "i don't think i want to go and join it," said hazel. "do you?"
     "and leave here?" replied dandelion. "after all our work? besides, i reckon
we'd have a thin time. no, i'm sure none of us wants to do that."
     "what we want is to get some does and bring them back here," said hazel.

"will that be difficult, do you think?"
     "i should have thought not," said holly. "big warrens are often overcrowded
and some of the rabbits can't get enough to eat. the young does get edgy and
nervous and some of them don't have any kittens on that account. at least, the
kittens begin to grow inside them an

four can travel quickly and aren't conspicuous:
and the chief rabbit of this warren would be less likely to object to a few
strangers coming with a civil request."
     "i'm sure that's right," said hazel. "we'll send four rabbits: and they can
explain how we come to be in this difficulty and ask to be allowed to persuade
some does to come back with them. i don't see that any chief rabbit can object to
that. i wonder which of us would be the best to send?"
     "hazel-rah, you mustn't go," said dandelion. "you're needed here and we don't
want to risk you. everyone's agreed on that."
     hazel had known already that they would not let him lead the embassy. it was
a disappointment, but nevertheless he felt that they were right the other warren
would have little opinion of a chief rabbit who ran his own errands. besides, he
was not particularly impressive in appearance or as a speaker. this was a job for
someone else.
     "all right," he said. "i knew you wouldn't let me go. i'm not the right fe

finished the last of the burnet and answered himself in the starlight. "i'll just have
a look round," he said, "and if i can find those box rabbits i'll try to talk to them;
nothing more than that. i'm not going to take any risks -- well, not real risks --
not until i see whether it's worth it, anyway."
     should he go alone? it would be safer and more pleasant to take a companion;
but not more than one. they must not attract attention. who would be best?
bigwig? dandelion? hazel rejected them. he needed someone who would do as
he was told and not start having ideas of his own. at once he thought of pipkin.
pipkin would follow him without question and do anything he asked. at this
moment he was probably asleep in the burrow which he shared with bluebell and
acorn, down a short run leading off the honeycomb.
     hazel was lucky. he found pipkin close to the mouth of the burrow and already
awake. he brought him out without disturbing the other two rabbits and led

not see a chain; but then, after a moment, he noticed the
line of a thin rope that came out through the kennel door and ended in some sort
of fastening on the roof. "why a rope?" he wondered and then thought, "because
a restless dog cannot rattle it in the night."
     the two rabbits began to wander among the outbuildings. at first they took
care to remain in cover and continually on the watch for cats. but they saw none
and soon grew bolder, crossing open spaces and even stopping to nibble at
dandelions in the patches of weeds and rough grass. guided by scent, hazel made
his way to a low-roofed shed. the door was half open and he went through it with
scarcely a pause at the brick threshold. immediately opposite the door, on a
broad wooden shelf -- a kind of platform -- stood a wire-fronted hutch. through
the mesh he could see a brown bowl, some greenstuff and the ears of two or three
rabbits. as he stared, one of the rabbits came close to the wire, looked out and
saw him.

, but he, like bigwig and hazel himself,
was secretly disappointed not to have gone on the expedition with holly; and
when the other two pointed out that they were relying on him to tell them how to
get the hutch open, he agreed to come.
     "do we need to take everyone?" he asked. "you say the dog's tied up and i
suppose there can't be more than three cats. too many rabbits will only be a
nuisance in the dark: someone will get lost and we shall have to spend time
looking for him."
     "well, dandelion, speedwell and hawkbit, then," said bigwig, "and leave the
others behind. do you mean to go tonight, hazel-rah?"
     "yes, the sooner the better," said hazel. "get hold of those three and tell them.

     however, their hopes for that night were disappointed, for the rain returned
before dusk, settling in on a northwest wind and carrying up the hill the sweet-
sour smell of flowering privet from cottage hedges belo

until the light had quite faded. at last, when it was clear that the rain was going to
stay for the night, he joined the others in the honeycomb. they had persuaded
kehaar to come down out of the wind and wet, and one of dandelion's tales of el-
ahrairah was followed by an extraordinary story that left everyone mystified but
fascinated, about a time when frith had to go away on a journey, leaving the
whole world to be covered with rain. but a man built a great floating hutch that
held all the animals and birds until frith returned and let them out.
     "it won't happen tonight, will it, hazel-rah?" asked pipkin, listening to the rain
in the beech leaves outside. "there's no hutch here."

higher and smaller, settling at last into a mackerel sky like a beach at low tide.
hazel took bigwig and blackberry to the edge of the escarpment, whence they
could look across to nuthanger on its little hill. he described the approach and
went on to explain how the rabbit hutch was to be found. bigwig was in high
spirits. the wind and the prospect of action excited him and he spent some time
with dandelion, hawkbit and speedwell, pretending to be a cat and encouraging
them to attack him as realistically as they could. hazel, whose talk with fiver had
somewhat clouded him, recovered as he watched them tussling over the grass and
ended by joining in himself, first as an attacker and then as the cat, staring and
quivering for all the world like the nuthanger tabby.
     "i shall be disappointed if we don't meet a cat after all this," said dandelion, as
he waited for his turn to run at a fallen beech

ched the far end of the barn was not hazel's tabby, but another; ginger, black
and white (and therefore a female); one of those slim, trotting, quick-moving,
tail-twitching cats that sit on farm windowsills in the rain or keep watch from the
tops of sacks on sunny afternoons. it came briskly round the corner of the barn,
saw the rabbits and stopped dead.
     without an instant's hesitation bigwig went straight for it, as though it had
been the beech branch on the down. but quicker even than he dandelion ran
forward, scratched it and leaped clear. as it turned, bigwig threw his full weight
upon it from the other side. the cat closed with him, biting and scratching, and
bigwig rolled over on the ground. the others could hear him swearing like a cat
himself and struggling for a hold. then he sank one back leg into the cat's side
and kicked backward rapidly, several times.

assailant. a dog that tries to make itself

     it was hawkbit who found the little yard. hazel had been anxious in case the
shed door might be shut; but it stood just ajar and the five of them slipped in one
after the other. in the thick gloom they could not make out the hutch, but they
could both smell and hear the rabbits.
     "blackberry," said bigwig quickly, "you come with me and get the hutch open.
you other three, keep watching. if another cat comes, you'll have to take it on
yourselves."
     "fine," said dandelion. "just leave it to us."
     bigwig and blackberry found the straw bale and climbed on the planks. as they
did so, boxwood spoke from the hutch.
     "who's that? hazel-rah, have you come back?"
     "hazel-rah has sent us," answered blackberry. "we've come to let you out. will
you come with us?"
     there was a pause and some movement in the hay and then clover replied,
"yes, let us out."
     blackberry sniffed his way round to the wire door and sat up, nosing over the
frame, the hasp and th

he hutch itself. as boxwood dropped back on all
fours, blackberry saw that the hinge had buckled and risen just clear of the wood.
     "try it now," he said to bigwig.
     bigwig got his teeth to the hinge and pulled. it tore a very little.
     "by frith, that'll do," said blackberry, for all the world like the duke of
wellington at salamanca. "we just need time, that's all."
     the hinge had been well made and did not give way until they had put it to a
great deal more tugging and biting. dandelion grew nervous and twice gave a
false alarm. bigwig, realizing that the sentries were on the jump from watching
and waiting with nothing to do, changed places with him and sent speedwell up
to take over from blackberry. when at last dandelion and speedwell had pulled
the leather strip off the nail, bigwig came back to the hutch himself. but they did

farmhouse and made toward them. as it passed the kennel the labrador woke
and sat up, thrusting out its head and shoulders and looking first to one side and
then the other. it saw the rabbits, ran to the length of its rope and began to bark.
     "come on!" said bigwig. "we can't stay here. up the lane, everybody, and
quickly, too." blackberry, speedwell and hawkbit ran at once, taking boxwood

and clover with them into the darkness under the barn. dandelion remained
beside haystack, begging her to move and expecting every moment to feel the
cat's claws in his back. bigwig leaped across to him.
     "dandelion," he said in his ear, "get out of it, unless you want to be killed!"
     "but the--" began dandelion.
     "do as i say!" said bigwig. the noise of barking was fearful and he himself was
close to panic. dandelion hesitated a moment longer. then he left haystack and
shot up the lane, with bigwig beside him.

an angry dog?"
     "no, of course not," replied hazel. "you've done wonders, bigwig. they were
just telling me, before you came, that you gave one of the cats such a beating that
it was afraid to come back for more. now look, do you think you and blackberry,
with speedwell here and hawkbit, can get these two rabbits back to the warren?
i'm afraid you may need most of the night. they can't go very fast and you'll have
to be patient with them. dandelion, you come with me, will you?"
     "where, hazel-rah?"
     "to fetch the other two," said hazel. "you're the fastest, so it won't be so
dangerous for you, will it? now, don't hang about, bigwig, there's a good fellow.
i'll see you tomorrow."
     before bigwig could reply he had disappeared under the elms. dandelion
remained where he was, looking at bigwig uncertainly.
     "are you going to do what he says?" asked bigwig.
     "well, are you?" said dandelion.
     it took bigwig no more than

a moment to realize that if he said he was not,
complete disorganization would follow. he could not take all the others back into
the farm, and he could not leave them alone. he muttered something about hazel
being too embleer clever by half, cuffed hawkbit off a sow thistle he was nibbling
and led his five rabbits over the bank into the field. dandelion, left alone, set off
after hazel into the farmyard.
     as he went down the side of the barn, he could hear hazel out in the open, near
the doe haystack. neither of the hutch rabbits had moved from where he and
bigwig had left them. the dog had returned to its kennel; but although it was not
to be seen, he felt that it was awake and watchful. he came cautiously out of the

shadow and approached hazel.
     "i'm just having a chat with haystack here," said hazel. "i've been explaining

get him to join us?"
     he spoke almost gaily, but dandelion could see his dilated eyes and the slight
trembling of his front paws. he himself was now sensing something peculiar -- a
kind of luminosity -- in the air. there seemed to be a curious vibration
somewhere in the distance. he looked round for the cats and saw that, as he
feared, both were crouching in front of the farmhouse a little way off. their
reluctance to come closer could be attributed to bigwig: but they would not go
away. looking across the yard at them, dandelion felt a sudden clutch o

f horror.
     "hazel!" he whispered. "the cats! dear frith, why are their eyes glittering
green like that? look!"
     hazel sat up quickly and as he did so dandelion leaped back in real terror, for
hazel's eyes were shining a deep, glowing red in the dark. at that moment the
humming vibration grew louder, quenching the rushing of the night breeze in the
elms. then all four rabbits sat as though transfixed by the sudden, blinding light
that poured over them like a cloudburst. their very instinct was numbed in this
terrible glare. the dog barked and then became silent once more. dandelion tried
to move, but could not. the awful brightness seemed to cut into h

     the car, which had driven up the lane and over the brow under the elms, came
on a few more yards and stopped.
     "lucy's rabbits is out, look!"
     "ah! best get 'un in quick. leave loights on!"
     the sound of men's voices, from somewhere beyond the fierce light, brought
hazel to his senses. he could not see, but nothing, he realized, had happened to
his hearing or his nose. he shut his eyes and at once knew where he was.
     "dandelion! haystack! shut your eyes and run," he said. a moment later he
smelled the lichen and cool moisture of one of the staddle stones. he was under
the barn. dandelion was near him and a little further away was haystack.
outside, the men's boots scraped and grated over the stones.
     "that's it! get round be'ind 'un."
     "'e won't go far!"

said. "just follow me."

d floor of the barn, they all three scuttled back toward
the elm trees. the men's voices were left behind. coming out into the grass near
the lane, they found the darkness behind the headlights full of the fumes of
exhaust -- a hostile, choking smell that added to their confusion. haystack sat
down once more and could not be persuaded to move.
     "shouldn't we leave her, hazel-rah?" asked dandelion. "after all, the men
won't hurt her -- they've caught laurel and taken him back to the hutch."
     "if it was a buck, i'd say yes," said hazel. "but we need this doe. that's what we
came for."
     at this moment they caught the smell of burning white sticks and heard the
men returning up the farmyard. there was a metallic bumping as they rummaged

in the car. the sound seemed to rouse haystack. she looked round at dandelion.
     "i don't want to go back to the hutch," she said.
     "you're

     "yes. i'll go with you."
     dandelion immediately turned for the hedgerow. it was only when he had
crossed it and reached the ditch beyond that he realized that he was on the
opposite side of the lane from that on which they had first approached. he was in
a strange ditch. however, there seemed to be nothing to worry about -- the ditch
led down the slope and that was the way home. he moved slowly along it, waiting
for hazel to join them.
     hazel had crossed the lane a few moments after dandelion and haystack.

     "ah! reckon rest of ours ain't s' far off. got up there with 'un, see? best go'n

     in the ditch, hazel overtook haystack and dandelion under a clump of
brambles.
     "get on quickly if you can," he said to haystack. "the men are just behind."
     "we can't get on, hazel," said dandelion, "without leaving the ditch. it's
blocked."
     hazel sniffed ahead. immediately beyond the brambles, the ditch was closed
by a pile of earth, weeds and rubbish. they would have to come into the open.
already the men were over the bank and the torchlight was flickering up and
down the hedgerow and through the brambles above their very heads.

 then, only
a few yards away, footfalls vibrated along the edge of the ditch. hazel turned to
dandelion.
     "listen," he said, "i'm going to run across the corner of the field, from this
ditch to the other one, so that they see me. they'll try to shine that light on me for
sure. while they're doing that, you and haystack climb the bank, get into the lane
and run down to the swede shed. you can hide there and i'll join you. ready?"
     there was no time to argue. a moment later hazel broke almost under the
men's feet and ran across the field.
     "there 'e goes!"
     "keep torch on 'un, then.

     dandelion and haystack scrambled over the bank and dropped into the lane.
hazel, with the torch beam behind him, had almost reached the other ditch when
he felt a sharp blow on one of his hind legs and a hot, stinging pain along his side.
the report of the cartridge sounded an instant later. as he somersaulted into a
clump of nettles in the ditch bottom, he remembered vividly the scent of
beanflowers at sunset. he had not known that the men had a gun.
     hazel crawled through the nettles, dragging his

aid quickly. "where do you want to run to, anyway? no holes
here."
     "further away from the gun," replied blackberry, white-eyed.
     "wait!" said bigwig, listening. "they're running down the lane. can't you hear
them?"
     "i can hear only two rabbits," answered blackberry, after a pause, "and one of
them sounds exhausted."
     they looked at each other and waited. then bigwig got up again.
     "stay here, all of you," he said. "i'll go and bring them in."
     out on the verge he found dandelion urging haystack, who was lamed and
spent.
     "come in here quickly," said bigwig. "for frith's sake, where's hazel?"
     "the men have shot him," replied dandelion.
     they reached the other five rabbits in the straw. dandelion did not wait for
their questions.
     "they've shot hazel," he said. "they'd caught that laurel and put him back in
the hutch. then they came after us. the three of us were at the end of a blocked
ditch. hazel went out of his own accord, to distract their attention

     "are you sure they killed him?" said speedwell.
     "i didn't actually see him hit, but they were very close to him."
     "we'd better wait," said bigwig.
     they waited a long time. at last dandelion and bigwig went cautiously back up

the lane. they found the bottom of the ditch trampled by boots and streaked with
blood, and returned to tell the others.
     the journey back, with the three limping hutch rabbits, lasted more than two
weary hours. all were dejected and wretched. when at last they reached the foot
of the down bigwig told blackberry, speedwell and hawkbit to leave them and go
on to the warren. they approached the wood just at first light and a rabbit ran to
meet them through

 as though still seeking the bleeding
rabbit who had vanished in the half-light. then, as blackberry said nothing more,
he asked, "do you know what happened?"
     when blackberry had told his news, fiver returned to the warren and went
underground to his empty burrow. a little later bigwig brought the hutch rabbits
up the hill and at once called everyone to meet in the honeycomb. fiver did not
appear.
     it was a dismal welcome for the strangers. not even bluebell could find a
cheerful word. dandelion was inconsolable to think that he might have stopped
hazel breaking from the ditch. the meeting came to an end in a dreary silence
and a half-hearted silflay.
     later that morning holly came limping into the warren. of his three
companions, only silver was alert and unharmed. buckthorn was wounded in the
face and strawberry was shivering and evidently ill from exhaustion. there were
no other rabbits with them.

     "but surely it alters them very much, living like that?" asked dandelion.

ent as they waited for hazel. during the previous few days
blackberry had had to repeat several times the story of the journey to the farm
and the finding of hazel in the drain. one or two had suggested that kehaar must
have found hazel and told fiver secretly. but kehaar denied this and, when

pressed, replied cryptically that fiver was one who had traveled a good deal
further than he had himself. as for hazel, he had acquired, in everyone's eyes, a
kind of magical quality. of all the warren, dandelion was the last rabbit to fail to
do justice to a good story and he had made the most of hazel's heroic dash out of
the ditch to save his friends from the farmers. no one had even suggested that
hazel might have been reckless in going to the farm. against all odds he had got
them two does: and now he was bringing their luck back to the warren.

     there were murmurs of astonishment, and then speedwell asked, "how?"
     "blackberry and i have got a plan," said hazel, "but i'm not going to explain it
now, for this reason. you all know that this is going to be a dangerous business. if
any of you get caught and taken into efrafa, they'll make you talk, all right. but
those who don't know a plan can't give it away. i'll explain it later on, at the
proper time."
     "are you going to need many rabbits, hazel-rah?" asked dandelion. "from all i
hear, the whole lot of us wouldn't be enough to fight the efrafans."
     "i hope we shan't have to fight at all," replied hazel, "but there's always the
possibility. anyway, it'll be a long journey home with the does, and if by any
chance we meet a wide patrol on the way, there have got to be enough of us to
deal with them."
     "would we have to go into efrafa?" asked pipkin timidly.
     "no," said hazel, "we shall--"
     "i never thought, hazel," interrupted holly, "i never t

ht of his leadership, when they had been
forced to rest in the wood above the enborne. at least it was good to see that no
one was exhausted now: they were as tough a bunch of hlessil as ever raided a
garden. not a blade of grass to choose between them, thought hazel: pipkin and
fiver looked as fresh as silver and bigwig. still, a little entertainment would be all
to the good and raise their spirits. he was just going to speak up when acorn
saved him the trouble.
     "will you tell us a story, dandelion?" he asked.
     "yes! yes!" said several others. "come on! make it a stunner while you're at it!"
     "all right," said dandelion. "how about 'el-ahrairah and the fox in the
water'?"
     "let's have 'the hole in the sky,'" said hawkbit.
     "no, not that," said bigwig suddenly. he had spoken very little all the evening
and everyone looked round. "if you're going to tell a story, there's only one i
want," he went on. "'el-ahrairah and the black rabbit of inlé.'"
     "perhaps not that one,"

 said hazel.
     bigwig rounded on him, snarling. "if there's going to be a story, don't you think
i've got as good a right as anyone to choose it?" he asked.
     hazel did not reply and after a pause, during which no one else spoke,
dandelion, with a rather subdued manner, began.

31.     the story of el-ahrairah and the black rabbit of inlé

     the power of the night, the press of the storm,
     the post of the foe;

e only one." in fact he
himself seemed composed and even detached, which was more than could be said
for any other rabbit in the audience: but pipkin was hardly to realize this. "let's
go out there for a bit and watch the spiders catching moths, shall we?" said fiver.
"i think i can remember where i left a patch of vetch -- it must be somewhere this
way." still talking quietly, he led pipkin out into the overgrown combe. hazel
turned to make sure of the direction they had taken and as he did so dandelion
hesitated, uncertain whether to resume.
     "go on," said bigwig, "and don't leave anything out."

     "i think many things are left out, if only the truth could be known," said
dandelion, "for no one can say what happens in that country where el-ahrairah
went of his own accord and we do not. but, as i was told, when they first became
aware of the black rabbit, they fled down the tunnel -- as needs they must, for
there was nowhere else to run. and this they did although they had come on

 the edge. then, if he succeeds in getting
close to where the rabbits are at silflay along the bank or in the field, he lies still
and watches his chance for a quick snatch. it is said that sometimes he fascinates
them, as the weasel does, by rolling and playing in the open, coming closer little
by little until he can make a grab. however this may be, it is certain that no fox
hunts rabbits by going openly up a combe at sunset.
     neither hazel nor any of the rabbits who had been listening to dandelion's
story had ever seen a fox. nevertheless, they knew that a fox in the open, plain to
be seen, is not dangerous as long as it is spotted in time. hazel realized that he

had been careless to allow everyone to gather round dandelion and to have failed
to post even one sentry. what wind there was was from the northeast and the fox,
coming up the combe from the west, might have broken in upon them without
warning. but from this danger they had been saved by fiver and pipkin going into
the open. e

where hazel was
encouraging bluebell and pipkin.
     "you can pluck up your spirits, bluebell," he said. "i think we're close to the
iron road."

     "i wouldn't care about my spirits," said bluebell, "if my legs weren't so tired.
slugs are lucky not to have legs. i think i'll be a slug."
     "well, i'm a hedgehog," said hazel, "so you'd better get on!"
     "you're not," replied bluebell. "you haven't enough fleas. now, slugs don't
have fleas, either. how comforting to be a slug, among the dandelions so snug--"
     "and feel the blackbird's sudden tug," said hazel. "all right, silver, we're
coming. but where is the iron road? holly said a steep, overgrown bank. i can't
make out anything like that."
     "no, that's away up by efrafa. down here it runs in a sort of combe of its own.
can't you smell it?"
     hazel sniffed. in the cool damp, he picked up at once the unnatural smells of
metal, coal smoke and oil. they went forward and in a very short time found
themselves looking down from a

t's get across. what would you do if a hrududu came?"
     "run," said fiver simply, "like this." and he scurried off the further end of the
bridge into the grass beyond.
     on this far side of the river, undergrowth and a grove of great horse chestnuts
extended almost down to the bridge. the ground was marshy, but at least there
was plenty of cover. fiver and pipkin began at once on some scrapes, while hazel
sat chewing pellets and resting his injured leg. soon they were joined by silver
and dandelion, but the other rabbits, more hesitant even than hazel, remained
crouching in the long grass on the right bank. at last, just before darkness fell,
fiver re-crossed the bridge and coaxed them to follow him back. bigwig, to
everyone's surprise, showed considerable reluctance, and only crossed in the end
after kehaar, returning from another flight over efrafa, had asked whether he
would like him to go and fetch a fox.
     the night that followed seemed to all of them disorganized and precarious.

gwig! bigwig! what do you want us to do?" it was silver.
     "where's hazel?" he said.
     "waiting at the boat. i say, you're wounded! what--"
     "then get these does down there," said bigwig.
     all was confusion. in ones and twos the does, utterly bemused and scarcely
able to move or to understand what was said to them, were urged into getting up
and stumbling their way down the field. other rabbits began to appear through
the rain: acorn, clearly frightened, but determined not to run; dandelion
encouraging pipkin; speedwell and hawkbit making toward kehaar -- the only
creature visible above the ground haze. bigwig and silver brought them together
as best they could and made them understand that they were to help to get the
does away.
     "go back to blackberry, go back to blackberry," silver kept repeating. "i left
three of our rabbits in different places to mark the way back," he explained to
bigwig. "blackberry's first, then bluebell, then fiver -- he's quite near the river."
     
 
 ___________________________
 
't realized about the boat, too? it wouldn't
surprise me." he dashed across the grass and jumped on the planking beside
hazel.
     the appearance of woundwort had achieved what blackberry and fiver could
not. every one of the does ran from the bank to the boat. blackberry and fiver
ran with them. woundwort, following them close, reached the edge of the bank
and came face to face with bigwig. as he stood his ground, bigwig could hear
blackberry just behind him, speaking urgently to hazel.
     "dandelion's not here," said blackberry. "he's the only one."
     hazel spoke for the first time. "we shall have to leave him," he answered. "it's
a shame, but these fellows will be at us in a moment and we can't stop them."
     bigwig spoke without taking his eyes from woundwort. "just a few more
moments, hazel," he said. "i'll keep them off. we can't leave dandelion."
     woundwort sneered up at him. "i trusted you, thlayli," he said. "you can trust
me now. you'll either go into the river or be torn

to pieces here -- the whole lot of
you. there's nowhere left to run."
     bigwig had caught sight of dandelion looking out of the undergrowth opposite.
he was plainly at a loss.
     "groundsel! vervain!" said woundwort. "come over here beside me. when i
give the word, we'll go straight into them. as for that bird, it's not dangerous--"
     "there it is!" cried bigwig. woundwort looked up quickly and leaped back.
dandelion shot out of the bushes, crossed the path in a flash and was on the boat
beside hazel. in the same moment the rope parted and immediately the little
punt began to move along the bank in the steady current. when it had gone a few
yards, the stern swung slowly outward until it was broadside on to the stream. in
this position it drifted to the middle of the river and into the southward bend.
     looking back, the last thing bigwig saw was the face of general woundwort
staring out of the gap in the

 a member of the council police," said bigwig.
     "a what?" the term "owslafa" was unknown to hazel.
     "a dirty little beast like hufsa," said bigwig.
     "did you beat him?"
     "oh, yes -- or i shouldn't be here. i should think he'll stop running. i say,
hazel-rah, we've got the does. what's going to happen now?"
     "i don't know," said hazel. "we need one of these clever rabbits to tell us. and
kehaar -- where's he gone? he's supposed to know about this thing we're sitting
on."
     dandelion, crouching beside hazel, got up at the mention of "clever rabbits,"
made his way across the puddled floor and returned with blackberry and fiver.
     "we're all wondering what to do next," said hazel.
     "well," said blackberry, "i suppose we shall drift into the bank before long and
then we can get out and find cover. there's no harm, though, in going a good long
way from those friends of bigwig's."
     "there is," said hazel. "we're stuck here in full view and we can't run. if a man

e the bridge, between it and
a thorn bush upstream, was a ledge of turf which overhung the water. out in the
river, a few feet away, the punt lay against the weedy piers.
     "silver!" said hazel. "fiver! come on, get them into the water. it's all right
below the bridge. get the does in first, if you can. there's no time to lose. the
men may come back."
     it was no easy matter to rouse the torpid, bewildered does and make them
understand what they had to do. silver went from one to another. dandelion, as
soon as he saw hazel on the bank, went at once to the bow and plunged in.
speedwell followed, but as fiver was about to go silver stopped him.
     "if all our bucks go, hazel," he said, "the does will be left alone and i don't
think they'll manage it."
     "they'll obey thlayli, sir," said blackavar, before hazel could reply. "i think
he's the one to get them started."
     bigwig was still lying in the bilgewater, in the place he had taken up when they
came to the first bridge. he seemed

 as kehaar would say, and
that's the real reason why bluebell and the rest are prepared to be at the trouble
of digging scrapes. surely it'll be all right at that rate, won't it? you know what
they say -- 'rabbit underground, rabbit safe and sound.'"
     "well, you may be right," said fiver. "that vilthuril's a beautiful doe. i'd like a
chance to get to know her better. after all, it's not natural to rabbits, is it? -- on
and on day after day."
     later, however, when blackavar returned with dandelion from a patrol they
had undertaken on their own initiative, he came out more strongly against the
idea.
     "this is no place to stop, hazel-rah," he said. "no wide patrol would bivouac
here. it's fox country. we ought to try to get further before dark."
     bigwig's shoulder had been hurting him a good deal during the afternoon and
he felt low and surly. it seemed to him that blackavar was being clever at other

people's expense. if he got his way they would have to go on, tired as they were

neered bigwig. "did you see any hraka? pick up any
scent? or was it just a message from little green mice singing under a toadstool?"
     blackavar felt hurt. bigwig was the last rabbit he wanted to quarrel with.
     "ye think i'm a fool, then," he answered, his efrafan accent becoming more
marked. "no, there was neether hraka ner scent, but i still think that this is a
place where a fox comes. on these patrols we used to do, ye know, we--"
     "did you see or smell anything?" said bigwig to dandelion.
     "er -- well, i'm not really quite sure," said dandelion. "i mean, blackavar
seems to know an awful lot about patrolling and he asked me whether i didn't feel
a sort of--"
     "well, we can go on like this all night," said bigwig. "blackavar, do you know
that earlier this summer, before we had the benefit of your experience, we went
for days across every kind of country -- fields, heather, woods, downs -- and never
lost one rabbit?"
     "it's the idea of scrapes, that's all," said blacka

re not in
efrafa now. has he really forgotten that he warned us?"
     "probably he really has. but whether or not, you'd never get him to admit that
he warned you or to listen while you told him he'd been right. he could no more
do that than pass hraka underground."
     "but you're an efrafan. do you think like that, too?"

     "i'm a doe," said hyzenthlay.

          -<*>-

     during the early afternoon they began to approach the belt and bigwig was the
first to recognize the place where dandelion had told the story of the black rabbit
of inlé.
     "it was the same fox, you know," he said to hazel. "that's almost certain. i
ought to have realized how likely it was that--"
     "look here," said hazel, "you know very well what we owe to you. the does all
think el-ahrairah sent you to get them out of efrafa. they believe no one else
could have done it. as for what happened this morning, it was my fault as much
as yours. but i never supposed we would get home without losing some rabbits.

 hanging about in the rear. at last, in the late afternoon, hazel
sent for him and told him to go ahead, on the line of the path they were following,
and look out for the long strip of the beech hanger in the dip on the morning side.
blackavar had not been gone very long before he came racing back.
     "hazel-rah, i've been quite close to that wood you spoke of," he said, "and
there are two rabbits playing about on a patch of short grass just outside it."
     "i'll come and see," said hazel. "dandelion, you come, too, will you?"
     as they ran down the hill to the right of the track, hazel fairly skipped to
recognize the beech hanger. he noticed one or two yellow leaves and a faint touch
of bronze here and there in the green boughs. then he caught sight of buckthorn

and strawberry running toward them across the grass.
     "hazel-rah!" cried buckthorn. "dandelion! what happened? where are the
others? did you get any does? is everyone all right?"
     "they'll be here very soon," said haze

. i think we ought to be able to get below
the frost. as for the wind, we can block some of the holes and sleep warm. grass
is poor in winter, i know; but anyone who wants a change can always go out with
holly here and try his luck at pinching some greenstuff or cattle roots. it's a time
of year to be careful of the elil, though. myself, i shall be quite happy to sleep
underground, play bob-stones and hear a few stories from time to time."
     "what about a story now?" said bluebell. "come on, dandelion. 'how i nearly
missed the boat.' what about that?"
     "oh, you mean 'woundwort dismayed,'" said dandelion. "that's bigwig's story
-- i wouldn't presume to tell it. but it makes a change to be thinking about winter
on an evening like this. it reminds me of a story i've listened to but never tried to
tell myself. so some of you may know it and perhaps some won't. it's the story of
rowsby woof and the fairy wogdog."
     "off you go," said fiver, "and lay it on thick."

el-ahrairah; and he had the frost in his fine new whiskers. the earth up and down
the runs of the warren was so hard that you could cut your paws on it, and the
robins answered each other across the bare, still copses, 'this is my bit here. you
go and starve in your own.'

     "well, never mind," said hazel. "go on with the story."
     "in the end," continued dandelion, "rabscuttle kept well away from him, but
el-ahrairah held his breath and still carried the nose somehow, until they got to
the place where they had buried the meat.

     "they dug it up and the paper came off. the meat was all bits joined together

gravel. 'ah, what elegance! what aristocratic distinction! can that really be
decayed cat that i smell? with a delicate overtone of rotten camel! ah, the

     ("what on earth's 'camel'?" said bigwig.
     "i don't know," replied dandelion. "but it was in the story when i heard it, so i
suppose it's some creature or other.")
     "'happy, happy dog!' said el-ahrairah. 'i must tell you that queen dripslobber

of how he had saved both his master and the good fairy wogdog from the wicked
rat spirit."

     as he came to the end of his story, dandelion remembered that he was
supposed to be relieving acorn as sentry. the post was a little way away, near the
eastern corner of the wood, and hazel -- who wanted to see how boxwood and
speedwell were getting on with a hole they were digging -- went with dandelion
along the foot of the bank. he was just going down the new hole when he noticed
that some small creature was pattering about in the grass. it was the mouse that
he had saved from the kestrel. pleased to see that he was still safe and sound

     shortly after ni-frith, woundwort went back to pick up stragglers. he found
three, one injured by a piece of glass. he stopped the bleeding, brought the three
up to rejoin their groups and then called a halt to rest and feed, himself keeping a
watch round about. it was very hot and some of the rabbits were showing signs of
exhaustion. woundwort formed these into a separate group and took charge of it
himself.
     by the early evening -- about the same time as dandelion was beginning the
story of rowsby woof -- the efrafans had skirted an enclosure of pigs east of
cannon heath farm and were slipping into the combe south of cannon heath
down. many were tired and, in spite of their tremendous respect for woundwort,
there was a certain feeling that they had come a long way from home. they were
ordered to take cover, feed, rest and wait for sunset.
     the place was deserted, except for yellowhammers and a few mice pattering
about in the sun. some of the rabbits

     the wind blew, the trees shook their myriads of leaves. the stream was gone.
he was in the honeycomb, facing bigwig in the dark, across the motionless body
of fiver. the scratching from above was louder and closer.
     "bigwig," said hazel, "do as i say at once, there's a good fellow. we've got
hardly any time. go and get dandelion and blackberry and bring them to me at
the foot of kehaar's run, quickly."
     at the foot of the run buckthorn was still in his place. he had not moved at
fiver's cry, but his breath was short and his pulse very quick. he and the other
three rabbits gathered about hazel without a word.
     "i've got a plan," said hazel. "if it works, it'll finish woundwort for good and
all. but i've no time to explain. every moment counts now. dandelion and

     "but where are you going, hazel?" asked bigwig.
     "to the farm," said hazel, "to gnaw another rope. now, you two, follow me up
the run: and don't forget, you stop for nothing until you're down the hill. if there
are rabbits outside, don't fight -- run."
     without another word he dashed up the tunnel and out into the wood, with
blackberry and dandelion on his heels.

     at that moment general woundwort, out on the open grass below the bank,
was facing thistle and ragwort in the checkered yellow moonlight of the small
hours.
     "you weren't put at the mouth of that run to listen," he said. "you were put
there to stop anyone breaking out. you had no business to leave it. get back at

s upon the darker stubble,
tenting over the bristling stalks and the weeds of harvest -- knotgrass and
pimpernel, fluellen and speedwell, heartsease and persicary -- colorless and still
in the old moonlight. between the lines of straw the expanse of stubble was as
open as the down.
     "now," said hazel, as they came out from the belt of hawthorn and dogwood
where the pylon stood, "are you both sure you understand what we're going to
do?"
     "it's a tall order, isn't it, hazel-rah?" answered dandelion. "but we've got to try
it, that's certain. there's nothing else that'll save the warren now."
     "come on, then," said hazel. "the going's easy, anyway -- half as far now the
field's been cut. don't bother about cover -- just run in the open. keep with me,
though. i'll go as fast as i can."
     they crossed the field easily enough, dandelion running ahead. the only alarm
came when they startled four partridges, which whirred away over the hedge to
the west and sailed down, spread-winged, int

     blackberry burrowed his way into the moss and ivy round the base of the
thorn. the other two crossed the road and made uphill toward the sheds beside
the lane.
     "good roots they keep there," said hazel, as they passed them and reached the
hedge. "pity we've no time just now. when this is over we'll have a nice, quiet raid
on the place."
     "i hope we do, hazel-rah," said dandelion. "are you going straight up the lane?
what about cats?"
     "it's the quickest way," said hazel. "that's all that matters now."
     by this time the first light was clear and several larks were up. as they
approached the great ring of elm trees, they heard once more the quick sighing
and rustling above them and one yellow leaf came spinning down to the edge of
the ditch. they reached the top of the slope and saw before them the barns and
the farmyard. bird-song was breaking out all round and

the rooks were calling
from high in the elms, but nothing -- not even a sparrow -- moved on the ground.
straight in front, on the other side of the farmyard, close to the house, stood the
dog kennel. the dog was not to be seen, but the rope, tied to the eye bolt on the
flat roof, trailed over the edge and disappeared across the straw-covered
threshold.
     "we're in time," said hazel. "the brute's still asleep. now, dandelion, you
mustn't make any mistake. you lie in the grass just there, opposite the kennel.
when the rope's gnawed through you'll see it fall. unless the dog's ill or deaf, it'll
be alert by then; probably before, i'm afraid, but that's my lookout. it's up to you
to attract it and make it chase you all the way down to the road. you're very fast.
take care it doesn't lose you. use the hedges if you want to; but remember it'll be
trailing the rope. get it down to blackberry. that's all that matters."

   "if we ever meet again, hazel-rah," said dandelion, as he took cover in the
grass verge, "we ought to have the makings of the best story ever."
     "and you'll be the chap to tell it," said hazel. he moved away in a half-circle to
the morning side and reached the wall of the farmhouse. then he began to hop
cautiously along the wall, in and out of the narrow flower bed. his head was a
tumult of smells -- phlox in bloom, ashes, cow dung, dog, cat, hens, stagnant
water. he came to the back of the kennel, reeking of creosote and of rank straw. a

 the clean inside was showing. his
chisel-like foreteeth bit steadily and he felt the dry strands rip. the cord was as
good as half through already.
     at that moment he felt the heavy weight of the dog move beneath him. it
stretched, shuddered and yawned. the rope moved a little and the straw rustled.
the foul smell of it came strong, in a cloud.
     "it doesn't matter if it hears me now," thought hazel. "if only i can get the rope

be quick enough to make sure that the rope breaks when it begins to tug."
     he ripped at the cord again and sat back for a quick breath, looking across the
track to where dandelion was waiting. then he froze and stared. a short distance
behind dandelion, in the grass, was the white-chested tabby, wide-eyed, tail
lashing, crouching. it had seen both himself and dandelion. as he watched, it
crept a length nearer. dandelion was lying still, watching the front of the kennel

ly, as he had been told. the cat tensed itself to spring.
     before he knew what he was doing, hazel stamped on the hollow roof. twice
he stamped and then turned to leap to the ground and run. dandelion, reacting
instantly, shot out of the grass to the open gravel. in the same moment, the cat
jumped and landed exactly where he had been lying. the dog gave two quick,
sharp barks and rushed out of the kennel. it saw dandelion at once and ran to the
full extent of the rope. the rope went taut, held for an instant and then parted at
the point where hazel had gnawed it to a thread. the kennel jerked forward,
tilted, fell back and struck the ground with a jolt. hazel, already off balance,
clawed at the blanket, missed his footing and fell over the edge. he landed heavily
on his weak leg and lay kicking. the dog was gone.
     hazel stopped kicking and lay still. there was a spurt of pain along his haunch,
but he knew th

     there was not a rabbit in the owsla but had confidence in woundwort. as they
heard him preparing to go first into the depths of the enemy warren as calmly as
though he were looking for dandelions, his officers' spirits rose. it seemed to
them quite likely that the place would be given up without any fighting at all.
when the general had led the final assault at nutley copse he had killed three
rabbits underground and no more had dared to oppose him, although there had
been some hard tussles in the outer runs the day before.
     "very well," said woundwort. "now, i don't want anyone straying away.

inside, y

 bigwig, the blood oozing from his back and ear,

shape of general woundwort faintly outlined where he crouched above him. the
first traces of daylight were glimmering through the broken roof of the
honeycomb behind.

     when hazel stamped, dandelion leaped instinctively from the grass verge. if
there had been a hole he would have made for it. for the briefest instant he
looked up and down the gravel. then the dog was rushing upon him and he
turned and made for the raised barn. but before he reached it he realized that he
must not take refuge under the floor. if he did, the dog would check: very likely a
man would call it back. he had to get it out of the farmyard and down to the road.
he altered direction and raced up the lane toward the e

lane and the man will call it off, or else i shall have to lose it by going through the
hedge: then the whole plan will fail."
     he tore over the crest and down toward the cattle shed. when hazel had told
him what he was to do, it had seemed to him that his task would consist of
leading the dog on and persuading it to follow him. now he was running simply
to save his life, and that at a speed he had never touched before, a speed he knew
he could not keep up.
     in actual fact dandelion covered three hundred yards to the cattle shed in a
good deal less than half a minute. but as he reached the straw at the entrance it
seemed to him that he had run forever. hazel and the farmyard were long, long
ago. he had never done anything in his life but run in terror down the lane,
feeling the dog's breath at his haunches. inside the gate a big rat ran across in
front of him and the dog checked at it for a moment. dandelion gained the
nearest shed and went headlong between two bales of st

raw at the foot of a pile. it
was a narrow place and he turned round only with some difficulty. the dog was
immediately outside, scratching eagerly, whining and throwing up loose straw as
it sniffed along the foot of the bales.
     "sit tight," said a young rat, from the straw close beside him. "it'll be off in a
minute. they're not like cats, you know."
     "that's the trouble," said dandelion, panting and rolling the whites of his eyes.
"it mustn't lose me; and time's everything."
     "what?" said the rat, puzzled. "what you say?"
     without answering, dandelion slipped along to another crack, gathered
himself a moment and then broke cover, running across the yard to the opposite
shed. it was open-fronted and he went straight through to the boarding along the
back. there was a gap under the broken end of a board and here he crept into the
field beyond. the dog, following, thrust

its head into the gap and pushed, barking
with excitement. gradually the loose board levered open like a trapdoor until it

was able to force its way through.
     now that he had a better start, dandelion kept in the open and ran down the
field to the hedge beside the road. he knew he was slower, but the dog seemed
slower, too. choosing a thick part, he went through the hedge and crossed the
road. blackberry came to meet him, scuttering down the further bank. dandelion
dropped exhausted in the ditch. the dog was not twenty feet away on the other
side of the hedge. it could not find a big enough gap.
     "it's faster than ever i thought," gasped dandelion, "but i've taken the edge off
it. i can't do any more. i must go to ground. i'm finished."
     it was plain that blackberry was frightened.
     "frith help me!" he whispered. "i'll never do it!"
     "go on, quick," said dandelion, "before it loses interest. i'll overtake you and
help if i can."

once seemed to lose interest and returned to its nosing and sniffing over the
ground. finally, when he was utterly at a loss, it set off over the field of its own
accord, padding easily along beside one of the rows of threshed straw, trailing the
broken cord and pouncing in and out at every squeak and rustle. blackberry,
sheltering behind a parallel row, kept level with it. in this manner they covered
the distance to the pylon line, halfway to the foot of the down. it was here that
dandelion caught up with him.
     "it's not fast enough, blackberry! we must get on. bigwig may be dead."
     "i know, but at least it's going the right way. i couldn't get it to move at all, to
start with. can't we--"
     "it's got to come up the down at speed or there'll be no surprise. come on, we'll
draw it together. we'll have to get ahead of it first, though."
     they ran fast through the stubble until they neared the trees. then they turned
and crossed the dog's line in full view. this time i

     although woundwort had shown himself at the last to be a creature virtually
mad, nevertheless what he did proved not altogether futile. there can be little
doubt that if he had not done it, more rabbits would have been killed that
morning on watership down. so swiftly and silently had the dog come up the hill
behind dandelion and blackberry that one of campion's sentries, half asleep
under a tussock after the long night, was pulled down and killed in the instant
that he turned to bolt. later -- after it had left woundwort -- the dog beat up and
down the bank and the open grass for some time, barking and dashing at every
bush and clump of weeds. but by now the efrafans had had time to scatter and
hide, as best they could. besides, the dog, unexpectedly scratched and bitten,
showed a certain reluctance to come to grip

only thoughts throughout the warren were for hazel and bigwig. bigwig seemed
likely to die. bleeding in half a dozen places, he lay with closed eyes in the run he
had defended and made no reply when hyzenthlay told him that the efrafans
were defeated and the warren was saved. after a time, they dug carefully to
broaden the run and as the day wore on the does, each in turn, remained beside
him, licking his wounds and listening to his low, unsteady breathing.
     before this, blackberry and dandelion had burrowed their way in from
kehaar's run -- it had not been blocked very heavily -- and told their story. they
could not say what might have happened to hazel after the dog broke loose, and
by the early afternoon everyone feared the worst. at last pipkin, in great anxiety
and distress, insisted on setting out for nuthanger. fiver at once said that he
would go with him and together they left the wood and set off northward over the
down. they had gone only a short distance when fiver, sitting
