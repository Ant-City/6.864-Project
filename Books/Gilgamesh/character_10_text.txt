orm. furthermore, we are indebted
to dr. langdon for the identification of two sumerian fragments in the
nippur collection which deal with the adventures of gilgamesh, one in
constantinople, [12] the other in the collection of the university
of pennsylvania museum. [13] the former, of which only 25 lines are
preserved (19 on the obverse and 6 on the reverse), appears to be a
description of the weapons of gilgamesh with which he arms himself
for an encounter--presumably the encounter with humbaba or huwawa,
the ruler of the cedar forest in the mountain. [14] the latter deals
with the building operations of gilgamesh in the city of erech. a
text in zimmern's _sumerische kultlieder aus altbabylonischer zeit_
(leipzig, 1913), no. 196, appears likewise to be a fragment of the
sumerian version of the gilgamesh epic, bearing on the episode of
gilgamesh's and enkidu's relations to the goddess ishtar, covered in
the sixth and seventh tablets of the assyrian version. [15]

coming to the contents of the two tablets, the pennsylvania tablet
deals with the meeting of the two heroes, gilgamesh and enkidu,
their conflict, followed by their reconciliation, while the yale
tablet in continuation takes up the preparations for the encounter of
the two heroes with the guardian of the cedar forest, humbaba--but
probably pronounced hubaba [27]--or, as the name appears in the old
babylonian version, huwawa. the two tablets correspond, therefore,
to portions of tablets i to v of the assyrian version; [28] but,
as will be shown in detail further on, the number of _completely_
parallel passages is not large, and the assyrian version shows an
independence of the old babylonian version that is larger than we
had reason to expect. in general, it may be said that the assyrian
version is more elabo
