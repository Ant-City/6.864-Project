fatigue  jackets  and  trousers.  very  few  carried  underwear.  on  their  feet
they  carried  jungle  boots—2.1  pounds—and  dave  jensen  carried  three
pairs  of  socks  and  a  can  of  dr.  scholl's  foot  powder  as  a  precaution
against  trench  foot.  until  he  was  shot,  ted  lavender  carried  6  or  7
ounces  of  premium  dope,  which  for  him  was  a  necessity.  mitchell
sanders, the rto, carried condoms. norman bowker carried a diary. rat
kiley carried comic books. kiowa, a devout baptist, carried an illustrated
new testament that had been presented to him by his father, who taught
sunday  school  in  oklahoma  city,  oklahoma.  as  a  hedge  against  bad 
times,  however,  kiowa  also  carried  his  grandmother's  distrust  of  the
white  man,  his  grandfather's  old  hunting  hatchet.  necessity  dictated.
because  the  land  was  mined  and  booby-trapped,  it  was  sop  for  each
man to carry a steel-ce

the  things  they  carried  were  determined  to  some  extent  by
superstition. lieutenant cross carried his good-luck pebble. dave jensen
carried a rabbit's foot. norman bowker, otherwise a very gentle person,
carried  a  thumb  that  had  been  presented  to  him  as  a  gift  by  mitchell
sanders. the thumb was dark brown, rubbery to the touch, and weighed
4 ounces at most. it had been cut from a vc corpse, a boy of fifteen or
sixteen.  they'd  found  him  at  the  bottom  of  an  irrigation  ditch,  badly
burned,  flies  in  his  mouth  and  eyes.  the  boy  wore  black  shorts  and
sandals. at the time of his death he had been carrying a pouch of rice, a
rifle, an

here.

he put his hand on the dead boy's wrist. he was quiet for a time, as if
counting a pulse, then he patted the stomach, almost affectionately, and
used kiowa's hunting hatchet to remove the thumb.

henry dobbins asked what the moral was.
moral?
you know. moral.
sanders  wrapped  the  thumb  in  toilet  paper  and  handed  it  across  to
norman bowker. there was no blood. smiling, he kicked the boy's head,
watched  the  flies  scatter,  and  said,  it's  like  with  that  old  tv  show—

henry dobbins thought about it.

in part, he was grieving for ted lavender, but mostly it was for martha,
and for himself, because she belonged to another world, which was not
quite  real,  and  because  she  was  a  junior  at  mount  sebastian  college  in
new jersey, a poet and a virgin and uninvolved, and because he realized
she did not love him and never would.




like  cement,  kiowa  whispered  in  the  dark.  i  swear  to  god—boom,

down. not a word.

i've heard this, said norman bowker.
a pisser, you know? still zipping himself up. zapped while zipping.
all right, fine. that's enough.
yeah, but you had to see it, the guy just—
i heard, man. cement. so why not shut the fuck up?
kiowa  shook  his  head  sadly  and  glanced  over  at  the  hole  where
lieutenant  jimmy  cross  sat  watching  the  night.  the  air  was  thick  and
wet.  a  warm  dense  fog  had  settled  over  the  paddies  and  there  was  the
stillness that precedes rain.

after a time kiowa sighed.

that crying jag—the way he was carrying on—it wasn't fake or anything, it

say what you want, the man does care.
we all got problems.
not lavender.
no, i guess not, bowker said. do me a favor, though.
shut up?
that's a smart indian. shut up.
shrugging, kiowa pulled off his boots. he wanted to say more, just to
lighten  up  his  sleep,  but  instead  he  opened  his  new  testament  and
arranged  it  beneath  his  head  as  a  pillow.  the  fog  made  things  seem
hollow  and  unattached.  he  tried  not  to  think  about  ted  lavender,  but
then he was thinking

enjoyed not being dead. lying there, kiowa admired lieutenant jimmy
cross's capacity for grief. he wanted to share the man's pain, he wanted



to  care  as  jimmy  cross  cared.  and  yet  when  he  closed  his  eyes,  all  he
could  think  was  boom-down,  and  all  he  could  feel  was  the  pleasure  of
having his boots off and the fog curling in around him and the damp soil
and the bible smells and the plush comfort of night.

after a moment norman bowker sat up in the dark.
what the hell, he said. you want to talk, talk. tell it to me.
forget it.
no, man, go on. one thing i hate, it's a silent indian.



for the most part they carried themselves with poise, a kind of dignity.
now and then, however, there were times of panic, when they squealed

sounds and covered their heads and said dear jesus and flopped around

it's all exactly true.
it happened, to me, nearly twenty years ago, and i still remember that
trail junction and those giant trees and a soft dripping sound somewhere
beyond the trees. i remember the smell of moss. up in the canopy there
were  tiny  white  blossoms,  but  no  sunlight  at  all,  and  i  remember  the
shadows spreading out under the trees where curt lemon and rat kiley
were  playing  catch  with  smoke  grenades.  mitchell  sanders  sat  flipping
his yo-yo. norman bowker and kiowa and dave jensen were dozing, or
half dozing, and all around us were those ragged green mountains.

except for the laughter things were quiet.
at one point, i remember, mitchell sanders turned and looked at me,
not  quite  nodding,  as  if  to  warn  me  about  something,  as  if  he  already
knew, then after a while he rolled up his yo-yo and moved away.

lake road. on his third day home he'd seen her out mowing the lawn, still
pretty in a lacy red blouse and white shorts. for a moment he'd almost
pulled over, just to talk, but instead he'd pushed down hard on the gas
pedal. she looked happy. she had her house and her new husband, and
there was really nothing he could say to her.

the town seemed remote somehow. sally was remarried and max was

drowned and his father was at home watching baseball on national tv.

norman bowker shrugged. "no problem," he murmured.
clockwise, as if in orbit, he took the chevy on another seven-mile turn

around the lake.

even  in  late  afternoon  the  day  was  hot.  he  turned  on  the  air
conditioner, then the radio, and he leaned back and let the cold air and
music  blow  over  him.  along  the  road,  kicking  stones  in  front  of  them,
two young boys were hiking with knapsacks and toy rifles and canteens.
he honked going by, but neither boy looked up. already he had passed
the

meant  he  had  been  there  as  a  real  soldier  and  had  done  all  the  things
soldiers do, and therefore it wasn't such a big deal that he could not bring
himself to be uncommonly brave.

and  then  he  would  have  talked  about  the  medal  he  did  not  win  and

why he did not win it.

"i almost won the silver star," he would have said.
"how's that?"



"just a story."
"so tell me," his father would have said.
slowly then, circling the lake, norman bowker would have started by
describing the song tra bong. "a river," he would've said, "this slow flat
muddy  river."  he  would've  explained  how  during  the  dry  season  it  was
exactly  like  any  other  river,  nothing  special,  but  how  in  october  the
monsoons began and the whole situation changed. for a solid week the
rains never stopped, not once, and so after a few days the song tra bong
overflowed  its  banks  and  the  land  turned  into  a  deep,  thick  muck  for  a

just  sink  in.  you'd  feel  it  ooze  up  over  your  body  and  sort  of  suck  you
down. and the whole time there was that constant rain. i mean, it never
stopped, not ever."

"sounds  pretty  wet,"  his  father  would've  said,  pausing  briefly.  "so

what happened?"

"you really want to hear this?"
"hey, i'm your father."
norman bowker smiled. he looked out across the lake and imagined
the  feel  of  his  tongue  against  the  truth.  "well,  this  one  time,  this  one
night out by the river ... i wasn't very brave."

"you have seven medals."
"sure."
"seven. count 'em. you weren't a coward either."
"well, maybe not. but i had the chance and i blew it. the stink, that's

what got to me. i couldn't take that goddamn awful smell."

"i do want to."

 place looked as if it had been hit by nerve gas,
everything still and lifeless, even the people. the town could not talk, and
would not listen. "how'd you like to hear about the war?" he might have
asked,  but  the  place  could  only  blink  and  shrug.  it  had  no  memory,
therefore no guilt. the taxes got paid and the votes got counted and the
agencies of government did their work briskly and politely. it was a brisk,
polite town. it did not know shit about shit, and did not care to know.

norman bowker leaned back and considered what he might've said on
the subject. he knew shit. it was his specialty. the smell, in particular,
but also the numerous varieties of texture and taste. someday he'd give a
lecture  on  the  topic.  put  on  a  suit  and  tie  and  stand  up  in  front  of  the
kiwanis  club  and  tell  the  fuckers  about  all  the  wonderful  shit  he  knew.
pass out samples, maybe.

smiling at this, he clamped the steering wheel slightly right of center,
which  produced  a  smooth

particular, but max had become a pure idea, which was its own irony. it
was just too bad. if his father were here, riding shotgun around the lake,
the  old  man  might  have  glanced  over  for  a  second,  understanding
perfectly well that it was not a question of offensive language but of fact.
his father would have sighed and folded his arms and waited.

could've won the silver star for valor."

the  chevy  rolled  smoothly  across  a  viaduct  and  up  the  narrow  tar
road. to the right was open lake. to the left, across the road, most of the
lawns  were  scorched  dry  like  october  corn.  hopelessly,  round  and
round, a rotating sprinkler scattered lake water on dr. mason's vegetable
garden. already the prairie had been baked dry, but in august

  in  his  lungs—and  he  could  no  longer
tolerate it. not here, he thought. not like this. he released kiowa's boot
and  watched  it  slide  away.  slowly,  working  his  way  up,  he  hoisted
himself out of the deep mud, and then he lay still and tasted the shit in
his mouth and closed his eyes and listened to the rain and explosions and
bubbling sounds.
he was alone.
he had lost his weapon but it did not matter. all he wanted was a bath.
nothing else. a hot soapy bath.
circling the lake, norman bowker remembered how his friend kiowa

had disappeared under the waste and water.

"i  didn't  flip  out,"  he  would've  said.  "i  was  cool.  if  things  had  gone

right, if it hadn't been for that smell, i could've won the silver star."

a good war story, he thought, but it was not a war for war stories, nor
for talk of valor, and nobody in town wanted to know about the terrible
stink.  they  wanted  good  intentions  and  good  deeds.  but  the  town  was
not to blame, really. it was a nice lit

she put out her hand and tapped an intercom attached to a steel post.

she  stared  at  him  for  a  moment.  briefly,  he  thought,  a  question
lingered in her fuzzy eyes, but then she turned and punched the button
for him and returned to her friends in the firebird.

the intercom squeaked and said, "order."
"mama burger and fries," norman bowker said.
"affirmative, copy clear. no rootie-tootie?"



"rootie-tootie?"
"you know, man—root beer.

"all done."
"that's it?"
"i guess so."
"hey, loosen up," the voice said. "what you really need, friend?"
norman bowker smiled.

he stopped and shook his head.

remembered how he had taken hold of kiowa's boot and pulled hard, but
how the smell was simply too much, and how he'd backed off and in that
way had lost the silver star.

he wished he could've explained some of this. how he had been braver
than he ever thought possible, but how he had not been so brave as he
wanted to be. the distinction was important. max arnold, who loved fine
lines,  would've  appreciated  it.  and  his  father,  who  already  knew,
would've nodded.

"the truth," norman bowker would've said, "is i let the guy go."
"maybe he was already gone."
"he wasn't."
"but maybe."
"no, i could feel it. he wasn't. some things you can feel."
his father would have been quiet for a while, watching the headlights

nonstop  through  my  writing.  telling



stories  seemed  a  natural,  inevitable  process,  like  clearing  the  throat.
partly catharsis, partly communication, it was a way of grabbing people
by  the  shirt  and  explaining  exactly  what  had  happened  to  me,  how  i'd
allowed  myself  to  get  dragged  into  a  wrong  war,  all  the  mistakes  i'd
made, all the terrible things i had seen and done.

i  did  not  look  on  my  work  as  therapy,  and  still  don't.  yet  when  i
received norman bowker's letter, it occurred to me that the act of writing
had led me through a swirl of memories that might otherwise have ended
in  paralysis  or  worse.  by  telling  stories,  you  objectify  your  own
experience. you separate it from yourself. you pin down certain truths.
you  make  up  others.  you  start  sometimes  with  an  incident  that  truly
happened,  like  the  night  in  the  shit  field,  and  you  carry  it  forward  by
inventing incidents that did not in fact occur but that nonethel

ess help to
clarify and explain.

in any case, norman bowker's letter had an effect. it haunted me for
more  than  a  month,  not  the  words  so  much  as  its  desperation,  and  i
resolved finally to take him up on his story suggestion. at the time i was
at  work  on  a  new  novel,  going  after  cacciato,  and  one  morning  i  sat
down and began a chapter titled "speaking of courage." the emotional
core  came  directly  from  bowker's  letter:  the  simple  need  to  talk.  to
provide a dramatic frame, i collapsed events into a single time and plac

nnesota—the  lake,  the  road,  the  causeway,  the  woman
in pedal pushers, the junior college, the handsome houses and docks and
boats and public parks—and carried it all a few hundred miles south and
transplanted it onto the iowa prairie.

the  writing  went  quickly  and  easily.  i  drafted  the  piece  in  a  week  or
two,  fiddled  with  it  for  another  week,  then  published  it  as  a  separate
short story.

almost immediately, though, there was a sense of failure. the details
of norman bowker's story were missing. in this original version, which i
still conceived as part of the novel, i had been forced to omit the shit field
and the rain and the death of kiowa, replacing this material with events
that better fit the book's narrative. as a consequence i'd lost the natural



counterpoint  between  the  lake  and  the  field.  a  metaphoric  unity  was
broken. what the piece needed, and did not have, was the terrible killing
power of that shit field.

as  the  novel  developed  over 
 
 ___________________________
 
something  about  the  story  had  frightened  me—i
was  afraid  to  speak  directly,  afraid  to  remember—and  in  the  end  the
piece  had been ruined by a failure to tell the full and exact truth about
our night in the shit field.

over the next several months, as it often happens, i managed to erase
the story's flaws from my memory, taking pride in a shadowy, idealized
recollection  of  its  virtues.  when  the  piece  appeared  in  an  anthology  of
short fiction, i sent a copy off to norman bowker with the thought that it
might please him. his reaction was short and somewhat bitter.

"it's  not  terrible,"  he  wrote  me,  "but  you  left  out  vietnam.  where's

kiowa? where's the shit?"

eight months later he hanged himself.
in august of 1978 his mother sent me a brief note explaining what had
happened. he'd been playing pickup basketball at the y; after two hours
he went off for a drink of water; he used a jump rope; his friends found
him hanging from a water pipe. there was no suicid

any  kind.  "norman  was  a  quiet  boy,"  his  mother  wrote,  "and  i  don't
suppose he wanted to bother anybody."


now, a decade after his death, i'm hoping that "speaking of courage"
makes good on norman bowker's silence. and i hope it's a better story.
although  the  old  structure  remains,  the  piece  has  been  substantially
revised, in some places by severe cutting, in other places by the addition
of  new  material.  norman  is  back  in  the  story,  where  he  belongs,  and  i
don't  think  he  would  mind  that  his  real  name  appears.  the  central
incident—our long night in the shit field along the song tra bong—has
been restored to the piece. it was hard stuff to write. kiowa, after

at  the  far  left  of  the  line,  azar  and  norman  bowker  and  mitchell
sanders waded along the edge of the field closest to the river. they were



tall  men,  but  at  times  the  muck  came  to  midthigh,  other  times  to  the
crotch.

azar kept shaking his head. he coughed and shook his head and said,
"man,  talk  about  irony.  i  bet  if  kiowa  was  here,  i  bet  he'd  just  laugh.
eating shit—it's your classic irony."

"fine," said norman bowker. "now pipe down."
azar  sighed.  "wasted  in  the  waste,"  he  said.  "a  shit  field.  you  got  to

admit, it's pure world-class irony."

the  three  men  moved  with  slow,  heavy  steps.  it  was  hard  to  keep
balance.  their  boots  sank  into  the  ooze,  which  produced  a  powerful
downward suction, and with each step they would have to pull up hard to
break the hold. the rain made quick dents in the water, like tiny mouths,
and the stink was everywhere.

he  felt  some  pity  come  on  him.  for  a  moment  the  day  seemed  to
soften. so much hurt, he thought. he watched the young soldier wading
through  the  water,  bending  down  and  then  standing  and  then  bending
down again, as if something might finally be salvaged from all the waste.

jimmy cross silently wished the boy luck.
then  he  closed  his  eyes  and  went  back  to  working  on  the  letter  to

kiowa's father.




across the field azar and norman bowker and mitchell sanders were
wading alongside a narrow dike at the edge of the field. it was near noon
now.

norman  bowker  found  kiowa.  he  was  under  two  feet  of  water.

nothing showed except the heel of a boot.

"that's him?" azar said.
"who else?"
"i don't know." azar shook his head. "i don't know."
norman  bowker  touched  the  boot,  covered  his  eyes  for  a  moment,

then stood up and looked at azar.
"so where's the joke?" he said.
"no joke."

 was hard to get traction; with each movement the
muck  would  grip  their  feet  and  hold  tight.  the  rain  had  come  back
harder  now.  mitchell  sanders  reached  down  and  found  kiowa's  other
boot, and they waited a moment, then sanders sighed and said, "okay,"
and they took hold of the two boots and pulled up hard. there was only a
slight give. they tried again, but this time the body did not move at all.
after the third try they stopped and looked down for a while. "one more
time," norman bowker said. he counted to three and they leaned back
and pulled.

"stuck," said mitchell sanders.
"i see that. christ."
they tried again, then called over henry dobbins and rat kiley, and
all  five  of  them  put  their  arms  and  backs  into  it,  but  the  body  was
jammed in tight.

azar moved to the dike and sat holding his stomach. his face was pale.
the  others  stood  in  a  circle,  watching  the  water,  then  after  a  time
somebody said, "we can't just leave him there," and the men nodded

 and
got  out  their  entrenching  tools  and  began  digging.  it  was  hard,  sloppy



work. the mud seemed to flow back faster than they could dig, but kiowa
was their friend and they kept at it anyway.

slowly,  in  little  groups,  the  rest  of  the  platoon  drifted  over  to  watch.
only lieutenant jimmy cross and the young soldier were still searching
the field.

"what we should do, i guess," norman bowker said, "is tell the lt."
mitchell  sanders  shook  his  head.  "just  mess  things  up.  besides,  the

man looks happy out there, real content. let him be."

after  ten  minutes  they  uncovered  most  of  kiowa's  lower  body.  the
corpse was angled steeply into the muck, upside down, like a diver who
had plunged headfirst off a high tower. the men stood quietly for a few
seconds. there was a feeling of awe. mitchell sanders finally nodded and
said,  "let's  get  it  done,"  and  they  took  h

t finished. there was the promise
now  of  finding  a  hootch  somewhere,  or  an  abandoned  pagoda,  where
they could strip down and wring out their fatigues and maybe start a hot
fire.  they  felt  bad  for  kiowa.  but  they  also  felt  a  kind  of  giddiness,  a
secret  joy,  because  they  were  alive,  and  because  even  the  rain  was
preferable  to  being  sucked  under  a  shit  field,  and  because  it  was  all  a
matter of luck and happenstance.

azar sat down on the dike next to norman bowker.
"listen," he said. "those dumb jokes—i didn't mean anything."
"we all say things."
"yeah, but when i saw the guy, it made me feel—i don't know—like he

was listening."



"he wasn't."
"i guess not. but i felt sort of guilty almost, like if i'd kept my mouth

shut none of it would've ever happened. like it was my fault."

norman bowker looked out across the wet field.
"nobody's fault," he said. "everybody's."



near the center of the field first lieutenant jimmy cross squatted in

ridiculous little mustache.



the  nights  were  miserable.  sometimes  i'd  roam  around  the  base.  i'd
head down to the wire and stare out at the darkness, out where the war
was, and think up ways to make bobby jorgenson feel exactly what i felt.
i wanted to hurt him.


in march, alpha company came in for stand-down. i was there at the
helipad  to  meet  the  choppers.  mitchell  sanders  and  azar  and  henry
dobbins and dave jensen and norman bowker slapped hands with me
and  we  piled  their  gear  in  my  jeep  and  drove  down  to  the  alpha
hootches. we partied until chow time. afterward, we kept on partying. it
was  one  of  the  rituals.  even  if  you  weren't  in  the  mood,  you  did  it  on
principle.

by midnight it was story time.
"morty phillips used up his luck," bowker said.
i  smiled  and  waited.  there  was  a  tempo  to  how  stories  got  told.

bowker peeled open a finger blister and sucked on it.

"go on," azar said.

y," said dobbins. "not polio."
"well, hey," bowker said, "i'm just saying what jorgenson says. maybe
fuckin'  polio.  or  that  weird  elephant  disease.  elephantiasshole  or
whatever."

"yeah, but not polio."
across the hootch, sitting off by himself, azar grinned and snapped his
fingers.  "either  way,"  he  said,  "it  goes  to  show  you.  don't  throw  away
luck on little stuff. save it up."

"there it is," said mitchell sanders.
"morty was due," dave jensen said.
"overdue," sanders said.
norman bowker nodded solemnly. "you don't mess around like that.

you just don't fritter away all your luck."

"amen," said sanders.
"fuckin' polio," said henry dobbins.
we sat quietly for a time. there was no need to talk, because we were
thinking the same things: about morty phillips and the way luck worked
and didn't work and how it was impossible to calculate the odds. there
were  a  million  ways  to  die.  getting  shot  was  one  way.  booby  traps  and
land mines and gangrene and shock and polio from
