vening, was actuated by
any motive save her avowed one of returning the quilting frames she had
borrowed the preceding winter, it was an amiable weakness shared by most
of the avonlea people. many a thing mrs. lynde had lent, sometimes
never expecting to see it again, came home that night in charge of the
borrowers thereof. a new minister, and moreover a minister with a wife,
was a lawful object of curiosity in a quiet little country settlement
where sensations were few and far between.

old mr. bentley, the minister whom anne had found lacking in
imagination, had been pastor of avonlea for eighteen years. he was a
widower when he came, and a widower he remained, despite the fact that
gossip regularly married him to this, that, or the other one, every year
of his sojourn. in the preceding february he had resigned his charge and
departed amid the regrets of his people, most of whom had the affection
born of long intercourse for their good old minister in spite of his
shortcomings as an orator.

corner of the old cuthbert pew also had her opinions about them and
discussed the same in full with matthew, marilla always declining from
principle to criticize ministers in any shape or form.

“i don’t think mr. smith would have done, matthew” was anne’s final
summing up. “mrs. lynde says his delivery was so poor, but i think his

the matter of the haunted wood. besides, mrs. lynde says his theology
wasn’t sound. mr. gresham was a very good man and a very religious man,
but he told too many funny stories and made the people laugh in church;
he was undignified, and you must have some dignity about a minister,

feel she’s glad she’s a christian and that she’d be one even if she
could get to heaven without it.”

“i suppose we must have mr. and mrs. allan up to tea someday soon,” said
marilla reflectively. “they’ve been most everywhere but here. let me
see. next wednesday would be a good time to have them. but don’t say a
word to matthew about it, for if he knew they were coming he’d find some
excuse to be away that day. he’d got so used to mr. bentley he didn’t
mind him, but he’s going to find it hard to get acquainted with a new
minister, and a new minister’s wife will frighten him to death.”

“i’ll be as secret as the dead,” assured anne. “but oh, marilla, will
you let me make a cake for the occasion? i’d love to do something for
mrs. allan, and you know i can make a pretty good cake by this time.”

“you can make a layer cake,” promised marilla.
