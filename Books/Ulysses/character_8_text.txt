stately, plump buck mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. a yellow dressinggown,
ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. he
held the bowl aloft and intoned:

â€”introibo ad altare dei.

halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:

â€”come up, kinch! come up, you fearful jesuit!

solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. he faced about
and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the
awaking mountains. then, catching sight of stephen dedalus, he bent
towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat
and shaking his head. stephen dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned
his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking
gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light
untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.

buck mulligan peeped an insta

nt under the mirror and then covered the
bowl smartly.

â€”back to barracks! he said sternly.

he added in a preacherâ€™s tone:

â€”for this, o dearly beloved, is the genuine christine: body and soul and
blood and ouns. slow music, please. shut your eyes, gents. one moment. a
little trouble about those white corpuscles. silence, all.

he peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused
awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there
with gold points. chrysostomos. two strong shrill whistles answered
through the calm.

â€”thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. that will do nicely. switch off the
current, will you?

he skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering

t his legs the loose folds of his gown. the plump shadowed face and
sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.
a pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.

â€”the mockery of it! he said gaily. your absurd name, an ancient greek!

he pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,
laughing to himself. stephen dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily
halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as
he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and
lathered cheeks and neck.

buck mulliganâ€™s gay voice went on.

â€”my name is absurd too: malachi mulligan, two dactyls. but it has a
hellenic ring, hasnâ€™t it? tripping and sunny like the buck hims

we must go to athens. will you come if i can get the aunt to fork out
twenty quid?

he laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:

â€”will he come? the jejune jesuit!

ceasing, he began to shave with care.

â€”tell me, mulligan, stephen said quietly.

â€”yes, my love?

â€”how long is haines going to stay in this tower?

buck mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.

â€”god, isnâ€™t he dreadful? he said frankly. a ponderous saxon. he thinks
youâ€™re not a gentleman. god, these bloody english! bursting with money
and indigestion. because he comes from oxford. you know, dedalus, you
have the real oxford manner. he canâ€™t make you out. o, my name for you
is the best: kinch, the knife-blade.

he shaved warily over his chin.

â€”he was raving all night about a black panther, stephen said. where is
his guncase?

â€”a woful lunatic!

 mulligan said. were you in a funk?

â€”i was, stephen said with energy and growing fear. out here in the dark
with a man i donâ€™t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a
black panther. you saved men from drowning. iâ€™m not a hero, however. if
he stays on here i am off.

buck mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. he hopped down
from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.

â€”scutter! he cried thickly.

he came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into stephenâ€™s upper
pocket, said:

â€”lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.

stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a
dirty crumpled handkerchief. buck mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.
then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:

â€”the bardâ€™s noserag! a new art colour for our irish poets

: snotgreen.
you can almost taste it, canâ€™t you?

he mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over dublin bay, his fair
oakpale hair stirring slightly.

â€”god! he said quietly. isnâ€™t the sea what algy calls it: a great sweet
mother? the snotgreen sea. the scrotumtightening sea. epi oinopa ponton.
ah, dedalus, the greeks! i must teach you. you must read them in the
original. thalatta! thalatta! she is our great sweet mother. come and
look.

stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. leaning on it he looked
down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of
kings

r, stephen said gloomily.

â€”you could have knelt down, damn it, kinch, when your dying mother asked
you, buck mulligan said. iâ€™m hyperborean as much as you. but to think of
your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for
her. and you refused. there is something sinister in you....

he broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. a tolerant
smile curled his lips.

â€”but a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. kinch, the loveliest
mummer of them all!

he shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.

stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against
his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.

a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its
loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her
breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of
wetted ashes. across the thr

he folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the
smooth skin.

stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its
smokeblue mobile eyes.

â€”that fellow i was with in the ship last night, said buck mulligan, says
you have g. p. i. heâ€™s up in dottyville with connolly norman. general
paralysis of the insane!

he swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad
in sunlight now radiant on the sea. his curling shaven lips laughed and
the edges of his white glittering teeth. laughter seized all his strong
wellknit trunk.

â€”look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!

stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by
a crooked crack. hair on end. as he and others see me. who chose this
face for me? this dogsbody to rid of vermin. it asks me too.

â€”and to think of your having to beg from these swine. iâ€™m the only one
that knows what you are. why donâ€™t you trust me more? what have you

â€”let him stay, stephen said. thereâ€™s nothing wrong with him except at
night.

â€”then what is it? buck mulligan asked impatiently. cough it up. iâ€™m
quite frank with you. what have you against me now?

they halted, looking towards the blunt cape of bray head that lay on the
water like the snout of a sleeping whale. stephen freed his arm quietly.

she asked you who was in your room.

â€”yes? buck mulligan said. what did i say? i forget.

â€”you said, stephen answered, o, itâ€™s only dedalus whose mother is
beastly dead.

a flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to buck
mulliganâ€™s cheek.

â€”did i say that? he asked. well? what harm is that?

he shook his constraint from him nervously.

â€”and what is death, he asked, your motherâ€™s or yours or my own? you
saw only your mother die. i see them pop off every day in the mater and
richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. itâ€™s a beastly
thing and nothing else. it simply doesnâ€™t matter. you wouldnâ€™t kneel
down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. why?
because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only itâ€™s injected the
wrong way. to me itâ€™s all a mockery and beastly. her cerebral lobes
are not functioning. she calls the doctor sir peter teazle and picks

calm sea towards the headland. sea and headland now grew
dim. pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt
the fever of his cheeks.

a voice within the tower called loudly:

â€”are you up there, mulligan?

â€”iâ€™m coming, buck mulligan answered.

he turned towards stephen and said:

â€”look at the sea. what does it care about offences? chuck loyola, kinch,
and come on down. the sassenach wants his morning rashers.

his head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level
with the roof:

â€”donâ€™t mope over it all day, he said. iâ€™m inconsequent. give up the
moody brooding.

his head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of
the stairhead:

     and no more turn aside and brood
     upon loveâ€™s bitter mystery
     for fergus rules the brazen cars.

woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the
stairhead seaward where he gazed. inshore and farther out the mirror of
water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet

and no more turn aside and brood.

folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. memories beset his
brooding brain. her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had
approached the sacrament. a cored apple, filled with brown sugar,
roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. her shapely
fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the childrenâ€™s
shirts.

in a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its
loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,
bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.

ghoul! chewer of corpses!

no, mother! let me be and let me live.

â€”kinch ahoy!

buck mulliganâ€™s voice sang from within the tower. it came nearer up the
staircase, calling again. stephen, still trembling at his soulâ€™s cry,
heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.

â€”dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. breakfast is ready. haines is
apologising for waking us last night. itâ€™s all right.

â€”iâ€™m coming, stephen said, turning.

â€”do, for jesusâ€™ sake, buck mulligan said. for my sake and for all our
sakes.

warm sunshine merrying over the sea. the nickel shavingbowl shone,
forgotten, on the parapet. why should i bring it down? or leave it there
all day, forgotten friendship?

he went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,
smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.
so i carried the boat of incense then at clongowes. i am another now and
yet the same. a servant too. a server of a servant.

in the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower buck mulliganâ€™s gowned form
moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its
yellow glow. two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor
from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of
coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, tur

ning.

â€”weâ€™ll be choked, buck mulligan said. haines, open that door, will you?

stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. a tall figure rose from the
hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open
the inner doors.

â€”have you the key? a voice asked.

â€”dedalus has it, buck mulligan said. janey mack, iâ€™m choked!

he howled, without looking up from the fire:

â€”kinch!

â€”itâ€™s in the lock, stephen said, coming forward.

the key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been
set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. haines stood at the
doorway, looking out. stephen haled his upended valise to the table and
sat down to wait. buck mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside
him. then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set
them down heavily and sighed with relief.

â€”iâ€™m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... but, hush! not a
word more on that subject! kinch, wake up! brea

i canâ€™t go fumbling at the damned eggs.

he hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three
plates, saying:

â€”in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti.

haines sat down to pour out the tea.

â€”iâ€™m giving you two lumps each, he said. but, i say, mulligan, you do
make strong tea, donâ€™t you?

buck mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old womanâ€™s
wheedling voice:

â€”when i makes tea i makes tea, as old mother grogan said. and when i
makes water i makes water.

â€”by jove, it is tea, haines said.

buck mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:

â€”so i do, mrs cahill, says she. begob, maâ€™am, says mrs cahill, god send
you donâ€™t make them in the one pot.

he lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled
on his knife.

â€”thatâ€™s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, haines. five
lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fis

dundrum. printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.

he turned to stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his
brows:

â€”can you recall, brother, is mother groganâ€™s tea and water pot spoken of
in the mabinogion or is it in the upanishads?

â€”i doubt it, said stephen gravely.

â€”do you now? buck mulligan said in the same tone. your reasons, pray?

â€”i fancy, stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the
mabinogion. mother grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of mary ann.

buck mulliganâ€™s face smiled with delight.

â€”charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and
blinking his eyes pleasantly. do you think she was? quite charming!

then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened
rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:

     â€”for old mary ann
     she doesnâ€™t care a damn.
     but, hising up

 watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white
milk, not hers. old shrunken paps. she poured again a measureful and
a tilly. old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe
a messenger. she praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.
crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her
toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. they lowed
about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. silk of the kine and poor old
woman, names given her in old times. a wandering crone, lowly form of
an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common
cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. to serve or to upbraid,
whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.

â€”it is indeed, maâ€™am, buck mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.

â€”taste it, sir, she said.

he drank at her bidding.

â€”if we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat
loudly, we wouldnâ€™t have the country full

â€”are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.

â€”look at that now, she said.

stephen listened in scornful silence. she bows her old head to a voice
that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she

ou understand what he says? stephen asked her.

â€”is it french you are talking, sir? the old woman said to haines.

haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.

â€”irish, buck mulligan said. is there gaelic on you?

â€”i thought it was irish, she said, by the sound of it. are you from the
west, sir?

â€”i am an englishman, haines answered.

â€”heâ€™s english, buck mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak irish
in ireland.

â€”sure we ought to, the old woman said, and iâ€™m ashamed i donâ€™t speak the
language myself. iâ€™m told itâ€™s a grand language by them that knows.

â€”grand is no name for it, said buck mulligan. wonderful entirely. fill
us out some more tea, kinch. would you like a cup, maâ€™am?

â€”no, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the
milkcan on her forearm and about to go.

haines said to her:

â€”have you your bill? we had better pay her, mulligan, hadnâ€™t we?

stephen filled again the three cups.

â€”bill, sir? she said, halting. we

buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his
trouser pockets.

â€”pay up and look pleasant, haines said to him, smiling.

stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the
thick rich milk. buck mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in
his fingers and cried:

â€”a miracle!

he passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:

â€”ask nothing more of me, sweet. all i can give you i give.

stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.

â€”weâ€™ll owe twopence, he said.

â€”time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. time enough. good morning,
sir.

she curtseyed and went out, followed by buck mulliganâ€™s tender chant:

     â€”heart of my heart, were it more,
     more would be laid at your feet.

he turned to stephen and said:

â€”seriously, dedalus. iâ€™m stony. hurry out to your school kip and bring
us back some money. today the bards must drink and junket. ireland
expects that every man this day will do his duty.

â€”that reminds me, haines said, rising, that i have to visit your
national library today.

â€”our swim first, buck mulligan said.

he turned to stephen and asked blandly:

â€”is this the day for your monthly wash, kinch?

then he said to haines:

â€”the unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.

â€”all ireland is washed by the gulfstream, stephen said as he let honey
trickle over a slice of the loaf.

haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the
loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:

â€”i intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.

let us get out of the kip.

he stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying
resignedly:

â€”mulligan is stripped of his garments.

he emptied his pockets on to the table.

â€”thereâ€™s your snotrag, he said.

and putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,
chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. his hands plunged and
rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. god,
weâ€™ll simply have to dress the character. i want puce gloves and
green boots. contradiction. do i contradict myself? very well then, i
contradict myself. mercurial malachi. a limp black missile flew out of
his talking hands.

â€”and thereâ€™s your latin quarter hat, he said.

stephen picked it up and put it on. haines called to them from the
doorway:

â€”are you coming, you fellows?

â€”iâ€™m ready, buck mulligan answered, going towar

with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:

â€”and going forth he met butterly.

stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out
and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and
locked it. he put the huge key in his inner pocket.

at the foot of the ladder buck mulligan asked:

â€”did you bring the key?

â€”i have it, stephen said, preceding them.

he walked on. behind him he heard buck mulligan club with his heavy
bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.

â€”down, sir! how dare you, sir!

haines asked:

â€”do you pay rent for this tower?

â€”twelve quid, buck mulligan said.

ng forward again, raised his hands.

â€”the sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of dedalus, he said.

â€”i mean to say, haines explained to stephen as they followed, this tower
and these cliffs here remind me somehow of elsinore. that beetles oâ€™er
his base into the sea, isnâ€™t it?

buck mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards stephen but did not
speak. in the bright silent instant stephen saw his own image in cheap
dusty mourning between their gay attires.

â€”itâ€™s a wonderful tale, haines said, bringing them to halt again.

eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.

smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail
tacking by the muglins.

father.

hem, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had
suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. he moved
a dollâ€™s head to and fro, the brims of his panama hat quivering, and
began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:

     â€”iâ€™m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.
     my motherâ€™s a jew, my fatherâ€™s a bird.
     with joseph the joiner i cannot agree.
     so hereâ€™s to disciples and calvary.

he tugged swiftly at stephenâ€™s ashplant in farewell and, running forward
to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or
wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:

     â€”goodbye, now, goodbye! write down all i said
     and tell tom, dick and harry i rose from the dead.
     whatâ€™s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly

wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.

haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside stephen and
said:

â€”we oughtnâ€™t to laugh, i suppose. heâ€™s rather blasphemous. iâ€™m not a
believer myself, that is to say. still his gaiety takes the harm out of
it somehow, doesnâ€™t it? what did he call it? joseph the joiner?

â€”the ballad of joking jesus, stephen answered.

â€”o, haines said, you have heard it before?

â€”three times a day, after meals, stephen said drily.

â€”youâ€™re not a believer, are you? haines asked. i mean, a believer in
the narrow sense of the word. creation from nothing and miracles and a
personal god.

â€”thereâ€™s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, stephen said.

haines stopped to take out a smoot

s began...

stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not
all unkind.

â€”after all, i should think you are able to free yourself. you are your
own master, it seems to me.

â€”i am a servant of two masters, stephen said, an english and an italian.

â€”italian? haines said.

a crazy queen, old and jealous. kneel down before me.

â€”and a third, stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.

â€”italian? haines said again. what do you mean?

â€”the imperial british state, stephen answered, his colour rising, and
the holy roman catholic and apostolic church.

haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he
spoke.

â€”i can quite understand that, he said calmly. an irishman must think
like that, i daresay. we feel in england that we have treated you rather
unfairly. it seems history is to blame.

the proud potent titles clanged over stephenâ€™s memory the triumph of
their brazen bells: et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam:

buck mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. an elderly man shot up near
the spur of rock a blowing red face. he scrambled up by the stones,
water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water
rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black
sagging loincloth.

buck mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at haines
and stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips
and breastbone.

â€”better ask seymour that.

â€”seymour a bleeding officer! buck mulligan said.

he nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying
tritely:

â€”redheaded women buck like goats.

he broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.

he struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his
clothes lay.

the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. haines sat down on a

stephen handed him the key. buck mulligan laid it across his heaped
clothes.

a bag of figrolls lay snugly in armstrongâ€™s satchel. he curled them

â€”and the story, sir?

a swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork
of his satchel. he recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:

and as he stepped fussily back across the field his old manâ€™s voice
cried sternly:

â€”what is the matter? what is it now?

their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed
round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.

stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather
of its chairs. as on the first day he bargained with me here. as it was
in the beginning, is now. on the sideboard the tray of stuart coins,
base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. and snug in their spooncase

over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money
cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emirâ€™s turban, and
this, the scallop of saint james. an old pilgrimâ€™s hoard, dead treasure,
hollow shells.

a sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.

stephenâ€™s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. symbols too

misery.

mr deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the
shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: albert edward, prince of
wales.

he went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read
off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.

he peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow
and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly,
sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.

nationâ€™s vital strength. i have seen it coming these years. as sure

destruction. old england is dying.

his lifted arms waving to the air.

she was reading the card, propped on her elbow.

â€”she got the things, she said.

he waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back
slowly with a snug sigh.

â€”hurry up with that tea, she said. iâ€™m parched.

â€”the kettle is boiling, he said.

but he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled
linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.

as he went down the kitchen stairs she called:

â€”poldy!

â€”what?

â€”scald the teapot.

on the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. he scalded and
rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the
kettle then to let the water flow in. having set it to draw he took off
the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump

she set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on

bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoatâ€™s udder. the warmth
of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the
tea she poured.

a strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. in the

having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the
text with the hairpin till she reached the word.

â€”met him what? he asked.

â€”here, she said. what does that mean?

he leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.

â€”yes. whoâ€™s he when heâ€™s at home?

means the transmigration of souls.

â€”to be sure, poor fellow. so it is. what time?

â€”i must try to get out there, mâ€™coy said. eleven, is it? i only heard it
last night. who was telling me? holohan. you know hoppy?

â€”i know.

mr bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door
of the grosvenor. the porter hoisted the valise up on the well. she
stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her,
searched his pockets for change. stylish kind of coat with that roll
collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth. careless
stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets. like that haughty
creature at the polo match. women all for caste till you touch the spot.

warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. he saw his
trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward,
lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of
his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of
thousands, a languid floating flower.

before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back
to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. mr dedalus
fell back, saying:

â€”no, mr bloom said. he was alone.

mr bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. that book i must change

mr bloomâ€™s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the

a tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner
of elveryâ€™s elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.

mr dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:

mr power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the

mr bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companionsâ€™ faces.

â€”thatâ€™s an awfully good one thatâ€™s going the rounds about reuben j and
the son.

â€”about the boatman? mr power asked.

â€”yes. isnâ€™t it awfully good?

â€”what is that? mr dedalus asked. i didnâ€™t hear it.

him to the isle of man out of harmâ€™s way but when they were both.....

â€”what? mr dedalus asked. that confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?

â€”yes, mr bloom said. they were both on the way to the boat and he tried
to drown.....

â€”drown barabbas! mr dedalus cried. i wish to christ he did!

mr power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.

â€”no, mr bloom said, the son himself.....

martin cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:

loose and over the wall with him into the liffey.

â€”for godâ€™s sake! mr dedalus exclaimed in fright. is he dead?

â€”dead! martin cunningham cried. not he! a boatman got a pole and fished
him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father
on the quay more dead than alive. half the town was there.

â€”yes, mr bloom said. but the funny part is.....

â€”and reuben j, martin cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for
saving his sonâ€™s life.

the priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boyâ€™s
bucket and shook it over the coffin. then he walked to the other end and
shook it again. then he came back and put it back in the bucket. as you
were before you rested. itâ€™s all written down: he has to do it.

â€”et ne nos inducas in tentationem.

the server piped the answers in the treble. i often thought it would be
better to have boy servants. up to fifteen or so. after that, of course

holy water that was, i expect. shaking sleep out of it. he must be fed
up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.
what harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. every mortal
day a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in
childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls
with little sparrowsâ€™ breasts. all the year round he prayed the same
thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. on dignam
now.

the priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. corny
kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the
coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. corny kelleher
gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. all followed
them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. mr bloom came last
folding his paper again into his pocket. he gazed gravely at the ground
till the coffincart wheeled off to the left. the metal wheels ground the
gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the
trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.

breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little
in his walk. mr power took his arm.

â€”sheâ€™s better where she is, he said kindly.

â€”i suppose so, mr dedalus said with a weak gasp. i suppose she is in
heaven if there is a heaven.

corny kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to
plod by.

â€”sad occasions, mr kernan began politely.

mr bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.

â€”the others are putting on their hats, mr kernan said. i suppose we can
do so too. we are the last. this cemetery is a treacherous place.

they covered their heads.

â€”the reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, donâ€™t you think?
mr kernan said with reproof.

mr bloom nodded grav

mr bloom gave prudent assent. the language of course was another thing.

mr kernan said with solemnity:

every day. one fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. lots of

he looked behind through the others.

â€”what is he? he asked. what does he do? wasnâ€™t he in the stationery
line? i fell foul of him one evening, i remember, at bowls.

ned lambert smiled.

â€”yes, he was, he said, in wisdom helyâ€™s. a traveller for blottingpaper.

â€”in godâ€™s name, john henry menton said, what did she marry a coon like
that for? she had plenty of game in her then.

â€”has still, ned lambert said. he does some canvassing for ads.

john henry mentonâ€™s large eyes stared ahead.

the barrow turned into a side lane. a portly man, ambushed among the
grasses, raised his hat in homage. the gravediggers touched their caps.

â€”john oâ€™connell, mr power said pleased. he never forgets a friend.

mr oâ€™connell shook all their hands in silence. mr dedalus said:

â€”my dear simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. i donâ€™t want your
custom at all.

saluting ned lambert and john henry menton he walked on at martin
cunninghamâ€™s side puzzling two long keys at his back.

â€”did you hear that one, he asked them, about mulcahy from the coombe?

â€”i did not, martin cunningham said.

they bent their silk hats in concert and hynes inclined his ear. the
caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke
in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.

â€”they tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy
evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. they asked for
mulcahy from the coombe and were told where he was buried. after
traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. one of the
drunks spelt out the name: terence mulcahy. the other drunk was blinking
up at a statue of our saviour the widow had

the caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. he
resumed:

â€”and, after blinking up at the sacred figure, not a bloody bit like the
man, says he. thatâ€™s not mulcahy, says he, whoever done it.

rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with corny kelleher, accepting
the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.

â€”thatâ€™s all done with a purpose, martin cunningham explained to hynes.

mr bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.

â€”just a moment, mr crawford, he said. i just want to phone about an ad.

he went in.

the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.

he tossed the tissues on to the table.

screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was
flung open.

â€”hush, lenehan said. i hear feetstoops.

professor machugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin
by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the
steps. the tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air
blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.

â€”it wasnâ€™t me, sir. it was the big fellow shoved me, sir.

â€”throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. thereâ€™s a hurricane

he made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:

â€”the accumulation of the anno domini.

â€”sorry, mr bloom said.

he went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. j. j. oâ€™molloy slapped
the heavy pages over. the noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan,
echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps:

     â€”we are the boys of wexford

j. j. oâ€™molloy took the tissues from lenehanâ€™s hand and read them,

blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. look at the young scamps
after him.

â€”show. where? lenehan cried, running to the window. a street cortÃ¨ge

the editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow. he
declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor machugh:

      â€˜twas rank and fame that tempted thee,
      â€˜twas empire charmed thy heart.

the professor grinned, locking his long lips.

â€”eh? you bloody old roman empire? myles crawford said.

he took a cigarette from the open case. lenehan, lighting it for him
with quick grace, said:

â€”silence for my brandnew riddle!

â€”imperium romanum, j. j. oâ€™molloy said gently. it sounds nobler than
british or brixton. the word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.

that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives. a polished
period

j. j. oâ€™molloy resumed, moulding his words:

â€”he said of it: that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible,
of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy
which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought
in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live,
deserves to live.

his slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.

â€”fine! myles crawford said at once.

â€”the divine afflatus, mr oâ€™madden burke said.

â€”you like it? j. j. oâ€™molloy asked stephen.

stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed. he
took a cigarette from the case. j. j. oâ€™molloy offered his case to myles
crawford. lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy,
saying:

â€”muchibus thankibus. a man of high morale

â€”professor magennis was speaking to me about you, j. j. oâ€™molloy said t

stephen. what do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush
poets: a. e. the mastermystic? that blavatsky woman started it. she was
a nice old bag of tricks. a. e. has been telling some yankee interviewer
that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about
planes of consciousness. magennis thinks you must have been pulling a.
e.â€˜s leg. he is a man of the very highest morale, magennis.

speaking about me. what did he say? what did he say? what did he say
about me? donâ€™t ask.

â€”no, thanks, professor machugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.
wait a moment. let me say one thing. the finest display of oratory i
ever heard was a speech made by john f taylor at the college historical
society. mr justice fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had
spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days),
advocating the revival of the irish tongue.

he turned towards myles crawford and said:

â€”you know gerald fitzgibbon. then you can imagine the style of his
discourse.

â€”he is sitting with tim healy, j. j. oâ€™molloy said, rumour has it, on
the trinity college estates commission.

â€”he is sitting with a sweet thing, myles crawford said, in a childâ€™s
frock. go on. well?

â€”it was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator,
full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction i will
not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud manâ€™s contumely
upon the new movement. it was then a new movement. we were weak,
therefore worthless.

he closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised
an outspanned hand to h

in ferial tone he addressed j. j. oâ€™molloy:

â€”taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed. that he had
prepared his speech i do not believe for there was not even one
shorthandwriter in the hall. his dark lean face had a growth of shaggy
beard round it. he wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he
looked (though he was not) a dying man.

his gaze turned at once but slowly from j. j. oâ€™molloyâ€™s towards
stephenâ€™s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking. his
unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his
withering hair. still seeking, he said:

some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful moses.

his listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes
ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. and let our
crooked smokes. noble words coming. look out. could you try your hand at
it yourself?

â€”and it seemed to me that i heard the voice of that egyptian highpriest
raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride. i heard his words
and their meaning was revealed to me. from the fathers

it was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted
which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good
could be corrupted. ah, curse you! thatâ€™s saint augustine.

â€”why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our
language? you are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people. you

our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchan

arms. vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at
our name.

a dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. he lifted his voice above it
boldly:

â€”but, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful moses listened to and
accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will
and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have
brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed
the pillar of the cloud by day. he would never have spoken with the
eternal amid lightnings on sinaiâ€™s mountaintop nor ever have come down
with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in
his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw.

he ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence. ominousâ€”for him!

j. j. oâ€™molloy said not without regret:

â€”and yet he died without having entered the land of promise.

give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin
to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each

myles crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet
face, talking with j. j. oâ€™molloy.

offices of the irish catholic and dublin penny journal, called:

j. j. oâ€™molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently. they caught up

to look so they pull up their skirts... those slightly rambunctious

davy byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:

the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and
undramatic monologue, as shallow as platoâ€™s.

â€”people do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of
russell warned occultly. the movements which work revolutions in the
world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasantâ€™s heart on the
hillside. for them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the
living mother. the rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the
sixshilling novel, the musichall song. france produces the finest flower
of corruption in mallarmÃ© but the desirable life is revealed only to the
poor of heart, the life of homerâ€™s phÃ¦acians.

from these words mr best turned an unoffending face to stephen.

poems stephen mackenna used to read to me in paris. the one about

ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is shakespeare who
has studied hamlet all the years of his life which were not vanity in
order to play the part of the spectre. he speaks the words to burbage,
the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth,
calling him by a name:

â€”i hope mr dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of
the public. and we ought to mention another irish commentator, mr george
bernard shaw. nor should we forget mr frank harris. his articles on
shakespeare in the saturday review were surely brilliant. oddly enough
he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the

a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a

himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written romeo and juliet.

by chettle falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing. he sued a
fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound
of flesh in interest for every money lent. how else could aubreyâ€™s
ostler and callboy get rich quick? all events brought grist to his
mill. shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and

conscious begetting, is unknown to man. it is a mystical estate, an
apostolic succession, from only begetter to only begotten. on that
mystery and not on the madonna which the cunning italian intellect
flung to the mob of europe the church is founded and founded irremovably
because founded, like the world, macro and microcosm, upon the void.

grandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls. the son

banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds
uninterruptedly from the two gentlemen of verona onward till prospero

out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor

corny kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye
at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. he pulled himself erect,
went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass
furnishings. chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came
to the doorway. there he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes
and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.

father john conmee stepped into the dollymount tram on newcomen bridge.

corny kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat

constable 57c, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.

â€”thatâ€™s a fine day, mr kelleher.

a onelegged sailor crutched himself round macconnellâ€™s corner, skirting
rabaiottiâ€™s icecream car, and jerked himself up eccles street. towards
larry oâ€™rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:

â€”for england...

he swung himself violently forward past katey and boody dedalus, halted
and growled:

â€”home and beauty.

j. j. oâ€™molloyâ€™s white careworn face was told that mr lambert was in the
warehouse with a visitor.

a stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it
into the cap held out to her. the sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly
at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four
strides.

he halted and growled angrily:

the gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.
the blind of the window was drawn aside. a card unfurnished apartments
slipped from the sash and fell. a plump bare generous arm shone, was
seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. a
womanâ€™s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings. it fell on the
path.

one of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the
minstrelâ€™s cap, saying:

brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.

â€”why then not much, father cowley said. iâ€™m barricaded up, simon, with
two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.

as they trod across the thick carpet buck mulligan whispered behind his
panama to haines:

they chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose
beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.

â€”is that he? haines asked, twisting round in his seat.

â€”yes, mulligan said. thatâ€™s john howard, his brother, our city marshal.

john howard parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw
went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. an instant after, under
its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell
once more upon a working corner.

would be likely to be. such persons always have.

of retribution. rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. does

dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood

hear him lapping it up a mile off. and joe asked him would he have
another.

it was a historic and a hefty battle when myler and percy were scheduled
to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. handicapped as he

gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of
bennettâ€™s jaw. the redcoat ducked but the dubliner lifted him with a
left hook, the body punch being a fine one. the men came to handigrips.
myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with
the bulkier man on the ropes, myler punishing him. the englishman, whose

and excitement ran fever high. the referee twice cautioned pucking percy
for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch.
after a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of
the military man brought blood freely from his opponentâ€™s mouth the
lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to
battling bennettâ€™s stomach, flooring him flat. it was a knockout clean
and clever. amid tense expectation the portobello bruiser was being
counted out when bennettâ€™s second ole pfotts wettstein threw in the

her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the

come where the boose is cheaper.

â€”well, says j. j. we have edward the peacemaker now.

and bishops of ireland doing up his room in maynooth in his satanic
majestyâ€™s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his

â€”yes, says bloom.

â€”a nation? says bloom. a nation is the same people living in the same
place.

â€”by god, then, says ned, laughing, if thatâ€™s so iâ€™m a nation for iâ€™m
living in the same place for the past five years.

so of course everyone had the laugh at bloom and says he, trying to muck
out of it:

â€”or also living in different places.

â€”that covers my case, says joe.

â€”what is your nation if i may ask? says the citizen.

â€”ireland, says bloom. i was born here. ireland.

the citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and,
gob, he spat a red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.

the summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious
embrace. far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of
all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud
promontory of dear old howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on
the weedgrown rocks along sandymount shore and, last but not least, on
the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness
the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to
the stormtossed heart of man, mary, star of the sea.

spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with
bright merry faces and endearing ways about them. they were dabbling in
the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do,
or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long. and

to this golden rule. the apple of discord was a certain castle of sand
which master jacky had built and master tommy would have it right go
wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the
martello tower had. but if master tommy was headstrong master jacky was
selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little irishmanâ€™s house
is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the
wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle
too. needless to say the cries of discomfited master tommy drew the
attention of the girl friends.

jacky, for shame to throw poor tommy in the dirty sand. wait till i

shook her hand at master jacky the culprit and said if she was near him
she wouldnâ€™t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.

edy boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman
couldnâ€™t see and to mind he didnâ€™t wet his new tan shoes.

but who was gerty?

gerty macdowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought,
gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen
of winsome irish girlhood as one could wish to see. she was pronounced
beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was
more a giltrap than a macdowell. her figure was slight and graceful,
inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking
of late had done her a world of good much better than the widow welchâ€™s
female pills and she was much better

 of those discharges she used to
get and that tired feeling. the waxen pallor of her face was almost
spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine
cupidâ€™s bow, greekly perfect. her hands were of finely veined alabaster
with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments
could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves
in bed or take a milk footbath either. bertha supple told that once to
edy boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn

of fashion, and she had never regretted it. then there was blushing
scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you
have a beautiful face but your nose? that would suit mrs dignam because
she had a button one. but gertyâ€™s crowning glory was her wealth of
wonderful hair. it was dark brown with a natural wave in it. she had cut
it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about
her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails
too, thursday for wealth. and just now at edyâ€™s words as a telltale
flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she
looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety godâ€™s
fair land of ireland did not hold her equal.

for an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. she
was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.

f him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a
loversâ€™ quarrel. as per usual somebodyâ€™s nose was out of joint about the
boy that had the bicycle off the london bridge road always riding up
and down in front of her window. only now his father kept him in in the
evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was
on and he was going to go to trinity college to study for a doctor when
he left the high school like his brother w. e. wylie who was racing
in the bicycle races in trinity college university. little recked he
perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes,
piercing to the core. yet he was young and perchance he might learn
to love her in time. they were protestants in his family and of course
gerty knew who came first and after him the blessed virgin and then
saint joseph. but he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and
he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too

 she tried it on then, smiling at the
lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! and when she put
it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the
shine out of some people she knew. her shoes were the newest thing in
footwear (edy boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she
never had a foot like gerty macdowell, a five, and never would ash,
oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over
her higharched instep. her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect
proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of
her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and
wide garter tops. as for undies they were gertyâ€™s chief care and who
that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though
gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to
blame her? she had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery,
three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different

re on her because
the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father
brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because
she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that
morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that
was for luck and loversâ€™ meeting if you put those things on inside
out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it
wasnâ€™t of a friday.

and yet and yet! that strained look on her face! a gnawing sorrow is
there all the time. her very soul is in her eyes and she would give
worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving
way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings
though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the
mirror. you are lovely, gerty, it said. the paly light of evening falls
upon a face infinitely sad and wistful. gerty macdowell yearns in vain.
yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of

summer eve. with all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his

us two part, from this to this day forward.

and while edy boardman was with little tommy behind the pushcar she was
just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his
little wife to be. then they could talk about her till they went blue in
the face, bertha supple too, and edy, little spitfire, because she would
be twentytwo in november. she would care for him with creature comforts
too for gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that
feeling of hominess. her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and
queen annâ€™s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions
from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge
in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction,

she didnâ€™t like the eating part when there were any people that made her

lovely dog garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz

broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with
glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache
and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful
weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little
homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but
perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to
business he would give his

edy boardman asked tommy caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she
buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off
and play with jacky and to be good now and not to fight. but tommy said
he wanted the ball and edy told him no that baby was playing with the
ball and if he took it thereâ€™d be wigs on the green but tommy said it
was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if
you please. the temper of him! o, he was a man already was little tommy
caffrey since he was out of pinnies. edy told him no, no and to be off
now with him and she told cissy caffrey not to give in to him.

â€”youâ€™re not my sister, naughty tommy said. itâ€™s my ball.

but cissy caffrey told baby boardman to look up, look up high at her
finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and
tommy after it in full career, having won the day.

â€”anything for a quiet life, laughed ciss.

like that from everyone always petting him.

â€”iâ€™d like to give him something, she said, so i would, where i wonâ€™t

gerty macdowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of cissy
saying an unladylike thing like that out loud sheâ€™d be ashamed of her
life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and edy boardman said she was
sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. but not a pin cared
ciss.

her nose. give it to him too on the same place as quick as iâ€™d look at
him.

evening she dressed up in her fatherâ€™s suit and hat and the burned cork
moustache and walked down tritonville road, smoking a cigarette. there
was none to come up to her for fun. but she was sincerity itself, one of
the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced
things, too sweet to be wholesome.

and then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing
anthem of the organ. it was the menâ€™s temperance retreat conducted
by the missioner, the reverend john hughes s. j., rosary, sermon and
benediction of the most blessed sacrament. they were there gathered
together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying
spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the

reciting the litany of our lady of loreto, beseeching her to intercede
for them, the old familiar words, holy mary, holy virgin of virgins. how
sad to poor gertyâ€™s ears! had her father only avoided the clutches of
the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit
cured in pearsonâ€™s weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage,
second to none. over and over had she told herself that as she mused by
the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two
lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at
the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking. but that vile decoction
which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her
childhood days. nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of
violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to
the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was
one thing of all things that gerty knew it was that the man who lifts

ill at last master jacky who was really as bold as brass there was
no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he
could down towards the seaweedy rocks. needless to say poor tommy was
not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was
sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted
the ball. our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and
to avoid trouble cissy caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to
her please. the gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw
it up the strand towards cissy caffrey but it rolled down the slope and
stopped right under gertyâ€™s skirt near the little pool by the rock. the
twins clamoured again for it and cissy told her to kick it away and
let them fight for it so gerty drew back her foot but she wished their
stupid ball hadnâ€™t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she
missed and edy and cissy laughed.

on account of the gentleman opposite looking. she felt the
warm flush, a danger signal always with gerty macdowell, surging and
flaming into her cheeks. till then they had only exchanged glances of
the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a
look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan
and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.

through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted
and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of
original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray
for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. and
careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many
who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all
that bright with hope for the reverend father father hughes had told

the twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of
childhood are but as fleeting summer showers. cissy caffrey played with
baby boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. peep
she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and edy asked where was cissy
gone and then cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word,
didnâ€™t the little chap enjoy that! and then she told him to say papa.

â€”say papa, baby. say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.

and baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for
eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of
health, a perfect little bun

and two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. it was all
no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the
geegee and where was the puffpuff but ciss, always readywitted, gave
him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was
quickly appeased.

gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out
of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little
brats of twins. she gazed out towards the distant sea. it was like the
paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured
chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the
evening and the clouds coming out and the bailey light on howth and to
hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned
in the church like a kind of waft. and while she gazed her heart went
pitapat. yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his
look. his eyes burned into her

wasnâ€™t stagestruck like winny rippingham that wanted they two to always
dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had
an aquiline nose or a slightly retroussÃ© from where he was sitting. he
was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting
sorrow was written on his face. she would have given worlds to know what
it was. he was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the
ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if
she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down. she was glad
that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking
reggy wylie might be out but that was far away. here was that of which
she had so often dreamed. it was he who mattered and there was joy on
her face because she wanted him be

was like no-one else. the very heart of the girlwoman went out to him,
her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him. if he had
suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had
been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. even if he was a
protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved
her. there were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm. she was a
womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known,
those cyclists showing off what they hadnâ€™t got and she just yearned to
know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her,
make him forget the memory of the past. then mayhap he would embrace her

it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can
never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for
the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own
heart. gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained
glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners
of the blessed virginâ€™s sodality and father conroy was helping canon
oâ€™hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast
down. he looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and

she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a

white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell
the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hoursâ€™
adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or
perhaps an album of illuminated views of dublin or some place.

the exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and jacky
threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. little
monkeys common as ditchwater. someone ought to take them and give them
a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of
them. and cissy and edy shouted after them to come back because they
were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.

tching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didnâ€™t
because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger
mistake in all her life because gerty could see without looking that
he never took his eyes off of her and then canon oâ€™hanlon handed the
thurible back to father conroy and knelt down looking up at the blessed
sacrament and the choir began to sing the tantum ergo and she just swung
her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the tantumer
gosa cramen tum. three and eleven she paid for those stockings in
sparrowâ€™s of georgeâ€™s street on the tuesday, no the monday before easter
and there wasnâ€™t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at,
transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape
nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the
difference for himself.

cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with
her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did

settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses
was never seen on a girlâ€™s shouldersâ€”a radiant little vision, in sooth,
almost maddening in its sweetness. you would have to travel many a long
mile before you found a head of hair the like of that. she could almost
see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her
tingling in every nerve. she put on her hat so that she could see from
underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath
caught as she caught the expression in his eyes. he was eying her as a
snake eyes its prey. her womanâ€™s instinct told her that she had raised
the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept fro

no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of

â€”a penny for your thoughts.

â€”what? replied gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. i
was only wondering was it late.

because she wished to goodness theyâ€™d take the snottynosed twins and
their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just
gave a gentle hint about its being late. and when cissy came up edy
asked her the time and miss cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half
past kissing time, time to kiss again. but edy wanted to know because
they were told to be in early.

â€”wait, said cissy, iâ€™ll run ask my uncle peter over there whatâ€™s the
time by his conundrum.

so over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his
hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his

had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the
next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed
in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.

cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the
right time and gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it
and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his
watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the
sun was set. his voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in
measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the m

edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and gerty
noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect
because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place
to push up the pushcar and cissy took off the twinsâ€™ caps and tidied
their hair to make herself attractive of course and canon oâ€™hanlon stood
up with his cope poking up at his neck and father conroy handed him the
card to read off and he read out panem de coelo praestitisti eis and edy
and cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but
gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with
scathing politeness when edy asked her was she heartbroken about her
best boy throwing her over. gerty winced sharply. a brief cold blaze
shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable. it hurtâ€”o
yes, it cut deep because edy had her own quiet way of saying things

gertyâ€™s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back
the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully
moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of. she had loved him
better than he knew. lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex
he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant
there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. their eyes were
probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in
sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.

her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the
ringdove, but they cut the silence icily. there was that in her young
voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. as
for mr reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck
him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as
much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen
pieces. and if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one
look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot. miss
puny little edyâ€™s countenance fell to no slight extent and gerty could
see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering
rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had
struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was
something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and
never would be and there was somebody else

edy straightened up baby boardman to get ready to go and cissy tucked in
the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the
sandman was on his way for master boardman junior. and cissy told him
too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby
looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and cissy
poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as

she loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from bertha supple

it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean.

would she be to him and gild his days with happiness. there was the
allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or

silent as the grave, and it had made her his. at last they were left
alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could
be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible
honour to his fingertips. his hands and face were working and a tremour

they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and
she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was
flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. and she saw a

enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a
project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched
on. whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards

a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the
prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal
vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the
prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities
acquired. it grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch
defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable
females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their
flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly
bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might
multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of
their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he
assured them, made his heart weep. to curb this inconvenient (which

yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life
soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the

for his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a
diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these
latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both
broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum
chillies. after this homily which he delivered with much warmth of
asseveration mr mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with
which he had shielded it. they both, it seems, had been overtaken by the
rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be
observed by mr mulliganâ€™s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now
somewhat piebald. his project meanwhile was very favourably entertained
by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though mr dixon of
maryâ€™s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also
to carry coals to newcastle. mr mulligan however made court to the
scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt

contention: talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, o quirites,
ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici

centurionum romanorum magnopere anteponunt, while for those of ruder wit
he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable
to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard
drake and duck.

valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper
man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with
animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics
while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had
advanced. the young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a
passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his
nearest neighbour. mr mulligan, now perceiving the table,

 asked for whom
were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him
a civil bow and said, pray, sir, was you in need of any professional
assistance we could give? who, upon his offer, thanked him very
heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was
come there about a lady, now an inmate of horneâ€™s house, that was in an
interesting condition, poor body, from womanâ€™s woe (and here he fetched
a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. mr dixon,
to turn the table, took on to ask of mr mulligan himself whether
his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an
ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due,
as with the noted physician, mr austin meldon, to a wolf in the stomach.
for answer mr mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote
himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll
mimic of mother grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though

the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight. the spry
rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the
antechamber.

here the listener who was none other than the scotch student, a little
fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion
with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient
point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the
obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by
a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had
not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but
contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever
done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it.

the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the giver of good
things. with these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a
complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his
bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very
picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.

replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.

born. any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the
incorruptible eon of the gods. do you not think it, stephen? theosophos
told me so, stephen answered, whom in a previous existence egyptian
priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. the lords of the
moon, theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet alpha
of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these
were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second
constellation.

the debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the
course of life. neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. the
debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on
the loftiest and most vital. the high hall of horneâ€™s house had never
beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the
old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so
encyclopaedic. a gallant scene in truth it made. crotthers was there at

it had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted

must we accept the view of empedocles of trinacria that the right ovary

of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the
differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to
opine, such as culpepper, spallanzani, blumenbach, lusk, hertwig,
leopold and valenti, a mixture of both? this would be tantamount to

wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they

preparatory to anything else mr bloom brushed off the greater bulk of
the shavings and handed stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up
generally in orthodox samaritan fashion which he very badly needed. his
(stephenâ€™s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit
unsteady and

w such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten
to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman
service in the shaving line, they both walked together along beaver
street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrierâ€™s and the
distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of
montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence
debouching into amiens street round by the corner of dan berginâ€™s. but
as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a jehu plying for
hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some
fellows inside on the spree, outside the north star hotel and there was
no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when mr bloom, who was
anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting
a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.

this was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently
there was nothing for it but pu

which they accordingly did. so, bevelling around by mullettâ€™s and the
signal house which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the
direction of amiens street railway terminus, mr bloom being handicapped
by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had,
to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though,
entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made
light of the mischance. so as neither of them were particularly pressed
for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it
cleared up after the recent visitation of jupiter pluvius, they dandered
along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a
jarvey. as it so happened a dublin united tramways companyâ€™s sandstrewer

of the great northern railway
station, the starting point for belfast, where of course all traffic was
suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue
(a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more
especially at night) ultimately gained the dock tavern and in due course
turned into store street, famous for its c division police station.
between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of beresford
place stephen thought to think of ibsen, associated with bairdâ€™s the
stonecutterâ€™s in his mind somehow in talbot place, first turning on the
right, while the other who was acting as his fidus achates inhaled with
internal satisfaction the smell of james rourkeâ€™s city bakery, situated
quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of

an appearance in the court next day before mr tobias or, he being the
solicitor rather, old wall, he meant to say, or mahony which simply
spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about. the reason he mentioned
the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked,
were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the crown and, as mr
bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the a division in clanbrassil
street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. never on
the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, pembroke road for
example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious
reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes. another thing
he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of
any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to
inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over
anything. you frittered away

. stephen of his own accord stopped for
no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by
the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker
figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. he
began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having
happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered
that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his fatherâ€™s,
gumley. to avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway
bridge.

â€”someone saluted you, mr bloom said.

a figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches
saluted again, calling:

â€”night!

stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the
compliment. mr bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch
as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but
nevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety
though not funkyish in the least. though unusual i

twice in the junior at the christian brothers.

â€”i have no place to sleep myself, stephen informed him.

corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to
do with stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody
tart off the street. there was a dosshouse in marlborough street, mrs
maloneyâ€™s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but
mâ€™conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the brazen head over
in winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person
addressed of friar bacon) for a bob. he was starving too though he
hadnâ€™t said a word about it.

though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it
still stephenâ€™s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew
that corleyâ€™s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly
deserving of much credence. however haud ignarus malorum miseris

ever in another pocket he came
across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however,
as it turned out.

â€”those are halfcrowns, man, corley corrected him.

and so in point of fact they turned out to be. stephen anyhow lent him
one of them.

â€”thanks, corley answered, youâ€™re a gentleman. iâ€™ll pay you back one
time. whoâ€™s that with you? i saw him a few times in the bleeding horse
in camden street with boylan, the billsticker. you might put in a good
word for us to get me taken on there. iâ€™d carry a sandwichboard only

crossing sweeper.

subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six
he got he informed stephen about a fellow by the name of bags comisky

not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when.

the pair parted company and stephen rejoined mr bloom who, with his
practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the
blandiloquence of the other parasite. alluding to the encounter he said,
laughingly, stephen, that is:

â€”he is down on his luck. he asked me to ask you to ask somebody named
boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.

at this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, mr
bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the
direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of eblana,
moored alongside customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair,
whereupon he observed evasively:

â€”everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. now you mention it
his face was familiar to me. but, leaving that for the moment, how much
did you part with, he queried, if i am not too inquisitive?

â€”half a crown, stephen responded. i daresay he needs it to

diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on
yesterday. where does he live at present? i gathered in the course of
conversation that he had moved.

â€”i believe he is in dublin somewhere, stephen answered unconcernedly.

one and a born raconteur if ever there was one. he takes great pride,
quite legitimate, out of you. you could go back perhaps, he hasarded,

to them to give stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did.

there was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it
was, stephenâ€™s mindâ€™s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his
family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister dilly sitting by
the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak trinidad shell
cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he

possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.

adjacent to the menâ€™s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round
which a group of presumably italians in heated altercation were getting
rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly
animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.

facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. a few
moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner
only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection
of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo
already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation
for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.

to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the
shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.

or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes
apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual,
portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for
some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the
floor. mr bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having
just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be
sure, rather in a quandary over voglio, remarked to his protÃ©gÃ© in an
audible tone of voice Ã  propos of the battle royal in the street which
was still raging fast and furious:

â€”a beautiful language. i mean for singing purposes. why do you not write
your poetry in that language?

stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering
from lassitude generally, replied:

â€”to fill the ear of a cow elephant. they were haggling over money.

â€”is that so? mr bloom asked. of course, he subjoined pensively, at the
inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were
absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds
it.

the keeper of the shelter in the middle of this tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte put a
boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table
and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed. after
which he beat a retreat to his counter, mr bloom determining to have
a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to. for which
reason he encouraged stephen to proceed with his e

the redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded
stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely
by asking:

rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old
hollands and water.

eavesdropping too.

screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night
with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.

the entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there
being still a further egg.

the jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of
plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was
passed from hand to hand.

he fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to
be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table. the
printed matter on it stated: choza de indios. beni, bolivia.

all focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage
women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning,
sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of
them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.

oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not
licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he
could truthfully state, he, as a paterfamilias, was a stalwart advocate
of from the very first start. whoever embarked on a policy of the sort,
he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting
boon on everybody concerned.

might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told,

and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say
nothing of the antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage
of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who
expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described. on the
other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because
meeting unmistakable mugs, dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting
news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean
seas to draw the long bow about the schooner hesperus and etcetera. and
when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldnâ€™t

interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the
others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog,
collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. shipahoy of course
had his own say to say. he had doubled the cape a few odd times and
weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the china seas and through all
those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him

in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck. no aid was
given. her master, the monaâ€™s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead
would give way. she had no water, it appears, in her hold.

at this stage an incident happened. it having become necessary for him
to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.

gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.

duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and

ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of
it by england levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the

as they didnâ€™t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.

the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years
the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as

personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies,
equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly
advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even

saved his skin on. in any case that was very ancient history by now and
as for our friend, the pseudo skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently

the scaffold high. like actresses, always farewell positively last

had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told stephen
how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.

â€”he took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the
whole eventempered person declared, i let slip. he called me a jew and
in a heated fashion offensively. so i without deviating from plain facts
in the least told him his god, i mean christ, was a jew too and all his
family like me though in reality iâ€™m not. that was one for him. a soft
answer turns away wrath. he hadnâ€™t a word to say for himself as everyone
saw. am i not right?

he turned a long you are wrong gaze on stephen of timorous dark pride
at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to
glean in a kind of a way that it wasnâ€™t all exactly.

all those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up
bad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind,
erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were
very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of
everything greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.

he turned away from the others who probably and spoke nearer to, so as
the others in case they.

sense is, if you work.

over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this
synopsis of things in general, stephen stared at nothing in particular.
he could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those
crabs about ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours
of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere
beneath or seemed to. then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or
didnâ€™t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.

because it belongs to me.

some misapprehension. excuse me. unfortunately, i didnâ€™t catch the
latter portion. what was it you...?

stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of
coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding:

â€”we canâ€™t change the country. let us change the subject.

at this pertinent suggestion mr bloom, to change the subject, looked
down but in a quandary, as he couldnâ€™t tell exactly what construction
to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. the rebuke of some
kind was clearer than the other part. needless to say the fumes of
his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitt

the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine

part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the
time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the
selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.

so they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which
bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made
tracks arm in arm across beresford place. wagnerian music, though
confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for bloom and hard
to follow at the first go-off but the music of mercadanteâ€™s huguenots,
meyerbeerâ€™s seven last words on the cross and mozartâ€™s twelfth mass he
simply revelled in, the gloria in that being, to his mind, the acme of
first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a
cocked hat. he infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic

safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others

virtuosos, or virtuosi rather. there was the unanimous opinion that
there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of
worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced
desire for an encore. on the whole though favouring preferably light

had heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege

take a back seat. stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he

on the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond
the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground,
brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise bloom was not
perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive
guineas and john bull. he inquired if it was john bull the political
celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a
striking coincidence.

by the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, bloom,
who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the otherâ€™s sleeve
gently, jocosely remarking:

lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. but such
a good poor brute he was sorry he hadnâ€™t a lump of sugar but, as he
wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency
that might crop up. he was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a
horse, without a second care in the world. but even a dog, he reflected,

horror to face. but it was no animalâ€™s fault in particular if he was

the horse was just then. and later on at a propitious opportunity he

connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was
prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious

disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before
georgeâ€™s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than
the arc which it subtends.

of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?

music, literature, ireland, dublin, paris, friendship, woman,

did bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective
like and unlike reactions to experience?

both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to
plastic or pictorial. both preferred a continental to an insular manner
of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. both
indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of
heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox
religious, national, social and ethical doctrines. both admitted
the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual
magnetism.

were their views on some points divergent?

stephen dissented openly from bloomâ€™s views on the importance of dietary
and civic selfhelp while bloom dissented tacitly from stephenâ€™s views
on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of

son of odyssus, sent by pope celestine i in the year 432 in the reign
of leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of cormac macart (â€ 
266 a.d.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at sletty
and interred at rossnaree. the collapse which bloom ascribed to
gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of
adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and
the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, stephen
attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both
from two different points of observation sandycove and dublin) at first

he reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual
development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction
of the converse domain of interindividual relations.

as in what ways?

from inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received:
existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence
to nonexistence gone he would be by all

was it there?

it was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on
the day but one preceding.

why was he doubly irritated?

because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded
himself twice not to forget.

what were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly
(respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?

to enter or not to enter. to knock or not to knock.

bloomâ€™s decision?

a stratagem. resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the
area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at
the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its
length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches
of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by
separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for
the impact of the fall.

did he fall?

by his bodyâ€™s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in
avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated

hundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9,
dominical letters c b, roman indiction 2, julian period 6617, mcmiv.

did he rise uninjured by concussion?

regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by
the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force
at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied
at its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the
subadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free
inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame which,
by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a
portable candle.

what discrete succession of images did stephen meanwhile perceive?

reclined against the area railings he

perceived through the transparent
kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 cp, a man lighting a
candle of 1 cp, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man
leaving the kitchen holding a candle.

did the man reappear elsewhere?

after a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible
through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the
halldoor. the halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. in the open space
of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.

did stephen obey his sign?

yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed
softly along the hallway the manâ€™s back and listed feet and lighted
candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down
a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of bloomâ€™s
house.

what did bloom do?

flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearths

what in water did bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier,
returning to the range, admire?

its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature
in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of mercatorâ€™s
projection: its unplumbed profundity in the sundam trench of the pacific
exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface
particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence
of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic
quiescence in calm: its hydrok

.

what reason did stephen give for declining bloomâ€™s offer?

that he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by
submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month
of october of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of
glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.

what impeded bloom from giving stephen counsels of hygiene and
prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a

the incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.

what additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?

dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric
energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the
lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.

which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?

confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and
recuperation.

what concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the
agency of fire?

temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal

what announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?

a double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at
both sides simultaneously.

for what personal purpose could bloom have applied the water so boiled?

to shave himself.

what advantages attended shaving by night?

a softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from
shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly
encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours:
quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when

would be 38, as bloom then was, bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when
stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 bloom,
being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have
surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of methusalah,
969 years, while, if stephen would continue to live until he would
attain that age in the year 3072 a.d., bloom would have been obliged to
have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in
the year 81,396 b.c.

what events might nullify these calculations?

the cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a
new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent
extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.

employment of joseph cuffe of 5 smithfield for the superintendence of
sales in the adjacent dublin cattle market on the north circular road.

what instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him
in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?

in disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper
with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were greek and irish and
hebrew characters. she had interrogated constantly at varying intervals
as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of
a city in canada, quebec. she understood little of political
complications, internal, or balance of power, external. in calculating
the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid.
after completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned
the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to

polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by
false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), alias (a
mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).

what compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and
such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?

the false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all
balances, proved true by construction. the counterbalance of her
proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.

how had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?

variously. by leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a

what was stephenâ€™s auditive sensation?

he heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation
of the past.

what was bloomâ€™s visual sensation?

he saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a
future.

what were stephenâ€™s and bloomâ€™s quasisimultaneous volitional
quasisensations of concealed identities?

visually, stephenâ€™s: the traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted
by johannes damascenus, lentulus romanus and epiphanius monachus as
leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.

condense stephenâ€™s commentary.

one of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. once by
inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny. it comes when he
is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope
and youth, holds him unresisting. it leads him to a strange habitation,
to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him,
consenting.

why was the host (victim predestined) sad?

he wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him
should by him not be told.

why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?

in accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.

why was the host (secret infidel) silent?

he weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the
incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the
propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridi

mental or physical disorders was he not
totally immune?

from hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his
sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an
indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. from
somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and
crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained
its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain,
sleeping.

had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member
of his family?

twice, in holles street and in ontario terrace, his daughter millicent
(milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation
of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night
attire with a vacant mute expression.

what other infantile memories had he of her?

 why differently?

similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new

in other respects were their differences similar?

in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in

to stephen, noctambulist?

to pass in repose the hours intervening between thursday (proper) and
friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately
above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of
his host and hostess.

what various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation
of such an extemporisation?

for the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. for the
host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. for the
hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct italian
pronunciation.

why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and
a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent
eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a

what exchange of money took place between host and guest?

the former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (Â£
1-7-0), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to
the former.

what counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified,
declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?

to inaugurate a prearranged course of italian instruction, place
the residence of the instructed. to inaugurate a course of vocal
instruction, place the residence of the instructress. to inaugurate a
series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues,
places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in
the same place), the ship hotel and tavern, 6 lower abbey street (w. and

public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two
or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line
drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in
different places).

what rendered problematic for bloom the realisation of these mutually
selfexcluding propositions?

the irreparability of the past: once at a performance of albert
henglerâ€™s circus in the rotunda, rutland square, dublin, an intuitive
particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring
to a place in the auditorium where bloom, solitary, was seated and had
publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (bloom) was his
(the clownâ€™s) papa. the imprevidibility of the future: once in the
summer of 1898 he (bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches
on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and
received by j. and t. davy, family grocers, 1 charlemont

nequality and avarice and
international animosity.

he believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating
these conditions?

there remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct
from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of
destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of
the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and
death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human
females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable
accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies
and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital
criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make
terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres
of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital
growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through
maturity to decay.

with what meditations did bloom accompany his demonstration to his
companion of various constellations?

meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in
incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous
scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an
observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000
ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of sirius

ations of involution increasingly less vast?

of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the
earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed
in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds,
of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable
trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained
by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe
of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves
universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in
continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was
again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends
and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the
progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.

why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?

because some years previously in 1886 when oc

computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and

result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages
each of innumerable quires and reams of india paper would have to be
requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed
integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions,
billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series
containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost
kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.

of a different order of difficulty. conscious that the human organism,
normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons,
when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere
suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as
the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was
approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo,
when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a
working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more
adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might
subsist otherwise under martian, mercurial, veneral, jovian, saturnian,

his (bloomâ€™s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing
for possible error?

that it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not
a heavenman. that it was a utopia, there being no known method from
the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the
suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of
different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space,
remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a
present before its probable spectators had entered actual present
existence.

was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?

indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the
delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection
invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the
satellite of their planet.

did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological
influences upon sublunary disasters?

sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.

what special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and
woman?

her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian
generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence:
her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising
and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced
invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative
interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power

their gazes, first bloomâ€™s, then stephenâ€™s, elevated to the projected
luminous and semiluminous shadow.

similarly?

the trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations
were dissimilar: bloomâ€™s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of
the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate
year at high school (1880) had been capable of attaining the point
of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the

what significances attached to these two chairs?

significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial
evidence, of testimonial supermanence.

bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement,
remembering dr malachi mulliganâ€™s scheme of colour containing the
gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent
act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility
the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual
discolouration.

his next proceeding?

from an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black
diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on
a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the
mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus
(illustrated) entitled agendath netaim, unfolded the same, examined
it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the
candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the
latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin
of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such

what followed this operation?

the truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a
vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.

what homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the
mantelpiece?

a timepiece of striated connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46
a.m. on the 21 march 1896, matrimonial gift of matthew dillon: a dwarf
tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial
gift of luke and caroline doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of
alderman john hooper.

what interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and
bloom?

in the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the
dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. before
the mirror the matrimonial gift of alderman john hooper with a clear
melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded bloom

what composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his
attention?

the image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.

why solitary (ipsorelative)?

      brothers and sisters had he none.
      yet that manâ€™s father was his grandfatherâ€™s son.

why mutable (aliorelative)?

from infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.
from maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal
procreator.

what final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?

the optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged
and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles

what reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of
the inverted volumes?

the necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its
place: the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females:
the incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella
inclined in a closestool: the insecurity of hiding any secret document
behind, beneath or between the pages of a book.

which volume was
 
 ___________________________
 
 the largest in bulk?

hozierâ€™s history of the russo-turkish war.

what among other data did the second volume of the work in question
contain?

the name of a decisive battle (forgotten), frequently remembered by a
decisive officer, major brian cooper tweedy (remembered).

why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?

firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an
interval of amnesia, when, seated at the central table, about to consult
the work in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of the
military engagement, plevna.

what caused him consolation in his sitting posture?

the candour, nudity, pose, tranquility, youth, grace, sex, counsel of a
statue erect in the centre of the table, an image of narcissus purchased
by auction from p. a. wren, 9 bachelorâ€™s walk.

what caused him irritation in his sitting posture?

inhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 button

s), two
articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and
inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion.

how was the irritation allayed?

he removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible
stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table. he
unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt
and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hairs
extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over the
circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial
line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebrae,
thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles
described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits
of the mammary prominences. he unbraced successively each of six minus
one braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one incomplete.

what involuntary actions followed?

he compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in
the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting
inflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 may 1904) by a bee.
he scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of
prurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly
abluted skin. he inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of
his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1 shilling),
placed there (presumably) on the occasion (17 october 1903) of the
interment of mrs emily sinico, sydney parade.

what course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?

a course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour:
the dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes,
incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social inequality,
of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered with mitigants
of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the uttermost farthing
with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to the crown. loyal to
the highest constituted power in the land, actuated by an innate love of
rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance of public order,

had advocated during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of
colonial (e.g. canadian) expansion and the

evolutionary theories of
charles darwin, expounded in the descent of man and the origin of
species. in 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence to the
collective and national economic programme advocated by james fintan

the agrarian policy of michael davitt, the constitutional agitation of
charles stewart parnell (m. p. for cork city), the programme of
peace, retrenchment and reform of william ewart gladstone (m. p. for
midlothian, n. b.) and, in support of his political convictions, had
climbed up into a secure position amid the ramifications of a tree
on northumberland road to see the entrance (2 february 1888) into the
capital of a demonstrative torchlight procession of 20,000 torchbearers,
divided into 120 trade corporations, bearing 2000 torches in escort of
the marquess of ripon and (honest) john morley.

how much and how did he propose to pay

joining capital with opportunity the thing required was done.

what eventuality would render him independent of such wealth?

the independent discovery of a goldseam of inexhaustible ore.

for what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation?

it was one of his axioms that similar meditations or the automatic
relation to himself of a narrative concerning himself or tranquil
recollection of the past when practised habitually before retiring for
the night alleviated fatigue and produced as a result sound repose and
renovated vitality.

his justifications?

as a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human
life at least 2/7, viz. 20 years are passed in sleep. as a philosopher
he knew that at the termination of any allotted life only an
infinitesimal part of any personâ€™s desires has been realised. as a
physiologist he believed in the artificial placation of malignant
agencies chiefly operative during somnolence.

what did he fear?

why did bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?

because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain
beliefs and practices.

as?

the prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the
hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete
mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of
male infants: the supernatural character of judaic scripture: the
ineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath.

how did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?

not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rati

onal than
other beliefs and practices now appeared.

what first reminiscence had he of rudolph bloom (deceased)?

rudolph bloom (deceased) narrated to his son leopold bloom (aged 6) a
retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between
dublin, london, florence, milan, vienna, budapest, szombathely with
statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen maria theresia,
empress of austria, queen of hungary), with commercial advice (having
taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).
leopold bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant
consultation of a geographical map of europe (political) and by
suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the
various centres mentioned.

had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these
migrations in narrator and listener?

what idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of
amnesia?

occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat.
occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an
inclined plate. occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food
by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper.

what two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?

the myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon
repletion.

what object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?

possession of scrip.

with which attendant indignities?

contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread,
the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of
illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of
decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less

by what could such a situation be precluded?

by decease (change of state): by departure (change of place).

which preferably?

the latter, by the line of least resistance.

what considerations rendered departure not entirely undesirable?

constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of per

the habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated. the necessity
to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest.

what considerations rendered departure not irrational?

the parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which
being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if
not disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication,
which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting
parties, which was impossible.

what considerations rendered departure desirable?

the attractive character of certain localities in ireland and abroad,
as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or
in special ordnance survey charts by employment

cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic
planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of
space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events. somewhere
imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey
the summons of recall. whence, disappearing from the constellation of
the northern crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the
constellation of cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination
return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark
crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition)

of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?

the lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity
of the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares,
rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the
proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of
warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and
rendering desirable: the statue of narcissus, sound without echo,
desired desire.

what advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an
unoccupied bed?

the removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human
(mature female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation of
matutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in the
case of trousers accurately folded and placed lengthwise between the
spring mattress (striped) and the woollen mattress (biscuit section).

what recurrent impressions

how?

not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress
being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous
under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of

female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs,
some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.

if he had smiled why would he have smiled?

to reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to
enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if
the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first,
last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor

with what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections
affected?

envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.

envy?

of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the
superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic
piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of
a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental
female organism, passive but not obtuse.

jealousy?

because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately
the agent and reagent of attraction. because attraction between agent(s)
and reagent(s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of
increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial
reentrance. because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of
attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.

abnegation?

establishment of george mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 ede

quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and
reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of
ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d)
extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative,
e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net
proceeds divided.

equanimity?

with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar simila

as not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in

theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money
under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public
money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of
minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason,

practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field,

ry, poaching, usury, intelligence with the kingâ€™s enemies,

murder. as not more abnormal than all other parallel processes of
adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal
equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances,
foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant
disease. as more than inevitable, irreparable.

why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?

from outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but
outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially
violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the
adulterously violated.

what retribution, if any?

assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. duel by
combat, no. divorce, not now. exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic

for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of
injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly. hushmoney by moral
influence, possibly. if any, positively, connivance, introduction of
emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral,
a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation,
humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other,
protecting the separator from both.

by what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of
incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?

the preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility
of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between
the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the
selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred

what limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were
perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the
course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?

by the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been
celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8
september 1870), viz. 8 october, and consummated on the same date with
female issue born 15 june 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated
on the 10 september of the same year and complete carnal intercourse,
with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last
taken place 5 weeks previous, viz. 27 november 1893, to the birth on 29
december 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 january 1894,
aged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days
during which carnal intercourse had been incomplet

e, without ejaculation
of semen within the natural female organ. by the narrator a limitation
of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental
intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since
the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the
female issue of narrator and listener, 15 september 1903, there remained
a period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence of a
preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the
consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of
action had been circumscribed.

how?

by various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine

make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this
age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it
pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway
and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with
all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time
after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why
cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes
love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help
yourself i wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there
and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to
your soul almo

 no father and i always think of the real father
what did he want to know for when i already confessed it to god he had
a nice fat hand the palm moist always i wouldnt mind feeling it neither
would he id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar i wonder did he know
me in the box i could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed
never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre
lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone
them id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of
incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if
youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to h
h the pope for a penance i wonder was he satisfied with me one thing i
didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall
though i laughed im not a horse or an ass am i i suppose he was thinking
of his fathers i wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am i in

tell you theres no god what could you do if it was running and rushing
about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle i lit that
evening in whitefriars street chapel for the month of may see it brought
its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church
mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey
matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when i lit the
lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red
brute of a thing he has i thought the vein or whatever the dickens they
call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after i took
off all my things with the blinds down

laughing with the giggles i couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling
out one after another with the mass of hair i had youre always in great
humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it
meant because i used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us
not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault
she didnt darken the door much after we were married i wonder what shes
got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her
face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time i saw her she
must have been just after a row with him because i saw on the moment she

my drawers that was the evening coming along kenilworth square he kissed
me in the eye of my glove and i had to take it off asking me questions
is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so i let him keep it

beginning to be plump i said i was tired we lay over the firtree cove

galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and saint michaels
cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and
ladders all the mud plotching my boots im sure thats the way down the
monkeys go under the sea to africa when they die the ships out far like
chips that was the malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could
do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love

20 years if i said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and
put his hands over my eyes to guess who i might recognise him hes young
still about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is
quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she
little knows what i did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt
of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might
say they could have put an article about it in the chronicle i was a bit
wild after when i blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from benady
bros and exploded it lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons
screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill

wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy claddagh ring for
luck that i gave gardner going to south africa where those boers killed
him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as
if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must

in at 4 in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners
not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering
money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he
starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and findon haddy and hot
buttered toast i suppose well have him sitting up like the king of
the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg
wherever he learned that from and i love to hear him falling up the
stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play
with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake i wonder has she
fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but i hate their

tube from one woman to another i couldnt even change my new white shoes

blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of

to put up with it i never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved

and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in ennis like
all the things he told father he was going to do and me but i saw
through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the
honeymoon venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of como he
had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns o
how nice i said whatever i liked he was going to do immediately if
not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a

shes right not to ruin her hands i noticed he was always talking to her
lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to
understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he
cant say i pretend things can he im too honest as a matter of fact and
helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its

was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres
that of course she cant feel anything deep yet i never came properly
till i was what 22 or so it went into the wrong place always only the
usual girls nonsense and giggling that conny connolly writing to her in
white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when
the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had martin
harvey for breakfast dinner and supper i thought to myself afterwards
it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for
nothing i suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe
in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with
not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that
nowadays full up of each other

skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes
restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay
that way i was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing
answering me like a fishwoman when i asked to go for a half a stone of
potatoes the day we met mrs joe gallaher at the trottingmatches and she
pretended not to see us in her trap with friery the solicitor we werent
grand enough till i gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for
herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your

badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or i

barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar
way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a

hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might
