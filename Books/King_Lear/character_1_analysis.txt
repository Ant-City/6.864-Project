Cordelia
Cordelia's chief characteristics are devotion, kindness,
beauty, and honesty--honesty to a fault, perhaps. She is contrasted
throughout the play with Goneril and Regan, who are neither honest
nor loving, and who manipulate their father for their own ends.
By refusing to take part in Lear's love test at the beginning of
the play, Cordelia establishes herself as a repository of virtue,
and the obvious authenticity of her love for Lear makes clear the
extent of the king's error in banishing her. For most of the middle
section of the play, she is offstage, but as we observe the depredations
of Goneril and Regan and watch Lear's descent into madness, Cordelia
is never far from the audience's thoughts, and her beauty is venerably
described in religious terms. Indeed, rumors of her return to Britain
begin to surface almost immediately, and once she lands at Dover,
the action of the play begins to move toward her, as all the characters
converge on the coast. Cordelia's reunion with Lear marks the apparent
restoration of order in the kingdom and the triumph of love and
forgiveness over hatred and spite. This fleeting moment of familial
happiness makes the devastating finale of King Lear that
much more cruel, as Cordelia, the personification of kindness and
virtue, becomes a literal sacrifice to the heartlessness of an apparently
unjust world.
