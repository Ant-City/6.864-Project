the [CHARACTER] - 
                gulliver's
first master in brobdingnag. the [CHARACTER] speaks to gulliver, showing
that he is willing to believe that the relatively tiny gulliver
may be as rational as he himself is, and treats him with gentleness.
however, the [CHARACTER] puts gulliver on display around brobdingnag, which
clearly shows that he would rather profit from his discovery than
converse with him as an equal. his exploitation of gulliver as a
laborer, which nearly starves gulliver to death, seems less cruel
than simpleminded. generally, the [CHARACTER] represents the average
brobdingnagian of no great gifts or intelligence, wielding an extraordinary
power over gulliver simply by virtue of his immense size.
