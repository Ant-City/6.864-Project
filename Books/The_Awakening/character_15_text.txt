they took a short cut across the sands. at a distance they could see
the curious procession moving toward the wharf--the lovers, shoulder to
shoulder, creeping; the lady in black, gaining steadily upon them; old
monsieur farival, losing ground inch by inch, and a young barefooted
spanish girl, with a red kerchief on her head and a basket on her arm,
bringing up the rear.

robert knew the girl, and he talked to her a little in the boat. no one
present understood what they said. her name was mariequita. she had a
round, sly, piquant face and pretty black eyes. her hands were small,
and she kept them folded over the handle of her basket. her feet were
broad and coarse. she did not strive to hide them. edna looked at her
feet, and noticed the sand and slime between her brown toes.

beaudelet grumbled because mariequita was there, taking up so much room.
in reality he was annoyed at having old monsieur farival, who considered
himself the better sailor of the two. but he would not quarrel with

 old a man as monsieur farival, so he quarreled with mariequita. the
girl was deprecatory at one moment, appealing to robert. she was saucy
the next, moving her head up and down, making “eyes” at robert and
making “mouths” at beaudelet.

the lovers were all alone. they saw nothing, they heard nothing. the
lady in black was counting her beads for the third time. old monsieur
farival talked incessantly of what he knew about handling a boat, and of
what beaudelet did not know on the same subject.

edna liked it all. she looked mariequita up and down, f

l of robert.

“maybe she thinks you are pretty. shall i ask her?”

“no. is she your sweetheart?”

“she’s a married lady, and has two children.”

“oh! well! francisco ran away with sylvano’s wife, who had four
children. they took all his money and one of the children and stole his
boat.”

“shut up!”

“does she understand?”

“oh, hush!”

“are those two married over there--leaning on each other?”

“of course not,” laughed robert.

“of course not,” echoed mariequita, with a serious, confirmatory bob of
the head.

the sun was high up and beginning to bite. the swift breeze seemed
to edna to bury the sting of it into the pores of her face and hands.
robert held his umbrella over her. as they went cutting sidewise through
the water, the sails bellied taut, with the wind filling and overflowing
them. old monsieur farival laughed sardonically at something as he
looked at the sails, and beaudelet swore at the old man under his
breath.

sailing across the bay to

the cheniere caminada, edna felt as if she
were being borne away from some anchorage which had held her fast, whose
chains had been loosening--had snapped the night before when the mystic
spirit was abroad, leaving her free to drift whithersoever she chose
to set her sails. robert spoke to her incessantly; he no longer noticed
mariequita. the girl had shrimps in her bamboo basket. they were covered
with spanish moss. she beat the moss down impatiently, and muttered to
herself sullenly.

“let us go to grande terre to-morrow?” said robert in a low voice.

“what shall we do there?”

“climb up the hill to the old fort and look at the little wriggling gold
snakes, and watch the lizards sun themselves.”

she gazed away toward grande terre and thought she would like to be
alone there with robert, in the sun, listening to t

would know how to spend it. pirate gold isn’t a thing to be hoarded or
utilized. it is something to squander and throw to the four winds, for
the fun of seeing the golden specks fly.”

“we’d share it, and scatter it together,” he said. his face flushed.

they all went together up to the quaint little gothic church of our lady
of lourdes, gleaming all brown and yellow with paint in the sun’s glare.

only beaudelet remained behind, tinkering at his boat, and mariequita
walked away with her basket of shrimps, casting a look of childish ill
humor and reproach at robert from the corner of her eye.

a feeling of oppression and drowsiness overcame edna during the service.
her head began to ache, and the lights on the altar swayed before
her eyes. another time she might have made an effort to regain her
composure; but her one thought was to quit the stifling atmosphere of
the church and reach the open air. she arose, climbing over robert’s
feet with a m

e thrashed him well enough a year or two ago,” said mademoiselle.
“it was about a spanish girl, whom victor considered that he had some
sort of claim upon. he met robert one day talking to the girl, or
walking with her, or bathing with her, or carrying her basket--i don’t
remember what;--and he became so insulting and abusive that robert gave
him a thrashing on the spot that has kept him comparatively in order for
a good while. it’s about time he was getting another.”

“was her name mariequita?” asked edna.

“mariequita--yes, that was it; mariequita. i had forgotten. oh, she’s a
sly one, and a bad one, that mariequita!”

edna looked down at mademoiselle reisz and wondered how she could have
listened to her venom so long. for some reason she felt depressed,
almost unhappy. she had not intended to go into the water; but she
donned her bathing suit, and left mademoiselle alone, seated under the
shade of the children’s tent. the water was growing cooler as the season
advanced.

ay in the lamplight:

“i love you. good-by--because i love you.”

edna grew faint when she read the words. she went and sat on the sofa.
then she stretched herself out there, never uttering a sound. she did
not sleep. she did not go to bed. the lamp sputtered and went out. she
was still awake in the morning, when celestine unlocked the kitchen door
and came in to light the fire.

victor, with hammer and nails and scraps of scantling, was patching a
corner of one of the galleries. mariequita sat near by, dangling her
legs, watching him work, and handing him nails from the tool-box. the
sun was beating down upon them. the girl had covered her head with her
apron folded into a square pad. they had been talking for an hour or
more. she was never tired of hearing victor describe the dinner at mrs.
pontellier’s. he exaggerated every detail, making it appear a veritable
lucullean feast. the flowers were in tubs, he said. the champagne was
quaffed from huge golden goblets. venus rising

 belief. she
grew sullen and cried a little, threatening to go off and leave him to
his fine ladies. there were a dozen men crazy about her at the cheniere;
and since it was the fashion to be in love with married people, why, she
could run away any time she liked to new orleans with celina’s husband.

celina’s husband was a fool, a coward, and a pig, and to prove it to
her, victor intended to hammer his head into a jelly the next time he
encountered him. this assurance was very consoling to mariequita. she
dried her eyes, and grew cheerful at the prospect.

they were still talking of the dinner and the allurements of city life
when mrs. pontellier herself slipped around the corner of the house. the
two youngsters stayed dumb with amazement before what they considered
to be an apparition. but it was really she in flesh and blood, looking
tired and a little travel-stained.

“i walked up from the wharf,” she said, “and heard the hammering. i
supposed it was you, mending the porch. it’s

everything looks!”

it took victor some little time to comprehend that she had come in
beaudelet’s lugger, that she had come alone, and for no purpose but to
rest.

“there’s nothing fixed up yet, you see. i’ll give you my room; it’s the
only place.”

“any corner will do,” she assured him.

“and if you can stand philomel’s cooking,” he went on, “though i might
try to get her mother while you are here. do you think she would come?”
 turning to mariequita.

mariequita thought that perhaps philomel’s mother might come for a few
days, and money enough.

beholding mrs. pontellier make her appearance, the girl had at once
suspected a lovers’ rendezvous. but victor’s astonishment was so
genuine, and mrs. pontellier’s indifference so apparent, that the
disturbing notion did not lodge long in her brain. she contemplated with
the greatest interest this woman who gave the most sumptuous dinners in
america, and who had all the men in new orleans a

“what time will you have dinner?” asked edna. “i’m very hungry; but
don’t get anything extra.”

“i’ll have it ready in little or no time,” he said, bustling and packing
away his tools. “you may go to my room to brush up and rest yourself.
mariequita will show you.”

“thank you,” said edna. “but, do you know, i have a notion to go down to
the beach and take a good wash and even a little swim, before dinner?”

“the water is too cold!” they both exclaimed. “don’t think of it.”

“well, i might go down and try--dip my toes in. why, it seems to me the
sun is hot enough to have warmed the very depths of the ocean. could you
get me a couple of towels? i’d better go right away, so as to be back in
time. it would be a little

too chilly if i waited till this afternoon.”

mariequita ran over to victor’s room, and returned with some towels,
which she gave to edna.

“i hope you have fish for dinner,” said edna, as she started to walk
away; “but don’t do anything extra if you haven’t.”

“run and find philomel’s mother,” victor instructed the girl. “i’ll
go to the kitchen and see what i can do. by gimminy! women have no
consideration! she might have sent me word.”

edna walked on down to the beach rather mechanically, not noticing
anything special exc
