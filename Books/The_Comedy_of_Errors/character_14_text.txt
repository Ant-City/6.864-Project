_ant. e._ what art thou that keepest me out from the house i owe?

_dro. s._ [_within_] the porter for this time, sir, and
        my name is dromio.

_dro. e._ o villain, thou hast stolen both mine office
        and my name!
the one ne’er got me credit, the other mickle blame.                45
if thou hadst been dromio to-day in my place,
thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name, or thy name
        for an ass.

_luce._ [_within_] what a coil is there, dromio? who are
        those at the gate?

_dro. e._ let my master in, luce.

_luce._                [_within_] faith, no; he comes too late;

_luce._ [_within_] i thought to have ask’d you.

_dro. s._     [_within_] and you said no.                           55

_dro. e._ so, come, help:--well struck! there was blow for blow.

_ant. e._ thou baggage, let me in.

_luce._            [_within_] can you tell for whose sake?

_dro. e._ master, knock the door hard.

_luce._            [_within_] let him knock till it ache.

_ant. e._ you’ll cry for this, minion, if i beat the door down.

_luce._ [_within_] what needs all that, and a pair of stocks
        in the town?                                                60
