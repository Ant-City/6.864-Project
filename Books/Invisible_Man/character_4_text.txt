 was sore, and into my being had
come a profound craving for tranquillity, for peace and quiet, a state i felt i
could never achieve. for one thing, the trumpet was blaring and the rhythm
was too hectic. a tomtom beating like heart-thuds began drowning out the
trumpet, filling my ears. i longed for water and i heard it rushing through
the cold mains my fingers touched as i felt my way, but i couldn't stop to
search because of the footsteps behind me.
"hey, ras," i called. "is it you, destroyer? rinehart?"
no answer, only the rhythmic footsteps behind me. once i tried
crossing the road, but a speeding machine struck me, scraping the skin from
my leg as it roared past.
then somehow i came out of it, ascending hastily from this
underworld of sound to hear louis armstrong innocently asking,
what did i do
to be so black
and blue?
at first i was afraid; this familiar music had demanded action, the
kind of which i was incapable, and yet had i lingered there beneath the
surface i might have attempted

to act. nevertheless, i know now that few
really listen to this music. i sat on the chair's edge in a soaking sweat, as
though each of my 1,369 bulbs had everyone become a klieg light in an
individual setting for a third degree with ras and rinehart in charge. it was
exhausting -- as though i had held my breath continuously for an hour under
the terrifying serenity that comes from days of intense hunger. and yet, it
was a strangely satisfying experience for an invisible man to hear the silence
of sound. i had discovered unrecognized compulsions of my being -- even
though i could not answer "yes" to their promptings. i haven't smoked a
reefer since, however; not because they're illegal, but because to see around
corners is enough (that is n

ave of excitement boiled within me as
i peered out at the sinister light. and now through the hot gusts from the
underground people were emerging and i could feel the trains vibrating the
walk. a cab rolled up to discharge a passenger and i was about to take it
when the woman came up the stairs and stopped before me, smiling. now
what, i thought, seeing her standing there, smiling in her tight-fitting summer
dress; a large young woman who reeked with christmas night perfume who
now came close.
"rinehart, baby, is that you?" she said.
rinehart, i thought. so it works. she had her hand on my arm and
faster than i thought i heard myself answer, "is that you, baby?" and waited
with tense breath.
"well, for once you're on time," she said. "but what you doing
bareheaded, where's your new hat i bought you?"
i wanted to laugh. the scent of christmas night was enfolding me
now and i saw her face draw closer, her eyes widening.
"say, you ain't rinehart, man. what you trying to do? you don't even

ke rine. what's your story?"
i laughed, backing away. "i guess we were both mistaken," i said.
she stepped backward clutching her bag, watching me, confused.
"i really meant no harm," i said. "i'm sorry. who was it you mistook
me for?"
"rinehart, and you'd better not let him catch you pretending to be
him."
"no," i said. "but you seemed so pleased to see him that i couldn't
resist it. he's really a lucky man."
"and i could have sworn you was -- man, you git away from here
before you get me in trouble," she said, moving aside, and i left.
it was very strange. but that about the hat was a good idea, i
thought, hurrying along now and looking out for ras's men. i was wasting
time. at the first hat shop i went in and bought the widest hat i

swagger. this was the real test, if it worked i would go
on to hambro's without further trouble. in the angry period to come i would
be able to move about.
a couple of men approached, eating up the walk with long jaunty
strides that caused their heavy silk sport shirts to flounce rhythmically upon
their bodies. they too wore dark glasses, their hats were set high upon their
heads, the brims turned down. a couple of hipsters, i thought, just as they
spoke.
"what you sayin', daddy-o," they said.
"rinehart, poppa, tell us what you putting down," they said.
oh, hell, they're probably his friends, i thought, waving and moving
on.
"we know what you're doing, rinehart," one of them called. "play it
cool, ole man, play it cool!"
i waved again as though in on the joke. they laughed behind me. i
was nearing the end of the block now, wet with sweat. who was this
rinehart and what was he putting down? i'd have to learn more about him
to avoid further misidentifications . . .
a car passed with its radio bl

"they can fight in the streets, not in here -- hey, y'all," he called
"look over here . . ."
i saw him now, leaning forward with a pistol in his huge fist, resting
it steady upon the bar.
"now put 'em down y'all," he said mournfully. "i done ask you to
put my property down."
brother maceo looked from me to barrelhouse.
"put it down, old man," i said, thinking, why am i acting from pride
when this is not really me?
"you put yourn down," he said.
"both of y'all put 'em down; and you, rinehart," barrelhouse said,
gesturing at me with his pistol, "you get out of my joint and stay out. we
don't need your money in here."
i started to protest, but he held up his palm.
"now you all right with me, rinehart, don't get me wrong. but i just
can't stand trouble," barrelhouse said.
brother maceo had replaced the shaker now and i put my bottle
down and backed to the door.
"and rine," barrelhouse said, "don't go try to pull no pistol neither,
'cause this here one is loaded and i got a permit."

backed to the door, my scalp prickling, watching them both.
"next time don't ask no questions you don't want answered," maceo
called. "an' if you ever want to finish this argument i be right here."
i felt the outside air explode around me and i stood just beyond the
door laughing with the sudden relief of the joke restored, looking back at the
defiant old man in his long-billed cap and the confounded eyes of the crowd.
rinehart, rinehart, i thought, what kind of man is rinehart?
i was still chuckling when, in the next block, i waited for the traffic
lights near a group of men who stood on the corner passing a bottle of
cheap wine between them as they discussed clifton's murder.
"what we need is some guns," one of them said. "an eye for an
eye."
"hell yes, machine guns. pass me the sneakypete, muckleroy."
"wasn't for that sullivan law this here new york wouldn't be
nothing but a shooting gallery," another man said.
"here's the sneakypete, and don't try to find no home 
 
 ___________________________
 
in that bottle."
"it's the only home i got, muckleroy. you want to take that away
from me?"
"man, drink up and pass the damn bottle."
i started around them, hearing one of them say, "what you saying,
mr. rinehart, how's your hammer hanging?"
even up here, i thought, beginning to hurry. "heavy, man," i said,
knowing the answer to that one, "very heavy." they laughed.
"well, it'll be lighter by morning."
"say, look ahere, mr. rinehart, how about giving me a job?" one of
them said, approaching me, and i waved and crossed the street, walking
rapidly down eighth toward the next bus stop.
the shops and groceries were dark now, and children were running
and yelling along the walks, dodging in and out among the adults. i walked,
struck by the merging fluidity of forms seen through the lenses. could this be
the way the world appeared to rinehart? all the dark-glass boys? "for now
we see as through a glass darkly but then -- but the

she was carrying a shopping bag and moved gingerly on her feet.
until she touched my arm i thought that she was talking to herself.
"i say, pardon me, son, look like you trying to pass on by me
tonight. what's the final figger?"
"figure? what figure?"
"now you know what i mean," she said, her voice rising as she put
her hands on her hips and looked forward. "i mean today's last number. ain't
you rine the runner?"
"rine the runner?"
"yas, rinehart the number man. who you trying to fool?"
"but that's not my name, madame," i said, speaking as precisely as i
could and stepping away from her. "you've made a mistake."
her mouth fell wide. "you ain't? well, why you look so much like
him?" she said with hot doubt in her voice. "now, ain't this here something.
let me get on home; if my dream come out, i'm-a have to go look that

"i hope you won," i said, straining to see her clearly, "and i hope he

"thanks, son, but he'll pay off all right. i can see you ain't rinehart
now though. i'm sorry for stopping you."
"it's all right," i said.
"if i'd looked at your shoes i woulda known --"
"why?"
" 'cause rine the runner is known for them knobtoed kind."
i watched her limp away, rocking like the old ship of zion. no
wonder everyone knows him, i thought, in that racket you have to get
around. i was aware of my black-and-white shoes for the first time since the
day of clifton's shooting.
when the squad car veered close to the curb and rolled along slowly

ew what was coming before the cop opened his mouth.
"that you, rinehart, my man?" the cop who was not driving said. he
was white. i could see the shield gleaming on his cap but the number was
vague.
"not this time, officer," i said.
"the hell you say; what're you trying to pull? is this a holdout?"
"you're making a mistake," i said. "i'm not rinehart."
the car stopped, a flashlight beamed in my green-lensed eyes. he
spat into the street. "well, you better be by morning," he said, "and you
better have our cut in the regular place. who the hell you think you are?" he
called as the car speeded up and away.
and before i could turn a crowd of men ran up from the corner

"what were those sonsabitches trying to do to you, daddy?" he said.
"it was nothing, they thought i was someone else."

i looked at them -- were they criminals or simply men who were
worked up over the shooting?
"some guy named rinehart," i said.
"rinehart -- hey, y'all hear that?" snorted the fellow with the gun.
"rinehart! them paddies must be going stone blind. anybody can see you
ain't rinehart."
"but he do look like rine," another man said, staring at me with his
hands in his trousers pockets.
"like hell he does."
"hell, man, rinehart would be driving that cadillac this time of
night. what the hell you talking about?"
"listen, jack," the fellow with the gun said, "don't let nobody make
you act like rinehart. you got to have a smooth tongue, a heartless heart and
be ready to do anything. but if them paddies bother you agin, just let us
know. we aim to stop some of this head-whupping they been doing."
"sure," i said.

east instead of west. i wanted to remove the glasses but decided against it.
ras's men might still be on the prowl.
it was quieter now. no one paid me any special attention, although
the street was alive with pedestrians, all moiling along in the mysterious tint
of green. perhaps i'm out of his territory at last, i thought and began trying
to place rinehart in the scheme of things. he's been around all the while,
but i have been looking in another direction. he was around and others like
him, but i had looked past him until clifton's death (or was it ras?) had
made me aware. what on earth was hiding behind the face of things? if dark
glasses and a white hat could blot out my identity so quickly, who actually
was who?
the perfume was exotic and seemed to roll up the walk behind me
as i became aware of a woman strolling casually behind me.
"i've bee

thought you'd never come. will you be able to see me tonight?"
she had moved close to me now and suddenly i felt a hand fumbling
at my jacket pocket.
"all right, daddy, you don't have to jump evil on me, here it is; now
will you see me?"
i stopped dead, grabbing her hand and looking at her, an exotic girl
even through the green glasses, looking at me with a smile that suddenly
broke. "rinehart, daddy, what's the matter?"
so here it goes again, i thought, holding her tightly.
"i'm not rinehart, miss," i said. "and for the first time tonight i'm
truly sorry."
"but bliss, daddy -- rinehart! you're not trying to put your baby
down -- daddy, what did i do?"
she seized my arm and we were poised face to face in the middle of
the walk. and suddenly she screamed, "oooooooh! you really aren't! and me
trying to give you his money. get away from me, you dumb john. get away
from me!"

drunks stumbled past. i
headed for hambro's, passing a man sitting on the curb with his head bent
over his knees. cars passed. i went on. two solemn-faced children came
passing out handbills which first i refused, then went back and took. after
all, i had to know what was going on in the community. i took the bill and
stepped close to the street light, reading.

rise and fall of an old-fashioned prayer such as i hadn't heard since leaving
the campus; and then only when visiting country preachers were asked to
pray. the voice rose and fell in a rhythmical, dreamlike recital-part
enumeration of earthly trials undergone by the congregation, part rapt display
of vocal virtuosity, part appeal to god. i was still wiping my face and
squinting at crude biblical scenes painted on the windows when two old
ladies came up to me.
"even', rever'n rinehart," one of them said. "how's our dear pastor
this warm evening?"
oh, no, i thought, but perhaps agreeing will cause less trouble than
denying, and i said, "good evening, sisters," muffling my voice with my
handkerchief and catching the odor of the girl's perfume from my hand.
"this here's sister harris, rever'n. she come to join our little band."
"god bless you, sister harris," i said, taking her extended hand.
"you know, rever'n, i once heard you preach years ago. you was just

"er, sister harris," the other sister said, "we better get on in and
find our seats. besides, the pastor's kind of got things to do. though you are
here a little early, aren't you, rever'n?"
"yes," i said, dabbing my mouth with my handkerchief. they were
motherly old women of the southern type and i suddenly felt a nameless
despair. i wanted to tell them that rinehart was a fraud, but now there came
a shout from inside the church and i heard a burst of music.
"just lissen to it, sister harris. that's the new kind of guitar music i
told you rever'n rinehart got for us. ain't it heavenly?"
"praise god," sister harris said. "praise god!"

the whole scene quivered vague and mysterious in the green light,
then the door closed and the sound muted down.
it was too much for me. i removed my glasses and tucked the white
hat carefully beneath my arm and walked away. can it be, i thought, can it
actually be? and i knew that it was. i had heard of it before but i'd never
come so close. still, could he be all of them: rine the runner and rine the
gambler and rine the briber and rine the lover and rinehart the reverend?
could he himself be both rind and heart? what is real anyway? but how
could i doubt it? he was a broad man, a man of parts who got around.
rinehart the rounder. it was true as i was true. his world was possibility

perhaps, i thought, the whole thing should roll off me like drops of
water rolling off jack's glass eye. i should search out the proper political
classification, label rinehart and his situation and quickly forget it. i hurried
away from the church so swiftly that i found myself back at the office before
i remembered that i was going to hambro's.
i was both depressed and fascinated. i wanted to know rinehart and
yet, i thought, i'm upset because i know i don't have to know him, that
simply becoming aware of his existence, being mistaken for him, is enough to
convince me that rinehart is real. it couldn't be, but it is. and it can be, is,
simply because it's unknown. j

how many days could you walk the streets of the big city without
encountering anyone who knew you, and how many nights? you could
actually make yourself anew. the notion was frightening, for now the world
seemed to flow before my eyes. all boundaries down, freedom was not only
the recognition of necessity, it was the recognition of possibility. and sitting
there trembling i caught a brief glimpse of the possibilities posed by
rinehart's multiple personalities and turned away. it was too vast and
confusing to contemplate. then i looked at the polished lenses of the glasses
and laughed. i had been trying simply to turn them into a disguise but they
had become a political instrument instead; for if rinehart could use them in
his work, no doubt i could use them in mine. it was too simple, and yet
they had already opened up a new section of reality for me. what would the
committee say about that? what did their theory tell them o

dy by hambro himself. from
another part of the apartment came a child's voice singing humpty dumpty,
awakening humiliating memories of my first easter program during which i
had stood before the church audience and forgotten the words . . .
"my kid," hambro said, "filibustering against going to bed. a real sea
lawyer, that kid."
the child was singing hickory dickory dock, very fast, as hambro
shut the door. he was saying something about the child and i looked at him
with sudden irritation. with rinehart on my mind, why had i come here?
hambro was so tall that when he crossed his legs both feet touched
the floor. he had been my teacher during my period of indoctrination and
now i realized that i shouldn't have come. hambro's lawyer's mind was too
narrowly logical. he'd see rinehart simply as a criminal, my obsession as a
fall into pure mysticism . . . you'd better hope that is the way he'll see it, i
thought. then i decided to ask him about conditions uptown and leave . . .
"look, brother hambr

ng out of hand. ras's men tried to rough me
up tonight and our strength is steadily going to hell."
"that's regrettable," he said, "but there's nothing to be done about it
that wouldn't upset the larger plan. it's unfortunate, brother, but your
members will have to be sacrificed."
the distant child had stopped singing now, and it was dead quiet. i
looked at the angular composure ot his face searching for the sincerity in his
words. i could feel some deep change. it was as though my discovery of
rinehart had opened a gulf between us over which, though we sat within
touching distance, our voices barely carried and then fell flat, without an
echo. i tried to shake it away, but still the distance, so great that neither
could grasp the emotional tone of the other, remained.
"sacrifice?" my voice said. "you say that very easily."
"just the same, though, all who leave must be considered expendable.
the new directives must be followed rigidly."
it sounded unreal, an antiphonal game. "but why?" i said.
 
 ___________________________
 
 "why
must the directives be changed in my district when the old methods are
needed -- especially now?" somehow i couldn't get the needed urgency into
my words, and beneath it all something about rinehart bothered me, darted
just beneath the surface of my mind; something that had to do with me
intimately.
"it's simple, brother," hambro was saying. "we are making temporary
alliances with other political groups and the interests of one group of brothers
must be sacrificed to that ot the whole."
"why wasn't i told of this?" i said.
"you will be, in time, by the committee -- sacrifice is necessary now
--"
"but shouldn't sacrifice be made willingly by those who know what
they are doing? my people don

they don't even know they're being sacrificed -- at least not by us . . ." but
what, my mind went on, if they're as willing to be duped by the brotherhood
as by rinehart?
i sat up at the thought and there must have been an odd expression
on my face, for hambro, who was resting his elbows upon the arms of his
chair and touching his fingertips together, raised his eyebrows as though
expecting me to continue. then he said, "the disciplined members will
understand."
i pulled tarp's leg chain from my pocket and slipped it over my
knuckles. he didn't notice. "don't you realize that we have only a handful of

have liked him, i thought, he seems to be a really kind and sincere man and
yet he can say this to me . . .
"so you really believe that," i said quietly.
"with all my integrity," he said.
for a second i thought i'd laugh. or let fly with tarp's link.
integrity! he talks to me of integrity! i described a circle in the air. i'd tried
to build my integrity upon the role of brotherhood and now it had changed
to water, air. what was integrity? what did it have to do with a world in
which rinehart was possible and successful?
"but what's changed?" i said. "wasn't i brought in to arouse their
aggressiveness?" my voice fell sad, hopeless.
"for that particular period," hambro said, leaning a little forward.
"only for that period."
"and what will happen now?" i said.
he blew a smoke ring, the blue-gray circle rising up boiling within
its own jetting form, hovering for an instant then disintegrating into a
weaving strand.
"cheer up!" he said. "we shall progress. only now they must be

be more educational."
"and what about the shooting?"
"those who are dissatisfied will drop away and those who remain
you'll teach . . ."
"i don't think i can," i said.
"why? it's just as important."
"because they are against us; besides, i'd feel like rinehart . . ." it
slipped out and he looked at me.
"like who?"
"like a charlatan," i said.
hambro laughed. "i thought you had learned about that, brother."
i looted at him quickly. "learned what?"
"that it's impossible not to take advantage of the people."
"that's rinehartism -- cynicism . . ."
"what?"
"cynicism," i said.
"not cynicism -- realism. the trick is to take advantage of them in
their own best interest."
i sat forward in my chair, suddenly conscious of the unreality of the
conversation. "but

i left in a worse state than that in which i'd come. several buildings
away i heard him call behind me, watched him approach through the dark.
"you left your hat," he said, handing it to me along with the
mimeographed sheets of instructions outlining the new program. i looked at
the hat and at him, thinking of rinehart and invisibility, but knew that for
him it would have no reality. i told him good night and went through the
hot street to central park west, starting toward harlem.

it was simple. but hell, i was both. both sacrificer and victim. i couldn't get
away from that, and hambro didn't have to deal with it. that was reality too,
my reality. he didn't have to put the knife blade to his own throat. what

i walked along the park in the dark. cars passed. from time to time
the sound of voices, squealing laughter, arose from beyond the trees and
hedges. i could smell the sun-singed grass. the sky against which an airplane
beacon played was still overcast. i thought of jack, the people at the funeral,
rinehart. they'd asked us for bread and the best i could give was a glass eye
-- not so much as an electric guitar.
i stopped and dropped to a bench. i should leave, i thought. that
would be the honest thing to do. otherwise i could only tell them to have
hope and try to hold on to those who'd listen. was that also what rinehart
was, a principle of hope for which they gladly paid? otherwise there was
nothing but betrayal, and that meant going back to serve bledsoe, and

either was a self-betrayal. but i couldn't leave; i had to settle with jack and
tobitt. i owed it to clifton and tarp and the others. i had to hold on ... and
then i had an idea that shook me profoundly: you don't have to worry about
the people. if they tolerate rinehart, then they will forget it and even with
them you are invisible. it lasted only the fraction of a second and i rejected
it immediately; still it had flashed across the dark sky of my mind. it was
just like that. it didn't matter because they didn't realize just what had
happened, neither my hope nor my failure. my ambition and integrity were
nothing to them and my failure was as meaningless as clifton's. it had been
that way all along. only in the brotherhood had there seemed a chance for
such a

contradiction. i was and yet i was unseen. it was frightening and as i sat
there i sensed another frightening world of possibilities. for now i saw that i
could agree with jack without agreeing. and i could tell harlem to have hope
when there was no hope. perhaps i could tell them to hope until i found the
basis of something real, some firm ground for action that would lead them
onto the plane of history. but until then i would have to move them without
myself being moved . . . i'd have to do a rinehart.
i leaned against a stone wall along the park, thinking of jack and
hambro and of the day's events and shook with rage. it was all a swindle, an
obscene swindle! they had set themselves up to describe the world. what did
they know of us, except that we numbered so many, worked on certain jobs,
offered so many votes, and provided so many marchers for some protest
parade of theirs! i leaned there, aching to humiliate them, to refute them.
and now all past humiliations became precious parts of my

dues. yes, and i would move about the
community by night and during times of danger by wearing the white hat
and the dark glasses. it was a dreary prospect but a means of destroying
them, at least in harlem. i saw no possibility of organizing a splinter
movement, for what would be the next step? where would we go? there were
no allies with whom we could join as equals; nor were there time or theorists
available to work out an over-all program of our own -- although i felt that
somewhere between rinehart and invisibility there were great potentialities.
but we had no money, no intelligence apparatus, either in government,
business or labor unions; and no communications with our own people except
through unsympathetic newspapers, a few pullman porters who brought
provincial news from distant cities and a group of domestics who reported the
fairly uninteresting private lives of their employers. if only we had some true
friends, some who saw us as more than convenient tools for shaping their

ow could i hold
on? they seemed to have me blocked at every turn, forcing me to fight them
in the dark. finally i tossed the glasses across the bed and dropped into a
fitful nap during which i relived the events of the last few days; except that
instead ot clifton being lost it was myself, and i awoke stale, sweaty and
aware of perfume.
i lay on my stomach, my head resting upon the back of my hand
thinking, where is it coming from? and just as i caught sight ot the glasses i
remembered grasping rinehart's girl's hand. i lay there unmoving, and she
seemed to perch on the bed, a bright-eyed bird with her glossy head and ripe
breasts, and i was in a wood afraid to frighten the bird away. then i was
fully awake and the bird gone and the girl's image in my mind. what would
have happened if i had led her on, how far could i have gone? a desirable
girl like that mixed up with rinehart. and now i sat breathless, asking myself
how rinehart would have solved the problem of information and it came

had felt strong restrictions and resented emma's boldness and her
opinion that i should have been blacker to play my role of harlem leader.
well, there were no restrictions left, the committee had seen to that. she was
fair game and perhaps she'd find me black enough, after all. a committee
meeting was set for tomorrow, and since it was jack's birthday, a party at
the chthonian would follow. thus i would launch my two-pronged attack
under the most favorable circumstance. they were forcing me to rinehart
methods, so bring on the scientists!

i started yessing them the next day and it began beautifully. the
community was still going apart at the seams. crowds formed at the slightest
incidents. store windows were smashed and several clashes erupted during the
morning between bus drivers and their passengers. the papers listed similar
incidents that had exploded during the night. the mirrored fa?de of one store
on 125th street was smashed and i passed to see a group of boys watching

e humid air. i had spent the afternoon
preparing, leaving the office on a pretense of illness to avoid having to attend
the celebration. i had neither itch nor etchings, but there was a vase of
chinese lilies in the living room, and another of american beauty roses on
the table near the bed; and i had put in a supply of wine, whiskey and
liqueur, extra ice cubes, and assortments of fruit, cheese, nuts, candy and
other delicacies from the vendome. in short, i tried to manage things as i
imagined rinehart would have done.
but i bungled it from the beginning. i made the drinks too strong --
which she liked too well; and i brought up politics -- which she all but hated
-- too early in the evening. for all her exposure to ideology she had no
interest in politics and no idea of the schemes that occupied her husband
night and day. she was more interested in the drinks, in which i had to join
her glass for glass, and in little dramas which she had dreamed up around
the figures of joe louis and paul ro

ptibility about her face now that upset
me all the more, for she was neither kidding nor trying to insult me; and i
could not tell if it were horror speaking to me ont of innocence, or innocence
emerging unscathed from the obscene scheme of the evening. i only knew
that the whole affair was a mistake. she had no information and i decided to
get her out of the apartment before i had to deal definitely with either the
horror or the innocence, while i could still deal with it as a joke. what
would rinehart do about this, i thought, and knowing, determined not to let
her provoke me to violence.
"but, sybil, you can see i'm not like that. you make me feel a
tender, protective passion -- look, it's like an oven in here, why don't we get
dressed and go for a walk in central park?"
"but i need it," she said, uncrossing her thighs and sitting up
eagerly. "you can do it, it'll be easy for you, beautiful. threaten to kill me if
i don't give in. you know, talk rough to me, beautiful. a friend of mine said

shaped by her emotion which i could not fulfill,
and i thought, poor sybil, she picked a boy for a man's job and nothing was
as it was supposed to be. even the black bruiser fell down on the job. she'd
lost control of her liquor now and suddenly i bent and kissed her upon the
lips.
"shhh, be quiet," i said, "that's no way to act when you're being --"
and she raised her lips for more and i kissed her again and calmed her and
she dozed off and i decided again to end the farce. such games were for
rinehart, not me. i stumbled out and got a damp towel and began rubbing
out the evidence of my crime. it was as tenacious as sin and it took some
time. water wouldn't do it, whiskey would have smelled and finally i had to
find benzine. fortunately she didn't arouse until i was almost finished.
"d'you do it, boo'ful?" she said.
"yes, of course," i said. "isn't that what you wanted?"
"yes, but i don't seem t'remember . . ."
i looked at her and wanted to laugh. she was trying to see me but
her eyes wouldn'

of an abyssinian chieftain; a fur cap upon his head, his arm bearing a shield,
a cape made of the skin of some wild animal around his shoulders. a figure
more out of a dream than out of harlem, than out of even this harlem
night, yet real, alive, alarming.
"come away from that stupid looting," he called to a group before a
store. "come jine with us to burst in the armory and get guns and
ammunition!"
and hearing his voice i opened my brief case and searched for my
dark glasses, my rineharts, drawing them out only to see the crushed lenses
fall to the street. rinehart, i thought, rinehart! i turned. the police were
back there behind me; if shooting started i'd be caught in the crossfire. i felt
in my brief case, feeling papers, shattered iron, coins, my fingers closing over
tarp's leg chain, and i slipped it over my knuckles, trying to think. i closed
the flap, locking it. a new mood was settling over me as they came on, a
larger crowd than ras had ever drawn. i went calmly forwar

one fraction of a bloody step closer to a definition of who they were and of
what i was and had been. but the definition would have been too narrow; i
was invisible, and hanging would not bring me to visibility, even to their
eyes, since they wanted my death not for myself alone but for the chase i'd
been on all my life; because of the way i'd run, been run, chased, operated,
purged -- although to a great extent i could have done nothing else, given
their blindness (didn't they tolerate both rinehart and bledsoe?) and my
invisibility. and that i, a little black man with an assumed name should die
because a big black man in his hatred and confusion over the nature of a
reality that seemed controlled solely by white men whom i knew to be as
blind as he, was just too much, too outrageously absurd. and i knew that it
was better to live out one's own absurdity than to die for that of others,
whether for ras's or jack's.
so when ras yelled, "hang him!" i let fly the spear and it was as

s and knees, holding tight to
my brief case, i searched the coal until i found the folder of matches the
men had dropped -- how long ago had that been? -- but there were only
three and to save them i started searching for paper to make a torch, feeling
about slowly over the coal pile. i needed just one piece of paper to light my
way out of the hole, but there was nothing. next i searched my pockets,
finding not even a bill, or an advertising folder, or a brotherhood leaflet. why
had i destroyed rinehart's throwaway? well, there was only one thing to do
if i was to make a torch. i'd have to open my brief case. in it were the only
papers i had.
i started with my high-school diploma, applying one precious match
with a feeling of remote irony, even smiling as i saw the swift but feeble
light push back the gloom. i was in a deep basement, full of shapeless
objects that extended farther than i could see, and i realized that to light my
way out i would have to burn every paper in the brief case. i mo

too we had
to say "yes" to the principle, lest they turn upon us to destroy both it and
us?
"agree 'em to death and destruction," grandfather had advised. hell,
weren't they their own death and their own destruction except as the
principle lived in them and in us? and here's the cream of the joke: weren't
we part of them as well as apart from them and subject to die when they
died? i can't figure it out; it escapes me. but what do i really want, i've
asked myself. certainly not the freedom of a rinehart or the power of a jack,
nor simply the freedom not to run. no, but the next step i couldn't make, so
i've remained in the hole.
i'm not blaming anyone for this state of affairs, mind you; nor
merely crying mea culpa. the fact is that you carry part of your sickness
within you, at least i do as an invisible man. i carried my sickness and
though for a long time i tried to place it in the outside world, the attempt to
write it down shows me that at least half of it lay within me. it came upon

 "against" it, i assign myself no rank or any limit, and
such an attitude is very much against the trend of the times. but my world
has become one of infinite possibilities. what a phrase -- still it's a good
phrase and a good view of life, and a man shouldn't accept any other; that
much i've learned underground. until some gang succeeds in putting the
world in a strait jacket, its definition is possibility. step outside the narrow
borders of what men call reality and you step into chaos -- ask rinehart, he's
a master of it -- or imagination. that too i've learned in the cellar, and not
by deadening my sense of perception; i'm invisible, not blind.
no indeed, the world is just as concrete, ornery, vile and sublimely
wonderful as before, only now i better understand my relation to it and it to
me. i've come a long way from those days when, full of illusion, i lived a
public life and attempted to function under the assumption that the world
was solid and all the relationships therein. now i know
