er attention to the most urgent emergency measure, that of getting a fresh horoscope
cast. there was a private, scrambled link from her suite in the palace to madame vesant's studio; the
astrologer's plump, bland features and shrewd eyes came on the screen almost at once. "agnes? what is
it, dear? i have a client with me."

 "your circuit is hushed?"
 "of course."
 "get rid of the client at once. this is an emergency."
 madame alexandra vesant bit her lip, but her expression did not change otherwise and her voice
showed no annoyance. "certainly. just a moment." her features, faded out of the screen, were replaced
by the "hold" signal. a man entered the room, stood waiting by the side of mrs. douglas' desk; she
turned and saw that it was james sanforth, the press agent she had sent for.
 "have you heard from berquist?" she demanded without preamble.
 "eh? i wasn't handling that; that's mccrary's pidgin."
 she brushed the irrelevancy a

inclined to..." she let her voice trail oft
 "please, please! of course i trust you! i wouldn't think of letting anyone else perform a
calculation for me. now listen carefully. no one can hear from your side?"
 "of course not, dear."
 "i want you to cast a horoscope for valentine michael smith."
 "'valentine mich-' the man from mars?"
 "yes, yes. allie, he's been kidnapped. we've got to find him."
 some two hours later madame alexandra vesant pushed herself back from her work table and
sighed. she had had her secretary cancel all appointments and she really had tried; several sheets of
paper, covered with diagrams and figures, and a dog-eared nautical almanac were in front of her and
testified to her efforts. alexandra vesant differed from some other practicing astrologers in that she really

proceed."
 "well, agnes douglas does touch the stuff.., and i know where she gets it. her astrologer can
call mrs. douglas at any time-and, believe you me, mrs. douglas has the ear of the secretary general
whenever she chooses. you can call her astrologer - . . and the rest is up to you."
 "i don't seem to recall any astrologers on my christmas card list," jubal answered dubiously.
"what's his name?"
 "her. and you might try crossing her palm with silver in convincing denominations. her name is
madame alexandra vesant. washington exchange. that's v, e, s, a, n, t."
 "i've got it," jubal said happily. "and, tom, you've done me a world of good!"
 "hope so. anything for the network soon?"
 "hold it." jubal glanced at a note miriam had placed at his elbow some moments ago. it read:
"larry says the transceiver won't trans-and he doesn't know why." jubal went on, "that spot coverage

 "i grok you speak rightly, jubal," jill said slowly, "about its being the best part of the game. but i
wouldn't count on it any time soon. your fullness is not yet. allie cast a horoscope on you just last week."
 "a horoscope? oh, my god! who is 'ailie?' and how dare she cast a horoscope on me! show

 jubal sat up and looked pleased. "becky? is she in this nut house, too? i should have known it.
where is she?"
 "yes, becky. but we call her 'allie' because we've got another becky. but you'll have to wait.
and don't scoff at her horoscopes, jubal; she has the sight."
 "oh, balderdash, stinky. astrology is nonsense and you know it."
 "oh, certainly. even allie knows it. and a percentage of astrologers are clumsy frauds.
