--by heaven, brother toby! you would try the
patience of job;--and i think i have the plagues of one already without
it.--why?--where?--wherein?--wherefore?--upon what account? replied my
uncle toby: in the utmost astonishment.--to think, said my father, of a
man living to your age, brother, and knowing so little about women!--i
know nothing at all about them,--replied my uncle toby: and i think,
continued he, that the shock i received the year after the demolition of
dunkirk, in my affair with widow wadman;--which shock you know i should
not have received, but from my total ignorance of the sex,--has given me
just cause to say, that i neither know nor do pretend to know any thing
about 'em or their concerns either.--methinks, brother, replied my
father, you might, at least, know so much as the right end of a woman
from the wrong.

any thing which is past,--he looketh down upon the ground;--but that

an exact account of the road which
led to it;--or to drop my metaphor (for there is nothing more dishonest
in an historian than the use of one)--in order to conceive the
probability of this error in my uncle toby aright, i must give you some
account of an adventure of trim's, though much against my will, i say
much against my will, only because the story, in one sense, is certainly
out of its place here; for by right it should come in, either amongst
the anecdotes of my uncle toby's amours with widow wadman, in which
corporal trim was no mean actor--or else in the middle of his and my
uncle toby's campaigns on the bowling-green--for it will do very well in
either place;--but then if i reserve it for either of those parts of my
story--i ruin the story i'm upon;--and if i tell it here--i anticipate
matters, and ruin it there.

chapter 2.xvii.

tho' the shock my uncle toby received the year after the demolition of
dunkirk, in his affair with widow wadman, had fixed him in a resolution
never more to think of the sex--or of aught which belonged to it;--yet
corporal trim had made no such bargain with himself. indeed in my
uncle toby's case there was a strange and unaccountable concurrence of
circumstances, which insensibly drew him in, to lay siege to that fair
and strong citadel.--in trim's case there was a concurrence of nothing
in the world, but of him and bridget in the kitchen;--though in truth,
the love and veneration he bore his master was

lute, sweet instrument! of all others the most delicate! the most

chapter 3.lxxix.

now, because i have once or twice said, in my inconsiderate way of
talking, that i was confident the following memoirs of my uncle toby's
courtship of widow wadman, whenever i got time to write them, would
turn out one of the most complete systems, both of the elementary and
practical part of love and love-making, that ever was addressed to
the world--are you to imagine from thence, that i shall set out with
a description of what love is? whether part god and part devil, as
plotinus will have it--

as ten--to determine with ficinus, 'how many parts of it--the one,--and

implication, that love is a thing below a man:--this is recurring again
to plato's opinion, which, with all his divinityship,--i hold to be
damnable and heretical:--and so much for that.

let love therefore be what it will,--my uncle toby fell into it.

--and possibly, gentle reader, with such a temptation--so wouldst thou:
for never did thy eyes behold, or thy concupiscence covet any thing in
this world, more concupiscible than widow wadman.

i wish my uncle toby had been a water-drinker; for then the thing had
been accounted for, that the first moment widow wadman saw him, she felt
something stirring within her in his favour--something!--something.

--something perhaps more than friendship--less than love--something--no
matter what--no matter where--i would not give a single hair off my
mule's tail, and be obliged to pluck it off myself (indeed the villain
has not many to spare, and is not a little vicious into the bargain), to
be let by your worships into the secret--

unfurnished; and the little inn where poor le fever died, not yet built;
my uncle toby was constrained to accept of a bed at mrs. wadman's, for
a night or two, till corporal trim (who to the character of an excellent
valet, groom, cook, sempster, surgeon, and engineer, super-added that of
an excellent upholsterer too), with the help of a carpenter and a couple
of taylors, constructed one in my uncle toby's house.

in her warm bed--or playing with a case-knife--or any thing you
please--than make a man the object of her attention, when the house and
all the furniture is her own.

there is nothing in it out of doors and in broad day-light, where a
woman has a power, physically speaking, of viewing a man in more lights
than one--but here, for her soul, she can see him in no light with

i do not speak it with regard to the coarseness or cleanness of them--or
the strength of their gussets--but pray do not night-shifts differ
from day-shifts as much in this particular, as in any thing else in the
world; that they so far exceed the others in length, that when you
are laid down in them, they fall almost as much below the feet, as the
day-shifts fall short of them?

widow wadman's night-shifts (as was the mode i suppose in king william's
and queen anne's reigns) were cut however after this fashion; and if the
fashion is changed (for in italy they are come to nothing)--so much the
worse for the public; they were two flemish ells and a half in length,
so that allowing a moderate woman two ells, she had half an ell to
spare, to do what she would with.

most natural kick that could be kick'd in her situation--for
supposing......... to be the sun in its meridian, it was a north-east
kick--she kick'd the pin out of her fingers--the etiquette which hung
upon it, down--down it fell to the ground, and was shiver'd into a
thousand atoms.

from all which it was plain that widow wadman was in love with my uncle
toby.



chapter 4.xxxiv.

my uncle toby's head at that time was full of other matters, so that it
was not till the demolition of dunkirk, when all the other civilities of
europe were settled, that he found leisure to return this.

this made an armistice (that is, speaking with regard to my uncle
toby--but with respect to mrs. wadman, a vacancy)--of almost eleven
years. but in all cases of this nature, as it is the second blow, happen

this is not a distinction without a difference.

it is not like the affair of an old hat cock'd--and a cock'd old
hat, about which your reverences have so often been at odds with one
another--but there is a difference here in the nature of things--

and let me tell you, gentry, a wide one too.



chapter 4.xxxv.

now as widow wadman did love my uncle toby--and my uncle toby did not
love widow wadman, there was nothing for widow wadman to do, but to go
on and love my uncle toby--or let it alone.

widow wadman would do neither the one or the other.

--though by the bye the r should have gone first--but in short 'tis of
such a nature, as my father once told my uncle toby upon the close of a
long dissertation upon the subject--'you can scarce,' said he, 'combine
two ideas together upon it, brother toby, without an hypallage'--what's
that? cried my uncle toby.

--and what is he to do there? cried my uncle toby.

nothing, quoth my father, but to get in--or let it alone.

now widow wadman, as i told you before, would do neither the one or the
other.

she stood however ready harnessed and caparisoned at all points, to
watch accidents.



chapter 4.xxxviii.

the fates, who certainly all fore-knew of these amours of widow wadman
and my uncle toby, had, from the first creation of matter and motion
(and with more courtesy than they usually do things of this kind),
established such a chain of causes and effects hanging so fast to one
another, that it was scarce possible for my uncle t

the difficulty was to get my uncle toby, to look at one at all.

'tis surmounted. and

i see him yonder with his pipe pendulous in his hand, and the ashes
falling out of it--looking--and looking--then rubbing his eyes--and
looking again, with twice the good-nature that ever galileo look'd for a
spot in the sun.

--in vain! for by all the powers which animate the organ--widow wadman's
left eye shines this moment as lucid as her right--there is neither
mote, or sand, or dust, or chaff, or speck, or particle of opake matter
floating in it--there is nothing, my dear paternal uncle! but one
lambent delicious fire, furtively shooting out from every part of it, in
all directions, into thine--

--if thou lookest, uncle toby, in search of this mote one moment
longer,--thou art undone.

was presently convinced, that his wound was not a skin-deep wound--but
that it had gone to his heart.



chapter 4.li.

the world is ashamed of being virtuous--my uncle toby knew little of the
world; and therefore when he felt he was in love with widow wadman, he
had no conception that the thing was any more to be made a mystery of,
than if mrs. wadman had given him a cut with a gap'd knife across his
finger: had it been otherwise--yet as he ever look'd upon trim as a
humble friend; and saw fresh reasons every day of his life, to treat
him as such--it would have made no variation in the manner in which he
informed him of the affair.

'i am in love, corporal!' quoth my uncle toby.

mrs. wadman had told it, with all its circumstances, to mrs. bridget
twenty-four hours before; and was at that very moment sitting in council
with her, touching some slight misgivings with regard to the issue of
the affairs, which the devil, who never lies dead in a ditch, had put
into her head--before he would allow half time, to get quietly through
her te deum.

i am terribly afraid, said widow wadman, in case i should marry him,
bridget--that the poor captain will not enjoy his health, with the
monstrous wound upon his groin--

it may not, madam, be so very large, replied bridget, as you think--and
i believe, besides, added she--that 'tis dried up--

found they had been turn'd before--then turn them again, brother, said
my father, rapidly, for there will be many a turning of 'em yet
before all's done in the affair--they are as rotten as dirt, said
the corporal--then by all means, said my father, bespeak a new pair,
brother--for though i know, continued my father, turning himself to the
company, that widow wadman has been deeply in love with my brother toby
for many years, and has used every art and circumvention of woman to
outwit him into the same passion, yet now that she has caught him--her
fever will be pass'd its height--

--she has gained her point.

in this case, continued my father, which plato, i am persuaded, never
thought of--love, you see, is not so much a sentiment as a situation,
into which a man enters, as my brother toby would do, into a corps--no
matter whether he loves the service or

considerable--i would lay, an' please your honour, my montero-cap to a

before your honours--

--there is nothing improper in it, said my father--'tis a mode of
expression; for in saying thou would'st lay thy montero-cap to a
shilling--all thou meanest is this--that thou believest--

--now, what do'st thou believe?

that widow wadman, an' please your worship, cannot hold it out ten
days--

and whence, cried slop, jeeringly, hast thou all this knowledge of
woman, friend?

'twas a beguine, said my uncle toby.

doctor slop was too much in wrath to listen to the distinction; and my
father taking that very crisis to fall in helter-skelter upon the whole
order of nuns and beguines, a set of silly, fusty, baggages--slop could
not stand it--and my uncle toby having some mea
