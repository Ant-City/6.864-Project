[CHARACTER] - 
                	[CHARACTER],
the blind soothsayer of thebes, appears in both oedipus
the king and antigone. in oedipus
the king, [CHARACTER] tells oedipus that he is the murderer
he hunts, and oedipus does not believe him. in antigone, [CHARACTER]
tells creon that creon himself is bringing disaster upon thebes,
and creon does not believe him. yet, both oedipus and creon claim
to trust [CHARACTER] deeply. the literal blindness of the soothsayer
points to the metaphorical blindness of those who refuse to believe
the truth about themselves when they hear it spoken.
