dr.[CHARACTER] - 
      the hospital psychiatrist. dr.[CHARACTER] is responsible for dealing with the lisbon cases. after extensively testing cecilia, he concludes that her first suicide attempt was a cry for help, and suggests she be given more social outlets. upon her death and the family's subsequent disintegration, he begins to revise his hypothesis, diagnosing the surviving sisters with post-traumatic stress syndrome and warning of the high incidence of repetitive suicide in individual families. dr.[CHARACTER] is a respected local authority. the community, who seeks a scientific or medical rationalization for the tragedy, eagerly receive all of his diagnoses of the girls. although his diagnoses and recommendations seem relevant and humane, if somewhat benign, they cannot stand up to mrs. lisbon's opinion nor be implemented without her consent, and thus are of little actual use to the girls.
