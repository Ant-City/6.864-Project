[CHARACTER] - 
                 a
beautiful, nineteen-year-old bullfighter. romero's talents in the
ring charm both aficionados and newcomers to the sport alike. he
serves as a foil (a character whose attitudes or emotions contrast
with, and thereby accentuate, those of another character) for jake
and his friends in that he carries himself with dignity and confidence
at all times. moreover, his passion for bullfighting gives his life
meaning and purpose. in a world of amorality and corrupted masculinity,
romero remains a figure of honesty, purity, and strength.
