     volt: mosca!--

     mos: when will you have your inventory brought, sir?
     or see a coppy of the will?--anon!--

     this makes me young again, a score of years.

     corv: 'las, good gentleman!

     mos: tut! forget, sir.
     the weeping of an heir should still be laughter
     under a visor.
