sir[CHARACTER] 
though[CHARACTER] and guinevere share the high table at the
new year's celebration in arthur's court, he describes himself as
the least of arthur's knights in terms of both physical prowess
and mental ability. his modest claim to inferiority and his high
status at court--he is arthur's nephew and one of camelot's most
famous knights--testify to both his humility and his ambition.[CHARACTER]
seeks to improve his inner self throughout the poem. after[CHARACTER]
arrives at bertilak's castle in part 2, it
is evident that his reputation is quite widespread. to[CHARACTER], his
public reputation is as important as his own opinion of himself,
and he therefore insists on wearing the green girdle as a sign of
shame at the story's end. he believes that sins should be as visible
as virtues.

	even though the green knight essentially tricks[CHARACTER]
by not telling him about his supernatural abilities before asking
gawain to agree to his terms,[CHARACTER] refuses to back out of their
deal. he stands by his commitments absolutely, even when it means
jeopardizing his own life. the poem frequently reiterates[CHARACTER]'s
deep fears and anxieties, but[CHARACTER]'s desire to maintain his personal integrity
at all costs enables him to conquer his fears in his quest for the
green knight.
	gawain is a paragon of virtue in parts 1 and 2 of
the poem. but in part 3 he conceals from
his host the magical green girdle that the host's wife gives him,
revealing that, despite his bravery,[CHARACTER] values his own life
more than his honesty. ultimately, however,[CHARACTER] confesses his
sin to the knight and begs to be pardoned; thereafter, he voluntarily
wears the girdle as a symbol of his sin. because[CHARACTER] repents
of his sin in such an honorable manner, his one indiscretion in
the poem actually ends up being an example of his basic goodness.
	gawain is not a static character. in his encounter with
the green knight, he recognizes the problematic nature of courtly
ideals. when he returns to arthur's court at camelot, the other
lords and ladies still look to him like lighthearted children, but
gawain is weighed down by a new somberness. though he survives his
quest,[CHARACTER] emerges at the end of the poem as a humbled man who
realizes his own faults and has to live with the fact that he will
never live up to his own high standards.
