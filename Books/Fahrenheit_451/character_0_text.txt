awe. 

he felt she was walking in a circle about him, turning him end for end, shaking him quietly, and 

emptying his pockets, without once moving herself. 

"kerosene," he said, because the silence had lengthened, "is nothing but perfume to me." 

"does it seem like that, really?" 

"of course. why not?" 

she gave herself time to think of it. "i don't know." she turned to face the sidewalk going toward 

their homes. "do you mind if i walk back with you? i'm clarisse mcclellan." 

"clarisse. guy montag. come along. what are you doing out so late wandering around? how 

old are you?" 

they walked in the warm-cool blowing night on the silvered pavement and there was the faintest 

breath of fresh apricots and strawberries in the air, and he looked around and realized this was 

quite impossible, so late in the year. 

there was only the girl walking with him now, her face bright as snow in the moonlight, and he 

knew she was working his questions around, seeking the best answers she could pos

think of our investment. why should i read? what for?" 

"what for! why!" said montag. "i saw the damnedest snake in the world the other night. it was 

dead but it was alive. it could see but it couldn't see. you want to see that snake. it's at 

emergency hospital where they filed a report on all the junk the snake got out of you! would 

you like to go and check their file? maybe you'd look under guy montag or maybe under fear or 

war. would you like to go to that house that burnt last night? and rake ashes for the bones of the 

woman who set fire to her own house! what about clarisse mcclellan, where do we look for 

her? the morgue! listen!" 

the bombers crossed the sky and crossed the sky over the house, gasping, murmuring, whistling 

like an immense, invisible fan, circling in emptiness. 

"jesus god," said montag. "every hour so many damn things in the sky! how in hell did those 

bombers

but a frame skeleton strung with asphalt tendons. 

you must remember, burn them or they'll burn you, he thought. right now it's as simple as that. 

he searched his pockets, the money was there, and in his other pocket he found the usual 

seashell upon which the city was talking to itself in the cold black morning. 

"police alert. wanted: fugitive in city. has committed murder and crimes against the state. 

name: guy montag. occupation: fireman. last seen ..."

thoroughfare ten lanes wide. it seemed like a boatless river frozen there in the raw light of the 

high white arc-lamps; you could drown trying to cross it, he felt; it was too wide, it was too open. 

it was a vast stage without scenery, inviting him to run across, easily seen in the blazing 

illumination, easily caught, easily shot down.

"i'd better run." 
"let's check." 

he took montag quickly into the bedroom and lifted a picture frame aside, revealing a television 
screen the size of a postal card. "i always wanted something very small, something i could talk 
to, something i could blot out with the palm of my hand, if necessary, nothing that could shout 
me down, nothing monstrous big. so, you see." he snapped it on. "montag," the tv set said, and 
lit up. "m-o-n-t-a-g." the name was spelled out by the voice. "guy montag. still running. 
police helicopters are up. a new mechanical hound has been brought from another district.. ." 
montag and faber looked at each other. 

"... mechanical hound never fails. never since its first use in tracking quarry has this incredible 
invention made a mistake. tonight, this network is proud to have the opportunity to follow the 
hound by camera helicopter as it starts on its way to the target..." 
faber poured two glasses of whisky. "we'll need these." 
they drank.
