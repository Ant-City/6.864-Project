then she remembered what she had been waiting for.




a little cloud

eight years before he had seen his friend off at the north wall and wished him godspeed. gallaher had got on. you could tell that at once by his travelled air, his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. few fellows had talents like his and fewer still could remain unspoiled by such success. gallaherâ€™s heart was in the right place and he had deserved to win. it was something to have a friend like that.
little chandlerâ€™s thoughts ever since lunch-time had been of his meeting with gallaher, of gallaherâ€™s invitation and of the great city london where gallaher lived. he was called little chandler because, though he was but slightly under the average stature, he gave one the idea of being a little man. his hands were white and small, his frame was fragile, his voice was quiet and his manners were refined. he took the greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and used perfume discreetly on his handke

when his hour had struck he stood up and took leave of his desk and of his fellow-clerks punctiliously. he emerged from under the feudal arch of the kingâ€™s inns, a neat modest figure, and walked swiftly down henrietta street. the golden sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp. a horde of grimy children populated the street. they stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon the thresholds. little chandler gave them no thought. he picked his way deftly through all that minute vermin-like life and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions in which the old nobility of dublin had roystered. no memory of the past touched him, for his mind was full of a present joy.
he had never been in corlessâ€™s but he knew the value of the name. he knew that people went there after the theatre to eat oysters and drink liqueurs; and he had heard that the waiters there spoke french and german. walking swiftly

xcitedly. sometimes, however, he courted the causes of his fear. he chose the darkest and narrowest streets and, as he walked boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his footsteps troubled him, the wandering silent figures troubled him; and at times a sound of low fugitive laughter made him tremble like a leaf.
he turned to the right towards capel street. ignatius gallaher on the london press! who would have thought it possible eight years before? still, now that he reviewed the past, little chandler could remember many signs of future greatness in his friend. people used to say that ignatius gallaher was wild. of course, he did mix with a rakish set of fellows at that time, drank freely and borrowed money on all sides. in the end he had got mixed up in some shady affair, some money transaction: at least, that was one version of his flight. but nobody denied him talent. there was always a certain ... something in ignatius gallaher that impressed you in spite of yourself. even when he was ou

t at elbows and at his witsâ€™ end for money he kept up a bold face. little chandler remembered (and the remembrance brought a slight flush of pride to his cheek) one of ignatius gallaherâ€™s sayings when he was in a tight corner:
â€œhalf time now, boys,â€ he used to say light-heartedly. â€œwhereâ€™s my considering cap?â€
that was ignatius gallaher all out; and, damn it, you couldnâ€™t but admire him for it.
little chandler quickened his pace. for the first time in his life he felt himself superior to the people he passed. for the first time his soul revolted against the dull inelegance of capel street. there was no doubt about it: if you wanted to succeed you had to go away. you could do nothing in dublin. as he crossed grattan bridge he looked down the river towards the lower quays and pitied the poor stunted houses. they seemed to him a band of tramps, huddled together along the riverbanks, their old coats cove

ns of aging in meâ€”eh, what? a little grey and thin on the topâ€”what?â€
ignatius gallaher took off his hat and displayed a large closely cropped head. his face was heavy, pale and clean-shaven. his eyes, which were of bluish slate-colour, relieved his unhealthy pallor and shone out plainly above the vivid orange tie he wore. between these rival features the lips appeared very long and shapeless and colourless. he bent his head and felt with two sympathetic fingers the thin hair at the crown. little chandler shook his head as a denial. ignatius galaher put on his hat again.
â€œit pulls you down,â€ he said. â€œpress life. always hurry and scurry, looking for copy and sometimes not finding it: and then, always to have something new in your stuff. damn proofs and printers, i say, for a few days. iâ€™m deuced glad, i can tell you, to get back to the old country. does a fellow good, a bit of a holiday. i feel a ton better since i landed again in dear dirty dublin.... here you are, tommy. water? say whe

little chandler allowed his whisky to be very much diluted.
â€œyou donâ€™t know whatâ€™s good for you, my boy,â€ said ignatius gallaher. â€œi drink mine neat.â€
â€œi drink very little as a rule,â€ said little chandler modestly. â€œan odd half-one or so when i meet any of the old crowd: thatâ€™s all.â€
â€œah, well,â€ said ignatius gallaher, cheerfully, â€œhereâ€™s to us and to old times and old acquaintance.â€
they clinked glasses and drank the toast.
â€œi met some of the old gang today,â€ said ignatius gallaher. â€œoâ€™hara seems to be in a bad way. whatâ€™s he doing?â€
â€œnothing,â€ said little chandler. â€œheâ€™s gone to the dogs.â€
â€œbut hogan has a good sit, hasnâ€™t he?â€
â€œyes; heâ€™s in the

â€œother things, too,â€ said little chandler shortly.
ignatius gallaher laughed.
â€œtommy,â€ he said, â€œi see you havenâ€™t changed an atom. youâ€™re the very same serious person that used to lecture me on sunday mornings when i had a sore head and a fur on my tongue. youâ€™d want to knock about a bit in the world. have you never been anywhere even for a trip?â€
â€œiâ€™ve been to the isle of man,â€ said little chandler.
ignatius gallaher laughed.
â€œthe isle of man!â€ he said. â€œgo to london or paris: paris, for choice. thatâ€™d do

â€œhave you seen paris?â€
â€œi should think i have! iâ€™ve knocked about there a little.â€
â€œand is it really so beautiful as they say?â€ asked little chandler.
he sipped a little of his drink while ignatius gallaher finished his boldly.
â€œbeautiful?â€ said ignatius gallaher, pausing on the word and on the flavour of his drink. â€œitâ€™s not so beautiful, you know. of course, it is beautiful.... but itâ€™s the life of paris; thatâ€™s the thing. ah, thereâ€™s no city like paris for gaiety, movement, excitement....â€
little chandler finished his whisky and, after some trouble, succeeded in catching the barmanâ€™s eye. he ordered the same again.

little chandler said nothing until the barman returned with two glasses: then he touched his friendâ€™s glass lightly and reciprocated the former toast. he was beginning to feel somewhat disillusioned. gallaherâ€™s accent and way of expressing himself did not please him. there was something vulgar in his friend which he had not observed before. but perhaps it was only the result of living in london amid the bustle and competition of the press. the old personal charm was still there under this new gaudy manner.

 and, after all, gallaher had lived, he had seen the world. little chandler looked at his friend enviously.
â€œeverything in paris is gay,â€ said ignatius gallaher. â€œthey believe in enjoying lifeâ€”and donâ€™t you think theyâ€™re right? if you want to enjoy yourself properly you must go to paris. and, mind you, theyâ€™ve a great feeling for the irish there. when they heard i was from ireland they were ready to eat me, man.â€
little chandler took four or five sips from his glass.
â€œtell me,â€ he said, â€œis it true that paris is so ... immoral as they say?â€
ignatius gallaher made a catholic gesture with his right arm.
â€œevery place is immoral,â€ he said. â€œof course you do find spicy bits in paris. go to one of the studentsâ€™ balls, for instance. thatâ€™s lively, if you like, when the cocottes begin to let themselves loose. you know what they are, i suppose?â€
â€œiâ€™ve heard of them,â€ said little chandler.

â€œah,â€ he said, â€œyou may say what you like. thereâ€™s no woman like the parisienneâ€”for style, for go.â€
â€œthen it is an immoral city,â€ said little chandler, with timid insistenceâ€”â€œi mean, compared with london or dublin?â€
â€œlondon!â€ said ignatius gallaher. â€œitâ€™s six of one and half-a-dozen of the other. you ask hogan, my boy. i showed him a bit about london when he was over there. heâ€™d open your eye.... i say, tommy, donâ€™t make punch of that whisky: liquor up.â€
â€œno, really....â€
â€œo, come on, another one wonâ€™t do you any harm. what is it? the same again, i suppose?â€
â€œwell ... all right.â€

 was rife abroad. he summarised the vices of many capitals and seemed inclined to award the palm to berlin. some things he could not vouch for (his friends had told him), but of others he had had personal experience. he spared neither rank nor caste. he revealed many of the secrets of religious houses on the continent and described some of the practices which were fashionable in high society and ended by telling, with details, a story about an english duchessâ€”a story which he knew to be true. little chandler was astonished.
â€œah, well,â€ said ignatius gallaher, â€œhere we are in old jog-along dublin where nothing is known of such things.â€
â€œhow dull you must find it,â€ said little chandler, â€œafter all the other places youâ€™ve seen!â€
â€œwell,â€ said ignatius gallaher, â€œitâ€™s a relaxation to come over here, you know. and, after all, itâ€™s the old country, as they say, isnâ€™t it? you canâ€™t help having a certain feeling for it. thatâ€™s human nature.... but tell me something about yo

urself. hogan told me you had ... tasted the joys of connubial bliss. two years ago, wasnâ€™t it?â€
little chandler blushed and smiled.
â€œyes,â€ he said. â€œi was married last may twelve months.â€
â€œi hope itâ€™s not too late in the day to offer my best wishes,â€ said ignatius gallaher. â€œi didnâ€™t know your address or iâ€™d have done so at the time.â€
he extended his hand, which little chandler took.
â€œwell, tommy,â€ he said, â€œi wish you and yours every joy in life, old chap, and tons of money, and may you never die till i shoot you. and thatâ€™s the wish of a sincere friend, an old friend. you know that?â€
â€œi know that,â€ said little chandler.
â€œany youngsters?â€ said ignatius gallaher.
little chandler blushed again.
â€œwe have one child,â€ he said.
â€œson or daughter?â€
â€œa little boy.â€
ignatius gallaher slapped his friend sonorously on the back.
â€œbravo,â€ he said,

 â€œi wouldnâ€™t doubt you, tommy.â€
little chandler smiled, looked confusedly at his glass and bit his lower lip with three childishly white front teeth.
â€œi hope youâ€™ll spend an evening with us,â€ he said, â€œbefore you go back. my wife will be delighted to meet you. we can have a little music andâ€”â€”â€
â€œthanks awfully, old chap,â€ said ignatius gallaher, â€œiâ€™m sorry we didnâ€™t meet earlier. but i must leave tomorrow night.â€
â€œtonight, perhaps...?â€
â€œiâ€™m awfully sorry, old man. you see iâ€™m over here with another fellow,

clever young chap he is too, and we arranged to go to a little card-party. only for that....â€
â€œo, in that case....â€
â€œbut who knows?â€ said ignatius gallaher considerately. â€œnext year i may take a little skip over here now that iâ€™ve broken the ice. itâ€™s only a pleasure deferred.â€
â€œvery well,â€ said little chandler, â€œthe next time you come we must have an evening together. thatâ€™s agreed now, isnâ€™t it?â€
â€œyes, thatâ€™s agreed,â€ said ignatius gallaher. â€œnext year if i come, parole dâ€™honneur.â€
â€œand to clinch the bargain,â€ said little chandler, â€œweâ€™ll just have one more now.â€
ignatius gallaher took out a large gold watch and looked at it.
â€œis it to be the last?â€ he said. â€œbecause you know, i have an a.p.â€
â€œo, yes, positively,â€ said little chandler.
â€œvery well, then,â€

 said ignatius gallaher, â€œlet us have another one as a deoc an doruisâ€”thatâ€™s good vernacular for a small whisky, i believe.â€
little chandler ordered the drinks. the blush which had risen to his face a few moments before was establishing itself. a trifle made him blush at any time: and now he felt warm and excited. three small whiskies had gone to his head and gallaherâ€™s strong cigar had confused his mind, for he was a delicate and abstinent person. the adventure of meeting gallaher after eight years, of finding himself with gallaher in corlessâ€™s surrounded by lights and noise, of listening to gallaherâ€™s stories and of sharing

and education. he was sure that he could do something better than his friend had ever done, or could ever do, something higher than mere tawdry journalism if he only got the chance. what was it that stood in his way? his unfortunate timidity! he wished to vindicate himself in some way, to assert his manhood. he saw behind gallaherâ€™s refusal of his invitation. gallaher was only patronising him by his friendliness just as he was patronising ireland by his visit.
the barman brought their drinks. little chandler pushed one glass towards his friend and took up the other boldly.
â€œwho knows?â€ he said, as they lifted their glasses. â€œwhen you come next year i may have the pleasure of wishing long life and happiness to mr and mrs ignatius gallaher.â€
ignatius gallaher in the act of drinking closed one eye expressively over the rim of his glass. when he had drunk he smacked his lips decisively, set down his glass and said:
â€œno blooming fear of that, my boy. iâ€™m going to have my fling first and see

a bit of life and the world before i put my head in the sackâ€”if i ever do.â€
â€œsome day you will,â€ said little chandler calmly.
ignatius gallaher turned his orange tie and slate-blue eyes full upon his friend.
â€œyou think so?â€ he said.
â€œyouâ€™ll put your head in the sack,â€ repeated little chandler stoutly, â€œlike everyone else if you can find the girl.â€
he had slightly emphasised his tone and he was aware that he had betrayed himself; but, though the colour had heightened in his cheek, he did not flinch from his friendâ€™s gaze. ignatius gallaher watched him for a few moments and then said:
â€œif ever it occurs, you may bet your bottom dollar thereâ€™ll be no mooning and spooning about it. i mean to marry money. sheâ€™ll have a good fat account at the bank or she wonâ€™t do for me.â€

little chandler shook his head.
â€œwhy, man alive,â€ said ignatius gallaher, vehemently, â€œdo you know what it is? iâ€™ve only to say the word and tomorrow i can have the woman and the cash. you donâ€™t believe it? well, i know it. there are hundredsâ€”what am i saying?â€”thousands of rich germans and jews, rotten with money, thatâ€™d only be too glad.... you wait a while my boy. see if i donâ€™t play my cards properly. when i go about a thing i mean business, i tell you. you just wait.â€

s to his mouth, finished his drink and laughed loudly. then he looked thoughtfully before him and said in a calmer tone:
â€œbut iâ€™m in no hurry. they can wait. i donâ€™t fancy tying myself up to one woman, you know.â€
he imitated with his mouth the act of tasting and made a wry face.
â€œmust get a bit stale, i should think,â€ he said.


little chandler sat in the room off the hall, holding a child in his arms. to save money they kept no servant but annieâ€™s young sister monica came for an hour or so in the morning and an hour or so in the evening to help. but monica had gone home long ago. it was a quarter to nine. little chandler had come home late for tea and, moreover, he had forgotten to bring annie home the parcel of coffee from bewleyâ€™s. of course she was in a bad humour and gave him short answers. she said she would do without any t

ea but when it came near the time at which the shop at the corner closed she decided to go out herself for a quarter of a pound of tea and two pounds of sugar. she put the sleeping child deftly in his arms and said:
â€œhere. donâ€™t waken him.â€
a little lamp with a white china shade stood upon the table and its light fell over a photograph which was enclosed in a frame of crumpled horn. it was annieâ€™s photograph. little chandler looked at it, pausing at the thin tight lips. she wore the pale blue summer blouse which he had brought her home as a present one saturday. it had cost him ten and elevenpence; but what an agony of nervousness it had cost him! how he had suffered that day, waiting at the shop door until the shop was empty, standing at the counter and trying to appear at his ease while the girl piled ladiesâ€™ blouses before him, paying at the desk and forgetting to take up the odd penny of his change, being cal

the door was burst open and a young woman ran in, panting.
â€œwhat is it? what is it?â€ she cried.
the child, hearing its motherâ€™s voice, broke out into a paroxysm of sobbing.
â€œitâ€™s nothing, annie ... itâ€™s nothing.... he began to cry....â€
she flung her parcels on the floor and snatched the child from him.
â€œwhat have you done to him?â€ she cried, glaring into his face.
little chandler sustained for one moment the gaze of her eyes and his heart closed together as he met the hatred in them. he began to stammer:
â€œitâ€™s nothing.... he ... he began to cry.... i couldnâ€™t ... i didnâ€™t do anything.... what?â€
giving no heed to him she began to walk up and down the room, clasping the child tightly in her arms and murmuring:
â€œmy little man! my little mannie! was â€˜ou frightened, love?... there now, love! there now!... lambabaun! mammaâ€™s little lamb of the world!... there

little chandler felt his cheeks suffused with shame and he stood back out of the lamplight. he listened while the paroxysm of the childâ€™s sobbing grew less and less; and tears of remorse started to his eyes.
