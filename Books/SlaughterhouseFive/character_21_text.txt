latteringly. bright
sunlight came crashing in. there were thousands of parked automobiles out there,
twinkling on a vast lake of blacktop. billy's office was part of a suburban shopping
center.
 right outside the window was billy's own cadillac el dorado coupe de ville. he read
the stickers on the bumper. 'visit ausable chasm,' said one. 'support your police
department,' said another. there was a third. 'impeach earl warren' it said. the stickers
about the police and earl warren were gifts from billy's father-in-law, a member of the
john birch society. the date on the license plate was 1967, which would make billy
pilgrim forty-four years old. he asked himself this: 'where have all the years gone?'
 billy turned his attention to his desk. there was an open copy of the review of
optometry there. it was opened to an editorial, which billy now read, his lips moving
slightly.
what happens in 1968 will rule the fare of european optometrists for at least 50
years! billy read. with this warning, jean thiri

 moments after that, the saucer entered a time warp, and billy was flung back into his
childhood. he was twelve years old, quaking as he stood with his mother and father on
bright angel point, at the rim of grand canyon. the little human family was staring at
the floor of the canyon, one mile straight down.
 'well,' said billy's father, manfully kicking a pebble into space, 'there it is.' they had
come to this famous place by automobile. they had had several blowouts on the way.
 'it was worth the trip,' said billy's mother raptly. 'oh, god was it ever worth it.'
 billy hated the canyon. he was sure that he was going to fall in. his mother touched
him, and he wet his pants.
 there were other tourists looking down into the canyon, too, and a ranger was there to
answer questions. a frenchman who had come all the way from france

good to see you, mom. how have you been?"'
 'today could be the day.'
 'every night i pray.'
 'that's a good thing to do.'
 'people would be surprised if they knew how much in this world was due to prayers.'
 'you never said a truer word, dear.'
 'does your mother come to see you often?'
 'my mother is dead,' said rosewater. so it goes.
 'i'm sorry.'
 'at least she had a happy life as long as it lasted.'
 'that's a consolation, anyway.'
 'yes.'
 'billy's father is dead, you know, said billy's mother. so it goes.
 'a boy needs a father.'
 and on and on it went--that duet between the dumb, praying lady and the big, hollow
man so full of loving echoes.
 'he was at the top of his class when this happened,' said billy's mother.
 'maybe he was working too hard.' said rosewater. he held a book he wanted to read,
but he was much too polite to read and talk, too, easy as it was to give billy's mother
satisfactory answers. the book was maniacs in the fourth dim

ere optometrists, too. they called themselves 'the
febs,' which was an acronym for 'four-eyed bastards.'
 when the plane was safely aloft, the machine that was bill's father-in-law asked the
quartet to sing his favorite song. they knew what song he meant, and they sang it, and it
went like this:
 in my prison cell i sit,
 with my britches full of shit,
 and my balls are bouncing gently on the floor.
 and i see the bloody snag
 when she bit me in the bag.
 oh, i'll never fuck a polack any more.
 billy's father-in-law laughed and laughed at that, and he begged the quartet to sing the
other polish song he liked so much. so they sang a song from the pennsylvania coal
mines that began:
 me, and mike, ve vork in mine.
 holy shit, ve have good time.
 vunce a veek ve get our pay.
 holy shit, no vork next day.
 speaking of people from poland: billy pilgrim accidentally saw a pole hanged in
public, about three days after billy got to dresden. billy just happened to be walking to
work with some others shortly
