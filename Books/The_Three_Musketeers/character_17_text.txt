ect that very day, and the lackey waited
at table. the repast had been ordered by athos, and the lackey furnished
by porthos. he was a picard, whom the glorious musketeer had picked up
on the bridge tournelle, making rings and plashing in the water.

porthos pretended that this occupation was proof of a reflective and
contemplative organization, and he had brought him away without any
other recommendation. the noble carriage of this gentleman, for whom he
believed himself to be engaged, had won planchet--that was the name of
the picard. he felt a slight disappointment, however, when he saw that
this place was already taken by a compeer named mousqueton, and when
porthos signified to him that the state of his household, though great,
would not support two servants, and that he must enter into the service
of dâ€™artagnan. nevertheless, when he waited at the dinner given by his
master, and saw him take out a handful of gold to pay for it, he
believed his fortune made, and returned thanks to heave

n for having
thrown him into the service of such a croesus. he preserved this opinion
even after the feast, with the remnants of which he repaired his own
long abstinence; but when in the evening he made his masterâ€™s bed, the
chimeras of planchet faded away. the bed was the only one in the
apartment, which consisted of an antechamber and a bedroom. planchet
slept in the antechamber upon a coverlet taken from the bed of
dâ€™artagnan, and which dâ€™artagnan from that time made shift to do
without.

athos, on his part, had a valet whom he had trained in his service in a
thoroughly peculiar fashion, and who was named grimaud. he was very
taciturn, this worthy signor. be it understood we are speaking of athos.
during the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest intimacy
with his companions, porthos and aramis, they could remember having
oft

y to go up with him, and no one could form an idea of what
his sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real riches.

as to aramis, he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir, an
eating room, and a bedroom, which room, situated, as the others were, on
the ground floor, looked out upon a little fresh green garden, shady and
impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors.

with regard to dâ€™artagnan, we know how he was lodged, and we have
already made acquaintance with his lackey, master planchet.

dâ€™artagnan, who was by nature very curious--as people generally are who
possess the genius of intrigue--did all he could to make out who athos,
porthos, and aramis really were (for under these pseudonyms each of
these young men concealed his family name)--athos in particular, who, a
league away, savored of nobility. he addressed himself then to porthos
to gain information respecting athos and aramis, and to aramis in order
to learn something of porthos.

unfortunately porthos knew nothing o

 hours longer to enjoy themselves at table, aramis looked at
his watch, arose with a bland smile, and took leave of the company, to
go, as he said, to consult a casuist with whom he had an appointment. at
other times he would return home to write a treatise, and requested his
friends not to disturb him.

at this athos would smile, with his charming, melancholy smile, which so
became his noble countenance, and porthos would drink, swearing that
aramis would never be anything but a village cure.

planchet, dâ€™artagnanâ€™s valet, supported his good fortune nobly. he
received thirty sous per day, and for a month he returned to his
lodgings gay as a chaffinch, and affable toward his master. when the
wind of adversity began to blow upon the housekeeping of the rue des
fossoyeurs--that is to say, when the forty pistoles of king louis xiii
were consumed or nearly so--he commenced complaints which athos thought
nauseous, porthos indecent, and aramis ridiculous. athos counseled
dâ€™artagnan to dismiss

ntly never exchange ill words with him; for you, porthos,
who carry matters in such a magnificent style, and are a god to your
valet, mousqueton; and for you, aramis, who, always abstracted by your
theological studies, inspire your servant, bazin, a mild, religious man,
with a profound respect; but for me, who am without any settled means
and without resources--for me, who am neither a musketeer nor even a
guardsman, what am i to do to inspire either the affection, the terror,
or the respect in planchet?"

"this is serious," answered the three friends; "it is a family affair.
it is with valets as with wives, they must be placed at once upon the
footing in which you wish them to remain. reflect upon it."

dâ€™artagnan did reflect, and resolved to thrash planchet provisionally;
which he did with the conscientiousness that dâ€™artagnan carried into
everything. after having well beaten him, he forbade him to leave his
service without his permission. "for," added he, "the future cannot fail
to mend
 
 ___________________________
 
; i inevitably look for better times. your fortune is therefore
made if you remain with me, and i am too good a master to allow you to
miss such a chance by granting you the dismissal you require."

this manner of acting roused much respect for dâ€™artagnanâ€™s policy among
the musketeers. planchet was equally seized with admiration, and said no
more about going away.

the life of the four young men had become fraternal. dâ€™artagnan, who had
no settled habits of his own, as he came from his province into the
midst of a world quite new to him, fell easily into the habits of his
friends.

they rose about eight oâ€™clock in the winter, about six in summer, and
went to take the countersign and see how things went on at m. de
trevilleâ€™s. dâ€™artagnan, although he was not a musketeer, perfor

amis had eight of
them. he was a man, as must have been already perceived, who made but
little noise, and yet was much sought after.

as to dâ€™artagnan, who as yet knew nobody in the capital, he only found
one chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province,
and one dinner at the house of a cornet of the guards. he took his army
to the priestâ€™s, where they devoured as much provision as would have
lasted him for two months, and to the cornetâ€™s, who performed wonders;
but as planchet said, "people do not eat at once for all time, even when
they eat a good deal."

dâ€™artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal
and a half for his companions--as the breakfast at the priestâ€™s could
only be counted as half a repast--in return for the feasts which athos,
porthos, and aramis had procured him. he fancied himself a burden to the
society, forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith that he had fed
this society for a month; and he set his mind activel

 object they wished to attain, however well
it might be defended, or however distant it may seem. the only thing
that astonished dâ€™artagnan was that his friends had never thought of
this.

he was thinking by himself, and even seriously racking his brain to find
a direction for this single force four times multiplied, with which he
did not doubt, as with the lever for which archimedes sought, they
should succeed in moving the world, when someone tapped gently at his
door. dâ€™artagnan awakened planchet and ordered him to open it.

from this phrase, "dâ€™artagnan awakened planchet," the reader must not
suppose it was night, or that day was hardly come. no, it had just
struck four. planchet, two hours before, had asked his master for some
dinner, and he had answered him with the proverb, "he who sleeps,
dines." and planchet dined by sleeping.

a man was introduced of simple mien, who had the appearance of a
tradesman. planchet, by way of dessert, would have liked to hear the
conversation; but t

he citizen declared to dâ€™artagnan that, what he had
to say being important and confidential, he desired to be left alone
with him.

dâ€™artagnan dismissed planchet, and requested his visitor to be seated.
there was a moment of silence, during which the two men looked at each
other, as if to make a preliminary acquaintance, after which dâ€™artagnan
bowed, as a sign that he listened.

"i have heard monsieur dâ€™artagnan spoken of as a very brave young man,"
said the citizen; "and this reputation which he justly enjoys had
decided me to confide a secret to him."

"speak, monsieur, speak," said dâ€™artagnan, who instinctively scented
something advantageous.

f faith that i should be
very sorry to see any doubt thrown upon, porthos."

"at all events, man or devil, body or shadow, illusion or reality, this
man is born for my damnation; for his flight has caused us to miss a
glorious affair, gentlemen--an affair by which there were a hundred
pistoles, and perhaps more, to be gained."

"how is that?" cried porthos and aramis in a breath.

as to athos, faithful to his system of reticence, he contented himself
with interrogating dâ€™artagnan by a look.

"planchet," said dâ€™artagnan to his domestic, who just then insinuated
his head through the half-open door in order to catch some fragments of
the conversation, "go down to my landlord, monsieur bonacieux, and ask
him to send me half a dozen bottles of beaugency wine; i prefer that."

"ah, ah! you have credit with your landlord, then?" asked porthos.

"yes," replied dâ€™artagnan, "from this very day; and mind, if the wine is
bad, we will send him to find better."

"we must use, and not abuse," said aram

they want to know if the duke of buckingham is in paris, and if he has
had, or is likely to have, an interview with the queen."

dâ€™artagnan held onto this idea, which, from what he had heard, was not
wanting in probability.

in the meantime, the mousetrap continued in operation, and likewise
dâ€™artagnanâ€™s vigilance.

on the evening of the day after the arrest of poor bonacieux, as athos
had just left dâ€™artagnan to report at m. de trevilleâ€™s, as nine oâ€™clock
had just struck, and as planchet, who had not yet made the bed, was
beginning his task, a knocking was heard at the street door. the door
was instantly opened and shut; someone was taken in the mousetrap.

dâ€™artagnan flew to his hole, laid himself down on the floor at full
length, and listened.

cries were soon heard, and then moans, which someone appeared to be
endeavoring to stifle. there were no questions.

"the devil!" said dâ€™artagnan to himself. "it seems like a woman! they
search her; she resists; they use force--the

onacieux!" murmured dâ€™artagnan. "can i be so lucky as to find
what everybody is seeking for?"

the voice became more and more indistinct; a tumultuous movement shook
the partition. the victim resisted as much as a woman could resist four
men.

"pardon, gentlemen--par--" murmured the voice, which could now only be
heard in inarticulate sounds.

"they are binding her; they are going to drag her away," cried
dâ€™artagnan to himself, springing up from the floor. "my sword! good, it
is by my side! planchet!"

"monsieur."

"run and seek athos, porthos and aramis. one of the three will certainly
be at home, perhaps all three. tell them to take arms, to come here, and
to run! ah, i remember, athos is at monsieur de trevilleâ€™s."

"but where are you going, monsieur, where are you going?"

"i am going down by the window, in order to be there the sooner," cried
dâ€™artagnan. "you put back the boards, sweep the floor, go out at the
door, and run as i told you."

"oh, monsieur! monsieur! you will kill y

ourself," cried planchet.

"hold your tongue, stupid fellow," said dâ€™artagnan; and laying hold of
the casement, he let himself gently down from the first story, which
fortunately was not very elevated, without doing himself the slightest
injury.

he then went straight to the door and knocked, murmuring, "i will go
myself and be caught in the mousetrap, but woe be to the cats that shall
pounce upon such a mouse!"

the knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before
the tumult ceased, steps approach

 will not forget him, and we know where he is. but for
the moment, let us do as did the amorous gascon; we will see after the
worthy mercer later.

dâ€™artagnan, reflecting on his future amours, addressing himself to the
beautiful night, and smiling at the stars, ascended the rue
cherish-midi, or chase-midi, as it was then called. as he found himself
in the quarter in which aramis lived, he took it into his head to pay
his friend a visit in order to explain the motives which had led him to
send planchet with a request that he would come instantly to the
mousetrap. now, if aramis had been at home when planchet came to his
abode, he had doubtless hastened to the rue des fossoyeurs, and finding
nobody there but his other two companions perhaps, they would not be
able to conceive what all this meant. this mystery required an
explanation; at least, so dâ€™artagnan declared to himself.

he likewise thought this was an opportunity for talking about pretty
little mme. bonacieux, of whom his head, if n

ve minutes later he was in
the rue des fossoyeurs.

"poor athos!" said he; "he will never guess what all this means. he will
have fallen asleep waiting for me, or else he will have returned home,
where he will have learned that a woman had been there. a woman with
athos! after all," continued dâ€™artagnan, "there was certainly one with
aramis. all this is very strange; and i am curious to know how it will
end."

"badly, monsieur, badly!" replied a voice which the young man recognized
as that of planchet; for, soliloquizing aloud, as very preoccupied
people do, he had entered the alley, at the end of which were the stairs
which led to his chamber.

"how, badly? what do you mean by that, you idiot?" asked dâ€™artagnan.
"what has happened?"

"all sorts of misfortunes."

"what?"

"in the first place, monsieur athos is arrested."

"arrested! athos arrested! what for?"

"he was found in your lodging; they took him for you."

"and by whom was he arrested?"

"by guards brought by the men in black whom

house empty and exposed."

"and porthos and aramis?"

"i could not find them; they did not come."

"but they may come any moment, for you left word that i awaited them?"

"yes, monsieur."

"well, donâ€™t budge, then; if they come, tell them what has happened. let
them wait for me at the pomme-de-pin. here it would be dangerous; the
house may be watched. i will run to monsieur de treville to tell them
all this, and will meet them there."

"very well, monsieur," said planchet.

"but you will remain; you are not afraid?" said dâ€™artagnan, coming back
to recommend courage to his lackey.

"be easy, monsieur," said planchet; "you do not know me yet. i am brave
when i set about it. it is all in beginning. besides, i am a picard."

"then it is understood," said dâ€™artagnan; "you would rather be killed
than desert your post?"

"yes, monsieur; and there is nothing i would not do to prove to monsieur
that i am attached to him."

"good!" said dâ€™artagnan to himself. "it ap

see no light shine through the chinks of the shutters."

"all the same, it is well to be certain."

"how so?"

"by knocking at his door. go."

"i will ask his servant."

bonacieux re-entered the house, passed through the same door that had
afforded a passage for the two fugitives, went up to dâ€™artagnanâ€™s door,
and knocked.

no one answered. porthos, in order to make a greater display, had that
evening borrowed planchet. as to dâ€™artagnan, he took care not to give
the least sign of existence.

the moment the hand of bonacieux sounded on the door, the two young
people felt their hearts bound within them.

"there is nobody within," said bonacieux.

"never mind. let us return to your apartment. we shall be safer there
than in the doorway."

"ah, my god!" whispered mme. bonacieux, "we shall hear no more."

"on the contrary," said dâ€™artagnan, "we shall hear better."

dâ€™artagnan raised the three or four boards

where we are told to go. is life worth the trouble of so many questions?
dâ€™artagnan, i am ready to follow you."

"and i also," said porthos.

"and i also," said aramis. "and, indeed, i am not sorry to quit paris; i
had need of distraction."

"well, you will have distractions enough, gentlemen, be assured," said
dâ€™artagnan.

"and, now, when are we to go?" asked athos.

"immediately," replied dâ€™artagnan; "we have not a minute to lose."

"hello, grimaud! planchet! mousqueton! bazin!" cried the four young men,
calling their lackeys, "clean my boots, and fetch the horses from the
hotel."

each musketeer was accustomed to leave at the general hotel, as at a
barrack, his own horse and that of his lackey. planchet, grimaud,
mousqueton, and bazin set off at full speed.

"now let us lay down the plan of campaign," said porthos. "where do we
go first?"

"to calais," said dâ€™artagnan; "that is the most direct line to london."

"well," said porthos, "this is my

advice--"

"speak!"

"four men traveling together would be suspected. dâ€™artagnan will give
each of us his instructions. i will go by the way of boulogne to clear
the way; athos will set out two hours after, by that of amiens; aramis
will follow us by that of noyon; as to dâ€™artagnan, he will go by what
route he thinks is best, in planchetâ€™s clothes, while planchet will
follow us like dâ€™artagnan, in the uniform of the guards."

"gentlemen," said athos, "my opinion is that it is not proper to allow
lackeys to have anything to do in such an affair. a secret may, by
chance, be betrayed by gentlemen; but it is almost always sold by
lackeys."

"porthosâ€™s plan appears to me to be impracticable," said dâ€™artagnan,
"inasmuch as i am myself ignorant of what instructions i can give you. i
am the bearer of a letter, that is all. i have not, and i cannot make

ther. in fact, it required all the courage which he
concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so
far. he grew more pale every minute, and they were obliged to support
him on his horse. they lifted him off at the door of a cabaret, left
bazin with him, who, besides, in a skirmish was more embarrassing than
useful, and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at amiens.

"morbleu," said athos, as soon as they were again in motion, "reduced to
two masters and grimaud and planchet! morbleu! i wonâ€™t be their dupe, i
will answer for it. i will neither open my mouth nor draw my sword
between this and calais. i swear by--"

"donâ€™t waste time in swearing," said dâ€™artagnan; "let us gallop, if our
horses will consent."

and the travelers buried their rowels in their horsesâ€™ flanks, who thus
vigorously stimulated recovered their energies. they arrived at amiens
at midnight, and alighted at the auberge of the golden lily.

the host had the appearance of as honest a man as

he host replied that he had no other worthy of their excellencies; but
the travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber, each on a
mattress which might be thrown upon the ground. the host insisted; but
the travelers were firm, and he was obliged to do as they wished.

they had just prepared their beds and barricaded their door within, when
someone knocked at the yard shutter; they demanded who was there, and
recognizing the voices of their lackeys, opened the shutter. it was
indeed planchet and grimaud.

"grimaud can take care of the horses," said planchet. "if you are
willing, gentlemen, i will sleep across your doorway, and you will then
be certain that nobody can reach you."

"and on what will you sleep?" said dâ€™artagnan.

"here is my bed," replied planchet, producing a bundle of straw.

"come, then," said dâ€™artagnan, "you are right. mine hostâ€™s face does not
please me at all; it is too gracious."

"nor me either," said athos.

planchet mounted by the window and installed

 himself across the doorway,
while grimaud went and shut himself up in the stable, undertaking that
by five oâ€™clock in the morning he and the four horses should be ready.

the night was quiet enough. toward two oâ€™clock in the morning somebody
endeavored to open the door; but as planchet awoke in an instant and
cried, "who goes there?" somebody replied that he was mistaken, and went
away.

at four oâ€™clock in the morning they heard a terrible riot in the
stables. grimaud had tried to waken the stable boys, and the stable boys
had beaten him. when they opened the window, they saw the poor lad lying
senseless, with his head split by a blow with a pitchfork.

planchet went down into the yard, and wished to saddle the horses; but
the horses were all used up. mousquetonâ€™s horse w

to pursue the journey; but by an inconceivable error the veterinary
surgeon, who had been sent for, as it appeared, to bleed one of the
hostâ€™s horses, had bled mousquetonâ€™s.

this began to be annoying. all these successive accidents were perhaps
the result of chance; but they might be the fruits of a plot. athos and
dâ€™artagnan went out, while planchet was sent to inquire if there were
not three horses for sale in the neighborhood. at the door stood two
horses, fresh, strong, and fully equipped. these would just have suited
them. he asked where their masters were, and was informed that they had
passed the night in the inn, and were then settling their bill with the
host.

athos went down to pay the reckoning, while dâ€™artagnan and planchet
stood at the street door. the host was in a lower and back room, to
which athos was requested to go.

to him, and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands,
suddenly cried out that it was bad, and that he would have him and his
companions arrested as forgers.

"you blackguard!" cried athos, going toward him, "iâ€™ll cut your ears
off!"

at the same instant, four men, armed to the teeth, entered by side
doors, and rushed upon athos.

"i am taken!" shouted athos, with all the power of his lungs. "go on,
dâ€™artagnan! spur, spur!" and he fired two pistols.

dâ€™artagnan and planchet did not require twice bidding; they unfastened
the two horses that were waiting at the door, leaped upon them, buried
their spurs in their sides, and set off at full gallop.

"do you know what has become of athos?" asked dâ€™artagnan of planchet, as
they galloped on.

"ah, monsieur," said planchet, "i saw one fall at each of his two shots,
and he appeared to me, through the glass door, to be fighting with his
sword with the others."

"brave athos!" murmured dâ€™artagnan, "and to think that we a

planchet, forward! you are a brave fellow."

"as i told you, monsieur," replied planchet, "picards are found out by
being used. besides, i am here in my own country, and that excites me."

and both, with free use of the spur, arrived at st. omer without drawing
bit. at st. omer they breathed their horses with the bridles passed
under their arms for fear of accident, and ate a morsel from their hands
on the stones of the street, after they departed again.

at a hundred paces from the gates of calais, dâ€™artagnanâ€™s horse gave
out, and could not by any means be made to get up again

, the blood
flowing from his eyes and his nose. there still remained planchetâ€™s
horse; but he stopped short, and could not be made to move a step.

fortunately, as we have said, they were within a hundred paces of the
city; they left their two nags upon the high road, and ran toward the
quay. planchet called his masterâ€™s attention to a gentleman who had just
arrived with his lackey, and only preceded them by about fifty paces.
they made all speed to come up to this gentleman, who appeared to be in
great haste. his boots were covered with dust, and he inquired if he
could not instantly cross over to england.

"nothing would be more easy," said the captain of a vessel ready to set
sail, "but this morning came an order to let no one leave without
express permission from the cardinal."

"i hav

e gentleman, drawing the paper from his
pocket; "here it is."

"have it examined by the governor of the port," said the shipmaster,
"and give me the preference."

"where shall i find the governor?"

"at his country house."

"and that is situated?"

"at a quarter of a league from the city. look, you may see it from
here--at the foot of that little hill, that slated roof."

"very well," said the gentleman. and, with his lackey, he took the road
to the governorâ€™s country house.

dâ€™artagnan and planchet followed the gentleman at a distance of five
hundred paces. once outside the city, dâ€™artagnan overtook the gentleman
as he was entering a little wood.

"monsieur, you appear to be in great haste?"

"no one can be more so, monsieur."

"i am sorry for that," said dâ€™artagnan; "for as i am in great haste
likewise, i wish to beg you to render me a service."

"what?"

"to let me sail first."

"thatâ€™s impossible," said the gentleman; "i have traveled sixty leagues
in forty hours, and by tomorrow

"my own service!" said dâ€™artagnan.

"but this is a needless quarrel you seek with me, as it seems to me."

"parbleu! what do you desire it to be?"

"what do you want?"

"would you like to know?"

"certainly."

"well, then, i wish that order of which you are bearer, seeing that i
have not one of my own and must have one."

"you jest, i presume."

"i never jest."

"let me pass!"

"you shall not pass."

"my brave young man, i will blow out your brains. hola, lubin, my
pistols!"

"planchet," called out dâ€™artagnan, "take care of the lackey; i will
manage the master."

planchet, emboldened by the first exploit, sprang upon lubin; and being
strong and vigorous, he soon got him on the broad of his back, and
placed his knee upon his breast.

"go on with your affair, monsieur," cried planchet; "i have finished
mine."

seeing this, the gentleman drew his sword, and sprang upon dâ€™artagnan;
but he had too strong an adversary. in three seconds dâ€™artagnan had
wounded him three times,

ame of comte de wardes.

then, casting a glance on the handsome young man, who was scarcely
twenty-five years of age, and whom he was leaving in his gore, deprived
of sense and perhaps dead, he gave a sigh for that unaccountable destiny
which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of people who
are strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist.
but he was soon aroused from these reflections by lubin, who uttered
loud cries and screamed for help with all his might.

planchet grasped him by the throat, and pressed as hard as he could.
"monsieur," said he, "as long as i hold him in this manner, he canâ€™t
cry, iâ€™ll be bound; but as soon as i let go he will howl again. i know
him for a norman, and normans are obstinate."

in fact, tightly held as he was, lubin endeavored still to cry out.

"stay!" said dâ€™artagnan; and taking out his handkerchief, he gagged him.

"now," said planchet, "let us bind him to a tree."

this being properly done, they drew the comte de wa
 
 ___________________________
 
rdes close to his
servant; and as night was approaching, and as the wounded man and the
bound man were at some little distance within the wood, it was evident
they were likely to remain there till the next day.

"and now," said dâ€™artagnan, "to the governorâ€™s."

"but you are wounded, it seems," said planchet.

"oh, thatâ€™s nothing! let us attend to what is more pressing first, and
then we will attend to my wound; besides, it does not seem very
dangerous."

and they both set forward as fast as they could toward the country house
of the worthy functionary.

the comte de wardes was announced, and dâ€™artagnan was introduced.

"you have an order signed by the cardinal?" said the governor.

"yes, monsieur," replied dâ€™artagnan; "here it is."

"ah, ah! it is quite regular and explicit," said the govern

escort."

"and by doing so, monsieur the governor," said dâ€™artagnan, "you will
deserve well of the cardinal."

"shall you see him on your return, monsieur count?"

"without a doubt."

"tell him, i beg you, that i am his humble servant."

"i will not fail."

delighted with this assurance the governor countersigned the passport
and delivered it to dâ€™artagnan. dâ€™artagnan lost no time in useless
compliments. he thanked the governor, bowed, and departed. once outside,
he and planchet set off as fast as they could; and by making a long
detour avoided the wood and reentered the city by another gate.

the vessel was quite ready to sail, and the captain was waiting on the
wharf. "well?" said he, on perceiving dâ€™artagnan.

"here is my pass countersigned," said the latter.

"and that other gentleman?

"he will not go today," said dâ€™artagnan; "but here, iâ€™ll pay you for us
two."

"in that case let us go," said the shipmaster.

"let us go," repeated dâ€™artagnan.

ith planchet into the boat, and five minutes after they were
on board. it was time; for they had scarcely sailed half a league, when
dâ€™artagnan saw a flash and heard a detonation. it was the cannon which
announced the closing of the port.

he had now leisure to look to his wound. fortunately, as dâ€™artagnan had
thought, it was not dangerous. the point of the sword had touched a rib,
and glanced along the bone. still further, his shirt had stuck to the
wound, and he had lost only a few drops of blood.

for him. he threw himself upon it, and fell asleep.

on the morrow, at break of day, they were still three or four leagues
from the coast of england. the breeze had been so light all night, they
had made but little progress. at ten oâ€™clock the vessel cast anchor in
the harbor of dover, and at half past ten dâ€™artagnan placed his foot on
english land, crying, "here i am at last!"

but that was not all; they must get to london. in england the post was
well served. dâ€™artagnan and planchet took each a post horse, and a
postillion rode before them. in a few hours they were in the capital.

dâ€™artagnan did not know london; he did not know a word of english; but
he wrote the name of buckingham on a piece of paper, and everyone
pointed out to him the way to the dukeâ€™s hotel.

the duke was at windsor hunting with the king. dâ€™artagnan inquired for
the confidential valet of the duke, who, having accompanied him in all
his voyages, spoke french perfectly well; he told him that he ca

me from
paris on an affair of life and death, and that he must speak with his
master instantly.

the confidence with which dâ€™artagnan spoke convinced patrick, which was
the name of this minister of the minister. he ordered two horses to be
saddled, and himself went as guide to the young guardsman. as for
planchet, he had been lifted from his horse as stiff as a rush; the poor
ladâ€™s strength was almost exhausted. dâ€™artagnan seemed iron.

on their arrival at the castle they learned that buckingham and the king
were hawking in the marshes two or three leagues away. in twenty minutes
they were on the spot named. patrick soon caught the sound of his
masterâ€™s voice calling his falcon.

"whom must i announce to my lord duke?" asked patrick.

"the young man who one evening sought a quarrel with him on the

eyed like a child, without the
least resistance or objection, which proved that he was really in love.




23 the rendezvous


dâ€™artagnan ran home immediately, and although it was three oâ€™clock in
the morning and he had some of the worst quarters of paris to traverse,
he met with no misadventure. everyone knows that drunkards and lovers
have a protecting deity.

he found the door of his passage open, sprang up the stairs and knocked
softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey. planchet*,
whom he had sent home two hours before from the hotel de ville, telling
him to sit up for him, opened the door for him.

_*the reader may ask, "how came planchet here?" when he was left
"stiff as a rush" in london. in the intervening time
buckingham perhaps sent him to paris, as he did the
horses._

"has anyone brought a letter for me?" asked dâ€™artagnan, eagerly.

"no one has brought a letter, monsieur," replied planchet; "but one has
come of itself."

"what do you mean, blockhead?"

"i mea

 in front of the
pavilion which stands at the corner of the house of m. dâ€™estrees.--c.b."

while reading this letter, dâ€™artagnan felt his heart dilated and
compressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the
hearts of lovers.

it was the first billet he had received; it was the first rendezvous
that had been granted him. his heart, swelled by the intoxication of
joy, felt ready to dissolve away at the very gate of that terrestrial
paradise called love!

"well, monsieur," said planchet, who had observed his master grow red
and pale successively, "did i not guess truly? is it not some bad
affair?"

"you are mistaken, planchet," replied dâ€™artagnan; "and as a proof, there
is a crown to drink my health."

"i am much obliged to monsieur for the crown he had given me, and i
promise him to follow his instructions exactly; but it is not the less
true that letters which come in this way into shut-up houses--"

"fall from heaven, my friend, fall from heaven."

"then monsieur is satis

fied?" asked planchet.

"my dear planchet, i am the happiest of men!"

"and i may profit by monsieurâ€™s happiness, and go to bed?"

"yes, go."

"may the blessings of heaven fall upon monsieur! but it is not the less
true that that letter--"

and planchet retired, shaking his head with an air of doubt, which the
liberality of dâ€™artagnan had not entirely effaced.

left alone, dâ€™artagnan read and reread his billet. then he kissed and
rekissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful
mistress. at length he went to bed, fell asleep, and had golden dreams.

at seven oâ€™clock in the morning he arose and called planchet, who at the
second summons opened the door, his countenance not yet quite freed from
the anxiety of the precedi

ng night.

"planchet," said dâ€™artagnan, "i am going out for all day, perhaps. you
are, therefore, your own master till seven oâ€™clock in the evening; but
at seven oâ€™clock you must hold yourself in readiness with two horses."

"there!" said planchet. "we are going again, it appears, to have our
hides pierced in all sorts of ways."

"you will take your musketoon and your pistols."

"there, now! didnâ€™t i say so?" cried planchet. "i was sure of it--the
cursed letter!"

"donâ€™t be afraid, you idiot; there is nothing in hand but a party of
pleasure."

"ah, like the charming journey the other day, when it rained bullets and
produced a crop of steel traps!"

"well, if you are really afraid, monsieur planchet," resumed dâ€™artagnan,
"i will go without you. i prefer traveling alone to having a companion
who entertains the least fear."

"monsieur does me wrong," said planchet; "i thought he had seen me at
work."

"yes, but i

to be too prodigal of it if he wishes it to last long."

"do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this
evening?"

"i hope so, monsieur."

"well, then, i count on you."

"at the appointed hour i shall be ready; only i believed that monsieur
had but one horse in the guard stables."

"perhaps there is but one at this moment; but by this evening there will
be four."

"it appears that our journey was a remounting journey, then?"

"exactly so," said dâ€™artagnan; and nodding to planchet, he went out.

m bonacieux was at his door. dâ€™artagnanâ€™s intention was to go out
without speaking to the worthy mercer; but the latter made so polite and
friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged, not only to stop,
but to enter into conversation with him.

besides, how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a
husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same
evening at st. cloud, opposite dâ€™estreesâ€™s pavilion? dâ€™artagnan
approached him with t

off?--for i do not forget that i owe to that unpleasant circumstance the
good fortune of having made your acquaintance."

"ah!" said bonacieux, "they took good care not to tell me that; and my
wife, on her part, has sworn to me by all thatâ€™s sacred that she does
not know. but you," continued m. bonacieux, in a tone of perfect good
fellowship, "what has become of you all these days? i have not seen you
nor your friends, and i donâ€™t think you could gather all that dust that
i saw planchet brush off your boots yesterday from the pavement of
paris."

"you are right, my dear monsieur bonacieux, my friends and i have been
on a little journey."

"far from here?"

"oh, lord, no! about forty leagues only. we went to take monsieur athos
to the waters of forges, where my friends still remain."

"and you have returned, have you not?" replied m. bonacieux, giving to
his countenance a most sly air. "a handsome young fellow like you does
not obtain long leaves of absence from his mistress; a

solicitude for his musketeers.

he called successively at the abodes of athos, porthos, and aramis.
neither of them had returned. their lackeys likewise were absent, and
nothing had been heard of either the one or the other. he would have
inquired after them of their mistresses, but he was neither acquainted
with porthosâ€™s nor aramisâ€™s, and as to athos, he had none.

as he passed the hotel des gardes, he took a glance in to the stables.
three of the four horses had already arrived. planchet, all
astonishment, was busy grooming them, and had already finished two.

"ah, monsieur," said planchet, on perceiving dâ€™artagnan, "how glad i am
to see you."

"why so, planchet?" asked the young man.

"do you place confidence in our landlord--monsieur bonacieux?"

"i? not the least in the world."

"oh, you do quite right, monsieur."

"but why this question?"

"because, while you were talking with him, i watched you without
listening to you; and, monsieur, his countenance changed color two or

ccupied as monsieur was with the letter he had received, he did not
observe that; but i, whom the strange fashion in which that letter came
into the house had placed on my guard--i did not lose a movement of his
features."

"and you found it?"

"traitorous, monsieur."

"indeed!"

"still more; as soon as monsieur had left and disappeared round the
corner of the street, monsieur bonacieux took his hat, shut his door,
and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction."

"it seems you are right, planchet; all this appears to be a little
mysterious; and be assured that we will not pay him our rent until the
matter shall be categorically explained to us."

"monsieur jests, but monsieur will see."

"what would you have, planchet? what must come is written."

"monsieur does not then renounce his excursion for this evening?"

"quite the contrary, planchet; the more ill will i have toward monsieur
bonacieux, the more punctual i shall be in keeping the appointment made
by that letter which makes you s
 
 ___________________________
 
o uneasy."

"then that is monsieurâ€™s determination?"

"undeniably, my friend. at nine oâ€™clock, then, be ready here at the
hotel, i will come and take you."

planchet seeing there was no longer any hope of making his master
renounce his project, heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom
the third horse.

as to dâ€™artagnan, being at bottom a prudent youth, instead of returning
home, went and dined with the gascon priest, who, at the time of the
distress of the four friends, had given them a breakfast of chocolate.




24 the pavilion


at nine oâ€™clock dâ€™artagnan was at the hotel des gardes; he found
planchet all ready. the fourth horse had arrived.
 
 ___________________________
 


planchet was armed with his musketoon and a pistol. dâ€™artagnan had his
sword and placed two pistols in his belt; then both mounted and departed
quietly. it was quite dark, and no one saw them go out. planchet took
place behind his master, and kept at a distance of ten paces from him.

dâ€™artagnan crossed the quays, went out by the gate of la conference and
followed the road, much more beautiful then than it is now, which leads
to st. cloud.

as long as he was in the city, planchet kept at the respectful distance
he had imposed upon himself; but as soon as the road began to be more
lonely and dark, he drew softly nearer, so that when they entered the
bois de boulogne he found himself riding quite naturally side by side
with his master. in fact, we must not dissemble that the oscillation of
the tall trees and the reflection of the moon in the dark underwood gave
him serious uneasiness. dâ€™artagnan could not help perceiving that
something more than usual was passing in the

 mind of his lackey and
said, "well, monsieur planchet, what is the matter with us now?"

"donâ€™t you think, monsieur, that woods are like churches?"

"how so, planchet?"

"because we dare not speak aloud in one or the other."

"but why did you not dare to speak aloud, planchet--because you are
afraid?"

"afraid of being heard? yes, monsieur."

"afraid of being heard! why, there is nothing improper in our
conversation, my dear planchet, and no one could find fault with it."

"ah, monsieur!" replied planchet, recurring to his besetting idea, "that
monsieur bonacieux has something vicious in his eyebrows, and something
very unpleasant in the play of his lips."

"what the devil makes you think of bonacieux?"

"monsieur, we think of what we can, and not of what we will."

"because you are a coward, planchet."

"monsieur, we must not confound prudence with cowardice; prudence is a
virtue."

"and you are very virtuous, are you not,
 
 ___________________________
 
 planchet?"

"monsieur, is not that the barrel of a musket which glitters yonder? had
we not better lower our heads?"

"in truth," murmured dâ€™artagnan, to whom m. de trevilleâ€™s recommendation
recurred, "this animal will end by making me afraid." and he put his
horse into a trot.

planchet followed the movements of his master as if he had been his
shadow, and was soon trotting by his side.

"are we going to continue this pace all night?" asked planchet.

"no; you are at your journeyâ€™s end."

"how, monsieur! and you?"

"i am going a few steps farther."

"and monsieur leaves me here alone?"

"you are afraid, planchet?"

"no; i only beg leave to observe to monsieur that the night will be very
cold, that chills bring on rheumatism, and that a lackey who has the
rheumatism makes but a poor servant, particularly to a master as active
as monsieur."

"well, if you are cold, planchet, you can go into one of those cabarets
that you see yonder, and be
 
 ___________________________
 
 in waiting for me at the door by six oâ€™clock
in the morning."

"monsieur, i have eaten and drunk respectfully the crown you gave me
this morning, so that i have not a sou left in case i should be cold."

"hereâ€™s half a pistole. tomorrow morning."

dâ€™artagnan sprang from his horse, threw the bridle to planchet, and
departed at a quick pace, folding his cloak around him.

"good lord, how cold i am!" cried planchet, as soon as he had lost sight
of his master; and in such haste was he to warm himself that he went
straight to a house set out with all the attributes of a suburban
tavern, and knocked at the door.

in the meantime dâ€™artagnan, who had plunged into a bypath, continued his
route and reached st. cloud; but instead of following the main street he
turned behind the chateau, reached a sort of retired lane, and found
himself soon in front of the pavilion named. it was situated in a very
private spot

again bent his way toward the ferry.
sometimes he hoped it could not be mme. bonacieux, and that he should
find her next day at the louvre; sometimes he feared she had had an
intrigue with another, who, in a jealous fit, had surprised her and
carried her off. his mind was torn by doubt, grief, and despair.

"oh, if i had my three friends here," cried he, "i should have, at
least, some hopes of finding her; but who knows what has become of
them?"

it was past midnight; the next thing was to find planchet. dâ€™artagnan
went successively into all the cabarets in which there was a light, but
could not find planchet in any of them.

at the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather dubious.
dâ€™artagnan had appointed six oâ€™clock in the morning for his lackey, and
wherever he might be, he was right.

besides, it came into the young manâ€™s mind that by remaining in the
environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed, he would,
perhaps, have some light thrown upon the mysterious a

le feeling
which generally accompanies the break of day after a bad night. he was
not long in making his toilet. he examined himself to see if advantage
had been taken of his sleep, and having found his diamond ring on his
finger, his purse in his pocket, and his pistols in his belt, he rose,
paid for his bottle, and went out to try if he could have any better
luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before.
the first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest
planchet, who, with the two horses in hand, awaited him at the door of a
little blind cabaret, before which dâ€™artagnan had passed without even a
suspicion of its existence.




25 porthos


instead of returning directly home, dâ€™artagnan alighted at the door of
m. de treville, and ran quickly up the stairs. this time he had decided
to relate all that had passed. m. de treville would doubtless give him
good advice as to the whole affair. besides, as m. de treville saw the
queen almost daily, he might

felt a lively interest in this young man, so brave and so resolute,
pressed his hand kindly, wishing him a pleasant journey.

determined to put the advice of m. de treville in practice instantly,
dâ€™artagnan directed his course toward the rue des fossoyeurs, in order
to superintend the packing of his valise. on approaching the house, he
perceived m. bonacieux in morning costume, standing at his threshold.
all that the prudent planchet had said to him the preceding evening
about the sinister character of the old man recurred to the mind of
dâ€™artagnan, who looked at him with more attention than he had done
before. in fact, in addition to that yellow, sickly paleness which
indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood, and which might,
besides, be accidental, dâ€™artagnan remarked something perfidiously
significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance. a
rogue does not laugh in the same way that an hon

at is never refused among neighbors."

without waiting for the permission of his host, dâ€™artagnan went quickly
into the house, and cast a rapid glance at the bed. it had not been
used. bonacieux had not been abed. he had only been back an hour or two;
he had accompanied his wife to the place of her confinement, or else at
least to the first relay.

"thanks, monsieur bonacieux," said dâ€™artagnan, emptying his glass, "that
is all i wanted of you. i will now go up into my apartment. i will make
planchet brush my boots; and when he has done, i will, if you like, send
him to you to brush your shoes."

he left the mercer quite astonished at his singular farewell, and asking
himself if he had not been a little inconsiderate.

at the top of the stairs he found planchet in a great fright.

"ah, monsieur!" cried planchet, as soon as he perceived his master,
"here is more trouble. i thought you would never come in."

"whatâ€™s the matter now, planchet?" demanded dâ€™artagnan.

"oh! i give you a hundre
 
 ___________________________
 
ay; and
then he added in a low voice, â€™tell your master that his eminence is
very well disposed toward him, and that his fortune perhaps depends upon
this interview.â€™"

"the snare is rather maladroit for the cardinal," replied the young man,
smiling.

"oh, i saw the snare, and i answered you would be quite in despair on
your return.

"â€™where has he gone?â€™ asked monsieur de cavois.

"â€™to troyes, in champagne,â€™ i answered.

"â€™and when did he set out?â€™

"â€™yesterday evening.â€™"

"planchet, my friend," interrupted dâ€™artagnan, "you are really a
precious fellow."

"you will understand, monsieur, i thought there would be still time, if
you wish, to see monsieur de cavois to contradict me by saying you were
not yet gone. the falsehood would then lie at my door, and as i am not a
gentleman, i may be allowed to lie."

"be of good heart, planchet, you shall preserve your reputation as a
veracious man. in a quarter of an hour we set off."

"thatâ€™s the advice i was about to give monsi
 
 ___________________________
 
eur; and where are we going,
may i ask, without being too curious?"

"pardieu! in the opposite direction to that which you said i was gone.
besides, are you not as anxious to learn news of grimaud, mousqueton,
and bazin as i am to know what has become of athos, porthos, and
aramis?"

"yes, monsieur," said planchet, "and i will go as soon as you please.
indeed, i think provincial air will suit us much better just now than
the air of paris. so then--"

"so then, pack up our luggage, planchet, and let us be off. on my part,
i will go out with my hands in my pockets, that nothing may be
suspected. you may join me at the hotel des gardes. by the way,
planchet, i think you are right with respect to our host, and that he is
decidedly a frightfully low wretch."

"ah, monsieur, you may take my word when i tell you anything. i am a
physiognomist, i assure you."

dâ€™artagnan went out first, as had been agreed upon. then, in order that
he might have nothing to reproach himself with, he dire
 
 ___________________________
 
cted his steps,
for the last time, toward the residences of his three friends. no news
had been received of them; only a letter, all perfumed and of an elegant
writing in small characters, had come for aramis. dâ€™artagnan took charge
of it. ten minutes afterward planchet joined him at the stables of the
hotel des gardes. dâ€™artagnan, in order that there might be no time lost,
had saddled his horse himself.

"thatâ€™s well," said he to planchet, when the latter added the
portmanteau to the equipment. "now saddle the other three horses."

"do you think, then, monsieur, that we shall travel faster with two
horses apiece?" said planchet, with his shrewd air.

"no, monsieur jester," replied dâ€™artagnan; "but with our four horses we
may bring back our three friends, if we should have the good fortune to
find them living."

"which is a great chance," replied planchet, "but we must not despair of
the mercy of god."

"amen!" said dâ€™artagna

n, getting into his saddle.

as they went from the hotel des gardes, they separated, leaving the
street at opposite ends, one having to quit paris by the barriere de la
villette and the other by the barriere montmartre, to meet again beyond
st. denis--a strategic maneuver which, having been executed with equal
punctuality, was crowned with the most fortunate results. dâ€™artagnan and
planchet entered pierrefitte together.

planchet was more courageous, it must be admitted, by day than by night.
his natural prudence, however, never forsook him for a single instant.
he had forgotten not one of the incidents of the first journey, and he
looked upon everybody he met on the road as an enemy. it followed that
his hat was forever in his hand, which procured him some severe
reprimands from dâ€™artagnan, who feared that his excess of politeness
would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no consequence.

nevertheless,

of planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young manâ€™s

alighted at the tavern of great st. martin, the same at which they had
stopped on their first journey.

the host, on seeing a young man followed by a lackey with two extra
horses, advanced respectfully to the door. now, as they had already
traveled eleven leagues, dâ€™artagnan thought it time to stop, whether
porthos were or were not in the inn. perhaps it would not

 said dâ€™artagnan, laughing, "it appears to me that from time
to time you must make sorties." and he again pointed to the bottles and
the stewpans.

"not i, unfortunately!" said porthos. "this miserable strain confines me
to my bed; but mousqueton forages, and brings in provisions. friend
mousqueton, you see that we have a reinforcement, and we must have an
increase of supplies."

"mousqueton," said dâ€™artagnan, "you must render me a service."

"what, monsieur?"

"you must give your recipe to planchet. i may be besieged in my turn,
and i shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same
advantages with which you gratify your master."

"lord, monsieur! there is nothing more easy," said mousqueton, with a
modest air. "one only needs to be sharp, thatâ€™s all. i was brought up in
the country, and my father in his leisure time was something of a
poacher."

"and what did he do the rest of his time?"

"monsieur, he carried on a trade which i have always thought
satisfactory."

"which?

ing at amiens with four
men who accused him of being a coiner, and how he, dâ€™artagnan, had been
forced to run the comtes de wardes through the body in order to reach
england.

but there the confidence of dâ€™artagnan stopped. he only added that on
his return from great britain he had brought back four magnificent
horses--one for himself, and one for each of his companions; then he
informed porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in
the stable of the tavern.

at this moment planchet entered, to inform his master that the horses
were sufficiently refreshed and that it would be possible to sleep at
clermont.

as dâ€™artagnan was tolerably reassured with regard to porthos, and as he
was anxious to obtain news of his two other friends, he held out his
hand to the wounded man, and told him he was about to resume his route
in order to continue his researches. for the rest, as he reckoned upon
returning by the same route in seven or eight days, if porthos were
still at the great 
 
 ___________________________
 
st. martin, he would call for him on his way.

porthos replied that in all probability his sprain would not permit him
to depart yet awhile. besides, it was necessary he should stay at
chantilly to wait for the answer from his duchess.

dâ€™artagnan wished that answer might be prompt and favorable; and having
again recommended porthos to the care of mousqueton, and paid his bill
to the host, he resumed his route with planchet, already relieved of one
of his led horses.




26 aramis and his thesis


dâ€™artagnan had said nothing to porthos of his wound or of his
procuratorâ€™s wife. our bearnais was a prudent lad, however young he
might be. consequently he had appeared to believe all that the
vainglorious musketeer had told him, convinced that no friendship will
hold out against a surprised secret. besides, we feel always a sort of
mental superiority over those whose lives we know better than they
suppose. in his pr

"my good dame," asked dâ€™artagnan, "can you tell me what has become of
one of my friends, whom we were obliged to leave here about a dozen days
ago?"

"a handsome young man, three- or four-and-twenty years old, mild,
amiable, and well made?"

"that is he--wounded in the shoulder."

"just so. well, monsieur, he is still here."

"ah, pardieu! my dear dame," said dâ€™artagnan, springing from his horse,
and throwing the bridle to planchet, "you restore me to life; where is
this dear aramis? let me embrace him, i am in a hurry to see him again."

"pardon, monsieur, but i doubt whether he can see you at this moment."

"why so? has he a lady with him?"

"jesus! what do you mean by that? poor lad! no, monsieur, he has not a
lady with him."

"with whom is he, then?"

"with the curate of montdidier and the superior of the jesuits of
amiens."

"good heavens!" cried dâ€™artagnan, "is the poor fellow worse, then?"

"no, monsieur, quite t

interesting the man whose eyes or mouth, even in the most complete
intoxication, had never revealed anything, however skillfully questions
had been put to him.

"well," thought dâ€™artagnan, "poor athos is perhaps at this moment dead,
and dead by my fault--for it was i who dragged him into this affair, of
which he did not know the origin, of which he is ignorant of the result,
and from which he can derive no advantage."

"without reckoning, monsieur," added planchet to his masterâ€™s audibly
expressed reflections, "that we perhaps owe our lives to him. do you
remember how he cried, â€™on, dâ€™artagnan, on, i am takenâ€™? and when he had
discharged his two pistols, what a terrible noise he made with his
sword! one might have said that twenty men, or rather twenty mad devils,
were fighting."

these words redoubled the eagerness of dâ€™artagnan, who urged his horse,
though he stood in need of no incitement, and they proceeded at a rapid
pace. about eleven oâ€

o the host, who advanced to greet him.

"i have not that honor, monseigneur," replied the latter, his eyes
dazzled by the brilliant style in which dâ€™artagnan traveled.

"what, you donâ€™t know me?"

"no, monseigneur."

"well, two words will refresh your memory. what have you done with that
gentleman against whom you had the audacity, about twelve days ago, to
make an accusation of passing false money?"

the host became as pale as death; for dâ€™artagnan had assumed a
threatening attitude, and planchet modeled himself after his master.

"ah, monseigneur, do not mention it!" cried the host, in the most
pitiable voice imaginable. "ah, monseigneur, how dearly have i paid for
that fault, unhappy wretch as i am!"

"that gentleman, i say, what has become of him?"

"deign to listen to me, monseigneur, and be merciful! sit down, in
mercy!"

dâ€™artagnan, mute with anger and anxiety, took a seat in the threatening
attitude of a judge. planchet glared fiercely over the back of his
armchair.

"here is t

 host; "here are two english
gentlemen just arrived."

"well?"

"well, the english like good wine, as you may know, monsieur; these have
asked for the best. my wife has perhaps requested permission of monsieur
athos to go into the cellar to satisfy these gentlemen; and he, as
usual, has refused. ah, good heaven! there is the hullabaloo louder than
ever!"

dâ€™artagnan, in fact, heard a great noise on the side next the cellar. he
rose, and preceded by the host wringing his hands, and followed by
planchet with his musketoon ready for use, he approached the scene of
action.

the two gentlemen were exasperated; they had had a long ride, and were
dying with hunger and thirst.

"but this is tyranny!" cried one of them, in very good french, though
with a foreign accent, "that this madman will not allow these good
people access to their own wine! nonsense, let us break open the door,
and if he is too far gone in his madness, well, we will kill him!"

"softly, gentlemen!" said dâ€™artagnan, drawing his

brave as they appeared to be, the two english gentlemen looked at each
other hesitatingly. one might have thought there was in that cellar one
of those famished ogres--the gigantic heroes of popular legends, into
whose cavern nobody could force their way with impunity.

there was a moment of silence; but at length the two englishmen felt
ashamed to draw back, and the angrier one descended the five or six
steps which led to the cellar, and gave a kick against the door enough
to split a wall.

"planchet," said dâ€™artagnan, cocking his pistols, "i will take charge of
the one at the top; you look to the one below. ah, gentlemen, you want
battle; and you shall have it."

"good god!" cried the hollow voice of athos, "i can hear dâ€™artagnan, i
think."

"yes," cried dâ€™artagnan, raising his voice in turn, "i am here, my
friend."

"ah, good, then," replied athos, "we will teach them, these door
breakers!"

the gentlemen had drawn their swords, but they found themselves taken
between two fires. the

rink; i give you my word."

"if there is any left," grumbled the jeering voice of athos.

the host felt a cold sweat creep down his back.

"how! â€™if there is any left!â€™" murmured he.

"what the devil! there must be plenty left," replied dâ€™artagnan. "be
satisfied of that; these two cannot have drunk all the cellar.
gentlemen, return your swords to their scabbards."

"well, provided you replace your pistols in your belt."

"willingly."

and dâ€™artagnan set the example. then, turning toward planchet, he made
him a sign to uncock his musketoon.

the englishmen, convinced of these peaceful proceedings, sheathed their
swords grumblingly. the history of athosâ€™s imprisonment was then related
to them; and as they were really gentlemen, they pronounced the host in
the wrong.

"now, gentlemen," said dâ€™artagnan, "go up to your room again; and in ten
minutes, i will answer for it, you shall have all you desire."

the englishmen bowed and went upstairs.

"now i am alone, my dear athos," said dâ€™

horse."

"but he will not wish for only one harness."

"stake both, pardieu! i am not selfish, as you are."

"you would do so?" said dâ€™artagnan, undecided, so strongly did the
confidence of athos begin to prevail, in spite of himself.

"on my honor, in one single throw."

"but having lost the horses, i am particularly anxious to preserve the
harnesses."

"stake your diamond, then."

"this? thatâ€™s another matter. never, never!"

"the devil!" said athos. "i would propose to you to stake planchet, but
as that has already been done, the englishman would not, perhaps, be
willing."

"decidedly, my dear athos," said dâ€™artagnan, "i should like better not
to risk anything."

"thatâ€™s a pity," said athos, coolly. "the englishman is overflowing with
pistoles. good lord, try one throw! one throw is soon made!"

"and if i lose?"

"you will win."

"but if i lose?"

"well, you will surrender the harnesses."

"have with you for one throw!" said dâ€™artagnan.

athos went in quest of the englishman
 
 ___________________________
 
he
hundred pistoles, my friend; take the hundred pistoles!"

dâ€™artagnan only required one reason to be satisfied. this last reason
appeared convincing. besides, he feared that by resisting longer he
should appear selfish in the eyes of athos. he acquiesced, therefore,
and chose the hundred pistoles, which the englishman paid down on the
spot.

they then determined to depart. peace with the landlord, in addition to
athosâ€™s old horse, cost six pistoles. dâ€™artagnan and athos took the nags
of planchet and grimaud, and the two lackeys started on foot, carrying
the saddles on their heads.

however ill our two friends were mounted, they were soon far in advance
of their servants, and arrived at creveccoeur. from a distance they
perceived aramis, seated in a melancholy manner at his window, looking
out, like sister anne, at the dust in the horizon.

"hola, aramis! what the devil are you doing there?" cried the two
friends.

"ah, is that you, dâ€™artagnan, and you, athos?" said the young man. "i

and athos laughed aloud.

"my dear dâ€™artagnan," said aramis, "donâ€™t be too angry with me, i beg.
necessity has no law; besides, i am the person punished, as that
rascally horsedealer has robbed me of fifty louis, at least. ah, you
fellows are good managers! you ride on our lackeyâ€™s horses, and have
your own gallant steeds led along carefully by hand, at short stages."

at the same instant a market cart, which some minutes before had
appeared upon the amiens road, pulled up at the inn, and planchet and
grimaud came out of it with the saddles on their heads. the cart was
returning empty to paris, and the two lackeys had agreed, for their
transport, to slake the wagonerâ€™s thirst along the route.

"what is this?" said aramis, on seeing them arrive. "nothing but
saddles?"

"now do you understand?" said athos.

"my friends, thatâ€™s exactly like me! i retained my harness by instinct.
hola, bazin! bring my new saddle and carry it along with those of these
gentlemen."

"and what have you done

masters, for which we will draw lots. with the four hundred livres we
will make the half of one for one of the unmounted, and then we will
give the turnings out of our pockets to dâ€™artagnan, who has a steady
hand, and will go and play in the first gaming house we come to. there!"

"let us dine, then," said porthos; "it is getting cold."

the friends, at ease with regard to the future, did honor to the repast,
the remains of which were abandoned to mousqueton, bazin, planchet, and
grimaud.

on arriving in paris, dâ€™artagnan found a letter from m. de treville,
which informed him that, at his request, the king had promised that he
should enter the company of the musketeers.

as this was the height of dâ€™artagnanâ€™s worldly ambition--apart, be it
well understood, from his desire of finding mme. bonacieux--he ran, full
of joy, to seek his comrades, whom he had left only half an hour before,
but whom he found very sad and deeply preoccupied. they were assembled
in cou

xpense of an outfit."

porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him, tossing his
head and repeating, "i shall follow up on my idea."

aramis, anxious and negligently dressed, said nothing.

it may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in
the community.

the lackeys on their part, like the coursers of hippolytus, shared the
sadness of their masters. mousqueton collected a store of crusts; bazin,
who had always been inclined to devotion, never quit the churches;
planchet watched the flight of flies; and grimaud, whom the general
distress could not induce to break the silence imposed by his master,
heaved sighs enough to soften the stones.

the three friends--for, as we have said, athos had sworn not to stir a
foot to equip himself--went out early in the morning, and returned late
at night. they wandered about the streets, looking at the pavement as if
to see whether the passengers had not left a purse behind them. they
might have been supposed to be following t

30 dâ€™artagnan and the englishman


dâ€™artagnan followed milady without being perceived by her. he saw her
get into her carriage, and heard her order the coachman to drive to st.
germain.

it was useless to try to keep pace on foot with a carriage drawn by two
powerful horses. dâ€™artagnan therefore returned to the rue ferou.

in the rue de seine he met planchet, who had stopped before the house of
a pastry cook, and was contemplating with ecstasy a cake of the most
appetizing appearance.

he ordered him to go and saddle two horses in m. de trevilleâ€™s
stables--one for himself, dâ€™artagnan, and one for planchet--and bring
them to athosâ€™s place. once for all, treville had placed his stable at
dâ€™artagnanâ€™s service.

planchet proceeded toward the rue du colombier, and dâ€™artagnan toward
the rue ferou. athos was at home, emptying sadly a bottle of

fe, and how their comrade was probably by
that time in a fair way to be equipped.

"as for me," replied athos to this recital, "i am quite at my ease; it
will not be women that will defray the expense of my outfit."

"handsome, well-bred, noble lord as you are, my dear athos, neither
princesses nor queens would be secure from your amorous solicitations."

"how young this dâ€™artagnan is!" said athos, shrugging his shoulders; and
he made a sign to grimaud to bring another bottle.

at that moment planchet put his head modestly in at the half-open door,
and told his master that the horses were ready.

"what horses?" asked athos.

"two horses that monsieur de treville lends me at my pleasure, and with
which i am now going to take a ride to st. germain."

"well, and what are you going to do at st. germain?" then demanded
athos.

then dâ€™artagnan described the meeting which he had at the church, and
how he had found that lady who, with the seigneur in the black cloak and
with the scar near his temp

f you were under arrest, get on horseback and come and take a ride
with me to st. germain."

"my dear fellow," said athos, "i ride horses when i have any; when i
have none, i go afoot."

"well," said dâ€™artagnan, smiling at the misanthropy of athos, which from
any other person would have offended him, "i ride what i can get; i am
not so proud as you. so au revoir, dear athos."

"au revoir," said the musketeer, making a sign to grimaud to uncork the
bottle he had just brought.

dâ€™artagnan and planchet mounted, and took the road to st. germain.

all along the road, what athos had said respecting mme. bonacieux
recurred to the mind of the young man. although dâ€™artagnan was not of a
very sentimental character, the mercerâ€™s pretty wife had made a real
impression upon his heart. as he said, he was ready to go to the end of
the world to seek her; but the world, being round, has many ends, so
that he did not know which way to turn. meantime, he was going to try to
find out milady. milady had sp

 arrived at st.
germain. he had just passed by the pavilion in which ten years later
louis xiv was born. he rode up a very quiet street, looking to the right
and the left to see if he could catch any vestige of his beautiful
englishwoman, when from the ground floor of a pretty house, which,
according to the fashion of the time, had no window toward the street,
he saw a face peep out with which he thought he was acquainted. this
person walked along the terrace, which was ornamented with flowers.
planchet recognized him first.

"eh, monsieur!" said he, addressing dâ€™artagnan, "donâ€™t you remember that
face which is blinking yonder?"

"no," said dâ€™artagnan, "and yet i am certain it is not the first time i
have seen that visage."

"parbleu, i believe it is not," said planchet. "why, it is poor lubin,
the lackey of the comte de wardes--he whom you took such good care of a
month ago at calais, on the road to the governorâ€™s country house!"

"so it is!" said dâ€™artagnan; "i know him now. do you
 
 ___________________________
 
 think he would
recollect you?"

"my faith, monsieur, he was in such trouble that i doubt if he can have
retained a very clear recollection of me."

"well, go and talk with the boy," said dâ€™artagnan, "and make out if you
can from his conversation whether his master is dead."

planchet dismounted and went straight up to lubin, who did not at all
remember him, and the two lackeys began to chat with the best
understanding possible; while dâ€™artagnan turned the two horses into a
lane, went round the house, and came back to watch the conference from
behind a hedge of filberts.

at the end of an instantâ€™s observation he heard the noise of a vehicle,
and saw miladyâ€™s carriage stop opposite to him. he could not be
mistaken; milady was in it. dâ€™artagnan leaned upon the neck of
 
 ___________________________
 
blond head out at the window, and gave her
orders to her maid.

the latter--a pretty girl of about twenty or twenty-two years, active
and lively, the true soubrette of a great lady--jumped from the step
upon which, according to the custom of the time, she was seated, and
took her way toward the terrace upon which dâ€™artagnan had perceived
lubin.

dâ€™artagnan followed the soubrette with his eyes, and saw her go toward
the terrace; but it happened that someone in the house called lubin, so
that planchet remained alone, looking in all directions for the road
where dâ€™artagnan had disappeared.

the maid approached planchet, whom she took for lubin, and holding out a
little billet to him said, "for your master."

"for my master?" replied planchet, astonished.

"yes, and important. take it quickly."

thereupon she ran toward the carriage, which had turned round toward the
way it came, jumped upon the step, and the carriage drove off.

planchet turned and returned the billet. then, accustomed to p

assive
obedience, he jumped down from the terrace, ran toward the lane, and at
the end of twenty paces met dâ€™artagnan, who, having seen all, was coming
to him.

"for you, monsieur," said planchet, presenting the billet to the young
man.

"for me?" said dâ€™artagnan; "are you sure of that?"

"pardieu, monsieur, i canâ€™t be more sure. the soubrette said, â€™for your
master.â€™ i have no other master but you; so--a pretty little lass, my
faith, is that soubrette!"

dâ€™artagnan opened the letter, and read these words:

"a person who takes more interest in you than she is willing to confess
wishes to know on what day it will suit you to walk in the forest?
tomorrow, at the hotel field of t

he cloth of gold, a lackey in black and
red will wait for your reply."

"oh!" said dâ€™artagnan, "this is rather warm; it appears that milady and
i are anxious about the health of the same person. well, planchet, how
is the good monsieur de wardes? he is not dead, then?"

"no, monsieur, he is as well as a man can be with four sword wounds in
his body; for you, without question, inflicted four upon the dear
gentleman, and he is still very weak, having lost almost all his blood.
as i said, monsieur, lubin did not know me, and told me our adventure
from one end to the other."

"well done, planchet! you are the king of lackeys. now jump onto your
horse, and let us overtake the carriage."

this did not take

 give the money to the lackeys, as lord
de winter desired us to do."

"yes," said athos; "let us give the money to the lackeys--not to our
lackeys, but to the lackeys of the englishmen."

athos took the purse, and threw it into the hand of the coachman. "for
you and your comrades."

this greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even
porthos; and this french generosity, repeated by lord de winter and his
friend, was highly applauded, except by mm grimaud, bazin, mousqueton
and planchet.

lord de winter, on quitting dâ€™artagnan, gave him his sisterâ€™s address.
she lived in the place royale--then the fashionable quarter--at number
6, and he undertook to call and take dâ€™artagnan with him in order to
introduce him. dâ€™artagnan appointed eight oâ€™clock at athosâ€™s residence.

this introduction to milady clarik occupied the head of our gascon
greatly. he remembered in what a strange manner this woman had hitherto
been mixed up in his destiny. according to his conviction, she

assed through the
hands of usurers."

athos smiled.

"you are a capital companion, dâ€™artagnan," said be; "your never-failing
cheerfulness raises poor souls in affliction. well, let us pledge the
ring, but upon one condition."

"what?"

"that there shall be five hundred crowns for you, and five hundred
crowns for me."

"donâ€™t dream it, athos. i donâ€™t need the quarter of such a sum--i who am
still only in the guards--and by selling my saddles, i shall procure it.
what do i want? a horse for planchet, thatâ€™s all. besides, you forget
that i have a ring likewise."

"to which you attach more value, it seems, than i do to mine; at least,
i have thought so."

"yes, for in any extreme circumstance it might not only extricate us
from some great embarrassment, but even a great danger. it is not only a
valuable diamond, but it is an enchanted talisman."

"i donâ€™t at all understand you, but i believe all you say to be true.
let us return to my ring, or rather to yours. you shall take half the
sum

 that will be advanced upon it, or i will throw it into the seine;
and i doubt, as was the case with polycrates, whether any fish will be
sufficiently complaisant to bring it back to us."

"well, i will take it, then," said dâ€™artagnan.

at this moment grimaud returned, accompanied by planchet; the latter,
anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him,
had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments himself.

d'artagnan dressed himself, and athos did the same. when the two were
ready to go out, the latter made grimaud the sign of a man taking aim,
and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon, and prepared to
follow his master.

they arrived without accident at the rue des fossoyeurs. bonacieux was
standing at the door, and looked at dâ€™a

"poor dear girl! but what can i do with you? i am going away the day
after tomorrow."

"do what you please, monsieur chevalier. help me out of paris; help me
out of france!"

"i cannot take you, however, to the siege of la rochelle," aid
dâ€™artagnan.

"no; but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of your
acquaintance--in your own country, for instance."

"my dear little love! in my country the ladies do without chambermaids.
but stop! i can manage your business for you. planchet, go and find
aramis. request him to come here directly. we have something very
important to say to him."

"i understand," said athos; "but why not porthos? i should have thought
that his duchess--"

"oh, porthosâ€™s duchess is dressed by her husbandâ€™s clerks," said
dâ€™artagnan, laughing. "besides, kitty would not like to live in the rue
aux ours. isnâ€™t it so, kitty?"

"i do not care where i live," said kitty, "provided i am well concealed,
and nobody knows where i am."

"meanwhile, kitty,

believe he knew you again, kitty?"

"i pulled down my hood as soon as i saw him, but perhaps it was too
late."

"go down, athos--he mistrusts you less than me--and see if he be still
at his door."

athos went down and returned immediately.

"he has gone," said he, "and the house door is shut."

"he has gone to make his report, and to say that all the pigeons are at
this moment in the dovecot."

"well, then, let us all fly," said athos, "and leave nobody here but
planchet to bring us news."

"a minute. aramis, whom we have sent for!"

"thatâ€™s true," said athos; "we must wait for aramis."

at that moment aramis entered.

the matter was all explained to him, and the friends gave him to
understand that among all his high connections he must find a place for
kitty.

aramis reflected for a minute, and then said, coloring, "will it be
really rendering you a service, dâ€™artagnan?"

"i shall be grateful to you all my life."

"very well. madame de bois-tracy asked me,

"and now, my dear girl," said dâ€™artagnan, "you know that it is not good
for any of us to be here. therefore let us separate. we shall meet again
in better days."

"and whenever we find each other, in whatever place it may be," said
kitty, "you will find me loving you as i love you today."

"dicersâ€™ oaths!" said athos, while dâ€™artagnan went to conduct kitty
downstairs.

an instant afterward the three young men separated, agreeing to meet
again at four oâ€™clock with athos, and leaving planchet to guard the
house.

aramis returned home, and athos and dâ€™artagnan busied themselves about
pledging the sapphire.

as the gascon had foreseen, they easily obtained three hundred pistoles
on the ring. still further, the jew told them that if they would sell it
to him, as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings, he would
give five hundred pistoles for it.

athos and dâ€™artagnan, with the activity of two soldiers and the
knowledge of two connoisseurs, hardly required three hours to pu

 his
musketoon."

a half hour afterward, dâ€™artagnan returned with the two thousand livres,
and without having met with any accident.

it was thus athos found at home resources which he did not expect.




39 a vision


at four oâ€™clock the four friends were all assembled with athos. their
anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared, and each countenance
only preserved the expression of its own secret disquiet--for behind all
present happiness is concealed a fear for the future.

suddenly planchet entered, bringing two letters for dâ€™artagnan.

the one was a little billet, genteelly folded, with a pretty seal in
green wax on which was impressed a dove bearing a green branch.

the other was a large square epistle, resplendent with the terrible arms
of his eminence the cardinal duke.

at the sight of the little letter the heart of dâ€™artagnan bounded, for
he believed he recognized the handwriting, and although he had seen that
writing but once, the memory of it remained at the bottom of

holding by the halter a vigorous mecklenburg horse; this was
dâ€™artagnanâ€™s mount.

the two musketeers met at the gate. athos and dâ€™artagnan watched their
approach from the window.

"the devil!" cried aramis, "you have a magnificent horse there,
porthos."

"yes," replied porthos, "it is the one that ought to have been sent to
me at first. a bad joke of the husbandâ€™s substituted the other; but the
husband has been punished since, and i have obtained full satisfaction."

planchet and grimaud appeared in their turn, leading their mastersâ€™
steeds. dâ€™artagnan and athos put themselves into saddle with their
companions, and all four set forward; athos upon a horse he owed to a
woman, aramis on a horse he owed to his mistress, porthos on a horse he
owed to his procuratorâ€™s wife, and dâ€™artagnan on a horse he owed to his
good fortune--the best mistress possible.

the lackeys followed.

as porthos had foreseen, the cavalcade produced a good effect; and if
mme. coquenard

crossed his mind; if he made the compact with the cardinal which he
required, athos would no more give him his hand--athos would renounce
him.

it was this fear that restrained him, so powerful is the influence of a
truly great character on all that surrounds it.

dâ€™artagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered, and found
athos and the four musketeers waiting his appearance, and beginning to
grow uneasy. with a word, dâ€™artagnan reassured them; and planchet ran to
inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer, as
his master had come out safe from the palais-cardinal.

returned home with athos, aramis and porthos inquired eagerly the cause
of the strange interview; but dâ€™artagnan confined himself to telling
them that m. de richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter
into his guards with the rank of ensign, and that he had refused.

"and you were right," cried aramis and porthos, with one voice.

athos fell into a p

y than with the others, to invite them to enjoy with him
this present of delicious anjou wine which had been sent him from
villeroy.

one of the two guardsmen was engaged that evening, and another the next,
so the meeting was fixed for the day after that.

dâ€™artagnan, on his return, sent the twelve bottles of wine to the
refreshment room of the guards, with strict orders that great care
should be taken of it; and then, on the day appointed, as the dinner was
fixed for midday dâ€™artagnan sent planchet at nine in the morning to
assist in preparing everything for the entertainment.

planchet, very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord, thought
he would make all ready, like an intelligent man; and with this view
called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his masterâ€™s guests,
named fourreau, and the false soldier who had tried to kill dâ€™artagnan
and who, belonging to no corps, had entered into the service of
dâ€™artagnan, or rather of planchet, after dâ€™artagnan had saved h

is life.

the hour of the banquet being come, the two guards arrived, took their
places, and the dishes were arranged on the table. planchet waited,
towel on arm; fourreau uncorked the bottles; and brisemont, which was
the name of the convalescent, poured the wine, which was a little shaken
by its journey, carefully into decanters. of this wine, the first bottle
being a little thick at the bottom, brisemont poured the lees into a
glass, and dâ€™artagnan desired him to drink it, for the poor devil had
not yet recovered his strength.

the guests having eaten the soup, were about to lift the first glass of
wine to their lips, when all

r used thee and thou but upon
very particular occasions, "what has happened?"

"look you, my friends!" cried dâ€™artagnan, "a horrible suspicion crosses
my mind! can this be another vengeance of that woman?"

it was now athos who turned pale.

dâ€™artagnan rushed toward the refreshment room, the three musketeers and
the two guards following him.

the first object that met the eyes of dâ€™artagnan on entering the room
was brisemont, stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible
convulsions.

planchet and fourreau, as pale as death, were trying to give him succor;
but it was plain that all assistance was useless--all the features of
the dying man were distorted with agony.

"ah!" cried he, on perceiving dâ€™artagnan, "ah! this is frightful! you
pretend to pardon me, and you poison me!"

"i!" cried dâ€™artagnan. "i, wretch? what do you say?"

"i say that it was you who gave me the wine; i say that it was you who
desired me to drink it. i say you wished to avenge yourself on me, and i

ured athos, while porthos broke the bottles
and aramis gave orders, a little too late, that a confessor should be
sent for.

"oh, my friends," said dâ€™artagnan, "you come once more to save my life,
not only mine but that of these gentlemen. gentlemen," continued he,
addressing the guardsmen, "i request you will be silent with regard to
this adventure. great personages may have had a hand in what you have
seen, and if talked about, the evil would only recoil upon us."

"ah, monsieur!" stammered planchet, more dead than alive, "ah, monsieur,
what an escape i have had!"

"how, sirrah! you were going to drink my wine?"

"to the health of the king, monsieur; i was going to drink a small glass
of it if fourreau had not told me i was called."

"alas!" said fourreau, whose teeth chattered with terror, "i wanted to
get him out of the way that i might drink myself."

"gentlemen," said dâ€™artagnan, addressing the guardsmen, "you may easily
comprehend that such a feast can only be very dull after what h

the two guardsmen courteously accepted dâ€™artagnanâ€™s excuses, and
perceiving that the four friends desired to be alone, retired.

when the young guardsman and the three musketeers were without
witnesses, they looked at one another with an air which plainly
expressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their situation.

"in the first place," said athos, "let us leave this chamber; the dead
are not agreeable company, particularly when they have died a violent
death."

"planchet," said dâ€™artagnan, "i commit the corpse of this poor devil to
your care. let him be interred in holy ground. he committed a crime, it
is true; but he repented of it."

and the four friends quit the room, leaving to planchet and fourreau the
duty of paying mortuary honors to brisemont.

the host gave them another chamber, and served them with fresh eggs and
some water, which athos went himself to draw at the fountain. in a few
words, porthos and aramis were posted as to the situation.

"well,"

 the three friends with an
inclination of his head, and took the right hand, followed by his
attendant--for that night he himself slept in the camp.

"well!" said porthos and aramis together, as soon as the cardinal was
out of hearing, "well, he signed the paper she required!"

"i know it," said athos, coolly, "since here it is."

and the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached
their quarters, except to give the watchword to the sentinels. only they
sent mousqueton to tell planchet that his master was requested, the
instant that he left the trenches, to come to the quarters of the
musketeers.

milady, as athos had foreseen, on finding the two men that awaited her,
made no difficulty in following them. she had had for an instant an
inclination to be reconducted to the cardinal, and relate everything to
him; but a revelation on her part would bring about a revelation on the
part of athos. she might say that athos had hanged her; but then athos
would tell that she was brande

one of these, and we shall be in peace."

"yes," said dâ€™artagnan, "till she comes out."

"ah, my faith!" said athos, "you require too much, dâ€™artagnan. i have
given you all i have, and i beg leave to tell you that this is the
bottom of my sack."

"but i think it would be still better," said aramis, "to inform the
queen and lord de winter at the same time."

"yes; but who is to carry the letter to tours, and who to london?"

"i answer for bazin," said aramis.

"and i for planchet," said dâ€™artagnan.

"ay," said porthos, "if we cannot leave the camp, our lackeys may."

"to be sure they may; and this very day we will write the letters," said
aramis. "give the lackeys money, and they will start."

"we will give them money?" replied athos. "have you any money?"

the four friends looked at one another, and a cloud came over the brows
which but lately had been so cheerful.

"look out!" cried dâ€™artagnan, "i see black points and red points moving
yonder. why did you talk of

should be the lackeys to carry the letters.

everyone offered his own. athos talked of the discretion of grimaud, who
never spoke a word but when his master unlocked his mouth. porthos
boasted of the strength of mousqueton, who was big enough to thrash four
men of ordinary size. aramis, confiding in the address of bazin, made a
pompous eulogium on his candidate. finally, dâ€™artagnan had entire faith
in the bravery of planchet, and reminded them of the manner in which he
had conducted himself in the ticklish affair of boulogne.

these four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time, and gave
birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they
should be deemed too long.

"unfortunately," said athos, "he whom we send must possess in himself
alone the four qualities united."

"but where is such a lackey to be found?"

"not to be found!" cried athos. "i know it well, so take grimaud."

"take mous

queton."

"take bazin."

"take planchet. planchet is brave and shrewd; they are two qualities out
of the four."

"gentlemen," said aramis, "the principal question is not to know which
of our four lackeys is the most discreet, the most strong, the most
clever, or the most brave; the principal thing is to know which loves
money the best."

"what aramis says is very sensible," replied athos; "we must speculate
upon the faults of people, and not upon their virtues. monsieur abbe,
you are a great moralist."

"doubtless," said aramis, "for we not on

ly require to be well served in
order to succeed, but moreover, not to fail; for in case of failure,
heads are in question, not for our lackeys--"

"speak lower, aramis," said athos.

"thatâ€™s wise--not for the lackeys," resumed aramis, "but for the
master--for the masters, we may say. are our lackeys sufficiently
devoted to us to risk their lives for us? no."

"my faith," said dâ€™artagnan. "i would almost answer for planchet."

"well, my dear friend, add to his natural devotedness a good sum of
money, and then, instead of answering for him once, answer for him
twice."

"why, good god! you will be deceived just the same," said athos, who was
an optimist when things were concerned, and a pessimist when men were in
question. "they will promise everything for the sake of the money, and
on the road fear will prevent them from acting. once taken, they will be
pressed; when pressed, they will confess everything. what the

gentlemen, he knows that sixtus the fifth became pope after having kept
pigs. well, as he means to enter the church at the same time as myself,
he does not despair of becoming pope in his turn, or at least a
cardinal. you can understand that a man who has such views will never
allow himself to be taken, or if taken, will undergo martyrdom rather
than speak."

"very well," said dâ€™artagnan, "i consent to bazin with all my heart, but
grant me planchet. milady had him one day turned out of doors, with
sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions. now, planchet
has an excellent memory; and i will be bound that sooner than relinquish
any possible means of vengeance, he will allow himself to be beaten to
death. if your arrangements at tours are your arrangements, aramis,
those of london are mine. i request, then, that planchet may be chosen,
more particularly as he has already been to london with me, and knows
how to speak correctly: l

ondon, sir, if you please, and my master, lord
dâ€™artagnan. with that you may be satisfied he can make his way, both
going and returning."

"in that case," said athos, "planchet must receive seven hundred livres
for going, and seven hundred livres for coming back; and bazin, three
hundred livres for going, and three hundred livres for returning--that
will reduce the sum to five thousand livres. we will each take a
thousand livres to be employed as seems good, and we will leave a fund
of a thousand livres under the guardianship of monsieur abbe here, for
extraordinary occasions or common wants. will that do?"

"my dear athos," said aramis, "you speak like nestor, who wa

s, as
everyone knows, the wisest among the greeks."

"well, then," said athos, "it is agreed. planchet and bazin shall go.
everything considered, i am not sorry to retain grimaud; he is
accustomed to my ways, and i am particular. yesterdayâ€™s affair must have
shaken him a little; his voyage would upset him quite."

planchet was sent for, and instructions were given him. the matter had
been named to him by dâ€™artagnan, who in the first place pointed out the
money to him, then the glory, and then the danger.

"i will carry the letter in the lining of my coat," said planchet; "and
if i am taken i will swallow it."

"well, but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission," said
dâ€™artagnan.

"you will give me a copy this evening, which i shall know by heart
tomorrow."

dâ€™artagnan looked at his friends, as

if to say, "well, what did i tell
you?"

"now," continued he, addressing planchet, "you have eight days to get an
interview with lord de winter; you have eight days to return--in all
sixteen days. if, on the sixteenth day after your departure, at eight
oâ€™clock in the evening you are not here, no money--even if it be but
five minutes past eight."

"then, monsieur," said planchet, "you must buy me a watch."

"take this," said athos, with his usual careless generosity, giving him
his own, "and be a good lad. remember, if you talk, if you babble, if
you get drunk, you risk your masterâ€™s head, who has so much confidence
in your fidelity, and who answers for you. but remember, also, that if
by your fault any evil happens to dâ€™artagnan, i will find you, wherever
you may be, for the purpose of ripping up your belly."

"oh, monsieur!" said planchet, humiliated by the suspi

cion, and
moreover, terrified at the calm air of the musketeer.

"and i," said porthos, rolling his large eyes, "remember, i will skin
you alive."

"ah, monsieur!"

"and i," said aramis, with his soft, melodius voice, "remember that i
will roast you at a slow fire, like a savage."

"ah, monsieur!"

planchet began to weep. we will not venture to say whether it was from
terror created by the threats or from tenderness at seeing four friends
so closely united.

dâ€™artagnan took his hand. "see, planchet," said he, "these gentlemen
only say this out of affection for me, but at bottom they all like you."

"ah, monsieur," said planchet, "i will succeed or i will consent to be
cut in quarters; and if they do cut me in quarters, be assured that not
a morsel of me will speak."

it was decided that planchet should set out the next day, at eight
oâ€™clock in the morning, in order, as he had said, that he might during
the night learn the letter by heart. he gained just twelve hours by this
engagement; 
 
 ___________________________
 
he was to be back on the sixteenth day, by eight oâ€™clock in
the evening.

in the morning, as he was mounting his horse, dâ€™artagnan, who felt at
the bottom of his heart a partiality for the duke, took planchet aside.

"listen," said he to him. "when you have given the letter to lord de
winter and he has read it, you will further say to him: watch over his
grace lord buckingham, for they wish to assassinate him. but this,
planchet, is so serious and important that i have not informed my
friends that i would entrust this secret to you; and for a captainâ€™s
commission i would not write it."

"be satisfied, monsieur," said planchet, "you shall see if confidence
can be placed in me."

mounted on an excellent horse, which he was to leave at the end of
twenty leagues in order to take the post, planchet set off at a gallop,
his spirits a little depressed by the triple promise made him by the
musketeers, but otherwise as light-

by his fortunate return, removed
more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends.
the days of expectation are long, and dâ€™artagnan, in particular, would
have wagered that the days were forty-four hours. he forgot the
necessary slowness of navigation; he exaggerated to himself the power of
milady. he credited this woman, who appeared to him the equal of a
demon, with agents as supernatural as herself; at the least noise, he
imagined himself about to be arrested, and that planchet was being
brought back to be confronted with himself and his friends. still
further, his confidence in the worthy picard, at one time so great,
diminished day by day. this anxiety became so great that it even
extended to aramis and porthos. athos alone remained unmoved, as if no
danger hovered over him, and as if he breathed his customary atmosphere.

on the sixteenth day, in particular, these signs were so strong in
dâ€™artagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one
place

, and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which planchet was
expected.

"really," said athos to them, "you are not men but children, to let a
woman terrify you so! and what does it amount to, after all? to be
imprisoned. well, but we should be taken out of prison; madame bonacieux
was released. to be decapitated? why, every day in the trenches we go
cheerfully to expose ourselves to worse than that--for a bullet may
break a leg, and i am convinced a surgeon would give us more pain in
cutting off a thigh than an executioner in cutting off a head. wait

quietly, then; in two hours, in four, in six hours at latest, planchet
will be here. he promised to be here, and i have very great faith in
planchet, who appears to me to be a very good lad."

"but if he does not come?" said dâ€™artagnan.

"well, if he does not come, it will be because he has been delayed,
thatâ€™s all. he may have fallen from his horse, he may have cut a caper
from the deck; he may have traveled so fast against the wind as to have
brought on a violent catarrh. eh, gentlemen, let us reckon upon
accidents! life is a chaplet of little miseries which the philosopher
counts with a smile. be philosophers, as i am, gentlemen; sit

ntlemen," said he, "they are beating the tattoo. let us to bed!"

and athos went out of the parpaillot, followed by dâ€™artagnan. aramis
came behind, giving his arm to porthos. aramis mumbled verses to
himself, and porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his
mustache, in sign of despair.

but all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which
was familiar to dâ€™artagnan, and a well-known voice said, "monsieur, i
have brought your cloak; it is chilly this evening."

"planchet!" cried dâ€™artagnan, beside himself with joy.

"planchet!" repeated aramis and porthos.

"well, yes, planchet, to be sure," said athos, "what is there so
astonishing in that? he promised to be back by eight oâ€™clock, and eight
is striking. bravo, planchet, you are a lad of your word, and if ever
you leave your master, i will promise you a place in my service."

"oh, no, never," said planchet, "i will never leave monsieur
dâ€™artagnan."

at the same time dâ€™artagnan felt that planchet slipped
 
 ___________________________
 
 a note into his
hand.

dâ€™artagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace planchet as he had
embraced him on his departure; but he feared lest this mark of
affection, bestowed upon his lackey in the open street, might appear
extraordinary to passers-by, and he restrained himself.

"i have the note," said he to athos and to his friends.

"thatâ€™s well," said athos, "let us go home and read it."

the note burned the hand of dâ€™artagnan. he wished to hasten their steps;
but athos took his arm and passed it under his own, and the young man
was forced to regulate his pace by tha

t of his friend.

at length they reached the tent, lit a lamp, and while planchet stood at
the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised, dâ€™artagnan,
with a trembling hand, broke the seal and opened the so anxiously
expected letter.

it contained half a line, in a hand perfectly british, and with a
conciseness as perfectly spartan:

thank you; be easy.

dâ€™artagnan translated this for the others.

athos took the letter from the hands of dâ€™artagnan, approached the lamp,
set fire to the paper, and did not let go till it was reduced to a
cinder.

then, calling

planchet, he said, "now, my lad, you may claim your seven
hundred livres, but you did not run much risk with such a note as that."

"i am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it," said
planchet.

"well!" cried dâ€™artagnan, "tell us all about it."

"dame, thatâ€™s a long job, monsieur."

"you are right, planchet," said athos; "besides, the tattoo has been
sounded, and we should be observed if we kept a light burning much
longer than the others."

"so be it," said dâ€™artagnan. "go to bed, planchet, and sleep soundly."

"my faith, monsieur! that will be the first time i have done so for
sixteen days."

"and me, too!" said dâ€™artagnan.

"and me, too!" said porthos.

"and me, too!" said aramis.

"well, if you will have the truth, and me, too!" said athos.

hirteen days, during which so many
important events might pass in london. she reflected likewise that the
cardinal would be furious at her return, and consequently would be more
disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the
accusations she brought against others.

she allowed the vessel to pass lorient and brest without repeating her
request to the captain, who, on his part, took care not to remind her of
it. milady therefore continued her voyage, and on the very day that
planchet embarked at portsmouth for france, the messenger of his
eminence entered the port in triumph.

all the city was agitated by an extraordinary movement. four large
vessels, recently built, had just been launched. at the end of the
jetty, his clothes richly laced with gold, glittering, as was customary
with him, with diamonds and precious stones, his hat ornamented with a
white feather which drooped upon his shoulder, buckingham was seen
surrounded by a staff almost as brilliant as himself.

myself and planchet are all that such a simple expedition requires."

to this athos replied quietly: "we also have money left--for i have not
yet drunk all my share of the diamond, and porthos and aramis have not
eaten all theirs. we can therefore use up four horses as well as one.
but consider, dâ€™artagnan," added he, in a tone so solemn that it made
the young man shudder, "consider that bethune is a city where the
cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who, wherever she goes, brings
misery with her. if you ha

had a relay, started off at a gallop, and with a fresh horse took the
road to paris. at the moment he passed through the gateway into the
street, the wind blew open the cloak in which he was wrapped, although
it was in the month of august, and lifted his hat, which the traveler
seized with his hand the moment it had left his head, pulling it eagerly
over his eyes.

dâ€™artagnan, who had his eyes fixed upon this man, became very pale, and
let his glass fall.

"what is the matter, monsieur?" said planchet. "oh, come, gentlemen, my
master is ill!"

the three friends hastened toward dâ€™artagnan, who, instead of being ill,
ran toward his horse. they stopped him at the door.

"well, where the devil are you going now?" cried athos.

"it is he!" cried dâ€™artagnan, pale with anger, and with the sweat on his
brow, "it is he! let me overtake him!"

"he? what he?" asked athos.

"he, that man!"

"what man?"

"that cursed man, my evil genius, whom i have always met with when
threatened by some misfortune,

the despair of athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only
rendered more lucid the brilliant mental faculties of that extraordinary
man.

possessed by one single thought--that of the promise he had made, and of
the responsibility he had taken--he retired last to his chamber, begged
the host to procure him a map of the province, bent over it, examined
every line traced upon it, perceived that there were four different
roads from bethune to armentieres, and summoned the lackeys.

planchet, grimaud, bazin, and mousqueton presented themselves, and
received clear, positive, and serious orders from athos.

they must set out the next morning at daybreak, and go to
armentieres--each by a different route. planchet, the most intelligent
of the four, was to follow that by which the carriage had gone upon
which the four friends had fired, and which was accompanied, as may be
remembered, by rochefortâ€™s servant.

athos set the lackeys to work first because, since these men had been in

s, dotted the road. at the end of
three-quarters of a league, within fifty paces of festubert, a larger
bloodstain appeared; the ground was trampled by horses. between the
forest and this accursed spot, a little behind the trampled ground, was
the same track of small feet as in the garden; the carriage had stopped
here. at this spot milady had come out of the wood, and entered the
carriage.

satisfied with this discovery which confirmed all his suspicions, athos
returned to the hotel, and found planchet impatiently waiting for him.

everything was as athos had foreseen.

planchet had followed the road; like athos, he had discovered the stains
of blood; like athos, he had noted the spot where the horses had halted.
but he had gone farther than athos--for at the village of festubert,
while drinking at an inn, he had learned without needing to ask a
question that the evening before, at half-past eight, a wounded man who
accompanied a lady traveling in a post-chaise had been obliged to stop,
unabl

e to go further. the accident was set down to the account of
robbers, who had stopped the chaise in the wood. the man remained in the
village; the woman had had a relay of horses, and continued her journey.

planchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her, and found
him. he had taken the lady as far as fromelles; and from fromelles she
had set out for armentieres. planchet took the crossroad, and by seven
oâ€™clock in the morning he was at armentieres.

there was but one tavern, the post. planchet went and presented himself
as a lackey out of a place, who was in search of a situation. he had not
chatted ten minutes with the people of the tavern before he learned that
a woman had come there alone about eleven oâ€™clock the night before, had
engaged a chamber, had sent for the master of the hotel, and told him
she desired to remain some time in the neighborhood.

 the horses to be saddled,
and lord de winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for
the expedition.

in an instant all five were ready. each examined his arms, and put them
in order. athos came down last, and found dâ€™artagnan already on
horseback, and growing impatient.

"patience!" cried athos; "one of our party is still wanting."

the four horsemen looked round them with astonishment, for they sought
vainly in their minds to know who this other person could be.

at this moment planchet brought out athosâ€™s horse; the musketeer leaped
lightly into the saddle.

"wait for me," cried he, "i will soon be back," and he set off at a
gallop.

in a quarter of an hour he returned, accompanied by a tall man, masked,
and wrapped in a large red cloak.

lord de winter and the three musketeers looked at one another
inquiringly. neither could give the others any information, for all were
ignorant who this man could be; nevertheless, they felt convinced that
all was as it should be, as it wa

s done by the order of athos.

at nine oâ€™clock, guided by planchet, the little cavalcade set out,
taking the route the carriage had taken.

it was a melancholy sight--that of these six men, traveling in silence,
each plunged in his own thoughts, sad as despair, gloomy as
chastisement.




65 trial


it was a stormy and dark night; vast clouds covered the heavens,
concealing the stars; the moon would not rise till midnight.

occasionally, by the light of a flash of lightning which gleamed along
the horizon, the road stretched itself before them, white and solit

ary;
the flash extinct, all remained in darkness.

every minute athos was forced to restrain dâ€™artagnan, constantly in
advance of the little troop, and to beg him to keep in the line, which
in an instant he again departed from. he had but one thought--to go
forward; and he went.

they passed in silence through the little village of festubert, where
the wounded servant was, and then skirted the wood of richebourg. at
herlier, planchet, who led the column, turned to the left.

several times lord de winter, porthos, or aramis tried to talk with the
man in the red cloak; but to every interrogation which they put to him
he bowed, without response. the travelers then comprehended that there
must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence, and ceased
to address themselves to him.

the storm increased, the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly, the
thunder began to growl, and the wind, the precursor of a hurricane
 
 ___________________________
 
like a terrible scimitar divided the heavens and the waters into two
parts. not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere. a
deathlike silence oppressed all nature. the soil was humid and
glittering with the rain which had recently fallen, and the refreshed
herbs sent forth their perfume with additional energy.

two lackeys dragged milady, whom each held by one arm. the executioner
walked behind them, and lord de winter, dâ€™artagnan, porthos, and aramis
walked behind the executioner. planchet and bazin came last.

the two lackeys conducted milady to the bank of the river. her mouth was
mute; but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence,
supplicating by turns each of those on whom she looked.

being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys, "a thousand
pistoles to each of you, if you will assist my escape; but if you
deliver me up to your masters, i have near at hand avengers who will
make you pay dearly for my death."

grimaud hesitated. mousqueton trembled in al

l his members.

athos, who heard miladyâ€™s voice, came sharply up. lord de winter did the
same.

"change these lackeys," said he; "she has spoken to them. they are no
longer sure."

planchet and bazin were called, and took the places of grimaud and
mousqueton.

on the bank of the river the executioner approached milady, and bound
her hands and feet.

then she broke the silence to cry out, "you are cowards, miserable
assassins--ten men combined to murder one woman. beware! if i am not
saved i shall be avenged."

"you are not a woman," said athos, coldly and sternly. "you do not
belong to the human species; you are a demon escaped from hell, whither
we send you back again."

"ah, you

thos.

dâ€™artagnan fought three times with rochefort, and wounded him three
times.

"i shall probably kill you the fourth," said he to him, holding out his
hand to assist him to rise.

"it is much better both for you and for me to stop where we are,"
answered the wounded man. "corbleu--i am more your friend than you
think--for after our very first encounter, i could by saying a word to
the cardinal have had your throat cut!"

they this time embraced heartily, and without retaining any malice.

planchet obtained from rochefort the rank of sergeant in the piedmont
regiment.

m bonacieux lived on very quietly, wholly ignorant of what had become of
his wife, and caring very little about it. one day he had the imprudence
to recall himself to the memory of the cardinal. the cardinal had him
informed that he would provide for him so that he should never want for
anything in future. in fact, m. bonacieux, having left his house at
seven oâ€™clock in the evening to go to the louvre, never appeared agai
