the wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they
rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in
a corner. other company were there: two playing cards, two playing
dominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply
of wine. as he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the
elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, “this is our man.”

“what the devil do _you_ do in that galley there?” said monsieur defarge
to himself; “i don’t know you.”

but, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse
with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.

“how goes it, jacques?” said one of these three to monsieur defarge. “is
all the spilt wine swallowed?”

“every drop, jacques,” answered monsieur defarge.

when this interchange of christian name was effected, madame defarge,
picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough

and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.

“it is not often,” said the second of the three, addressing monsieur
defarge, “that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or
of anything but black bread and death. is it not so, jacques?”

“it is so, jacques,” monsieur defarge returned.

at this second interchange of the christian name, madame defarge, still
using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of
cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.

the last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty
drinking vessel and smacked his lips.

“ah! so much the worse! a bitter taste it is that such poor cattle
always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, jacques. am i
right, jacques?”

“you

are right, jacques,” was the response of monsieur defarge.

this third interchange of the christian name was completed at the moment
when madame defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and
slightly rustled in her seat.

“hold then! true!” muttered her husband. “gentlemen--my wife!”

the three customers pulled off their hats to madame defarge, with three
flourishes. she acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and
giving them a quick look. then she glanced in a casual manner round the
wine-shop, took up her knitting

close to the left here,” pointing with his hand, “near to the window of
my establishment. but, now that i remember, one of you has already been
there, and can show the way. gentlemen, adieu!”

they paid for their wine, and left the place. the eyes of monsieur
defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly
gentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.

“willingly, sir,” said monsieur defarge, and quietly stepped with him to
the door.

their conference was very short, but very decided. almost at the first
word, monsieur defarge started and became deeply attentive. it had
not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. the gentleman then
beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. madame defarge
knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.

rway to which he had directed his own
company just before. it opened from a stinking little black courtyard,
and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited
by a great number of people. in the gloomy tile-paved entry to the
gloomy tile-paved staircase, monsieur defarge bent down on one knee
to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips. it was
a gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable
transformation had come over him in a few seconds. he had no good-humour
in his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret,
angry, dangerous man.

“it is very high; it is a little difficult. better to begin slowly.”
 thus, monsieur defarge, in a stern voice, to mr. lorry, as they began
ascending the stairs.

was reached. the keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in
advance, and always going on the side which mr. lorry took, as though he
dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about
here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over
his shoulder, took out a key.

“the door is locked then, my friend?” said mr. lorry, surprised.

“ay. yes,” was the grim reply of monsieur defarge.

“you think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?”

“i think it necessary to turn the key.” monsieur defarge whispered it
closer in his ear, and frowned heavily.

“why?”

“why! because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be
frightened--rave--tear himself to pieces--die--come to i know not what
harm--if his door was left open.”

“is it possible!” exclaimed mr. lorry.

“is it possible!” repeated defarge, bitterly. “yes. and

alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work
requiring nicety in such obscurity. yet, work of that kind was being
done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face
towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at
him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very
busy, making shoes.

bent low over the shoemaking.

salutation, as if it were at a distance:

“good day!”

“you are still hard at work, i see?”

after a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the
voice replied, “yes--i am working.” this time, a pair of haggard eyes
had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.

rward, leaving the daughter by the door. when
he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of defarge, the shoemaker
looked up. he showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the
unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at
it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then
the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe. the
look and the action had occupied but an instant.

“you have a visitor, you see,” said monsieur defarge.

“what did you say?”

“here is a visitor.”

the shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand from his
work.

“come!” said defarge. “here is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when
he sees one. show him that shoe you are working at. take it, monsieur.”

mr. lorry took it in his hand.

“tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker’s name.”

there was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:

for the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily
dividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away
to do it.

then, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her head down on the
hard ground close at the father’s side, and watched him. the darkness
deepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light gleamed
through the chinks in the wall.

mr. lorry and monsieur defarge had made all ready for the journey, and
had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and
meat, wine, and hot coffee. monsieur defarge put this provender, and the
lamp he carried, on the shoemaker’s bench (there was nothing else in the
garret but a pallet bed), and he and mr. lorry roused the captive, and
assisted him to his feet.

daughter’s voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.

in the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he
ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink, and put on the cloak
and other wrappings, that they gave him to wear. he readily responded to
his daughter’s drawing her arm through his, and took--and kept--her hand
in both his own.

they began to descend; monsieur defarge going first with the lamp, mr.
lorry closing the little procession. they had not traversed many steps
of the long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at the roof and
round at the walls.

“you remember the place, my father? you remember coming up here?”

“what did you say?”

she had repeated it.

there had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of monsieur
defarge. as early as six o’clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping
through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over
measures of wine. monsieur defarge sold a very thin wine at the best
of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that
he sold at this time. a sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its
influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. no
vivacious bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of monsieur
defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in
the dregs of it.

this had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been
early drinking

at the wine-shop of monsieur defarge. it had begun
on monday, and here was wednesday come. there had been more of early
brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and
slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could
not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. these
were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could
have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat,
and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of

gaol. games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built
towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops
of wine, madame defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve
with her toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible
a long way off.

thus, saint antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday. it was
high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under
his swinging lamps: of whom, one was monsieur defarge: the other a
mender of roads in a blue cap. all adust and athirst, the two entered
the wine-shop. their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast
of saint antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and
flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows. yet, no one had
followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though
the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.

“good day, gentlemen!” said monsieur defarge.

man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at
him through the chinks in the wall.

defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice:

“jacques one, jacques two, jacques three! this is the witness
encountered by appointment, by me, jacques four. he will tell you all.
speak, jacques five!”

the mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with
it, and said, “where shall i commence, monsieur?”

“commence,” was monsieur defarge’s not unreasonable reply, “at the
commencement.”

“i saw him then, messieurs,” began the mender of roads, “a year ago this
running summer, underneath the carriage of the marquis, hanging by the
chain. behold the manner of it. i leaving my work on the road, the sun
going to bed, the carriage of the marquis slowly ascending the hill, he
hanging by the chain--like this.”

again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which
he ought to have been perfect by

the defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight,
in their public vehicle, to that gate of paris whereunto their
journey naturally tended. there was the usual stoppage at the barrier
guardhouse, and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual
examination and inquiry. monsieur defarge alighted; knowing one or two
of the soldiery there, and one of the police. the latter he was intimate
with, and affectionately embraced.

when saint antoine had again enfolded the defarges in his dusky wings,
and they, having finally alighted near the saint’s boundaries, were
picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his
streets, madame defarge spoke to her husband:

“say then, my friend; what did jacques of the police tell thee?”

of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her
handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the
night. all this while, defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked
up and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which
condition, indeed, as to the business and his domestic affairs, he
walked up and down through life.

the night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so foul a
neighbourhood, was ill-smelling. monsieur defarge’s olfactory sense was
by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than
it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed. he
whiffed the compound of scents away, as he put down his smoked-out pipe.

“you are fatigued,” said madame, raising her glance as she knotted the
money. “there are only the usual odours.”

“i am a little tired,” her husband acknowledged.

“you are a little depressed, too,” said madame, whose quick eyes had

ude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh
water, and asked for another glass of cognac. madame defarge poured it
out for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over
it.

“you seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than i do?”
 observed defarge.

“not at all, but i hope to know it better. i am so profoundly interested
in its miserable inhabitants.”

“hah!” muttered defarge.

“the pleasure of conversing with you, monsieur defarge, recalls to me,”
 pursued the spy, “that i have the honour of cherishing some interesting
associations with your name.”

“indeed!” said defarge, with much indifference.

“yes, indeed. when doctor manette was released, you, his old domestic,
had the charge of him, i know. he was delivered to you. you see i am
informed of the circumstances?”

“such is the fact, certainly,” said defarge. he had had it conveyed
to him, in an accidental touch of his wife’s elbow as she

t suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of
most other sauce to wretched bread. yet, human fellowship infused
some nourishment into the flinty viands, and struck some sparks of
cheerfulness out of them. fathers and mothers who had had their full
share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children;
and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and
hoped.

it was almost morning, when defarge’s wine-shop parted with its last
knot of customers, and monsieur defarge said to madame his wife, in
husky tones, while fastening the door:

“at last it is come, my dear!”

“eh well!” returned madame. “almost.”

saint antoine slept, the defarges slept: even the vengeance slept with
her starved grocer, and the drum was at rest. the drum’s was the
only voice in saint antoine that blood and hurry had not changed. the
vengeance, as custodian of the drum, could have wakened him up and had
the same speech out of him as before the bastille fell, or
