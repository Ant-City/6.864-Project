it was almost december, and jonas was beginning to be
frightened. no. wrong word, jonas thought. frightened meant that
deep, sickening feeling of something terrible about to happen.
frightened was the way he had felt a year ago when an unidentified



aircraft had overflown the community twice. he had seen it both
times. squinting toward the sky, he had seen the sleek jet, almost a
blur at its high speed, go past, and a second later heard the blast of
sound that followed. then o

the old man nodded to him. he looked drained, and a little sad.

"sir?" jonas said shyly.

"yes? do you have a question?"

"it's just that i don't know your name. i thought you were the
receiver, but you say that now i'm the receiver. so i don't know





what to call you."

the man had sat back down in the comfortable upholstered chair.
he moved his shoulders around as if to ease away an aching
sensation. he seemed terribly weary.

"call me the giver," he told jonas.

"you slept soundly, jonas?" his mother asked at the morning meal.
"no dreams?"

jonas simply smiled and nodded, not ready to lie, not willing to tell
the truth. "i slept very soundly," he said.

"i wish this one would," his father said, leaning down from his chair
to touch gabriel's waving fist. the basket was on the floor beside
him; in its corner, beside gabriel's head, the smiled hippo sat
staring with its blank eyes.

"so do i," mother said, rolling her eyes. "

thought, trying to recreate it in his mind, it wasn't fiona in her

seemed to be just her hair. and just for that flickering instant.

he ran through it in his mind. it was clearly beginning to happen
more often. first, the apple a few weeks before. the next time had
been the faces in the audience at the auditorium, just two days
ago. now, today, fiona's hair.

frowning, jonas walked toward the annex. i will ask the giver, he
decided.

the old man looked up, smiling, when jonas entered the room. he
was already seated beside the bed, and he seemed more energetic
today, slightly renewed, and glad to see jonas.

"welcome," he said. "we must get started. you're one minute late."

"i apologi-" jonas began, and then stopped, flustered,
remembering there were to be no apologies.

he removed his tunic and went to the bed. "i'm one minute late
because something happened," he explained. "and i'd like to ask
you about it,

if you don't mind."

"you may ask me anything."




jonas tried to sort it out in his mind so that he could explain it
clearly. "i think it's what you call seeing-beyond," he said.

the giver nodded. "describe it," he said.

jonas told him about the experience with the apple. then the
moment on the stage, when he had looked out and seen the same
phenomenon in the faces of the crowd.

"then today, just now, outside, it happened with my friend fiona.
she herself didn't change, exactly. but something about her
changed for a second. her hair looked different; but not in its
shape, not in its length. i can't

describ

e exactly what had occurred.

finally he simply said, "it changed. i don't know how, or why."

"that's why i was one minute late," he concluded, and looked
questioningly at the giver.

to his surprise, the old man asked him a question which seemed
unrelated to the seeing-beyond. "when i gave you the memory
yesterday, the first one, the ride on the sled, did you look around?"

jonas nodded. "yes," he said, "but the stuff- i mean the snow-in
the air made it hard to see anything."

"did you look at the sled?"

jonas thought back. "no. i only felt it under me. i dreamed of it last
night, too. but i don't remember seeing the sled in my dream,
either. just feeling it."

"when i was observing you, before the selection, i perceived that
you probably had the capacity, and what you describe confirms
that. it happened somewhat differently to me," the giver told him.
"when i was just your age-about to become the new receiver--!
began to experience it, though it took a different form. with me it
was ... well, i won't describe that now; you wouldn't understand it
yet.

"but i think i can guess how it's happening with you. let me just
make a little test, to confirm my guess. lie down."

jonas lay on the bed again with his hands at his sides. he felt
comfortable here now. he dosed his eyes and waited for the
familiar feel of the giver's hands on his b

but it didn't come. instead, the giver instructed him, "call back the
memory of the ride on the sled. just the beginning of it, where
you're at the top of the hill, before the slide starts. and this time,
look down at the sled."

jonas was puzzled. he opened his eyes. "excuse me," he asked
politely, "but don't you have to give me the memory?"

"it's your memory, now, it's not mine to experience any longer. i
gave it away."

"but how can i call it back?"

"you can remember last year, or the year that you were a seven, or
a five, can'

saw his
own hands, furred again with snow, holding the rope. he saw his
legs, and moved them aside for a glimpse of the sled beneath.

dumbfounded, he stared at it. this time it was not a fleeting
impression. this time the sled had--and continued to have, as he
blinked, and stared at it again-that same mysterious quality that
the apple had had so briefly. and fiona's hair. the sled did not
change. it simply was-whatever the thing was.



94



jonas opened his eyes and was still on the bed. the giver was
watching him curiously.

"yes," jonas said slowly. "i saw it, in the sled."

"let me try one more thing. look over there, to the bookcase. do
you see the very top row of books, the ones behind the table, on
the top shelf?"

jonas sought them with his eyes. he stared at them, and they
changed. but the change was fleeting. it slipped away the next
instant.




"it happened," jonas said. "it happened to the books, but it went
away again."

"i'm right, then," the giver said. "you're beginning t

o see the color
red."

"the what?"

the giver sighed. "how to explain this? once, back in the time of
the memories, everything had a shape and size, the way things still
do, but they also had a quality called color.

"there were a lot of colors, and one of them was called red. that's
the one you are starting to see. your friend fiona has red hair-
quite distinctive, actually; i've noticed it before. when you
mentioned fiona's hair, it was the clue that told me you were
probably beginning to see the color red."

"and the faces of people? th
 
 ___________________________
 
e ones i saw at the ceremony?"

the giver shook his head. "no, flesh isn't red. but it has red tones
in it. there was a time, actually-you'll see this in the memories
later-when flesh was many different colors. that was before we
went to sameness. today flesh is all the same, and what you saw
was the red tones.



95



probably when you saw the faces take on color it wasn't as deep or
vibrant as the apple, or your friend's hair."

the giver chuckled, suddenly. "we've never completely mastered
sameness. i suppose the genetic scientists are still hard at work
trying to work the kinks out. hair like fiona's must drive them
crazy."




jonas listened, trying hard to comprehend. "and the sled?" he said.
"it had that same thing: the color red. but it didn't change, giver. it
just was."

"because it's a memory from the time when color was."

"it was so-oh, i wish language were more precise! the red was so
beautiful!"

the giver nodded. "

it is."

"do you see it all the time?"

"i see all of them. all the colors."

"will i?"

"of course. when you receive the memories. you have the capacity
to see beyond. you'll gain wisdom, then, along with colors. and lots
more."

jonas wasn't interested, just then, in wisdom. it was the colors that
fascinated him. "why can't everyone see them? why did colors
disappear?"

the giver shrugged. "our people made that choice, the choice to
go to sameness. before my time, before the previous time, back
and back and back. we relinquished color when we relinquished
sunshine and did away with differences." he thought for a moment.
"we gained control of many things. but we had to let go of others."

"we shouldn't have!" jonas said fiercely.

the giver looked startled at the certainty of jonas's reaction. then
he smiled wryly. "you've come very quickly



to that conclusion," he sai

d. "it took me many years. maybe your
wisdom will come much more quickly than mine."

he glanced at the wall clock. "lie back down, now. we have so
much to do."

"giver," jonas asked as he arranged himself again on the bed,
"how did it happen to you when you were becoming the receiver?
you said that the seeing-beyond happened to you, but not the
same way."

the hands came to his back. "another day," the giver said gently.
"i'll tell you another day. now we must work. and i've thought of a
way to help you with the concept of color.

"close your eyes and be still, now. i'm going to give you a memory
of a rainbow."

days went by, and weeks. jonas learned, through the memories,
the names of colors; and now he began to see them all, in his
ordinary life (though he knew it was ordinary no longer, and would
never be again). but they didn't last. there would be a glimpse of
green-the landscaped

lawn around the central plaza; a bush on
the riverbank. the bright orange of pumpkins being trucked in from
the agricultural fields beyond the community boundary-seen in an
instant, the flash of brilliant color, but gone again, returning to their
flat and hueless shade.

the giver told him that it would be a very long time before he had


the colors to keep.

"but i want them!" jonas said angrily. "it isn't fair that nothing has
color!"

"not fair?" the giver looked at jonas curiously. "explain what you
mean."

"well ... "jonas had to stop and think it through. "if everything's the
same, then there aren't any choices! i want to wake up in the
morning and decide things! a blue tunic, or a red one?"

he looked down at himself, at the colorless fabric of his clothing.
"but it's all the same, always."



98



then he laughed a little. "i know it's not important, what you wear. it
doesn't matter. but--"

"it's the choosing that's important, isn't it?" t

he giver asked him.

jonas nodded. "my little brother--" he began, and then corrected
himself. "no, that's inaccurate. he's not my brother, not really. but
this newchild that my family takes care of-- his name's gabriel?"

"yes, i know about gabriel."

"well, he's right at the age where he's learning so much. he grabs
toys when we hold them in front of him-my father says he's
learning small-muscle control. and he's really cute."

the giver nodded.

"but now that i can see colors, at least sometimes, i was just
thinking: what if we could hold up things that were bright red, or



bright yellow, and he could choose? instead of the sameness."

"he might make wrong choices."

"oh." jonas was silent for a minute. "oh, i see what you mean. it
wouldn't matter for a newchild's toy. but later it does matter, doesn't
it? we don't dare to let people make choices of their own."

"not safe?" the giver suggested.

"definitely not safe," jonas 
 
 ___________________________
 
said with certainty. "what if they were
allowed to choose their own mate? and chose wrong?

"or what if," he went on, almost laughing at the absurdity, "they
chose their own jobs?"

"frightening, isn't it?" the giver said.

jonas chuckled. "very frightening. i can't even imagine it. we really
have to protect people from wrong choices."



99



"it's safer."

"yes," jonas agreed. "much safer."

but when the conversation turned to other things, jonas was left,
still, with a feeling of frustration that he didn't understand.

he found that he was often angry, now: irrationally angry at his
groupmates, that they were satisfied with their lives which had none
of the vibrance his own was taking on. and he was ang

ry at
himself, that he could not change that for them.

he tried. without asking permission from the giver, because he




feared-or knew-that it would be denied, he tried to give his new
awareness to his friends.

"asher," jonas said one morning, "look at those flowers very
carefully." they were standing beside a bed of geraniums planted
near the hall of open records. he put his hands on asher's
shoulders, and concentrated on the red of the petals, trying to hold
it as long as he could, and trying at the same time to transmit the
awareness of red to his friend.

"what's the matter?" asher asked une
 
 ___________________________
 
asily. "is something wrong?"
he moved away from jonas's hands. it was extremely rude for one
citizen to touch another outside of family units.

"no, nothing. i thought for a minute that they were wilting, and we
should let the gardening crew know they needed more watering."
jonas sighed, and turned away.

one evening he came home from his training weighted with new
knowledge. the giver had chosen a startling and disturbing
memory that day. under the touch of his hands, jonas had found
himself suddenly in a place that was completely alien: hot and
windswept under a vast



100



blue sky. there were tufts of sparse grass, a few bushes and rocks,
and nearby he could see an area of thicker vegetation: broad, low
trees outlined against the sky. he could hear noises: the sharp
crack of weapons-he perceived the word guns-- and then shouts,
and an immense crashing thud as something

 fell, tearing branches
from the trees.

he heard voices calling to one another. peering from the place
where he stood hidden behind some shrubbery, he was reminded



of what the giver had told him, that there had been a time when
flesh had different colors. two of these men had dark brown skin;
the others were light. going closer, he watched them hack the
tusks from a motionless elephant on the ground and haul them
away, spattered with blood. he felt himself overwhelmed with a new
perception of the color he knew as red.

then the men were gone, speeding toward the horizon in a vehicle
that spit pebbles from its whirling tires. one hit his forehead and
stung him there. but th

the elephant, but of the
being of the elephant, of the towering, immense creature and the
meticulous touch with which it had tended its friend at the end.

but his father had continued to comb lily's long hair, and lily,
impatient, had finally wiggled under her brother's touch. "jonas,"
she said, "you're hurting me with your hand."

"i apologize for hurting you, lily," jonas mumbled, and took his
hand away.

" 'ccept your apology," lily responded indifferently, stroking the
lifeless elephant.

"giver," jonas asked once, as they prepared for the day's work,
"don't you have a spouse? aren't you allowed to apply for one?"
although he was exempted from the rules against rudeness, he
was aware that this was a rude question. but the giver had
encouraged all of his questions, not seeming to be embarrassed or
offended by even the most personal.

the giver chuckled. "no, there's no rule against it.



102



and i did have a spouse. you're forgetting how old i am, jonas. my
former spouse lives now w

ith the childless adults."

"oh, of course." jonas had forgotten the giver's obvious age.
when adults of the community became older, their lives became





different. they were no longer needed to create family units.
jonas's own parents, when he and lily were grown, would go to
live with the childless adults.

"you'll be able to apply for a spouse, jonas, if you want to. i'll warn
you, though, that it will be difficult. your living arrangements will
have to be different from those of most family units, because the
books are forbidden to citizens. you and i are the o

nly ones with
access to the books."

jonas glanced around at the astonishing array of volumes. from
time to time, now, he could see their colors. with their hours
together, his and the giver's, consumed by conversation and by
the transmission of memories, jonas had not yet opened any of the
books. but he read the titles here and there, and knew that they
contained all of the knowledge of centuries, and that one day they
would belong to him.

"so if i have a spouse, and maybe children, i will have to hide the
books from them?"

the giver nodded. "i wasn't permitted to share the books with my
spouse, that's correct. and there are other difficulties, too. you
remember the rule that sa
 
 ___________________________
 
 it won't surprise you that i am forbidden to talk about my
work to anyone except the new receiver. that's you, of course.





"so there will be a whole part of your life which you won't be able to
share with a family. it's hard, jonas. it was hard for me.

"you do understand, don't you, that this is my life? the memories?"

jonas nodded again, but he was puzzled. didn't life consist of the
things you did each day? there wasn't anything else, really. "i've
seen you taking walks," he said.

the giver sighed. "i walk. i eat at mealtime. and when i am called
by the committee of elders, i appear before them, to give them
counsel and advice."

"do you advise them often?" jonas was a little frightened at the
thought that one day he would be the one to advise the ruling body.

but the giver said no. "rarely. only when they are faced with
something that they have not experienced before. then they call
upon me to use the memories and advise them. but it very seldom
happens. sometimes i wish they'd 
 
 ___________________________
 
ask for my wisdom more often-
there are so many things i could tell them; things i wish they would
change. but they don't want change. life here is so orderly, so
predictable-so painless. it's what they've chosen."

"i don't know why they even need a receiver, then, if they never
call upon him," jonas commented.

"they need me. and you," the giver said, but didn't explain. "they
were reminded of that ten years ago."



104



"what happened ten years ago?" jonas asked. "oh, i know. you
tried to train a successor and it failed. why? why did that remind
them?"



the giver smiled grimly. "when the new receiver failed, the
memories that she had received were released. they didn't come
back to me. they went ..."

he paused, and seemed to be struggling with the concept. "i don't
know, exactly. they went to the place where memories once
existe

d before receivers were created. someplace out there--" he
gestured vaguely with his arm. "and then the people had access to
them. apparently that's the way it was, once. everyone had access
to memories.

"it was chaos," he said. "they really suffered for a while. finally it
subsided as the memories were assimilated. but it certainly made
them aware of how they need a receiver to contain all that pain.
and knowledge."

"but you have to suffer like that all the time," jonas pointed out.

the giver nodded. "and you will. it's my life. it will be yours."

jonas thought about it, about what it would be like for him. "along
with walking and eating and--" he looked around the walls of books.
"reading? that's it?"

the giver shook his head. "those are simply the things that i do.
my life is here."

"in this room?"

the giver shook his head. he put his hands to his own face, to his
chest. "no. here, in my being. where the memories are."

"my instructors in science and technology have taught




 
 ___________________________
 

us about how the brain works," jonas told him eagerly. "it's full of
electrical impulses. it's like a computer. if you stimulate one part of
the brain with an electrode, it--" he stopped talking. he could see
an odd look on the giver's face.

"they know nothing," the giver said bitterly.

jonas was shocked. since the first day in the annex room, they
had together disregarded the rules about rudeness, and jonas felt
comfortable with that now. but this was different, and far beyond
rude. this was a terrible accusation. what if someone had heard?

he glanced quickly at the wall speaker, terrified that the committee
might be listening as they could at any time. but, as always during
their sessions together, the switch had been turned to off.

"nothing?" jonas whisper
 
 ___________________________
 
ed nervously. "but my instructors-"

the giver flicked his hand as if brushing something aside. "oh,
your instructors are well trained. they know their scientific facts.
everyone is well trained for his job.

"it's just that ... without the memories it's all meaningless. they
gave that burden to me. and to the previous receiver. and the one
before him."

"and back and back and back," jonas said, knowing the phrase
that always came.

the giver smiled, though his smile was oddly harsh. "that's right.
and next it will be you. a great honor."

"yes, sir. they told me that at the ceremony. the very highest
honor."

some afternoons the giver sent him away without training. jonas




giver hunched over, rocking his body slightly back and forth, his
face pale, that he would be sent away.

"go," the giver would tell him tensely. "i'm in pain today. come
back tomorrow."

on those days, worried and disappointed, jonas would walk alone
beside t

ll ordered, with fields for agriculture. the other
communities he had seen on visits were essentially the same as his
own, the only differences were slightly altered styles of dwellings,
slightly different schedules in the schools.




he wondered what lay in the far distance where he had never gone.
the land didn't end beyond those nearby communities. were there
hills elsewhere? were there vast



107



wind-torn areas like the place he had seen in memory, the place
where the elephant died?

"giver," he asked one afternoon following a day when he had been
sent away, "what causes you pain?"

when the giver was silent, jonas continued. "the chief elder told
me, at the beginning, that the receiving of memory causes terrible
pain. and you described for me that the failure of the last new
receiver released painful memories to the community.

"but i haven't suffered, giver. not really." jonas smiled. "oh, i
remember the sunburn you gave me on the very first day. but that
wasn't so terrible. wha
 
 ___________________________
 
t is it that makes you suffer so much? if you
gave some of it to me, maybe your pain would be less."

the giver nodded. "lie down," he said. "it's time, i suppose. i can't
shield you forever. you'll have to take it all on eventually.

"let me think," he went on, when jonas was on the bed, waiting, a
little fearful.



"all right," the giver said after a moment, "i've decided. we'll start
with something familiar. let's go once again to a hill, and a sled."

he placed his hands on jonas's back.




it was much the same, this memory, though the hill seemed to be a
different one, steeper, and the snow was not falling as thickly as it
had before.

it was colder, also, jonas perceived. he could see, as he sat
waiting at the top of the hill, that the snow beneath the sled was not
thick and soft as it had been before, but hard, and coated

n leg, where it lay straight on the bed,
unbroken. the brutal slice of pain was gone. but the leg ached
horribly, still, and his face felt raw.

"may i have relief-of-pain, please?" he begged. it was always
provided in his everyday life for the bruises and wounds, for a
mashed finger, a stomach ache, a skinned knee from a fall from a
bike. there was always a daub of anesthetic ointment, or a pill; or
in severe instances, an injection that brought complete and
instantaneous deliverance.

but the giver said no, and looked away.

limping, jonas walked home, pushing his bicycle, that evening.
the sunburn pain had been so small, in comparison, and had not
stayed with him. but this ache lingered.



it was not unendurable, as the pain on the hill had been. jonas
tried to be brave. he remembered that the chief elder had said he
was brave.

"is something wrong, jonas?" his father asked at the evening meal.
"you're so quiet tonight. aren't you feeling well? would you like
some medication?"

but jona

m early, and from behind the closed door
he could hear his parents and sister laughing as they gave gabriel
his evening bath.

they have never known pain, he thought. the realization made him
feel desperately lonely, and he rubbed his throbbing leg. he
eventually slept. again and again he dreamed of the anguish and
the isolation on the forsaken hill.

the daily training continued, and now it always included pain. the
agony of the fractured leg began to seem no more than a mild
discomfort as the giver led jonas firmly, little by little, into the deep
and terrible suffering of the past. each time, in his kindness, the
giver ended the afternoon with a color-filled memory of pleasure: a
brisk sail on a blue-green lake; a meadow dotted with yellow
wildflowers; an orange sunset behind mountains.

it was not enough to assuage the pain that jonas was beginning,
now, to know.




"why?" jonas asked him after he had received a torturous memory
in which he had been neglected and unfed;





the hunger
 
 ___________________________
 
 had caused excruciating spasms in his empty,
distended stomach. he lay on the bed, aching. "why do you and i
have to hold these memories?"

"it gives us wisdom," the giver replied. "without wisdom i could not
fulfill my function of advising the committee of elders when they
call upon me."

"but what wisdom do you get from hunger?" jonas groaned. his
stomach still hurt, though the memory had ended.

"some years ago," the giver told him, "before your birth, a lot of
citizens petitioned the committee of elders. they wanted to
increase the rate of births. they wanted each birthmother to be
assigned four births instead of three, so that the population would
increase and there would be more laborers available."

jonas nodded, listening. "that makes sense."

"the idea was that certain family units could accommodate an
additional child."

jonas nodded again. "mine could," he pointed out. "we have
gabriel this year, and it's
 
 ___________________________
 
 fun, having a third child."

"the committee of elders sought my advice," the giver said. "it
made sense to them, too, but it was a new idea, and they came to
me for wisdom."

"and you used your memories?"



the giver said yes. "and the strongest memory that came was
hunger. it came from many generations back. centuries back. the
population had gotten so big that hunger was everywhere.
excruciating hunger and starvation. it was followed by warfare."

warfare? it was a concept jonas did not know. but hunger was
familiar to him now. unconsciously he rubbed






112



his own abdomen, recalling the pain of its unfulfilled needs. "so you
described that to them?"

"they don't want to hear about pain. they just 
 
 ___________________________
 
n. but they sought my
advice. i told them to wait."

"but how did you know? how did you know the pilot was lost?"

"i didn't. i used my wisdom, from the memories. i knew that there
had been times in the past-terrible times-when people had
destroyed others in haste, in fear, and had brought about their own
destruction."





jonas realized something. "that means," he said slowly, "that you
have memories of destruction. and you have to give them to me,
too, because i have to get the wisdom."

the giver nodded.

"but it will hurt," jonas said. it wasn't a question. "it will hurt
terribly," the giver agreed.

"but why can't everyone have the memories? i think it would seem
a little easier if the memories were shared. you and i wouldn't have
to bear so much by ourselves, if everybody took a part."



113



the giver sighed. "you're right," he said. "but then everyone would
be burdened and pained. they don't want that. and that's the real
reason the receiver is so vital to them, and so honored. 
 
 ___________________________
 
they
selected me--and you-to lift that burden from themselves."

"when did they decide that?" jonas asked angrily. "it wasn't fair.
let's change it!"

"how do you suggest we do that? i've never been able to think of a
way, and i'm supposed to be the one with all the wisdom."

"but there are two of us now," jonas said eagerly. "together we
can think of something!"

the giver watched him with a wry smile.

"why can't we just apply for a change of rules?" jonas suggested.

the giver laughed; then jonas, too, chuckled reluctantly.

"the decision was made long before my time or yours," the giver



said, "and before the previous receiver, and--" he waited.

"back and back and back." jonas repeated the familiar phrase.
sometimes it had seemed humorous to him. sometimes it had
seemed meaningful and important.

now it was ominous. it meant, he knew, that nothing could be
changed.

the newchild, gabriel, was growing, and successfully passed the
tests of maturity that the nurture

undisturbed. finally jonas slept too.

then, as the middle hours of the night approached, the noise of
gabe's restlessness woke jonas. the newchild was turning under
his cover, flailing his arms, and beginning to whimper.

jonas rose and went to him. gently he patted gabriel's back.
sometimes that was all it took to lull him back to sleep. but the
newchild still squirmed fretfully under his hand.

still patting rhythmically, jonas began to remember the wonderful



sail that the giver had given him not long before: a bright, breezy
day on a clear turquoise lake, and above him the white sail of the
boat billowing as he moved along in the brisk wind.

he was not aware of giving the memory; but suddenly he realized
that it was becoming dimmer, that it was sliding through his hand
into the being of the newchild. gabriel became quiet. startled,
jonas pulled back what was left of the memory with a burst of will.
he removed his hand from the little back and stood quietly beside

a while, soothing his own nervousness at what had occurred, then
let it go and returned to his bed.

once more, toward dawn, the newchild woke and cried out. again
jonas went to him. this time he quite deliberately placed his hand
firmly on gabriel's back, and



117



released the rest of the calming day on the lake. again gabriel
slept.

but now jonas lay awake, thinking. he no longer had any more
than a wisp of the memory, and he felt a small lack where it had
been. he could ask the giver for another sail, he knew. a sail
perhaps on ocean, next time, for jonas had a memory of ocean,
now, and knew what it was; he knew that there were sailboats
there, too, in memories yet to be acquired.

he wondered, though, if he should confess to the giver that he
had given a memory away. he was not yet qualified to be a giver



himself; nor had gabriel been selected to be a receiver.



that he had this power frightened him. he decided not to tell.

jonas entered the annex room a
 
 ___________________________
 
nd realized immediately that it was
a day when he would be sent away. the giver was rigid in his
chair, his face in his hands.

"i'll come back tomorrow, sir," he said quickly. then he hesitated.
"unless maybe there's something i can do to help."

the giver looked up at him, his face contorted with suffering.
"please," he gasped, "take some of the pain."

jonas helped him to his chair at the side of the bed. then he
quickly removed his tunic and lay face down. "put your hands on
me," he directed, aware that in such anguish the giver might need
reminding.

the hands came, and the pain came with them and through them.
jonas braced himself and entered the memory which was torturing
the giver.

he was in a confused, noisy, foul-smelling place. it was 
 
 ___________________________
 
ing for water and for mother and for death. horses
lying on the ground shrieked, raised their heads, and stabbed



randomly toward the sky with their hooves.


from the distance, jonas could hear the thud of cannons.
overwhelmed by pain, he lay there in the fearsome stench for
hours, listened to the men and animals die, and learned what
warfare meant.

finally, when he knew that he could bear it no longer and would
welcome death himself, he opened his eyes and was once again on
the bed.



the giver looked away, as if he could not bear to see what he had
done to jonas. "forgive me," he said.



121



16

jonas did not want to go back. he didn't want the memories, didn't
want the honor, didn't want the wisdom, didn't want the pain. he
wanted his childhood again, his scraped knees and ball games. he
sat in his dwelling alone, watching through the window, seeing
children at play, citizens bicycling home from uneventful days at
work, ordinary lives free of anguish because he had been selected

,
as others before him had, to bear their burden.

but the choice was not his. he returned each day to the annex
room.

the giver was gentle with him for many days following the terrible
shared memory of war.

"there are so many good memories," the giver reminded jonas.




and it was true. by now jonas had experienced countless bits of
happiness, things he had never known of before.

he had seen a birthday parry, with one child singled out and
celebrated on his day, so that now he understood the joy of being
an individual, special and unique and proud.

he had visited museums and seen paintings filled with all the colors
he could now recognize and name.



122



in one ecstatic memory he had ridden a gleaming brown horse
across a field that s
 
 ___________________________
 
ch both he and the horse drank
cold, clear water. now he understood about animals; and in the
moment that the horse turned from the stream and nudged jonas's
shoulder affectionately with its head, he perceived the bonds
between animal and human.

he had walked through woods, and sat at night beside a campfire.
although he had through the memories learned about the pain of
loss and loneliness, now he gained, too, an understanding of
solitude and its joy.

"what is your favorite?" jonas asked the giver. "you don't have to
give it away yet," he added quickly. "just tell me about it, so i can
look forward to it, because i'll have to receive it when your job is
done."

the giver smiled. "lie down," he said. "i'm happy to give it to you."

jonas felt the joy of it as soon as the memory began. sometimes it
took a while for him to get his bearings, to find his place. but this
time he fit right in and felt the happiness that pervaded the memory.




he was in a room filled with people, and it was wa

 by one to untie the
ribbons on the packages, to unwrap the bright papers, open the
boxes and reveal toys and clothing and books. there were cries of
delight. they hugged one another.

the small child went and sat on the lap of the old woman, and she
rocked him and rubbed her cheek against his.

jonas opened his eyes and lay contentedly on the bed, still
luxuriating in the warm and comforting memory. it had all been
there, all the things he had learned to treasure.

"what did you perceive?" the giver asked. "warmth," jonas
replied, "and happiness. and--let me think. family. that it was a
celebration of some sort, a holiday. and something else-l can't
quite get the word for it."

"it will come to you."





"who were the old people? why were they there?" it had puzzled
jonas, seeing them in the room. the old of the community did not
ever leave their special place, the house of the old, where they
were so well cared for and respected.

"they were called grandparents."



124



"grand parents

?"

"grandparents. it meant parents-of-the-parents, long ago."

"back and back and back?" jonas began to laugh. "so actually,
there could be parents-of-the-parents-of-the-parents-of-the
parents?"

the giver laughed, too. "that's right. it's a little like looking at
yourself looking in a mirror looking at yourself looking in a mirror."

jonas frowned. "but my parents must have had parents! i never
thought about it before. who are my parents-of-the-parents? where
are they?"

"you could go look in the hall of open records. you'd find the
names. but think, son. if you apply for children, then who will be
their parents-of-the-parents? who will be their grandparents?"

"my mother and father, of course."

hildren if she applies for them, and then mother and


father--"

"that's right."

"as long as they're still working and contributing to the community,
they'll go and live with the other childless adults. and they won't be
part of my life anymore.

"and after that, when the time comes, they'll go to the house of the
old," jonas went on. he was thinking aloud. "and they'll be well
cared for, and respected, and when they're released, there will be a
celebration."




"which you won't attend," the giver pointed out.

"no, of course not, because i won't even know about it. by then i'll
be so busy with my own life. and lily will, too. so our children, if we
have them, won't know who their parents-of-parents are, either.

"it seems to work pretty well that way, doesn't it? the way we do it
in our community?" jonas asked. "i just didn't realize there was any
other way, until i received that memory."

"it works," the giver agreed.

jonas hesitated. "i certainly liked the memory, though. i can see
w

hy it's your favorite. i couldn't quite get the word for the whole
feeling of it, the feeling that was so strong in the room."

"love," the giver told him.

jonas repeated it. "love." it was a word and concept new to him.

they were both silent for a minute. then jonas said, "giver?"



"yes?"

"i feel very foolish saying this. very, very foolish."

"no need. nothing is foolish here. trust the memories and how they
make you feel."

"well," jonas said, looking at the floor, "i know you don't have the
memory anymore, because you gave it to me, so maybe you won't
understand this--"

"i will. i am left with a vague wisp of that one; and i have many
other memories of families, and holidays, and happiness. of love."

jonas blurted out what he was feeling. "i was thinking that .

to live, with the old right there in the same place, where maybe
they wouldn't be well taken care of, the way they are now, and that
we have a better-arranged way of doing things. but anyway, i was
thinking, i mean feeling, actually, that it was kind of nice, then. and
that i wish we could be that way, and that you could be my
grandparent. the family in the memory seemed a little more--" he
faltered, not able to find the word he wanted.

"a little more complete," the giver suggested.

jonas nodded. "i liked the feeling of love," he confessed. he
glanced nervously at the speaker on the wall, reassuring himself
that no one was listening. "i wish we still had that," he whispered.
"of course," he added quickly, "i do understand that it wouldn't work
very well. and that it's much better to be organized the way we are
now. i can see that it was a dangerous way to live."





"what do you mean?"

jonas hesitated. he wasn't certain, really, what he had meant. he
could fe

lily grinned. "i have a better idea for one more story," she
announced. "what if actually we were all twins and didn't know it,
and so elsewhere there would be another lily, and another jonas,
and another father, and another asher, and another chief elder,
and another--"



father groaned. "lily," he said. "it's bedtime."



139

"giver," jonas asked the next afternoon, "do you ever think about
release?"

"do you mean my own release, or just the general topic of
release?"

"both, i guess. i apologi— i mean i should have been more precise.
but i don't know exactly what i meant."

"sit back up. no need to lie down while we're talking." jonas, who
had already been stretched out on the bed when the question came
to his mind, sat back up.

"i guess i do think about it occasionally," the giver said. "i think
about my own release w
 
 ___________________________
 
hen i'm in an awful lot of pain. i wish i
could put in a request for it, sometimes. but i'm not permitted to do



that until the new receiver is trained."



"me," jonas said in a dejected voice. he was not looking forward to
the end of the training, when he would become the new receiver. it
was clear to him what a terribly difficult and lonely life it was,
despite the honor.

"i can't request release either," jonas pointed out. "it was in my
rules."

the giver laughed harshly. "i know that. they hammered out those
rules after the failure ten years ago."



140



jonas had heard again and again now, reference to the previous
failure. but he still did not know what had happened ten years
before. "giver," he said, "tell me what happened. please."

the giver shrugged. "on the surface, it was quite simple. a
receiver-to-be was selected, the way you were. the selection went
smoothly enough. the ceremony was held, and the selection was
made. the crowd chee
 
 ___________________________
 
red, as they did for you. the new receiver
was puzzled and a little frightened, as you were."

"my parents told me it was a female."

the giver nodded.

jonas thought of his favorite female, fiona, and shivered. he
wouldn't want his gentle friend to suffer the way he had, taking on
the memories. "what was she like?" he asked the giver.

the giver looked sad, thinking about it. "she was a remarkable
young woman. very self-possessed and serene. intelligent, eager
to learn." he shook his head and drew a deep breath. "you know,



jonas, when she came to me in this room, when she presented
herself to begin her training-- "

jonas interrupted him with a question. "can you tell me her name?
my parents said that it wasn't to be spoken again in the community.
but couldn't you say it just to me?"

the giver hesitated painfully, as if saying the 
 
 ___________________________
 
name aloud might be
excruciating. "her name was rosemary," he told jonas, finally.

"rosemary. i like that name."

the giver went on. "when she came to me for the first



141



time, she sat there in the chair where you sat on your first day. she
was eager and excited and a little scared. we talked. i tried to
explain things as well as i could."

"the way you did to me."

the giver chuckled ruefully. "the explanations are difficult. the
whole thing is so beyond one's experience. but i tried. and she
listened carefully. her eyes were very luminous, i remember."

he looked up suddenly. "jonas, i gave you a memory that i told you
was my favorite. i still have a shred of it left. the room, with the
family, and grandparents?"

jonas nodded. of course he remembered. "yes," he said. "it had
that wonderful feeling with it. you told me it was love."

"you can understand, then, tha
 
 ___________________________
 
t that's what i felt for rosemary,"
the giver explained. "i loved her. "i feel it for you, too," he added.



"what happened to her?" jonas asked.

"her training began. she received well, as you do. she was so
enthusiastic. so delighted to experience new things. i remember
her laughter ... "

his voice faltered and trailed off.

"what happened?" jonas asked again, after a moment. "please tell
me."

the giver closed his eyes. "it broke my heart, jonas, to transfer
pain to her. but it was my job. it was what i had to do, the way i've
had to do it to you."

the room was silent. jonas waited. finally the giver continued.

"five weeks. that was all. i gave her happy memories: a ride on a
merry-go-round; a kitten to play with; a picnic.



142



sometimes i chose one just because i knew it would make her
laugh, and i so treasured the sound of that laughter in this room
that had always been so silent.

"
 
 ___________________________
 
but she was like you, jonas. she wanted to experience everything.
she knew that it was her responsibility. and so she asked me for
more difficult memories."

jonas held his breath for a moment. "you didn't give her war, did
you? not after just five weeks?"

the giver shook his head and sighed. "no. and i didn't give her
physical pain. but i gave her loneliness. and i gave her loss. i
transferred a memory of a child taken from its parents. that was the



first one. she appeared stunned at its end."

jonas swallowed. rosemary, and her laughter, had begun to seem
real to him, and he pictured her looking up from the bed of
memories, shocked.

the giver continued. "i backed off, gave her more little delights. but
everything changed, once she knew about pain. i

could see it in her
eyes."

"she wasn't brave enough?" jonas suggested.

the giver didn't respond to the question. "she insisted that i
continue, that i not spare her. she said it was her duty. and i knew,
of course, that she was correct.

"i couldn't bring myself to inflict physical pain on her. but i gave her
anguish of many kinds. poverty, and hunger, and terror.

"i had\o, jonas. it was my job. and she had been chosen." the
giver looked at him imploringly. jonas stroked his hand.

"finally one afternoon, we finished for the day. it had been a hard
session. i tried to finish-as i do with



143



you-by transferring something happy and cheerful. but the times of
laughter were gone by then. she stood up very silently, frowning,
as if she were making a decision. then she came over to me and
put her arms around me. she kissed my cheek." as jonas watched,
the giver stroked his own cheek, recalling the touch of rosemary's
li
 
 ___________________________
 
ps ten years before.

"she left here that day, left this room, and did not go back to her
dwelling. i was notified by the speaker that she had gone directly to


the chief elder and asked to be released."

"but it's against the rules! the receiver-in-training can't apply for
rel-"

"it's in your rules, jonas. but it wasn't in hers. she asked for
release, and they had to give it to her. i never saw her again."

so that was the failure, jonas thought. it was obvious that it
saddened the giver very deeply. but it didn't seem such a terrible
thing, after all. and he, jonas, would never have done it~never
have requested release, no matter now difficult his training became.
the giver needed a successor, and he had been chosen.

a thought occurred to jonas. rosemary had been released very
early in her training. what if something happened to him, jonas?
he had a whole year's worth of memories now.

"giver," he asked, "i can't request release, i know that. but what if
something happened: a

, did? well, that doesn't make sense because
i'm a good swimmer. but what if i couldn't swim, and fell into the
river and was

lost? then there wouldn't be a new receiver, but you would already
have given away an awful lot of important memories, so even
though they would select a new receiver, the memories would be
gone except for the shreds that you have left of them? and then
what if- "

he started to laugh, suddenly. "i sound like my sister, lily," he said,
amused at himself.



the giver looked at him gravely. "you just stay away from the river,
my friend," he said. "the community lost rosemary after five weeks
and it was a disaster for them. i don't know whatxhe community
would do if they lost you."

"why was it a disaster?"

"i think i mentioned to you once," the giver reminded him, "that
when she was gone, the memories came back to the people. if you
were to be lost in the river, jonas, your memories would not be lost
with you. memories are forever.

"rosemary had only those
 
 ___________________________
 
 five weeks worth, and most of them
were good ones. but there were those few terrible memories, the
ones that had overwhelmed her. for a while they overwhelmed the
community. all those feelings! they'd never experienced that
before.

"i was so devastated by my own grief at her loss, and my own
feeling of failure, that i didn't even try to help them through it. i was
angry, too."

the giver was quiet for a moment, obviously thinking. "you know,"
he said, finally, "if they lost you, with all the training you've had now,
they'd have all those memories again themselves."

jonas made a face. "they'd hate that."



145



"they certainly would. they wouldn't know how to deal with it at
all."

"the only way i deal with it is by having you there to help me,"
jonas pointed out with a sigh.



the giver nodded. "i suppose," he said slowly, "that i could--"

"you could what?"

the giver was

river, i suppose i could help the whole community
the way i've helped you. it's an interesting concept. i need to think
about it some more. maybe we'll talk about it again sometime. but
not now.



"i'm glad you're a good swimmer, jonas. but stay away from the
river." he laughed a little, but the laughter was not lighthearted. his
thoughts seemed to be elsewhere, and his eyes were very troubled.



146

jonas glanced at the clock. there was so much work to be done,
always, that he and the giver seldom simply sat and talked, the
way they just had.

"i'm sorry that i wasted so much time with my questions," jonas
said. "i was only asking about release because my father is
releasing a newchild today. a twin. he has to select one and
release the other one. they do it by weight." jonas glanced at the
clock. "actually, i suppose he's already finished. i think it was this
morning."

the giver's face took on a solemn look. "i wish they wouldn't do
that," he said quietly, almost to himself.

"w
 
 ___________________________
 
ell, they can't have two identical people around! think how
confusing it would be!" jonas chuckled.



"i wish i could watch," he added, as an afterthought. he liked the
thought of seeing his father perform the ceremony, and making the
little twin clean and comfy. his father was such a gentle man.

"you can watch," the giver said.

"no," jonas told him. "they never let children watch. it's very
private."

"jonas," the giver told him, "i know that you read your training
instructions very carefully. don't you remember that you are
allowed to ask anyone anything?"



147



jonas nodded. "yes, but-- "

"jonas, when you and i have finished our time together, you will be
the new receiver. you can read the books; you'll have the
memories. you have access to everything. it's part of your training.
if you want to watch a release, you have simply to ask."

jonas shrugged. "well, maybe i will, then. but it's too late for th
 
 ___________________________
 
is
one. i'm sure it was this morning."

the giver told him, then, something he had not known. "all private
ceremonies are recorded. they're in the hall of closed records.
do you want to see this morning's release?"

jonas hesitated. he was afraid that his father wouldn't like it, if he
watched something so private.

"i think you should," the giver told him firmly.

"all right, then," jonas said. "tell me how."



the giver rose from his chair, went to the speaker on the wall, and
clicked the switch from off to on.

the voice spoke immediately. "yes, receiver. how may i help
you?"

"i would like to see this morning's release of the twin."

"one moment, receiver. thank you for your instructions."

jonas watched the video screen above the row of switches. its
blank face began to flicker with zig-zag lines; then some numbers
appeared, followed by the date and time. he was astonished and
delighted that this was availa

 small windowless room, empty except for
a bed, a table with some equipment on it-jonas recognized a
scale; he had seen them before, when he'd been doing volunteer
hours at the nurturing center-

and a cupboard. he could see pale carpeting on the floor.

"it's just an ordinary room," he commented. "i thought maybe they'd
have it in the auditorium, so that everybody could come. all the old
go to ceremonies of release. but i suppose that when it's just a
newborn, they don't-"

"shhh," the giver said, his eyes on the screen. jonas's father,
wearing his nurturing uniform, entered the room, cradling a tiny
newchild wrapped in a soft blanket in his arms. a uniformed woman
followed through the door, carrying a second newchild wrapped in a
similar blanket.



"that's my father." jonas found himself whispering, as if he might
wake the little ones if he spoke aloud. "and the other nurturer is his
assistant. she's still in training, but she'll be finished soon."

the two nurturers unwrapped th

e'd have a problem. but this one," he handed one, after
rewrapping it, to his assistant, "is six pounds even. so you can
clean him up and dress him and take him over to the center."

the woman took the newchild and left through the door she had
entered.

jonas watched as his father bent over the squirming newchild on
the bed. "and you, little guy, you're only five






149



pounds ten ounces. a s hrimp!"

"that's the special voice he uses with gabriel," jonas remarked,
smiling.

"watch," the giver said.

"now he cleans him up and makes him comfy," jonas told him. "he
told me."

"be quiet, jonas," the giver commanded in a strange voice. "



watch ."

obediently jonas concentrated on the screen, waiting for what
would happen next. he was especially curious about the ceremony
part.

his father turned and opened the cupboard. he took out a syringe
and a small bottle. very carefully he inserted the needle into the
bottle and began to fill the syringe with a clear liquid.

jonas winced sympat

hetically. he had forgotten that newchildren
had to get shots. he hated shots himself, though he knew that they
were necessary.

to his surprise, his father began very carefully to direct the needle
into the top of newchild's forehead, puncturing the place where the
fragile skin pulsed. the newborn squirmed, and wailed faintly.

"why's he--"

"shhh," the giver said sharply.

his father was talking, and jonas realized that he was hearing the
answer to the question he had started to ask. still in the special
voice, his father was saying, "i know, i know. it hurts, little guy. but i
have to use a vein, and the veins in your arms are still too teeny-
weeny."

he pushed the plunger very slowly, injecting the liquid into the scalp
vein until the syringe was empty.



150



"all done. that wasn't so bad, was it?" jonas heard his father say
cheerfully. he t

urned aside and dropped the syringe into a waste
receptacle.



now he cleans him up and makes him comfy, jonas said to
himself, aware that the giver didn't want to talk during the little
ceremony.

as he continued to watch, the newchild, no longer crying, moved
his arms and legs in a jerking motion. then he went limp. he head
fell to the side, his eyes half open. then he was still.

with an odd, shocked feeling, jonas recognized the gestures and
posture and expression. they were familiar. he had seen them
before. but he couldn't remember where.

jonas stared at the screen, waiting for something to happen. but
nothing did. the little twin la

d lifted the limp body into it.
he placed the lid on tightly.

he picked up the carton and carried it to the other side of the room.
he opened a small door in the wall; jonas could see darkness
behind the door. it seemed to be the



151



same sort of chute into which trash was deposited at school.

his father loaded the carton containing the body into the chute and



gave it a shove.

"bye-bye, little guy," jonas heard his father say before he left the
room. then the screen went blank.

the giver turned to him. quite calmly, he related, "when the
speaker notified me that rosemary had applied for release, they
turned on the tape to show me the process. there she was~my last
glimpse of that beautiful child-waiting. they brought in the syringe
and asked her to roll up her sleeve.

"you suggested, jonas, that perhaps she wasn't brave enough? i
don't know about bravery: what it is, what it means. i do know that i
sat here numb with horror. wretched with helplessness. and i
listened as rosema

ry told them that she would prefer to inject
herself.

"then she did so. i didn't watch. i looked away." the giver turned
to him. "well, there you are, jonas. you were wondering about
release," he said in a bitter voice.

jonas felt a ripping sensation inside himself, the feeling of terrible
pain clawing its way forward to emerge in a cry.



152

"i won't! i won't go home! you can't make me!" jonas sobbed and
shouted and pounded the bed with his fists.

"sit up, jonas," the giver told him firmly.

jonas obeyed him. weeping, shuddering, he sat on the edge of the
bed. he would not look at the giver.



"you may stay here tonight. i want to talk to you. but you must be
quiet now, while i notify your family unit. no one must hear you cry."

jonas looked up wildly. "no one heard that little twin cry, either! no
one but my father!" he collapsed in sobs again.

the giver waited silently. finally jonas was able to quiet himself
and he sat huddled, his shoulders shaking.

tonight, for additional training."

"i will take care of that, sir. thank you for your instructions," the
voice said.

"i will take care of that, sir. i will take care of that, sir," jonas
mimicked in a cruel, sarcastic voice. "i will do whatever



153

people? i'd be happy to kill them, sir. thank you for your
instructions, sir. how may i help y--', he couldn't seem to stop.

the giver grasped his shoulders firmly. jonas fell silent and stared
at him.

"listen to me, jonas. they can't help it. they know nothing."

"you said that to me once before."

"i said it because it's true. it's the way they live. it's the life that was



created for them. it's the same life that you would have, if you had
not been chosen as my successor." "but he hedxo me!" jonas
wept.

"it's what he was told to do, and he knows nothing else."

"what about you? do you lie to me, too?" jonas almost spat

 the
question at the giver.

"i am empowered to lie. but i have never lied to you."

jonas stared at him. "release is always like that? for people who
break the rules three times? for the old? do they kill the old, too?"

"yes, it's true."

"and what about fiona? she loves the old! she's in training to care
for them. does she know yet? what will she do when she finds out?
how will she feel?" jonas brushed wetness from his face with the
back of one hand.

"fiona is already being trained in the fine art of release," the gi

told him. "she's very efficient at her work, your red-haired friend.
feelings are not part of the life she's learned."

jonas wrapped his arms around himself and rocked his



154



own body back and forth. "what should i do? i can't go back! i
can't!"

the giver stood up. "first, i will order our evening meal. then we
will eat."

jonas found himself using the nasty, sarcastic voice again. "then



we'll have a sharing of feelings?"

the giver gave a rueful, anguished, empty laugh. "jonas, you and i
are the only ones who have feelings. we've been sharing them now
for almost a year."

"i'm sorry, giver," jonas said miserably. "i don't mean to be so
hateful. not to you."

the giver rubbed jonas's hunched shoulders. "and after we eat,"
he went on, "we'll make a plan."

jonas looked up, puzzled. "a plan for what? there's nothing.
there's nothing we can do. it's always been this way. before me,
before you, before the ones who came before

you. back and back
and back." his voice trailed the familiar phrase.

"jonas," the giver said, after a moment, "it's true that it has been
this way for what seems forever. but the memories tell us that it has
not always been. people felt things once. you and i have been part
of that, so we know. we know that they once felt things like pride,
and sorrow, and--"

"and love," jonas added, remembering the family scene that had
so affected him. "and pain." he thought again of the soldier.

"the worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. it's the
loneliness of it. memories need 
 
 ___________________________
 
to be shared."

"i've started to share them with you," jonas said, trying to cheer
him.



155



"that's true. and having you here with me over the past year has
made me realize that things must change. for years i've felt that


they should, but it seemed so hopeless.

"now for the first time i think there might be a way," the giver said
slowly. "and you brought it to my attention, barely-- " he glanced at
the dock, "two hours ago."

jonas watched him, and listened.

it was late at night, now. they had talked and talked. jonas sat
wrapped in a robe belonging to the giver, the long robe that only
elders wore.

it was possible, what they had planned. barely possible. if it failed,
he would very likely be killed.

but what did that matter? if he stayed, his life was no longer worth
living.

"yes," he told the giver. "i'll do

it. i think i can do it. i'll try, anyway.
but i want you to come with me."

the giver shook his head. "jonas," he said, "the community has
depended, all these generations, back and back and back, on a
resident receiver to hold their memories for them. i've turned over
many of them to you in the past year. and i can't take them back.
there's no way for me to get them back if i have given them.

"so if you escape, once you are gone--and, jonas, you know that
you can never return--"

jonas nodded solemnly. it was the terrifying part. "yes," he said, "i
know. but if you come with me

--"

the giver shook his head and made a gesture to silence him. he
continued. "if you get away, if you get beyond, if you get to
elsewhere, it will mean that the community



has to bear the burden themselves, of the memories you had been
holding for them.

"i think that they can, and that they will acquire some wisdom. but it
will be desperately hard for them. when we lost rosemary ten
years ago, and her memories returned to the people, they
panicked. and those were such few memories, compared to yours.
whe

 then. and now they will."

"it's no use. they'll find someone to take my place. they'll choose a
new receiver."

"there's no one ready for training, not right away. oh, they'll speed
up the selection, of course. but i can't think of another child who
has the right qualities--"

"there's a little female with pale eyes. but she's only a six."

"that's correct. i know the one you mean. her name is katharine.
but she's too young. so they will be forcedxo bear those
memories."

"i want you to come, giver," jonas pleaded.

"no. i have to stay here," the giver said firmly. "i want to, jonas. if
i go with you, and together we take away all their protection from
the memories, jonas, the community will be left with no one to help
them. they'll be thrown into chaos. they'll destroy themselves. i



can't go."

"giver," jonas suggested, "you and i don't need to care about the
rest of them."



157



the giver looked at him with a questioning smile. jonas hung his
head. of course they needed to care. 
 
 ___________________________
 
it was the meaning of
everything.

"and in any case, jonas," the giver sighed, "i wouldn't make it. i'm
very weakened now. do you know that i no longer see colors?"

jonas's heart broke. he reached for the giver's hand.

"you have the colors," the giver told him. "and you have the
courage. i will help you to have the strength."

"a year ago," jonas reminded him, "when i had just become a
twelve, when i began to see the first color, you told me that the
beginning had been different for you. but that i wouldn't
understand."

the giver brightened. "that's true. and do you know, jonas, that
with all your knowledge now, with all your memories, with all you've
learned-- still you won't understand? because i've been a little
selfish. i haven't given

any of it to you. i wanted to keep it for myself
to the last."

"keep what?"

"when i was just a boy, younger than you, it began to come to me.
but it wasn't the seeing-beyond for me. it was different. for me, it
was hearing-bey ond. "



jonas frowned, trying to figure that out. "what did you hear?" he
asked.

"music," the giver said, smiling. "i began to hear something truly
remarkable, and it is called music. i'll give you some before i go."

jonas shook his head emphatically. "no, giver," he said. "i want
you to keep that, to have with you, when i'm gone."



158



jonas went home the next morning, cheerfully greeted his parents,
and lied easily about what a busy, pleasant night he had had.

his father smiled and lied easily, too, about his busy and pleasant
day the day before.

throughout the school day, as he did his lessons, jonas went over
the plan in his head. it seemed startlingly simple. jonas and the
giver had gone over it and over it, late into the night hours.

for

the next two weeks, as the time for the december ceremony
approached, the giver would transfer every memory of courage
and strength that he could to jonas. he would need those to help
him find the elsewhere that they were both sure existed. they knew
it would be a very difficult journey.

then, in the middle of the night before the ceremony, jonas would
secretly leave his dwelling. this was probably the most dangerous
part, because it was a violation of a major rule for any citizen not on
official business to leave a dwelling at night.

"i'll leave at midnight," jonas said

. "the food collectors will be
finished picking up the evening-meal remains by then, and the




path-maintenance crews don't start their work that early. so there
won't be anyone to see me, unless of course someone is out on
emergency business."

"i don't know what you should do if you are seen, jonas," the giver
had said. "i have memories, of course, of all kinds of escapes.
people fleeing from terrible things throughout history. but every
situation is individual. there is no memory of one like this."

"i'll be careful," jonas said. "no one will see me."

"as receiver-in-training, you're held in very high respect already.
so i think you wouldn't be questioned very forcefully."

"i'd just say i was on some important errand for the receiver. i'd
say it was all your fault that i was out after hou

rs," jonas teased.

they both laughed a little nervously. but jonas was certain that he
could slip away, unseen, from his house, carrying an extra set of
clothing. silently he would take his bicycle to the riverbank and
leave it there hidden in bushes with the clothing folded beside it.

then he would make his way through the darkness, on foot,
silently, to the annex.

"there's no nighttime attendant," the giver explained. "i'll leave the
door unlocked. you simply slip into the room. i'll be waiting for you."

his parents would discover, when they woke, that he was gone.
they would also find a cheerful note from jonas on his bed, telling
them that he was going for an early morning ride along the river;
that he would be back for the ceremony.

his parents would be irritated but not alarmed. they would think



him inconsiderate and they would plan to chastise him, later.

they would wait, with mounting

eir parenting. and anyway, everyone is so involved in
the ceremony that they



160



probably won't notice that i'm not there. now that i'm a twelve and
in training, i don't have to sit with my age group any more. so asher
will think i'm with my parents, or with you--"

"and your parents will assume you're with asher, or with me--"

jonas shrugged. "it will take everyone a while to realize that i'm not
there at all."

"and you and i will be long on our way by then."

in the early morning, the giver would order a vehicle and driver
from the speaker. he visited the other communities frequently,
meeting with their elders; his responsibilities extended over all the
surrounding areas. so this would not be an unusual undertaking.

ordinarily the giver did not attend the december ceremony. last
year he had been present because of the occasion of jonas's
selection, in which he was so involved. but his life was usually quite
separate from that of the community. no one would comment on
his absence,
 
 ___________________________
 
 or on the fact that he had chosen this day to be away.

when the driver and vehicle arrived, the giver would send the
driver on some brief errand. during his absence, the giver would



help jonas hide in the storage area of the vehicle. he would have
with him a bundle of food which the giver would save from his own
meals during the next two weeks.

the ceremony would begin, with all the community there, and by
then jonas and the giver would be on their way.

by midday jonas's absence would become apparent, and would be
a cause for serious concern. the ceremony



161



would not be disrupted-such a disruption would be unthinkable.
but searchers would be sent out into the community.

by the time his bicycle and clothing were found, the giver would
be returning. jonas, by then, would be on his own, making his
journey elsewhere.

the giver, on his return, would find the community in a state of
confusion and panic. confronted b

h they had
never faced before, and having no memories from which to find
either solace or wisdom, they would not know what to do and would
seek his advice.

he would go to the auditorium where the people would be
gathered, still. he would stride to the stage and command their
attention.

he would make the solemn announcement that jonas had been
lost in the river. he would immediately begin the ceremony of loss.

"jonas, jonas," they would say loudly, as they had once said the
name of caleb. the giver would lead the chant. together they
would let jonas's presence in their lives fade away as they said his



name in unison more slowly, softer and softer, until he was
disappearing from them, until he was no more than an occasional
murmur and then, by the end of the long day, gone forever, not to
be mentioned again.

their attention would turn to the overwhelming task of bearing the
memories themselves. the giver would help them.

"yes, i understand that they'll need you," jonas had said at the
 
 ___________________________
 
 end
of the lengthy discussion and planning. "but



162



i'll need you, too. please come with me." he knew the answer even
as he made the final plea.

"my work will be finished," the giver had replied gently, "when i
have helped the community to change and become whole.

"i'm grateful to you, jonas, because without you i would never have
figured out a way to bring about the change. but your role now is to
escape. and my role is to stay."

"but don't you wantxo be with me, giver?" jonas asked sadly.

the giver hugged him. "i love you, jonas," he said. "but i have
another place to go. when my work here is finished, i want to be
with my daughter."

jonas had been staring glumly at the floor. now he looked up,
startled. "i didn't know you had a daughter, giver! you told me that
you'd had a spouse. but i never knew about your daughter."

the giver smiled, and nodded. for the first time in their long
months together, jonas saw him look truly happy.



"her name was rosemary

it would work. they could make it work, jonas told himself again
and again throughout the day.

but that evening everything changed. all of it--a.ll the things they
had thought through so meticulously-fell apart.

that night, jonas was forced to flee. he left the dwelling shortly
after the sky became dark and the community still. it was terribly
dangerous because some of the work crews were still about, but he
moved stealthily and silently, staying in the shadows, making his
way past th

ust take him farther from the community.

now he was on the bridge, hunched over on the bicycle, pedaling
steadily. he could see the dark, churning water far below.

he felt, surprisingly, no fear, nor any regret at leaving






the community behind. but he felt a very deep sadness that he had
left his closest friend behind. he knew that in the danger of his
escape he must be absolutely silent; but with his heart and mind,
he called back and hoped that with his capacity for hearing-beyond,
the giver would know that jonas had said goodbye.



it had happened at the evening meal. the family unit was eating
together as always: lily chattering away, mother and father making
their customary comments (and lies, jonas knew) about the day.
nearby, gabriel played happily on the floor, babbling his baby talk,
looking with glee now and then toward jonas, obviously delighted
to have him back after the unexpected night away from the
dwelling.

father glanced down toward the toddler. "enjoy it, little g

water lapping hypnotically against a beach nearby. as the memory
seeped from him into the newchild, he could feel gabe's sleep ease
and deepen. there had been no stir at all when jonas lifted him
from the crib and placed him gently into the molded seat.

he knew that he had the remaining hours of night before they
would be aware of his escape. so he rode hard, steadily, willing
himself not to tire as the minutes and miles passed. there had
been no time to receive the memories he and the giver had
counted on, of strength and courage. so he relied on what he had,
and hoped it would be enough.

he circled the outlying communities, their dwellings



dark. gradually the distances between communities widened, with
longer stretches of empty road. his legs ached at first; then, as time
passed, they became numb.

at dawn gabriel began to stir. they were in an isolated place; fields
on either side of the road were dotted with thickets of trees here
and there. he saw a stream, and made his wa

on the bicycle by night.

his leg muscles were taut now. they ached when he settled
himself to sleep. but they were stronger, and he stopped now less
often to rest. sometimes he paused and lifted gabriel down for a
brief bit of exercise, running down the road or through a field
together in the dark. but always, when he returned, strapped the
uncomplaining toddler into the seat again, and remounted, his legs
were ready.

so he had enough strength of his own, and had not needed what
the giver might have provided, had there been time.

but when the planes came, he wished that he could have received
the courage.

he knew they were search planes. they flew so low that they woke
him with the noise of their engines, and sometimes, looking out and
up fearfully from the hiding places, he could almost see the faces of
the searchers.

he knew that they could not see color, and that their



flesh, as well as gabriel's light golden curls, would be no more than
smears of gray against the color

h could identify body
warmth and would hone in on two humans huddled in shrubbery.

so always, when he heard the aircraft sound, he reached to gabriel
and transmitted memories of snow, keeping some for himself.
together they became cold; and when the planes were gone, they
would shiver, holding each other, until sleep came again.

sometimes, urging the memories into gabriel, jonas felt that they
were more shallow, a little weaker than they had been. it was what
he had hoped, and what he and the giver had planned: that as he
moved away from the community, he would shed the memories and
leave them behind for the people. but now, when he needed them,
when the planes came, he tried hard to cling to what he still had, of
cold, and to use it for their survival.

usually the aircraft came by day, when they were hiding. but he
was alert at night, too, on the road, always listening intently for the
sound of the engines. even gabriel listened, and would call out,
"plane! plane!" sometimes before jona

trength.

they saw their first waterfall, and for the first time wildlife.

"plane! plane!" gabriel called, and jonas turned swiftly into the
trees, though he had not seen planes in days, and he did not hear
an aircraft engine now. when he stopped the bicycle in the
shrubbery and turned to grab gabe, he saw the small chubby arm
pointing toward the sky.

terrified, he looked up, but it was not a plane at all. though he had
never seen one before, he identified it from his fading memories, for
the giver had given them to him often. it was a bird.

soon there were many birds along the way, soaring overhead,
calling. they saw deer; and once, beside the road, looking at them
curious and unafraid, a small reddish-brown creature with a thick
tail, whose name jonas did not know. he slowed the bike and they
stared at one another until the creature turned away and
disappeared into the woods.

all of it was new to him. after a life of sameness and predictability,
he was awed by the surprises that lay b

ke it very far before
he stumbled and fell forward.

on his knees, unable to rise, jonas tried a second time. his
consciousness grasped at a wisp of another warm memory, and
tried desperately to hold it there, to enlarge it, and pass it into
gabriel. his spirits and strength lifted with the momentary warmth
and he stood. again, gabriel stirred against him as he began to
climb.

but the memory faded, leaving him colder than before. if only he
had had time to receive more warmth from the giver before he


escaped! maybe there would be more left for him now. but there
was no purpose in if-onlys. his entire concentration now had to be
on moving his feet, warming gabriel and himself, and going
forward.

he climbed, stopped, and warmed them both briefly again, with a
tiny scrap of memory that seemed certainly to be all he had left.

the top of the hill seemed so far away, and he did not know what
lay beyond. but there was nothing left to do but continue. he
trudged upward.

as he approac
 
 ___________________________
 
hed the summit of the hill at last, something began to
happen. he was not warmer; if anything, he felt more numb and
more cold. he was not less exhausted; on the contrary, his steps
were leaden, and he could barely move his freezing, tired legs.

but he began, suddenly, to feel happy. he began to recall happy
times. he remembered his parents and his sister. he remembered
his friends, asher and fiona. he remembered the giver.

memories of joy flooded through him suddenly.

he reached the place where the hill crested and he could feel the
ground under his snow-covered feet become level. it would not be
uphill anymore.

"we're almost there, gabriel," he whispered, feeling quite certain
without knowing why. "i remember this place, gabe." and it was
true. but it was not a grasping of a thin and burdensome
recollection; this was different. this was something that he could
keep. it was a memory of his own.



he hugged g
