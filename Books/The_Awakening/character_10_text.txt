nd whistling birds were still at it. two young girls,
the farival twins, were playing a duet from “zampa” upon the piano.
madame lebrun was bustling in and out, giving orders in a high key to a
yard-boy whenever she got inside the house, and directions in an equally
high voice to a dining-room servant whenever she got outside. she was
a fresh, pretty woman, clad always in white with elbow sleeves. her
starched skirts crinkled as she came and went. farther down, before
one of the cottages, a lady in black was walking demurely up and down,
telling her beads. a good many persons of the pension had gone over to
the cheniere caminada in beaudelet’s lugger to hear mass. some young
people were out under the wateroaks playing croquet. mr. pontellier’s
two children were there--sturdy little fellows of four and five. a
quadroon nurse followed them about with a faraway, meditative air.

mr. pontellier finally lit a cigar and began to smoke, letting the paper
drag idly from his hand. he fixed his gaze

it was very warm, and for a while they did nothing but exchange remarks
about the heat, the sun, the glare. but there was a breeze blowing, a
choppy, stiff wind that whipped the water into froth. it fluttered the
skirts of the two women and kept them for a while engaged in adjusting,
readjusting, tucking in, securing hair-pins and hat-pins. a few persons
were sporting some distance away in the water. the beach was very still
of human sound at that hour. the lady in black was reading her morning
devotions on the porch of a neighboring bathhouse. two young lovers were
exchanging their hearts’ yearnings beneath the children’s tent, which
they had found unoccupied.

edna pontellier, casting her eyes about, had finally kept them at rest
upon the sea. the day was clear and carried the gaze out as far as the
blue sky went; there were a few white clouds suspended idly over the
horizon. a lateen sail was visible in the direction of cat island, and
others to the sout

ust a bare, white arm from the curtain which shielded her open
door, and received the cup from his hands. she told him he was a bon
garcon, and she meant it. robert thanked her and turned away toward “the
house.”

the lovers were just entering the grounds of the pension. they were
leaning toward each other as the wateroaks bent from the sea. there was
not a particle of earth beneath their feet. their heads might have been
turned upside-down, so absolutely did they tread upon blue ether. the
lady in black, creeping behind them, looked a trifle paler and more
jaded than usual. there was no sign of mrs. pontellier and the children.
robert scanned the distance for any such apparition. they would
doubtless remain away till the dinner hour. the young man ascended to
his mother’s room. it was situated at the top of the house, made up of
odd angles and a queer, sloping ceiling. two broad dormer windows looked
out toward the gulf, and as far across it as a man’s eye might reach.

ties. however,
she was not seeking refreshment or help from any source, either external
or from within. she was blindly following whatever impulse moved her,
as if she had placed herself in alien hands for direction, and freed her
soul of responsibility.

most of the people at that early hour were still in bed and asleep.
a few, who intended to go over to the cheniere for mass, were moving
about. the lovers, who had laid their plans the night before, were
already strolling toward the wharf. the lady in black, with her sunday
prayer-book, velvet and gold-clasped, and her sunday silver beads, was
following them at no great distance. old monsieur farival was up, and
was more than half inclined to do anything that suggested itself. he
put on his big straw hat, and taking his umbrella from the stand in the
hall, followed the lady in black, never overtaking her.

the little negro girl who worked madame lebrun’s sewing-machine was
sweeping the galleries with long, absent-minded strokes of the broom.

e nor of anything. he told her he had often
noticed that she lacked forethought.

“wasn’t it enough to think of going to the cheniere and waking you up?”
 she laughed. “do i have to think of everything?--as leonce says when
he’s in a bad humor. i don’t blame him; he’d never be in a bad humor if
it weren’t for me.”

they took a short cut across the sands. at a distance they could see
the curious procession moving toward the wharf--the lovers, shoulder to
shoulder, creeping; the lady in black, gaining steadily upon them; old
monsieur farival, losing ground inch by inch, and a young barefooted
spanish girl, with a red kerchief on her head and a basket on her arm,
bringing up the rear.

robert knew the girl, and he talked to her a little in the boat. no one
present understood what they said. her name was mariequita. she had a
round, sly, piquant face and pretty black eyes. her hands were small,
and she kept them folded over the handle of her basket. her feet were
broad and coarse. she

equita was there, taking up so much room.
in reality he was annoyed at having old monsieur farival, who considered
himself the better sailor of the two. but he would not quarrel with
so old a man as monsieur farival, so he quarreled with mariequita. the
girl was deprecatory at one moment, appealing to robert. she was saucy
the next, moving her head up and down, making “eyes” at robert and
making “mouths” at beaudelet.

the lovers were all alone. they saw nothing, they heard nothing. the
lady in black was counting her beads for the third time. old monsieur
farival talked incessantly of what he knew about handling a boat, and of
what beaudelet did not know on the same subject.

edna liked it all. she looked mariequita up and down, from her ugly
brown toes to her pretty black eyes, and back again.

“why does she look at me like that?” inquired the girl of robert.

“maybe she thinks you are pretty. shall i ask her?”

“no. is she your sweetheart?”

“she’s a married lady, and has

justice.

“at four o’clock this afternoon, monsieur farival,” robert replied, in
a high voice and with a lofty air, which reminded edna of some gentleman
on the stage.

she had forced herself to eat most of her soup, and now she was picking
the flaky bits of a court bouillon with her fork.

the lovers were profiting by the general conversation on mexico to speak
in whispers of matters which they rightly considered were interesting
to no one but themselves. the lady in black had once received a pair
of prayer-beads of curious workmanship from mexico, with very special
indulgence attached to them, but she had never been able to ascertain
whether the indulgence extended outside the mexican border. father
fochel of the cathedral had attempted to explain it; but he had not
done so to her satisfaction. and she begged that robert would interest
himself, and discover, if possible, whether she was entitled to the
indulgence accompanying the remarkably curious mexican praye
