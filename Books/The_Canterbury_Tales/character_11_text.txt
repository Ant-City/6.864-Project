ace the composition of chaucer's a. b. c., or the prayer
of our lady, made at the request of the duchess blanche, a
lady of great devoutness in her private life. she died in 1369;
and chaucer, as he had allegorised her wooing, celebrated her
marriage, and aided her devotions, now lamented her death, in a
poem entitled "the book of the duchess; or, the death of
blanche.<3>

in 1370, chaucer was employed on the king's service abroad;
and in november 1372, by the title of "scutifer noster" -- our
esquire or shield-bearer -- he was associated with "jacobus
pronan," and "johannes de mari civis januensis," in a royal
commission, bestowing full powers to treat with the duke of
genoa, his council, and state.  the object of the embassy was
to negotiate upon the choice of an english port at which the
genoese might form a commercial establishment; and chaucer,
having quitted england in december, visited genoa and
florence, and returned to england before the end of november
1373 -- for on that day he dr

only our present information; but fancy loves to dwell on the
thought of the two poets conversing under the vines at arqua;
and we find in the history and the writings of chaucer nothing
to contradict, a good deal to countenance, the belief that such a
meeting occurred.

though we have no express record, we have indirect testimony,
that chaucer's genoese mission was discharged satisfactorily;
for on the 23d of april 1374, edward iii grants at windsor to
the poet, by the title of "our beloved squire" -- dilecto armigero
nostro -- unum pycher. vini, "one pitcher of wine" daily, to be
"perceived" in the port of london; a grant which, on the
analogy of more modern usage, might he held equivalent to
chaucer's appointment as poet laureate. when we find that
soon afterwards the grant was commuted for a money payment
of twenty marks per annum, we need not conclude that
chaucer's circumstances were poor; for it may be easily
supposed that the daily "perception" of such an article of
income was att

notes to the prologue to the wife of bath's tale


1. among the evidences that chaucer's great work was left
incomplete, is the absence of any link of connexion between the
wife of bath's prologue and tale, and what goes before. this
deficiency has in some editions caused the squire's and the
merchant's tales to be interposed between those of the man of
law and the wife of bath; but in the merchant's tale there is
internal proof that it was told after the jolly dame's.  several
manuscripts contain verses designed to serve as a connexion;
but they are evidently not chaucer's, and it is unnecessary to
give them here. of this prologue, which may fairly be regarded
as a distinct autobiographical tale, tyrwhitt says: "the
extraordinary length of it, as well as the vein of pleas

but yet he feigned as he were not so;

1. at this point, and again some twenty lines below, several
verses of a very coarse character had been inserted in later
manuscripts; but they are evidently spurious, and are omitted in
the best editions.

32. "store" is the general reading here, but its meaning is not
obvious.  "stowre" is found in several manuscripts; it signifies
"struggle" or "resist;" and both for its own appropriateness, and
for the force which it gives the word "stronge," the reading in
the text seems the better.

notes to the squire's tale


1. the squire's tale has not been found under any other form
among the literary remains of the middle ages; and it is
unknown from what original it was derived, if from any. the
tale is unfinished, not because the conclusion has been lost, but
because the author left it so.

2. the russians and tartars waged constant hostilities between
the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries.

3. in the best manuscripts the name is "cambynskan," and thus,
no doubt, it should strictly be read. but it is

 namesake of the camballo
who was canace's brother -- which is not at all probable -- we
must agree with tyrwhitt that there is a mistake here; which no
doubt chaucer would have rectified, if the tale had not been
"left half-told," one manuscript reads "caballo;" and though not
much authority need be given to a difference that may be due to
mere omission of the mark of contraction over the "a," there is
enough in the text to show that another person than the king's
younger son is intended.  the squire promises to tell the
adventures that befell each member of cambuscan's family; and
in thorough consistency with this plan, and with the canons of
chivalric story, would be "the marriage of canace to some
knight who was first obliged to fight for her with her two
brethren; a method of courtship," adds tyrwhitt, "very
consonant to the spirit of ancient chivalry."

38. (trancriber's note) in some manuscripts the following two
lines, being the beginning of the third part, are found: -

notes to the prologue to the shipman's tale


1. the prologue here given was transferred by tyrwhitt from
the place, preceding the squire's tale, which it had formerly
occupied; the shipman's tale having no prologue in the best
manuscripts.

2. lollard: a contemptuous name for the followers of
wyckliffe; presumably derived from the latin, "lolium," tares,
as if they were the tares among the lord's wheat; so, a few lines
below, the shipman intimates his fear lest the parson should
"spring cockle in our clean corn."

3. cockle: a weed, the "agrostemma githago" of linnaeus;
perhaps named from the anglo-saxon, "ceocan," because it

describe "sighs" and other tokens of grief, and "cares" or
"anxieties."

23. undern:  in this case, the meaning of "evening" or
"afternoon" can hardly be applied to the word, which must be
taken to signify some early hour of the forenoon. see also note
4 to the wife of bath's tale and note 5 to the clerk's tale.

24. ganilion: a traitor.  see note 9 to the shipman's tale and
note 28 to the monk's tale.

25. greek sinon: the inventor of the trojan horse. see note 14
to the squire's tale

26. boult it from the bren: examine the matter thoroughly; a
metaphor taken from the sifting of meal, to divide the fine flour
from the bran.

thirteenth century, who wrote a book, "de causa dei," in
controversy with pelagius; and also numerous other treatises,
among them some  on predestination.

notes to the manciple's tale


1. "the fable of 'the crow,' says tyrwhitt, "which is the
subject of the manciple's tale, has been related by so many
authors, from ovid down to gower, that it is impossible to
say whom chaucer principally followed. his skill in new
dressing an old story was never, perhaps, more successfully
exerted."

2. see the parallel to this passage in the squire's tale, and
note 34 to that tale.

3. wantrust: distrust -- want of trust; so "wanhope," despair -
- want of hope.

4. this is quoted in the french "romance of the rose," from
cato "de moribus," 1. i., dist. 3: "virtutem primam esse puta
compescere linguam." ("the first virtue is to be able to
control the tongue")

5. "semel emissum volat irrevocabile verbum." ("a word once
uttered flies away and cannot be called back")   -- horace,
epist. 1., 18, 71.

18. tabernacle: a shrine or canopy of stone, supported by
pillars.

19. mister folk:  handicraftsmen, or tradesmen, who have
learned "mysteries."

20. the loves "of queen annelida and false arcite" formed the
subject of a short unfinished poem by chaucer, which was
afterwards worked up into the knight's tale.

21. blue was the colour of truth. see note 36 to the squire's
tale.

22. blife: quickly, eagerly; for "blive" or "belive."

23. it will be seen afterwards that philogenet does not relish it,
and pleads for its relaxation.

24. feat: dainty, neat, handsome; the same as "fetis," oftener
used in chaucer; the adverb "featly" is still used, as applied to
dancing, &c.

25. solomon was beguiled by his heathenish wives to forsake
the worship of the true god; samson fell a victim to the wiles of

68. lucan, in his "pharsalia," a poem in ten books, recounted
the incidents of the war between caesar and pompey.

69. claudian of alexandria, "the most modern of the ancient
poets," lived some three centuries after christ, and among other
works wrote three books on "the rape of proserpine."

70. triton was a son of poseidon or neptune, and represented
usually as blowing a trumpet made of a conch or shell; he is
therefore introduced by chaucer as the squire of aeolus.

71. sky: cloud; anglo-saxon, "scua;" greek, "skia."

72. los: reputation. see note 5 to chaucer's tale of meliboeus.

73. swart: black; german, "schwarz."

74. tewell: the pipe, chimney, of the furnace; french "tuyau."
in the prologue to the canterbury tales, the monk's head is
described as steaming like a lead furnace.

75. tetches: blemishes, spots; french, "tache."

76. for the story of belle isaude see note 21 to the assembly of
fowls.

answer one word for shame (at the stratagem that brought
cressida to implore his protection)

40. "all n'ere he malapert, nor made avow
     nor was so bold to sing a foole's mass;"
i.e. although he was not over-forward and made no confession
(of his love), or was so bold as to be rash and ill-advised in his
declarations of love and worship.

41. pandarus wept as if he would turn to water; so, in the
squire's tale, did canace weep for the woes of the falcon.

42. if i breake your defence: if i transgress in whatever you may
forbid; french, "defendre," to prohibit.

43. these lines and the succeeding stanza are addressed to
pandarus, who had interposed some words of incitement to
cressida.

"his ancestry of kin was to lier; and the stanza in which that

55. for the force of "cold," see note 22 to the nun's priest's
tale.

56. goddes seven:  the divinities who gave their names to the
seven planets, which, in association with the seven metals, are
mentioned in the canon's yeoman's tale.

57. assayed:  experienced, tasted. see note 6 to the squire's
tale.

58. now is it better than both two were lorn: better this happy
issue, than that both two should be lost (through the sorrow of
fruitless love).

59. made him such feast: french, "lui fit fete" -- made holiday
for him.

60. the cock is called, in "the assembly of fowls," "the
horologe of thorpes lite;" [the clock of little villages] and in the

5. the ships had  high embattled poops and forecastles, as in
mediaeval ships of war.

6. compare spenser's account of phaedria's barque, in "the
faerie queen," canto vi. book ii.; and, mutatis mutandis,
chaucer's description of the wondrous horse, in the squire's
tale.

7. salad: a small helmet; french, "salade."

8. gardebrace: french, "garde-bras," an arm-shield; probably
resembling the "gay bracer" which the yeoman, in the prologue
to the canterbury tales, wears on his arm.

9. confession and prayer were the usual preliminaries of any
enterprise in those superstitious days; and in these days of
enlightenment the fashion yet lingers among the most
