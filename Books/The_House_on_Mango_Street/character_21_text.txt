t  finally  we 
agree to  ride  it  together.  why  not? 

because  lucy  has  long  lew;  she  pedals.  i  sit  on  the 

our good day 

if you  give  me  five  dollars  i  will  be your friend  for­

ever.  that's what the little one tells  me. 

five  dollars  is  cheap  since  i  don't  have  any  friends 

except cathy who is  only  my  friend  till  tuesday. 

five  dollars,  five  dollars. 
she  is  trying  to get  somehody  to  chip in  so  they can 
huy a  hicycle from this kid  named tito. they already have 
ten dollars and all  they  need  is  five  more. 

only five  dollars, she says. 
don', talk to them, says cathy. can't you see they smell 

like a  hroom. 

but  i  like  them.  their clothes  are  crooked  and  old.

  i had even 
gone to  the  social  security office  the  month before to  get 
my social security number.  i needed money. the catholic 
high school cost a lot, and papa said nobody went to public 
school unless you wanted to turn out bad. 

i  thought  i'd  find  an  easy  job,  the  kind  other  kids 
had, working in the dime store or maybe a  hotdog stand. 
and though i hadn't started looking yet, i thought i might 
the week after next. but when i came home that afternoon, 
all  wet because tito had  pushed  me  into  the  open water 
hydrant-only i  had sort of let him-mama called me in 
the kitchen before i could even go and change, and aunt

we could be friends and next time to go in the lunchroom 
and sit with him, and i  felt better. he had nice eyes and 1

who  wears  tight  pink  pants  and  green  glasses.  we  never 
agree on what she looks like, but we do know  this.  when­
ever  she  arrives,  he  holds  her  tight  by  the  crook of the 
arm.  they  walk  fast  into  the  apartment,  lock  the  door 
behind them and never stay long. 

the 
earl of 
tennessee 

earl  lives  next door in edna's  basement,  behind  the 
flower boxes edna paints green each year, behind the dusty 
geraniums. we used to sit on the flower boxes until the day 
tito saw a cockroach with a spot of green paint on its head. 
now  we  sit  on  the steps  that swing around  the  basement 
apartment where earl lives. 

earl works nights. his blinds are always closed during 
the day. sometimes he comes out and tells us to keep quiet. 
the little wooden door that has wedged shut the dark for 
so  long  opens  with  a  sigh  and  lets  out  a  breath  of mold 
and  dampness,  like  books  that  have  been  left  out  in  the 
rain.  this is  the only time we  see e

 where i  tried one 
day  but  not even the  monkey  garden would  have  me.  it 
was  the last day  i  would go there. 

who was it that said i  was getting too old to play the 
games? who was it i didn't listen to? i only remember that 
when  the  others  ran,  i  wanted  to  run  too,  up and down 
and through the monkey garden, fast as the boys, not like 
sally  who screamed if she got her stockings muddy. 

i  said,  sally,  come on,  but she  wouldn't.  she stayed 
by  the curb talking to tito and his  friends.  play  with  the 
kids  if you want,  she said,  i'm staying here. she could be 
stuck-up like  that if she wanted to,  so i just left. 

i t  was  her own fault  too.  when i  got back sally  was 
pretending to be mad ... something about the boys having 
stolen  her  keys.  please  give  them  back  to  me,  she  said 
punching the nearest one with a soft fist. they were laugh­
ing.  she was  too.  it was a joke i  didn't get. 

i wanted to go back with the other kids who we

jumping on cars, still chasing each other through the gar­
den, but sally  had her own game. 

one  of the  boys  invented  the  rules.  one  of tito's 
friends  said you can't get the keys back unless you  kiss  us 
and sally  pretended to be  mad at first  but she said yes.  it 
was  that simple. 

i  don't know  why,  but something inside  me  wanted 
to  throw  a  stick.  something  wanted  to  say  no  when  i 
watched sally going into the garden with tito's buddies all 

grinning. it was just a  kiss,  that's all.  a  li.ss  for each  0de­
s<>  what, she said, 

only  how  come  i  felt  angry  inside.  like  something 
wasn't right. sally went behind that old blue pickup to usa 
the boys and get her keys back, and i  ran up three flights 
of stairs to where tito lived. his mother was ironing shirts. 
she was sprinkling water on them from an empty pop botde 
and smoking a cigarette. 

your son and  his  friends  stole  sally's  keys  and  now
