[CHARACTER] - 
                	the
daughter of duke senior. [CHARACTER], considered one of shakespeare's
most delightful heroines, is independent minded, strong-willed,
good-hearted, and terribly clever. rather than slink off into defeated
exile, [CHARACTER] resourcefully uses her trip to the forest of ardenne
as an opportunity to take control of her own destiny. when she disguises
herself as ganymede--a handsome young man--and offers herself as a
tutor in the ways of love to her beloved orlando, [CHARACTER]'s talents
and charms are on full display. only [CHARACTER], for instance, is
both aware of the foolishness of romantic love and delighted
to be in love. she teaches those around her to think, feel, and
love better than they have previously, and she ensures that the
courtiers returning from ardenne are far gentler than those who fled
to it.
