Helena
Although Puck and Bottom stand out as the most personable
characters in A Midsummer Night's Dream, they themselves
are not involved in the main dramatic events. Of the other characters,
Helena, the lovesick young woman desperately in love with Demetrius, is
perhaps the most fully drawn. Among the quartet of Athenian lovers,
Helena is the one who thinks most about the nature of love--which
makes sense, given that at the beginning of the play she is left out
of the love triangle involving Lysander, Hermia, and Demetrius. She
says, "Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind," believing
that Demetrius has built up a fantastic notion of Hermia's beauty
that prevents him from recognizing Helena's own beauty (I.i.234).
Utterly faithful to Demetrius despite her recognition of his shortcomings,
Helena sets out to win his love by telling him about the plan of
Lysander and Hermia to elope into the forest. Once Helena enters
the forest, many of her traits are drawn out by the confusion that
the love potion engenders: compared to the other lovers, she is
extremely unsure of herself, worrying about her appearance and believing
that Lysander is mocking her when he declares his love for her.
