Enkidu - 
                    Companion
and friend of Gilgamesh. Hairy-bodied and brawny, Enkidu was raised
by animals. Even after he joins the civilized world, he retains
many of his undomesticated characteristics. Enkidu looks
much like Gilgamesh and is almost his physical
equal. He aspires to be Gilgamesh's rival but instead becomes his soul
mate. The gods punish Gilgamesh and Enkidu by giving Enkidu a slow,
painful, inglorious death for killing the demon Humbaba and the
Bull of Heaven.
