[CHARACTER] - 
                okonkwo's
father, of whom okonkwo has been ashamed since childhood. by the
standards of the clan, [CHARACTER] was a coward and a spendthrift. he
never took a title in his life, he borrowed money from his clansmen,
and he rarely repaid his debts. he never became a warrior because
he feared the sight of blood. moreover, he died of an abominable
illness. on the positive side, [CHARACTER] appears to have been a talented musician
and gentle, if idle. he may well have been a dreamer, ill-suited
to the chauvinistic culture into which he was born. the novel opens
ten years after his death.
