the [CHARACTER]  - 
      the personified quasi-divinities who bring rain and thunder. the [CHARACTER] acts as a core voice in the play, explaining certain motives and egging on the action. at times, they act as prophets, foreshadowing actions and obstacles to come. the [CHARACTER] can interact directly with the audience and thus may seem to be removed from the action of the scene, much like the gods the chorus is supposed to be replacing. the chorus' prescience and sense of resolve makes its members obvious candidates for divinity; with their singing and dancing en masse they lend the necessary air of ritual and spirituality. also, because the chorus members speak directly to the audience about the play and about playwriting itself, they become mouthpieces for aristophanes himself.
