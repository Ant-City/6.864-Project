ud, iâ€™d need 
water . . . 
i pull on my gear, grab my spit, kick some dirt over the 
coals, and take off in the opposite direction the careers went. i 
eat half the rabbit as i go, then wrap up the leftovers in my 
plastic for later. the meat stops the grumbling in my stomach 
but does little to quench my thirst. water is my top priority 
now. as i hike along, i feel certain iâ€™m still holding the screen in 
the capitol, so iâ€™m careful to continue to hide my emotions. 
but what a good time claudius templesmith must be having 
with his guest commentators, dissecting peetaâ€™s behavior, my 
reaction. what to make of it all? has peeta revealed his true 
colors? how does this affect the betting odds? will we lose 
sponsors? do we even have sponsors? yes, i feel certain we 
do, or at least did. 
certainly peeta has thrown a wrench into our star-crossed 
lover dynamic. or has he? maybe, since he hasnâ€™t spoken much 
about me, we can still get some mileage out of it. maybe 
people will think itâ€™s somethi

nally, there will be trumpets followed by an announcement. 
usually, this will be a call to a feast. when food is scarce, the 
gamemakers will invite the players to a banquet, somewhere 
known to all like the cornucopia, as an inducement to gather

and fight. sometimes there is a feast and sometimes thereâ€™s 
nothing but a loaf of stale bread for the tributes to compete 
for. i wouldnâ€™t go in for the food, but this could be an ideal 
time to take out a few competitors. 
claudius templesmithâ€™s voice booms down from overhead, 
congratulating the six of us who remain. but he is not inviting 
us to a feast. heâ€™s saying something very confusing. thereâ€™s 
been a rule change in the games. a rule change! that in itself 
is mind bending since we donâ€™t really have any rules to speak 
of except donâ€™t step off your circle for sixty seconds and the 
unspoken rule about not eating one another. under the new 
rule, both tributes from the same district will be declared 
winners if they

ter you saved its 
life,â€ says peeta. â€œi intend to do the same thing.â€ 
â€œreally? what did you cost me again?â€ i ask. 
â€œa lot of trouble. donâ€™t worry. youâ€™ll get it all back,â€ he says. 
â€œyouâ€™re not making sense,â€ i say. i test his forehead. the 
leverâ€™s going nowhere but up. â€œyouâ€™re a little cooler though.â€ 
the sound of the trumpets startles me. iâ€™m on my feet and 
at the mouth of the cave in a flash, not wanting to miss a sylla-
ble. itâ€™s my new best friend, claudius templesmith, and as i 
expected, heâ€™s inviting us to a feast. well, weâ€™re not that hun-
gry and i actually wave his offer away in indifference when he 
says, â€œnow hold on. some of you may already be declining my 
invitation. but this is no ordinary feast. each of you needs 
something desperately.â€ 
i do need something desperately. something to heal peetaâ€™s 
leg. â€œeach of you will find that something in a backpack, marked 
with your district number, at the cornucopia at dawn. think 
hard about r

style or her forte. sheâ€™s even smaller than i am and unarmed, 
unless sheâ€™s picked up some weapons recently. sheâ€™ll probably 
be hanging somewhere nearby, seeing what she can scavenge. 
but the other three . . . iâ€™m going to have my hands full. my 
ability to kill at a distance is my greatest asset, but i know iâ€™ll 
have to go right into the thick of things to get that backpack, 
the one with the number 12 on it that claudius templesmith 
mentioned. 
i watch the sky, hoping for one less opponent at dawn, but 
nobody appears tonight. tomorrow there will be faces up 
there. feasts always result in fatalities. 
i crawl into the cave, secure my glasses, and curl up next to 
peeta. luckily i had that good long sleep today. i have to stay 
awake. i donâ€™t really think anyone will attack our cave tonight, 
but i canâ€™t risk missing the dawn. 
so cold, so bitterly cold tonight. as if the gamemakers have

guished themselves either by strength or deadliness or cun-
ning. do they suppose, i wonder, that i have peeta with me? i 
doubt foxface and thresh even know he was wounded. all the 
better if they think heâ€™s covering me when i go in for the 
backpack. 
but where is it? the arena has lightened enough for me to 
remove my glasses. i can hear the morning birds singing. isnâ€™t 
it time? for a second, iâ€™m panicked that iâ€™m at the wrong loca-
tion. but no, iâ€™m certain i remember claudius templesmith 
specifying the cornucopia. and there it is. and here i am. so 
whereâ€™s my feast? 
just as the first ray of sun glints off the gold cornucopia, 
thereâ€™s a disturbance on the plain. the ground before the 
mouth of the horn splits in two and a round table with a 
snowy white cloth rises into the arena. on the table sit four

but again thereâ€™s no response. 
â€œwhat are they waiting for?â€ says peeta weakly. between 
the loss of the tourniquet and the effort it took to get to the 
lake, his wound has opened up again. 
â€œi donâ€™t know,â€ i say. whatever the holdup is, i canâ€™t watch 
him lose any more blood. i get up to find a stick but almost

immediately come across the arrow that bounced off catoâ€™s 
body armor. it will do as well as the other arrow. as i stoop to 
pick it up, claudius templesmithâ€™s voice booms into the arena. 
â€œgreetings to the final contestants of the seventy-fourth 
hunger games. the earlier revision has been revoked. closer 
examination of the rule book has disclosed that only one win-
ner may be allowed,â€ he says. â€œgood luck and may the odds be 
ever in your favor.â€ 
thereâ€™s a small burst of static and then nothing more. i 
stare at peeta in disbelief as the truth sinks in. they never in-
tended to let us both live. this has all been devised by the ga-

œhold them out. i want everyone to see,â€ he says. 
i spread out my fingers, and the dark berries glisten in the 
sun. i give peetaâ€™s hand one last squeeze as a signal, as a good-
bye, and we begin counting. â€œone.â€ maybe iâ€™m wrong. â€œtwo.â€ 
maybe they donâ€™t care if we both die. â€œthree!â€ itâ€™s too late to 
change my mind. i lift my hand to my mouth, taking one last 
look at the world. the berries have just passed my lips when 
the trumpets begin to blare. 
the frantic voice of claudius templesmith shouts above 
them. â€œstop! stop! ladies and gentlemen, i am pleased to 
present the victors of the seventy-fourth hunger games, kat-
niss everdeen and peeta mellark! i give you â€” the tributes of 
district twelve!â€

  i spew the berries from my mouth, wiping my tongue with 
the end of my shirt to make sure no juice remains. peeta pulls 
me to the lake where we both flush our mouths with water 
and then collapse into each otherâ€™s arms. 
â€œyou didnâ€™t swallow any?â€ i a
