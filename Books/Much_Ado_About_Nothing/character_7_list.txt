Margaret - 
                Hero's
serving woman, who unwittingly helps Borachio and Don John deceive
Claudio into thinking that Hero is unfaithful. Unlike Ursula, Hero's
other lady-in-waiting, Margaret is lower class. Though she is honest,
she does have some dealings with the villainous world of Don John:
her lover is the mistrustful and easily bribed Borachio. Also unlike
Ursula, Margaret loves to break decorum, especially with bawdy jokes and
teases.
