joad's grandfather. the founder of the joad farm, grampa is now
old and infirm. once possessed of a cruel and violent temper, grampa's
wickedness is now limited almost exclusively to his tongue. he delights
in tormenting his wife and shocking others with sinful talk. although
his character serves largely to produce comical effect, he exhibits
a very real and poignant connection to the land. the family is forced
to drug him in order to get him to leave the homestead; removed
from his natural element, however, grampa soon dies.
