The Spider Woman - 
                A freak-show attraction who visits the village. Punished for the sin of disobeying her parents, the spider woman now has the body of an enormous spider and the head of a sad young woman. The clear moral of the woman's story draws gawking villagers away from the old man, who is unable to offer the crowds such a compelling narrative.
