[CHARACTER]
although dennis died while ruth was pregnant with james, he is a palpable force in the lives of both james and ruth. a strong, kind man from north carolina, dennis provided the stability and faith ruth needed after a difficult early life with her parents and harsh beginnings in new york city. he was a violinist with an incredible passion about music, a passion that james's musical tendencies would later echo. he gently guided ruth toward an acceptance of the christian faith. ruth describes dennis glowingly, and we sense that theirs was a true love.
