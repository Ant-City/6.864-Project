jewel and i come up from the field, following the path in single file. although 

i am fifteen feet ahead of him, anyone watching us from the cottonhouse can see 

jewel's frayed and broken straw hat a full head above my own. 

the path runs straight as a plumb-line, worn smooth by feet and baked 

brick-hard by july, between the green rows of laid-by cotton, to the cottonhouse 

in the center of the field, where it turns and circles the cottonhouse at four 

soft right angles and goes on across the field again, worn so by feet in fading 

precision. 

the cottonhouse is of rough logs, from between which the chinking has long 
fallen. square, with a broken roof

 set at a single pitch, it leans in empty and

walls giving onto the approaches of the path. when we reach it i turn and follow 
the path which circles the house. jewel, fifteen feet behind me, looking 
straight ahead, steps in a single stride through the window. still staring 
straight ahead, his pale eyes like wood set into his wooden face, he crosses the 
floor in four strides with the rigid gravity of a cigar store indian dressed in 
patched overalls and endued with life from the hips down, and steps in a single 
stride through the opposite window and into the path again just as i come around 
the corner. in single file and five feet apart and jewel now in

tull's wagon stands beside the spring, hitched to the rail, the reins 

wrapped about the seat stanchion. in the wagon bed are two chairs. jewel stops 

at the spring and takes the gourd from the willow branch and drinks. i pass him 

and mount the path, beginning to hear cash's saw. 

when i reach the top he has quit sawing. standing in a litter of chips, he 

is fitting two of the boards together. between the shadow spaces they are yellow 

as gold, like soft gold, bearing on their flanks in smooth undulations the marks 

of the adze blade: a good carpenter, cash is. he holds the two planks on the 

trestle, fitted along the edges in

pa and vernon are sitting on the back porch. pa is tilting snuff from the lid of 
his snuff-box into his lower lip, holding the lip outdrawn between thumb and 
finger. they look around as i cross the porch and dip the gourd into the water 
bucket and drink. 

"where's jewel?" pa says. when i was a boy i first learned how much better 
water tastes when it has set a while in a cedar bucket. warmish-cool, with a 
faint taste like the hot july wind in cedar trees smells. it has to set at least 
six hours, and be drunk from a gourd. water should never be drunk from metal. 
and at night it is better still. i used to lie on the pallet in the hall, 
waiting until i could hear them all asleep, so i could get up and go back to the 
bucket. it would be black, the shelf black

i have never seen him go to town in overalls. his wife, they say. she taught 
school too, once. 

i fling the dipper dregs to the ground and wipe my mouth on my sleeve. it 
is going to rain before morning. maybe before dark. "down to the barn," i say. 
"harnessing the team." 

down there fooling with that horse. he will go on through the barn, into 
the pasture. the horse will not be in sight: he is up there among the pine 
seedlings, in the cool. jewel whistles, once and shrill. the horse snorts, then 
jewel sees him, glinting for a gaudy instant among the blue shadows. jewel 
whistles again; the horse comes dropping down the slope, stiff-legged, his ears 
cocking and flicking, his mis-matched eyes rolling, and fetches up twenty feet 



away, broadside on, watching jewel over his shoulder in an attitude kittenish 
and alert. 

"come here, sir," jewel says. he moves. moving that quick his coat, 
bunching, tongues swirling like so many flames.

 with tossing mane and tail and 
rolling eye the horse makes another short curvetting rush and stops again, feet 
bunched, watching jewel. jewel walks steadily toward him, his hands at his 
sides. save for jewel's legs they are like two figures carved for a tableau 
savage in the sun. 

when jewel can almost touch him, the horse stands on his hind legs and 

slashes down at jewel. then jewel is enclosed by a glittering maze of hooves as 

by an illusion of wings; among them, beneath the up-reared chest, he moves with 

the flashing limberness of a snake. for an instant before the jerk comes onto 

his arms he sees his whole body earth-free, horizontal, whipping snake-umber, 

until he finds the horse's nostrils and touches earth again. then they are 

rigid, motionless, terrific, the horse back-thrust on stiffened, quivering legs, 

with lowered head; jewel with dug heels, shutting

 off the horse's wind with one 

hand, with the other patting the horse's neck in short strokes myriad and 

caressing, cursing the horse with obscene ferocity. 

they stand in rigid terrific hiatus, the horse trembling and groaning. 

then jewel is on the horse's back. he flows upward in a stooping swirl like the 

lash of a whip, his body in midair shaped to the horse. for another moment the 

horse stands spraddled, with lowered head, before it bursts into motion. they 

descend the hill in a series of spine-jolting jumps, jewel high, leech-like on 

the withers, to the fence where the horse bunches to a scuttering halt again. 

"well," jewel says, "you can quit now, if you got a-plenty." 

inside the barn jewel slides running to the

 ground before the horse stops. 

the horse enters the stall, jewel following. without looking back the horse 

kicks at him, slamming a single hoof into the wall with a pistol-like report. 

jewel kicks him in the stomach; the horse arches his neck back, crop-toothed; 

jewel strikes him across the face with his fist and slides on to the trough and 

mounts upon it. clinging to the hay-rack he lowers his head and peers out across 

the stall tops and through the doorway. the path is empty; from here he cannot 

even hear cash sawing. he reaches up and drags down hay in hurried armsful and 

crams it into the rack. 

"eat," he says. "get the goddamn stuff out of sight while you got a 
chance, you pussel-gutted bastard. you sweet son of a bitch," he says.

we watch him come around the corner and mount the steps. he does not look at us. 
"you ready?" he says. 

"if you're hitched up," i say. i say "wait." he stops, looking at pa. 

vernon spits, without moving. he spits with decorous and deliberate precision 

into the pocked dust below the porch. pa rubs his hands slowly on his knees. he 

is gazing out beyond the crest of the bluff, out across the land. jewel watches 

him a moment, then he goes on to the pail and drinks again. 

"i mislike undecision as much as ere a man," pa says. 

"it means three dollars," i say. the shirt across pa's hump is faded 

lighter than the rest of it. there is no sweat stain on his shirt. i have never 

seen a sweat stain on his shirt. he was sick once from working in the sun when 

he was twenty-two years old, and he tells people that if he ever sweats, he will 

die. i suppose he believes it. 

"but if she dont last

"we'll need that three dollars then, sure," i say. he gazes out over the 

land, rubbing his hands on his knees. since he lost his teeth his mouth 

collapses in slow repetition when he dips. the stubble gives his lower face that 

appearance that old dogs have. "you'd better make up your mind soon, so we can 

get there and get a load on before dark," i say. 

"ma aint that sick," jewel says. "shut up, darl." 

"that's right," vernon says. "she seems more like herself today than she 

has in a week. time you and jewel get back, she'll be setting up." 

"you ought to know," jewel says. "you been here often enough looking at 

her. you or your folks." vernon looks at him. jewel's eyes look like pale wood 

in his high-blooded face. he is a head taller than any of the rest of us, always 

was. i told them that's why ma always whipped him and petted him more. because

"shut up, jewel," pa says, but as though he is not listening much. he

"you could borrow the loan of vernon's team and we could catch up with 

you," i say. "if she didn't wait for us." 

"ah, shut your goddamn mouth," jewel says. 

"she'll want to go in ourn," pa says. he rubs his knees. "dont ere a man

"it's laying there, watching cash whittle on that damn . . ." jewel says. 



he says it harshly, savagely, but he does not say the word. like a little boy in 
the dark to flail his courage and suddenly aghast into silence by his own noise. 
"she wanted that like she wants to go in our own wagon," pa says. "she'll 
rest easier for knowing it's a good one, and private. she was ever a private

till everything's ready, till her own good time. and with the roads like they 

are now, it wont take you no time to get her to town."

waiting for her there, she'll be impatient. i promised my word me and the boys 

would get her there quick as mules could walk it, so she could rest quiet." he 

rubs his hands on his knees. "no man ever misliked it more." 

"if everybody wasn't burning hell to get her there," jewel says in that 

harsh, savage voice. "with cash all day long right under the window, hammering 

and sawing at that--" 

"it was her wish," pa says. "you got no affection nor gentleness for her. 
you never had. we would be beholden to no man," he says, "me and her. we have 
never yet been, and she will rest quieter for knowing it and that it was her own

after herself."

"well ..." pa says. he looks out over the land, awry-haired, mouthing the 
snuff slowly against, his gums. 

"come on," jewel says. he goes down the steps. vernon spits neatly into 
the dust. 

"by sundown, now," pa says. "i would not keep her waiting." 
jewel glances back, then he goes on around the house. i enter the hall, 
hearing the voices before i reach the door. tilting a little down the hill, as 
our house does, a breeze draws through the hall all the time, upslanting. a 
feather dropped near the front door will rise and brush along the ceiling, 
slanting backward, until it reaches the down-turning current at the back door: 
so with voices. as you enter the hall, they sound as though they were speaking 
out of the air about your head.

again, that anse bundren was driving him from his mother's death bed, never to 
see her in this world again. i always said darl was different from those others. 
i always said he was the only one of them that had his mother's nature, had any 
natural affection. not that jewel, the one she labored so to bear and coddled 
and petted so and him flinging into tantrums or sulking spells, inventing 
devilment to devil her until i would have trailed him time and time. not him to 
come and tell her goodbye. not him to miss a chance to make that extra three 



dollars at the price of his mother's goodbye kiss. a bundren through and 
through, loving nobody, caring for nothing except how to get something with the 
least amount of work. mr tull says darl asked them to wait. he

selling all those years of self-denial and down-right partialityâ they couldn't 
fool me: mr tull says mrs bundren liked jewel the least of all, but i knew 
better. i knew she was partial to him, to the same quality in him that let her 
put up with anse bundren when mr tull said she ought to poisoned him~for three 
dollars, denying his dying mother the goodbye kiss.

would let her. 

except darl. it was the sweetest thing i ever saw. sometimes i lose faith 



in human nature for a time; i am assailed by doubt. but always the lord restores 
my faith and reveals to me his bounteous love for his creatures. not jewel, the 
one she had always cherished, not him. he was after that three extra dollars. it 
was darl, the one that folks say is queer, lazy, pottering about the place no 
better than anse, with cash a good carpenter and always more building than he 
can get around to, and jewel always doing something that made him some money or 
got him talked about, and that near-naked girl always standing over addie with a 
fan so that every time a body tried to talk to her and cheer her up, would 
answer for her

and his mercy. i saw that with jewel she had just been pretending, but that it 
was between her and darl that the understanding and the true love was. he just 
looked at her, not even coming in where she could see him and get upset, knowing 
that anse was driving him away and he would never see her again. he said 
nothing, just looking at her. 

"what you want, darl?" dewey dell said, not stopping the fan, speaking up 
quick, keeping even him from her. he didn't answer. he just stood and looked at 
his dying mother, his heart too

jewel dont care about anything he is not kin to us in caring, not care-kin. and 
cash like sawing the long hot sad yellow days up into planks and nailing them to 
something. and pa thinks because neighbors will always treat one another that 
way because he has always been too busy letting neighbors do for him to find

eyes gone further than the food and the lamp, full of the land dug out of his

"what you want, darl?" i say. 



"she is going to die," he says. and old turkey-buzzard tull coming to 

watch her die but i can fool them.

"then why are you taking jewel?" i say.

patch cut out of a pair of sunday pants, wore iron-slick. "no man mislikes it 
more than me," he says.

he has been to town this week: the back of his neck is trimmed close, with a 
white line between hair and sunburn like a joint of white bone. he has not once 
looked back.

mule ears, the road vanishes beneath the wagon as though it were a ribbon and 

the front axle were a spool. "do you know she is going to die, jewel?" 



it takes two people to make you, and one people to die. that's how the 
world is going to end.

down behind a bank of black cloud like a topheavy mountain range, like a load of 
cinders dumped over there, and there is no wind. i could hear cash sawing for a

path.

mistake of giving trees roots and giving the anse bundrens he makes feet and

stroking itself again, palm and back, on his thigh. the sound of the saw snores

the cow is standing in the barn door, chewing. when she sees me come into

"i aint a-goin to milk you. i aint a-goin to do nothing for them." 

i hear her turn when i pass. when i turn she is just behind me with her 

sweet, hot, hard breath. 

"didn't i tell you i wouldn't?" 

she nudges me, snuffing. she moans deep inside, her mouth closed. i jerk 
my hand, cursing her like jewel does.

i stoop my hand to the ground and run at her. she jumps back and whirls 



away and stops, watching me. she moans. she goes on. to the path and stands 
there, looking up the path. 

it is dark in the barn, warm, smelling, silent. i can cry quietly, 
watching the top of the hill.

"why dont you go on to the house, out of the rain?" cash says. pa looks at 
him, his face streaming slowly. it is as though upon a face carved by a savage 
caricaturist a monstrous "burlesque of all bereavement flowed. "you go on in," 
cash says. "me and vernon can finish it." 

pa looks at item. the sleeves of jewel's coat are too short for him. upon 
his face the rain streams, slow as cold glycerin. "i dont begrudge her the 
wetting," he says. he moves again and falls to shifting the planks, picking them 
up, laying them down again carefully, as though they are glass. he goes to the 
lantern and pulls at the propped raincoat until he knocks it down and cash 
conies and fixes it back.

cash squints at the board. on the long flank of it the rain crashes 

steadily, myriad, fluctuant. "i'm going to bevel it," he says. 

"it'll take more time," vernon says. cash sets the plank on edge; a moment 

longer vernon watches him, then he hands him the plane. 

vernon holds the board steady while cash, bevels the edge of it with the 

tedious and minute care of a jeweler. mrs tull comes to the edge of the porch 

and calls vernon. "how near are you done?" she says. 

vernon does not look up. "not long. some, yet." 

she watches cash stooping at the plank, the turgid savage gleam of the 

lantern slicking on the raincoat as he moves. "you go down and get some planks 

off the barn and finish it and come in out of the rain," she says. "you'll both 

catch your death." vernon does not move. "vernon," she says.

he looks through it like through the visor of a helmet, looking long across the 
valley to where the barn leans against the bluff, shaping the invisible horse.

motionless, wooden-backed, wooden-faced, he shapes the horse in a rigid 
stoop like a hawk, hook-winged. they are waiting for us, ready for the moving of 
it, waiting for him. he enters the stall and waits until it kicks at him so that 
he can slip past and mount onto the trough and pause, peering out across the

with shuffling steps, and through the door.

behind, hobbling to keep up, breathing harshly; then he is distanced and jewel 

carries the entire front end alone, so that, tilting as the path begins to 

slant, it begins to rush away from me and slip down the air like a sled upon 

invisible snow, smoothly evacuating atmosphere in which the sense of it is still 

shaped. 

"wait, jewel," i say. but he will not wait. he is almost running now and 

cash is left behind. it seems to me that the end which i now carry alone has no

he comes up the lane fast, yet we are three hundred yards beyond the mouth of it 
when he turns into the road, the mud flying beneath the flicking drive of the 
hooves. then he slows a little, light and erect in the saddle, the horse mincing 
through the mud. 

tull is in his lot. he looks at us, lifts his hand. we go on, the wagon 
creaking, the mud whispering on the wheels. vernon still stands there. he 
watches jewel as he passes, the horse moving with a light, high-kneed driving 
gait, three hundred yards back. we go on, with a motion so soporific, so 
dreamlike as to be uninferant of progress, as though time and not space were 
decreasing between us and it.

the wagon creaks on. 

cash spits over the wheel. "in a couple of days now it'll be smelling," he 
says. 

"you might tell jewel that," i say. 

he is motionless now, sitting the horse at the function, upright, watching 
us, no less still than the signboard that lifts its fading capitulation opposite 
him. 

"it aint balanced right for no long ride," cash says. 
"tell him that, too," i say. the wagon creaks on.

it was just before sundown. we were sitting on the porch when the wagon came up 
the road with the five of them in it and the other one on the horse behind. one 
of them raised his hand, but they was going on past the store without stopping. 
"who's that?" maccallum says: i cant think of his name: rate's twin; that 
one it was. 



it's bundren, from down beyond new hope," quick says. "there's one of them 
snopes horses jewel's riding." 

"i didn't know there was ere a one of them horses left," maccallum says. 
"i thought you folks down there finally contrived to give them all away." 
"try and get that one," quick says. the wagon went on. 
"i bet old man lon never gave it to him," i says. 

"no," quick says. "he bought it from pappy." the wagon went on. "they must

to drive it into the barn, because it was threatening rain 
again, and that supper was about ready. only they didn't want to come in. 
"i thank you," bundren says. "we wouldn't discommode you. we got a little 
something in the basket. we can make out." 

"well," i says, "since you are so particular about your womenfolks, i am 

too. and when folks stops with us at meal time and wont come to the table, my 

wife takes it as a insult." 

so the girl went on to the kitchen to help rachel. and then jewel come to 
me. 

"sho," i says. "help yourself outen the loft. feed him when you bait the 
mules." 

"i ratter pay you for him," he says. 

"what for?" i says. "i wouldn't begrudge no man a bait for his horse." 

"i rather pay you," he says; i thought he said extra. 

"extra for what?" i says. "wont he eat hay and corn?" 

"extra feed," he says. "i feed him a little extra and i dont want him

questioning face following the red and empty curve; beside the bade wheel jewel 
sits the horse, gazing straight ahead.

the sky. he buzzard is as still as if he were nailed to it. 

we turn into tull's lane. we pass the barn and go on, the wheels 

whispering in the mud, passing the green rows of cotton in the wild earth, and 

vernon little across the field behind the plow. he lifts his hand as we pass and 

stands there looking after us for a long while. 

"look, jewel," darl says. jewel sits on his horse like they were both made

re the land. it was just a tangle of yellow and 
the levee not less wider than a knife-back land of, with us setting in the wagon 
and on the horse and the mule. 

darl was looking at me, and then cash turned and looked at me with that 
look in his eyes like when he was figuring on whether the planks would fit her 
that night, like he was measuring them inside of him and not asking you to say 
what you thought and not even letting on he was listening if you did say it, but 
listening all right. jewel hadn't moved. he sat there on the horse, leaning a 
little forward, with that same look on his face when him and darl passed the 
house yesterday, coming back to get her. 

"if it was just up, we could drive across," anse says, "we could drive 
right on across it." 

sometimes a log would get shoved over the jam and float on, rolling and 
turning, and we could watch it go on to where the ford used to be. it would slow 
up and whirl crossways and hang out of water for a minute, and you could tel

"i give her my promised word in the presence of the lord," anse says. "i 
reckon it aint no need to worry." 



but still he does not start the mules. we set there above the water. 

another log bobs up over the jam and goes on; we watch it check up and swing 

slow for a minute where the ford used to be. then it goes on. 

"it might start falling tonight," i say. "you could lay over one more 

day." 

then jewel turns sideways on the horse. he has not moved until then, and 
he turns and looks at me. his face is kind of green, then it would go red and 
then green again. "get to hell on back to your damn plowing," he says. "who the 
hell asked you to follow us here?" 
"i never meant no harm," i say. 

"shut up, jewel," cash says. jewel looks back at the water, his face 
gritted, going red and green and then red. "well," cash says after a while, 
"what you want to do?"

gal. they are looking at the water. "dewey dell and vardaman and pa better walk 
across on the bridge," cash says. 

"vernon can help them," jewel says. "and we can hitch his mule ahead of 
ourn." 

"you aint going to take my mule into that water," i say. 

jewel looks at me. his eyes look like pieces of a broken plate. i'll pay 

for your damn mule. i'll buy it from you right now." 

"my mule aint going into that water," i say. 

"jewel's going to use his horse," darl says. "why wont you risk your mule,

teen, he took a spell 
of sleeping. one morning when i went to feed the mules the cows were still in 
the tie-up and then i heard pa go back to the house and call him. when we came 
on back to the house for breakfast he passed us, carrying the milk buckets, 
stumbling along like he was drunk, and he was milking when we put the mules in 
and went on to the field without him. we had been there an hour and still he 
never showed up. when dewey dell came with our lunch, pa sent her back to find 
jewel. they found him in the tie-up, sitting on the stool, asleep. 
after that, every morning pa would go in and wake him. he would go to 
sleep at die supper table and soon as supper was finished he would go to bed, 
and when i came in to bed he would be lying there like a dead man. yet still pa 
would have to wake him in the morning. he would get up, but he wouldn't hardly 
have half sense: he would stand for pa's jawing and complaining without a word 
and take the milk buckets and go to the barn, 
 
 ___________________________
 
and once i found him asleep at the 
cow, the bucket in place and half full and his hands up to the wrists in the 
milk and his head against the cow's flank. 

after that dewey dell had to do the milking. he still got up when pa waked 
him, going about what we told him to do in that dazed way. it was like he was 
trying hard to do them; that he was as puzzled as anyone else. 



"are you sick?" ma said. "dont you feel all right?" 
"yes," jewel said. "i feel all right." 

"he's just lazy, trying me," pa said, and jewel standing there, asleep on 
his feet like as not. "aint you?" he said, waking jewel up again to answer. 
"no," jewel said. 

"you take off and stay in the house today," ma said. 

"with that whole bottom piece to be busted out?" pa said. 'if you aint 

sick, what's the matter with you?" 

"nothing," jewel said. "i'm all right." 

"all right?" pa said. "you're asleep on your feet this minute." 

"no," jewel said. "i'm all

want him to stay in today." 

but he wouldn't do it. "i'm all right," he said, going on. but he wasn't 
all right. anybody could see it. he was losing flesh, and i have seen him go to 
sleep chopping; watched the hoe going slower and slower up and down, with less 
and less of an arc, until it stopped and he leaning on it motionless in the hot 
shimmer of the sun. 

ma wanted to get the doctor, but pa didn't want to spend the money without 
it was needful, and jewel did seem all right except for his thinness and his way 
of dropping off to sleep at any moment. he ate hearty enough, except for his way 
of going to sleep in his plate, with a piece of bread halfway to his mouth and 
his jaws still chewing. but he swore he was all right. 
it was ma that got dewey dell to do his milking, paid her somehow, and the 
other jobs around the house that jewel had been doing before supper she found 
some way for dewey dell and vardaman to do them. and doing them hersel

wasn't there. she would fix him special things to eat and hide them for him. and 
that may have been when i first found it out, that addie bundren should be 
hiding anything she did, who had tried to teach us that deceit was such that, in 
a world where it was, nothing else could be very bad or very important, not even 
poverty. and at times when i went in to go to bed she would be sitting in the 
dark by jewel where he was asleep. and i knew that she was hating herself for 
that deceit and hating jewel because she had to love him so that she had to act 
the deceit. 

one night she was taken sick and when i went to the barn to put the team 
in and drive to tull's, i couldn't find the lantern. i remembered noticing it on 
the nail the night before, but it wasn't there now at midnight. so i hitched in 
the dark and went on and came back with mrs tull just after daylight. and there 
the lantern was, hang

ing on the nail where i remembered it and couldn't find it 
before. and then one morning while dewey dell was milking just before sunup, 
jewel came into the barn from the back, through the hole in the back wall, with 
the lantern in his hand. 

i told cash, and cash and i looked at one another. 
"rutting," cash said. 

"yes," i said. "but why the lantern? and every night, too. no wonder he's 

losing flesh. are you going to say anything to him?" 

"wont do any good," cash said. 

"what he's doing now wont do any good, either." 

"i know. but he'll have to learn that himself. give him time to realise 

that it'll save, that there'll be

"she's sure a stayer," i told cash. "i used to admire her, but i downright 

respect her now." 

"it aint a woman," he said. 

"you know," i said. but he was watching me. "what is it, then?" 
"that's what i aim to find out," he said. 

"you can trail him through the woods all night if you want to," i said. 
"i'm not." 

"i aint trailing him," he said. 
"what do you call it, then?" 

"i aint trailing him," he said. i dont mean it that way." 

and so a few nights later i heard jewel get up and climb out the window, 

and then i heard cash get up and follow him. the next morning when i went to the 

barn, cash was already there, the mules fed, and he was helping dewey dell milk. 

and when i saw him i knew that he knew what it was. now and then i would catch 

him watching jewel with a queer look, like having found out where jewel went and 

what he was doing had given him something to really think about at last. but it 

was not a worried look; it was the kind of look i wo

uld see on him when i would 



find him doing some of jewel's work around the house, work that pa still thought 
jewel was doing and that ma thought dewey dell was doing. so i said nothing to 
him, believing that when he got done digesting it in his mind, he would tell me. 
but he never did. 

one morning-it was november then, five months since it started-jewel was 
not in bed and he didn't join us in the field. that was the first time ma 
learned anything about what had been going on. she sent vardaman down to find 
where jewel was, and after a while she came down too. it was as though, so long 
as the deceit ran along quiet and monotonous, all of us let ourselves be 
deceived, abetting it unawares or maybe through cowardice, since all people are 
cowards and naturally prefer any kind of treachery because it has a bland 
outside. but now it was like

there, looking at us.

"bought it?" pa said. "with what? did you buy that thing on my word?" 
"it was my money," jewel said. "i earned it. you wont need to worry about 
it" 

"jewel," ma said; "jewel." 

"it's all right," cash said. "he earned the money, he cleaned up that 

forty acres of new ground quick laid out last spring. he did it single handed, 

working at night by lantern. i saw him. so i dont reckon that horse cost anybody 

anything except jewel. i dont reckon we need worry."

"jewel," ma said, looking at him. i'll giveâi'll give. . .give . . ." 
then she began to cry. she cried hard, not hiding her face, standing there in 
her faded wrapper, looking at him and him on the horse, looking down at her, his 
face growing cold and a little sick looking, until he looked away quick and cash 
came and touched her. 

"you go on to the house," cash said. "this here ground is too wet for you. 
you go on, now." she put her hands to her face then and after a while she went

ing a little on the plow-marks. but pretty soon she straightened up 
and went on, she didn't look back. when she reached the ditch she stopped and 
called vardaman. he was looking at the horse, land of dancing up and down by it. 



"let me ride, jewel," he said. "let me ride, jewel." 

jewel looked at him, then he looked away again, holding the horse reined 

back. pa watched him, mumbling his lip. 

"so you bought a horse," he said. "you went behind my back and bought a 
horse. you never consulted me; you know how tight it is for us to make by, yet 
you bought a horse for me to feed. taken the work from your flesh and blood and 
bought a horse with it." jewel looked at pa, his eyes paler than ever. "he wont 
never eat a mouthful of yours," he said. "not a mouthful. ill kill him fi

"let me ride, jewel," vardaman said. "let me ride, jewel." he sounded like 

a cricket in the grass, a little one. "let me ride, jewel." 

that night i found ma sitting beside the bed where he was sleeping, in the 

dark. she cried hard, maybe because she had to cry so quiet; maybe because she 

felt the same way about tears she did about deceit, hating herself for doing it, 

hating him because she had to. and then i knew that i knew. i knew that as plain 

on that day as i knew about dewey dell on that day.

so they finally got anse to say what he wanted to do, and him and the gal and 
the boy got out of the wagon. b

like a driven horse. through the undergrowth it goes with a plaintive 
sound, a musing sound; in it the unwinded cane and saplings lean as before a 
little gale, swaying without reflections as though suspended on invisible wires 
from the branches overhead. above the ceaseless surface they stand-trees, cane, 
vines-rootless, severed from the earth, spectral above a scene of immense yet 
circumscribed desolation filled with the voice of the waste and mournful water. 
cash and i sit in the wagon; jewel sits the horse at the off rear wheel. 
the horse is trembling, its eye rolling wild and baby-blue in its long pink 
face, its breathing stertorous like groaning. he sits erect, poised, looking 
quietly and steadily and quickly this way and that, his face calm, a little 
pale, alert. cash's face is also gravely composed; he and i look at one another 
with long probing looks, looks that plunge unimpeded through one another's eyes 
and into the ultimate secret place where for an instant cash and d

on it." he looks about quietly, at the position of the trees, leaning this way 

and that, looking back along the floorless road shaped vaguely high in air by 

the position of the lopped and felled trees, as if the road too had been soaked 

free of earth and floated upward, to leave in its spectral tracing a monument to 

a still more profound desolation than this above which we now sit, talking 

quietly of old security and old trivial things. jewel looks at him, then at me, 

then his face turns in in that quiet; constant, questing about the scene, the 

horse trembling quietly and steadily between his knees. 

"he could go on ahead slow and sort of feel it out," i say. 

"yes," cash says, not looking at me. his face is in profile as he looks 

forward where jewel has moved on ahead. 

"he cant miss the river," i say. "he couldn't miss seeing it fifty yards 

ahead." 

cash does not look at me, his face in profile, "if i'd just suspicione

"the bridge was up then," i say. he does not look at me. "whitfield 
crossed it a-horseback." 

jewel looks at us again, his expression sober and alert and subdued. his 
voice is quiet. "what you want me to do?" 

"i ought to come down last week and taken a sight on it," cash says. 
"we couldn't have known," i say. "there wasn't any way for us to know." 



"i'll ride on ahead," jewel says. "you can follow where i am." he lifts 
the horse. it shrinks, bowed; he leans to it, speaking to it, lifting it forward 
almost bodily, it setting its feet down with gingerly splashings, trembling, 
breathing harshly. he speaks to it, murmurs to it. "go on," he says. "i aint 
going to let nothing hurt you. go on, now." 

"jewel," cash says. jewel does not look back. he lifts the horse on. 
"he can swim," i say. "if he'll just give the horse time, anyhow . . ."

forward, "i ought to come down last week and sighted. i ought to done it." 
"that's right," i say. "neither his feet nor his head would reach the end 
of it. you couldn't have known." i say. 

"i ought to done it," he says. he lifts the reins. the mules move, into 

the traces; the wheels murmur alive in the water. he looks back and down at 

addie. "it aint on a balance," he says. 

at last the trees open; against the open river jewel sits the horse, half 
turned, it belly deep now. across the river we can see vernon and pa and 
vardaman and dewey dell vernon is waving at us, waving us further down stream. 
"we are too high up," cash says. vernon is shouting too, but we cannot 
make out what he says for tie noise of the water. it runs steady and deep now, 
tin-broken, without sense of motion until a log comes along, turning slowly. 
"watch it," cash says. we watch it and see it falter and hang for a moment, the

before it shoots up and tumbles on. 
"there it is," i say. 

"ay," cash says. it's there." we look at vernon again. he is now flapping 

his arms up and down. we move on downstream, slowly and carefully, watching 

vernon. he drops his hands. "this is the place," cash says. 

"well, goddamn it, let's get across, then," jewel says, he moves the horse 

on. 

"you wait," cash says. jewel stops again. 

"well, by god--" he says. cash looks at the water, then he looks back at 
addie. "it aint on a balance," he says. 

"then go on back to the goddamn bridge and walk across," jewel says. "you 
and darl both. let me on that wagon." 

cash does not pay him any attention. it aint on a balance," he says. "yes, 
sir. we got to watch it." 

"watch it, hell," jewel says. "you get out of that wagon and let me have 

it. by god, if you're afraid to drive it over . . ." his eyes are pale as

bleached chips in his face. cash is looking at him. 

"we'll get it over," he says. "i tell you what you do. you ride on back 

and walk across the bridge and come down the other bank and meet us with the 

rope. vernon'll take your horse home with him and keep it till we get back." 

"you go to hell," jewel says. 

"you take the rope and come down the bank and be ready with it," cash 
says. "three cant do no more than two can-one to drive and one to steady it." 
"goddamn you," jewel says. 

"let jewel take the end of the rope and cross upstream of us and brace 
it," i say. "will you do that, jewel?" 

jewel watches me, hard. he looks quick at cash, then back at me, his eyes 



alert and hard. "i dont give a damn. just so we do something. setting here, not 

lifting a goddamn hand ..." 

"let's do that, cash," i say. 

"i reckon we'll have to," cash says.

her a little. his face is calm, down-sloped, calculant, concerned. he lifts his 

box of tools and wedges it forward tinder the seat; together we shove addie 

forward, wedging her between the tools and the wagon bed. then he looks at me. 

"no," i say. "i reckon i'll stay. might take both of us." 

from the tool box he takes his coiled rope and carries the end twice 

around the seat stanchion and passes the end to me without tying it. the other 

end he pays out to jewel, who takes a turn about his saddle horn. 

he must force the horse down into the current. it moves, highkneed, 

archnecked, boring and chafing. jewel sits lightly forward, his knees lifted a 

little; again his swift alert calm gaze sweeps upon us and on. he lowers the 

horse into the stream, speaking to it in a soothing murmur. the horse slips, 

goes under to the saddle, surges to its feet again, the current building up 

against jewel's thighs. 

"watch yourself," cash says.

the log appears suddenly between two hills, as if it had rocketed suddenly

the beard of an old man or a goat. when cash speaks to me i know that he has 
been watching it all the time, watching it and watching jewel ten feet ahead of 
us. "let the rope go," he says. with his other hand he reaches down and reeves 
the two turns from the stanchion. "ride on, jewel," he says; "see if you can 



pull us ahead of the log." 

jewel shouts at the horse; again he appears to lift it bodily between his 
knees. he is just above the top of the ford and the horse has a purchase of some 
sort for it surges forward, shining wetly half out of water, crashing on in a

at last that the rope is free, for i can see him sawing back on the reins, his 
head turned, as the log rears in a long sluggish lunge between us, bearing down 
upon the team. they see it too; for a moment they also shine black out of water. 
then the downstream one vanishes, dragging the other with him; the wagon sheers 
crosswise, poised on the crest of the ford as the log strikes it, tilting it up 
and on. cash is half turned, the reins running taut from his hand and

jammed over against the high side of the wagon. "jump clear," he says quietly. 
"stay away from the team and dont try to fight it. it'll swing you into the bend 
all right." 

"you come too," i say. vernon and vardaman are running along the bank, pa 
and dewey dell stand watching us, dewey dell with the basket and the package in 
her arms. jewel is trying to fight the horse back. the head of one mule appears, 
its eyes wide; it looks back at us for an instant, making a sound almost human. 
the head vanishes again. 

"back, jewel," cash shouts. "back, jewel." for another instant i see him 
leaning to the tilting wagon, his arm braced back against addie and his tools; i 
see the bearded head of the rearing log strike up again, and beyond it jewel 
holding the horse upreared, its head wrenched around, hammering its head with 
his fist. i

along the bank, watching the mules dive up slow again and then down again.

when i told cora how darl jumped out of the wagon and left cash sitting there 

trying to save it and the wagon turning over, and jewel that was almost to the

you're one of the folks that says darl is the queer one, the one that aint 

bright; and him the only one of them that had sense enough to get off that 

wagon. i notice anse was too smart to been on it a-tall." 

"he couldn't a done no good, if he'd been there," i said. "they was going

as the wagon got tilted good, to where the current could finish it, the log went 

on. it headed around the wagon and went on good as a swimming man could have 

done. it was like it had been sent there to do a job and done it and went on. 

when the mules finally kicked loose, it looked for a minute hike maybe 

cash would get the wagon back, it looked like him and the wagon wasn't moving at 

all, and just jewel fighting that horse back to the wagon. then that boy passed 

me, running and hollering at darl and the gal trying to catch him, and then i 

see the mules come rolling slow up out of the water, their legs spraddled stiff 

like they had balked upside down, and roll on into the water again. 

then the wagon tilted over and then it and jewel and the horse was all 

mixed up together. cash went outen sight, still holding the coffin braced, and

thought they was all going. i knew that the horse had got dragged off the ford 



too, and with that wild drowning horse and that wagon and that loose box, it was 
going to be pretty bad, and there i was, standing knee-deep in the water, 
yelling at anse behind me: "see what you done now? see what you done now?" 
the horse come up again. it was headed for the hank now, throwing its head 
up, and then i saw one

i started running along the bank, trying to catch sight of cash because, he 
couldn't swim, yelling at jewel where cash was like a durn fool, bad as that boy 
that was on down the bank still hollering at darl. 
so i went down into the water so i could still keep some kind of a grip in 
the mud, when i saw jewel. he was middle deep, so i knew he was on the ford, 
anyway, leaning hard upstream, and then i see the rope, and then i see the water 
building up where he was holding the wagon snubbed just below the ford. 
so it was cash holding to the horse when it come splashing and scrambling 
up the bank, moaning and groaning like a natural man. when i come to it it was 
just kicking cash loose from his holt on the saddle. his face turned up a second 
when he was sliding back into the water. it was gray, w

"further back than that," he says. "you git back by the tree and hold the rope 
for me, so it cant slip." 

vardaman backs along the rope, to the tree, moving blindly, watching 

vernon. when we come up he looks at us once, his eyes round and a little dazed. 

then be looks at vernon again in that posture of rapt alertness. 

"i got the hammer too," vernon says. "looks like we ought to done already

what else did he have?" 

"he aint talked yet," jewel says, entering the water. he looks back at me. 

"you go back and get him roused up to talk," he says. 

"pa's there," i say. i follow jewel into the water, along the rope. it 

feels alive in my hand, bellied faintly in a prolonged and resonant arc. vernon 

is watching me.

had not thought that water in july could be so cold. it is like hands molding 

and prodding at the very bones. vernon is still looking back toward the bank. 

"reckon it'll hold us all?" he says. we too look back, following the rigid 

bar of the rope as it rises from the water to the tree and vardaman crouched a 

little beside it, watching us. "wish my mule wouldn't strike out for home." 

vernon says. 

"come on," jewel says. "let's get outen here." 

we submerge in turn, holding to the rope, being clutched by one another 
while the cold wall of the water sucks the slanting mud backward and upstream 
from beneath our feet and we are suspended so, groping along the cold bottom. 
even the mud there is not still. it has a chill, scouring quality, as though the 
earth under us were in motion too. we touch and fumble at one another's extended 
arms, letting ourselves go cautiously against the rope; or, erect in tur

pa has come down to the shore, watching us. 

vernon comes up, streaming, his face sloped down into his pursed blowing 
mouth. his mouth is bluish, like a circle of weathered rubber. he has the rule. 
"he'll be glad of that," i say. it's right new. he bought it just last 
month out of the catalogue." 

"if we just knowed for sho what else," vernon says, looking over his 
shoulder and then turning to face where jewel had disappeared. "didn't he go 
down fore me?" vernon says. 



"i dont know," i say. "i think so. yes. yes, he did." 

we watch the thick curling surface, streaming away from us in slow whorls. 

"give him a pull on the rope," vernon says. 

"he's on your end of it," i say. 

"aint nobody on my end of it," he says. 

"pull it in," i say. but he has already done that, holding the end above 

the water; and then we see jewel. he is ten yards away; he comes up, blowing, 

and looks at us, tossing

"jewel," vernon says, not loud, but his voice going full and clear along 

the water, peremptory yet tactful. "it'll be back here. better come back." 

jewel dives again. we stand there, leaning back against the current, 

watching the water where he disappeared, holding the dead rope between us like 

two men holding the nozzle of a fire hose, waiting for the water. suddenly dewey 

dell is behind us in the water. "you make him come back," she says. "jewel!" she 

says. he comes up again, tossing his hair back from his eyes. he is swimming 

now, toward the bank, the current sweeping him downstream quartering. "you,

and holding the rope and see him gain the bank and 

climb out. as he rises from the water, he stoops and picks up something. he 

comes back along the bank. he has found the chalk-line. he comes opposite us and 

stands there, looking about as if he were seeking something. pa goes on down the 

bank. he is going back to look at the mules again where their round bodies float 

and rub quietly together in the slack water within the bend. 

"what did you do with the hammer, vernon?" jewel says. 

"i give it to him," vernon says, jerking his head at vardaman. vardaman is 

looking after pa. then he looks at jewel. "with the square." vernon is watching 

jewel. he moves toward the bank, passing dewey dell and me. 

"you get on out of here," i say. she says nothing, looking at jewel and 

vernon. 

"where's the hammer?" jewel says. vardaman scuttles tip the bank and 
fetches it. 

"it's heavier than the saw," vernon says. jewel is tying the end of the 
chalk-line about the hammer s

"hammer's got the most wood in it," jewel says. he and vernon face one 
another, watching jewel's hands. 

"and flatter, too," vernon says. 'it'd float three to one, almost. try the 
plane." 

jewel looks at vernon. vernon is tall, too; long and lean, eye to eye they 

stand in their close wet clothes. lon quick could look even at a cloudy sky and 

tell the time to ten minutes. big lon i mean, not little lon. 

"why dont you get out of the water?" i say. 

"it wont float like a saw," jewel says. 

"it'll float nigher to a saw than a hammer will," vernon says. 

"bet you," jewel says. 

"i wont bet," vernon says. 

they stand there, watching jewel's still hands. 

"hell," jewel says. "get the plane, then." 

so they get the plane and tie it to the chalk-line and enter the water 
again. pa comes back along the bank. he stops for a while and looks at us, 
hunched, mournful, like a failing steer or an old tall bird. 
vernon and jewel return, leaning against the current. "get out of t

she crowds against me a little so they can pass, jewel holding the plane 
high as though it were perishable, the blue string trailing back over his 
shoulder. they pass us and stop; they fall to arguing quietly about just where 
the wagon went over. 

"darl ought to know," vernon says. they look at me. 
"i dont know," i says. "i wasn't there that long" 

"hell," jewel says. they move on, gingerly, leaning against the current, 
reading the ford with their feet. 

"have you got a holt of the rope?" vernon says. jewel does not answer. he 
glances back at the shore, calculant, then at the water. he flings the plane 
outward, letting the string run through his fingers, his fingers turning blue 
where it runs over them. when the line stops, he hands it back to vernon. 
"better let me go this time," vernon says. again jewel does not answer; we

"jewel," dewey dell whimpers. 

"it aint so deep there," vernon says. he does not look back. he is 
watching the water where jewel went under. 
when jewel comes up he has the saw. 

when we pass the wagon pa is standing beside it; scrubbing at the two mud 
smears with a handful of leaves. against the jungle jewel's horse looks like a 
patchwork quilt hung on a line. 

cash has not moved. we stand above him, holding the plane, the saw, the 

hammer, the square, the rule, the chalk-line, while dewey dell squats and lifts 

cash's head. "cash," she says; "cash." 

he opens his eyes, staring profoundly up at our inverted faces. 

"if ever was such a misfortunate man," pa says. 

"look, cash," we say, holding the tools up so he can see; "what else did 

you have?" 

he tries to speak, rolling his head, shutt

"cash," we say; "cash." 

it is to vomit he is turning his head. dewey dell wipes his mouth on the 
wet hem of her dress; then he can speak. 

"it's his saw-set," jewel says. "the new one he bought when he bought the 
rule." he moves, turning away. vernon looks tip after him, still squatting. then 
he rises and follows jewel down to the water. 

"if ever was such a misfortunate man," pa says. he looms tall above us as 
we squat; he looks like a figure carved clumsily from tough wood by a drunken 
caricaturist. "it's a trial." he says. "but i doat begrudge her it. no man can 
say i begrudge her it" dewey dell-has kid cash's head back on the folded coat 
twisting his head a little to avoid the vomit beside him his tools lie. "a

jewel and vernon are in the river again. from here they do not appear to 
violate the surface at all; it is as though it had severed them both at a single 
blow, the two torsos moving with infinitesimal and ludicrous care upon the 
surface. it looks peaceful, like machinery does after you have watched it and 
listened to it for a long time. as though the clotting which is you had 
dissolved into the myriad original motion, and seeing and hearing in themselves

then i found that i had jewel. when i waked to remember to discover it, he was 

two months gone. 

my father said that the reason for living is getting ready to stay dead. i 

knew at last what he meant and that he could not have known what he meant 



himself, because a man cannot know anything about cleaning up the house 
afterward. and so i have cleaned my house. with jewel--i lay by the lamp, 
holding up my own head, watching him cap and suture it before he breathed-the 
wild blood boiled away and the sound of it ceas

i gave anse dewey dell to negative jewel. then i gave him vardaman to 

replace the child i had robbed him of. and now he has three children that are 

his and not mine. and then i could get ready to die. 

one day i was talking to cora. she prayed for me because she believed i 

was blind to sin, wanting me to kneel and pray too, because people to whom sin 

is just a matter of words, to them salvation is just words too.

be he thought that if he just stayed down 
there ready to take out santa claus would maybe bring him a span of mules. "but 
i reckon i can talk him around," he says. "a man'll always help a fellow in a 
tight, if he's got ere a drop of christian blood in him." 

"of course you're welcome to the use of mine," i said, me knowing how much 
he believed that was the reason. 

"i thank you," he said. "she'll want to go in ourn," and him knowing how 
much i believed that was the reason. 

after supper jewel rode over to the bend to get peabody. i heard he was to 
be there today at varner's. jewel come back about midnight. peabody had gone 
down below inverness somewhere, but uncle billy come back with him, with his 
satchel of horse physic. like he says, a man aint so different from a horse or a 
mule, come long come short, except a mule or a horse has got a little more 
sense. "what you been into now, boy?" he says, looking at cash. "get me a 
mattress and a chair and a glass of whisky," he says.
 
 ___________________________
 
 



he made cash drink the whisky, then he run anse out of the room. "lucky it 
was the same leg he broke last summer," anse says, mournful, mumbling and 
blinking. "that's something." 

we folded the mattress across cash's legs and set the chair on the 
mattress and me and jewel set on the chair and the gal held the lamp and uncle 
billy taken a chew of tobacco and went to work. cash fought pretty hard for a 
while, until he fainted. then he laid still, with big balls of sweat standing on 
his face like they had started to roll down and then stopped to wait for him. 
when he waked up, uncle billy had done packed up and left. he kept on 
trying to say something until the gal leaned down and wiped his mouth. "it's his 
tools," she said. 

"i brought them in," darl said. 
 
 ___________________________
 
"i got them." 

he tried to talk again; she leaned down. "he wants to see them," she said. 

so darl brought them in where he could see them. they shoved them under the side 

of the bed, where he could reach his hand and touch them when he felt better. 

next morning anse taken that horse and rode over to the bend to see snopes. him 

and jewel stood in the lot talking a while, then anse got on the horse and rode 

off. i reckon that was the first time jewel ever let anybody ride that horse, 

and until anse come back he hung around in that swole-up way, watching the road 

like he was half a mind to take out after anse and get the horse back. 

along toward nine oclock it begun to get hot. that was when i see the 

first buzzard. because of the wetting, i reckon. anyway it wasn't until well 

into the day that i see them. lucky the breeze was -setting away from the house, 

so it wasn't until well into the morning. but soon as i see them it was li

maybe he might have fell into the well or something, so i 

whipped up and come into the lot on the lope. 

there must have been a dozen of them setting along the ridge-pole of the 
bam, and that boy was chasing another one around the lot like it was a turkey 
and it just lifting enough to dodge him and go flopping bade to the roof of the 
shed again where he had found it setting on the coffin. it had got hot then, 
right, and the breeze had dropped or changed or something, so i went and found 
jewel, but lula come out. 

"you got to do something,'" she said. "it's a outrage." 
"that's what i aim to do," i said. 

"it's a outrage," she said. "he should be lawed for treating her so." 

"he's getting her into the ground the best he can," i said. so i found 

jewel and asked him if he didn't want to take one of the mules and go over to 

the bend and see about anse. he didn't say nothing. he just looked at me with 

his jaws going bone-white and them bone-white eyes of hisn, then he went and

begun to call darl. 

"what you fixing to do?" i said. 

he didn't answer. darl come out. "come on," jewel said. 
"what you aim to do?" darl said. 

"going to move the wagon," jewel said over his shoulder. 

"dont be a fool," i said. "i never meant nothing. you couldn't help it." 

and darl hung back too but nothing woulddn't suit jewel. 

"shut your goddamn mouth," he says. 

"it's got to be somewhere," darl said. "we'll take out soon as pa gets 
back." 



"you wont help me?" jewel says, them white eyes of hisn kind of blaring 
and his face shaking like he had a aguer. 
"no," darl said. "i wont. wait till pa gets back." 

so i stood in the door and watched him push and pull at that wagon. it was 
on a downhill, and once i thought he was fixing to beat out the back end of the 
shed. then, the dinner bell rung. i called him, but he didn't look around. "come 
on to dinner," i said. 'tell that boy." but he didn't answer, so i went on to 
dinner. the gal went down to get that

so sho i would regret it. 

he come riding up just as i went out to the porch, where they all was. he 

looked kind of funny: kind of more hang-dog than common, and kind of proud too. 

like he had done something he thought was cute but wasn't so sho now how other 

folks would take it. 

"i got a team," he said. 

"you bought a team from snopes?" i said. 

"i reckon snopes aint the only man in this country that can drive a 

trade," he said. 

"sho," i said. he was looking at jewel, with that funny look, but jewel 

had done got down from the porch and was going toward the horse. to see what 

anse had done to it, i reckon. 

"jewel," anse says. jewel looked back. "come here," anse says. jewel come 
back a little and stopped again, 
"what you want?" he said. 

"so you got a team from snopes," i said. "he'll send them over tonight, i 
reckon? you'll want a early start tomorrow, long as you'll have to go by 
mottson." 

then he quit looking like he had been for a while. he

"i do the best i can," he said. "fore god, if there were ere a man in the 

living world suffered the trials and floutings i have suffered." 

"a fellow that just beat snopes in a trade ought to feel pretty good," i 

said. "what did you give him, anse?" 

he didn't look at me. "i give a chattel mortgage on my cultivator and 
seeder," he said. 

"but they aint worth forty dollars. how far do you aim to get with a forty 
dollar team?" 

they were all watching him now, quiet and steady. jewel was stopped, 
halfway back, waiting to go on to the horse. "i give other things," anse said. 
he begun to mumble his mouth again, standing there like he was waiting for 
somebody to hit him and him with his mind already made up not to do nothing 
about it. 

"what other things?" darl said. 



"hell," i said. "you take my team. you can bring them back. ill get along 
someway." 

"so thats what you were doing in cash's clothes last night," darl said. he 
said it just like he was reading it outen

 the paper. like he never give a durn 
himself one way or the other. jewel had come back now, standing there, looking 
at anse with them marble eyes of hisn. "cash aimed to buy that talking machine 
from suratt with that money," darl said. 

anse stood there, mumbling his mouth. jewel watched him. he aint never 
blinked yet. 

"but that's just eight dollars more," darl said, in that voice like he was 

just listening and never give a durn himself. "that still wont buy a team." 

anse looked at jewel, quick, kind of sliding his eyes that way, then he 

looked down again. "god knows, if there were ere a man," he says. still they 

didn't say nothing. they just watched him, waiting, and hire sliding his eyes 

toward their feet and up their legs but no higher. "and the horse," he says. 

"what horse?" jewel said. anse just stood there. i be durn, if a man cant 

keep the upper hand of his sons, he ought to run them away from home, no matter 

how big they are. and if he cant do that, i be dur

anse stands there, dangle-armed. "for fifteen years i aint had a tooth in 
my head," he says. "god knows it. he knows in fifteen years i aint et the 
victuals he aimed for man to eat to keep his strength up, and me saving a nickel 
here and a nickel there so my family wouldn't suffer it to buy them teeth so i 
could eat god's appointed food. i give that money. i thought that if i could do

"i didn't know who brung it," eustace said. "i never see them. i just 

found the horse in the barn this morning when i went to feed, and i told mr 

snopes and he said to bring the team on over here." 

well, that'll be the last they'll ever see of him now, sho enough. come 

christmas time they'll maybe get a postal -card from nim in texas, i reckon. and 

if it hadn't a been jewel, i reckon it'd a been me; i owe him that much, myself. 

i be durn if anse dont conjure a man, some way. i be durn if he aint a sight.

now there are seven of them, in little tall black circles. 
"look, darl," i say; "see?" 

he looks up. we watch them in little tall black circles of not-moving. 
"yesterday there were just four," i say. 
there were more than four on the barn. 

"do you know what i would do if he tries to light on the wagon again?" i 
say. 

"what would you do?" darl

"how do you feel, cash?" darl says. 

"it dont bother none," cash says. 

"do you want it propped a little higher?" darl says. 

cash has a broken leg. he has had two broken legs. he lies on the box with 

a quilt rolled under his head and a piece of wood under his knee. 

"i reckon we ought to left him at armstid's," pa says. 

i haven't got a broken leg and pa hasn't and darl hasn't and "it's just 

the bumps," cash says. "it kind of grinds together a little on a bump. it dont

"it's because she wouldn't have us beholden," pa says. "fore god, i do the 

best that ere a man" is it because jewel's mother is a horse darl? i said. 

"maybe i can draw the ropes a little tighter," darl says. that's why

"do you want pa to drive slower?" darl says. 

"no," cash says. "aint no time to hang back. it dont bother none." 

"we'll have to get some medicine at mottson," pa says. "i reckon we'll 

have to." 

"tell him to go on," cash says. we go on. dewey dell leans back and wipes 
cash's face. cash is my brother. but jewel's mother is a horse. my mother is a 
fish. darl says that when we come to the water again i might see her and dewey 
dell said, she's in the box; how could she have got out? she got out through 
the holes i bored, into the water i said, and when we come to the water again i 
am going to see her. my mother is not in the box. my mother does not smell like

profound questioning look. 

"that'll steady it," i say. 

"ay," cash says. "i'm obliged." 

then we all turn on the wagon and watch him. he is coming up the road 
behind us, wooden-backed, wooden-faced, moving only from his hips down. he 
comes tip without a word, with his pale rigid eyes in his high sullen face, and 
gets into the wagon. 

"here's a hill," pa says. "i reckon you'll have to get out and walk." 



vardaman 

darl and jewel and dewey dell and i are walking tip the hill, behind the wagon. 
jewel came back. he came up the road and got into the wagon. he was walking. 
jewel hasn't got a horse anymore. jewel is my brother. 'cash is my brother. cash 
has a broken leg. we fixed cash's leg so it doesn't hurt. cash is my brother. 
jewel is my brother too, but he hasn't got a broken leg. 
now there are five of them, tall in little tall black circles.

the hill goes off into the sky. then the sun comes up from behind the hill 
and the mules and the wagon and pa walk on the sun. you cannot watch them, 
walking slow on the sun. in jefferson it is red on the track behind the glass. 
the track goes shining round and round. dewey dell says so. 
tonight i am going to see where they stay while we are in the barn.

the breeze was setting up from the barn, so we put her under the apple 
tree, where the moonlight can dapple the apple tree upon the long slumbering 
flanks within which now and then she talks in little trickling bursts of secret 
and murmurous bubbling. i took vardaman to listen. when we came up the cat 
leaped down from it and flicked away with silver claw and silver eye into the 
shadow. 

"your mother was a horse, but who was your father, jewel?" 

"you godda

"dont call me that," i say. 

"you goddamn lying son of a bitch." 

"dont you call me that, jewel." in the tall moonlight his eyes look like 

spots of white paper pasted on a high small football. 

after supper cash began to sweat a little. "it's getting a little hot," he 

said. "it was the sun shining on it all day, i reckon." 

"you want some water poured on it?" we say. "maybe that will ease it 

some." 

"i'd be obliged," cash said. "it was the sun shining on it, i reckon. i 
ought to thought and kept it covered." 

"we ought to thought," we said. "you couldn't have suspicioned." 

"i

 never noticed it getting hot," cash said. "i ought to minded it." 

so we poured the water over it. his leg and foot below the cement looked 

like they had been boiled. "does that feel better?" we said. 

"i'm obliged," cash said. "it feels fine." 

dewey dell wipes his face with the hem of her dress. 



"see if you can get some sleep," we say. 
"sho," cash says. "i'm right obliged. it feels fine now." 
jewel, i say, who was your father, jewel? 
goddamn you. goddamn you.

she was under the apple tree and darl and i go across the moon and the cat jumps 
down and runs and we can hear her inside the wood. 
"hear?" darl says. "put your ear close." 

i put my ear close and i can hear her. only i cant tell what she is 
saying. 

"what is she saying, darl?" i say. "who is she talking to?" 

"she's talking to god," darl says. "she is calling on him to help her." 

"what does she want him to do?" i say. 

"she wants him to hide

and i saw something dewey dell told me not to tell nobody 

cash is sick in his leg. we fixed his leg this afternoon, but he is sick 

in it again, lying on the bed. we pour water on his leg and then he feels fine. 

"i feel fine," cash says. i'm obliged to you." 

"try to get some sleep," we say. 

"i feel fine," cash says. "i'm obliged to you." 

and i saw something dewey dell told me not to tell nobody. it is not 

about pa and it is not about cash and it is not about jewel and it is not about 

dewey dell and it is not about me 

dewey dell and i are going to sleep on the pallet it is on the back porch, 
where we can see the barn, and the moon shines on half of the pallet and we will 
lie half in the white and half in the black, with the moonlight on our legs. and 
then i am going to see where they stay at night while we are in the barn. we are 
not in the barn tonight but i can see the barn and so i am going to find where 
they stay at night.

it goes round and round on the shining track. then the track goes shining

"will what be there?" 
"that train. in the window." 

"you go to sleep. you can see tomorrow if it's there." 
maybe santa claus wont know they are town boys. 
"dewey dell." 

"you go to sleep. he aint going to let none of them town boys have it." 
it was behind the window, red on the track, the track shining round and 
round. it made my heart hurt and then it was pa and jewel and darl and mr 
gillespie's boy. mr gillespie's boy's legs come down under his nightshirt when 
he goes into the moon, his legs fuzz. they go on around the house toward the 
apple tree. 

"what are they going to do, dewey dell?" 

they went around the house toward the apple tree. 

"i can smell her," i say. "can you smell her, too?" 

"hush," dewey dell says. "the wind's changed. go to sleep." 

and so i am going to know where they stay at night soon. they come around

re the horse screams. it plunges and kicks, the sound of the 
crashing blows sucking up into the sound of the flames. they sound like an 
interminable train crossing an endless trestle. gillespie and mack pass me, in 
knee-length nightshirts, shouting, their voices thin and high and meaningless 
and at the same time profoundly wild and sad: ". . . cow . . . stall . . ." 
gillespie's nightshirt rushes ahead of him on the draft, ballooning about his 
hairy thighs. 

the stall door has swung shut. jewel thrusts it back with his buttocks and 

he appears, his back arched, the muscles ridged through his garment as he drags 



the horse out by its head. in the glare its eyes roll with soft, fleet, wild 
opaline fire; its muscles bunch and run as it flings its head about, lifting 
jewel clear of the ground. he drags it on, slowly, terrifically; again he gives 
me across his shoulder a single glare furious and brief. even when they are 
clear of the barn the horse continues to fight and lash backw

doorway until gillespie passes me, stark-naked, his nightshirt wrapped about the 
mule's head, and beats the maddened horse on out of the door. 
jewel returns, running; again he looks down at file coffin. but he comes 
on. "where's cow?" he cries, passing me. i follow him. in the stall mack is 
struggling with the other mule. when its head turns into the glare i can see the 
wild rolling of its eye too, but it makes no sound. it just stands there, 
watching mack over its shoulder, swinging its hind quarters toward him whenever 
he approaches. he looks back at us, his eyes and mouth three round holes in his 
face on which the freckles look lik

e english peas on a plate. his voice is thin, 
high, faraway. 

"i cant do nothing ..." it is as though the sound had been swept from his 
lips and up and away, speaking back to us from an immense distance of 
exhaustion. jewel slides past us; the mule whirls and lashes out, but he has 
already gained its head. i lean to mack's ear: 
"nightshirt. around his head." 

mack stares at me. then he rips the nightshirt off and flings it over the 

mule's head, and it becomes docile at once. jewel is yelling at him: "cow? cow?" 

"back," mack cries. "last stall." 

the cow watches us as we enter. she is backed into the corner, head 
lowered, still chewing though rapidly. but she makes no move. jewel has paused, 
looking up, and suddenly we watch the entire floor to the loft dissolve. it just 
turns to fire; a faint litter of sparks rains down. he glances about. back under 
the trough is a three legged milking stool. he catches it up and swings it into 
the planking of the rear wall. he s

plinters a plank, then another, a third; we 
tear the fragments away. while we are stooping at the opening something charges 
into us from behind. it is the cow; with a single whistling breath she rushes 
between us and through the gap and into the outer glare, her tail erect and 
rigid as a broom nailed upright to the end of her spine. 
jewel turns back into the barn. "here," i say; "jewel!" i grasp at him; he 
strikes my hand down. "you fool," i say, "dont you see you cant make it hack 
yonder?" the hallway looks like a searchlight turned into rain. "come on," i 
say, "around this way." 

when we are through the gap he begins to run. "jewel," i say, running. he 
darts around the corner. when i reach it he has almost reached the next one, 
running against the glare like that figure cut from tin. pa and gillespie and 
mack are some distance away, watching the barn, pink against th

when i reach the front, he is struggling with gillespie; the one lean in 
underclothes, the other stark naked. they are like two figures in a greek 
frieze, isolated out of all reality by the red glare. before i can reach them he 
has struck gillespie to the ground and turned and run back into the barn. 
the sound of it has become quite peaceful now, like the sound of the river 
did. we watch through the dissolving proscenium of the doorway as jewel runs 
crouching to the far end of the coffin and stoops to it. for an instant he looks 
up and out at us through the rain of burning hay like a portiere of flaming 
beads, and i can see his mouth shape as he calls my name. 
"jewel!" dewey dell cries; "jewel!" it seems to me that i now hear the 



accumulation of her voice through the last five minutes, and i hear her 
scuffling and struggling as pa and mack hold her, screaming "jewell jewel!" but 
he is no longer looking at us. we see his shou

coffin and slides it single-handed from the sawhorses. it looms unbelievably 
tall, hiding him: i would not have believed that addie bundren would have needed 
that much room to lie comfortable in; for another instant it stands upright 
while the sparks rain on it in scattering bursts as though they engendered other 
sparks from the contact. then it topples forward, gaining momentum, revealing 
jewel and the sparks raining on him too in engendering gusts, so that he appears 
to be enclosed in a thin nimbus of fire. without stopping it overends and rears 
again, pauses, then crashes slowly forward and through the curtain. this time 
jewel is riding upon it, clinging to it, until it crashes down and flings him 
forward and clear and mack leaps forward into a thin smell of scorching meat and 
slaps at the widening crimson-edged holes that bloom like flowers in his 
undershirt.

it just cracked. it wouldn't come off. 

"it'll take the hide, too," mr gillespie said. "why in the tarnation you 
put it on there. didn't none of you think to grease his leg first?" 
"i just aimed to help him," pa said. "it was darl put it on." 
"where is darl?" they said. 

"didn't none of you have more sense than that?" mr gillespie said. "i'd a 
thought he would, anyway." 

jewel was lying on his face. his back was red. dewey dell put the medicine 
on it. the medicine was made out of butter and soot, to draw out the fire. then 
his back was black. 

"does it hurt, jewel?" i said. "your back looks like a nigger's, jewel," i 

said. cash's foot and leg looked like a nigger's. then they broke it off. cash's 

leg bled. 

"you go on back and lay down," dewey dell said. "you ought to be asleep." 
"where is darl?" they said.

"you needn't to cry," i said. "jewel got her out. you needn't to cry,

the barn is still red. it used to be redder than this. then it went

the train did.

high against it they hand in narrowing circles, like the smoke, with an outward 
semblance of from and purpose, but with no inference of motion, progress or 
retrograde, we mount the wagon again where cash lies on the box, the jagged 
shards of cement cracked about his leg. the shabby mules droop rattling and 
clanking down the hill. 

"we'll have to take him to the doctor," pa says. "i reckon it aint no way 
around it." the back of jewel's shirt, where it touches him, stains slow and 
black with grease. life was created in the valleys. it blew up onto the hills on 
the old terrors, the old lusts, the old 'despairs. that's why you must walk up 
the hills so you can ride down. 

dewey dell sits on the seat, the newspaper package on her lap. when we 
reach the foot of the hill where the road flattens between close walls of trees, 
she begins to look about quietly from one side of the road to the other. at last 
she says,

"why didn't you?" i say. "you could have telephoned." 

"what for?" jewel says. "who the hell cant dig a hole in the ground?" 

a car comes over the hill. it begins to sound the torn, slowing. it runs 

along the roadside in low gear, the outside wheels in the ditch, and passes us 

and goes on. vardaman watches it until it is out of sight. 

"how far is it now, darl?" he says. 

"not far," i say. 

"we ought to done it," pa says. "i just never wanted to be beholden to 
none except her flesh and blood." 

"who the hell cant dig a damn hole in the ground?" jewel says.

"it aint respectful, talking that way about her grave," pa says. "you all 

dont know what it is. you never pure loved her, none of you." jewel does not 

answer. he sits a little stiffly erect, his body arched away from his shirt. his 

high-colored jaw juts. 

dewey dell returns. we watch her emerge from the bushes, carrying the 
package, and climb into the wagon. she now wears her sunday dress, her beads, 
her shoes and stockings. 

"i thought i told you to leave them clothes to home," pa says. she does 

not answer, does not look at us. she sets the package in the wagon and gets in. 

the wagon moves on. 

"how many more hills now,

say. "the next one goes right up into town." 

this hill is red sand, bordered on either hand by negro cabins; against 

the sky ahead the massed telephone lines run, and the clock on the courthouse 

lifts among the trees. in the sand the wheels whisper, as though the very earth 

would hush our entry. we descend as the hill commences to rise. 

we follow the wagon, the whispering wheels, passing the cabins where faces 

come suddenly to the doors, white-eyed. we hear sudden voices, ejaculant. jewel 

has been looking from side to side; now his head turns forward and i can see his 

ears taking on a still deeper tone of furious red. three negroes walk beside the 

road ahead of us; ten feet ahead of them a white man walks. when we pass the 

negroes their heads turn suddenly with that expression of shock and instinctive 

outrage. "great god," one says; "what they got in that wagon?" 

jewel whirls. "son of a bitches," he says. as he does so he is abreast of 

the white man, who has paused

. it is as though jewel had gone blind for the 

moment, for it is the white man toward whom he whirls. 

"darl!" cash says from the wagon. i grasp at jewel. the white man has 

fallen back a pace, his face still slack-jawed; then his jaw tightens, claps to. 

jewel leans above him, his jaw muscles gone white. 

"what did you say?" he says. 

"here," i say. "he dont mean anything, mister. jewel," i say. when i touch 
him he swings at the man. i grasp his arm; we struggle. jewel has never looked 
at me. he is trying to free his arm. when i see the man again he has an open 
knife in his hand. 

"hold up, mister," i say; "i've got him. jewel," i say. 

"thinks because he's a goddamn town fellow," jewel says, panting, 

wrenching at me. "son of a bitch," he says. 

the man moves. he begins to edge around me, watching jewel, the knife low 
against his flank. "cant no man call me that," he says. pa has got down, and 
dewey dell is holding jewel, pushing at him. i release hi

"wait," i say. "he dont mean nothing. he's sick; got burned in a fire last 
night, and he aint himself." 

"fire or no fire," the man says, "cant no man call me that." 
"he thought you said something to him," i say. 
"i never said nothing to him. i never see him before." 
"fore god," pa says; "fore god." 

"i know," i say. "he never meant anything. he'll take it back." 
"let him take it back, then." 
"put up your knife, and he will." 

the man looks at me. he looks at jewel. jewel is quiet now. 
"put up your knife," i say. the man shuts the knife. 
"fore god," pa says. "fore god." 

"tell him you didn't mean anything, jewel," i say. "i thought he said 

something," jewel says. "just because he's--" 

"hush," i say. "tell him you didn't mean it." 

"i didn't mean it," jewel says. 

"he better not," the man says. "calling me a-" 

"do you think he's afraid to call you that?" i say. 

the man looks at me. "i never said that," he said. 

"dont think it, neither," jewe

"shut up," i say. "come on. drive on, pa." 

the wagon moves. the man stands watching us. jewel does not look back. 
"jewel would a whipped him," vardaman says. 
we approach the crest, where the street runs, where cars go back and 
forth; the mules haul the wagon up and onto the crest and the street. pa stops 
them. the street runs on ahead, where the square opens and the monument stands 
before the courthouse. we mount again while the heads turn with that expression 
which we know; save jewel. he does not get on, even though the wagon has started 
again. "get in, jewel," i say. "come on. let's get away from here."

sn't nothing else to do. it was either send him to jackson, or have 
gillespie sue us, because he knowed some way that darl set fire to it. i dont 
know how he knowed, but he did. vardaman see him do it, but he swore he never 
told nobody but dewey dell and that she told him not to tell nobody. but 
gillespie knowed it. but he would a suspicioned it sooner or later. he could 
have done it that night just watching the way darl acted. 
and so pa said, "i reckon there aint nothing else to do," and jewel said, 
"you want to fix him now?" 
"fix him?" pa said. 

"catch him and tie him up," jewel said. "goddamn it; do you want to wait 

until he sets fire to the goddamn team and wagon?" 

but there wasn't no use in that. "there aint no use in that," i said. "we 

can wait till she is underground." a fellow that's going to spend the rest of 

his life locked up, he ought to be let to have what pleasure he can have before 

he goes. 

"i reckon he ought to be there," pa says. "god knows, it's a tria

seems like it aint no end to bad luck when once it starts." 

sometimes i aint so sho who's got ere a right to say when a man is crazy 

and when he aint. sometimes i think it aint none of us pure crazy and aint none 

of us pure sane until the balance of us talks him that-a-way. it's like it aint 

so much what a fellow does, but it's the way the majority of folks is looking at 

him when he does it. 

because jewel is too hard on him. of course it was jewel's horse was 
traded to get her that nigh to town, and in a sense it was the value of his 
horse darl tried to burn up. but i thought more than once before we crossed the 
river and after, how it would be god's blessing if he did take her outen our 
hands and get shut of her in some clean way, and it seemed to me that when jewel 
worked so to get her outen the river, he was going against god in a way, and 
then when darl seen that it looked like one of us would have to do something, i

 rough lumber fitten to build a chicken coop. but it's better to build 
a tight chicken coop than a shoddy courthouse, and when they both build shoddy 
or build well, neither because it's one or toothier is going to make a man feel 
the better nor the worse. 

so we went up the street, toward the square, and he said, "we better take 
cash to the doctor first. we can leave him there and come back for him." that's 
it. it's because me and him was born close together, and it nigh ten years 
before jewel and dewey dell and vardaman begun to come along. i feel kin to 
them, all right, but i dont know. and me being the oldest, and thinking already 
the very thing that he done: i dont know. 
pa was looking at me, then at him, mumbling his mouth. 
"go on," i said. "we'll get it done first." 
"she would want us all there," pa says. 

"let's take cash to the doctor first," darl said. "she'll wait. she's 
already waited nine days." 

"you all dont know," pa says. "the somebody you was young with and y

"we got the digging to do, too," i said. 

"armstid and gillespie both told you to send word ahead," darl said. "dont 
you want to go to peabody's now, cash?" 

"go on," i said. "it feels right easy now. it's best to get things done in 
the right place." 

"if it was just dug," pa says. "we forgot our spade, too." 

"yes," darl said. "i'll go to the hardware store. we'll have to buy one." 

"it'll cost money," pa says. 

"do you begrudge her it?" darl says. 

"go on and get a spade," jewel said. "here. give me the money." 
but pa didn't stop. "i reckon we can get a spade," he said. "i reckon 



there are christians here." so darl set still and we went on, with jewel 

squatting on the tail-gate, watching the back of darl's head. he looked like one 

of these bull dogs, one of these dogs that dont bark none, squatting against the 

rope, watching the thing he was waiting to jump at. 

he set that way all the time we was in front of mrs bundren's house, 

hearing the music, watchi

d hear the music. 

"maybe they got one here," he said. he pulled up at mrs bundren's. it was 

like he knowed. sometimes i think that if a working man could see work as far 

ahead as a lazy man can see laziness. so he stopped there like he knowed, before 

that little new house, where the music was. we waited there, hearing it. i 

believe i could have dickered suratt down to five dollars on that one of his. 

it's a comfortable thing, music is. "maybe they got one here," pa says. 

"you want jewel to go," darl says, "or do you reckon i better?" 

"i reckon i better," pa says. he got down and went up the path and around 

the house to the back. the music stopped, then it started again. 

"he'll get it, too," darl said. 

"ay," i said. it was just like he knowed, like he could see through the 
walls and into the next ten minutes. 

only it was more than ten minutes. the music stopped and never commenced 
again for a good spell, where her and pa was talking at the back. we waited in

"you let me take you back to peabody's," darl said. 
"no," i said. "we'll get her underground." 

"if he ever gets back," jewel said. he begun to cuss. he started to get 
down from the wagon. "i'm going," he said. 

then we saw pa coming back. he had two spades, coming around the house. he 

laid them in the wagon and got in and we went on. the music never started again. 

pa was looking back at the house. he kind of lifted his hand a little and i saw 

the shade pulled back a little at the window and her face in it. 

but the curiousest thing was dewey dell. it surprised me. i see all the 

while how folks could say he

 like getting mad at a mud-puddle that 

splashed you when you stepped in it. and then i always kind of had a idea that 

him and dewey dell kind of knowed things betwixt them. if i'd a said it was ere 

a one of us she liked better than ere a other, i'd a said it was darl. but when 

we got it filled and covered and drove out the gate and turned into the lane 

where them fellows was waiting, when they come out and come on him and he jerked 

back, it was dewey dell that was on him before even jewel could get at him. and 

then i believed i knowed how gillespie knowed about how his barn taken fire. 

she hadn't said a word, hadn't even looked at him, but when them fellows 

told him what they wanted and that they had come to get him and he throwed back, 

she jumped on him like a wild cat so that one of the fellows had to quit and 

hold her and her scratching and clawing at him like a wild cat, while the other

up at me. 

"i thought you would have told me," he said. "i never thought you wouldn't 
have." 

"darl," i said. but he fought again, him and jewel and the fellow, and the 
other one holding dewey dell and vardaman yelling and jewel saying, 
"kill him. kill the son of a bitch." 

it was bad so. it was bad. a fellow cant get away from a shoddy job. he 

cant do it. i tried to tell him, but he just said, "i thought you'd a told me. 

it's not that i," he said, then he begun to laugh. the other fellow pulled jewel 

off of him and he sat there on the ground, laughing. 

i tried to tell him. if i could have just moved, even set up. but i tried 

to tell him, and he quit laughing, looking up at me. 

"do you want me to go?" he

"you wait out here," dewey dell says. 

"why cant i come in?" i say. "i want to come in, too." 

"you wait out here," she says. 

"all right," i say. 

dewey dell goes in. 

darl is my brother. darl went crazy 

the walk is harder than sitting on the ground. he is in the open door. he 

looks at me. "you want something?" he says. his head is slick. jewel's head is 

slick sometimes. cash's head is not slick. darl he went to jackson my brother 

darl in the street he ate a banana. wouldn't you rather have bananas? dewey 

dell said. you wait till christmas. it'll be there then. then you can see it. 

so we are going to have some bananas. we are going to have a bag full, me and 

dewey dell. he locks the door. dewey dell is inside. then the light winks out. 

he went to jackson. he went crazy and went to jackson both. lots of

he got in france at the war. in it it had a woman and a pig with two backs 
and no face. i know what that is. "is that why you are laughing, darl?" 
"yes yes yes yes yes yes." 

the wagon stands on the square, hitched, the mules motionless, the reins wrapped 
about the seat-spring, the back of the wagon toward the courthouse. it looks no 
different from a hundred other wagons there; jewel standing beside it and 
looking up the street like any other man in town that day, yet there is 
something different, distinctive. there is about it that un-mistakable air of 
definite and imminent departure that trains have, perhaps due to the fact that 
dewey dell and vardaman on the seat and cash on a pallet in the wagon bed are 
eating bananas from a paper bag. "is that why you are laughing, darl?"

so when we stopped there to borrow the shovels we heard the graphophone playing 
in the house, and so when we got done with the shovels pa says, "i reckon i 
better take them back." 

so we went back to the house. "we better take cash on to peabody's," jewel 
said. 

"it wont take but a minute," pa said. he got down from the wagon. the 
music was not playing now. 

"let vardaman do it," jewel said. "he can do it in half the time you can. 
or here, you let me--" 

"i reckon i better do it," pa says. "long as it was me that borrowed 
them." 

so we set in the wagon, but the music wasn't playing now. i reckon it's a 
good thing we aint got ere a one of them. i reckon i wouldn't never get no work 
done a-tall for listening to it. i dont know if a littl

can carry it with him wherever he wants. 

"what you reckon he's doing?" jewel says. "i could a toted them shovels 
back and forth ten times by now." 

"let him take his time," i said. "he aint as spry as you, remember." 
"why didn't he let me take them back, then? we got to get your leg fixed 
up so we can start home tomorrow." 

"we got plenty of time," i said. "i wonder what them machines costs on the 
installment."

he said,

"peabody just give me enough to pay the hotel with," i said. "we dont need 
nothing else, do we?" 



"no," pa said; "no. we dont need nothing." he stood there, not looking at 
me. 

"if it is something we got to have, i reckon maybe peabody," i said. 
"no," he said; "it aint nothing else. you all wait for me at the corner." 
so jewel got the team and come for me and they fixed me a pallet in the 
wagon and we drove across the square to the corner where pa said, and we was 
waiting there in the wagon, with dewey dell and vardaman eating bananas, when we 
see them coming up the street. pa was coming along with that kind of daresome 
and hangdog look all at once like when he has been up to something he knows ma

it was a fact. it made him look a foot taller, kind of holding his head 
up, hangdog and proud too, and then we see her behind him, carrying the other 
grip--a kind of duck-shaped woman all dressed up, with them kind of hard-looking 
pop eyes like she was daring ere a man to say nothing. and there we set watching 
them, with dewey dell's and vardaman's mouth half open and half-et bananas in 
their hands and her coming around from behind pa, looking at us like she da

graphophones. it was for a fact, all shut up as pretty as a picture, and everytime 
a new record would come from the mail order and us setting in the house in 
the winter, listening to it, i would think what a shame darl couldn't be to 
enjoy it too. but it is better so for him. this world is not his world; this 
life his life. 

"it's cash and jewel and vardaman and dewey dell," pa says, kind of 
hangdog and proud too, with his teeth and all, even if he wouldn't look at us. 
"meet mrs bundren," he says.
