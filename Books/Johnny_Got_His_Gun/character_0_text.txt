learn to forgive them because it stood to reason that if you
rushed away like he and howie had and went into the middle of a desert and decided you
would bury yourselves there for the whole three months' summer vacation why nobody
suffered but you. and that left the girl back there in shale city to go out with glen hogan
as much as she wanted to. tugging and stumbling and trying to breathe he suddenly had
an awful feeling come over him. he was asking himself a question. he was saying to
himself joe bonham have you beeen a fool?
somebody hollered out that it was quitting time and things began to dissolve slowly
in front of his eyes. when he got them back into focus he was lying on his stomach with
his head hanging over the side of the hand car and howie lying beside him. he
remembered looking down at the ground as it ran like water in front of his eyes and
hearing those mexicans singing. they were taking turns pumping away on that hand car
to get them back to the bunkhouse. he just lay there gagg

t him.
he had to stop the smotherings and the sinkings and the risings. he had to stop the fear
that made him want to yell and holler and laugh and claw himself to death with a pair of
hands that were rotting in some hospital dump.
he had to get hold of himself so he could think. this had been going on too long. his
stumps were healed over now. the bandages were gone. that meant time had passed. a
lot of time. enough time so that he had to come out of it and think. he had to think of
himself of joe bonham and what he was going to do next. he had to figure things out all
over again.
it was like a full grown man suddenly being stuffed back into his mother's body. he
was lying in stillness. he was completely helpless. somewhere sticking in his stomach
was a tube they fed him through. that was exactly like the womb except a baby in its
mother's body could look forward to the time when it would live.
he would be in this womb forever and ever and ever. he must remember that. he
must never expect or ho

gs you'd
never thought of before. things like for example going to war. you were so completely
alone on your hill that noise and people didn't enter in your figuring of things at all. you
figured only for yourself without considering a single little thing outside yourself. it
seemed that you thought clearer and that your answers made more sense. and even if
they didn't make sense it didn't matter because you weren't ever going to be able to do
anything about them anyhow.
he thought here you are joe bonham lying like a side of beef all the rest of your life
and for what? somebody tapped you on the shoulder and said come along son we're
going to war. so you went. but why? in any other deal even like buying a car or running
an errand you had the right to say what's there in it for me? otherwise you'd be buying
bad cars for too much money or running errands for fools and starving to death. it was a
kind of duty you owed yourself that when anybody said come on son do this or do that
you should stand

in love with laurette now wouldn't that be a fine thing me falling
in love with her and how would i break the news to my mother and father? and on the
other hand he would think why is it that all we do is talk what does she think i am? all
during the winter of that year and on through the spring he went down to see laurette
once maybe twice sometimes even three times a month. and each time he went down just
before he knocked on the door he would pull himself together and he would say to
himself joe bonham be a man this time. but laurette was so nice he couldn't figure out
how a fellow started things like that without seeming kind of dirty. so he never did.
when he graduated from high school he got a pair of gold cuff links through the mail
and all they had with them was a card that had the initial l written on it. he had a hell of
a time explaining to his folks who sent him the links but he prized them very highly and
he decided that tomorrow night after graduation he would go down to stumpy tel

e bankroll. why don't you get a job in some other
town and then come around in the fall after laurette is rested up and talk things over with
her? maybe you and laurette would be very happy. but by the time fall came he was
working in a bakery fifteen hundred miles away and he never saw laurette again.
there was a girl named bonnie. she clapped him on the back one day while he was
sitting in louie's drug store near the bakery having a coke. she slapped him on the back
and she said to him you're joe bonham ain't you joe bon-ham from shale city? well i'm
bonnie flannigan we used to go to school together jesus it's good to see somebody from
god's country. he looked at her and he couldn't remember her at all. oh yes he said i
remember you. she nodded and said you were ahead of me in school and you never
would give me a tumble how are you and why don't you come over to see me sometime?
i live in the bungalow court just three doors from the bakery. you work in the bakery i
know. i see some of the guys

erstood insanity he knew
all about it now. he understood the overpowering impulse to kill without having a reason
for killing the desire to beat against living skulls until they were pulp the passion to
strangle the lust for murder that was more beautiful more satisfying more imperative than
any lust he had known before. but he couldn't do it he couldn't kill he couldn't do
anything but tap.
inside his skull there was a normal man with arms and legs and everything that goes
with them. it was he joe bonham trapped in the darkness of his own skull rushing
frantically from ear-hole to ear-hole wherever in the skull there might be an opening.
like a wild animal he was trying to hammer his way out to escape into the world beyond.
he was trapped in his own brain tangled in the tissues and brain-matter kicking and
gouging and screaming to get out. and the only person in the world who could help him
had no idea of what he was doing.
he got to thinking this nurse is keeping me a prisoner. she is keeping
