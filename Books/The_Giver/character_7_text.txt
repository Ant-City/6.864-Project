nurturing center. then he checked those outside food
distribution; it was always fun to help with the deliveries, and he
hoped he would find his friend there so that they could go together
on the daily rounds, carrying the cartons of supplies into the
dwellings of the community. but he finally found asher's bicycle-
leaning, as usual, instead of upright in its port, as it should have
been-at the house of the old.





there was only one other child's bicycle there, that of a female
eleven named fiona. jonas liked fiona. she was a good student,
quiet and polite, but she had a sense of fun as well, and it didn't
surprise him that she was working with asher today. he parked his
bicycle neatly in the port beside theirs and entered the building.

"hello, jonas," the attendant at the front desk said. she handed him
the sign-up sheet and stamped her own official seal beside his
signature. all of his volunteer hours would be carefully tabulated at
the hall of open records. once, long ago, it was wh

nteer hours and would not, therefore, be
given his assignment. he had been permitted an additional month
in which to complete the hours, and then given his assignment
privately, with no applause, no celebration: a disgrace that had
clouded his entire future.

"it's good to have some volunteers here today," the attendant told
him. "we celebrated a release this morning, and that always throws
the schedule off a little, so things get backed up." she looked at a
printed sheet. "let's see. asher and fiona are helping in the
bathing room. why don't you join them there? you know where it is,
don't you?"

jonas nodded, thanked her, and walked down the long hallway. he
glanced into the rooms on either side. the old were sitting quietly,
some visiting and talking with one another, others doing handwork
and simple crafts. a few were asleep. each room was comfortably
furnished, the floors covered with thick carpeting. it was a serene
and




distribution where the daily work of the community occurred.

. the woman beside him, whose arm he held, was
hunched over as she shuffled along in her soft slippers. she looked
toward jonas and smiled, but her dark eyes were clouded and
blank. he realized she was blind.

he entered the bathing room with its warm moist air and scent of
cleansing lotions. he removed his tunic, hung it carefully on a wall
hook, and put on the volunteer's smock that was folded on a shelf.

"hi, jonas!" asher called from the corner where he was kneeling
beside a tub. jonas saw fiona nearby, at a different tub. she
looked up and smiled at him, but she was busy, gently washing a
man who lay in the warm water.

jonas greeted them and the caretaking attendants at work nearby.
then he went to the row of padded lounging chairs where others of
the old were waiting. he had worked here before; he knew what to
do.

"your turn, larissa," he said, reading the nametag on





the woman's robe. "i'll just start the water and then help you up." he
pressed the button on a nearby empty tub

dness; but the rule did not apply to
newchildren or the old. jonas was glad. it was a nuisance to keep
oneself covered while changing for games, and the required
apology if one had by mistake glimpsed another's body was always
awkward. he couldn't see why it was necessary. he liked the
feeling of safety here in this warm and quiet room; he liked the
expression of trust on the woman's face as she lay in the water
unprotected, exposed, and free.

from the corner of his eye he could see his friend fiona






help the old man from the tub and tenderly pat his thin, naked body
dry with an absorbant cloth. she helped him into his robe.

jonas thought larissa had drifted into sleep, as the old often did,
and he was careful to keep his motions steady and gentle so he
wouldn't wake her. he was surprised when she spoke, her eyes still
closed.

"this morning we celebrated the release of roberto," she told him.
"it was wonderful."

"i knew roberto!" jonas said. "i helped with his feeding the last
time

," jonas explained, trying to recreate
the odd dream in his mind. "i think i was in the bathing room at the
house of the old."

"that's where you were yesterday," father pointed out.

jonas nodded. "but it wasn't really the same. there was a tub, in
the dream. but only one. and the real bathing room has rows and
rows of them. but the room in the dream was warm and damp. and
i had taken off my tunic, but hadn't put on the smock, so my chest
was bare. i was perspiring, because it was so warm. and fiona





was there, the way she was yesterday."

"asher, too?" mother asked.

jonas shook his head. "no. it was only me and fiona, alone in the
room, standing beside the tub. she was laughing. but i wasn't. i
was almost a little angry at her, in the dream, because she wasn't
taking me seriously."

"seriously about what?" lily asked.

jonas looked at his plate. for some reason that he didn't
understand, he felt slightly embarrassed. "i think i

e to the stage accompanied by another child beaming
with pride to receive a little brother or sister, the way jonas had
when he was about to be a five.

asher poked jonas's arm. "remember when we got phillipa?" he
asked in a loud whisper. jonas nodded. it had only been last year.
asher's parents had waited quite a long time before applying for a
second child. maybe, jonas suspected, they had been so
exhausted by asher's lively foolishness that they had needed a little
time.

two of their group, fiona and another female named thea, were
missing temporarily, waiting with their parents to receive
newchildren. but it was rare that there was such an age gap
between children in a family unit.



when her family's ceremony was completed, fiona took the seat
that had been saved for her in the row ahead of asher and jonas.
she turned and whispered to them, "he's cute. but i don't like his
name very much." she made a face and giggled. fiona's new
brother had been

and today, now that the new elevens had been advanced this
morning, there were two eleven-nineteens. at the midday break he
had exchanged smiles with the new one, a shy female named
harriet.

but the duplication was only for these few hours. very soon he
would not be an eleven but a twelve, and age would no longer
matter. he would be an adult, like his parents, though a new one
and untrained still.

asher was four, and sat now in the row ahead of jonas. he would
receive his assignment fourth.

fiona, eighteen, was on his left; on his other side sat twenty, a
male named pierre whom jonas didn't like much. pierre was very
serious, not much fun, and a worrier and tattletale, too. "have you
checked the rules, jonas?" pierre was always whispering solemnly.
"i'm not sure that's within the rules." usually it was some foolish



thing that no one cared about-opening his tunic if it was a day with
a breeze; taking a brief try on a friend's bicycle, just to experience
the different feel of it.

 differences. they have determined your
futures."

she began to describe this year's group and its variety of
personalities, though she singled no one out by name. she
mentioned that there was one who had singular skills at caretaking,
another who loved newchildren, one with unusual scientific
aptitude, and a fourth for whom physical labor was an obvious
pleasure. jonas shifted in his seat, trying to recognize each
reference as one of his groupmates. the caretaking skills were no
doubt those of fiona, on his left; he remembered noticing the
tenderness with which she had bathed the old. probably the one
with scientific aptitude was benjamin, the male who had devised
new, important equipment for the rehabilitation center. he heard


nothing that he recognized as himself, jonas. finally the chief
elder paid tribute to the hard work of her committee, which had
performed the observations so meticulously all year. the
committee of elders stood and was acknowledged by applause.
jonas noticed asher

given. but he was more and more apprehensive as his own
approached. now the new twelves in the row ahead had all
received their badges. they were fingering them as they sat, and

jonas knew that each one was thinking about the training that lay
ahead. for some-one studious male had been selected as doctor,
a female as engineer, and another for law and justice-it would be
years of hard work and study. others, like laborers and
birthmothers, would have a much shorter training period.

eighteen, fiona, on his left, was ca]led. jonas knew she must be
nervous, but fiona was a calm female. she had been sitting quietly,
serenely, throughout the ceremony.

even the applause, though enthusiastic, seemed serene when
fiona was given the important assignment of caretaker of the old.
it was perfect for such a sensitive, gentle girl, and her smile was
satisfied and pleased when she took her seat beside him again.

jonas prepared himself to walk to the stage when the applause
ended and the chief

 never saw her again."





a silence fell over the room. they looked at each other. finally his
mother, rising from the table, said, "you've been greatly honored,
jonas. greatly honored."

alone in his sleepingroom, prepared for bed, jonas opened his
folder at last. some of the other twelves, he had



68



noticed, had been given folders thick with printed pages. he
imagined benjamin, the scientific male in his group, beginning to
read pages of rules and instructions with relish. he pictured fiona
smiling her gentle smile as she bent over the lists of duties and
methods that she would be required to learn in the days to come.

but his own folder was startlingly close to empty. inside there was
only a single printed sheet. he read it twice.

thought was frightening. what if others-adult-- had, upon becoming
twelves, received in their instructions the same terrifying
sentence?

what if they had all been instructed: you may lie?

his mind reeled. now, empowered to ask questions of utmost
rudeness and promised answers-he could, conceivably (though it
was almost unimaginable), ask someone, some adult, his father
perhaps: "do you lie?"

but he would have no way of knowing if the answer he received
were true.




"i go in here, jonas," fiona told him when they reached the front
door of the house of the old after parking their bicycles in the
designated area.

"i don't know why i'm nervous," she confessed. "i've been here so
often before." she turned her folder over in her hands.

"well, everything's different now," jonas reminded her.

"even the nameplates on our bikes," fiona laughed. during the
night the nameplate of each new twelve had been removed by the
maintenance crew and replaced with the style that indicated

scribe to his friends what he had
experienced there in the annex room. how could you describe a
sled without describing a hill and snow; and how could you describe
a hill and snow to someone who had never felt height or wind or
that feathery, magical cold?

even trained for years as they all had been in precision of
language, what words could you use which would give another the
experience of sunshine?

so it was easy for jonas to be still and to listen.

after school hours he rode again beside fiona to the house of the



old.



"i looked for you yesterday," she told him, "so we could ride home
together. your bike was still there, and i waited for a little while. but
it was getting late, so i went on home."

"i apologize for making you wait," jonas said.



90



"i accept your apology," she replied automatically.

"i stayed a little longer than i expected," jonas explained.

she pedaled forward silently, and he knew that she expected him to
tell her why. she expected him to describe his

first day of training.
but to ask would have fallen into the category of rudeness.

"you've been doing so many volunteer hours with the old," jonas
said, changing the subject. "there won't be much that you don't
already know."

"oh, there's lots to learn," fiona replied. "there's administrative
work, and the dietary rules, and punishment for disobedience-did
you know that they use a discipline wand on the old, the same as
for small children? and there's occupational therapy, and
recreational activities, and medications, and--"

they reached the building and braked their bikes.

"i really think i'll like it better than school," fiona confessed.

"me too," jonas agreed, wheeling his bike into its place.

she waited for a second, as if, again, she expecte

then she looked at her watch, waved, and hurried toward the




entrance.

jonas stood for a moment beside his bike, startled. it had
happened again: the thing that he thought of now as "seeing
beyond." this time it had been fiona who had undergone that
fleeting indescribable change. as he looked up and toward her
going through the door, it happened; she changed. actually, jonas
thought, trying to recreate it in his mind, it wasn't fiona in her
entirety. it

seemed to be just her hair. and just for that flickering instant.

he ran through it in his mind. it was clearly beginning to happen
more often. first, the apple a few weeks before. the next time had
been the faces in the audience at the auditorium, just two days
ago. now, today, fiona's hair.

frowning, jonas walked toward the annex. i will ask the giver, he
decided.

the old man looked up, smiling, when jonas entered the room. he

ed," he explained. "and i'd like to ask
you about it, if you don't mind."

"you may ask me anything."




jonas tried to sort it out in his mind so that he could explain it
clearly. "i think it's what you call seeing-beyond," he said.

the giver nodded. "describe it," he said.

jonas told him about the experience with the apple. then the
moment on the stage, when he had looked out and seen the same
phenomenon in the faces of the crowd.

"then today, just now, outside, it happened with my friend fiona.
she herself didn't change, exactly. but something about her
changed for a second. her hair looked different; but not in its
shape, not in its length. i can't

quite- " jonas paused, frustrated by his inability to grasp and
describe exactly what had occurred.

finally he simply said, "it changed. i don't know how, or why."

"that's why i was one minute late," he concluded, and looked
questioningly at the giver.

to his surprise, the old man asked him a question which seemed
unrelated to

atop the hill.

jonas grinned with delight, and blew his own steamy breath into
view. then, as he had been instructed, he looked down. he saw his
own hands, furred again with snow, holding the rope. he saw his
legs, and moved them aside for a glimpse of the sled beneath.

dumbfounded, he stared at it. this time it was not a fleeting
impression. this time the sled had--and continued to have, as he
blinked, and stared at it again-that same mysterious quality that
the apple had had so briefly. and fiona's hair. the sled did not
change. it simply was-whatever the thing was.



94



jonas opened his eyes and was still on the bed. the giver was
watching him curiously.

"yes," jonas said slowly. "i saw it, in the sled."

"let me try one more thing. look over there, to the bookcase. do
you see the very top row of books, the ones behind the table, on
the top shelf?"

jonas sought them with his eyes. he stared at them, and they
changed. but the change was fleeting. it slipped away the next
instant.

 
 ___________________________
 




"it happened," jonas said. "it happened to the books, but it went
away again."

"i'm right, then," the giver said. "you're beginning to see the color
red."

"the what?"

the giver sighed. "how to explain this? once, back in the time of
the memories, everything had a shape and size, the way things still
do, but they also had a quality called color.

"there were a lot of colors, and one of them was called red. that's
the one you are starting to see. your friend fiona has red hair-
quite distinctive, actually; i've noticed it before. when you
mentioned fiona's hair, it was the clue that told me you were
probably beginning to see the color red."

"and the faces of people? the ones i saw at the ceremony?"

the giver shook his head. "no, flesh isn't red. but it has red tones
in it. there was a time, actually-you'll see this in the memories
later-when flesh was many different colors. that was before we
went to sameness. today flesh is all the same, and what you

was the red tones.



95



probably when you saw the faces take on color it wasn't as deep or
vibrant as the apple, or your friend's hair."

the giver chuckled, suddenly. "we've never completely mastered
sameness. i suppose the genetic scientists are still hard at work
trying to work the kinks out. hair like fiona's must drive them
crazy."




jonas listened, trying hard to comprehend. "and the sled?" he said.
"it had that same thing: the color red. but it didn't change, giver. it
just was."

"because it's a memory from the time when color was."

"it was so-oh, i wish language were more precise! the red was so
beautiful!"

the giver nodded. "it is."

"do you see it all the time?"

"i see all of them. all the colors."

"will i?"

"of course. when you receive the memories. you have the capacity

was there someone there, waiting, who would receive the tiny
released twin? would it grow up elsewhere, not knowing, ever, that
in this community lived a being who looked exactly the same?

for a moment he felt a tiny, fluttering hope that he knew was quite
foolish. he hoped that it would be larissa, waiting. larissa, the old
woman he had bathed. he remembered her sparkling eyes, her soft
voice, her low chuckle. fiona had told him recently that larissa had
been released at a wonderful ceremony.

but he knew that the old were not given children to raise. larissa's
life elsewhere would be quiet and serene as befit the old; she
would not welcome the responsibility of nurturing a newchild who
needed feeding and care, and would likely cry at night.




"mother? father?" he said, the idea coming to him unexpectedly,
"why don't we put gabriel's crib in my room tonight? i know how to
feed and comfort him, and it wou

pasttime that used up their contained energy and ended only when
they all lay posed in freakish postures on the ground.

he had never recognized it before as a game of war. "attack!" the
shout came from behind the small storehouse where play
equipment was kept. three children dashed forward, their
imaginary weapons in firing position.

from the opposite side of the field came an opposing shout:
"counter-attack!" from their hiding places a horde of children-
jonas recognized fiona in the group-emerged, running in a
crouched position, firing across the field. several of them stopped,
grabbed their own shoulders and chests with exaggerated
gestures, and pretended to be hit. they dropped to the ground and
lay suppressing giggles.

feelings surged within jonas. he found himself walking forward
into the field.

"you're hit, jonas!" asher yelled from behind the tree. "pow! you're
hit again!"

jonas stood alone in the center of the field. several of the children
raised their he

 breathe.

one of the children raised an imaginary rifle and made an attempt
to destroy him with a firing noise. "pssheeew!" then they were all
silent, standing awkwardly, and the only sound was the sound of
jonas's shuddering breaths. he was struggling not to cry.

gradually, when nothing happened, nothing changed, the children
looked at each other nervously and went away. he heard the
sounds as they righted their bicycles and began to ride down the
path that led from the field. only asher and fiona remained.

"what's wrong, jonas? it was only a game," fiona said.

"you ruined it," asher said in an irritated voice.

"don't play it anymore," jonas pleaded.

"i'm the one who's training for assistant recreation director," asher
pointed out angrily. "games aren't your area of expertness."

"expertise," jonas corrected him automatically.

"whatever. you can't say what we play, even if you are going to be
the new receiver." asher looked warily at him. "i apologize for not
paying you the respect 
 
 ___________________________
 
you deserve," he mumbled.

"asher," jonas said. he was trying to speak carefully, and with
kindness, to say exactly what he wanted to say. "you had no way of
knowing this. i didn't know it myself until recently. but it's a cruel
game. in the past, there have--"




jonas sighed. it was no use. of course asher couldn't understand.

"i accept your apology, asher," he said wearily.

"do you want to go for a ride along the river, jonas?" fiona asked,
biting her lip with nervousness.

jonas looked at her. she was so lovely. for a fleeting instant he
thought he would like nothing better than to ride peacefully along
the river path, laughing and talking with his gentle female friend.
but he knew that such times had been taken from him now. he
shook his head. after a moment his two friends turned and went to
their bikes. he watched as they rode away.

jonas trudged to the bench beside the storehouse and sat down,
overwhelmed with feeling

s of loss. his childhood, his friendships,
his carefree sense of security-all of these things seemed to be
slipping away. with his new, heightened feelings, he was
overwhelmed by sadness at the way the others had laughed and
shouted, playing at war. but he knew that they could not
understand why, without the memories. he felt such love for asher
and for fiona. but they could not feel it back, without the memories.
and he could not give them those. jonas knew with certainty that
he could change nothing.

back in their dwelling, that evening, lily chattered merrily about the
wonderful holiday she had had, playing with her friends, having her
midday meal out of doors, and (she confessed) sneaking a very
short try on her father's bicycle.

"i can't wait till i get my very own bicycle next month. father's is too
big for me. i fell," she explained matter-

did not know what had happened ten years
before. "giver," he said, "tell me what happened. please."

the giver shrugged. "on the surface, it was quite simple. a
receiver-to-be was selected, the way you were. the selection went
smoothly enough. the ceremony was held, and the selection was
made. the crowd cheered, as they did for you. the new receiver
was puzzled and a little frightened, as you were."

"my parents told me it was a female."

the giver nodded.

jonas thought of his favorite female, fiona, and shivered. he
wouldn't want his gentle friend to suffer the way he had, taking on
the memories. "what was she like?" he asked the giver.

the giver looked sad, thinking about it. "she was a remarkable
young woman. very self-possessed and serene. intelligent, eager
to learn." he shook his head and drew a deep breath. "you know,



jonas, when she came to me in this room, when she presented
herself to begin her training-- "

jonas interrupted him with a question. "can you tell me her name?

or them. it's the same life that you would have, if you had
not been chosen as my successor." "but he hedxo me!" jonas
wept.

"it's what he was told to do, and he knows nothing else."

"what about you? do you lie to me, too?" jonas almost spat the
question at the giver.

"i am empowered to lie. but i have never lied to you."

jonas stared at him. "release is always like that? for people who
break the rules three times? for the old? do they kill the old, too?"

"yes, it's true."

"and what about fiona? she loves the old! she's in training to care
for them. does she know yet? what will she do when she finds out?
how will she feel?" jonas brushed wetness from his face with the
back of one hand.

"fiona is already being trained in the fine art of release," the giver
told him. "she's very efficient at her work, your red-haired friend.
feelings are not part of the life she's learned."

jonas wrapped his arms around himself and rocked his

lay beyond. but there was nothing left to do but continue. he
trudged upward.

as he approached the summit of the hill at last, something began to
happen. he was not warmer; if anything, he felt more numb and
more cold. he was not less exhausted; on the contrary, his steps
were leaden, and he could barely move his freezing, tired legs.

but he began, suddenly, to feel happy. he began to recall happy
times. he remembered his parents and his sister. he remembered
his friends, asher and fiona. he remembered the giver.

memories of joy flooded through him suddenly.

he reached the place where the hill crested and he could feel the
ground under his snow-covered feet become level. it would not be
uphill anymore.

"we're almost there, gabriel," he whispered, feeling quite certain
without knowing why. "i remember this place, gabe." and it was
true. but it was not a grasping of a thin and burdensome
recollection; this was different. this was something that he could
keep. it was a memory o
