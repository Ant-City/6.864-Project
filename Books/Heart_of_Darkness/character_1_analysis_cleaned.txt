[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER], like marlow, can be situated within a larger tradition.
[CHARACTER] resembles the archetypal "evil genius": the highly gifted
but ultimately degenerate individual whose fall is the stuff of
legend. [CHARACTER] is related to figures like faustus, satan in milton's paradise
lost, moby-dick's ahab, and wuthering heights's
heathcliff. like these characters, he is significant both for his
style and eloquence and for his grandiose, almost megalomaniacal
scheming. in a world of mundanely malicious men and "flabby devils,"
attracting enough attention to be worthy of damnation is indeed
something. [CHARACTER] can be criticized in the same terms that heart
of darkness is sometimes criticized: style entirely overrules
substance, providing a justification for amorality and evil.
in fact, it can be argued that style does not just override
substance but actually masks the fact that [CHARACTER] is utterly lacking
in substance. marlow refers to [CHARACTER] as "hollow" more than once.
this could be taken negatively, to mean that [CHARACTER] is not worthy
of contemplation. however, it also points to [CHARACTER]'s ability to
function as a "choice of nightmares" for marlow: in his essential
emptiness, he becomes a cipher, a site upon which other things can
be projected. this emptiness should not be read as benign, however,
just as [CHARACTER]'s eloquence should not be allowed to overshadow the
malice of his actions. instead, [CHARACTER] provides marlow with a set
of paradoxes that marlow can use to evaluate himself and the company's men.
indeed, [CHARACTER] is not so much a fully realized individual
as a series of images constructed by others for their own use. as
marlow's visits with [CHARACTER]'s cousin, the belgian journalist, and
[CHARACTER]'s fiancee demonstrate, there seems to be no true [CHARACTER]. to
his cousin, he was a great musician; to the journalist, a brilliant
politician and leader of men; to his fiancee, a great humanitarian
and genius. all of these contrast with marlow's version of the man,
and he is left doubting the validity of his memories. yet [CHARACTER],
through his charisma and larger-than-life plans, remains with marlow
and with the reader.
