 no men can suspect.

we do not wonder at this new sin of ours. it is our second transgression
of preference, for we do not think of all our brothers, as we must, but
only of one, and their name is liberty 5-3000. we do not know why we
think of them. we do not know why, when we think of them, we feel all of
a sudden that the earth is good and that it is not a burden to live. we
do not think of them as liberty 5-3000 any longer. we have given them
a name in our thoughts. we call them the golden one. but it is a sin to
give men names which distinguish them from other men. yet we call them
the golden one, for they are not like the others. the golden one are not
like the others.

and we take no heed of the law which says that men may not think of
women, save at the time of mating. this is the time each spring when all
the men older than twenty and all the women older than eighteen are sent
for one night to the city palace of mating. and each of the men have one
of the women assigned

 to them by the council of eugenics. children are
born each winter, but women never see their children and children never
know their parents. twice have we been sent to the palace of mating, but
it is an ugly and shameful matter, of which we do not like to think.

we had broken so many laws, and today we have broken one more. today, we
spoke to the golden one.

the other women were far off in the field, when we stopped at the hedge
by the side of the road. the golden one were kneeling alone at the moat
which runs through the field. and the drops of water falling from their
hands, as they raised the water to their lips, were like sparks of fire
in the sun. then the golden one saw us, and they did not move, kneeling
there, looking at us, and circles of light played upon their white
tunic, from the sun on the water of the moat, and one sparkling drop
fell from a finger of their hand held as frozen in the air.

then the golden one rose and walked to the hed

ge, as if they had heard a
command in our eyes. the two other street sweepers of our brigade were
a hundred paces away down the road. and we thought that international
4-8818 would not betray us, and union 5-3992 would not understand. so
we looked straight upon the golden one, and we saw the shadows of their
lashes on their white cheeks and the sparks of sun on their lips. and we
said:

"you are beautiful, liberty 5-3000."

their face did not move and they did not avert their eyes. only their
eyes grew wider, and there was triumph in their eyes, and it was not
triumph over us, but over things we could not guess.

then they asked:

"what is your name?"

"equality 7-2521," we answered.

"you are not one of our brothers, equality 7-2521, for we do not w

road away from us."

"your eyes," they said, "are not like the eyes of any among men."

and suddenly, without cause for the thought which came to us, we felt
cold, cold to our stomach.

"how old are you?" we asked.

they understood our thought, for they lowered their eyes for the first
time.

"seventeen," they whispered.

and we sighed, as if a burden had been taken from us, for we had been
thinking without reason of the palace of mating. and we thought that we
would not let the golden one be sent to the palace. how to prevent it,
how to bar the will of the councils, we knew not, but we knew suddenly
that we would. only we do not know why such thought came to us, for
these ugly matters bear no relation to us and the golden one. what
relation can they bear?

still, without reason, as we stood there by the hedge, we felt our lips
drawn tight with hatred, a sudden hatred for all our brother men. and
the golden one saw it and smiled slowly, and there was in their smile
the f

irst sadness we had seen in them. we think that in the wisdom of
women the golden one had understood more than we can understand.

then three of the sisters in the field appeared, coming toward the road,
so the golden one walked away from us. they took the bag of seeds, and
they threw the seeds into the furrows of earth as they walked away. but
the seeds flew wildly, for the hand of the golden one was trembling.

yet as we walked back to the home of the street sweepers, we felt that
we wanted to sing, without reason. so we were reprimanded tonight, in
the dining hall, for without knowing it we had begun to sing aloud some
tune we had never heard. but it is not proper to sing without reason,
save at the social meetings.

"we are singing because we are happy," we answered the one of the home
council who reprimanded us.

"indeed you are happy," they answered. "how else can men be

no single one can possess greater wisdom than the many scholars who are
elected by all men for their wisdom. yet we can. we do. we have fought
against saying it, but now it is said. we do not care. we forget all
men, all laws and all things save our metals and our wires. so much is
still to be learned! so long a road lies before us, and what care we if
we must travel it alone!

many days passed before we could speak to the golden one again. but
then came the day when the sky turned white, as if the sun had burst and
spread its flame in the air, and the fields lay still without breath,
and the dust of the road was white in the glow. so the women of the
field were weary, and they tarried over their work, and they were far
from the road when we came. but the golden one stood alone at the hedge,
waiting. we stopped and we saw that their eyes, so hard and scornful to
the world, were looking at us as if they would obey any

 word we might
speak.

and we said:

"we have given you a name in our thoughts, liberty 5-3000."

"what is our name?" they asked.

"the golden one."

"nor do we call you equality 7-2521 when we think of you."

"what name have you given us?" they looked straight into our eyes and
they held their head high and they answered:

"the unconquered."

for a long time we could not speak. then we said:

"such thoughts as these are forbidden, golden one."

"but you think such thoughts as these and you wish us to think them."

we looked into their eyes and we could not lie.

"yes," we whispered, and they smiled, and then we said: "our dearest
one, do not obey us."

they stepped back, and their eyes were wide and still.

"speak these words again," they whispered.

"which words?" we asked. but they did not answer, and we knew it.

"our dearest one," we whispered.

never have men said this to women.

"we shall bring the water to you," they said.

then they knelt by the moat, they gathered water in their two hands,
they rose and they held the water out to our lips.

we do not know if we drank that water. we only knew suddenly that their
hands were empty, but we were still holding our lips to their hands, and
that they knew it, but did not move.

we raised our head and stepped back. for we did not understand what had
made us do this, and we were afraid to understand it.

and the golden one stepped back, and stood looking upon their hands
in wonder. then the golden one moved away, even though no others were
coming, and they moved, stepping back, as if they could not turn from
us, their arms bent before them, as if they could not lower their hands.

ages. we alone. our hands. our mind. ours alone and only.

we know not what we are saying. our head is reeling. we look upon the

 our arms is like a living heart that gives us
strength. we have lied to ourselves. we have not built this box for the
good of our brothers. we built it for its own sake. it is above all our
brothers to us, and its truth above their truth. why wonder about this?
we have not many days to live. we are walking to the fangs awaiting us
somewhere among the great, silent trees. there is not a thing behind us
to regret.

then a blow of pain struck us, our first and our only. we thought of the
golden one. we thought of the golden one whom we shall never see again.
then the pain passed. it is best. we are one of the damned. it is best
if the golden one forget our name and the body which bore that name.




part eight

it has been a day of wonder, this, our first day in the forest.

we awoke when a ray of sunlight fell across our face. we wanted to leap
to our feet, as we have had to leap every morning of our life, but we
remembered suddenly that no bell had rung and that there was n

 bushes, and we waited. the steps came closer. and then we saw
the fold of a white tunic among the trees, and a gleam of gold.

we leapt forward, we ran to them, and we stood looking upon the golden
one.

they saw us, and their hands closed into fists, and the fists pulled
their arms down, as if they wished their arms to hold them, while their
body swayed. and they could not speak.

we dared not come too close to them. we asked, and our voice trembled:

"how did you come to be here, golden one?"

but they whispered only:

"we have found you...."

"how did you come to be in the forest?" we asked.

they raised their head, and there was a great pride in their voice; they
answered:

"we have followed you."

then we could not speak, and they said:

"we heard that you had gone to the uncharted forest, for the whole city
is speaking of it. so on the night of the day when we heard it, we ran
away from the home of the peasants. we found the marks of your feet
across the plai

ble. your
head is high, but our brothers cringe. you walk, but our brothers
crawl. we wish to be damned with you, rather than blessed with all our
brothers. do as you please with us, but do not send us away from you."

then they knelt, and bowed their golden head before us.

we had never thought of that which we did. we bent to raise the golden
one to their feet, but when we touched them, it was as if madness had
stricken us. we seized their body and we pressed our lips to theirs. the
golden one breathed once, and their breath was a moan, and then their
arms closed around us.

we stood together for a long time. and we were frightened that we had
lived for twenty-one years and had never known what joy is possible to
men.

then we said:

"our dearest one. fear nothing of the forest. there is no danger in
solitude. we have no need of our brothers. let us forget their good and
our evil, let us forget all things save that we are together and that
there is joy as a bond between u

s. give us your hand. look ahead. it is
our own world, golden one, a strange, unknown world, but our own."

then we walked on into the forest, their hand in ours.

and that night we knew that to hold the body of women in our arms is
neither ugly nor shameful, but the one ecstasy granted to the race of
men.

we have walked for many days. the forest has no end, and we seek no end.
but each day added to the chain of days between us and the city is like
an added blessing.

we have made a bow and many arrows. we can kill more birds than we need

r food; we find water and fruit in the forest. at night, we choose
a clearing, and we build a ring of fires around it. we sleep in the
midst of that ring, and the beasts dare not attack us. we can see their
eyes, green and yellow as coals, watching us from the tree branches
beyond. the fires smoulder as a crown of jewels around us, and smoke
stands still in the air, in columns made blue by the moonlight. we sleep
together in the midst of the ring, the arms of the golden one around us,
their head upon our breast.

some day, we shall stop and build a house, when we shall have gone far
enough. but we do not have to hasten. the days before us are without
end, like the forest.

we cannot understand this new life which we have found, yet it seems so
clear and so simple. when questions come to puzzle us, we walk faster,
then turn and forget all things as we watch the golden one following.
the shadows of leaves fall upon their arms, as they spread the branches

ne is evil. this have we been taught with our first breath. we
have broken the law, but we have never doubted it. yet now, as we walk
through the forest, we are learning to doubt.

there is no life for men, save in useful toil for the good of all their
brothers. but we lived not, when we toiled for our brothers, we were
only weary. there is no joy for men, save the joy shared with all their
brothers. but the only things which taught us joy were the power we
created in our wires, and the golden one. and both these joys belong
to us alone, they come from us alone, they bear no relation to all our
brothers, and they do not concern our brothers in any way. thus do we
wonder.

there is some error, one frightful error, in the thinking of men. what
is that error? we do not know, but the knowledge struggles within us,
struggles to be born. today, the golden one stopped suddenly and said:

"we love you."

but they frowned and shook their head and looked at us helplessly.

"no," they

d a strange roof flat as a floor. there was
more window than wall upon its walls, and the windows went on straight
around the corners, though how this kept the house standing we could not
guess. the walls were hard and smooth, of that stone unlike stone which
we had seen in our tunnel.

we both knew it without words: this house was left from the
unmentionable times. the trees had protected it from time and weather,
and from men who have less pity than time and weather. we turned to the
golden one and we asked:

"are you afraid?"

but they shook their head. so we walked to the door, and we threw it
open, and we stepped together into the house of the unmentionable times.

we shall need the days and the years ahead, to look, to learn, and to
understand the things of this house. today, we could only look and try
to believe the sight of our eyes. we pulled the heavy curtains from the
windows and we saw that the rooms were small, and we thought that not
more than twelve men could h

e do not know. and there were globes of glass
everywhere, in each room, the globes with the metal cobwebs inside, such
as we had seen in our tunnel.

we found the sleeping hall and we stood in awe upon its threshold. for
it was a small room and there were only two beds in it. we found no
other beds in the house, and then we knew that only two had lived here,
and this passes understanding. what kind of world did they have, the men
of the unmentionable times?

we found garments, and the golden one gasped at the sight of them. for
they were not white tunics, nor white togas; they were of all colors, no
two of them alike. some crumbled to dust as we touched them. but others
were of heavier cloth, and they felt soft and new in our fingers.

we found a room with walls made of shelves, which held rows of
manuscripts, from the floor to the ceiling. never had we seen such
a number of them, nor of such strange shape. they were not soft and
rolled, they had hard shells of cloth and leathe

r; and the letters on
their pages were so small and so even that we wondered at the men who
had such handwriting. we glanced through the pages, and we saw that they
were written in our language, but we found many words which we could not
understand. tomorrow, we shall begin to read these scripts.

when we had seen all the rooms of the house, we looked at the golden one
and we both knew the thought in our minds.

"we shall never leave this house," we said, "nor let it be taken from
us. this is our home and the end of our journey. this is your house,
golden one, and ours, and it belongs to no other men whatever as far as
the earth may stretch. we shall not share it with others, as we share
not our joy with them, nor our love, nor our hunger. so be it to the end
of our days."

"your will be done," they said.

then we went out to gather wood for the g

reat hearth of our home. we
brought water from the stream which runs among the trees under our
windows. we killed a mountain goat, and we brought its flesh to be
cooked in a strange copper pot we found in a place of wonders, which
must have been the cooking room of the house.

we did this work alone, for no words of ours could take the golden one
away from the big glass which is not glass. they stood before it and
they looked and looked upon their own body.

when the sun sank beyond the mountains, the golden one fell asleep on
the floor, amidst jewels, and bottles of crystal, and flowers of silk.
we lifted the golden one in our arms and we carried them to a bed, their
head falling softly upon our shoulder. then we lit a candle, and we
brought paper from the room of the manuscripts, and we sat by the
window, for we knew that we

i understood the blessed thing which i had called my curse. i understood
why the best in me had been my sins and my transgressions; and why i had
never felt guilt in my sins. i understood that centuries of chains and

i read many books for many days. then i called the golden one, and i

the first words she spoke were:

"i love you."

then i said:

"my dearest one, it is not proper for men to be without names. there was
a time when each man had a name of his own to distinguish him from all
other men. so let us choose our names. i have read of a man who lived
many thousands of years ago, and of all the names in these books, his is
the one i wish to bear. he took the light of the gods and he

all bearers of light must suffer. his name was prometheus."

"it shall be your name," said the golden one.

"and i have read of a goddess," i said, "who was the mother of the earth
and of all the gods. her name was gaea. let this be your name, my golden
one, for you are to be the mother of a new kind of gods."

"it shall be my name," said the golden one.

had seen the future when he chose me as his heir, as the heir of all the
saints and all the martyrs who came before him and who died for the same
cause, for the same word, no matter what name they gave to their cause
and their truth.

i shall live here, in my own house. i shall take my food from the earth
by the toil of my own hands. i shall learn many secrets from my books.
through the years ahead, i shall rebuil
