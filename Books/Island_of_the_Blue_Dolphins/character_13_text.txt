did, and when i said something, they would move around in a very funny way. in a way, too, that made pain come to my
throat because they were gay and sad also.
for a long time i called it otter as i had called rontu, dog. then i decided to give the otter a name. the name was mon-anee,
which means little boy with large eyes.
it was a hard task catching fish every day, especially if the wind was blowing and the waves were high. once when i could
catch only two and dropped them into the pool, mon-a-nee ate them quickly and waited for more. when he found that was all
i had he swam around in circles, looking at me reproachfully.
the waves were so high the next day that i could not fish on the reef even at low tide, and since i had nothing to give him i
did not go to the pool.
it was three days before i could catch fish and when i went there again the pool was deserted. i knew that he would leave
someday, but i felt bad that he had gone back to the sea and that i would never catch fish for him ag

 my hand.
for two moons i did not see him and then one morning while i was fishing he came suddenly out of the kelp. behind him
were two baby otter. they were about the size of puppies and they moved along so slowly that from time to time mon-a-nee
had to urge them on. sea otter cannot swim when they are first born, and have to hold on to their mother. little by little she
teaches her babies by brushing them away with her dippers, then swimming around them in circles until they learn to follow.
mon-a-nee came close to the reef and i threw a fish into the water. he did not snatch it as he usually did, but waited to see
what the young otter would do. when they seemed more interested in me than in food, and the fish started to swim away, he
seized it with his sharp teeth and tossed it in front of them.
i threw another fish into the water for mon-a- nee, but he did the same things as before. still the babies would not take the
food, and at last, tired of playing with it, swam over and began to nuzzl

e him.
only then did i know that mon-a-nee was their mother. otter mate for life and if the mother dies the father will often raise the
babies as best he can. this is what i thought had happened to mon-a-nee.
i looked down at the little family swimming beside the reef. 'mon-a-nee,' i said, 'i am going to give you a new name. it is
won-a-nee, which fits you because it means girl with the large eyes.' 
the young otter grew fast and soon were taking fish from my hand, but won-a-nee liked abalones better. she would let the
abalone i tossed to her sink to the bottom and then dive and come up holding it against her body, with a rock held in her
mouth. then she would float on her back and put the abalone on her breast and strike it again and again with the rock until
the shell was broken.
she taught her young to do this and sometimes i sat on the reef all the morning and watched the three of them pounding the
hard shells against their breasts. if all otters did not eat abalon

im that this ship had sunk in a great storm soon after it reached his country and that on the whole ocean thereabouts there
was no other. for this reason the white men had not come back for me.
on the tenth day we sailed. it was a morning of blue skies and no wind. we went straight towards the sun.
for a long time i stood and looked back at the island of the blue dolphins. the last thing i saw of it was the high headland. i
thought of rontu lying there beneath the stones of many colours, and of won-a-nee, wherever she was, and the little red fox
that would scratch in vain at my fence, and my canoe hidden in the cave, and of all the happy days. 
dolphins rose out of the sea and swam before the ship. they swam for many leagues in the morning through the bright water,
weaving their foam patterns. the little birds were chirping in their cage and rontu-aru sat beside me.
author's note
the island called in this book the island of the blue dolphins was first settled by indians in about 2000 b.c., but
