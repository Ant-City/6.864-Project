s he departs, there comes stealing in from the left a band of fifteen
    eastern women, the light of the sunrise streaming upon their long
    white robes and ivy-bound hair. they wear fawn-skins over the robes,
    and carry some of them timbrels, some pipes and other instruments.
    many bear the thyrsus, or sacred wand, made of reed ringed with ivy.
    they enter stealthily till they see that the place is empty, and
    then begin their mystic song of worship._

notes on the bacchae

introductory note


the _bacchae_, being from one point of view a religious drama, a kind of
"mystery play," is full of allusions both to the myth and to the
religion of dionysus.

"zeus."

approached is perhaps a mark of the unrevised condition of the play. the
same may be said of the repetitions in the prologue.

pp. 82-86, ll. 64-169.--this first song of the chorus covers a great
deal of bacchic doctrine and myth. the first strophe, "oh blessed he in
all wise," &c., describes the bliss of bacchic purity; the antistrophe
gives the two births of dionysus, from semelê and from the body of zeus,
mentioning his mystic epiphanies as bull and as serpent. the next
strophe is an appeal to thebes, the birthplace or "nurse" of the god's
mother, semelê; the antistrophe, an appeal to the cavern in crete, the
birthplace of zeus, the god's father, and the origi

martyr, like hippolytus, is left harsh and unpleasant, and very close in
type to the ordinary "tyrant" of greek tragedy (cf. p. 118). it is also
noteworthy, i think, that he is, as it were, out of tone with the other
characters. he belongs to a different atmosphere, like, to take a recent
instance, golaud in _pelléas et mélisande_.

p. 91, l. 263, injurious king, &c.]--it is a mark of a certain yielding
to stage convention in euripides' later style, that he allows the chorus
leader to make remarks which are not "asides," but are yet not heard or
noticed by anybody.

slew a dragon and sowed the teeth of it like seed in the "field of

of whom echîon was one.

p. 95, l. 370.--the goddess [greek: hosia], "purity," seems to be one of
the many abstractions which were half personified by philosophy and by
orphism. it is possible that the word is really adjectival, "immaculate
one," and originally an epithet of some more definite goddess, _e.g._ as
miss harrison suggests, of nemesis.

in this and other choruses it is very uncertain how the lines should be
distributed between the whole chorus, the two semi-choruses, and the
various individual choreutae.

original legend, marks of the thracian dress worn by the thracian
followers of dionysus, and notably by orpheus. the tradition became
fixed that pentheus wore such a robe and coif; and to the greeks of
euripides' time such a dress seemed to be a woman's. hence this turn of
the story (cf. above, p. 167).

p. 125, ll. 877-881.--the refrain of this chorus about the fawn is
difficult to interpret. i have practically interpolated the third line
("to stand from fear set free, to breathe and wait"), in order (1) to
show the connection of ideas; (2) to make clearer the meaning (as i
understand it) of the two orphic formulæ, "what is beautiful is beloved
for ever," and "a hand uplifted over the head of hate." if i am wrong,
the refrain is probably a mere cry for revenge, in the tone of the
refrain, "hither for doom and deed," on p. 132. it is

passages where there is a sharp antagonism between the two spirits of
the chorus, first, as furious bacchanals, and, secondly, as exponents of
the idealised bacchic religion of euripides, which is so strongly
expressed in the rest of this wonderful lyric.

p. 127, l. 920, is it a wild bull, this?]--pentheus, in his bacchic
possession, sees fitfully the mystic shapes of the god beneath the human
disguise. this second-sight, the exaltation of spirit, and the feeling
of supernatural strength come to pentheus as they came to the two old
men. but to them the change came

this lyric prepares us for what follows, especially for agâvê's
delusion, which otherwise might have been hard to understand. i have
tried to keep the peculiar metre of the original, the dochmiac, with a
few simple licences. the scheme is based on u-- --u-- or --uu --u-- the
latter being much commoner.

p. 133, ll. 997-1011.--the greater part of this chorus is generally
abandoned as unintelligible and corrupt. the last ten lines ("knowledge,
we are not foes," &c.) will, i think, make sense if we accept a very
slight conjecture of my own, [greek: aentôn], "let them blow", instead
of the impossible [greek: aei tôn]. the four lines before that ("a
strait pitiless mind," &c.) are an almost literal translation of the ms.
reading, which, however, is incorrect in metre, and therefore cannot be
exactly what euripides wrote.

ity and humanity, becomes increasingly marked
in all the victims of dionysus towards the end of the play, and
contrasts the more vividly with the god's pitilessness. cadmus is always
gentle, and always thinking of the sufferings of others; and, indeed, so
is agâvê, after her return to reason, though with more resentment
against the oppressor.

pp. 139-143, ll. 1165-1200.--this marvellous scene defies comment. but i
may be excused for remarking (1) that the psychological change of the
chorus is, to my mind, proved by the words of the original, and does not
in the least depend on my interpolated stage directions; (2) the
extraordinary exultation of agâvê is part of her bacchic possession. it
is not to be supposed that, if she had really killed a lion, such joy
would be the natural thing.

p. 141, _after_ l. 1183, _the leader tries to speak_, &c.]--it is also
possible that by some error of a scribe two lines have been omitted in
the ms. but i think the explanation given in
