Fool - 
      
        The Fool appears with Apemantus outside Timon's house while servants of creditors wait for their payments. The Fool makes parallels between those who go to creditors and those who go to prostitutes. As is often the case in Shakespeare, the Fool appears to be unconsciously wiser than most other characters.
