cedric the saxon  - 
      ivanhoe's father, a powerful saxon lord who has disinherited his son for following richard to the crusades. cedric is fiercely proud of his saxon heritage, and his first priority is to the prospects of his people--hence his desire to marry rowena to athelstane rather than to ivanhoe. cedric's unpolished manners make him the butt of jokes among his norman superiors, but he has a knack for making grand gestures to restore the balance--as when he shocks prince john by toasting richard at john's tournament feast.
