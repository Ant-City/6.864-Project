  anthonio. in sooth i know not why i am so sad,
it wearies me: you say it wearies you;
but how i caught it, found it, or came by it,
what stuffe 'tis made of, whereof it is borne,
i am to learne: and such a want-wit sadnesse makes of

that i haue much ado to know my selfe

   sal. your minde is tossing on the ocean,

   ant. i hold the world but as the world gratiano,
a stage, where euery man must play a part,
and mine a sad one

enter.

  ies. farewell good lancelet.
alacke, what hainous sinne is it in me
to be ashamed to be my fathers childe,
but though i am a daughter to his blood,

if thou keepe promise i shall end this strife,
become a christian, and thy louing wife.
