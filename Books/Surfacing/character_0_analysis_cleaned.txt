the [CHARACTER]
atwood avoids naming the [CHARACTER] of surfacing in order
to emphasize the universality of the [CHARACTER]'s feeling of alienation from
society. the causes and effects of the [CHARACTER]'s psychological transformation
remain somewhat mysterious. the [CHARACTER] feels emotionally numb, isolated by the
numerous roles she is supposed to play in her life. part of the cause is grief,
and part of it is due to spending too much time in the wilderness. but the
[CHARACTER]'s madness also stems in large part from systematic social alienation.
atwood explores a woman's place in all of its facets: as a human, a wife, a
religious person, a mother, and a sexual being. the [CHARACTER]'s madness seems to
arise from her anger at all of the standard roles forced upon women. her
response to this alienation is to become an animal. she sees animals not as
beasts without reason, but as graceful creatures that are better than humans at
peacefully coexisting with nature. the result of the [CHARACTER]'s transformation
is a greater understanding of her place in society. this understanding comes out
of necessity, because the [CHARACTER] realizes that complete withdrawal from
society will result in her death. however, the [CHARACTER] also reaches new
conclusions about how she will cope with society's ills. she resolves to rejoin
society without succumbing to the pressures that once subdued her.
