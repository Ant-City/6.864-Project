[CHARACTER] - 
                	olivia's
clever, daring young waiting-gentlewoman. [CHARACTER] is remarkably similar
to her antagonist, malvolio, who harbors aspirations of rising in
the world through marriage. but [CHARACTER] succeeds where malvolio fails--perhaps
because she is a woman, but, more likely, because she is more in
tune than malvolio with the anarchic, topsy-turvy spirit that animates
the play.
