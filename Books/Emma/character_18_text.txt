in which emma could not make up a card-table for him.
real, long-standing regard brought the westons and mr. knightley; and by mr. elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of mr. woodhouse’s drawing-room, and the smiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.
after these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were mrs. and miss bates, and mrs. goddard, three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield, and who were fetched and carried home so often, that mr. woodhouse thought it no hardship for either james or the horses. had it taken place only once a year, it would have been a grievance.
mrs. bates, the widow of a former vicar of highbury, was a very old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. she lived with her single daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the regard and respect whic

mrs. goddard was the mistress of a school—not of a seminary, or an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality, upon new principles and new systems—and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity—but a real, honest, old-fashioned boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might be sent to be out of the

 way, and scramble themselves into a little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. mrs. goddard’s school was in high repute—and very deservedly; for highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands. it was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church. she was a plain, motherly kind of woman, who had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to the occasi

s sake, in the power; though, as far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the absence of mrs. weston. she was delighted to see her father look comfortable, and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated.
as she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day, a note was brought from mrs. goddard, requesting, in most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring miss smith with her; a most welcome request: for miss smith was a girl of seventeen, whom emma knew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of her beauty. a very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.
harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody. somebody had placed her, several years back, at mrs. goddard’s school, and somebody had lat

emma allowed her father to talk—but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy. the happiness of miss smith was quite equal to her intentions. miss woodhouse was so great a personage in highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure;

her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents, but harriet could not tell. she was ready to tell every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. emma was obliged to fancy what she liked—but she could never believe that in the same situation she should not have discovered the truth. harriet had no penetration. she had been satisfied to hear and believe just what mrs. goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.
mrs. goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the school in general, formed naturally a great part of the conversation—and but for her acquaintance with the martins of abbey-mill farm, it must have been the whole. but the martins occupied her thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place. emma encourage

“well done, mrs. martin!” thought emma. “you know what you are about.”
“and when she had come away, mrs. martin was so very kind as to send mrs. goddard a beautiful goose—the finest goose mrs. goddard had ever seen. mrs. goddard had dressed it on a sunday, and asked all the three teachers, miss nash, and miss prince, and miss richardson, to sup with her.”

chapter vii

the very day of mr. elton’s going to london produced a fresh occasion for emma’s services towards her friend. harriet had been at hartfield, as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been talked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell. half a minute brought it all out. she had heard, as soon as she got back to mrs. goddard’s, that mr. martin had been there an hour before, and finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and on opening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs which she had lent elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this letter was from him, from mr. martin, and contained a direct proposal of marriage. “who could have thought it? she was so surprized she did not know what to do. yes, quit

“i shall never be invited to abbey-mill again,” was said in rather a sorrowful tone.
“nor, if you were, could i ever bear to part with you, my harriet. you are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared to abbey-mill.”
“and i am sure i should never want to go there; for i am never happy but at hartfield.”
some time afterwards it was, “i think mrs. goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened. i am sure miss nash would—for miss nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a linen-draper.”
“one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school, harriet. i dare say miss nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married. even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes. as to any thing superior for you, i suppose she is quite in the dark. the attentions of a c

harriet slept at hartfield that night. for some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself; and emma judged it best in every respect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possible just at present. she was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to mrs. goddard’s, but it was then to be settled that she should return to hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.
while she was gone, mr. knightley called, and sat some time with mr. woodhouse and emma, till mr. woodhouse, who had previously made up his mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, and was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of his own civility, to leave mr. knightley for that purpose. mr. knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about hi

“pray, mr. knightley,” said emma, who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech, “how do you know that mr. martin did not speak yesterday?”
“certainly,” replied he, surprized, “i do not absolutely know it; but it may be inferred. was not she the whole day with you?”

“whoever might be her parents,” said mr. knightley, “whoever may have had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society. after receiving a very indifferent education she is left in mrs. goddard’s hands to shift as she can;—to move, in short, in mrs. goddard’s line, to have mrs. goddard’s acquaintance. her friends evidently thought this good enough for her; and it was good enough. she desired nothing better herself. till you chose to turn her into a friend, her mind had no distaste for her own set, nor any ambition beyond it. she was as happy as possible with the martins in the summer. she had no sense of superiority then. if she has it now, you have given it. you have been no

“we think so very differently on this point, mr. knightley, that there can be no use in canvassing it. we shall only be making each other more angry. but as to my letting her marry robert martin, it is impossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, i think, as must prevent any second application. sh

harriet’s cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not to think of mr. martin, but to talk of mr. elton. miss nash had been telling her something, which she repeated immediately with great delight. mr. perry had been to mrs. goddard’s to attend a sick child, and miss nash had seen him, and he had told miss nash, that as he was coming back yesterday from clayton park, he had met mr. elton, and found to his great surprize, that mr. elton was actually on his road to london, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the whist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and mr. perry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby it was in him, their best player, to absent himself, an

enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literary pursuit which engaged harriet at present, the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with, into a thin quarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by her friend, and ornamented with ciphers and trophies.
in this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon. miss nash, head-teacher at mrs. goddard’s, had written out at least three hundred; and harriet, who had taken the first hint of it from her, hoped, with miss woodhouse’s help, to get a great many more. emma assisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as harriet wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in form as well as quantity.
mr. woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in. “so many cle

, and mr. knightley, their own especial set, were the only persons invited to meet them;—the hours were to be early, as well as the numbers few; mr. woodhouse’s habits and inclination being consulted in every thing.
the evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that mr. woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of december) had been spent by harriet at hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by mrs. goddard, emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. emma called on her the next day, and found her doom already signed with regard to randalls. she was very feverish and had a bad sore throat: mrs. goddard was full of care and affection, mr. perry was talked of, and harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement, though she could not speak of her loss without many tears.

“a sore-throat!—i hope not infectious. i hope not of a putrid infectious sort. has perry seen her? indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend. let me entreat you to run no risks. why does not perry see her?”
emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of

e, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in love with harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must dine out wherever he is asked. what a strange thing love is! he can see ready wit in harriet, but will not dine alone for her.”
soon afterwards mr. elton quitted them, and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at mrs. goddard’s for news of her fair friend, the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again, when he hoped to be able to give a better report; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour.
after a few minutes of entire silence between them, john knightley began with—

they arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and mr. elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject. mr. elton was all obligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed, that she began to think he must have received a different account of harriet from what had reached her. she had sent while dressing, and the answer had been, “much the same—not better.”
“my report from mrs. goddard’s,” said she presently, “was not so pleasant as i had hoped—‘not better’ was my answer.”
his face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered.
“oh! no—i am grieved to find—i was on the point of telling you that when i called at mrs. goddard’s door, which i did the very last thing before i returned to dress, i was told that miss smith was not better, by no means better, rather worse. very much grieved and concerned—i had flattered mysel

roper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her. she was vexed. it did appear—there was no concealing it—exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of harriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable! and she had difficulty in behaving with temper. he turned to mrs. weston to implore her assistance, “would not she give him her support?—would not she add her persuasions to his, to induce miss woodhouse not to go to mrs. goddard’s till it were certain that miss smith’s disorder had no infection? he could not be satisfied without a promise—would not she give him her influence in procuring it?”
“so scrupulous for others,” he continued, “and yet so careless for herself! she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself. is this fair, mrs. weston?—judge between us. have not i some right to complain? i am sure o

t supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening. mr. woodhouse talked over his alarms, and emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude.
she now resolved to keep harriet no longer in the dark. she had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman’s return. she went to mrs. goddard’s accordingly the very next day, to undergo the necessary penance of communication; and a severe one it was.—she had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding—to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred—and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her ideas on one subject, all her observations, all her convictions, all her prophecies for the last six weeks.

their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad for each, for all three. not one of them had the power of removal, or of effecting any material change of society. they must encounter each other, and make the best of it.
harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at mrs. goddard’s; mr. elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school; and it must be at hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth. where the wound had been given, there must the cure be found if anywhere; and emma felt that, till she saw her in the way of cure, there could be no true peace for herself.

the shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes, when in came harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the “oh! miss woodhouse, what do you think has happened!” which instantly burst forth, had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation. as the blow was given, emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness

emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting. it had been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining any influence to alarm. as harriet now lived, the martins could not get at her, without seeking her, where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her; for since her refusal of the brother, the sisters never had been at mrs. goddard’s; and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again, with any necessity, or even any power of speech.

“well, sir,” cried mr. weston, “as i took miss taylor away, it is incumbent on me to supply her place, if i can; and i will step to mrs. goddard in a moment, if you wish it.”
but the idea of any thing to be done in a moment, was increasing, not lessening, mr. woodhouse’s agitation. the ladies knew better how to allay it. mr. weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately arranged.
with this treatment, mr. woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual. “he should be happy to see mrs. goddard. he had a great regard for mrs. goddard; and emma should write a line, and invite her. james could take the note. but first of a

she meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at mr. cole’s; and without being able to forget that among the failings of mr. elton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with mr. cole.
her father’s comfort was amply secured, mrs. bates as well as mrs. goddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty, before she left the house, was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her power, by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine, for whatever unwilling self-denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal.—she had provided a plentiful dinner for them; she wi

ay no more; and with the hope of hartfield to reward him, returned with mrs. weston to mrs. bates’s door. emma watched them in, and then joined harriet at the interesting counter,—trying, with all the force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be it ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern. at last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.
“should i send it to mrs. goddard’s, ma’am?” asked mrs. ford.—“yes—no—yes, to mrs. goddard’s. only my pattern gown is at hartfield. no, you shall send it to hartfield, if you please. but then, mrs. goddard will want to see it.—and i could take the pattern gown home any day. but i shall want the ribbon directly—so it had better go to hartfield—at least the ribbon. you could make it into two parcels, mrs. ford, could not you?”
“it is not worth while, harriet, to give mrs. ford the trouble of two parcels.

“no more it is.”
“no trouble in the world, ma’am,” said the obliging mrs. ford.
“oh! but indeed i would much rather have it only in one. then, if you please, you shall send it all to mrs. goddard’s—i do not know—no, i think, miss woodhouse, i may just as well have it sent to hartfield, and take it home with me at night. what do you advise?”
“that you do not give another half-second to the subject. to hartfield, if you please, mrs. ford.”
“aye, that will be much best,” said harriet, quite satisfied, “i should not at all like to have it sent to mrs. goddard’s.”
voices approached the shop—or rather one voice and two ladies: mrs. weston and miss bates met them at the

no invitation came amiss to her. her bath habits made evening-parties perfectly natural to her, and maple grove had given her a taste for dinners. she was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms, at the poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being no ice in the highbury card-parties. mrs. bates, mrs. perry, mrs. goddard and others, were a good deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged. in the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party—in which her card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style—and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper o

rightened, and he was trying to cheer her.—the iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards asunder;—they were all three soon in the hall, and harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away.
a young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered, and surprizes be explained. such events are very interesting, but the suspense of them cannot last long. a few minutes made emma acquainted with the whole.
miss smith, and miss bickerton, another parlour boarder at mrs. goddard’s, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, and taken a road, the richmond road, which, though apparently public enough for safety, had led them into alarm.—about half a mile beyond highbury, making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each side, it became for a considerable stretch very retired; and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it, they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them, on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a party of

nging to him, and hardly able to speak, had just strength enough to reach hartfield, before her spirits were quite overcome. it was his idea to bring her to hartfield: he had thought of no other place.
this was the amount of the whole story,—of his communication and of harriet’s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.—he dared not stay longer than to see her well; these several delays left him not another minute to lose; and emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to mrs. goddard, and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to mr. knightley, he set off, with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself.
such an adventure as this,—a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain. so emma thought, at least. could a linguist, could a grammarian, could even a mathematician have seen what she did, have witn

ear, now you are come back, that will rather surprize you.”
“have i?” said he quietly, and looking at her; “of what nature?”
“oh! the best nature in the world—a wedding.”
after waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more, he replied,
“if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill, i have heard that already.”
“how is it possible?” cried emma, turning her glowing cheeks towards him; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might have called at mrs. goddard’s in his way.
“i had a few lines on parish business from mr. weston this morning, and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.”
emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more composure,
“you probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have had your suspicions.—i have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution.—i wish i had attended to it—but—(with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh) i seem to have been doom

ll arranged, it was all completed, and harriet was safe in brunswick square.
now emma could, indeed, enjoy mr. knightley’s visits; now she could talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how much might at that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself.
the difference of harriet at mrs. goddard’s, or in london, made perhaps an unreasonable difference in emma’s sensations; but she could not think of her in london without objects of curiosity and employment, which must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.
she would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which harriet had occupied. there was a communication before her, one which she only could be competent to make—the confession of her engagement to her father; but she would have

ment, because i never put up with any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer. are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which mr. martin and harriet now are?”
“i am quite sure,” he replied, speaking very distinctly, “that he told me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity, nothing doubtful, in the words he used; and i think i can give you a proof that it must be so. he asked my opinion as to what he was now to do. he knew of no one but mrs. goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends. could i mention any thing more fit to be done, than to go to mrs. goddard? i assured him that i could not. then, he said, he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day.”
“i am perfectly satisfied,” replied emma, with the brightest smiles, “and most sincerely wish them happy.”
“you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.”
“i hope so—for at that time i was a fool.”
“and i am
