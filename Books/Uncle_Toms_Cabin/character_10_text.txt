peared to lie in sick-headache, which sometimes would confine her to
her room three days out of six. as, of course, all family arrangements
fell into the hands of servants, st. clare found his menage anything but
comfortable. his only daughter was exceedingly delicate, and he feared
that, with no one to look after her and attend to her, her health and
life might yet fall a sacrifice to her motherâ€™s inefficiency. he had
taken her with him on a tour to vermont, and had persuaded his cousin,
miss ophelia st. clare, to return with him to his southern residence;
and they are now returning on this boat, where we have introduced them
to our readers.

and now, while the distant domes and spires of new orleans rise to our
view, there is yet time for an introduction to miss ophelia.

whoever has travelled in the new england states will remember, in some
cool village, the large farmhouse, with its clean-swept grassy yard,
shaded by the dense and massive foliage of the sugar maple; and remember
the air

on such a farm, in such a house and family, miss ophelia had spent a
quiet existence of some forty-five years, when her cousin invited her to
visit his southern mansion. the eldest of a large family, she was still
considered by her father and mother as one of â€œthe children,â€ and the
proposal that she should go to _orleans_ was a most momentous one to the
family circle. the old gray-headed father took down morseâ€™s atlas* out
of the book-case, and looked out the exact latitude and longitude; and
read flintâ€™s travels in the south and west,** to

the good mother inquired, anxiously, â€œif orleans wasnâ€™t an awful wicked
place,â€ saying, â€œthat it seemed to her most equal to going to the
sandwich islands, or anywhere among the heathen.â€

it was known at the ministerâ€™s and at the doctorâ€™s, and at miss
peabodyâ€™s milliner shop, that ophelia st. clare was â€œtalking aboutâ€
 going away down to orleans with her cousin; and of course the whole
village could do no less than help this very important process of
_talking about_ the matter. the minister, who inclined strongly to
abolitionist views, was quite doubtful whether such a step might not
tend somewhat to encourage the southerners in holding on to their
slaves; while the doctor, who was a stanch colonizationist, inclined to
the opinion that miss ophelia ought to go, to show the o

 think hardly of them, after all. he was of opinion, in
fact, that southern people needed encouraging. when however, the fact
that she had resolved to go was fully before the public mind, she was
solemnly invited out to tea by all her friends and neighbors for the
space of a fortnight, and her prospects and plans duly canvassed and
inquired into. miss moseley, who came into the house to help to do
the dress-making, acquired daily accessions of importance from the
developments with regard to miss opheliaâ€™s wardrobe which she had been
enabled to make. it was credibly ascertained that squire sinclare, as
his name was commonly contracted in the neighborhood, had counted out
fifty dollars, and given them to miss ophelia, and told her to buy any
clothes she thought best; and that two new silk dresses, and a bonnet,
had been sent for from boston. as to the propriety of this extraordinary
outlay, the public mind was divided,--some affirming that it was well
enough, all things considered, for once in

 oneâ€™s life, and others
stoutly affirming that the money had better have been sent to the
missionaries; but all parties agreed that there had been no such parasol
seen in those parts as had been sent on from new york, and that she had
one silk dress that might fairly be trusted to stand alone, whatever
might be said of its mistress. there were credible rumors, also, of a
hemstitched pocket-handkerchief; and report even went so far as to
state that miss ophelia had one pocket-handkerchief with lace all around
it,--it was even added that it was worked in the corners; but this
latter point was never satisfactorily ascertained, and remains, in fact,
unsettled to this day.

miss ophelia, as you now behold her, stands before you, in a very
shining brown linen travelling-dress, tall, square-formed, and
angular. her face was thin, and rather sharp in its outlines; the lips
compressed, like those of a person who is in the habit of making up
her mind definitel

more.
so, also, were her ideas with regard to most matters of practical
life,--such as housekeeping in all its branches, and the various
political relations of her native village. and, underlying all, deeper
than anything else, higher and broader, lay the strongest principle
of her being--conscientiousness. nowhere is conscience so dominant and
all-absorbing as with new england women. it is the granite formation,
which lies deepest, and rises out, even to the tops of the highest
mountains.

miss ophelia was the absolute bond-slave of the â€œ_ought_.â€ once make her
certain that the â€œpath of duty,â€ as she commonly phrased it, lay in
any given direction, and fire and water could not keep her from it. she
would walk straight down into a well, or up to a loaded cannonâ€™s mouth,
if she were only quite sure that there the path lay. her standard
of right was so high, so all-embracing, so minute, and making so few
concessions to human frailty, that, though she strove with heroic ardor
to reach i

t, she never actually did so, and of course was burdened with
a constant and often harassing sense of deficiency;--this gave a severe
and somewhat gloomy cast to her religious character.

but, how in the world can miss ophelia get along with augustine
st. clare,--gay, easy, unpunctual, unpractical, sceptical,--in
short,--walking with impudent and nonchalant freedom over every one of
her most cherished habits and opinions?

to tell the truth, then, miss ophelia loved him. when a boy, it had been
hers to teach him his catechism, mend his clothes, comb his hair, and
bring him up generally in the way he should go; and her heart having
a warm side to it, augustine had, as he usually did with most people,
monopolized a large share of it for himself, and therefore it was that
he succeeded very easily in persuading her that the â€œpath of dutyâ€ lay
in the direction of new orleans, and that she must go with him to take
care of eva, and keep everything from

apa would buy some more of whatever it was.â€

â€œmercy on us, child,--what a way!â€

â€œit was a very easy way, aunty,â€ said eva.

â€œitâ€™s a dreadful shiftless one,â€ said aunty.

â€œwhy, aunty, whatâ€™ll you do now?â€ said eva; â€œthat trunk is too full to
be shut down.â€

â€œit _must_ shut down,â€ said aunty, with the air of a general, as she
squeezed the things in, and sprung upon the lid;--still a little gap
remained about the mouth of the trunk.

â€œget up here, eva!â€ said miss ophelia, courageously; â€œwhat has been done
can be done again. this trunk has _got to be_ shut and locked--there are
no two ways about it.â€

and the trunk, intimidated, doubtless, by this resolute statement, gave
in. the hasp snapped sharply in its hole, and miss ophelia turned the
key, and pocketed it in triumph.

â€œnow weâ€™re ready. whereâ€™s your papa? i think it time this baggage was
set out. do look out, eva, and see if you see your papa.â€

â€œo, yes, heâ€™s down the other end of the gentle

â€œpapa never is in a hurry about anything,â€ said eva, â€œand we havenâ€™t
come to the landing. do step on the guards, aunty. look! thereâ€™s our
house, up that street!â€

the boat now began, with heavy groans, like some vast, tired monster,
to prepare to push up among the multiplied steamers at the levee. eva
joyously pointed out the various spires, domes, and way-marks, by which
she recognized her native city.

â€œyes, yes, dear; very fine,â€ said miss ophelia. â€œbut mercy on us! the
boat has stopped! where is your father?â€

and now ensued the usual turmoil of landing--waiters running twenty ways
at once--men tugging trunks, carpet-bags, boxes--women anxiously calling
to their children, and everybody crowding in a dense mass to the plank
towards the landing.

miss ophelia seated herself resolutely on the lately vanquished trunk,
and marshalling all her goods and chattels in fine military order,
seemed resolved to defend them to the last.

 was enough to
strike dismay even into a hackman, wondering to eva, in each interval,
â€œwhat upon earth her papa could be thinking of; he couldnâ€™t have fallen
over, now,--but something must have happened;â€--and just as she had
begun to work herself into a real distress, he came up, with his usually
careless motion, and giving eva a quarter of the orange he was eating,
said,

â€œwell, cousin vermont, i suppose you are all ready.â€

â€œiâ€™ve been ready, waiting, nearly an hour,â€ said miss ophelia; â€œi began
to be really concerned about you.

â€œthatâ€™s a clever fellow, now,â€ said he. â€œwell, the carriage is waiting,
and the crowd are now off, so that one can walk out in a decent and
christian manner, and not be pushed and shoved. here,â€ he added to a
driver who stood behind him, â€œtake these things.â€

â€œiâ€™ll go and see to his putting them in,â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œo, pshaw, cousin, whatâ€™s the use?â€ said st. clare.

â€œwell, at any rate, iâ€™ll carry this, and this,

and this,â€ said miss
ophelia, singling out three boxes and a small carpet-bag.

â€œmy dear miss vermont, positively you mustnâ€™t come the green mountains
over us that way. you must adopt at least a piece of a southern
principle, and not walk out under all that load. theyâ€™ll take you for a
waiting-maid; give them to this fellow; heâ€™ll put them down as if they
were eggs, now.â€

miss ophelia looked despairingly as her cousin took all her treasures
from her, and rejoiced to find herself once more in the carriage with
them, in a state of preservation.

â€œwhereâ€™s tom?â€ said eva.

â€œo, heâ€™s on the outside, pussy. iâ€™m going to take tom up to mother for
a peace-offering, to make up for that drunken fellow that upset the
carriage.â€

â€œo, tom will make a splendid driver, i know,â€ said eva; â€œheâ€™ll never get
drunk.â€

the carriage stopped in front of an ancient mansion, b

and fragrance around it.

the galleries that surrounded the court were festooned with a curtain
of some kind of moorish stuff, and could be drawn down at pleasure, to
exclude the beams of the sun. on the whole, the appearance of the place
was luxurious and romantic.

as the carriage drove in, eva seemed like a bird ready to burst from a
cage, with the wild eagerness of her delight.

â€œo, isnâ€™t it beautiful, lovely! my own dear, darling home!â€ she said to
miss ophelia. â€œisnâ€™t it beautiful?â€

â€œâ€˜t is a pretty place,â€ said miss ophelia, as she alighted; â€œthough it
looks rather old and heathenish to me.â€

tom got down from the carriage, and looked about with an air of calm,
still enjoyment. the negro, it must be remembered, is an exotic of the
most gorgeous and superb countries of the world, and he has, deep in his
heart, a passion for all that is splendid, rich, and fanciful; a passion
which, rudely indulged by an untrained taste, draws on them

ressible grace and suavity.

â€œah, adolph, is it you?â€ said his master, offering his hand to him;
â€œhow are you, boy?â€ while adolph poured forth, with great fluency, an
extemporary speech, which he had been preparing, with great care, for a
fortnight before.

â€œwell, well,â€ said st. clare, passing on, with his usual air of
negligent drollery, â€œthatâ€™s very well got up, adolph. see that the
baggage is well bestowed. iâ€™ll come to the people in a minute;â€ and,
so saying, he led miss ophelia to a large parlor that opened on the
verandah.

while this had been passing, eva had flown like a bird, through the
porch and parlor, to a little boudoir opening likewise on the verandah.

a tall, dark-eyed, sallow woman, half rose from a couch on which she was
reclining.

â€œmamma!â€ said eva, in a sort of a rapture, throwing herself on her neck,
and embracing her over and over again.

â€œthatâ€™ll do,--take care, child,--donâ€™t, you make my head ache,â€ said the
mother, after she had langu

an, of very respectable
appearance, stood foremost, in a tremor of expectation and joy, at the
door.

â€œo, thereâ€™s mammy!â€ said eva, as she flew across the room; and, throwing
herself into her arms, she kissed her repeatedly.

this woman did not tell her that she made her head ache, but, on the
contrary, she hugged her, and laughed, and cried, till her sanity was a
thing to be doubted of; and when released from her, eva flew from one
to another, shaking hands and kissing, in a way that miss ophelia
afterwards declared fairly turned her stomach.

â€œwell!â€ said miss ophelia, â€œyou southern children can do something that
_i_ couldnâ€™t.â€

â€œwhat, now, pray?â€ said st. clare.

â€œwell, i want to be kind to everybody, and i wouldnâ€™t have anything
hurt; but as to kissing--â€

â€œniggers,â€ said st. clare, â€œthat youâ€™re not up to,--hey?â€

â€œyes, thatâ€™s it. how can she?â€

st. clare laughed, as he went into the passage. â€œhalloa, here, whatâ€™s

â€œhang the woman!â€ said st. clare, mentally; but aloud he added, â€œcome,
now, marie, what do you think of the likeness? donâ€™t be nonsensical,
now.â€

â€œitâ€™s very inconsiderate of you, st. clare,â€ said the lady, â€œto insist
on my talking and looking at things. you know iâ€™ve been lying all day
with the sick-headache; and thereâ€™s been such a tumult made ever since
you came, iâ€™m half dead.â€

â€œyouâ€™re subject to the sick-headache, maâ€™am!â€ said miss ophelia,
suddenly rising from the depths of the large arm-chair, where she had
sat quietly, taking an inventory of the furniture, and calculating its
expense.

â€œyes, iâ€™m a perfect martyr to it,â€ said the lady.

â€œjuniper-berry tea is good for sick-headache,â€ said miss ophelia; â€œat
least, auguste, deacon abraham perryâ€™s wife, used to say so; and she was
a great nurse.â€

â€œiâ€™ll have the first juniper-berries that get ripe in our garden by

journey. dolph,â€ he added, â€œtell mammy to come here.â€ the decent mulatto
woman whom eva had caressed so rapturously soon entered; she was dressed
neatly, with a high red and yellow turban on her head, the recent gift
of eva, and which the child had been arranging on her head. â€œmammy,â€
 said st. clare, â€œi put this lady under your care; she is tired,
and wants rest; take her to her chamber, and be sure she is made
comfortable,â€ and miss ophelia disappeared in the rear of mammy.

tomâ€™s mistress and her opinions

â€œand now, marie,â€ said st. clare, â€œyour golden days are dawning. here is
our practical, business-like new england cousin, who will take the
whole budget of cares off your shoulders, and give you time to refresh
yourself, and grow young and handsome. the ceremony of delivering the
keys had better come off forthwith.â€

this remark was made at the breakfast-table, a few mornings after miss
ophelia had arri
 
 ___________________________
 
â€™t you let jane or rosa take her place, a night or two,â€ said
st. clare, â€œand let her rest?â€

â€œhow can you propose it?â€ said marie. â€œst. clare, you really are
inconsiderate. so nervous as i am, the least breath disturbs me; and a
strange hand about me would drive me absolutely frantic. if mammy felt
the interest in me she ought to, sheâ€™d wake easier,--of course, she
would. iâ€™ve heard of people who had such devoted servants, but it never
was _my_ luck;â€ and marie sighed.

miss ophelia had listened to this conversation with an air of shrewd,
observant gravity; and she still kept her lips tightly compressed, as
if determined fully to ascertain her longitude and position, before she
committed herself.

â€œnow, mammy has a _sort_ of goodness,â€ said marie; â€œsheâ€™s smooth and
respectful, but sheâ€™s selfish at heart. now, she never will be done
fidgeting and worrying about that husband of hers. you see, when i was
married and came to live here, of course, i had to bring her w

 it, and married mammy to somebody else; but i was foolish
and indulgent, and didnâ€™t want to insist. i told mammy, at the time,
that she mustnâ€™t ever expect to see him more than once or twice in her
life again, for the air of fatherâ€™s place doesnâ€™t agree with my health,
and i canâ€™t go there; and i advised her to take up with somebody else;
but no--she wouldnâ€™t. mammy has a kind of obstinacy about her, in spots,
that everybody donâ€™t see as i do.â€

â€œhas she children?â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œyes; she has two.â€

â€œi suppose she feels the separation from them?â€

â€œwell, of course, i couldnâ€™t bring them. they were little dirty
things--i couldnâ€™t have them about; and, besides, they took up too
much of her time; but i believe that mammy has always kept up a sort of
sulkiness about this. she wonâ€™t marry anybody else; and i do believe,
now, though she knows how necessary she is to me, and how feeble my
health is, she would go back to her husband tomorrow, if she only coul

i _do_, indeed,â€ said marie; â€œthey are just so selfish, now, the best of

â€œitâ€™s distressing to reflect upon,â€ said st. clare, dryly.

miss ophelia looked keenly at him, and saw the flush of mortification
and repressed vexation, and the sarcastic curl of the lip, as he spoke.

â€œnow, mammy has always been a pet with me,â€ said marie. â€œi wish some of
your northern servants could look at her closets of dresses,--silks and
muslins, and one real linen cambric, she has hanging there. iâ€™ve worked
sometimes whole afternoons, trimming her caps, and getting her ready
to go to a party. as to abuse, she donâ€™t know what it is. she never was

nights, thinking--â€

â€œo, nonsense, child--nonsense!â€ said marie; â€œyou are such a strange
child!â€

â€œbut may i, mamma? i think,â€ she said, timidly, â€œthat mammy isnâ€™t well.
she told me her head ached all the time, lately.â€

â€œo, thatâ€™s just one of mammyâ€™s fidgets! mammy is just like all the rest
of them--makes such a fuss about every little headache or finger-ache;
itâ€™ll never do to encourage it--never! iâ€™m principled about this
matter,â€ said she, turning to miss ophelia; â€œyouâ€™ll find the necessity
of it. if you encourage servants in giving way to every little
disagreeable feeling, and complaining of every little ailment, youâ€™ll
have your hands full. i never complain myself--nobody knows what i
endure. i feel it a duty to bear it quietly, and i do.â€

miss opheliaâ€™s round eyes expressed an undisguised amazement at this
peroration, which struck st. clare as so supremely ludicrous, that he
burst into a loud laugh.

â€œst. clare always laughs when i make 
 
 ___________________________
 
the least allusion to my ill
health,â€ said marie, with the voice of a suffering martyr. â€œi only
hope the day wonâ€™t come when heâ€™ll remember it!â€ and marie put her
handkerchief to her eyes.

of course, there was rather a foolish silence. finally, st. clare got
up, looked at his watch, and said he had an engagement down street. eva
tripped away after him, and miss ophelia and marie remained at the table
alone.

â€œnow, thatâ€™s just like st. clare!â€ said the latter, withdrawing her
handkerchief with somewhat of a spirited flourish when the criminal to
be affected by it was no longer in sight. â€œhe never realizes, never
can, never will, what i suffer, and have, for years. if i was one of the
complaining sort, or ever made any fuss about my ailments, there would
be some reason for it. men do get tired, naturally, of a complaining
wife. but iâ€™ve kept things to

 myself, and borne, and borne, till st.
clare has got in the way of thinking i can bear anything.â€

miss ophelia did not exactly know what she was expected to answer to
this.

while she was thinking what to say, marie gradually wiped away her
tears, and smoothed her plumage in a general sort of way, as a dove
might be supposed to make toilet after a shower, and began a housewifely
chat with miss ophelia, concerning cupboards, closets, linen-presses,
store-rooms, and other matters, of which the latter was, by common
understanding, to assume the direction,--giving her so many cautious
directions and charges, that a head less systematic and business-like
than miss opheliaâ€™s would have been utterly dizzied and confounded.

â€œand now,â€ said marie, â€œi believe iâ€™ve told you everything; so that,
when my next sick turn comes on, youâ€™ll be able to go forward entirely,
without consulting me;--

only about eva,--she requires watching.â€

â€œshe seems to be a good child, very,â€ said miss ophelia; â€œi never saw a
better child.â€

â€œevaâ€™s peculiar,â€ said her mother, â€œvery. there are things about her so
singular; she isnâ€™t like me, now, a particle;â€ and marie sighed, as if
this was a truly melancholy consideration.

miss ophelia in her own heart said, â€œi hope she isnâ€™t,â€ but had prudence
enough to keep it down.

â€œeva always was disposed to be with servants; and i think that well
enough with some children. now, i always played with fatherâ€™s little
negroes--it never did me any harm. but eva somehow always seems to put
herself on an equality with every creature that comes near her. itâ€™s a
strange thing about the child. i never have been able to break her of
it. st. clare, i believe, encourages her in it. the f

act is, st. clare
indulges every creature under this roof but his own wife.â€

again miss ophelia sat in blank silence.

â€œnow, thereâ€™s no way with servants,â€ said marie, â€œbut to _put them
down_, and keep them down. it was always natural to me, from a child.
eva is enough to spoil a whole house-full. what she will do when she
comes to keep house herself, iâ€™m sure i donâ€™t know. i hold to being
_kind_ to servants--i always am; but you must make â€˜em _know their
place_. eva never does; thereâ€™s no getting into the childâ€™s head the
first beginning of an idea what a servantâ€™s pl

ace is! you heard her
offering to take care of me nights, to let mammy sleep! thatâ€™s just a
specimen of the way the child would be doing all the time, if she was
left to herself.â€

â€œwhy,â€ said miss ophelia, bluntly, â€œi suppose you think your servants
are human creatures, and ought to have some rest when they are tired.â€

â€œcertainly, of course. iâ€™m very particular in letting them have
everything that comes convenient,--anything that doesnâ€™t put one at
all out of the way, you know. mammy can make up her sleep, some time
or other; thereâ€™s no difficulty about that. sheâ€™s the sleepiest concern
that ever i saw; sewing, standing, or sitting, that creature will go to
sleep, and sleep anywhe

re and everywhere. no danger but mammy gets sleep
enough. but this treating servants as if they were exotic flowers, or
china vases, is really ridiculous,â€ said marie, as she plunged languidly
into the depths of a voluminous and pillowy lounge, and drew towards her
an elegant cut-glass vinaigrette.

â€œyou see,â€ she continued, in a faint and lady-like voice, like the last
dying breath of an arabian jessamine, or something equally ethereal,
â€œyou see, cousin ophelia, i donâ€™t often speak of myself. it isnâ€™t my
_habit_; â€˜t isnâ€™t agreeable to me. in fact, i havenâ€™t strength to do
it. but there are points where st. clare and i differ. st. clare never
understood me, never appreciated me. i think it lies at the root of all
my ill health. st. clare means well, i am bound to believe; but men are
constitutionally selfish and inconsiderate to woman. that, at least, is
my impression.â€

miss ophelia, who had not a small share of the genuine new england

hat, come what will,
there shall not be a blow struck in this house, except what he or i
strike; and he does it in a way that i really dare not cross him. well,
you may see what that leads to; for st. clare wouldnâ€™t raise his hand,
if every one of them walked over him, and i--you see how cruel it would
be to require me to make the exertion. now, you know these servants are
nothing but grown-up children.â€

â€œi donâ€™t know anything about it, and i thank the lord that i donâ€™t!â€
 said miss ophelia, shortly.

â€œwell, but you will have to know something, and know it to your cost,
if you stay here. you donâ€™t know what a provoking, stupid, careless,
unreasonable, childish, ungrateful set of wretches they are.â€

marie seemed wonderfully supported, always, when she got upon this
topic; and she now opened her eyes, and seemed quite to forget her
languor.

â€œyou donâ€™t know, and you canâ€™t, the daily, hourly trials that beset
a housekeeper from them, everywhere and every way. but itâ€™s

no use to
complain to st. clare. he talks the strangest stuff. he says we have
made them what they are, and ought to bear with them. he says their
faults are all owing to us, and that it would be cruel to make the fault
and punish it too. he says we shouldnâ€™t do any better, in their place;
just as if one could reason from them to us, you know.â€

â€œdonâ€™t you believe that the lord made them of one blood with us?â€ said
miss ophelia, shortly.

â€œno, indeed not i! a pretty story, truly! they are a degraded race.â€

â€œdonâ€™t you think theyâ€™ve got immortal souls?â€ said miss ophelia, with
increasing indignation.

â€œo, well,â€ said marie, yawning, â€œthat, of course--nobody doubts that.
but as to putting them on any sort of equality with us, you know, as if
we could be compared, why, itâ€™s impossible! now, st. clare really has
talked to me as if keeping mammy from her husband was like keeping me
from mine. thereâ€™s

 with my
weak health, and all i suffer, to let mammy go back, and take somebody
else in her place. that was a little too much even for _me_ to bear. i
donâ€™t often show my feelings, i make it a principle to endure everything
in silence; itâ€™s a wifeâ€™s hard lot, and i bear it. but i did break out,
that time; so that he has never alluded to the subject since. but i know
by his looks, and little things that he says, that he thinks so as much
as ever; and itâ€™s so trying, so provoking!â€

miss ophelia looked very much as if she was afraid she should say
something; but she rattled away with her needles in a way that had
volumes of meaning in it, if marie could only have understood it.

â€œso, you just see,â€ she continued, â€œwhat youâ€™ve got to manage. a
household without any rule; where servants have it all their own way, do
what they please, and have what they please, except so far as i, with
my feeble health, have kept up government. i keep my cowhide about, and
sometimes i do lay it on

; but the exertion is always too much for me. if
st. clare would only have this thing done as others do--â€

â€œand howâ€™s that?â€

â€œwhy, send them to the calaboose, or some of the other places to be
flogged. thatâ€™s the only way. if i wasnâ€™t such a poor, feeble piece, i
believe i should manage with twice the energy that st. clare does.â€

â€œand how does st. clare contrive to manage?â€ said miss ophelia. â€œyou say
he never strikes a blow.â€

â€œwell, men have a more commanding way, you know; it is easier for
them; besides, if you ever looked full in his eye, itâ€™s peculiar,--that
eye,--and if he speaks decidedly, thereâ€™s a kind of flash. iâ€™m afraid of
it, myself; and the servants know they must mind. i couldnâ€™t do as much
by a regular storm and scolding as st. clare can by one turn of his eye,
if once he is in earnest. o, thereâ€™s no trouble about st. clare; thatâ€™s
the reason heâ€™

 about it, and i had to talk to him like a father,
to bring him round.â€

â€œo! st. clare, when will you learn how to treat your servants? itâ€™s
abominable, the way you indulge them!â€ said marie.

â€œwhy, after all, whatâ€™s the harm of the poor dogâ€™s wanting to be like
his master; and if i havenâ€™t brought him up any better than to find his
chief good in cologne and cambric handkerchiefs, why shouldnâ€™t i give
them to him?â€

â€œand why havenâ€™t you brought him up better?â€ said miss ophelia, with
blunt determination.

â€œtoo much trouble,--laziness, cousin, laziness,--which ruins more souls
than you can shake a stick at. if it werenâ€™t for laziness, i should have
been a perfect angel, myself. iâ€™m inclined to think that laziness is
what your old dr. botherem, up in vermont, used to call the â€˜essence of
moral evil.â€™ itâ€™s an awful consideration, certainly.â€

â€œi think you slaveholders have an awful responsibility upon you,â€ said
miss ophelia. â€œi wouldnâ€™t have it, fo

i have talked till i was tired and hoarse, telling them their duty, and
all that; and iâ€™m sure they can go to church when they like, though they
donâ€™t understand a word of the sermon, more than so many pigs,--so it
isnâ€™t of any great use for them to go, as i see; but they do go, and so
they have every chance; but, as i said before, they are a degraded race,
and always will be, and there isnâ€™t any help for them; you canâ€™t make
anything of them, if you try. you see, cousin ophelia, iâ€™ve tried, and
you havenâ€™t; i was born and bred among them, and i know.â€

miss ophelia thought she had said enough, and therefore sat silent. st.
clare whistled a tune.

â€œst. clare, i wish you wouldnâ€™t whistle,â€ said marie; â€œit makes my head
worse.â€

â€œi wonâ€™t,â€ said st. clare. â€œis there anything else you wouldnâ€™t wish me
to do?â€

â€œi wish you _would_ have some kind of sympathy for my trials; you never
have any feeling for me.â€

â€œmy dear accusing angel!â€ said

 st. clare.

â€œitâ€™s provoking to be talked to in that way.â€

â€œthen, how will you be talked to? iâ€™ll talk to order,--any way youâ€™ll
mention,--only to give satisfaction.â€

a gay laugh from the court rang through the silken curtains of the
verandah. st. clare stepped out, and lifting up the curtain, laughed
too.

â€œwhat is it?â€ said miss ophelia, coming to the railing.

there sat tom, on a little mossy seat in the court, every one of his
button-holes stuck full of cape jessamines, and eva, gayly laughing, was
hanging a wreath of roses round his neck; and then she sat down on his
knee, like a chip-sparrow, still laughing.

â€œo, tom, you look so funny!â€

tom had a sober, benevolent smile, and seemed, in his quiet way, to be
enjoying the fun quite as much as his little mistress. he lifted his
eyes, when he saw his master, with a half-d

â€œyou would think no harm in a childâ€™s caressing a large dog, even if he

often noticed, in my travels north, how much stronger this was with you
than with us. you loathe them as you would a snake or a toad, yet you

them to africa, out of your sight and smell, and then send a missionary
or two to do up all the self-denial of elevating them compendiously.
isnâ€™t that it?â€

â€œwell, cousin,â€ said miss ophelia, thoughtfully, â€œthere may be some
truth in this.â€

â€œwhat would the poor and lowly do, without children?â€ said st. clare,
leaning on the railing, and watching eva, as she tripped off, leading
tom with her. â€œyour little child is your only true democrat. tom, now

methodist hymns are better than an opera, and the traps and little bits

were a _professor_, to hear you talk.â€

â€œa professor?â€ said st. clare.

â€œyes; a professor of religion.â€

â€œnot at all; not a professor, as your town-folks have it; and, what is
worse, iâ€™m afraid, not a _practiser_, either.â€

â€œwhat makes you talk so, then?â€

â€œnothing is easier than talking,â€ said st. clare. â€œi believe shakespeare

st likely it was. or, if it wasnâ€™t that, it was
something else; for marie patronized good things, and she was going now,
in full force,--diamonds, silk, and lace, and jewels, and all,--to a
fashionable church, to be very religious. marie always made a point to
be very pious on sundays. there she stood, so slender, so elegant, so
airy and undulating in all her motions, her lace scarf enveloping her
like a mist. she looked a graceful creature, and she felt very good and
very elegant indeed. miss ophelia stood at her side, a perfect contrast.
it was not that she had not as handsome a silk dress and shawl, and
as fine a pocket-handkerchief; but stiffness and squareness, and
bolt-uprightness, enveloped her with as indefinite yet appreciable
a presence as did grace her elegant neighbor; not the grace of god,
however,--that is quite another thing!

â€œwhereâ€™s eva?â€ said marie.

â€œthe child stopped on the stairs, to say something to mammy.â€

and what was eva saying to mammy on the stairs? lis

eva looked downcast and aggrieved, and turned slowly.

â€œi say, marie, let the child alone; she shall do as she pleases,â€ said
st. clare.

â€œst. clare, how will she ever get along in the world?â€ said marie.

â€œthe lord knows,â€ said st. clare, â€œbut sheâ€™ll get along in heaven better
than you or i.â€

â€œo, papa, donâ€™t,â€ said eva, softly touching his elbow; â€œit troubles
mother.â€

â€œwell, cousin, are you ready to go to meeting?â€ said miss ophelia,
turning square about on st. clare.

â€œiâ€™m not going, thank you.â€

â€œi do wish st. clare ever would go to church,â€ said marie; â€œbut he
hasnâ€™t a particle of religion about him. it really isnâ€™t respectable.â€

â€œi know it,â€ said st. clare. â€œyou ladies go to church to learn how to
get along in the world, i suppose, and your piety sheds respectability
on us. if i did go at all, i would go where mammy goes; thereâ€™s
something to keep a fellow awake there, at least.â€

â€œwhat!

would our relations, or people in our own class of life. now, if mammy
was sick, you wouldnâ€™t want to put her in your own bed.â€

â€œi should feel just like it, mamma,â€ said eva, â€œbecause then it would
be handier to take care of her, and because, you know, my bed is better
than hers.â€

marie was in utter despair at the entire want of moral perception
evinced in this reply.

â€œwhat can i do to make this child understand me?â€ she said.

â€œnothing,â€ said miss ophelia, significantly.

eva looked sorry and disconcerted for a moment; but children, luckily,
do not keep to one impression long, and in a few moments she was merrily
laughing at various things which she saw from the coach-windows, as it
rattled along.

â€œwell, ladies,â€ said st. clare, as they were comfortably seated at the
dinner-table, â€œand what was the bill of fare at church today?â€

good as that from the picayune, any time, and smoke a cigar besides;
which i canâ€™t do, you know, in a church.â€

â€œwhy,â€ said miss ophelia, â€œdonâ€™t you believe in these views?â€

â€œwho,--i? you know iâ€™m such a graceless dog that these religious aspects
of such subjects donâ€™t edify me much. if i was to say anything on this
slavery matter, i would say out, fair and square, â€˜weâ€™re in for it;
weâ€™ve got â€˜em, and mean to keep â€˜em,--itâ€™s for our convenience and our
interest;â€™ for thatâ€™s the long and short of it,--thatâ€™s just the whole

â€œshocking! itâ€™s the truth. this religious talk on such matters,--why
donâ€™t they carry it a little further, and show the beauty, in its
season, of a fellowâ€™s taking a glass too much, and sitting a little too
late over his cards, and various providential arrangements of that sort,
which are pretty frequent among us young men;--weâ€™d like to hear that
those are right and godly, too.â€

â€œwell,â€ said miss ophelia, â€œdo you think slavery right or wrong?â€

â€œiâ€™m not going to have any of your horrid new england directness,
cousin,â€ said st. clare, gayly. â€œif i answer that question, i know
youâ€™ll be at me with half a dozen others, each one harder than the last;
and iâ€™m not a going to define my position. i am one of the sort that

before.â€

â€œif he did, he wasnâ€™t very polite; for he gave the lord his opinion

the freemanâ€™s defence


there was a gentle bustle at the quaker house, as the afternoon drew to
a close. rachel halliday moved quietly to and fro, collecting from her
household stores such needments as could be arranged in the smallest
compass, for the wanderers who were to go forth that night. the
afternoon shadows stretched eastward, and the round red sun stood

where the weary travellers were received to an abundant breakfast. tom
loker was soon carefully deposited in a much cleaner and softer bed than
he had ever been in the habit of occupying. his wound was carefully
dressed and bandaged, and he lay languidly opening and shutting his
eyes on the white window-curtains and gently-gliding figures of his sick
room, like a weary child. and here, for the present, we shall take our
leave of one party.



chapter xviii

miss opheliaâ€™s experiences and opinions


our friend tom, in his own simple musings, often compared his more
fortunate lot, in the bondage into which he was cast, with that of
joseph in egypt; and, in fact, as time went on, and he developed more
and more under the eye of his master, the strength of the parallel
increased.

st. clare was indolent and careless of money. hitherto the providing and
marketing had been principally done by adolph, who was, to the full, as
careless and extravagant as his master; 
 
 ___________________________
 
€™m not so wonderfully good, now,â€ he said, as he gently
pushed tom to the door. â€œthere, iâ€™ll pledge my honor to you, tom, you
donâ€™t see me so again,â€ he said; and tom went off, wiping his eyes, with
great satisfaction.

â€œiâ€™ll keep my faith with him, too,â€ said st. clare, as he closed the
door.

and st. clare did so,--for gross sensualism, in any form, was not the
peculiar temptation of his nature.

but, all this time, who shall detail the tribulations manifold of our
friend miss ophelia, who had begun the labors of a southern housekeeper?

there is all the difference in the world in the servants of southern
establishments, according to the character and capacity of the
mistresses who have brought them up.

south as well as north, there are women who have an extraordinary talent
for command, and tact in educating. such are enabled, with apparent
ease, and without severity, to subject to their will, and bring into
harmonious and systematic order, the various members of their sma

 are not common
at the south, it is because they are not common in the world. they are
to be found there as often as anywhere; and, when existing, find in
that peculiar state of society a brilliant opportunity to exhibit their
domestic talent.

such a housekeeper marie st. clare was not, nor her mother before her.
indolent and childish, unsystematic and improvident, it was not to be
expected that servants trained under her care should not be so likewise;
and she had very justly described to miss ophelia the state of confusion
she would find in the family, though she had not ascribed it to the
proper cause.

the first morning of her regency, miss ophelia was up at four oâ€™clock;
and having attended to all the adjustments of her own chamber, as
she had done ever since she came there, to the great amazement of the
chambermaid, she prepared for a vigorous onslaught on the cupboards and
closets of the establishment of which she had the keys.

the store-room, the linen-presses, the china-closet, th

preparatory
arrangements,--dinah every once in a while interrupting her meditations
to give a poke, or a rap on the head, to some of the young operators,
with the pudding-stick that lay by her side. in fact, dinah ruled over
the woolly heads of the younger members with a rod of iron, and seemed
to consider them born for no earthly purpose but to â€œsave her steps,â€
 as she phrased it. it was the spirit of the system under which she had
grown up, and she carried it out to its full extent.

miss ophelia, after passing on her reformatory tour through all the
other parts of the establishment, now entered the kitchen. dinah had
heard, from various sources, what was going on, and resolved to stand
on defensive and conservative ground,--mentally determined to oppose and
ignore every new measure, without any actual observable contest.

the kitchen was a large brick-floored apartment, with a great
old-fashioned fireplace stretching along one side of it,--an arrangement
which st. clare had vainly trie
 
 ___________________________
 
 an array of cupboards, drawers, and various
apparatus, to induce systematic regulation, under the sanguine
illusion that it would be of any possible assistance to dinah in her
arrangements. he might as well have provided them for a squirrel or a
magpie. the more drawers and closets there were, the more hiding-holes
could dinah make for the accommodation of old rags, hair-combs, old
shoes, ribbons, cast-off artificial flowers, and other articles of
_vertu_, wherein her soul delighted.

when miss ophelia entered the kitchen dinah did not rise, but smoked on
in sublime tranquillity, regarding her movements obliquely out of the
corner of her eye, but apparently intent only on the operations around
her.

miss ophelia commenced opening a set of drawers.

â€œwhat is this drawer for, dinah?â€ she said.

â€œitâ€™s handy for most anything, missis,â€ said dinah. so it appeared to
be. from the variety it contained, miss ophelia pulled out first a fine
damask table-cloth stained with blood, having evide

ntly been used to
envelop some raw meat.

â€œwhatâ€™s this, dinah? you donâ€™t wrap up meat in your mistressâ€™ best
table-cloths?â€

â€œo lor, missis, no; the towels was all a missinâ€™--so i jest did it. i
laid out to wash that a,--thatâ€™s why i put it thar.â€

â€œshifâ€™less!â€ said miss ophelia to herself, proceeding to tumble over
the drawer, where she found a nutmeg-grater and two or three nutmegs, a
methodist hymn-book, a couple of soiled madras handkerchiefs, some yarn
and knitting-work, a paper of tobacco and a pipe, a few crackers, one or
two gilded china-saucers with some pomade in them, one or two thin old
shoes, a piece of flannel carefully pinned up enclosing some small white
onions, several damask table-napkins, some coarse crash towels, some
twine and darning-needles, and 
 
 ___________________________
 
several broken papers, from which sundry
sweet herbs were sifting into the drawer.

â€œwhere do you keep your nutmegs, dinah?â€ said miss ophelia, with the air
of one who prayed for patience.

â€œmost anywhar, missis; thereâ€™s some in that cracked tea-cup, up there,
and thereâ€™s some over in that ar cupboard.â€

â€œhere are some in the grater,â€ said miss ophelia, holding them up.

â€œlaws, yes, i put â€˜em there this morning,--i likes to keep my things
handy,â€ said dinah. â€œyou, jake! what are you stopping for! youâ€™ll
cotch it! be still, thar!â€ she added, with a dive of her stick at the
criminal.

â€œwhatâ€™s this?â€ said miss ophelia, holding up the saucer of pomade.

â€œlaws, itâ€™s my har _grease_;--i put it thar to have it handy.â€

â€œdo you use your mistressâ€™ best saucers for that?â€

â€œlaw! it was cause i was driv, and in sich a hur

â€œwell, here are these onions.â€

miss ophelia lifted out the sifting papers of sweet herbs.

â€œi wish missis wouldnâ€™t touch dem ar. i likes to keep my things where i

â€œbut you donâ€™t want these holes in the papers.â€

â€œbut you see it spills all over the drawer.â€

â€œlor, now! miss phelia; dat ar anâ€™t no way for ladies to do. i never did
see ladies doinâ€™ no sich; my old missis nor miss marie never did, and
i donâ€™t see no kinder need on â€˜t;â€ and dinah stalked indignantly about,
while miss ophelia piled and sorted dishes, emptied dozens of scattering
bowls of sugar into one receptacle, sorted napkins, table-cloths, and
towels, for washing; washing, wiping, and arranging with her own hands,
and with a speed and alacrity which perfectly amazed dinah.

â€œlor now! if dat ar de way dem northern ladies do, dey anâ€™t ladies,

distance. â€œi has things as straight as anybody, when my clarinâ€™ up times

herself up in a smart dress, clean apron, and high, brilliant madras
turban, and tell all marauding â€œyoung unsâ€ to keep out of the kitchen,
for she was gwine to have things kept nice. indeed, these periodic
seasons were often an inconvenience to the whole household; for dinah
would contract such an immoderate attachment to her scoured tin, as
to insist upon it that it shouldnâ€™t be used again for any possible
purpose,--at least, till the ardor of the â€œclarinâ€™ upâ€ period abated.

miss ophelia, in a few days, thoroughly reformed every department of the
house to a systematic pattern; but her labors in all departments that
depended on the cooperation of servants were like those of sisyphus or
the danaides. in despair, she one day appealed to st. clare.

â€œthere is no such thing as getting anything like a system in this
family!â€

â€œto be sure, there isnâ€™t,â€ said st. clare.

â€œsuch shiftless management, such waste, such confusion, i never saw!â€

â€œi dare say you didnâ€™t.â€

are judged, _by her success_.â€

â€œbut the waste,--the expense!â€

â€œo, well! lock everything you can, and keep the key. give out by
driblets, and never inquire for odds and ends,--it isnâ€™t best.â€

â€œthat troubles me, augustine. i canâ€™t help feeling as if these servants
were not _strictly honest_. are you sure they can be relied on?â€

augustine laughed immoderately at the grave and anxious face with which
miss ophelia propounded the question.

â€œo, cousin, thatâ€™s too good,--_honest!_--as if thatâ€™s a thing to be
expected! honest!--why, of course, they arnâ€™t. why should they be? what
upon earth is to make them so?â€

â€œwhy donâ€™t you instruct?â€

â€œinstruct! o, fiddlestick! what instructing do you think i should do?
i look like it! as to marie, she has spirit enough, to be sure, to kill
off a whole plantation, if iâ€™d let her manage; but she wouldnâ€™t get the
cheatery out of them.â€

be punished for it. as to honesty, the slave is kept in that dependent,
semi-childish state, that there is no making him realize the rights of
property, or feel that his masterâ€™s goods are not his own, if he can get
them. for my part, i donâ€™t see how they _can_ be honest. such a fellow
as tom, here, is,--is a moral miracle!â€

â€œand what becomes of their souls?â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œthat isnâ€™t my affair, as i know of,â€ said st. clare; â€œi am only dealing
in facts of the present life. the fact is, that the whole race are
pretty generally understood to be turned over to the devil, for our
benefit, in this world, however it may turn out in another!â€

â€œthis is perfectly horrible!â€ said miss ophelia; â€œyou ought to be ashamed
of yourselves!â€

â€œi donâ€™t know as i am. we are in pretty good company, for all that,â€
 said st. clare, â€œas people in the broad

it is so in england; it is so everywhere; and yet all christendom stands
aghast, with virtuous indignation, because we do the thing in a little
different shape from what they do it.â€

â€œit isnâ€™t so in vermont.â€

â€œah, well, in new england, and in the free states, you have the better
of us, i grant. but thereâ€™s the bell; so, cousin, let us for a while lay
aside our sectional prejudices, and come out to dinner.â€

as miss ophelia was in the kitchen in the latter part of the afternoon,
some of the sable children called out, â€œla, sakes! tharâ€™s prue a coming,
grunting along like she allers does.â€

a tall, bony colored woman now entered the kitchen, bearing on her head
a basket of rusks and hot rolls.

â€œho, prue! youâ€™ve come,â€ said dinah.

prue had a peculiar scowling expression of countenance, and a sullen,
grumbling voice. she set down her basket, squatted herself down, and
resting her elbows on her knees said

â€œwhy do you wish you were dead?â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œiâ€™d be out oâ€™ my misery,â€ said the woman, gruffly, without taking her
eyes from the floor.

â€œwhat need you getting drunk, then, and cutting up, prue?â€ said a spruce
quadroon chambermaid, dangling, as she spoke, a pair of coral ear-drops.

the woman looked at her with a sour surly glance.

â€œmaybe youâ€™ll come to it, one of these yer days. iâ€™d be glad to see you,
i would; then youâ€™ll be glad of a drop, like me, to forget your misery.â€

dinah. â€œyou, jake, climb up and get it down.â€

â€œtickets,--what are they for?â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œwe buy tickets of her masâ€™r, and she gives us bread for â€˜em.â€

â€œand they counts my money and tickets, when i gets home, to see if i â€˜s
got the change; and if i hanâ€™t, they half kills me.â€

â€œand serves you right,â€ said jane, the pert chambermaid, â€œif you will
take their money to get drunk on. thatâ€™s what she does, missis.â€

â€œand thatâ€™s what i _will_ do,--i canâ€™t live no other ways,--drink and
forget my misery.â€

â€œyou are very wicked and very foolish,â€ sai

â€œitâ€™s mighty likely, missis; but i will do it,--yes, i will. o lord!
i wish i â€˜s dead, i do,--i wish i â€˜s dead, and out of my misery!â€ and
slowly and stiffly the old creature rose, and got her basket on her head
again; but before she went out, she looked at the quadroon girl, who
still stood playing with her ear-drops.

â€œye think yeâ€™re mighty fine with them ar, a frolickinâ€™ and a tossinâ€™

her long, silky curls.

â€œwell, in the lordâ€™s sight, anâ€™t wool as good as har, any time?â€ said
dinah. â€œiâ€™d like to have missis say which is worth the most,--a couple
such as you, or one like me. get out wid ye, ye trumpery,--i wonâ€™t have
ye round!â€

here the conversation was interrupted in a two-fold manner. st. clareâ€™s
voice was heard at the head of the stairs, asking adolph if he meant to
stay all night with his shaving-water; and miss ophelia, coming out of
the dining-room, said,

â€œjane and rosa, what are you wasting your time for, here? go in and
attend to your muslins.â€

our friend tom, who had been in the kitchen during the conversation with
the old rusk-woman, had followed her out into the street. he saw her go
on, giving every once in a while a suppressed groan. at last she set
her basket down on a doorstep, and began arranging the old, faded shawl
which covered her shoulders.

â€œiâ€™ll carry your basket a piece,â€ said t

â€œi feel bad, miss eva,â€ said tom, sorrowfully. â€œbut iâ€™ll get the horses
for you.â€

â€œbut do tell me, tom, what is the matter. i saw you talking to cross old
prue.â€

tom, in simple, earnest phrase, told eva the womanâ€™s history. she did
not exclaim or wonder, or weep, as other children do. her cheeks grew
pale, and a deep, earnest shadow passed over her eyes. she laid both
hands on her bosom, and sighed heavily.

chapter xix

miss opheliaâ€™s experiences and opinions continued


â€œtom, you neednâ€™t get me the horses. i donâ€™t want to go,â€ she said.

â€œwhy not, miss eva?â€

â€œthese things sink into my heart, tom,â€ said eva,--â€œthey sink into my
heart,â€ she repeated, earnestly. â€œi donâ€™t want to go;â€ and she turned
from tom, and went into the house.

a few days after, another woman came, in old prueâ€™s place, to bring the
rusks; miss ophelia was in the kitchen.

â€œlor!â€ said dinah, â€œwhatâ€™s got prue?â€

â

€œprue isnâ€™t coming any more,â€ said the woman, mysteriously.

â€œwhy not?â€ said dinah, â€œshe anâ€™t dead, is she?â€

â€œwe doesnâ€™t exactly know. sheâ€™s down cellar,â€ said the woman, glancing
at miss ophelia.

after miss ophelia had taken the rusks, dinah followed the woman to the
door.

â€œwhat _has_ got prue, any how?â€ she said.

the woman seemed desirous, yet reluctant, to speak, and answered, in
low, mysterious tone.

â€œwell, you mustnâ€™t tell nobody, prue, she got drunk agin,--and they
had her down cellar,--and thar they left her all day,--and i hearn â€˜em
saying that the _flies had got to her_,--and _sheâ€™s dead_!â€

dinah held up her hands, and, turning, saw close by her side the
spirit-like form of evang

heeks.

â€œlor bless us! miss evaâ€™s gwine to faint away! what go us all, to let
her har such talk? her paâ€™ll be rail mad.â€

â€œi shanâ€™t faint, dinah,â€ said the child, firmly; â€œand why shouldnâ€™t i
hear it? it anâ€™t so much for me to hear it, as for poor prue to suffer
it.â€

â€œ_lor sakes_! it isnâ€™t for sweet, delicate young ladies, like
you,--these yer stories isnâ€™t; itâ€™s enough to kill â€˜em!â€

eva sighed again, and walked up stairs with a slow and melancholy step.

miss ophelia anxiously inquired the womanâ€™s story. dinah gave a very
garrulous version of it, to which tom added the particulars which he had
drawn from her that morning.

â€œan abominable business,--perfectly horrible!â€ she exclaimed, as she
entered the room where st. clare lay reading his paper.

â€œpray, what iniquity has turned up now?â€ said he.

â€œwhat now? why, those folks have whipped prue to death!â€ said miss
ophelia, going on, with great strength of detail, into the story, and
enlarging on

areâ€™s fine countenance was for a moment overcast; he said,

â€œcome, cousin, donâ€™t stand there looking like one of the fates; youâ€™ve
only seen a peep through the curtain,--a specimen of what is going
on, the world over, in some shape or other. if we are to be prying
and spying into all the dismals of life, we should have no heart to
anything. â€˜t is like looking too close into the details of dinahâ€™s
kitchen;â€ and st. clare lay back on the sofa, and busied himself with
his paper.

miss ophelia sat down, and pulled out her knitting-work, and sat there
grim with indignation. she knit and knit, but while she mused the fire
burned; at last she broke out--â€œi tell you, augustine, i canâ€™t get over
things so, if you can. itâ€™s a perfect abomination for you to defend such
a system,--thatâ€™s _my_ mind!â€

â€œwhat now?â€ said st. clare, looking up. â€œat it again, hey?â€

â€œi say itâ€™s perfectly abominable for you to defend such a system!â€ said
miss ophelia, with increasing warmth.

â€œ_i_ defend it, my dear lady? who ever said i did defend it?â€ said st.
clare.

â€œof course, you defend it,--you all do,--all you southerners. what do
you have slaves for, if you donâ€™t?â€

â€œare you such a sweet innocent as to suppose nobody in this world ever
does what they donâ€™t think is right? donâ€™t you, or didnâ€™t you ever, do
anything that you did not think quite right?â€

â€œif i do, i repent of it, i hope,â€ said miss ophelia, rattling her
needles with energy.

â€œso do i,â€ said st. clare, peeling his orange; â€œiâ€™m repenting of it all
the time.â€

â€œwhat do you keep on doing it for?â€

â€œdidnâ€™t you ever keep on doing wrong, after youâ€™d repented, my good
cousin?â€

â€œwell, only when iâ€™ve been very much tempted,â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œwell, iâ€™m very much tempted,â€ said st. clare; â€œthatâ€™s just my
difficulty.â€

â€œbut i always resolve i wonâ€™t and i try to break off.â€

â€œwell, i have be

en resolving i wonâ€™t, off and on, these ten years,â€ said
st. clare; â€œbut i havenâ€™t, some how, got clear. have you got clear of
all your sins, cousin?â€

â€œcousin augustine,â€ said miss ophelia, seriously, and laying down
her knitting-work, â€œi suppose i deserve that you should reprove my
short-comings. i know all you say is true enough; nobody else feels
them more than i do; but it does seem to me, after all, there is some
difference between me and you. it seems to me i would cut off my right
hand sooner than keep on, from day to day, doing what i thought was
wrong. but, then, my conduct is so inconsistent with my profession, i
donâ€™t wonder you reprove me.â€

â€œo, now, cousin,â€
 
 ___________________________
 
 said augustine, sitting down on the floor, and laying
his head back in her lap, â€œdonâ€™t take on so awfully serious! you know
what a good-for-nothing, saucy boy i always was. i love to poke you
up,--thatâ€™s all,--just to see you get earnest. i do think you are
desperately, distressingly good; it tires me to death to think of it.â€

â€œbut this is a serious subject, my boy, auguste,â€ said miss ophelia,
laying her hand on his forehead.

â€œdismally so,â€ said he; â€œand i--well, i never want to talk seriously in
hot weather. what with mosquitos and all, a fellow canâ€™t get himself
up to any very sublime moral flights; and i believe,â€ said st. clare,
suddenly rousing himself up, â€œthereâ€™s a theory, now! i understand now
why northern nations are always more virtuous than southern ones,--i see
into that whole subject.â€

â€œo, augustine, you are a sad rattle-brain!â€

â€œam i? well, so

l be serious, now;
but you must hand me that basket of oranges;--you see, youâ€™ll have to
â€˜stay me with flagons and comfort me with apples,â€™ if iâ€™m going to make
this effort. now,â€ said augustine, drawing the basket up, â€œiâ€™ll begin:
when, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for a fellow
to hold two or three dozen of his fellow-worms in captivity, a decent
regard to the opinions of society requires--â€

â€œi donâ€™t see that you are growing more serious,â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œwait,--iâ€™m coming on,--youâ€™ll hear. the short of the matter is,
cousin,â€ said he, his handsome face suddenly settling into an earnest
and serious expression, â€œon this abstract question of slavery there
can, as i think, be but one opinion. planters, who have money to make by
it,--clergymen, who have planters to please,--politicians, who want
to rule by it,--may warp and bend language and ethics to a degree that
shall astonish the world at their ingenuity; they can press nature and

neither they nor the world believe in it one particle the more. it comes
from the devil, thatâ€™s the short of it;--and, to my mind, itâ€™s a pretty
respectable specimen of what he can do in his own line.â€

miss ophelia stopped her knitting, and looked surprised, and st. clare,
apparently enjoying her astonishment, went on.

â€œyou seem to wonder; but if you will get me fairly at it, iâ€™ll make a
clean breast of it. this cursed business, accursed of god and man, what
is it? strip it of all its ornament, run it down to the root and nucleus
of the whole, and what is it? why, because my brother quashy is ignorant
and weak, and i am intelligent and strong,--because i know how, and
_can_ do it,--therefore, i may s

-we would _scorn_ to use the full power which our
savage laws put into our hands. and he who goes the furthest, and does
the worst, only uses within limits the power that the law gives him.â€

st. clare had started up, and, as his manner was when excited, was
walking, with hurried steps, up and down the floor. his fine face,
classic as that of a greek statue, seemed actually to burn with the
fervor of his feelings. his large blue eyes flashed, and he gestured
with an unconscious eagerness. miss ophelia had never seen him in this
mood before, and she sat perfectly silent.

â€œi declare to you,â€ said he, suddenly stopping before his cousin â€œ(itâ€™s
no sort of use to talk or to feel on this subject), but i declare to
you, there have been times when i have thought, if the whole country
would sink, and hide all this injustice and misery from the light, i
would willingly sink with it. when i have been travelling up and down
on our boats, or about on my collecting tours, and reflected that every
 
 ___________________________
 

brutal, disgusting, mean, low-lived fellow i met, was allowed by our
laws to become absolute despot of as many men, women and children, as
he could cheat, steal, or gamble money enough to buy,--when i have seen
such men in actual ownership of helpless children, of young girls and
women,--i have been ready to curse my country, to curse the human race!â€

â€œaugustine! augustine!â€ said miss ophelia, â€œiâ€™m sure youâ€™ve said enough.
i never, in my life, heard anything like this, even at the north.â€

â€œat the north!â€ said st. clare, with a sudden change of expression, and
resuming something of his habitual careless tone. â€œpooh! your northern
folks are cold-blooded; you are cool in everything! you canâ€™t begin to
curse up hill and down as we can, when we get fairly at it.â€

â€œwell, but the question is,â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œo, yes, to be sure, the _question is_,--and a deuc

constitution and habit, a duplicate of my father. i can see it leaking
out in fifty different ways,--just the same strong, overbearing,
dominant spirit. you know very well how impossible it is to persuade
some of the folks in your village that squire sinclair does not feel
above them. the fact is, though he has fallen on democratic times, and
embraced a democratic theory, he is to the heart an aristocrat, as much
as my father, who ruled over five or six hundred slaves.â€

miss ophelia felt rather disposed to cavil at this picture, and was
laying down her knitting to begin, but st. clare stopped her.

â€œnow, i know every word you are going to say. i do not say they _were_
alike, in fact. one fell into a condition where everything acted against
the natural tendency, and the other where everything acted for it; and
so one turned out a pretty wilful, stout, overbearing old democrat, and
the other a wilful, stout old despot. if both had owned plantations in
louisiana, they would

 have been as like as two old bullets cast in the
same mould.â€

â€œwhat an undutiful boy you are!â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œi donâ€™t mean them any disrespect,â€ said st. clare. â€œyou know reverence
is not my forte. but, to go back to my history:

â€œwhen father died, he left the whole property to us twin boys, to be
divided as we should agree. there does not breathe on godâ€™s earth a
nobler-souled, more generous fellow, than alfred, in all that concerns
his equals; and we got on admirably with this property question,
without a single unbrotherly word or feeling. we undertook to work the
plantation together;

constant eye of a
master, without the power of putting forth one irresponsible volition,
on the same dreary, monotonous, unchanging toil, and all for two pairs
of pantaloons and a pair of shoes a year, with enough food and shelter
to keep him in working order! any man who thinks that human beings can,
as a general thing, be made about as comfortable that way as any other,
i wish he might try it. iâ€™d buy the dog, and work him, with a clear
conscience!â€

â€œi always have supposed,â€ said miss ophelia, â€œthat you, all of you,
approved of these things, and thought them _right_--according to
scripture.â€

â€œhumbug! we are not quite reduced to that yet. alfred who is as
determined a despot as ever walked, does not pretend to this kind of
defence;--no, he stands, high and haughty, on that good old respectable
ground, _the right of the strongest_; and he says, and i think quite
sensibly, that the american planter is â€˜only doing, in another form,
what the english aristocracy and capitalists a

without enslavement of the masses, either nominal or real. there must,
he says, be a lower class, given up to physical toil and confined to an
animal nature; and a higher one thereby acquires leisure and wealth for
a more expanded intelligence and improvement, and becomes the directing
soul of the lower. so he reasons, because, as i said, he is born an
aristocrat;--so i donâ€™t believe, because i was born a democrat.â€

â€œhow in the world can the two things be compared?â€ said miss ophelia.
â€œthe english laborer is not sold, traded, parted from his family,
whipped.â€

â€œhe is as much at the will of his employer as if he were sold to him.
the slave-owner can whip his refractory slave to death,--the capitalist
can starve him to death. as to family security, it is hard to say which
is the worst,--to have oneâ€™s children sold, or see them starve to death
at home.â€

â€œbut itâ€™s no kind of apology for slavery, to prove that it isnâ€™t worse
than some other bad thing.â€

,--looking at his teeth, cracking his joints, and
trying his paces and then paying down for him,--having speculators,
breeders, traders, and brokers in human bodies and souls,--sets the
thing before the eyes of the civilized world in a more tangible form,
though the thing done be, after all, in its nature, the same; that is,
appropriating one set of human beings to the use and improvement of
another without any regard to their own.â€

â€œi never thought of the matter in this light,â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œwell, iâ€™ve travelled in england some, and iâ€™ve looked over a good many
documents as to the state of their lower classes; and i really think
there is no denying alfred, when he says that his slaves are better off
than a large class of the population of england. you see, you must not
infer, from what i have told you, that alfred is what is called a hard
master; for he isnâ€™t. he is despotic, and unmerciful to insubordination;
he would shoot a fellow down with as little remorse as he wou

ad influence from the hour of birth, spending the whole of every
week-day in unreflecting toil, cannot be done much with by a few hours
on sunday. the teachers of sunday-schools among the manufacturing
population of england, and among plantation-hands in our country, could
perhaps testify to the same result, _there and here_. yet some striking
exceptions there are among us, from the fact that the negro is naturally
more impressible to religious sentiment than the white.â€

â€œwell,â€ said miss ophelia, â€œhow came you to give up your plantation
life?â€

â€œwell, we jogged on together some time, till alfred saw plainly that
i was no planter. he thought it absurd, after he had reformed, and
altered, and improved everywhere, to suit my notions, that i still
remained unsatisfied. the fact was, it was, after all, the thing that
i hated--the using these men and women, the perpetuation of all this
ignorance, brutality and vice,--just to make money for me!

â€œbesides, i was always interfering in t

satisfied to be as they were.â€ he paused, and walked reflectively up and
down the room.

â€œthere was,â€ said st. clare, â€œa time in my life when i had plans and
hopes of doing something in this world, more than to float and drift. i
had vague, indistinct yearnings to be a sort of emancipator,--to free
my native land from this spot and stain. all young men have had such
fever-fits, i suppose, some time,--but then--â€

â€œwhy didnâ€™t you?â€ said miss ophelia;--â€œyou ought not to put your hand to
the plough, and look back.â€

â€œo, well, things didnâ€™t go with me as i expected, and i got the despair
of living that solomon did. i suppose it was a necessary incident to
wisdom in us both; but, some how or other, instead of being actor and
regenerator in society, i became a piece of driftwood, and have been
floating and eddying about, ever since. alfred scolds me, every time
we meet; and he has the better of me, i grant,--for he really does

run among them, and think our children would not take it, as to let them
be uninstructed and vicious, and think our children will not be affected
by that. yet our laws positively and utterly forbid any efficient
general educational system, and they do it wisely, too; for, just begin
and thoroughly educate one generation, and the whole thing would be
blown sky high. if we did not give them liberty, they would take it.â€

â€œand what do you think will be the end of this?â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œi donâ€™t know. one thing is certain,--that there is a mustering among
the masses, the world over; and there is a _dies irÃ¦_ coming on, sooner
or later. the same thing is working in europe, in england, and in this
country. my mother used to tell me of a millennium that was coming,
when christ should reign, and all men should be free and happy. and she
taught me, when i was a boy, to pray, â€˜thy kingdom come.â€™ sometimes i
think all this sighing, and groaning, and stirring among the dry

of his appearing?â€

â€œaugustine, sometimes i think you are not far from the kingdom,â€ said
miss ophelia, laying down her knitting, and looking anxiously at her
cousin.

â€œthank you for your good opinion, but itâ€™s up and down with me,--up to
heavenâ€™s gate in theory, down in earthâ€™s dust in practice. but thereâ€™s
the teabell,--do letâ€™s go,--and donâ€™t say, now, i havenâ€™t had one
downright serious talk, for once in my life.â€

at table, marie alluded to the incident of prue. â€œi suppose youâ€™ll
think, cousin,â€ she said, â€œthat we are all barbarians.â€

â€œi think thatâ€™s a barba

think you are all barbarians.â€

â€œwell, now,â€ said marie, â€œi know itâ€™s impossible to get along with some
of these creatures. they are so bad they ought not to live. i donâ€™t feel
a particle of sympathy for such cases. if theyâ€™d only behave themselves,
it would not happen.â€

â€œbut, mamma,â€ said eva, â€œthe poor creature was unhappy; thatâ€™s what made
her drink.â€

â€œo, fiddlestick! as if that were any excuse! iâ€™m unhappy, very often. i

to me. well, i took him in hand, and in one fortnight i had him tamed
down as submissive and tractable as heart could desire.â€

â€œwhat in the world did you do to him?â€ said marie.

â€œwell, it was quite a simple process. i took him to my own room, had a
good bed made for him, dressed his wounds, and tended him myself, until
he got fairly on his feet again. and, in process of time, i had free
papers made out for him, and told him he might go where he liked.â€

â€œand did he go?â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œno. the foolish fellow tore the paper in two, and absolutely refused
to leave me. i never had a braver, better fellow,--trusty and true as
steel. he embraced christianity afterwards, and became as gentle as a
child. he used to oversee my place on the lake, and did it capitally,
too. i lost him the first cholera season. in fact, he laid down his life
for me. for i was sick, almost to death; and when, through the panic,
everybody else fled, scipio worked for me like a giant, and actually

they told him so.â€

st. clare thought, in his heart, that this was probably only one
of those things which good-natured owners say to their servants,
to alleviate their horror of being sold, without any intention of
fulfilling the expectation thus excited. but he did not make any audible
comment upon it,--only ordered tom to get the horses out for a ride.

tomâ€™s letter was written in due form for him that evening, and safely
lodged in the post-office.

miss ophelia still persevered in her labors in the housekeeping line. it
was universally agreed, among all the household, from dinah down to the
youngest urchin, that miss ophelia was decidedly â€œcuris,â€--a term by
which a southern servant implies that his or her betters donâ€™t exactly
suit them.

the higher circle in the family--to wit, adolph, jane and rosa--agreed
that she was no lady; ladies never keep working about as she did,--that
she had no _air_ at all; and they were surprised that she should b

relation of the st. clares. even marie declared that it was absolutely
fatiguing to see cousin ophelia always so busy. and, in fact, miss
opheliaâ€™s industry was so incessant as to lay some foundation for the
complaint. she sewed and stitched away, from daylight till dark, with
the energy of one who is pressed on by some immediate urgency; and then,
when the light faded, and the work was folded away, with one turn out
came the ever-ready knitting-work, and there she was again, going on as
briskly as ever. it really was a labor to see her.

one morning, while miss ophelia w

as busy in some of her domestic cares,
st. clareâ€™s voice was heard, calling her at the foot of the stairs.

â€œcome down here, cousin, iâ€™ve something to show you.â€

â€œwhat is it?â€ said miss ophelia, coming down, with her sewing in her
hand.

â€œiâ€™ve made a purchase for your department,--see here,â€ said st. clare;
and, with the word, he pulled along a little negro girl, about eight or
nine years of age.

she was one of the blackest of her race; and her round shining eyes,
glittering as glass beads, moved with quick and restless glances over
everything in the room. her mouth, half open with astonishment at the
wonders of the new masâ€™râ€™s parlor, displayed a white and brilliant set
of

time, and producing in her throat all those odd guttural sounds which
distinguish the native music of her race; and finally, turning a
summerset or two, and giving a prolonged closing note, as odd and
unearthly as that of a steam-whistle, she came suddenly down on the
carpet, and stood with her hands folded, and a most sanctimonious
expression of meekness and solemnity over her face, only broken by the
cunning glances which she shot askance from the corners of her eyes.

miss ophelia stood silent, perfectly paralyzed with amazement. st.
clare, like a mischievous fellow as he was, appeared to enjoy her
astonishment; and, addressing the child again, said,

â€œtopsy, this is your new mistress. iâ€™m going to give you up to her; see
now that you behave yourself.â€

â€œyes, masâ€™r,â€ said topsy, with sanctimonious gravity, her wicked eyes
twinkling as she spoke.

â€œyouâ€™re going to be good, topsy, you understand,â€ said st. clare.

â€œo yes, masâ€™r,â€ said topsy, with an

other twinkle, her hands still
devoutly folded.

â€œnow, augustine, what upon earth is this for?â€ said miss ophelia. â€œyour
house is so full of these little plagues, now, that a body canâ€™t set
down their foot without treading on â€˜em. i get up in the morning, and
find one asleep behind the door, and see one black head poking out from
under the table, one lying on the door-mat,--and they are mopping and
mowing and grinning between all the railings, and tumbling over the
kitchen floor! what on earth did you want to bring this one for?â€

â€œfor you to educate--didnâ€™t i tell you? youâ€™re always preachin

ng just such heathen. but let
me see one of you that would take one into your house with you, and take
the labor of their conversion on yourselves! no; when it comes to that,
they are dirty and disagreeable, and itâ€™s too much care, and so on.â€

â€œaugustine, you know i didnâ€™t think of it in that light,â€ said miss
ophelia, evidently softening. â€œwell, it might be a real missionary
work,â€ said she, looking rather more favorably on the child.

st. clare had touched the right string. miss opheliaâ€™s conscientiousness
was ever on the alert. â€œbut,â€ she added, â€œi really didnâ€™t see the need
of buying this one;--there are enough now, in your house, to take all my
time and skill.â€

â€œwell, then, cousin,â€ said st. clare, drawing her aside, â€œi ought to
beg your pardon for my good-for-nothing speeches. you are so good,
after all, that thereâ€™s no sense in them. why, the fact is, this concern

screaming, and them beating and swearing at her. she looked bright and
funny, too, as if something might be made of her;--so i bought her, and
iâ€™ll give her to you. try, now, and give her a good orthodox new england
bringing up, and see what itâ€™ll make of her. you know i havenâ€™t any gift
that way; but iâ€™d like you to try.â€

â€œwell, iâ€™ll do what i can,â€ said miss ophelia; and she approached her
new subject very much as a person might be supposed to approach a black
spider, supposing them to have benevolent designs toward it.

â€œsheâ€™s dreadfully dirty, and half naked,â€ she said.

â€œwell, take her down stairs, and make some of them clean and clothe her
up.â€

miss ophelia carried her to the kitchen regions.

â€œdonâ€™t see what masâ€™r st. clare wants of â€˜nother nigger!â€ said dinah,
surveying the new arrival with no friendly air. â€œwonâ€™t have her ar

â€œpah!â€ said rosa and jane, with supreme disgust; â€œlet her keep out of
our way! what in the world masâ€™r wanted another of these low niggers
for, i canâ€™t see!â€

â€œyou go long! no more nigger dan you be, miss rosa,â€ said dinah,
who felt this last remark a reflection on herself. â€œyou seem to tink
yourself white folks. you anâ€™t nerry one, black _nor_ white, iâ€™d like to
be one or turrer.â€

miss ophelia saw that there was nobody in the camp that would undertake
to oversee the cleansing and dressing of the new arrival; and so she
was forced to do it herself, with some very ungracious and reluctant
assistance from jane.

it is not for ears polite to hear the particulars of the first toilet of
a neglected, abused child. in fact, in this world, multitudes must live
and die in a state that it would be too great a shock to the nerves of
their fellow-mortals even to hear described. miss ophelia had a

â€œdonâ€™t that show sheâ€™s
a limb? weâ€™ll have fine works with her, i reckon. i hate these nigger
young uns! so disgusting! i wonder that masâ€™r would buy her!â€

the â€œyoung unâ€ alluded to heard all these comments with the subdued and
doleful air which seemed habitual to her, only scanning, with a keen and
furtive glance of her flickering eyes, the ornaments which jane wore in
her ears. when arrayed at last in a suit of decent and whole
clothing, her hair cropped short to her head, miss ophelia, with some
satisfaction, said she looked more christian-like than she did, and in
her own mind began to mature some plans for her instruction.

sitting down before her, she began to question her.

â€œhow old are you, topsy?â€

â€œdun no, missis,â€ said the image, with a grin that showed all her teeth.

â€œdonâ€™t know how old you are? didnâ€™t anybody ever tell you? who was your
mother?â€

â€œnever had none!â€ said the child, with another grin.

â€œnever had any mother? what do you mean? wh

ere were you born?â€

â€œnever was born!â€ persisted topsy, with another grin, that looked so
goblin-like, that, if miss ophelia had been at all nervous, she might
have fancied that she had got hold of some sooty gnome from the land
of diablerie; but miss ophelia was not nervous, but plain and
business-like, and she said, with some sternness,

â€œyou mustnâ€™t answer me in that way, child; iâ€™m not playing with you.
tell me where you were born, and who your father and mother were.â€

â€œnever was born,â€ reiterated the creature, more emphatically; â€œnever had
no father nor mother, nor nothinâ€™. i was raised by a speculator, with
lots of others. old aunt sue used to take car on us.â€

the child was evidently sincere, and jane, breaking into a short

anything about time,â€ said jane; â€œthey donâ€™t know what a year is; they
donâ€™t know their own ages.

â€œhave you ever heard anything about god, topsy?â€

the child looked bewildered, but grinned as usual.

â€œdo you know who made you?â€

â€œnobody, as i knows on,â€ said the child, with a short laugh.

the idea appeared to amuse her considerably; for her eyes twinkled, and
she added,

â€œi spect i growâ€™d. donâ€™t think nobody never made me.â€

â€œdo you know how to sew?â€ said miss ophelia, who thought she would turn
her inquiries to something more tangible.

â€œno, missis.â€

â€œwhat can you do?--what did you do for your master and mistress?â€

â€œfetch water, and wash dishes, and rub knives, and wait on folks.â€

â€œwere they good to you?â€

â€œspect they was,â€ said the child, scanning miss ophelia cunningly.

miss ophelia rose from this encouraging colloquy; st. clare was leaning
over the back of her chair.

â€œyou find virgin soil there, cousin; put in your own ideas,--

miss opheliaâ€™s ideas of education, like all her other ideas, were
very set and definite; and of the kind that prevailed in new england
a century ago, and which are still preserved in some very retired and
unsophisticated parts, where there are no railroads. as nearly as could
be expressed, they could be comprised in very few words: to teach them
to mind when they were spoken to; to teach them the catechism, sewing,
and reading; and to whip them if they told lies. and though, of course,
in the flood of lig

ht that is now poured on education, these are left
far away in the rear, yet it is an undisputed fact that our grandmothers
raised some tolerably fair men and women under this regime, as many of
us can remember and testify. at all events, miss ophelia knew of nothing
else to do; and, therefore, applied her mind to her heathen with the
best diligence she could command.

the child was announced and considered in the family as miss opheliaâ€™s
girl; and, as she was looked upon with no gracious eye in the kitchen,
miss ophelia resolved to confine her sphere of operation and instruction
chiefly to her own chamber. with a self-sacrifice which some of our
readers will appreciate, she resolved, instead of comfortably making her
own bed, sweeping and dusting her own chamber,--which she had hitherto
done, in utter scorn of all offers of help from the chambermaid of the
establishment,--to condemn herself to the martyrdom of instructing t

to perform these operations,--ah, woe the day! did any of our readers
ever do the same, they will appreciate the amount of her self-sacrifice.

miss ophelia began with topsy by taking her into her chamber, the first
morning, and solemnly commencing a course of instruction in the art and
mystery of bed-making.

behold, then, topsy, washed and shorn of all the little braided
tails wherein her heart had delighted, arrayed in a clean gown, with
well-starched apron, standing reverently before miss ophelia, with an
expression of solemnity well befitting a funeral.

â€œnow, topsy, iâ€™m going to show you just how my bed is to be made. i am

ays topsy, with a deep sigh, and a face of woful
earnestness.

â€œnow, topsy, look here;--this is the hem of the sheet,--this is the
right side of the sheet, and this is the wrong;--will you remember?â€

â€œyes, maâ€™am,â€ says topsy, with another sigh.

â€œwell, now, the under sheet you must bring over the bolster,--so--and
tuck it clear down under the mattress nice and smooth,--so,--do you
see?â€

â€œyes, maâ€™am,â€ said topsy, with profound attention.

â€œbut the upper sheet,â€ said miss ophelia, â€œmust be brought down in this
way, and tucked under firm and smooth at the foot,--so,--the narrow hem
at the foot.â€

â€œyes, maâ€™am,â€ said topsy, as before;--but we will add, what miss ophelia
did not see, that, during the time when the good ladyâ€™s back was turned
in the zeal of her manipulations, the young disciple had contrived to
snatch a pair of gloves and a ribbon, which she had adroitly slipped
into her sleeves, and stood with her hands dutifully folded, as before.

â€œnow, tops

y, letâ€™s see _you_ do this,â€ said miss ophelia, pulling off
the clothes, and seating herself.

topsy, with great gravity and adroitness, went through the exercise
completely to miss opheliaâ€™s satisfaction; smoothing the sheets, patting
out every wrinkle, and exhibiting, through the whole process, a gravity
and seriousness with which her instructress was greatly edified. by an
unlucky slip, however, a fluttering fragment of the ribbon hung out of
one of her sleeves, just as she was finishing, and caught miss opheliaâ€™s
attention. instantly, she pounced upon it. â€œwhatâ€™s this? you naughty,
wicked child,--youâ€™ve been stealing this!â€

the ribbon was pulled out of topsyâ€™s o

wn sleeve, yet was she not in
the least disconcerted; she only looked at it with an air of the most
surprised and unconscious innocence.

â€œlaws! why, that arâ€™s miss feelyâ€™s ribbon, anâ€™t it? how could it a got
caught in my sleeve?

â€œtopsy, you naughty girl, donâ€™t you tell me a lie,--you stole that
ribbon!â€

â€œmissis, i declar for â€˜t, i didnâ€™t;--never seed it till dis yer blessed
minnit.â€

â€œtopsy,â€ said miss ophelia, â€œdonâ€™t you know itâ€™s wicked to tell lies?â€

â€œi never tell no lies, miss feely,â€ said topsy, with virtuous gravity;
â€œitâ€™s jist the truth iâ€™ve been a tellin now, and anâ€™t nothin else.â€

â€œtopsy, i shall have to whip you, if you tell lies so.â€

â€œlaws, missis, if youâ€™s to whip all day, couldnâ€™t say no other way,â€
 said topsy, beginning to blubber. â€œi never seed dat ar,--it must a got
caught in my sleeve. miss feeley must have left it on the bed, and it
got caught
 
 ___________________________
 
 in the clothes, and so got in my sleeve.â€

miss ophelia was so indignant at the barefaced lie, that she caught the
child and shook her.

â€œdonâ€™t you tell me that again!â€

the shake brought the glove on to the floor, from the other sleeve.

â€œthere, you!â€ said miss ophelia, â€œwill you tell me now, you didnâ€™t steal
the ribbon?â€

topsy now confessed to the gloves, but still persisted in denying the
ribbon.

â€œnow, topsy,â€ said miss ophelia, â€œif youâ€™ll confess all about it, i
wonâ€™t whip you this time.â€ thus adjured, topsy confessed to the ribbon
and gloves, with woful protestations of penitence.

â€œwell, now, tell me. i know you must have taken other things since you
have been in the house, for i let you run about all day yesterday. now,
tell me if you took anything, and i shanâ€™t whip you.â€

â€œlaws, missis! i took miss evaâ€™s red thing she wars on her neck.â€

â€œyou did, you naughty child!--well, what else?â€

â€

œi took rosaâ€™s yer-rings,--them red ones.â€

â€œgo bring them to me this minute, both of â€˜em.â€

â€œlaws, missis! i canâ€™t,--they â€˜s burnt up!â€

â€œburnt up!--what a story! go get â€˜em, or iâ€™ll whip you.â€

topsy, with loud protestations, and tears, and groans, declared that she
_could_ not. â€œthey â€˜s burnt up,--they was.â€

â€œwhat did you burn â€˜em for?â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œcause i â€˜s wicked,--i is. i â€˜s mighty wicked, any how. i canâ€™t help
it.â€

just at this moment, eva came innocently into the room, with the
identical coral necklace on her neck.

â€œwhy, eva, where did you get your necklace?â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œget it? why, iâ€™ve had it on all day,â€ said eva.

â€œdid you have it on yesterday?â€

â€œyes; and what is funny, aunty, i had it on all night. i forgot to take
it off when i went to bed.â€

miss ophelia looked perfectly bewildered;

came into the room, with a basket of newly-ironed linen poised
on her head, and the coral ear-drops shaking in her ears!

â€œiâ€™m sure i canâ€™t tell anything what to do with such a child!â€ she said,
in despair. â€œwhat in the world did you tell me you took those things
for, topsy?â€

â€œwhy, missis said i must â€˜fess; and i couldnâ€™t think of nothinâ€™ else to
â€˜fess,â€ said topsy, rubbing her eyes.

â€œbut, of course, i didnâ€™t want you to confess things you didnâ€™t do,â€
 said miss ophelia; â€œthatâ€™s telling a lie, just as much as the other.â€

â€œlaws, now, is it?â€ said topsy, with an air of innocent wonder.

â€œla, there anâ€™t any such thing as truth in that limb,â€ said rosa,
looking indignantly at topsy. â€œif i was masâ€™r st. clare, iâ€™d whip her
till the blood run. i would,--iâ€™d let her catch it!â€

â€œno, no rosa,â€ said eva, with an air of command, which the child could
assume at times; â€œyou mustnâ€™t talk so, rosa. i canâ€™t bear to hear it.â€

â€œla sake

representatives of their races. the saxon, born of ages of cultivation,
command, education, physical and moral eminence; the afric, born of ages
of oppression, submission, ignorance, toil and vice!

something, perhaps, of such thoughts struggled through evaâ€™s mind. but a
childâ€™s thoughts are rather dim, undefined instincts; and in evaâ€™s noble
nature many such were yearning and working, for which she had no power
of utterance. when miss ophelia expatiated on topsyâ€™s naughty, wicked
conduct, the child looked perplexed and sorrowful, but said, sweetly.

â€œpoor topsy, why need you steal? youâ€™re going to be taken good care of
now. iâ€™m sure iâ€™d rather give you anything of mine, than have you steal
it.â€

it was the first word of kindness the child had ever heard in her life;
and the sweet tone and manner struck strangely on the wild, rude
heart, and a sparkle of something like a tear shone in the keen, round,
glittering eye; but 
 
 ___________________________
 
it was followed by the short laugh and habitual
grin. no! the ear that has never heard anything but abuse is strangely
incredulous of anything so heavenly as kindness; and topsy only thought
evaâ€™s speech something funny and inexplicable,--she did not believe it.

but what was to be done with topsy? miss ophelia found the case a
puzzler; her rules for bringing up didnâ€™t seem to apply. she thought she
would take time to think of it; and, by the way of gaining time, and in
hopes of some indefinite moral virtues supposed to be inherent in dark
closets, miss ophelia shut topsy up in one till she had arranged her
ideas further on the subject.

â€œi donâ€™t see,â€ said miss ophelia to st. clare, â€œhow iâ€™m going to manage
that child, without whipping her.â€

â€œwell, whip her, then, to your heartâ€™s c

ontent; iâ€™ll give you full power
to do what you like.â€

â€œchildren always have to be whipped,â€ said miss ophelia; â€œi never heard
of bringing them up without.â€

â€œo, well, certainly,â€ said st. clare; â€œdo as you think best. only iâ€™ll
make one suggestion: iâ€™ve seen this child whipped with a poker, knocked
down with the shovel or tongs, whichever came handiest, &c.; and, seeing
that she is used to that style of operation, i think your whippings will
have to be pretty energetic, to make much impression.â€

â€œwhat is to be done with her, then?â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œyou have started a serious 
 
 ___________________________
 
question,â€ said st. clare; â€œi wish youâ€™d
answer it. what is to be done with a human being that can be governed
only by the lash,--_that_ fails,--itâ€™s a very common state of things
down here!â€

â€œiâ€™m sure i donâ€™t know; i never saw such a child as this.â€

â€œsuch children are very common among us, and such men and women, too.
how are they to be governed?â€ said st. clare.

â€œiâ€™m sure itâ€™s more than i can say,â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œor i either,â€ said st. clare. â€œthe horrid cruelties and outrages that
once and a while find their way into the papers,--such cases as prueâ€™s,
for example,--what do they come from? in many cases, it is a gradual
hardening process on both sides,--the owner growing more and more
cruel, as the servant more and more callous. whipping and abuse are like
laudanum; you have to double the dose as the sensibilities decline.
i saw this very early when i became an owner; and i resolved never to

 
 ___________________________
 
begin, because i did not know when i should stop,--and i resolved,
at least, to protect my own moral nature. the consequence is, that my
servants act like spoiled children; but i think that better than for us
both to be brutalized together. you have talked a great deal about our
responsibilities in educating, cousin. i really wanted you to _try_ with
one child, who is a specimen of thousands among us.â€

â€œit is your system makes such children,â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œi know it; but they are _made_,--they exist,--and what _is_ to be done
with them?â€

â€œwell, i canâ€™t say i thank you for the experiment. but, then, as it
appears to be a duty, i shall persevere and try, and do the best i
can,â€ said miss ophelia; and miss ophelia, after this, did labor, with
a commendable degree of zeal and energy, on her new subject. she
instituted regular hours and employments for her, and undertook to teach
her to read and sew.

in the former art, the child was qui

psy was soon a noted character in the establishment. her talent for
every species of drollery, grimace, and mimicry,--for dancing, tumbling,
climbing, singing, whistling, imitating every sound that hit her
fancy,--seemed inexhaustible. in her play-hours, she invariably had
every child in the establishment at her heels, open-mouthed with
admiration and wonder,--not excepting miss eva, who appeared to be
fascinated by her wild diablerie, as a dove is sometimes charmed by
a glittering serpent. miss ophelia was uneasy that eva should fancy
topsyâ€™s society so much, and implored st. clare to forbid it.

â€œpoh! let the child alone,â€ said st. clare. â€œtopsy will do her good.â€

â€œbut so depraved a child,--are you not afraid she will teach her some
mischief?â€

â€œshe canâ€™t teach her mischief; she might teach it to some children, but
evil rolls off evaâ€™s mind like dew off a cabbage-leaf,--not a drop sinks
in.â€

â€œdonâ€™t be too sure,â€ said miss ophelia. â€œi know iâ€™d never let a chi

unaccountably deluge them from above when in full gala dress;-and on all
these occasions, when investigation was made, there was nobody found to
stand sponsor for the indignity. topsy was cited, and had up before
all the domestic judicatories, time and again; but always sustained her
examinations with most edifying innocence and gravity of appearance.
nobody in the world ever doubted who did the things; but not a scrap of
any direct evidence could be found to establish the suppositions, and
miss ophelia was too just to feel at liberty to proceed to any length
without it.

the mischiefs done were always so nicely timed, also, as further to
shelter the aggressor. thus, the times for revenge on rosa and jane,
the two chamber maids, were always chosen in those seasons when (as not
unfrequently happened) they were in disgrace with their mistress, when
any complaint from them would of course meet with no sympathy. in short,
topsy soon made the household understand the propriety of letting her
alone;
 
 ___________________________
 
 and she was let alone, accordingly.

topsy was smart and energetic in all manual operations, learning
everything that was taught her with surprising quickness. with a few
lessons, she had learned to do the proprieties of miss opheliaâ€™s chamber
in a way with which even that particular lady could find no fault.
mortal hands could not lay spread smoother, adjust pillows more
accurately, sweep and dust and arrange more perfectly, than topsy, when
she chose,--but she didnâ€™t very often choose. if miss ophelia, after
three or four days of careful patient supervision, was so sanguine as
to suppose that topsy had at last fallen into her way, could do without
over-looking, and so go off and busy herself about something else, tops

would hold a perfect carnival of confusion, for some one or two hours.
instead of making the bed, she would amuse herself with pulling off the
pillowcases, butting her woolly head among the pillows, till it would
sometimes be grotesquely ornamented with feathers sticking out in
various directions; she would climb the posts, and hang head downward
from the tops; flourish the sheets and spreads all over the apartment;
dress the bolster up in miss opheliaâ€™s night-clothes, and enact various
performances with that,--singing and whistling, and making grimaces
at herself in the looking-glass; in short, as miss ophelia phrased it,
â€œraising cainâ€ generally.

on one occasion, miss ophelia found topsy with her very best scarlet
india canton crape shawl wound round her head for a turban, going on
with her rehearsals before the glass in great style,--miss ophelia
having, with carelessness most unheard-of in her, left the key for once
in her drawer.

the end of all patience, â€œwhat does make
you act so?â€

â€œdunno, missis,--i spects cause i â€˜s so wicked!â€

â€œi donâ€™t know anything what i shall do with you, topsy.â€

â€œlaw, missis, you must whip me; my old missis allers whipped me. i anâ€™t
used to workinâ€™ unless i gets whipped.â€

â€œwhy, topsy, i donâ€™t want to whip you. you can do well, if youâ€™ve a mind
to; what is the reason you wonâ€™t?â€

â€œlaws, missis, i â€˜s used to whippinâ€™; i spects itâ€™s good for me.â€

miss ophelia tried the recipe, and topsy invariably made a terrible
commotion, screaming, groaning and imploring, though half an hour
afterwards, when roosted on some projection of the balcony, and
surrounded by a flock of admiring â€œyoung uns,â€ she would express the
utmost contempt of the whole affair.

â€œlaw, miss feely whip!--wouldnâ€™t kill a skeeter, her whippins. oughter
see how old masâ€™r made the flesh fly; old masâ€™r knowâ€™d how!â€

topsy always made great capital of her own sins and enormi

canâ€™t nobody do nothinâ€™ with me. i used to keep old missis a swarinâ€™ at
me half de time. i spects i â€˜s the wickedest critter in the world;â€
 and topsy would cut a summerset, and come up brisk and shining on to a
higher perch, and evidently plume herself on the distinction.

miss ophelia busied herself very earnestly on sundays, teaching topsy
the catechism. topsy had an uncommon verbal memory, and committed with a
fluency that greatly encouraged her instructress.

â€œwhat good do you expect it is going to do her?â€ said st. clare.

â€œwhy, it always has done children good. itâ€™s what children always have
to learn, you know,â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œunderstand it or not,â€ said st. clare.

â€œo, children never understand it at the time; but, after they are grown
up, itâ€™ll

â€œmine hasnâ€™t come to me yet,â€ said st. clare, â€œthough iâ€™ll bear
testimony that you put it into me pretty thoroughly when i was a boy.â€â€™

â€œah, you were always good at learning, augustine. i used to have great
hopes of you,â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œwell, havenâ€™t you now?â€ said st. clare.

â€œi wish you were as good as you were when you were a boy, augustine.â€

â€œso do i, thatâ€™s a fact, cousin,â€ said st. clare. â€œwell, go ahead and
catechize topsy; may be youâ€™ll make out something yet.â€

topsy, who had stood like a black statue during this discussion, with
hands decently folded, now, at a signal from miss ophelia, went on:

â€œour first parents, being left to the freedom of their own will, fell
from the state wherein t

topsyâ€™s eyes twinkled, and she looked inquiringly.

â€œwhat is it, topsy?â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œplease, missis, was dat ar state kintuck?â€

â€œwhat state, topsy?â€

â€œdat state dey fell out of. i used to hear masâ€™r tell how we came down
from kintuck.â€

st. clare laughed.

â€œyouâ€™ll have to give her a meaning, or sheâ€™ll make one,â€ said he. â€œthere
seems to be a theory of emigration suggested there.â€

â€œo! augustine, be still,â€ said miss ophelia; â€œhow can i do anything, if
you will be laughing?â€

â€œwell, i wonâ€™t disturb the exercises again, on my honor;â€ and st. clare
took his paper into the parlor, and sat down, till topsy had finished
her recitations. they were all very well, only that now and then she
would oddly transpose some important words, and persist in the mistake,
in spite of every effort to the contrary; and st. clare, after all his
promises of goodness, took a wicked pleasure in these mistakes, calling

repeat the offending passages, in spite of miss opheliaâ€™s remonstrances.

â€œhow do you think i can do anything with the child, if you will go on
so, augustine?â€ she would say.

â€œwell, it is too bad,--i wonâ€™t again; but i do like to hear the droll
little image stumble over those big words!â€

â€œbut you confirm her in the wrong way.â€

â€œwhatâ€™s the odds? one word is as good as another to her.â€

â€œyou wanted me to bring her up right; and you ought to remember she is a
reasonable creature, and be careful of your influence over her.â€

â€œo, dismal! so i ought; but, as topsy herself says, â€˜i â€˜s so wicked!â€™â€

in very much this way topsyâ€™s training proceeded, for a year or
two,--miss ophelia worrying herself, from day to day, with her, as a
kind of chronic plague, to whose inflictions she became, in time, as
accustomed, as persons sometimes do to the neuralgia or sick headache.

st. clare took the same kind of amusement in the child that a man might
in the tricks of a parrot or a pointer. topsy, whenever her sins brought
her into disgrace in other quarters, always took refuge behind his
chair; and st. clare, in one way or other, would make peace for her.

â€œiâ€™m going _there_,â€ she said, â€œto the spirits bright, tom; _iâ€™m going,
before long_.â€

the faithful old heart felt a sudden thrust; and tom thought how often
he had noticed, within six months, that evaâ€™s little hands had grown
thinner, and her skin more transparent, and her breath shorter; and how,
when she ran or played in the garden, as she once could for hours, she
became soon so tired and languid. he had heard miss ophelia speak often
of a cough, that all her medicaments could not cure; and even now that
fervent cheek and little hand were burning with hectic fever; and yet
the thought that evaâ€™s words suggested had never come to him till now.

has there ever been a child like eva? yes, there have been; but their
names are always on grave-stones, and their sweet smiles, their heavenly
eyes, their singular words and ways, are among the buried treasures of
yearning hearts. in how many families do you hear the lege

their homeward flight. when you see that deep, spiritual light in the
eye,--when the little soul reveals itself in words sweeter and wiser
than the ordinary words of children,--hope not to retain that child; for
the seal of heaven is on it, and the light of immortality looks out from
its eyes.

even so, beloved eva! fair star of thy dwelling! thou art passing away;
but they that love thee dearest know it not.

the colloquy between tom and eva was interrupted by a hasty call from
miss ophelia.

â€œeva--eva!--why, child, the dew is falling; you mustnâ€™t be out there!â€

eva and tom hastened in.

miss ophelia was old, and skilled in the tactics of nursing. she was
from new england, and knew well the first guileful footsteps of that
soft, insidious disease, which sweeps away so many of the fairest
and loveliest, and, before one fibre of life seems broken, seals them
irrevocably for death.

she had noted the slight, dry cough, the daily brightening cheek;
nor could the lustre of the e

do.â€

â€œwhy donâ€™t they?â€ said eva.

â€œbecause it is no use for them to read. it donâ€™t help them to work any
better, and they are not made for anything else.â€

â€œbut they ought to read the bible, mamma, to learn godâ€™s will.â€

â€œo! they can get that read to them all _they_ need.â€

â€œit seems to me, mamma, the bible is for every one to read themselves.
they need it a great many times when there is nobody to read it.â€

â€œeva, you are an odd child,â€ said her mother.

â€œmiss ophelia has taught topsy to read,â€ continued eva.

â€œyes, and you see how much good it does. topsy is the worst creature i
ever saw!â€

â€œhereâ€™s poor mammy!â€ said eva. â€œshe does love the bible so much, and
wishes so she could read! and what will she do when i canâ€™t read to
her?â€

marie was busy, turning over the contents of a drawer, as she answered,

â€œwell, of course, by and by, eva, you will have other things to think
of besides reading the bible round to servants. not but that is ve

studying out
two or three new forms of disease to which she believed she herself was
a victim. it was the first principle of marieâ€™s belief that nobody ever
was or could be so great a sufferer as _herself_; and, therefore, she
always repelled quite indignantly any suggestion that any one around her
could be sick. she was always sure, in such a case, that it was nothing
but laziness, or want of energy; and that, if they had had the suffering
_she_ had, they would soon know the difference.

miss ophelia had several times tried to awaken her maternal fears about
eva; but to no avail.

â€œi donâ€™t see as anything ails the child,â€ she would say; â€œshe runs
about, and plays.â€

â€œbut she has a cough.â€

â€œcough! you donâ€™t need to tell _me_ about a cough. iâ€™ve always been
subject to a cough, all my days. when i was of evaâ€™s age, they thought
i was in a consumption. night after night, mammy used to sit up with me.
o! evaâ€™s cough is not anything.â€

â€œbut she gets weak, and is short

-breathed.â€

â€œlaw! iâ€™ve had that, years and years; itâ€™s only a nervous affection.â€

â€œbut she sweats so, nights!â€

â€œwell, i have, these ten years. very often, night after night, my
clothes will be wringing wet. there wonâ€™t be a dry thread in my
night-clothes and the sheets will be so that mammy has to hang them up
to dry! eva doesnâ€™t sweat anything like that!â€

miss ophelia shut her mouth for a season. but, now that eva was fairly
and visibly prostrated, and a doctor called, marie, all on a sudden,
took a new turn.

â€œshe knew it,â€ she said; â€œshe always felt it, that she was destined
to be the most miserable of mothers. here she was, with her wretched
health, and her only darling child going down to the grave before her
eyes;â€--and marie routed up mammy nights, and rumpussed and scolded,
with more energy than ever, all day, on the strength of this new miser

; and nearly cried her little eyes out, in pity for her mamma,
and in sorrow that she should make her so much distress.

in a week or two, there was a great improvement of symptoms,--one of
those deceitful lulls, by which her inexorable disease so often beguiles
the anxious heart, even on the verge of the grave. evaâ€™s step was again
in the garden,--in the balconies; she played and laughed again,--and
her father, in a transport, declared that they should soon have her
as hearty as anybody. miss ophelia and the physician alone felt no
encouragement from this illusive truce. there was one other heart, too,
that felt the same certainty, and that was the little heart of eva. what
is it that sometimes speaks in the soul so calmly, so clearly, that its
earthly time is short? is it the secret instinct of decaying nature, or
the soulâ€™s impulsive throb, as immortality draws on? be it what it may,
it rested in the heart of eva, a calm, sweet, prophetic certainty
that heaven was near; calm as the ligh

was stretched on a bamboo lounge in
the verandah, solacing himself with a cigar. marie lay reclined on a
sofa, opposite the window opening on the verandah, closely secluded,
under an awning of transparent gauze, from the outrages of the
mosquitos, and languidly holding in her hand an elegantly bound
prayer-book. she was holding it because it was sunday, and she imagined
she had been reading it,--though, in fact, she had been only taking a
succession of short naps, with it open in her hand.

miss ophelia, who, after some rummaging, had hunted up a small methodist
meeting within riding distance, had gone out, with tom as driver, to
attend it; and eva had accompanied them.

â€œi say, augustine,â€ said marie after dozing a while, â€œi must send to the
city after my old doctor posey; iâ€™m sure iâ€™ve got the complaint of the
heart.â€

â€œwell; why need you send for him? this doctor that attends eva seems
skilful.â€

â€œi would not trust him in a critical case,â€ said marie; â€œand i think
i ma
 
 ___________________________
 
 only hope you wonâ€™t be sorry for this, when itâ€™s too late!â€
 said marie; â€œbut, believe it or not, my distress about eva, and the
exertions i have made with that dear child, have developed what i have
long suspected.â€

what the _exertions_ were which marie referred to, it would have been
difficult to state. st. clare quietly made this commentary to himself,
and went on smoking, like a hard-hearted wretch of a man as he was,
till a carriage drove up before the verandah, and eva and miss ophelia
alighted.

miss ophelia marched straight to her own chamber, to put away her bonnet
and shawl, as was always her manner, before she spoke a word on any
subject; while eva came, at st. clareâ€™s call, and was sitting on his
knee, giving him an account of the services they had heard.

they soon heard loud exclamations from miss opheliaâ€™s room, which,
like the one in which they were sitting, opened on to the verandah and
violent reproof addressed to somebody.

â€œwhat new witchcraft has tops bee

commotion is of her raising, iâ€™ll be bound!â€

and, in a moment after, miss ophelia, in high indignation, came dragging
the culprit along.

â€œcome out here, now!â€ she said. â€œi _will_ tell your master!â€

â€œwhatâ€™s the case now?â€ asked augustine.

â€œthe case is, that i cannot be plagued with this child, any longer! itâ€™s
past all bearing; flesh and blood cannot endure it! here, i locked her
up, and gave her a hymn to study; and what does she do, but spy
out where i put my key, and has gone to my bureau, and got a
bonnet-trimming, and cut it all to pieces to make dol

™d send that child out,
and have her thoroughly whipped; iâ€™d have her whipped till she couldnâ€™t
stand!â€

â€œi donâ€™t doubt it,â€ said st. clare. â€œtell me of the lovely rule of
woman! i never saw above a dozen women that wouldnâ€™t half kill a horse,
or a servant, either, if they had their own way with them!--let alone a
man.â€

â€œthere is no use in this shilly-shally way of yours, st. clare!â€ said
marie. â€œcousin is a woman of sense, and she sees it now, as plain as i
do.â€

miss ophelia had just the capability of indignation that belongs to the
thorough-paced housekeeper, and this had been pretty actively roused
by the artifice and wastefulness of the child; in fact, many of my
lady readers must own that they should have felt just so in her
circumstances; but marieâ€™s words went beyond her, and she felt less
heat.

â€œi wouldnâ€™t have the child treated so, for the world,â€ she said; â€œbut,
i am sure, augustine, i donâ€™t know what to do. iâ€™ve taught and taught;

ay i can think of, and sheâ€™s just what she was at first.â€

â€œcome here, tops, you monkey!â€ said st. clare, calling the child up to
him.

topsy came up; her round, hard eyes glittering and blinking with a
mixture of apprehensiveness and their usual odd drollery.

â€œwhat makes you behave so?â€ said st. clare, who could not help being
amused with the childâ€™s expression.

â€œspects itâ€™s my wicked heart,â€ said topsy, demurely; â€œmiss feely says
so.â€

â€œdonâ€™t you see how much miss ophelia has done for you? she says she has
done everything she can think of.â€

â€œlor, yes, masâ€™r! old missis used to say so, too. she whipped me a heap
harder, and used to pull my har, and knock my head agin the door; but
it didnâ€™t do me no good! i spects, if they â€˜s to pull every spire oâ€™ har
out oâ€™ my head, it wouldnâ€™t do no good, neither,--i â€˜s so wicked! laws!
i â€˜s nothin but a nigger, no ways!â€

â€œwell, i shall have to give her up,â€ said miss ophelia; â€œi canâ€™t have
that

 trouble any longer.â€

â€œwell, iâ€™d just like to ask one question,â€ said st. clare.

â€œwhat is it?â€

â€œwhy, if your gospel is not strong enough to save one heathen child,
that you can have at home here, all to yourself, whatâ€™s the use of
sending one or two poor missionaries off with it among thousands of just
such? i suppose this child is about a fair sample of what thousands of
your heathen are.â€

miss ophelia did not make an immediate answer; and eva, who had stood a
silent spectator of the scene thus far, made a silent sign to topsy to
follow her. there was a little glass-room at the corner of the verandah,
which st. clare used as a sort of reading-room; and eva and topsy
disappeared into this place.

â€œwhatâ€™s eva going about, now?â€ said st. clare; â€œi mean to see.â€

and, advancing on tiptoe, he lifted up a curtain that covered the
glass-door, and looked in. in a moment, laying his finger o

he made a silent gesture to miss ophelia to come and look. there sat the
two children on the floor, with their side faces towards them. topsy,
with her usual air of careless drollery and unconcern; but, opposite to
her, eva, her whole face fervent with feeling, and tears in her large
eyes.

â€œwhat does make you so bad, topsy? why wonâ€™t you try and be good? donâ€™t
you love _anybody_, topsy?â€

â€œdonno nothing â€˜bout love; i loves candy and sich, thatâ€™s all,â€ said
topsy.

â€œbut you love your father and mother?â€

ad none, ye know. i telled ye that, miss eva.â€

â€œo, i know,â€ said eva, sadly; â€œbut hadnâ€™t you any brother, or sister, or
aunt, or--â€

â€œno, none on â€˜em,--never had nothing nor nobody.â€

â€œbut, topsy, if youâ€™d only try to be good, you might--â€

â€œcouldnâ€™t never be nothinâ€™ but a nigger, if i was ever so good,â€ said
topsy. â€œif i could be skinned, and come white, iâ€™d try then.â€

â€œbut people can love you, if you are black, topsy. miss ophelia would
love you, if you were good.â€

topsy gave the short, blunt laugh that was her common mode of expressing
incredulity.

â€œdonâ€™t you think so?â€ said eva.

â€œno; she canâ€™t bar me, â€˜cause iâ€™m a nigger!--sheâ€™d â€˜s soon have a
toad touch her! there canâ€™t nobody love niggers, and niggers canâ€™t do
nothinâ€™! _i_ donâ€™t care,â€ said topsy, beginning to whistle.

â€œo, topsy, poor child, _i_ love you!â€ said eva, with a sudden burst of
feeling, and laying her little thin, whit

to heaven at last, and be an angel forever, just as much as if you

bright, uncle tom sings about.â€

â€œo, dear miss eva, dear miss eva!â€ said the child; â€œi will try, i will
try; i never did care nothinâ€™ about it before.â€

st. clare, at this instant, dropped the curtain. â€œit puts me in mind of
mother,â€ he said to miss ophelia. â€œit is true what she told me; if we
want to give sight to the blind, we must be willing to do as christ
did,--call them to us, and _put our hands on them_.â€

â€œiâ€™ve always had a prejudice against negroes,â€ said miss ophelia, â€œand
itâ€™s a fact, i never could bear to have that child touch me; but, i
donâ€™t think she knew it.â€

â€œtrust any child to find that out,â€ said st. clare; â€œthereâ€™s no keeping
it from them. but i believe that all the trying in the world to benefit

ild, and all the substantial favors you can do them, will never
excite one emotion of gratitude, while that feeling of repugnance
remains in the heart;--itâ€™s a queer kind of a fact,--but so it is.â€

â€œi donâ€™t know how i can help it,â€ said miss ophelia; â€œthey _are_
disagreeable to me,--this child in particular,--how can i help feeling
so?â€

â€œeva does, it seems.â€

â€œwell, sheâ€™s so loving! after all, though, sheâ€™s no more than
christ-like,â€ said miss ophelia; â€œi wish i were like her. she might
teach me a lesson.â€

â€œit wouldnâ€™t be the first time a little child had been used to instruct
an old disciple, if it _were_ so,â€ said st. clare.

death

     weep not for those whom the veil of the tomb,
     in lifeâ€™s early morning, hath hid from our eyes.*


     * â€œweep not for those,â€ a poem by thomas moore (1779-1852).

evaâ€™s bed-room was a spacious apartment, which, like all the other
rooms in the house, opened on to the

 broad verandah. the room
communicated, on one side, with her father and motherâ€™s apartment;
on the other, with that appropriated to miss ophelia. st. clare had
gratified his own eye and taste, in furnishing this room in a style
that had a peculiar keeping with the character of her for whom it was
intended. the windows were hung with curtains of rose-colored and white
muslin, the floor was spread with a matting which had been ordered
in paris, to a pattern of his own device, having round it a border of
rose-buds and leaves, and a centre-piece with full-flown roses. the
bedstead, chairs, and lounges, were of bamboo, wrought in peculiarly

ly can be,â€ said eva, â€œiâ€™m so sorry to think of poor folks that
havenâ€™t any.â€

â€œthatâ€™s odd enough,â€ said marie;--â€œiâ€™m sure my religion makes me
thankful for my advantages.â€

â€œmamma,â€ said eva, â€œi want to have some of my hair cut off,--a good deal
of it.â€

â€œwhat for?â€ said marie.

â€œmamma, i want to give some away to my friends, while i am able to give
it to them myself. wonâ€™t you ask aunty to come and cut it for me?â€

marie raised her voice, and called miss ophelia, from the other room.

the child half rose from her pillow as she came in, and, shaking down
her long golden-brown curls, said, rather playfully, â€œcome aunty, shear
the sheep!â€

â€œwhatâ€™s that?â€ said st. clare, who just then entered with some fruit he
had been out to get for her.

â€œpapa, i just want aunty to cut off some of my hair;--thereâ€™s too much
of it, and it makes my head hot. besides, i want to give some of it
away.â€

miss ophelia came, with her scissors.

â€œtake care,--do

e
some things i want to say and do,--that i ought to do; and you are so
unwilling to have me speak a word on this subject. but it must come;
thereâ€™s no putting it off. do be willing i should speak now!â€

â€œmy child, i _am_ willing!â€ said st. clare, covering his eyes with one
hand, and holding up evaâ€™s hand with the other.

â€œthen, i want to see all our people together. i have some things i
_must_ say to them,â€ said eva.

â€œ_well_,â€ said st. clare, in a tone of dry endurance.

miss ophelia despatched a messenger, and soon the whole of the servants
were convened in the room.

eva lay back on her pillows; her hair hanging loosely about her face,
her crimson cheeks contrasting painfully with the intense whiteness of
her complexion and the thin contour of her limbs and features, and her
large, soul-like eyes fixed earnestly on every one.

the servants were struck with a sudden emotion. the spiritual face, the
long locks of hair cut off and lying by her, her fatherâ€™s averted face,

heaven, and that i want to see you all there.â€

it is impossible to describe the scene, as, with tears and sobs, they
gathered round the little creature, and took from her hands what seemed
to them a last mark of her love. they fell on their knees; they sobbed,
and prayed, and kissed the hem of her garment; and the elder ones poured
forth words of endearment, mingled in prayers and blessings, after the
manner of their susceptible race.

as each one took their gift, miss ophelia, who was apprehensive for the
effect of all this excitement on her little patient, signed to each one
to pass out of the apartment.

at last, all were gone but tom and mammy.

â€œhere, uncle tom,â€ said eva, â€œis a beautiful one for you. o, i am so
happy, uncle tom, to think i shall see you in heaven,--for iâ€™m sure i
shall; and mammy,--dear, good, kind mammy!â€ she said, fondly throwing
her arms round her old nurse,--â€œi know youâ€™ll be there, too.â€

â€œo, miss eva, donâ€™t see how i c

an live without ye, no how!â€ said the
faithful creature. â€œâ€˜pears like itâ€™s just taking everything off the
place to oncet!â€ and mammy gave way to a passion of grief.

miss ophelia pushed her and tom gently from the apartment, and thought
they were all gone; but, as she turned, topsy was standing there.

â€œwhere did you start up from?â€ she said, suddenly.

â€œi was here,â€ said topsy, wiping the tears from her eyes. â€œo, miss eva,
iâ€™ve been a bad girl; but wonâ€™t you give _me_ one, too?â€

â€œyes, poor topsy! to be sure, i will. there--every time you look at
that, think that i love you, and wanted you to be a good girl!â€

â€œo, miss eva, i _is_ tryin!â€ said t

opsy, earnestly; â€œbut, lor, itâ€™s so
hard to be good! â€˜pears like i anâ€™t used to it, no ways!â€

â€œjesus knows it, topsy; he is sorry for you; he will help you.â€

topsy, with her eyes hid in her apron, was silently passed from the
apartment by miss ophelia; but, as she went, she hid the precious curl
in her bosom.

all being gone, miss ophelia shut the door. that worthy lady had wiped
away many tears of her own, during the scene; but concern for the
consequence of such an excitement to her young charge was uppermost in
her mind.

st. clare had been sitting, during the whole time, with his hand shading
his eyes, in the same attitude.

when they were all gone, he sat so still.

â€œpapa!â€ said eva, gently, laying her hand on his.

he gave a sudden start and shiver; but made no answer.

â€œdear papa!â€ said eva.

â€œ_i cannot_,â€ sai

d st. clare, rising, â€œi _cannot_ have it so! the
almighty hath dealt _very bitterly_ with me!â€ and st. clare pronounced
these words with a bitter emphasis, indeed.

â€œaugustine! has not god a right to do what he will with his own?â€ said
miss ophelia.

â€œperhaps so; but that doesnâ€™t make it any easier to bear,â€ said he, with
a dry, hard, tearless manner, as he turned away.

â€œpapa, you break my heart!â€ said eva, rising and throwing herself into
his arms; â€œyou must not feel so!â€ and the child sobbed and wept with
a violence which alarmed them all, and turned her fatherâ€™s thoughts at
once to another channel.

â€œthere, eva,--there, dearest! hush! hush! i was wrong; i was wicked. i
will feel any way, do any way,--only donâ€™t dis

ertainly i do.â€

â€œyou never saw him,â€ said st. clare.

â€œthat makes no difference,â€ said eva. â€œi believe him, and in a few days
i shall _see_ him;â€ and the young face grew fervent, radiant with joy.

st. clare said no more. it was a feeling which he had seen before in his
mother; but no chord within vibrated to it.

eva, after this, declined rapidly; there was no more any doubt of the
event; the fondest hope could not be blinded. her beautiful room was
avowedly a sick room; and miss ophelia day and night performed the
duties of a nurse,--and never did her friends appreciate her value more
than in that capacity. with so well-trained a hand and eye, such perfect
adroitness and practice in every art which could promote neatness
and comfort, and keep out of sight every disagreeable incident of
sickness,--with such a perfect sense of time, such a clear, untroubled
head, such exact accuracy in remembering every prescription and
direction of the doctors,--she was everything to him. they

most of evaâ€™s own imaginings and foreshadowings was
her faithful bearer, tom. to him she said what she would not disturb her
father by saying. to him she imparted those mysterious intimations which
the soul feels, as the cords begin to unbind, ere it leaves its clay
forever.

tom, at last, would not sleep in his room, but lay all night in the
outer verandah, ready to rouse at every call.

â€œuncle tom, what alive have you taken to sleeping anywhere and
everywhere, like a dog, for?â€ said miss ophelia. â€œi thought you was one
of the orderly sort, that liked to lie in bed in a christian way.â€

â€œi do, miss feely,â€ said tom, mysteriously. â€œi do, but now--â€

â€œwell, what now?â€

â€œwe mustnâ€™t speak loud; masâ€™r st. clare wonâ€™t hear on â€˜t; but miss
feely, you know there must be somebody watchinâ€™ for the bridegroom.â€

â€œwhat do you mean, tom?â€

â€œyou know it says in scripture, â€˜at midnight there was a great cry
made. behold, the bridegroom cometh.â€™ thatâ€™s what iâ€

s feely; for when that ar blessed child goes
into the kingdom, theyâ€™ll open the door so wide, weâ€™ll all get a look in
at the glory, miss feely.â€

â€œuncle tom, did miss eva say she felt more unwell than usual tonight?â€

â€œno; but she telled me, this morning, she was coming nearer,--tharâ€™s
them that tells it to the child, miss feely. itâ€™s the angels,--â€˜itâ€™s
the trumpet sound afore the break oâ€™ day,â€™â€ said tom, quoting from a
favorite hymn.

this dialogue passed between miss ophelia and tom, between ten and
eleven, one evening, after her arrangements had all been made for the
night, when, on going to bolt her outer door, she found tom stretched
along by it, in the outer verandah.

she was not nervous or impressible; but the solemn, heart-felt manner
struck her. eva had been unusually bright and cheerful, that afternoon,
and had sat raised in her bed, and looked over all her little trinkets
and precious things, and designated the friends to whom she would
have them given; a
 
 ___________________________
 
nd her manner was more animated, and her voice more
natural, than they had known it for weeks. her father had been in, in
the evening, and had said that eva appeared more like her former self
than ever she had done since her sickness; and when he kissed her for
the night, he said to miss ophelia,--â€œcousin, we may keep her with us,
after all; she is certainly better;â€ and he had retired with a lighter
heart in his bosom than he had had there for weeks.

but at midnight,--strange, mystic hour!--when the veil between the frail
present and the eternal future grows thin,--then came the messenger!

there was a sound in that chamber, first of one who stepped quickly. it
was miss ophelia, who had resolved to sit up all night with her
little charge, and who, at the turn of the night, had di
 
 ___________________________
 
scerned what
experienced nurses significantly call â€œa change.â€ the outer door was
quickly opened, and tom, who was watching outside, was on the alert, in
a moment.

â€œgo for the doctor, tom! lose not a moment,â€ said miss ophelia; and,
stepping across the room, she rapped at st. clareâ€™s door.

â€œcousin,â€ she said, â€œi wish you would come.â€

those words fell on his heart like clods upon a coffin. why did they?
he was up and in the room in an instant, and bending over eva, who still
slept.

what was it he saw that made his heart stand still? why was no word
spoken between the two? thou canst say, who hast seen that same
expression on the face dearest to thee;--that look indescribable,
hopeless, unmistakable, that 
 
 ___________________________
 
 that voices
had said, in the dying chamber, â€œshe is gone,â€ it had been all a dreary
mist, a heavy â€œdimness of anguish.â€ he had heard voices around him; he
had had questions asked, and answered them; they had asked him when
he would have the funeral, and where they should lay her; and he had
answered, impatiently, that he cared not.

adolph and rosa had arranged the chamber; volatile, fickle and childish,
as they generally were, they were soft-hearted and full of feeling;
and, while miss ophelia presided over the general details of order and
neatness, it was their hands that added those soft, poetic touches to
the arrangements, that took from the death-room the grim and ghastly air
which too often marks a new england funeral.

there were still flowers on the shelves,--all white, delicate and
fragrant, with graceful, drooping leaves. evaâ€™s little table, covered
with white, bore on it her favorite vase, with a single white moss
rose-bud in it. the folds of the drapery, the fall of the

œo, do let me! i brought a flower,--such a pretty one!â€ said topsy,
holding up a half-blown tea rose-bud. â€œdo let me put just one there.â€

â€œget along!â€ said rosa, more decidedly.

â€œlet her stay!â€ said st. clare, suddenly stamping his foot. â€œshe shall
come.â€

rosa suddenly retreated, and topsy came forward and laid her offering at
the feet of the corpse; then suddenly, with a wild and bitter cry,
she threw herself on the floor alongside the bed, and wept, and moaned
aloud.

miss ophelia hastened into the room, and tried to raise and silence her;
but in vain.

â€œo, miss eva! oh, miss eva! i wish i â€˜s dead, too,--i do!â€

there was a piercing wildness in the cry; the blood flushed into st.
clareâ€™s white, marble-like face, and the first tears he had shed since
eva died stood in his eyes.

â€œget up, child,â€ said miss ophelia, in a softened voice; â€œdonâ€™t cry so.
miss eva is gone to heaven; she is an angel.â€

â€œbut i canâ€™t see her!â€ said topsy. â€œi never shall s

sobbed again.

they all stood a moment in silence.

â€œ_she_ said she _loved_ me,â€ said topsy,--â€œshe did! o, dear! oh, dear!
there anâ€™t _nobody_ left now,--there anâ€™t!â€

â€œthatâ€™s true enoughâ€ said st. clare; â€œbut do,â€ he said to miss ophelia,
â€œsee if you canâ€™t comfort the poor creature.â€

â€œi jist wish i hadnâ€™t never been born,â€ said topsy. â€œi didnâ€™t want to be
born, no ways; and i donâ€™t see no use on â€˜t.â€

miss ophelia raised her gently, but firmly, and took her from the room;
but, as she did so, some tears fell from her eyes.

â€œtopsy, you poor child,â€ she said, as she led her into her room, â€œdonâ€™t
give up! _i_ can love you, though i am not like that dear little child.
i hope iâ€™ve learnt something of the love of christ from her. i can love
you; i do, and iâ€™ll try to help you to grow up a good christian girl.â€

with hurry and bustle, and change of place; and people who saw him in
the street, or met him at the cafe, knew of his loss only by the weed
on his hat; for there he was, smiling and talking, and reading the
newspaper, and speculating on politics, and attending to business
matters; and who could see that all this smiling outside was but a
hollowed shell over a heart that was a dark and silent sepulchre?

â€œmr. st. clare is a singular man,â€ said marie to miss ophelia, in a
complaining tone. â€œi used to think, if there was anything in the world
he did love, it was our dear little eva; but he seems to be forgetting
her very easily. i cannot ever get him to talk about her. i really did
think he would show more feeling!â€

â€œstill waters run deepest, they used to tell me,â€ said miss ophelia,
oracularly.

â€œo, i donâ€™t believe in such things; itâ€™s all talk. if people have
feeling, they will show it,--they canâ€™t help it; but, then, itâ€™s a great

â€œsure, missis, masâ€™r st. clare is gettinâ€™ thin as a shader. they say, he
donâ€™t never eat nothinâ€™,â€ said mammy. â€œi know he donâ€™t forget miss eva;
i know there couldnâ€™t nobody,--dear, little, blessed cretur!â€ she added,
wiping her eyes.

â€œwell, at all events, he has no consideration for me,â€ said marie; â€œhe
hasnâ€™t spoken one word of sympathy, and he must know how much more a
mother feels than any man can.â€

â€œthe heart knoweth its own bitterness,â€ said miss ophelia, gravely.

â€œthatâ€™s just what i think. i know just what i feel,--nobody else seems
to. eva used to, but she is gone!â€ and marie lay back on her lounge, and
began to sob disconsolately.

marie was one of those unfortunately constituted mortals, in whose
eyes whatever is lost and gone assumes a value which it never had in
possession. whatever she had, she seemed to survey only to pick flaws in
it; but, once fairly away, there was no end to her valuation of it.

winning ways and gentle intercessions had so often been a shield to them
from the tyrannical and selfish exactions of her mother. poor old mammy,
in particular, whose heart, severed from all natural domestic ties, had
consoled itself with this one beautiful being, was almost heart-broken.
she cried day and night, and was, from excess of sorrow, less skilful
and alert in her ministrations of her mistress than usual, which drew
down a constant storm of invectives on her defenceless head.

miss ophelia felt the loss; but, in her good and honest heart, it bore
fruit unto everlasting life. she was more softened, more gentle; and,
though equally assiduous in every duty, it was with a chastened and
quiet air, as one who communed with her own heart not in vain. she was
more diligent in teaching topsy,--taught her mainly from the bible,--did
not any longer shrink from her touch, or manifest an ill-repressed
disgust, because she felt none. she viewed her now through the softened
medium that evaâ€™s

hand had first held before her eyes, and saw in her
only an immortal creature, whom god had sent to be led by her to glory
and virtue. topsy did not become at once a saint; but the life and death
of eva did work a marked change in her. the callous indifference was
gone; there was now sensibility, hope, desire, and the striving for
good,--a strife irregular, interrupted, suspended oft, but yet renewed
again.

one day, when topsy had been sent for by miss ophelia, she came, hastily
thrusting something into her bosom.

â€œwhat are you doing there, you limb? youâ€™ve been stealing something,
iâ€™ll be bound,â€ said the imperious little rosa, who had been sent to
call her, seizing her, at the same time, roughly by the arm.

â€œyou go â€˜long, miss rosa!â€ said topsy, pulling from her; â€œâ€˜tanâ€™t none oâ€™
your business!â€

â€œnone oâ€™ your saâ€™ce!â€ said rosa, â€œi saw you hiding something,--i know
yer tricks,â€ and rosa seized her arm, and tried
 
 ___________________________
 
 to force her hand into
her bosom, while topsy, enraged, kicked and fought valiantly for what
she considered her rights. the clamor and confusion of the battle drew
miss ophelia and st. clare both to the spot.

â€œsheâ€™s been stealing!â€ said rosa.

â€œi hanâ€™t, neither!â€ vociferated topsy, sobbing with passion.

â€œgive me that, whatever it is!â€ said miss ophelia, firmly.

topsy hesitated; but, on a second order, pulled out of her bosom a
little parcel done up in the foot of one of her own old stockings.

miss ophelia turned it out. there was a small book, which had been given
to topsy by eva, containing a single verse of scripture, arranged for
every day in the year, and in a paper the curl of hair that she had
given her on that memorable day when she had taken her last farewell.

st. clare was a good deal affected at the sight of it; the little book
h

onâ€™t take â€˜em away, please!â€
 she said; and, sitting flat down on the floor, and putting her apron
over her head, she began to sob vehemently.

it was a curious mixture of the pathetic and the ludicrous,--the little
old stockings,--black crape,--text-book,--fair, soft curl,--and topsyâ€™s
utter distress.

st. clare smiled; but there were tears in his eyes, as he said,

â€œcome, come,--donâ€™t cry; you shall have them!â€ and, putting them
together, he threw them into her lap, and drew miss ophelia with him
into the parlor.

â€œi really think you can make something of that concern,â€ he said,
pointing with his thumb backward over his shoulder. â€œany mind that
is capable of a _real sorrow_ is capable of good. you must try and do
something with her.â€

â€œthe child has improved greatly,â€ said miss ophelia. â€œi have great hopes
of her; but, augustine,â€ she said, laying her hand on his arm, â€œone
thing i want to ask; whose is this child to be?--yours or mine?â€

â€œwhy, i gave her t

o you,â€ said augustine.

â€œbut not legally;--i want her to be mine legally,â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œwhew! cousin,â€ said augustine. â€œwhat will the abolition society think?
theyâ€™ll have a day of fasting appointed for this backsliding, if you
become a slaveholder!â€

â€œo, nonsense! i want her mine, that i may have a right to take her to
the free states, and give her her liberty, that all i am trying to do be
not undone.â€

â€œo, cousin, what an awful â€˜doing evil that good may comeâ€™! i canâ€™t
encourage it.â€

â€œi donâ€™t want you to joke, but to reason,â€ said miss ophelia. 
 
 ___________________________
 
â€œthere is
no use in my trying to make this child a christian child, unless i save
her from all the chances and reverses of slavery; and, if you really are
willing i should have her, i want you to give me a deed of gift, or some
legal paper.â€

â€œwell, well,â€ said st. clare, â€œi will;â€ and he sat down, and unfolded a
newspaper to read.

â€œbut i want it done now,â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œwhatâ€™s your hurry?â€

â€œbecause now is the only time there ever is to do a thing in,â€ said miss
ophelia. â€œcome, now, hereâ€™s paper, pen, and ink; just write a paper.â€

st. clare, like most men of his class of mind, cordially hated the
present tense of action, generally; and, therefore, he was considerably
annoyed by miss opheliaâ€™s downrightness.

â€œwhy, whatâ€™s the matter?â€ said he. â€œcanâ€™t you take my word? one would
think you had taken lessons of the jews, coming at a

 fellow so!â€

â€œi want to make sure of it,â€ said miss ophelia. â€œyou may die, or fail,
and then topsy be hustled off to auction, spite of all i can do.â€

â€œreally, you are quite provident. well, seeing iâ€™m in the hands of a
yankee, there is nothing for it but to concede;â€ and st. clare rapidly
wrote off a deed of gift, which, as he was well versed in the forms
of law, he could easily do, and signed his name to it in sprawling
capitals, concluding by a tremendous flourish.

â€œthere, isnâ€™t that black and white, now, miss vermont?â€ he said, as h

handed it to her.

â€œgood boy,â€ said miss ophelia, smiling. â€œbut must it not be witnessed?â€

â€œo, bother!--yes. here,â€ he said, opening the door into marieâ€™s
apartment, â€œmarie, cousin wants your autograph; just put your name down
here.â€

â€œwhatâ€™s this?â€ said marie, as she ran over the paper. â€œridiculous! i
thought cousin was too pious for such horrid things,â€ she added, as she
carelessly wrote her name; â€œbut, if she has a fancy for that article, i
am sure sheâ€™s welcome.â€

â€œthere, now, sheâ€™s yours, body and soul,

â€ said st. clare, handing the
paper.

â€œno more mine now than she was before,â€ miss ophelia. â€œnobody but god
has a right to give her to me; but i can protect her now.â€

â€œwell, sheâ€™s yours by a fiction of law, then,â€ said st. clare, as he
turned back into the parlor, and sat down to his paper.

miss ophelia, who seldom sat much in marieâ€™s company, followed him into
the parlor, having first carefully laid away the paper.

â€œaugustine,â€ she said, suddenly, as she sat knitting, â€œhave you ever
made any provision for your servants, in case of your death?â€

â€œno,â€ said st. clare, as he read on.

â€œthen all your indulgence to them may prove a great cruelty, by and by.â€

st. clare had often thought the same thing himself; but he answered,
negligently.

â€œwell, i mean to make a provision, b

y and by.â€

â€œwhen?â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œo, one of these days.â€

â€œwhat if you should die first?â€

â€œcousin, whatâ€™s the matter?â€ said st. clare, laying down his paper
and looking at her. â€œdo you think i show symptoms of yellow fever or
cholera, that you are making post mortem arrangements with such zeal?â€

â€œâ€˜in the midst of life we are in death,â€™â€ said miss ophelia.

st. clare rose up, and laying the paper down, carelessly, walked to the
door that stood open on the verandah, to put an end to a conversation
that was not agreeable to him. mechanically, he repeated the last word
again,--_â€œdeath!â€_--and, as he leaned against the railings, and watched
the sparkling water as it rose and fell in the fountain; and, as in a
dim and dizzy haze, saw flowers and trees and vases of the courts, he
repeated, again the mystic word so common in every mouth, yet of suc

ave,--living good, easy, respectable lives;
and not troubling themselves to inquire how many of their brethren were
hungry or athirst, or sick, or in prison.â€

tom did not answer.

st. clare rose up and walked thoughtfully up and down the verandah,
seeming to forget everything in his own thoughts; so absorbed was he,
that tom had to remind him twice that the teabell had rung, before he
could get his attention.

st. clare was absent and thoughtful, all tea-time. after tea, he and
marie and miss ophelia took possession of the parlor almost in silence.

marie disposed herself on a lounge, under a silken mosquito curtain,
and was soon sound asleep. miss ophelia silently busied herself with her
knitting. st. clare sat down to the piano, and began playing a soft and
melancholy movement with the Ã¦olian accompaniment. he seemed in a deep
reverie, and to be soliloquizing to himself by music. after a little, he
opened one of the drawers, took out an old music-book whose leaves were
yellow with age, a

nd began turning it over.

â€œthere,â€ he said to miss ophelia, â€œthis was one of my motherâ€™s
books,--and here is her handwriting,--come and look at it. she copied
and arranged this from mozartâ€™s requiem.â€ miss ophelia came accordingly.

â€œit was something she used to sing often,â€ said st. clare. â€œi think i
can hear her now.â€

he struck a few majestic chords, and began singing that grand old latin
piece, the â€œdies irÃ¦.â€

tom, who was listening in the outer verandah, was drawn by the sound
to the very door, where he stood earnestly. he did not understand the
words, of course; but the music and manner of singing appeared to affect
him strongly, especially when st. clare sang the more pathetic parts.

d
threw out with vivid sympathy those strains which the ethereal mozart
first conceived as his own dying requiem.

when st. clare had done singing, he sat leaning his head upon his hand a
few moments, and then began walking up and down the floor.

â€œwhat a sublime conception is that of a last judgment!â€ said he,--â€œa
righting of all the wrongs of ages!--a solving of all moral problems, by
an unanswerable wisdom! it is, indeed, a wonderful image.â€

â€œit is a fearful one to us,â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œit ought to be to me, i suppose,â€ said st. clare stopping,
thoughtfully. â€œi was reading to tom, this afternoon, that chapter in
matthew that gives an account of it, and i have been quite struck with
it. one should have expected some terrible enormities charged to those
who are excluded from heaven, as the reason; but no,--they are condemned
for _not_ doing positive good, as if that included every possible harm.â€

â€œperhaps,â€ said miss ophelia, â€œit is impossible for a person who

does no
good not to do harm.â€

â€œand what,â€ said st. clare, speaking abstractedly, but with deep
feeling, â€œwhat shall be said of one whose own heart, whose education,
and the wants of society, have called in vain to some noble purpose; who
has floated on, a dreamy, neutral spectator of the struggles, agonies,
and wrongs of man, when he should have been a worker?â€

â€œi should say,â€ said miss ophelia, â€œthat he ought to repent, and begin
now.â€

â€œalways practical and to the point!â€ said st. clare, his face breaking
out into a smile. â€œyou never leave me any time for general reflections,
cousin; you always bring me short up against the actual present; you
have a kind of eternal _now_, always in your mind.â€

â€œ_now_ is all the time i have anything to do with,â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œdear little eva,--poor child!â€ said st. clare, â€œshe had set her little

that is, i mean that _i_ could not be a christian otherwise, though
i have certainly had intercourse with a great many enlightened and
christian people who did no such thing; and i confess that the apathy
of religious people on this subject, their want of perception of wrongs
that filled me with horror, have engendered in me more scepticism than
any other thing.â€

â€œif you knew all this,â€ said miss ophelia, â€œwhy didnâ€™t you do it?â€

â€œo, because i have had only that kind of benevolence which consists in
lying on a sofa, and cursing the church and clergy for not being martyrs
and confessors. one can see, you know, very easily, how others ought to
be martyrs.â€

â€œwell, are you going to do differently now?â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œgod only knows the future,â€ said st. clare. â€œi am braver than i was,
because i have lost all; and he who has nothing to lose can afford all
risks.â€

â€œand

â€œmy duty, i hope, to the poor and lowly, as fast as i find it out,â€ said
st. clare, â€œbeginning with my own servants, for whom i have yet done
nothing; and, perhaps, at some future day, it may appear that i can
do something for a whole class; something to save my country from the
disgrace of that false position in which she now stands before all
civilized nations.â€

â€œdo you suppose it possible that a nation ever will voluntarily
emancipate?â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œi donâ€™t know,â€ said st. clare. â€œthis is a day of great deeds. heroism
and disinterestedness are rising up, here and there, in the earth. the
hungarian nobles set free millions of serfs, at an immense pecuniary
loss; and, perhaps, among us may be found generous spirits, who do not
estimate honor and justice by dollars and cents.â€

â€œi hardly think so,â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œbut, suppose we should rise up tomorrow and emancipate, who would
educate these millions, and teach them h

_obvious_ oppressors of the negro; but the unchristian prejudice of the
north is an oppressor almost equally severe.â€

â€œwell, cousin, i know it is so,â€ said miss ophelia,--â€œi know it was so

have overcome it; and i know there are many good people at the north,
who in this matter need only to be _taught_ what their duty is, to do

us, than to send missionaries to them; but i think we would do it.â€

brought to see as i do. besides, i know there are many people at the
north who do exactly what you said.â€

â€œyes, but they are a minority; and, if we should begin to emancipate to
any extent, we should soon hear from you.â€

miss ophelia did not reply. there was a pause of some moments; and st.
clareâ€™s countenance was overcast by a sad, dreamy expression.

â€œi donâ€™t know what makes me think of my mother so much, tonight,â€ he
said. â€œi have a strange kind of feeling, as if she were near me. i keep
thinking of things she used to say. strange, what brings these past
things so vividly back to us, sometimes!â€

st. clare walked up and down the room for some minutes more, and then
said,

was awakened by a loud knocking, and a sound of many voices at the gate.

he hastened to undo it; and, with smothered voices and heavy tread,
came several men, bringing a body, wrapped in a cloak, and lying on a
shutter. the light of the lamp fell full on the face; and tom gave a
wild cry of amazement and despair, that rung through all the galleries,
as the men advanced, with their burden, to the open parlor door, where
miss ophelia still sat knitting.

st. clare had turned into a cafe, to look over an evening paper. as he
was reading, an affray arose between two gentlemen in the room, who
were both partially intoxicated. st. clare and one or two others made an
effort to separate them, and st. clare received a fatal stab in the side
with a bowie-knife, which he was attempting to wrest from one of them.

the house was full of cries and lamentations, shrieks and screams,
servants frantically tearing their hair, throwing them

ground, or running distractedly about, lamenting. tom and miss ophelia
alone seemed to have any presence of mind; for marie was in strong
hysteric convulsions. at miss opheliaâ€™s direction, one of the lounges in
the parlor was hastily prepared, and the bleeding form laid upon it. st.
clare had fainted, through pain and loss of blood; but, as miss ophelia
applied restoratives, he revived, opened his eyes, looked fixedly on
them, looked earnestly around the room, his eyes travelling wistfully
over every object, and finally they rested on his motherâ€™s picture.

the physician now arrived, and made his examination. it was evident,
from the expression of his face, that there was no hope; but he applied
himself to dressing the wound, and he and miss ophelia and tom proceeded
composedly with this work, amid the lamentations and sobs and cries of
the

affrighted servants, who had clustered about the doors and windows
of the verandah.

â€œnow,â€ said the physician, â€œwe must turn all these creatures out; all

st. clare opened his eyes, and looked fixedly on the distressed beings,
whom miss ophelia and the doctor were trying to urge from the apartment.
â€œpoor creatures!â€ he said, and an expression of bitter self-reproach
passed over his face. adolph absolutely refused to go. terror had
deprived him of all presence of mind; he threw himself along the
floor, and nothing could persuade him to rise. the rest yielded to miss
opheliaâ€™s urgent representations, that their masterâ€™s safety depended on
their stillness and obedience.

st. clare could say but little; he lay with his eyes shut,

flower and strength of his youth! every room and gallery of the house
resounded with sobs and shrieks of despair.

marie, whose nervous system had been enervated by a constant course of
self-indulgence, had nothing to support the terror of the shock, and,
at the time her husband breathed his last, was passing from one fainting
fit to another; and he to whom she had been joined in the mysterious tie
of marriage passed from her forever, without the possibility of even a
parting word.

miss ophelia, with characteristic strength and self-control, had
remained with her kinsman to the last,--all eye, all ear, all attention;
doing everything of the little that could be done, and joining with her
whole soul in the tender and impassioned prayers which the poor slave
had poured forth for the soul of his dying master.

when they were arranging him for his last rest, they found upon his
bosom a small, plain miniature case, opening with a spring. it was the
miniature of a noble and beautiful female

but the funeral passed, with all its pageant of black crape, and
prayers, and solemn faces; and back rolled the cool, muddy waves of
every-day life; and up came the everlasting hard inquiry of â€œwhat is to
be done next?â€

it rose to the mind of marie, as, dressed in loose morning-robes, and
surrounded by anxious servants, she sat up in a great easy-chair, and
inspected samples of crape and bombazine. it rose to miss ophelia, who
began to turn her thoughts towards her northern home. it rose, in silent
terrors, to the minds of the servants, who well knew the unfeeling,
tyrannical character of the mistress in whose hands they were left. all
knew, very well, that the indulgences which had been accorded to them
were not from their mistress, but from their master; and that, now he
was gone, there would be no screen between them and every tyrannous
infliction which a temper soured by affliction might devise.

t a fortnight after the funeral, that miss ophelia, busied

it, and there stood rosa, the pretty young quadroon, whom we have before
often noticed, her hair in disorder, and her eyes swelled with crying.

â€œo, miss feeley,â€ she said, falling on her knees, and catching the skirt
of her dress, â€œ_do, do go_ to miss marie for me! do plead for me! sheâ€™s

â€œwhat have you been doing?â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œyou know, miss feely, iâ€™ve got such a bad temper; itâ€™s very bad of me.
i was trying on miss marieâ€™s dress, and she slapped my face; and i spoke
out before i thought, and was saucy; and she said that sheâ€™d bring
me down, and have me know, once for all, that i wasnâ€™t going to be so
topping as i had been; and she wrote this, and says i shall carry it.
iâ€™d rather sheâ€™d kill me, right out.â€

miss ophelia stood considering, with the paper in her hand.

miss ophelia well knew that it was the universal custom to send women
and young girls to whipping-houses, to the hands of the lowest of
men,--men vile enough to make this their profession,--there to be
subjected to brutal exposure and shameful correction. she had _known_ it
before; but hitherto she had never realized it, till she saw the slender

ignant heart; but, with habitual
prudence and self-control, she mastered herself, and, crushing the paper
firmly in her hand, she merely said to rosa,

â€œsit down, child, while i go to your mistress.â€

â€œshameful! monstrous! outrageous!â€ she said to herself, as she was
crossing the parlor.

she found marie sitting up in her easy-chair, with mammy standing
by her, combing her hair; jane sat on the ground before her, busy in
chafing her feet.

â€œhow do you find yourself, today?â€ said miss ophelia.

a deep sigh, and a closing of the eyes, was the only reply, for a
moment; and then marie answered, â€œo, i donâ€™t know, cousin; i suppose
iâ€™m as well as i ever shall be!â€ and marie wiped her eyes with a cambric
handkerchief, bordered with an inch deep of black.

â€œi came,â€ said miss ophelia, with a short, dry cough, such as commonly
introduces a difficult subject,--â€œi came to speak with you about poor
rosa.â€

marieâ€™s eyes were open wide enough now, and a flush rose to her sallow

â€œbut, cousin, consider that, if you destroy delicacy and a sense of
shame in a young girl, you deprave her very fast.â€

â€œdelicacy!â€ said marie, with a scornful laugh,--â€œa fine word for such
as she! iâ€™ll teach her, with all her airs, that sheâ€™s no better than the
raggedest black wench that walks the streets! sheâ€™ll take no more airs
with me!â€

â€œyou will answer to god for such cruelty!â€ said miss ophelia, with
energy.

â€œcruelty,--iâ€™d like to know what the cruelty is! i wrote orders for only
fifteen lashes, and told him to put them on lightly. iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s no
cruelty there!â€

â€œno cruelty!â€ said miss ophelia. â€œiâ€™m sure any girl might rather be
killed outright!â€

â€œit might seem so to anybody with your feeling; but all these creatures
get used to it; itâ€™s the only way they can be kept in order. once let
them feel that they are to take any airs about delicacy, and all tha

and theyâ€™ll run all over you, just as my servants always have. iâ€™ve
begun now to bring them under; and iâ€™ll have them all to know that
iâ€™ll send one out to be whipped, as soon as another, if they donâ€™t mind
themselves!â€ said marie, looking around her decidedly.

jane hung her head and cowered at this, for she felt as if it was
particularly directed to her. miss ophelia sat for a moment, as if she
had swallowed some explosive mixture, and were ready to burst. then,
recollecting the utter uselessness of contention with such a nature,
she shut her lips resolutely, gathered herself up, and walked out of the
room.

it was hard to go back and tell rosa that she could do nothing for
her; and, shortly after, one of the man-servants came to say that her
mistress had ordered him to take rosa with him to the whipping-house,
whither she was hurried, in spite of her tears

mariner shipwrecked almost in port rises the vision of the church-spire
and loving roofs of his native village, seen over the top of some black
wave only for one last farewell. he drew his arms tightly over his
bosom, and choked back the bitter tears, and tried to pray. the poor old
soul had such a singular, unaccountable prejudice in favor of liberty,
that it was a hard wrench for him; and the more he said, â€œthy will be
done,â€ the worse he felt.

he sought miss ophelia, who, ever since evaâ€™s death, had treated him
with marked and respectful kindness.

â€œmiss feely,â€ he said, â€œmasâ€™r st. clare promised me my freedom. he told
me that he had begun to take it out for me; and now, perhaps, if miss

like goinâ€™ on with it, was it as masâ€™r st. clareâ€™s wish.â€

this incident occurred a few days after that of rosa, while miss ophelia
was busied in preparations to return north.

seriously reflecting within herself, she considered that perhaps she had
shown too hasty a warmth of language in her former interview with marie;
and she resolved that she would now endeavor to moderate her zeal, and
to be as conciliatory as possible. so the good soul gathered herself
up, and, taking her knitting, resolved to go into marieâ€™s room, be as
agreeable as possible, and negotiate tomâ€™s case with all the diplomatic
skill of which she was

displaying before her certain samples of thin black stuffs.

â€œthat will do,â€ said marie, selecting one; â€œonly iâ€™m not sure about its
being properly mourning.â€

â€œlaws, missis,â€ said jane, volubly, â€œmrs. general derbennon wore just

â€œwhat do you think?â€ said marie to miss ophelia.

â€œitâ€™s a matter of custom, i suppose,â€ said miss ophelia. â€œyou can judge
about it better than i.â€

â€œthe fact is,â€ said marie, â€œthat i havenâ€™t a dress in the world that i
can wear; and, as i am going to break up the establishment, and go off,
next week, i must decide upon something.â€

â€œare you going so soon?â€

â€œindeed, i shall do no such thing!â€ said marie, sharply. â€œtom is one of
the most valuable servants on the place,--it couldnâ€™t be afforded, any
way. besides, what does he want of liberty? heâ€™s a great deal better off
as he is.â€

â€œbut he does desire it, very earnestly, and his master promised it,â€
 said miss ophelia.

tried, hundreds of times. itâ€™s no favor to set them free.â€

â€œbut tom is so steady, industrious, and pious.â€

â€œo, you neednâ€™t tell me! iâ€™ve see a hundred like him. heâ€™ll do very
well, as long as heâ€™s taken care of,--thatâ€™s all.â€

â€œbut, then, consider,â€ said miss ophelia, â€œwhen you set him up for sale,
the chances of his getting a bad master.â€

â€œo, thatâ€™s all humbug!â€ said marie; â€œit isnâ€™t one time in a hundred that
a good fellow gets a bad master; most masters are good, for all the talk
that is made. iâ€™ve lived and grown up here, in the south, and i
never yet was acquainted with a master that didnâ€™t treat his servants
well,--quite as well as is worth while. i donâ€™t feel any fears on that
head.â€

and gasped for breath, and called mammy to open the window, and to bring
her the camphor-bottle, and to bathe her head, and unhook her dress.
and, in the general confusion that ensued, miss ophelia made her escape
to her apartment.

she saw, at once, that it would do no good to say anything more; for
marie had an indefinite capacity for hysteric fits; and, after this,
whenever her husbandâ€™s or evaâ€™s wishes with regard to the servants were
alluded to, she always found it convenient to set one in operation.
miss ophelia, therefore, did the next best thing she could for tom,--she
wrote a letter to mrs. shelby for him, stating his troubles, and urging
them to send to his relief.

is it strange that the religious peace and trust, which had upborne him
hitherto, should give way to tossings of soul and despondent darkness?
the gloomiest problem of this mysterious life was constantly before his
eyes,--souls crushed and ruined, evil triumphant, and god silent. it
was weeks and months that tom wrestled, in his own soul, in darkness and
sorrow. he thought of miss opheliaâ€™s letter to his kentucky friends, and
would pray earnestly that god would send him deliverance. and then he
would watch, day after day, in the vague hope of seeing somebody sent
to redeem him; and, when nobody came, he would crush back to his soul
bitter thoughts,--that it was vain to serve god, that god had forgotten
him. he sometimes saw cassy; and sometimes, when summoned to the house,
caught a glimpse of the dejected form of emmeline, but held very little
communion with either; in fact, t

chapter xli

the young master


two days after, a young man drove a light wagon up through the avenue of
china trees, and, throwing the reins hastily on the horseâ€™s neck, sprang
out and inquired for the owner of the place.

it was george shelby; and, to show how he came to be there, we must go
back in our story.

the letter of miss ophelia to mrs. shelby had, by some unfortunate
accident, been detained, for a month or two, at some remote post-office,
before it reached its destination; and, of course, before it was
received, tom was already lost to view among the distant swamps of the
red river.

mrs. shelby read the intelligence with the deepest concern; but
any immediate action upon it was an impossibility. she was then in
attendance on the sick-bed of her husband, who lay delirious in the
crisis of a fever. master george shelby

, who, in the interval, had
changed from a boy to a tall young man, was her constant and faithful
assistant, and her only reliance in superintending his fatherâ€™s affairs.
miss ophelia had taken the precaution to send them the name of the
lawyer who did business for the st. clares; and the most that, in the
emergency, could be done, was to address a letter of inquiry to him.
the sudden death of mr. shelby, a few days after, brought, of course, an
absorbing pressure of other interests, for a season.

mr. shelby showed his confidence in his wifeâ€™s ability, by appointing
her sole executrix upon his estates; and thus immediately a large and
complicated amount of business was br

ought upon her hands.

mrs. shelby, with characteristic energy, applied herself to the work of
straightening the entangled web of affairs; and she and george were
for some time occupied with collecting and examining accounts, selling
property and settling debts; for mrs. shelby was determined that
everything should be brought into tangible and recognizable shape, let
the consequences to her prove what they might. in the mean time, they
received a letter from the lawyer to whom miss ophelia had referred
them, saying that he knew nothing of the matter; that the man was sold
at a public auction, and that, beyond receiving the money, he knew
nothing of the affair.

neither george nor mrs. shelby could be easy at this result; and,
accordingly, some six months after, the latter, having business for his
mother, down the river, resolved to visit new orleans, in person, and
push his inquiries, in hopes of discovering tomâ€™s whereabouts, and
restoring him.

george, with his wife, children, sister and mother, embarked for africa,
some few weeks after. if we are not mistaken, the world will yet hear
from him there.

of our other characters we have nothing very particular to write, except
a word relating to miss ophelia and topsy, and a farewell chapter, which
we shall dedicate to george shelby.

miss ophelia took topsy home to vermont with her, much to the surprise
of the grave deliberative body whom a new englander recognizes under
the term â€œ_our folks_.â€ â€œour folks,â€ at first, thought it an odd and
unnecessary addition to their well-trained domestic establishment; but,
so thoroughly efficient was miss ophelia in her conscientious endeavor
to do her duty by her _Ã©lÃ¨ve_, that the child rapidly grew
