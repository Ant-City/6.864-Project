mr.[CHARACTER] - 
 a prominent and upstanding lawyer, well respected
in the london community. utterson is reserved, dignified, and perhaps
even lacking somewhat in imagination, but he does seem to possess
a furtive curiosity about the more sordid side of life. his rationalism,
however, makes him ill equipped to deal with the supernatural nature
of the jekyll-hyde connection. while not a man of science, utterson
resembles his friend dr. lanyon--and perhaps victorian society at
large--in his devotion to reasonable explanations and his denial
of the supernatural.
