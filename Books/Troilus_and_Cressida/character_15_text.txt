    men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is.
    that she was never yet that ever knew
    love got so sweet as when desire did sue;
    therefore this maxim out of love i teach:
    achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech.

    what grief hath set these jaundies o'er your cheeks?
    the ample proposition that hope makes
    in all designs begun on earth below
    fails in the promis'd largeness; checks and disasters
    grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,
    as knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,
    infects the sound pine, and diverts his grain
    tortive and errant from his course of growth.

 protractive trials of great jove
    to find persistive constancy in men;
    the fineness of which metal is not found
    in fortune's love? for then the bold and coward,
    the wise and fool, the artist and unread,
    the hard and soft, seem all affin'd and kin.
    but in the wind and tempest of her frown
    distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,
    puffing at all, winnows the light away;
    and what hath mass or matter by itself
    lies rich in virtue and unmingled.
  nestor. with due observance of thy godlike seat,
    great agamemnon, nestor shall apply
    thy latest words. in the reproof of chance
    lies the true proof of men. the sea being smooth,
    how many shallow bauble boats dare sail
    upon her patient breast, making their way
    with those of nobler bulk!
    but let the ruffian boreas once enrage
    the gentle thetis, and anon behold
    the strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,
    bounding between the two moist elements

    should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree

    it hath to climb. the general's disdain'd
    by him one step below, he by the next,
    that next by him beneath; so ever step,
    exampl'd by the first pace that is sick
    of his superior, grows to an envious fever
    of pale and bloodless emulation.
    and 'tis this fever that keeps troy on foot,
    not her own sinews. to end a tale of length,
    troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.
  nestor. most wisely hath ulysses here discover'd
    the fever whereof all our power is sick.
  agamemnon. the nature of the sickness found, ulysses,
    what is the remedy?
  ulysses. the great achilles, whom opinion crowns
    the sinew and the forehand of our host,
    having his ear full of his airy fame,
    grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent
    lies mocking our designs; with him patroclus
    upon a lazy bed the livelong day
    breaks scurril jests;
    and with ridiculous a

    'twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage-
    such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming
    he acts thy greatness in; and when he speaks
    'tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquar'd,
    which, from the tongue of roaring typhon dropp'd,
    would seem hyperboles. at this fusty stuff
    the large achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,
    from his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;
    cries 'excellent! 'tis agamemnon just.
    now play me nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,
    as he being drest to some oration.'
    that's done-as near as the extremest ends
    of parallels, as like vulcan and his wife;
    yet god achilles still cries 'excellent!
    'tis nestor right. now play him me, patroclus,
    arming to answer in a night alarm.'
    and then, forsooth, the faint defects of age
    must be the scene of mirth: to cough and spit

    ajax is grown self-will'd and bears his head
    in such a rein, in full as proud a place
    as broad achilles; keeps his tent like him;
    makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war
    bold as an oracle, and sets thersites,

    why, this hath not a finger's dignity:
    they call this bed-work, mapp'ry, closet-war;
    so that the ram that batters down the wall,
    for the great swinge and rudeness of his poise,
    they place before his hand that made the engine,

  ulysses. this 'tis:

    that hath to this maturity blown up
    in rank achilles must or now be cropp'd

    as banks of libya-though, apollo knows,
    'tis dry enough-will with great speed of judgment,
    ay, with celerity, find hector's purpose
    pointing on him.
  ulysses. and wake him to the answer, think you?
  nestor. why, 'tis most meet. who may you else oppose
    that can from hector bring those honours off,
    if not achilles? though 't be a sportful combat,
    yet in this trial much opinion dwells;
    for here the troyans taste our dear'st repute
    with their fin'st palate; and trust to me, ulysses,
    our imputation shall be oddly pois'd
    in this vile action; for the success,
    although particular, shall give a scantling

    and think perchance they'll sell; if not, the lustre
    of the better yet to show shall show the better,
    by showing the worst first. do not consent
    that ever hector and achilles meet;
    for both our honour and our shame in this
    are dogg'd with two strange followers.
  nestor. i see them not with my old eyes. what are they?
  ulysses. what glory our achilles shares from hector,
    were he not proud, we all should wear with him;
    but he already is too insolent;
    and it were better parch in afric sun
    than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,
    should he scape hector fair. if he were foil'd,
    why, then we do our main opinion crush

    we'll dress him up in voices; if he fail,
    yet go we under our opinion still
    that we have better men. but, hit or miss,
    our project's life this shape of sense assumes-
    ajax employ'd plucks down achilles' plumes.
  nestor. now, ulysses, i begin to relish thy advice;
    and i will give a taste thereof forthwith
    to agamemnon. go we to him straight.

  agamemnon. here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,
    anticipating time with starting courage.
    give with thy trumpet a loud note to troy,
    thou dreadful ajax, that the appalled air
    may pierce the head of the great combatant,
    and hale him hither.
  ajax. thou, trumpet, there's my purse.

    he rises on the toe. that spirit of his
    in aspiration lifts him from the earth.
  agamemnon. is this the lady cressid?
  diomedes. even she.
  agamemnon. most dearly welcome to the greeks, sweet lady.
  nestor. our general doth salute you with a kiss.
  ulysses. yet is the kindness but particular;
    'twere better she were kiss'd in general.
  nestor. and very courtly counsel: i'll begin.
    so much for nestor.
  achilles. i'll take that winter from your lips, fair lady.
    achilles bids you welcome.
  menelaus. i had good argument for kissing once.
  patroclus. but that's no argument for kissing now;
    for thus popp'd paris in his hardiment,
    and parted thus you and your argument.

    may i, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?
  cressida. you may.

  ulysses. why then, for venus' sake give me a kiss
    when helen is a maid again, and his.

    to tender objects, but he in heat of action
    is more vindicative than jealous love.

    labouring for destiny, make cruel way
