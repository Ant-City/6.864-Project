back to the latrines behind trenches. 

later, below in the town, i watched the snow falling, 
looking out of the window of the bawdy house, the 
house for officers, where i sat with a friend and two 
glasses drinking a bottle of asti, and, looking out at the 
snow falling slowly and heavily, we knew it was all 
over for that year. up the river the mountains had not 
been taken ; none of the mountains beyond the river had 
been taken. that was all left for next year. my friend 
saw the priest from our mess going by in the street, 
walking carefully in the slush, and pounded on the win- 
dow to attract his attention. the priest looked up. he 
saw us and smiled. my friend motioned for him to 
come in. the priest shook his head and went on. that 
night in the mess after the spaghetti course, which 
every one ate very quickly and seriously, lifting the 
spaghetti on the fork until the loose strands hung clear 
then lowering it into the mouth, or else using a con-

flask down with the forefinger and the wine, c]g ar red, 
tannic and lovely, poured out into the glass held with 
the same hand; after this course, the captain com- 
menced picking on the priest. 

the priest was young and blushed easily and wore a 
uniform like the rest of us but with a cross in dark 
red velvet above the left breast pocket of his gray 
tunic. the captain spoke pidgin italian for my doubt- 
ful benefit, in order that i might understand perfectly, 
that nothing should be lost. 

"priest to-day with girls," the captain said looking at 
the priest and at me. the priest smiled and blushed and 
shook his head. this captain baited him often. 

"not true?" asked the captain. "to-day i see

with girls." 

"no," said the priest. the other officers were 
amused at the baiting. 

"priest not with girls," went on the captain. "priest 
never with girls," he explained to me. he took my 
glass and filled it, looking at my eyes all the time, but 
not losing sight of the priest. 

"priest every night five against one." every one at 
the table laughed. "you understand ? priest every night 
five against one." he made a gesture and laughed 
loudly. the priest accepted it as a joke. 

"the pope wants the austrians to win the war," the 
major said. "he loves franz joseph. that's where 
the money comes from. i am an atheist." 

"did you ever read the 'black pig' ?" asked the lieu- 
tenant. "i will get you a copy. it was that which 
shook my faith."

"it is a filthy and vile book/' said the priest. "you 
do not really like it" 

"it is very valuable/' said the lieutenant. "it tells you 
about those priests. you will like it," h

smiled at the priest and he smiled back across the candle- 
light. "don't you read it," he said. 

"i will get it for you," said the lieutenant. 

"all thinking men are atheists/' the major said. "i 
do not believe in the free masons however." 

"i believe in the free masons," the lieutenant said. 
"it is a noble organization." some one came in and 
as the door opened i could see the snow falling. 

"there will be no more offensive now that the snow 
has come," i said. 

"certainly not," said the major. "you should

leave. you should go to rome, naples, sicily " 

"he should visit amalfi," said the lieutenant "i 
will write you cards to my family in amalfi. they will 
love you like a son." 

"he should go to palermo." 

"he ought to go to capri." 

"i would like you to see abruzzi and visit my family 
at capracotta," said the priest. 

"listen to him talk about the abruzzi. there's more 
snow there than here. he doesn't want to see peasants. 
let him go to centres of culture and civilization." 

"he should have fine girls. i will give you the ad- 
dresses of places in naples. beautiful young girls — ac- 
companied by their mothers. ha ! ha ! ha !" the cap- 
tain spread his hand open, the thumb up and fingers

id the captain. he spread the hand again. 
again the candle-light made its shadows on the wall. 
he started with the upright thumb and named in their 
order the thumb and four fingers, "soto-tenente (the 
thumb), tenente (first finger), capitano (next finger), 
maggiore (next to the little finger), and tenente-colo- 
nello (the little finger). you go away soto-tenente! 
you come back soto-colonello !" they all laughed. the 
captain was having a great success with finger games. 
he looked at the priest and shouted, "every night 
priest five against one !" they all laughed again. 

"you must go on leave at once," the major said. 

"i would like to go with you and show you things," 
the lieutenant said. 

"when you come back bring a phonograph." 

"bring good opera disks." 

"bring caruso." 

"don't bring caruso. he bellows." 

"don't you wish you could bellow like him?" 

"he bellows. i say he bellows !" 

"i would like you to go to abruzzi," the priest said. 
the others were shouting. "there

"good night," i said to the priest. 

"good night," he said.

when i came back to the front we still lived in that 
town. there were many more guns in the country 
around and the spring had come. the fields were green 
and there were small green shoots on the vines, the trees 
along the road had small leaves and a breeze came from 
the sea. i saw the town with the hill and the old castle 
above it in a cup in the hills with the mountains beyond, 
brown mountains with a little green on their slopes. in

"have you any money?" 

"yes." 

"loan me fifty lire." 

i dried my hands and took out my pocket-book from 
the inside of my tunic hanging on the wall. rinaldi 
took the note, folded it without rising from the bed and 
slid it in his breeches pocket. he smiled, "i must make

on miss barkley the impression of a man of sufficient 
wealth. you are my great and good friend and finan- 
cial protector." 

"go to hell," i said. 

that night at the mess i sat next to the priest and he 
was disappointed and suddenly hurt that i had not gone 
to the abruzzi. he had written to his father that i was 
coming and they had made preparations. i myself felt 
as badly as he did and could not understand why i had 
not gone. it was what i had wanted to do and i tried 
to explain how one thing had led to another and finally 
he saw it and understood that i had really wanted to go 
and it was almost all right. i had drunk much wine 
and afterward coffee and strega and i explained,

ou know. he had not had it 
but he understood that i had really wanted to go to the 
abruzzi but had not gone and we were still friends, 
with many tastes alike, but with the difference between 
us. he had always known what i did not know and 
what, when i learned it, i was always able to forget. 
but i did not know that then, although i learned it later. 
in the meantime we were all at the mess, the meal was 
finished, and the argument went on. we two stopped 
talking and the captain shouted, "priest not happy. 
priest not happy without girls." 

"i am happy," said the priest. 

"priest not happy. priest wants austrians to win 
the war," the captain said. the others listened. the 
priest shook his head. 

"no," he said. 

"priest wants us never to attack. don't you want us 
never to attack?" 

"no. if there is a war i suppose we must attack." 

"must attack. shall attack !" 

the priest nodded. 

"leave him alone," the major said. "he's all right." 

"he can't do anything about it anyway,"

sometimes." 

i pressed her hand, "dear catherine." 

"it sounds very funny now — catherine. you don't 
pronounce it very much alike. but you're very nice. 
you're a very good boy." 

"that's what the priest said." 

"yes, you're very good. and you will come and see 
me?" 

"of course." 

"and you don't have to say you love me. that's all 
over for a while." she stood up and put out her hand. 
"good-night." 

i wanted to kiss her. 

"no," she said. "i'm awfully tired." 

"kiss me, though," i said. 

"i'm awfully tired, darling." 

"kiss me." 

"do you want to very much?" 

"yes." 

we kissed and she broke away suddenly. "no. 
good-night, please, darling." we walked to the door

and we would drink the capri and the door locked and 
it hot and only a sheet and the whole night and we 
would both love each other all night in the hot night in 
milan. that was how it ought to be. i would eat 
quickly and go and see catherine barkley. 

they talked too much at the mess and i drank wine 
because to-night we were not all brothers unless i drank 
a little and talked with the priest about archbishop 
ireland who was, it seemed, a noble man and with whose 
injustice, the injustices he had received and in which i 
participated as an american, and of which i had never 
heard, i feigned acquaintance. it would have been im- 
polite not to have known something of them when i had

listened to such a splendid explanation of their causes 
which were, after all, it seemed, misunderstandings. i 
thought he had a fine name and he came from minne-

made it pretty was that it sounded like island. no that 
wasn't it. there was more to it than that. yes, father. 
that is true, father. perhaps, father. no, father. 
well, maybe yes, father. you know more about it than 
i do, father. the priest was good but dull. the officers 
were not good but dull. the king was good but dull. 
the wine was bad but not dull. it took the enamel off 
your teeth and left it on the roof of your mouth. 

"and the priest was locked up," rocca said, "be- 
cause they found the three per cent bonds on his person. 
it was in france of course. here they would never 
have arrested him. he denied all knowledge of the five 
per cent bonds. this took place at beziers. i was there 
and reading of it in the paper, we

to see the priest. it was quite evident he had stolen the 
bonds." 

"i don't believe a word of this," rinaldi said. 

"just as you like," rocca said. "but i am telling it 
for our priest here. it is very informative. he is a 
priest; he will appreciate it." 

the priest smiled. "go on," he said. "i am listen- 
ing." 

"of course some of the bonds were not accounted 
for but the priest had all of the three per cent bonds 
and several local obligations, i forget exactly what they 
were. so i went to the jail, now this is the point of the 
story, and i stood outside his cell and i said as though 
i were going to confession, 'bless me, father, for you 
have sinned/ " 



42 a farewell to arms 

there was great laughter from everybody. 

"and what did he say?" asked the priest. rocca 
ignored this and went on to explain the joke to me. 
"you see the point, don't you?" it seemed i
 
 ___________________________
 
t was a 
very funny joke if you understood it properly. they 
poured me more wine and i told the story about the 
english private soldier who was placed under the show- 
er bath. then the major told the story of the eleven 
czecho-slovaks and the hungarian corporal. after 
some more wine i told the story of the jockey who 
found the penny. the major said there was an italian 
story something like that about the duchess who could 
not sleep at night. at this point the priest left and i 
told the story about the travelling salesman who arrived 
at five o'clock in the morning at marseilles when the 
mistral was blowing. the major said he had heard a 
report that i could drink. i denied this. he said it 
was true and by the corpse of bacchus we would test 
whether it was true or not. not bacchus, i said. not 
bacchus. yes, bacchus, he said. i should drink cup 
for cup and glass for glass with bassi, fillipo vin-

now. he held up the glass. "to your valorous wounds.

all the time in the hot weather don't you get excited ?" 

"sometimes." 

"i can't imagine lying like that. i would go crazy." 

"you are crazy." 

"i wish you were back. no one to come in at night 
from adventures. no one to make fun of. no one to 
lend me money. no blood brother and roommate. 
why do you get yourself wounded?" 

"you can make fun of the priest." 

"that priest. it isn't me that makes fun of him. it 
is the captain. i like him. if you must have a priest 
have that priest. he's coming to see you. he makes 
big preparations." 

"i like him."

it was dusk when the priest came. they had brought 
the soup and afterward taken away the bowls and i was 
lying looking at the rows of beds and out the win- 
dow at the tree-top that moved a little in the evening 
breeze. the breeze came in through the window and it 
was cooler with the evening. the flies were on the ceil- 
ing now and on the electric light bulbs that hung on 
wires. the lights were only turned on when some one 
was brought in at night or when something was being 
done. it made me feel very young to have

put to bed after early supper. the orderly came down 
between the beds and stopped. some one was with him. 
it was the priest. he stood there small, brown-faced, 
and embarrassed. 

"how do you do?" he asked. he put some packages 
down by the bed, on the floor. 

"all right, father." 

he sat down in the chair that had been brought for 
rinaldi and looked out of the window embarrassedly. 
i noticed his face looked very tired. 

"i can only stay a minute," he said. "it is late." 

"it's not late. how is the mess?" 

he smiled. "i am still a great joke," he sounded 
tired too. "thank god they are all well." 

"i am so g

"the others are illustrated," he said. 

"it will be a great happiness to read them. where 
did you get them?" 

"i sent for them to mestre. i will have more." 

"you were very good to come, father. will you 
drink a glass of vermouth?" 

"thank you. you keep it. it's for you." 

"no, drink a glass." 

"all right. i will bring you more then." 

the orderly brought the glasses and opened the bot- 
tle. he broke off the cork and the end had to be shoved 
down into the bottle. i could see the priest was dis- 
appointed but he said, "that's all right. it's no mat- 
ter." 

"here's to your health, father." 

"to your better health." 

afterward he held the glass in his hand and we 
looked at one another. sometimes we talked and were 
good friends but to-night it was difficult. 

"what's the matter, father? you seem very tired." 

"i am tired but i have no right to be." 



a farewell to arms 75 

"it's the heat." 

"no. this is only the spring. i feel very low." 

"you have the war disgust."

"no. but i hate the war." 

"i don't enjoy it," i said. he shook his head and 
looked out of the window. 

"you do not mind it. you do not see it. you must 
forgive me. i know you are wounded." 

"that is an accident." 

"still even wounded you do not see it. i can tell. 
i do not see it myself but i feel it a little." 

"when i was wounded we were talking about it. 
passini was talking." 

the priest put down the glass. he was thinking 
about something else. 

"i know them because i am like they are," he said. 

"you are different though." 

"but really i am like they are." 

"the officers don't see anything." 

"some of them do. some are very delicate and feel 
worse than any of us." 

"they are mostly different." 

"it is not education or money. it is something else. 
even if they had education or money men like passini 
would not wish to be officers. i would not be an 
officer."

end that people sometimes came in by. if any one were 
going to die they put a screen around the bed so you 
could not see them die, but only the shoes and puttees 
of doctors and men nurses showed under the bottom of 
the screen and sometimes at the end there would be 
whispering. then the priest would come out from be-

back behind the screen to come out again carrying the 
one who was dead with a blanket over him down the 
corridor between the beds and some one folded the 
screen and took it away. 

that morning the major in charge of the ward asked 
me if i felt that i could travel the next day. i said i

and the corriere delia sera at the table. there was a 
letter from my grandfather, containing family news,

lars, and a few clippings ; a dull letter from the priest 
at our mess, a letter from a man i knew who was flying 
with the french and had gotten in with a wild gang 
and was telling about it, and a note from rinaldi ask- 
ing me how long i was going to skulk in milano and 
what was all the news? he wanted me to bring him 
phonograph records and enclosed a list. i drank a 
small bottle of chianti with the meal, had a coffee after-

i drank half the glass. in the hall i could hear the 
orderly calling. "soup! soup is ready!" 

the major came in, nodded to us and sat down. he 
seemed very small at table. 

"is this all we are?" he asked. the orderly put the 
soup bowl down and he ladled out a plate full. 

"we are all," rinaldi said. "unless the priest 
comes. if he knew federico was here he would be 
here." 

"where is he?" i asked. 

"he's at 307," the major said. he was busy with 
his soup. he wiped his mouth, wiping his upturned 
gray mustache carefully. "he will come i think. i 
called them and left word to tell him you were here." 

"i miss the noise of the mess," i said. 

"yes, it's quiet," the major said. 

"i will be noisy," said rinaldi. 

"drink some wine, enrico," said the major. he 
filled my glass. the spaghetti came in and we

and compact looking. i stood up and we shook hands. 
he put his hand on my shoulder. 

"i came as soon as i heard," he said. 

"sit down," the major said. "you're late."

"how are you?" he asked me. 

"fine," i said. "how have things been?" 

"drink some wine, priest," rinaldi said. "take a lit- 
tle wine for your stomach's sake. that's saint paul, 
you know." 

"yes i know," said the priest politely. rinaldi filled 
his glass. 

"that saint paul," said rinaldi. "he's the one who 
makes all the trouble." the priest looked at me and 
smiled. i could see that the baiting did not t

"that saint paul," rinaldi said. "he was a rounder 
and a chaser and then when he was no longer hot he 
said it was no good. when he was finished he made 
the rules for us who are still hot. isn't it true, fede- 
rico?" 

the major smiled. we were eating meat stew now. 

"i never discuss a saint after dark," i said. the 
priest looked up from the stew and smiled at me. 

"there he is, gone over with the priest," rinaldi 
said. "where are all the good old priest-baiters? 
where is cavalcanti? where is brundi? where is 
cesare? do i have to bait this priest alone without 
support?" 

"he is a good priest," said the major. 

"he is a good priest," said rinaldi. "but still a 
priest. i try to make the mess like the old days. i want 
to make federico happy. to hell with you, priest!" 

i saw the major look at him and notice that he was 
drunk. his thin face was white. the line of his hair 
was very black against the white of his forehead.

"he's been under a strain and he's tired," the major 
said to me. he finished his meat and wiped up the 
gravy with a piece of bread. 

"i don't give a damn," rinaldi said to the table. "to

the priest shook his head. the orderly took away 
the stew dish. 

"what are you eating meat for?" rinaldi turned 
to the priest. "don' you know it's friday?" 

"it's thursday," the priest said.

that's what you're eating." 

"the white meat is from officers," i said, completing 
the old joke. 

rinaldi laughed. he filled his glass. 

"don't mind me," he said. "i'm just a little crazy."

"you want to talk to the priest. i have to go in the 
town," rinaldi said. "good-night, priest." 

"good-night, rinaldo," the priest said. 

"i'll see you fredi," rinaldi said. 

"yes," i said. "come in early." he made a face and 
went out the door. the major was standing with us. 
"he's very tired and overworked," he said. "he thinks 
too he has syphilis. i don't believe it but he may have.

he is treating himself for it. good-night. you will 
leave before daylight, enrico ?" 

"yes." 

"good-by then," he said. "good luck. peduzzi will 
wake you and go with you." 

"good-by, signor maggiore."

'til call regularly." 

"please do. good-night. don't let rinaldi drink so 
much brandy." 

"i'll try not to." 

"good-night, priest." 

"good-night, signor maggiore." 

he went off into his office.

i went to the door and looked out. it had stopped 
raining but there was a mist. 

"should we go upstairs ?" i asked the priest. 

"i can only stay a little while." 

"come on up." 

we climbed the stairs and went into my room. i lay 
down on rinaldi's bed. the priest sat on my cot that 
the orderly had set up. it was dark in the room. 

"well," he said, "how are you really?" 

"i'm all right. i'm tired to-nigh

"i'm tired too, but from no cause." 

"what about the war?" 

"i think it will be over soon. i don't know why, but 
i feel it." 

"how do you feel it?" 

"you know how your major is? gentle? many 
people are like that now." 

"i feel that way myself," i said. 

"it has been a terrible summer," said the priest. he 
was surer of himself now than when i had gone away. 
"you cannot believe how it has been. except that you 
have been there and you know how it can be. many 
people have realized the war this summer. officers 
whom i thought could never realize it realize it now." 

"what will happen?" i stroked the blanket with my 
hand. 

"i do not know but i do not think it can go on much 
longer." 

"what will happen?" 

"they will stop fighting."

through the pockets and took the papers of the people 
they shot. they would not have my papers. they might

syphilis. it was not a serious disease anyway if you 
took it in time, they said. but he would worry. i 
would worry too if i had it. any one would worry.

"i have a lovely life. but i was afraid because i'm 
big now that maybe i was a bore to you." 

"oh, cat. you don't know how crazy i am about 
you." 

"this way?" 

"just the way you are. i have a fine time. don't we 
have a good life?" 

"i do, but i thought maybe you were restless." 

"no. sometimes i wonder about the front and 
about people i know but i don't worry. i don't think 
about anything much." 

"who do you wonder about?" 

"about rinaldi and the priest and lots of people i 
know. but i don't think about them much. i don't 
want to think about the war. i'm through with it." 

"what are you thinking about now?" 

"nothing." 

"yes you were. tell me." 

"i was wondering whether rinaldi had the syphilis." 

"was that all?" 

"yes." 

"has he the syphilis?" 

"i don't know." 

"i'm glad you haven't. did you ever have anything 
like that?" 

"i had gonorrhea." 

"i don't want to hear about it. was it very painful,

"very."

"you're all right, cat," i said. "you're going to be 
all right." 

"i'm going to die," she said; then waited and said, 
"i hate it." 

i took her hand. 

"don't touch me," she said. i let go of her hand. 
she smiled. "poor darling. you touch me all you 
want." 

"you'll be all right, cat. i know you'll be all right." 

"i meant to write you a letter to have if anything 
happened, but i didn't do it."

"do you want me to get a priest or any one to come 
and see you?" 

"just you," she said. then a little later, "i'm not 
afraid. i just hate it." 

"you must not talk so much," the doctor said. 

"all right," catherine said. 

"do you want me to do anything, cat? can i get 
you anything?" 

catherine smiled, "no." then a little later, "you 
won't do our things with another girl, or say the same 
things, will you?" 

"never." 

"i want you to have girls, though." 

"i don't want them." 

"you are talking too much," the doctor
