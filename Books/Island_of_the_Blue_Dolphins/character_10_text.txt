he dunes to the edge of the cliff and stood there while the sun rose.
the wind grew cold, but fearing that those on the ship would see the smoke we did not start a fire, though we had meal to
cook for breakfast. instead we ate a small quantity of dried abalone, and afterwards my brother ramo climbed over the cliff.
no one had been down to the rocks since the canoes were hidden so we did not know whether they were still safe or not.
while he was gone we saw a man running across the dunes. it was nanko, carrying a message from matasaip. he was
swearing in spite, of the cold and he stood trying to catch his breath. we all waited, urging him to talk, but his face was happy
and we knew that he brought good news.
'speak!' everyone said in a chorus.
'i have been running for more than a league,' he said. ‘i cannot talk.'
'you are talking,' someone said.
'speak, nanko, speak,' cried many voices.
nanko was having fun with us. he threw out his chest and took a deep breath. he looked around at the ci

'the ship,' he said at last, saying the words slowly, ‘does not belong to our enemies, the aleuts. there are white men on this
ship and they have come from that place where kimki went when he left our island.'
'has kimki returned?' an old man broke in.
'no, but it is he who saw the white men and told them to come here.'
'what do they look like !' ulape asked.
'are there boys on the ship?' asked ramo, who had come back with his mouth full of something.
everyone seemed to be talking at once.
nanko made his face stern, which was hard for him to do because his mouth had been cut in the battle with the aleuts and
ever since it had always seemed to smile. he held up his hand for silence. 'the ship has come for one reason,' he said. 'to
take us away from ghalas-at.'
'to what place?’ i asked.
it was good news that the ship did not belong to the aleuts. but where would the white men take us !
'i do not know to what place,' he said. 'kimki knows and he has asked the white men to take us there.

saying no more, nanko turned back and we followed him. we were fearful of where we were going, yet we were happy, too.

we took nothing with us when we thought we would have to see, so there was much excitement as we packed our baskets.
nanko strode up and down outside the houses, urging us to hurry.
'the wind grows strong,' he shouted. ‘the ship will leave you.'
i filled two baskets with the things i wished to take. three fine needles of whalebone, an awl for making holes, a good stone
knife for scraping hides, two cooking pots, and a small box made from a shell with many ear-rings in it.
ulape had two boxes of ear-rings, for she was vainer than i, and when she put them into her baskets, she drew a thin mark
with blue clay across

 her nose and cheekbones. the mark meant that she was unmarried.
'the ship leaves,' shouted nanko.
'if it goes,' ulape shouted back, ‘it will come again after the storm.'
my sister was in love with nanko; but she laughed at him.
'other men will come to the island,' she said. 'they will be far more handsome and brave than those who leave.'
'you are all women of such ugliness that they will be afraid and soon go away.
the wind blew in fierce gusts as we left the village, stinging our faces with sand. ramo hopped along far in front with one of
our baskets, but before long he ran hack to say that he had forgotten his fishing spear. nanko was standing on the cliff
motioning us to hurry, so i refused

 to let him go back for it.
the ship was anchored outside the cove and nanko said that it could not come closer to the shore because of the high waves.
they were beating against the rocks with the sound of thunder. the shore as far as i could see was rimmed with foam.
two boats were pulled up on the beach. beside them stood four white men and as we came down the trail, one of the men
beckoned us to walk faster. he spoke to us in a language which we could not understand.
the men of our tribe, except nanko and chief matasaip, were already on the ship. my brother ramo was

there too, nanko
said. he had run on ahead after i had told him that he could not go back to the village for his spear. nanko said that he had
jumped into the first boat that left the cove. 
matasaip divided the women into two groups. then the boats were pushed into the water, and while they bobbed about we
scrambled into them as best we could.
the cove was partly sheltered from the wind, but as soon as we went through the passage between the rocks and into the sea,
great waves struck us. there was much confusion. spray hew, the white men shouted at each other. the boat pitched so
wildly that in one breath you could s

n, for he began to shout orders which they quickly
obeyed. sails rose on the tall masts and two of the men began to pull on the rope that held the anchor.
i called to my brother, knowing that he was very curious and therefore would be in the way of the men who were working.
the wind drowned my voice and he did not answer. the deck was so crowded that it was hard to move, but i went from one
end of it to the other, calling his name. still there was no answer. no one had seen him.
at last i found nanko.
i was overcome with fear. ‘where is my brother?' i cried.
he repeated what he had told me on the beach, but as he spoke ulape who stood beside him pointed towards the island. i
looked out across the deck and the sea. there, running along the cliff, the fishing spear held over his head, was ramo.
the sails had filled and the ship was now moving slowly away. everyone was looking towards the cliff, even the white men. i
ran to one of them and pointed, but he shook his head and turned from me. t
