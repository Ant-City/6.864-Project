s uninhabited.
no smoke came from the chimney, and the little lattice windows gaped
forlorn. then, like all dreamers, i was possessed of a sudden with
supernatural powers and passed like a spirit through the barrier before
me. the drive wound away in front of me, twisting and turning as it had
always done, but as i advanced i was aware that a change had come upon
it; it was narrow and unkempt, not the drive that we had known. at first
i was puzzled and did not understand, and it was only when i bent my head
to avoid the low swinging branch of a tree that i realized what had happened.
nature had come into her own again and, little by little, in her stealthy,
insidious way had encroached upon the drive with long, tenacious fingers.
the woods, always a menace even in the past, had triumphed in the end.
they crowded, dark and uncontrolled, to the borders of the drive. the
beeches with white, naked limbs leant close to one another, their branches
intermingled in a strange embrace, making a vau

ws. scattered here and again amongst this jungle growth i would
recognize shrubs that had been landmarks in our time, things of culture
and grace, hydrangeas whose blue heads had been famous. no hand had checked 
their progress, and they had gone native now, rearing to monster height
without a bloom, black and ugly as the nameless parasites that grew beside
them.

our drive. sometimes i thought it lost, but it appeared again, beneath
a fallen tree perhaps, or struggling on the other side of a muddied ditch
created by the winter rains. i had not thought the way so long. surely
the miles had multiplied, even as the trees had done, and this path led
but to a labyrinth, some choked wilderness, and not to the house at all.
i came upon it suddenly; the approach masked by the unnatural growth of
a vast shrub that spread in all directions, and i stood, my heart thumping
in my breast, the strange prick of tears behind my eyes.

t clung about their roots
as though conscious of their spurious origin. a lilac had mated with a
copper beech, and to bind them yet more closely to one another the
malevolent ivy, always an enemy to grace, had thrown her tendrils about
the pair and made them prisoners. ivy held prior place in this lost garden,
the long strands crept across the lawns, and soon would encroach upon
the house itself. there was another plant too, some half-breed from the
woods, whose seed had been scattered long ago beneath the trees and then
forgotten, and now, marching in unison with the ivy, thrust its ugly form
like a giant rhubarb towards the soft grass where the daffodils had blown.
nettles were everywhere, the vanguard of the army. they choked the terrace,
they sprawled about the paths, they leant, vulgar and lanky, against the
very windows of the house. they made indifferent sentinels, for in many
places their ranks had been broken by the rhubarb plant, and they lay
with crumpled heads and listless ste
