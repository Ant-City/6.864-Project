[CHARACTER] - 
      the proud, hard queen of judaea, [CHARACTER] abhors jokanaan, who has slandered her as an incestuous harlot and remains alive against her wishes. she also suffers the indignity of herod's incestuous lust for salome, hopelessly reproaching him for his gaze. unlike most of the cast, characterized by its propensity for finding symbolism and the omen in particular in the world, [CHARACTER] appears to scorn the symbol. thus, for example, when herod sees a madwoman in the moon, she can only scoff: "the moon is like the moon, that is all". according to jokanaan, [CHARACTER] is also guilty of a crime of sight, having "seen the images of chaldeans limned in colors" and given herself up "unto the lust of her eyes".
