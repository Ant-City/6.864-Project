verona. a public place.

enter sampson and gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house
of capulet.


  samp. gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.

  greg. no, for then we should be colliers.

  samp. i mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.

  greg. ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.

  samp. i strike quickly, being moved.

  greg. but thou art not quickly moved to strike.

  samp. a dog of the house of montague moves me.

  greg. to move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.
    therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.

  samp. a dog of that house shall move me to stand. i will take
    the wall of any man or maid of montague's.

  greg. that shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the
    wall.

  samp. 'tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
    are ever thrust to the wall. therefore i will push montague's men
    from the wall and thrust his maid

men, i will be cruel with the maids- i will cut off
    their heads.

  greg. the heads of the maids?

  samp. ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
    take it in what sense thou wilt.

  greg. they must take it in sense that feel it.

  samp. me they shall feel while i am able to stand; and 'tis known i
    am a pretty piece of flesh.

  greg. 'tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst
    been poor-john. draw thy tool! here comes two of the house of
    montagues.

           enter two other servingmen [abram and balthasar].


  samp. my naked weapon is out. quarrel! i will back thee.

  greg. how? turn thy back and run?

  samp. fear me not.

  greg. no, marry. i fear thee!

  samp. let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.

  greg. i will frown as i pass by, and let them take it as they list.

  samp. nay, as they dare. i will bite my thumb at them; which is
    disgrace to them, if they bear it.

  tyb. what, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
    turn thee benvolio! look upon thy death.

  ben. i do but keep the peace. put up thy sword,
    or manage it to part these men with me.

    as i hate hell, all montagues, and thee.

   throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
    and hear the sentence of your moved prince.
    three civil brawls, bred of an airy word
    by thee, old capulet, and montague,
    have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets
    and made verona's ancient citizens
    cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
    to wield old partisans, in hands as old,
    cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.
    if ever you disturb our streets again,
    your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
    for this time all the rest depart away.
    you, capulet, shall go along with me;
    and, montague, come you this afternoon,
    to know our farther pleasur

  mon. who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?

  ben. here were the servants of your adversary
    and yours, close fighting ere i did approach.
    i drew to part them. in the instant came
    the fiery tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
    which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
    he swung about his head and cut the winds,
    who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.

 unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes
    of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
    when he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
    and sails upon the bosom of the air.

  jul. o romeo, romeo! wherefore art thou romeo?
    deny thy father and refuse thy name!
    or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
    and i'll no longer be a capulet.

  rom. [aside] shall i hear more, or shall i speak at this?

  jul. 'tis but thy name that is my enemy.
    thou art thyself, though not a montague.
    what's montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
    nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
    belonging to a man. o, be some other name!
    what's in a name? that which we call a rose
    by any other name would smell as sweet.
    so romeo would, were he not romeo call'd,
    retain that dear perfection which he owes
    without that title. romeo, doff thy name;
    and for that name, which is no part of thee,
    take all myself.

  rom. i take thee at thy word.

    henceforth i never will be romeo.

  jul. what man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,
    so stumblest on my counsel?

  rom. by a name
    i know not how to tell thee who i am.
    my name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
    because it is an enemy to thee.
    had i it written, i would tear the word.

  jul. my ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
    of that tongue's utterance, yet i know the sound.
    art thou not romeo, and a montague?

  rom. neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

  jul. how cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
    the orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
    and the place death, considering who thou art,
    if any of my kinsmen find thee here.

  rom. with love's light wings did i o'erperch these walls;
    for stony limits cannot hold love out,
    and what love can do, that dares love attempt.
    therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.

    dost thou love me, i know thou wilt say 'ay';
    and i will take thy word. yet, if thou swear'st,
    thou mayst prove false. at lovers' perjuries,
    they say jove laughs. o gentle romeo,
    if thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
    or if thou thinkest i am too quickly won,
    i'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
    so thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
    in truth, fair montague, i am too fond,
    and therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;
    but trust me, gentleman, i'll prove more true
    than those that have more cunning to be strange.
    i should have been more strange, i must confess,
    but that thou overheard'st, ere i was ware,
    my true-love passion. therefore pardon me,
    and not impute this yielding to light love,
    which the dark night hath so discovered.

    and yet i wish but for the thing i have.
    my bounty is as boundless as the sea,
    my love as deep; the more i give to thee,
    the more i have, for both are infinite.
    i hear some noise within. dear love, adieu!

    an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life
    of stout mercutio, and then tybalt fled;
    but by-and-by comes back to romeo,
    who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
    and to't they go like lightning; for, ere i
    could draw to part them, was stout tybalt slain;

    romeo slew tybalt; romeo must not live.
