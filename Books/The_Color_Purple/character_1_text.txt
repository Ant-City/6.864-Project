wife. she ain't smart either, and i'll just be fair, you have to watch her or she'll give away everything you own. but she can
work like a man.

mr. say how old she is?

he say. she near twenty. and another thing— she tell lies.

it took him the whole spring, from march to june, to make up his mind to take me. all i thought about was nettie. how
she could come to me if i marry him and he be so love struck with her i could figure out a way for us to run away. us both
be hitting nettie's schoolbooks pretty hard, cause us know we got to be smart to git away. i know i'm not as pretty or as
smart as nettie, but she say i ain't dumb.

the way you know who discover america, nettie say, is think bout cucumbers. that what columbus sound like. i learned
all about columbus in first grade, but look like he the first thing i forgot. she say columbus come here in boats call the
neater, the peter, and the santomareater. indians so nice to him he force a bunch of 'em back home with him to wait on
the queen.

but it hard to think with gitting married to mr. hanging over my head.

i feel bad sometime nettie done pass me in learnin. but look like nothing she say can git in my brain and stay. she try to
tell me something bout the ground not being flat. i just say. yeah, like i know it. i never tell her how flat it look to me.

mr. come finally one day looking all drug out.

didn't want nothing to be able to go against that. but what was good tween us must have been nothing but bodies, she

i don't know nothing, i think. and glad of it.


dear god,


now that i know albert hiding nettie's letters, i know exactly where they is. they in his trunk. everything that mean
something to albert go in his trunk. he keep it locked up tight, but shug can git the key.

one night when mr. and grady gone, us open the trunk. us find a lot of shug's underclothes, some nasty picture

postcards, and way down under his tobacco, nettie's letters. bunches and bunches of them. some f

corner of the trunk much, she say.

i heated the stove, put on the kettle. us steam and steam the envelopes until we had all the letters laying on the table.
then us put the envelopes back inside the trunk.

i'm gonna put them in some kind of order for you, say shug.

yeah, i say, but don't let's do it in here, let's go in you and grady room.

so she got up and us went into they little room. shug sat in a chair by the bed with all nettie letters spread round her, i
got on the bed with the pillows behind my back.

these the first ones, say shug. they postmark right here.


dear celie, the first letter say,


you've got to fight and get away from albert. he ain't no good.

when i left you all's house, walking, he followed me on his horse. when we was well out of sight of the house he caught
up with me and started trying to talk. you know how he do. you sure is looking fine. miss nettie, and stuff like that. i tried
to ignore him

.

well, i started to fight him, and with god's help, i hurt him bad enough to make him let me alone. but he was some mad.
he said because of what i'd done i'd never hear from you again, and you would never hear from me.

i was so mad myself i was shaking.

anyhow, i got a ride into town on somebody's wagon. and that same somebody pointed me in the direction of the

reverend mr. 's place. and what was my surprise when a little girl opened the door and she had your eyes set in

your face.

the lady you met in town is name corrine. the little girl's name is olivia. the husband's name is samuel. the little boy's

next one say,


dear celie,


by now i am almost crazy. i think albert told me the truth, and that he is not giving you my letters. the only person i can
think of who could help us out is pa, but i don't want him to know where i am.

i asked samuel if he would visit you and mr. , just to see how you are. but he says he can't risk putting himself

between man and wife, especially when he don't know them. and i felt bad for having to ask him, he and corrine have
been so nice to me. but my heart

i dread parting from them because in the short time we've been together they've been like family to me. like family

next one, fat, dated two months later, say,


dear celie,


i wrote a letter to you almost every day on the ship coming to africa. but by the time we docked i was so down, i tore
them into little pieces and dropped them into the water. albert is not going to let you have my letters and so what use is
there in writing them. that's the way i felt when i tore them up and sent them to you on the waves. but now i feel
different.

i remember one time you said your life made you feel so ashamed you

although i work for corrine and samuel and look after the children, i don't feel like a maid. i guess this is because they

we have. we are not white. we are not europeans. we are black like the africans themselves. and that we and the

dear celie,


samuel is a big man. he dresses in black almost all the time, except for his white clerical collar. and he is black. until you
see his eyes you think he's somber, even mean, but he has the most thoughtful and gentle brown eyes. when he says
something it settles you, because he never says anything off the top of his head and he's never out to dampen your spirit
or to hurt. corrine is a lucky woman to have him as her husband.

it was the funniest thing to stop over in monrovia after my first glimpse of africa, which was senegal. the capital of
senegal is dakar and the people speak their own language, senegalese i guess they would call it, and french. they are the
blackest people i have ever seen, celie. they are black like the people we are talking about when we say, "so and so is
blacker than black, he's blue black." they are so black, celie, they shine. which is something else folks down home lik

but—

did i mention my first sight of the african coast? something struck in me, in my soul, celie, like a large bell, and i just
vibrated. corrine and samuel felt the same. and we kneeled down right on deck and gave thanks to god for letting us see
the land for which our mothers and fathers cried— and lived and died— to see again.

oh, celie! will i ever be able to tell you all?

i dare not ask, i know. but leave it all to god.


your everloving sister, nettie


dear god,


what with being shock, crying and blowing my nose, and trying to puzzle out words us don't know, it took a long time to

read just the first two or three letters. by the time us got up to where she good and settled in africa, mr. and grady

come home.

can you handle it? ast shug.

how i'm gon keep from killing him, i say.

don't kill, she say. nettie be coming home before long. don't make her have to look at you like us look at sofia.

but it so hard, i say, while shug empty her

suitcase and put the letters inside.

hard to be christ too, say shug. but he manage. remember that. thou shalt not kill, he said. and probably wanted to add
on to that. starting with me. he knowed the fools he was dealing with.

but mr. not christ. i'm not christ, i say.

you somebody to nettie, she say. and she be pissed if you change on her while she on her way home.

us hear grady and mr. in the kitchen. dishes rattling, safe door open and shut.

naw, i think i feel better if i kill him, i say. i feels sickish. numb, now.

naw you won't. nobody feel better for killing nothing. they feel something is all.

that better than nothing.

celie, she say, nettie not the only one you got to worry bout.

say what, i ast.

me, celie, think about me a little bit. miss celie, if you kill albert

well, you know how they is, say shug.

what us gon make 'em out of, i say.

we have to git our hands on somebody's army uniform, say shug. for practice. that good strong material and free.

she don't say nothing else, just come over to me and hug.


dear god,


now i know nettie alive i begin to strut a little bit.

think, when she come home us leave here. her and me and our two children. what they look like, i wonder. but it hard
to think bout them. i feels shame. more than love, to tell the truth. anyway, is they all right here? got good sense and all?

dear celie,

we were met at the ship by an african from the village we are settling in. his christian name is joseph. he is short and fat,
with hands that seem not to have any bones in them. when he shook my hand it felt like something soft and damp was
falling and i almost caught it. he speaks a little english, what they call p

 bowed down.

the white missionary before you would not let us have this ceremony, said joseph. but the olinka like it very much. we
know a roofleaf is not jesus christ, but in its own humble way, is it not god?

so there we sat, celie, face to face with the olinka god. and celie, i was so tired and sleepy and full of chicken and
groundnut stew, my ears ringing with song, that all that joseph said made perfect sense to me.

i wonder what you will make of all this?


send my love.


your sister, nettie



dear celie,


it has been a long time since i had time to write. but always, no matter what i'm doing, i am writing to you. dear celie, i
say in my head in the middle of vespers, the middle of the night, while cooking. dear, dear celie. and i imagine that you
really do get my letters and that you are writing me back: dear nettie, this is what life is like for me.

we are up at five o'clock for a light breakfast of millet porridge and fruit, and the morning classes. we teach the children

why do they say i will be a wife of the chief? asks olivia.

that is as high as they can think, i tell her.

fie is fat and shiny with huge perfect teeth. she thinks she has nightmares about him.

you will grow up to be a strong christian woman, i tell her. someone who helps her people to advance. you will be a
teacher or a nurse. you will travel. you will know many people greater than the chief.

will tashi? she wants to know.

yes, i tell her, tashi too.

corrine said to me this morning, nettie, to stop any kind of confusion in the minds of these people, i think we should call
one another brother and sister, all the time. some of them can't seem to get it through their thick skulls that you are not
samuel's other wife. i don't like it, she said.

almost since the day we arrived i've noticed a change in corrine. she isn't sick. she works as hard as ever. she is still
sweet and good-natured. but sometimes i sense her spirit is being tested and that something in her is not at rest.

's fine, i said. i'm glad you brought it up.

and don't let the children call you mama nettie, she said, even in play.

this bothered me a little, but i didn't say anything. the children do call me mama nettie sometimes because i do a good
bit of fussing over them. but i never try to take corrine's place.


and another thing, she said. i think we ought to try not to borrow each other's clothes.

well, she never borrowed anything of mine because i don't have much. but i'm all the time borrowing something of hers.
you feeling yourself? i asked her.

she said yes.

i wish you could see my hut, celie. i love it. unlike our school, which is square, and unlike our church, which doesn't have
walls— at lea

maybe one day i'll put them up, but once, when i held them up to my fabric and mat covered walls they made me feel
very small and unhappy, so i took them down. even the picture of christ which generally looks good anywhere looks
peculiar here. we of course have all of these pictures hung in the school and many of christ behind the altar at the
church. that is enough, i think, though samuel and corrine have pictures and relics (crosses) in their hut as well.

your sister, nettie


dear celie,


tashi's mother and father were just here. they are upset because she spends so much time with olivia. she is changing,
becoming quiet and too thoughtful, they say. she is becoming someone else; her face is beginning to show the spirit of
one of her aunts who was sold to the trader because she no longer fit into village life. this aunt refused to marry the man
chosen for her. refused to bow to the chief. did nothing but lay up, crack cola nuts between her teeth and giggle.

they

 really enter her soul.

the mother seemed puzzled and afraid.

the father, angry.

i thought: aha. tashi knows she is learning a way of life she will never live. but i did not say this.

the world is changing, i said. it is no longer a world just for boys and men.

our women are respected here, said the father. we would never let them tramp the world as american women do. there
is always someone to look after the olinka woman. a father. an uncle. a brother or nephew. do not be offended. sister
nettie, but our people pity women such as you who are cast out, we know not from where, into a world unknown to you,
where you must struggle all alone, for yourself.

so i am an object of pity and contempt, i thought, to men and women alike.

furthermore, said tashi's father, we are not simpletons. we understand that there are places in the world where women
live differently from the way our women do, but we do not approve of this different way for our children.

but life is changing, even in olinka, 
 
 ___________________________
 
an i say to this? again, it is our own behavior around pa.

next time tashi appears at your gate, you will send her straight home, her father said. then he smiled. your olivia can
visit her, and learn what women are for.

i smiled also. olivia must learn to take her education about life where she can find it, i thought. his offer will make a
splendid opportunity.

good-bye until the next time, dear celie, from a pitiful, castout woman who may perish during the rainy season.

your loving sister, nettie


dear celie,


at first there was the faintest sound of movement in the forest. a kind of low humming. then there was chopping and the
sound of dragging. then a scent, some days, of smoke. but now, after two months, during which i or the children or
corrine has been sick, all we hear is chopping and scraping and dragging. and every day we smell smoke.

today one of the boys in my afternoon class burst out, as he entered. the road approaches! the road approaches! he had

merry christmas to you and yours, dear celie. we celebrate it here on the "dark" continent with prayer and song and a
large picnic complete with watermelon, fresh fruit punch, and barbecue!

god bless you,

dearest celie,


i meant to write you in time for easter, but it was not a good time for me and i did not want to burden you with any
distressing news. so a whole year has gone by. the first thing i should tell you about is the road. the road finally reached
the cassava fields about nine months ago and the olinka, who love nothing better than a celebration, outdid themselves
preparing a feast for the roadbuilders who talked and laughed and cut their eyes at the olinka women the whole day. in

meanwhile, corrine has been very ill with african fever. many missionaries in the past have died from it.

but the children are fine. the boys now accept olivia and tashi in class and more mothers are sending their daughters to
school. the men do not like it: who wants a wife who knows everything her husband knows? they fume. but the women
have their ways, and they love their children, even their girls.

i will write more when things start looking up. i trust god they will.


your sister, nettie


dearest celie,


this whole year, after easter, has been difficult. since corrine's illness, all her work has fallen on me, and i must nurse her
as well, which she resents.

one day when i was changing her as she lay in bed, she gave me a long, mean, but somehow pitiful look. why do my
children look like you? she asked.

do you really think they look so much like me? i said.

you could have spit them out, she said.

maybe just living together, loving people makes them look like you, i said. y

i met samuel the same day i met you, corrine, i said. (i still haven't got the hang of saying "sister" all the time.) as god is
my witness, that's the truth.

bring the bible, she said.

i brought the bible, and placed my hand on it, and swore.

you've never known me to lie, corrine, i said. please believe i am not lying now.

then she called samuel, and made him swear that the day she met me was the day he met me also.

he said: i apologize for this. sister nettie, please forgive us.

as soon as samuel left the room she made me raise my dress and she sat up in her sickbed to examine my stomach.

i felt so sorry for her, and so humiliated, celie. and the way she treats the children is the hardest part. she doesn't want
them near her, which they don't understand. how could they? they don't even know they were adopted.

the village is due to be planted in rubber trees this coming season. the olinka hunting territory has already been
destroyed, and the men m

your sister, nettie


dear celie,


guess what? samuel thought the children were mine too! that is why he urged me to come to africa with them. when i
showed up at their house he thought i was following my children, and, soft-hearted as he is, didn't have the heart to turn
me away.

if they are not yours, he said, whose are they?

but i had some questions for him, first.

where did you get them? i asked. and celie, he told me a story that made my hair stand on end. i hope you, poor thing,
are ready for it.

christian charity. corrine had asked me once whether i was running away from home. but i explained i was a big girl now,
my family back home very large and poor, and it was time for me to get out and earn my own living.

tears had soaked my blouse when samuel finished telling me all this. i couldn't begin, then, to tell him the truth. but
celie, i can tell you. and i pray with all my heart that you will get this letter, if none of the others.

floppy easter hats that match too, cept her roses red, mine yellow, and us clam in the packard

g is, like even though the ground everywhere else not warmed up good. pa's land is
warm and ready to go. then all along the road there's easter lilies and jonquils and daffodils and all kinds of little early
wildflowers. then us notice all the birds singing they little cans off, all up and down the hedge, that itself is putting out
little yellow flowers smell like virginia creeper. it all so different from the rest of the country us drive through, it make us
real quiet. i know this sound funny, nettie, but even the sun seemed to stand a little longer over our heads.

well, say shug, all this is pretty enough. you never said how pretty it was.

it wasn't this pretty, i say. every easter time it used to flood, and all us children had colds. anyhow, i say, us stuck close to
the house, and it sure ain't so hot.

that ain't so hot? she ast, as we swung up a long curving hill i didn't remember, right up to a big yellow two story house
with green shutters and a steep green shingle roof.

i laughed.

why, say shug, you don't look more than fifteen.

i ain't, say daisy.

i'm surprise your people let you marry.

i'm her people now, he say.

daisy look at me with pity all over her face. it just like him to keep that from you, she say. he told me how he brought up

dear celie,


i woke up this morning bound to tell corrine and samuel everything. i went over to their hut and pulled up a stool next to
corrine's bed. she's so weak by now that all she can do is look unfriendly— and i could tell i wasn't welcome.

i said, corrine, i'm here to tell you and samuel the truth.

she said, samuel already told me. if the children yours, why didn't you just say so?

samuel said. now, honey.

she said. don't now honey me. nettie swore on the bible to tell me the truth. to tell god the truth, and she lied.

corrine, i said, i didn't lie. i sort of turned my back more on samuel and whispered: you saw my stomach, i said.

what do i know about pregnancy, she said. i never experienced it myself. for all i know, women may be able to rub out all
the signs.

they can't rub out stretch marks, i said. stretch marks go right into the skin, and a woman's stomach stretches enough so
that it keeps a little pot, like all the women ha

she turned her face to the wall.

corrine, i said, i'm the children's aunt. their mother is my older sister, celie.

then i told them the whole story. only corrine was still not convinced.

you and samuel telling so many lies, who can believe anything you say? she asked.

you've got to believe nettie, said samuel. though the part about you and pa was a real shock to him.

then i remembered what you told me about seeing corrine and samuel and olivia in town, when she was buying cloth to
make her and olivia dresses, and how you sent me to her because she was the only woman you'd ever seen with money. i
tried to make corrine remember that day, but she couldn't.

she gets weaker and weaker, and unless she can believe us and start to feel something for her children, i fear we will lose
her.

dearest celie,


every day for the past week i've been trying to get corrine to remember meeting you in town. i know if she can just recall
your face, she will believe olivia (if not adam) is your child. they think olivia looks like me, but that is only because i look
like you. olivia has your face and eyes, exactly. it amazes me that corrine didn't see the resemblance.

remember the main street of town? i asked. remember the hitching post in front of finley's dry goods store? remember

she began to cry in earnest. me and samuel holding her hands.

don't cry. don't cry, i said. my sister was glad to see olivia with you. glad to see her alive. she thought both her children
were dead.

poor thing! said samuel. and we sat there talking a little and holding on to each other until corrine fell off to sleep.

but, celie, in the middle of the night she woke up, turned to samuel and said: i believe. and died anyway.

your sister in sorrow, nettie


dearest celie,


just when i think i've learned to live with the heat, the constant dampness, even steaminess of my clothes, the
swampiness under my arms and between my legs, my friend comes. and cramps and aches and pains— but i must still
keep going as if nothing is happening, or be an embarrassment to samuel, the children and myself. not to mention the
villagers, who think women who have their friends should not even be seen.

right after her mother's death, olivia got her friend; she an

burns aplenty. i have never been able to bring myself to wear one of these dresses, which all seem to have been made
with giants in mind, so i was glad to have corrine's things. at the same time, i dreaded putting them on. i remembered
her saying we should stop wearing each other's clothes. and the memory pained me.

are you sure sister corrine would want this? i asked samuel.

yes, sister nettie, he said. try not to hold her fears against her. at the end she understood, and believed. and
forgave— whatever there was to forgive.

i should have said something sooner, i said.

he asked me to tell him about you, and the words poured out like water. i was dying to tell someone about us. i told him
about my letters to you every christmas and easter, and about how much it would have meant to us if he had gone to see
you after i left. he was sorry he hesitated to become involved.

how come he look just like them, then? she say. only bigger? and a heap more hair. how come the bible just like
everything else they make, all about them doing one thing and another, and all the colored folks doing is gitting cursed?


i never thought bout that.

nettie say somewhere in the bible it say jesus' hair was like lamb's wool, i say.

well, say shug, if he came to any of these churches we talking bout he'd have to have it conked before anybody paid him
any attention. the last thing niggers want to think about they god is that his hair kinky.

that's the truth, i say.

tea and start talking bout hot
oiling her hair.

but i let darlene worry on. sometimes i think bout the apples and the dogs, sometimes i don't. look like to me only a fool
would want you to talk in a way that feel peculiar to your mind. but she sweet and she sew good and us need something
to haggle over while us work.

i'm busy making pants for sofia now. one leg be purple, one leg be red. i dream sofia wearing these pants, one day she
was jumping over the moon.

amen,
your sister, celie


dear nettie,


walking down to harpo and sofia house it feel just like old times. cept the house new, down below the juke-joint, and it a
lot bigger than it was before. then too i feels different. look different. got on some dark blue pants and a white silk shirt

that look righteous. little red flat-heel slippers, and a flower in my hair. i pass mr. house and him sitting up on the

porch and he didn't even know who i was.

just when i raise my hand to knock, i hear a crash. sound like a chair falling over

.

her brothers there too, i whisper back. what you call them?

i don't know, he say. them three always stood by they crazy sisters. nothing yet could get 'em to budge. i wonder what
they wives have to put up with.

they all march stoutly in, shaking the church, and place sofia mother in front the pulpit.

folks crying and fanning and trying to keep a stray eye on they children, but they don't stare at sofia and her sisters. they
act like this the way it always done. i love folks.


amen


dear nettie,


the first thing i notice bout mr. is how clean he is. his skin shine. his hair brush back.

when he walk by the casket to review sofia mother's body he stop, whisper something to her. pat her shoulder. on his
way back to his seat he look over at me. i raise my fan and look off the other way.

us went back to harpo's after the funeral.

i know you won't believe this. miss celie, say sofia, but mr. act like he trying to git religion.

big a devil as he is, i say, trying is bout all he can do.

 
 ___________________________
 
k just fine.

yeah, she look fine, he say, but she got some kind of blood disease. blood sort of clot up in her veins every once in a
while, make her sick as a dog. i don't think she gon make it, he say.

great goodness of life, i say.

yeah, he say. it hard for sofia. she still have to try to prop up that white gal she raise. now her mama dead. her health
not that good either. plus, henrietta a hard row to hoe whether she sick or well.

oh, she a little mess, i say. then i think back to one of nettie's letters bout the sicknesses children have where she at in
africa. seem like to me she mention something bout blood clots. i try to remember what she say african peoples do, but i
can't. talking to mr. such a surprise i can't think of nothing. not even nothing else to say.

mr. stand waiting for me to say something, looking off up to his house. finally he say. good evening, and walk

away.

sofia say after i left, mr. live like a pig. shut up in the house so much it stunk. wouldn't let nobody

e have done. that wants to be appreciated. and africans certainly don't deal in medals. they
hardly seem to care whether missionaries exist.

don't be bitter, i said.

how can i not? he said.

the africans never asked us to come, you know. there's no use blaming them if we feel unwelcome.

it's worse than unwelcome, said samuel. the africans don't even see us. they don't even recognize us as the brothers
and sisters they sold.

oh, samuel, i said. don't.

but you know, he had started to cry. oh nettie, he said. that's the heart of it, don't you see. we love them. we try every
way we can to show that love. but they reject us. they never even listen to how we've suffered. and if they listen they say
stupid things. why don't you speak our language? they ask. why can't you remember the old ways? why aren't you
happy in america, if everyone there drives motorcars?

celie, it seemed as good a time as any to put my arms around him. which i did. and words long buried in my heart crept
to my lips. i

e to her.

i see, i said.

she and adam had an awful fight. not like any they've had before. he wasn't teasing her or chasing her around the village
or trying to tie roofleaf twigs in her hair. he was mad enough to strike her.

well, it's a good thing he didn't, i said. tashi would have jammed his head through her rug loom.

i'll be glad when we get back home, said olivia. adam isn't the only one who misses tashi.

she kissed me and her father good night. adam soon came in to do the same.

mama nettie, he said, sitting on the bed next to me, how do you know when you really love someone?

sometimes you don't know, i said.

he is a beautiful young man, celie. tall and broad-shouldered, with a deep, thoughtful voice. did i tell you he writes
verses? and loves to sing? he's a son to make you proud.

your loving sister, nettie


p.s. your brother samuel sends his love as well.


dearest celie,


when we returned home everyone seemed happy to see us. when we told them our appeal to the church and

 we are! we still keep a school for the littlest children;
those eight and over are already workers in the fields. in order to pay rent for the barracks, taxes on the land, and to buy
water and wood and food, everyone must work. so, we teach the young ones, babysit the babies, look after the old and
sick, and attend birthing mothers. our days are fuller than ever, our sojourn in england already a dream. but all things
look brighter because i have a loving soul to share them with.


your sister, nettie


dearest nettie,


the man us knowed as pa is dead.

how come you still call him pa? shug ast me the other day.

but, too late to call him alphonso. i never even remember ma calling him by his name. she always said. your pa. i reckon
to make us believe it better. anyhow, his little wife, daisy, call me up on the telephone in the middle of the night.

miss celie, she say, i got bad news. alphonso dead.

who? i ast.

alphonso, she say. your stepdaddy.

how he die? i ast. i think of killing, bein
 
 ___________________________
 
g hit by a truck, struck by lightening, lingering disease. but she say, naw, he died in
his sleep. well, not quite in his sleep, she say. us was spending a little time in bed together, you know, before us drop off.
well, i say, you have my sympathy.

yes ma'am, she say, and i thought i had this house too, but look like it belong to your sister nettie and you.

say what? i ast.

your stepdaddy been dead over a week, she say. when us went to town to hear the will read yesterday, you could have
knock me over with a feather. your real daddy owned the land and the house and the store. he left it to your mama.
when your mama died, it passed on to you and your sister nettie. i don't know why alphonso never told you that
well, i say, anything coming from him, i don't want it.

i hear daisy suck in her breath. how about your sister nettie, she say. 
 
 ___________________________
 
ttle bit then. by the time shug roll over and ast me who it is, i'm beginning to see the light.

don't be a fool, shug say, nudging me with her foot. you got your own house now. your daddy and mama left it for you.
that dog of a stepdaddy just a bad odor passing through.

but i never had no house, i say. just to think about having my own house enough to scare me. plus, this house i'm gitting
is bigger than shug's, got more land around it and, it come with a store.

my god, i say to shug. me and nettie own a drygood store. what us gon sell?

how bout pants? she say.

so us hung up the phone and rush down home again to look at the property.

about a mile before us got to town us come up on the entrance to the colored cemetery. shug was sound asleep, but
something told me i ought to drive in. pretty soon i see something look like a short skyscraper and i stop the car and go
up to it. sure enough it's got alphonso's name on it. got a lot of other stuff on it too. member of this and that. leading

h the keys i run from one room to another
like i'm crazy. look at this, i say to shug. look at that! she look, she grin. she hug me whenever she git the chance and i
stand still.

you doin' all right. miss celie, she say. god know where you live.

then she took some cedar sticks out of her bag and lit them and gave one of them to me. us started at the very top of the
house in the attic, and us smoked it all the way down to the basement, chasing out all the evil and making a place for
good.

oh, nettie, us have a house! a house big enough for us and our children, for your husband and shug. now you can come
home cause you have a home to come to!


your loving sister, celie


dear nettie,


my heart broke.

shug love somebody else.

maybe if i had stayed in memphis last summer it never would have happen. but i spent the summer fixing up the house. i
thought if you come anytime soon, i want it to be ready. and it is real pretty, now, and comfortable. and i found me a
nice lady to live in it and

w can you leave me? you're my friend. i love this child and i'm scared to death. he's a third of my
age. a third of my size. even a third of my color. she try to laugh again. you know he gon hurt me worse than i'm hurting
you. don't leave me, please.

just then the door bell ring. shug wiped her face and went to answer it, saw who it was and kept on out the door. soon i
heard a car drive off. i went on up to bed. but sleep remain a stranger to this night.

pray for me.
your sister, celie


dear nettie,


the only thing keep me alive is watching henrietta fight for her life. and boy can she fight. every time she have an attack
she scream enough to wake the dead. us do what you say the peoples do in africa. us feed her yams every single day.
just our luck she hate yams and she not too polite to let us know. everybody for miles around try to come up with yam
dishes that don't taste like yams. us git plates of yam eggs, yam chitlins, yam goat. and soup. my god, folks be making
soup out of everyt

 to cry.

he say, celie, tell me the truth. you don't like me cause i'm a man?

i blow my nose. take off they pants, i say, and men look like frogs to me. no matter how you kiss 'em, as far as i'm
concern, frogs is what they stay.

i see, he say.

by the time i got back home i was feeling so bad i couldn't do nothing but sleep. i tried to work on some new pants i'm
trying to make for pregnant women, but just the thought of anybody gitting pregnant make me want to cry.

your sister, celie


dear nettie,


the only piece of mail mr. ever put directly in my hand is a telegram that come from the united states department

of defense. it say the ship you and the children and your husband left africa in was sunk by german mines off the coast of
someplace call gibralta. they think you all drowned. plus, the same day, all the letters i wrote to you over the years come
back unopen.

i sit here in this big house by myself trying to sew, but what good is sewing gon do? what good is anything? being alive

we have had to endure here is indifference and a certain understandable shallowness in our personal

dearest celie,

last night i stopped writing because olivia came in to tell me adam is missing. he can only have gone after tashi.

pray for his safety.
your sister, nettie


dearest nettie,


sometimes i think shug never love me. i stand looking at my naked self in the looking glass. what would she love? i ast
myself. my hair is short and kinky because i don't straighten it anymore. once shug say she love it no need to. my skin
dark. my nose just a nose. my lips just lips. my body just any woman's body going through the changes of age. nothing
special here for nobody to love. no honey colored curly hair, no cuteness. nothing young and fresh. my heart must be

happiness was just a trick in your case. just cause you never
had any before shug, you thought it was time to have some, and that it was gon last. even thought you had the trees with
you. the whole earth. the stars. but look at you. when shug left, happiness desert.

every once in a while i git a postcard from shug. her and germaine in new york, in california. gone to see mary agnes
and grady in panama.

mr. seem to be the only one understand my feeling.

i know you hate me for keeping you from nettie, he say. and now she dead.

but i don't hate him, nettie. and i don't believe you dead. how can you be dead if i still feel you? maybe, like god, you
changed into something different that i'll have to speak to in a different way, but you not dead to me nettie. and never
will be. sometime when i git tired of talking to myself i talk to you. i even try to reach our children.

mr. still can't believe i have children. where you git children from? he ast.

you mean he knowed he

for us, say sofia. she don't look so good herself, and a little water stand in her eyes. after miss
eleanor jane and reynolds stanley leave, she say. it's times like this make me know us didn't make this world. and all the
colored folks talking bout loving everybody just ain't looked hard at what they thought they said.

so what else new?

well, your sister too crazy to kill herself. most times i feels like shit but i felt like shit before in my life and what happen? i
had me a fine sister name nettie. i had me another fine woman friend name shug. i had me some fine children growing
up in africa, singing and writing verses. the first two months was hell though, i tell the world. but now shug's six months
is come and gone and she ain't come back. and i try to teach my heart not to want nothing it can't have.

besides, she give me so many good years. plus, she learning new things in her new life. now she and germaine staying
with one of her children.

dear celie, she wrote me. me and germaine

d ast me what was so special bout my pants.


anybody can wear them, i said.

men and women not suppose to wear the same thing, he said. men spose to wear the pants.

so i said. you ought to tell that to the mens in africa.

say what? he ast. first time he ever thought bout what africans do.

people in africa try to wear what feel comfortable in the heat, i say. of course, missionaries have they own ideas bout
dress. but left to themself, africans wear a little sometimes, or a lot, according to nettie. but men and women both
preshate a nice dress.

robe you said before, he say.

robe, dress. not pants, anyhow.

well, he say. i'll be dog.

and men sew in africa, too, i say.

they do? he ast.

yeah, i say. they not so backward as mens here.

when i was growing up, he said, i use to try to sew along with mama cause that's what she was always doing. but
everybody laughed at me. but you know, i liked it.

well, nobody gon laugh at you now, i said. here, help me stitch in these pockets.

but i don
 
 ___________________________
 
't know how, he say.

i'll show you, i said. and i did.

now us sit sewing and talking and smoking our pipes.

guess what, i say to him, folks in africa where nettie and the children is believe white people is black peoples children.
naw, he say, like this interesting but his mind really on the slant of his next stitch.

they named adam some other name soon as he arrive. they say the white missionaries before nettie and them come
told them all about adam from the white folks point of view and what the white folks know. but they know who adam is
from they own point of view. and for a whole lot longer time ago.

and who that? mr. ast.

the first man that was white. not the first man. they say nobody so crazy they think they can say who was the first man.
but everybody notice the first white man cause he was white.

mr. frown, look at the different color thread us got. thread his needle, lick his finger, tie 
 
 ___________________________
 
t you never hear of white folks having nothing
black unless some black man been messing with 'em. and no white folks been in africa back yonder when all this happen.
so these olinka people heard about adam and eve from the white missionaries and they heard about how the serpent
tricked eve and how god chased them out of the garden of eden. and they was real curious to hear this, cause after they
had chased the white olinka children out of the village they hadn't hardly thought no more about it. nettie say one thing
about africans. out of sight, out of mind. and another thing, they don't like nothing around them that look or act
different. they want everybody to be just alike. so you know somebody white wouldn't last long. she say seem like to her
the africans throwed out the white olinka peoples for how they look. they throwed out the rest of us, all us who become

slaves, for how us act. seem like us just wouldn't do right no matter how us try. well, you know how niggers is. can't

nobody t

ge because they was
naked. their word for naked is white. but since they are covered by color they are not naked. they said anybody looking
at a white person can tell they naked, but black people can not be naked because they can not be white.

yeah, say mr. . but they was wrong.

right, i said. adam and eve prove it. what they did, these olinka peoples, was throw out they own children, just cause
they was a little different.

i bet they do that same kind of stuff today, mr. say.

oh, from what nettie say, them africans is a mess. and you know what the bible say, the fruit don't fall too far from the
tree. and something else, i say. guess who they say the snake is?

us, no doubt, say mr. .

right, i say. whitefolks sign for they parents. they was so mad to git throwed out and told they was naked they made up


they minds to crush us wherever they find us, same as they would a snake.

you reckon? mr. ast.

that's what these olinka peoples say. but they say just like they know history before t
 
 ___________________________
 
the white folks no longer on the earth, the only way to stop making
somebody the serpent is for everybody to accept everybody else as a child of god, or one mother's children, no matter
what they look like or how they act. and guess what else about the snake?

what? he ast.

these olinka people worship it. they say who knows, maybe it is kinfolks, but for sure it's the smartest, cleanest, slickest
thing they ever seen.

these folks sure must have a heap of time just to sit and think, say mr. .

nettie say they real good at thinking, i say. but they think so much in terms of thousands of years they have a hard time
gitting themself through one.

so what they name adam?

something sound like omatangu, i say. it mean a un-naked man somewhere near the first one god made that knowed
what he was. a whole lot of the men that come before the first man was men, but none of 'em didn't know it. you know
how long it take some mens to notice anything, i say.

took me long enough to notice you such good c

py. so happy, celie. tashi and adam omatangu.

samuel married them, of course, and all the people left in the compound came to wish them happiness and an
abundance of roofleaf forever. olivia stood up with the bride and a friend of adam's— a man too old to have joined the
mbeles — stood up with him. immediately after the wedding we left the compound, riding in a lorry that took us to a boat
at the coast inlet that flows out to sea.

in a few weeks, we will all be home.


your loving sister, nettie


dear nettie,


mr. talk to shug a lot lately by telephone. he say as soon as he told her my sister and her family was missing, she

and germaine made a beeline for the state department trying to find out what happen. he say shug say it just kill her to
think i'm down here suffering from not knowing. but nothing happen at the state department. nothing at the department
of defense. it's a big war. so much going on. one ship lost feel like nothing, i guess. plus, colored don't count to those

top her head. a tall youngish man and two robust looking youngish women. the whitehaired man say something to the
driver of the car and the car leave. they all stand down there at the edge of the drive surrounded by boxes and bags and
all kinds of stuff.

by now my heart is in my mouth and i can't move.

it's nettie, albert say, gitting up.

all the people down by the drive look up at us. they look at the house. the yard. shug and albert's cars. they look round
at the fields. then they commence to walk real slow up the walk to the house.

i'm so scared i don't know what to do. feel like my mind stuck. i try to speak, nothing come. try to git up, almost fall.
shug reach down and give me a helping hand. albert press me on the arm.
