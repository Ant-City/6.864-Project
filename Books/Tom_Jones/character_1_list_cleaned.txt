 - 
                sophia western is fielding's beautiful, generous heroine and the daughter of the 
violent squire western. like tom, sophia lavishes gifts on the poor, and she 
treats people of all classes with such respect that one landlady cannot believe 
she is a "gentlewoman." sophia manages to reconcile her love for tom, her filial 
duty to her father, and her hatred for blifil through her courage and patience. 
sophia's natural courtesy can be contrasted with her aunt western's artificial 
manners.
