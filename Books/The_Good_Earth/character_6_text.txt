at wang lung cried out:

'i cannot cut it off without asking my father!' and the
barber laughed and skirted the round spot of hair.

when it was finished and the money counted into the
barber's wrinkled, water-soaked hand, wang lung had a
moment of horror. so much money! but walking down
the street again with the wind fresh upon his shaven skin,
he said to himself:

'it is only once.'

he went to the market, then, and bought two pounds
of pork and watched the butcher as he wrapped it in a
dried lotus leaf, and then, hesitating, he bought- also six
ounces of beef. when all had been bought, even two fresh
squares of bean-curd, shivering in a jelly upon its leaf, he
went to a candlemaker's shop and there he bought a pair
of incense sticks. then he turned his steps with great shy-
ness toward the house of hwang.

once at the gate of the house he was seized with terror. ]
how had he come alone? he should have asked his father — '
his uncle — even his nearest neighbour, ching — any one to

brown baked ducks that had been turned slowly on a spit
before coals, and the white salted ducks, and the strings
of duck giblets; and so with the shops that sold geese and
pheasant and every kind of fowl.

as for the vegetables, there was everything which the
hand of man could coax from the soil; glittering red rad-
ishes and white, hollow lotus root and taro, green cab-
bages and celery, curling bean sprouts and brown chestnuts
and garnishes of fragrant, cress. there was nothing which
the appetite of man might desire that was not to be found
upon the streets of the markets of that city. and going
hither and thither were the vendors of sweets and fruits
and nuts and of hot delicacies of sweet potatoes browned
in sweet oils and little delicately spiced balls of pork
wrapped in dough and steamed, and sugar cakes made
from glutinous rice;

before a handful of days had passed it seem-
ed to wang lung that he had never been away from
his land, as indeed, in his heart he never had. with three
pieces of the gold he bought good seed from the south,
full grains of wheat and of rice and of corn, and for very



114



recklessness of riches he bought seeds the like of which he
had never planted before, celery and lotus for his pond
and great red radishes that are stewed with pork for a
feast dish and smallr^ed-f^agrant beans.

with five gold pieces he bought an ox from a farmer
ploughing in the field, and this before ever he reached his
own land. he saw the man ploughing and he stopped and
they all stopped, the old man and the children and the
woman, eager as they were to reach the house and the
land, and they looked at the ox. wang lung had been
struck with its great strong neck and noticed at once the

nted face closely and j
with intensity as though each were real. before this they j
had all seemed equally beautiful, before this when there
had been no question of choosing. but now there were
clearly some more beautiful than others, and out of the
score and more he chose three most beautiful, and out of
the three he chose again and he chose one most beautiful,
a small, slender thing, a body light as a bamboo and a
little face as pointed as a kitten's face, and one handj
clasping the stem of a lotus flower in bud, and the hand
as delicate as the tendril of a fern uncurled.

he stared at her and as he stared a heat like wine poured
through his veins.

'she is like a flower on a quince tree,' he said suddenly
aloud, and hearing his own voice he was alarmed and
ashamed and he rose hastily and put down his money
and went out and into the darkness that has now fallen
and so to his home.

but over the fields and the water the moonlight hung,
a net of silver mist, and in his body his blood ran se

it out full of silver and he said
to her:

'is it enough and is it not enough?'

she stared at the handful of silver and said then without
further delay:
\_y 'come and say which one you wish.'

and wang lung, without knowing what he said, mut-
tered forth:

'well, and i do not know that i want anything.' and
then his desire overcame him and he whispered, 'that
little one— that one with the pointed chin and the little
small face, a face like a quince blossom for white and
pink, and she holds a lotus bud in her hand.'

the woman nodded easily and beckoning him she
threaded her way between the crowded tables, and wang
lung followed her at a distance. at first it seemed to him
that every man looked up and watched him but when he




146



took courage to see he saw that none paid him any heed,
except for one or two who called out, 'is it late enough,
then to go to th& women?' and another called, 'here is
a lusty fellow who needs must begin early.'

but by this time they were walking up the n
 
 ___________________________
 
 way up when he passed a window and looked into
the sky. the woman led the way down a close dark hall,
then, and she cried as she went:

'now here is the first of the night!'

all along the hall doors opened suddenly and here and
there girls' heads showed themselves in patches of light, as
flowers burst out of their sheaths in the sun, but cuckoo
called cruelly:

'no, not you— and not you — no one has asked for any i
of you! this one is for the little pink-faced dwarf from i
soochow — for lotus!'

a ripple of sound ran down the hall, indistinct, derisive,
and one girl, ruddy as a pomegranate, called out in a big
voice :

'and lotus may have this fellow — he smells of the
fields and of garlic!'

this wang lung heard, although he disdained to an-
swer, although her words smote him like a daggerthrust
because he feared that he looked indeed what he was, a
farmer. but he went on stoutly when he remembered the
good silver in his girdle, and at last the woman struck a
closed door harshly

with the flat palm of her hand and
went in without waiting and there upon a bed covered with
a flowered red quilt, sat a slender girl.

if one had told him there were small hands like these
he would not have believed it, hands so small and bones
so fine and fingers so pointed with long nails stained the
colour of lotus buds, deep and rosy. and if one had told
him that there could be feet like these, little feet thrust
into pink satin shoes no longer than a man's middle finger,



h7



and swinging childishly over the bed's edge-— if any one
had told him he would not have believed it.

he sat stiffly on the bed beside her, staring at her,
and he saw that she was like the picture and having seen
the picture he would have known her if he had met her.
but most of all her hand was like the painted hand, curling

me?'

and all the time his heart was like to burst because he
could not be satisfied of this girl.

thus as the days went on and he lived only to pass
the day until the evening came, he would not look at the
grave faces of o-lan and of the children, suddenly sober in
their play when he approached, nor even at his old father
who peered at him and asked:

'what is this sickness that turns you full of evil temper
and your skin as yellow as clay?'

and as these days went past to the night, the girl lotus
did what she would with him. when she laughed at the
braid of his hair, although part of every day he spent
in braiding and in brushing it, and said, 'now the men
of the south do not have these monkey tails!' he went
without a word and had it cut off, although neither by
laughter or scorn had any one been able to persuade him
to it before.

when o-lan saw what he had done she burst out in
terror :

\~ 'you have cut off your life!'
but he shouted at her:

'and shall i look an old-fashioned fool 
 
 ___________________________
 
for ever? all
the young men of the city have their hair cut short.'

150



yet he was afraid in his heart of what he had done,
and yet so he would have cut off his life if the girl lotus
had commanded it or desired it, because she had every
beauty wljiich had ever come into his mind to desire in a
woman. \

his good brown body that he washed but rarely, deem-
ing the clean sweat of his labour washing enough for or-
dinary times, his body he now began to examine as if it
were another man's, and he washed himself every day so
that his wife said, troubled:

'you will die with all this washing!'

he bought sweet-smelling soap in the shop, a piece of
red' scented stuff from foreign 
 
 ___________________________
 
parts, and he rubbed it on
his flesh, and not for any price would he have eaten a
stalk of garlic, although it was a thing he had loved be-
fore, lest he stink before the girl lotus.

and none in his house knew what to make of all these
things.

he bought also new stuffs for clothes, and although
o-lan had always cut his robes, making them wide and
long for good measure and sewing them stoutly this way
and that for strength, now he was scornful of her cutting
and sewing and he took the stuffs to a tailor in the town
and he had his clothes made as the men in the town had
theirs, light grey silk for a robe, cut neatly to his body
and with little to spare, and over this a bla

dent face of his uncle's son, he could scarcely keep his
hand down from slapping it! and for three days he did
not go into the town because of his anger.

then when they were all accustomed to what had taken
place and when o-lan had said to him, 'cease to be angry.
it is a thing to be borne,' and wang lung saw that his



155



uncle and his uncle's wife and son would be courteous
enough for the sake of their food and their shelter, then
his thoughts turned more violently than ever to the girl
lotus and he muttered to himself:

'when a man's house is full of wild dogs he must seek
peace elsewhere.'

and all the old fever and pain burned in him and he
was still never satisfied of his love.

now what o-lan had not seen in her simplicity nor the
old man because of the dimness of his age nor ching be-
cause of his friendship, the wife of wang lung's uncle
saw at once and she cried out, the laughter slanting from
her eyes:

'now wang lung is seeking to pluck a flower some-
where.' and when o-la

who must needs drink from
one cup.' thus she spoke, knowing what he would say
next, and he went on as she expected :

'but who will negotiate for me and be the middleman?
a man cannot go to a woman and say "come to my house''.'

to this she answered instantly:

'nowjdo you leave this affair in my hands. only tell
me which woman it is and i will manage the affair.'

then wang lung answered unwillingly and timidly,
for he had never spoken her name aloud before to any one:

'it is the woman called lotus.'

it seemed to him that every one must have heard of
lotus, forgetting how only a short two summers' moons
before he had not known that she lived. he was impatient,
therefore, when his uncle's wife asked further:

'and where her home?'

'now where,' he answered with asperity, 'where except
in the great tea-shop on the main street of the town?'

'the one called the house of flowers?'

'and what other?' wang lung retorted.

she mused awhile, fingering her pursed lower lip, and
she said at last:

 
 ___________________________
 
he said, 'tell her she shall do
no work of any kind in my house but she shall wear only
silken garments and eat shark's fins if she will every day,'
until at last the fat woman grew impatient and cried out at
him, rolling her eyes back and forth:

'enough and enough! am i a fool, or is this the first
time i have managed a man and a maid? leave me alone
and i will do it. i have said everything many times.'

then there was nothing to do except to gnaw his fingers
and to see the house suddenly, as lotus might see it and
he hurried o-lan into this and that, sweeping and washing
and moving tables and chairs, so that she, poor woman,

158



grew more and more terror-stricken, for well she knew by 1
now, although he said nothing, what was to come to her.

now wang lung could not bear to sleep any more with
o-lan and he said to himself that with two women in the
house there must be more rooms and another court and
there must be a place where he could go with his love and
be separate. so while he w
 
 ___________________________
 
e would not tell them anything,
but he superintended them himself, so that he need not
talk with ching even of what he did. and the men digged
the earth from the fields and made the walls and beat them
down, and wang lung sent to the town and bought tiles
for the roof.

then when the rooms were finished and the earth smooth-
ed and beaten down for a floor, he had bricks bought
and the men set them closely together and welded them
with lime and there was a good brick floor to the three
rooms for lotus. and wang lung bought red cloth to
hang at the doors for curtains and he bought a new table
and two carved chairs to put on either side and two painted
scrolls of pictured hills and water to hang upon the wall
behind the table.

and he bought a round red lacquered comfit dish with
a cover, and in this he jput sesame cakes and larded sweets
; and he put'teetjox on the table. then he bought a wide
and deep carven be37big enough for a small room in itself,
land he bought flowered curtains to hang

about it. but in
jail this he was ashamed to ask o-lan anything, and so in
the evenings his uncle's wife came in and she hung the
bed curtains and did the things a man is too clumsy to do.

then all was finished and there was nothing to do, and
a moon of days had passed and the thing was not yet
complete. so wang lung dallied alone in the little new
court he had built for lotus and he thought of a little pool
to make in the centre of the court, and he called a labourer
and the man dug a pool three feet square and set it about

with tiles, and wang lung went into the city and bought
five goldfish for it. then he could think of nothing more
to be done, and again he waited impatient and fevered.

t)uring all this time he said nothing to any one except to
scold the children if they were filthy at their noses or to roar
out at o-lan that she had not brushed her h
 
 ___________________________
 
until he heard his
uncle's wife calling loudly for him to come out, for one[
was at the gate.

then abashed and as though he had never seen the girl
before he went slowly out, hanging his head over his fine
clothes, and his eyes looking here and there but never
ahead. but cuckoo hailed him merrily:

'well, and i did not know we would be doing business
like this!'

then she went to the chair which the men had set down
and she lifted the curtain and clucked her tongue and she
said:

'come out, my lotus flower, here is your house and *
here your lord.'

and wang lung was in an agony because he saw upon
the faces of the chairmen wide grins of laughter and he
thought to himself:

161

5056, 11.



'now these are loafers from the town streets and they
are worthless fellows,' and he was angry that he felt his
face hot and red and so he would not speak aloud at all.

then the curtain was lifted and before he knew what
he did he looked and he saw sitting in the shadowy recess
of the chair, painted a

nd cool as a lily, the girl lotus. he
forgot everything, even his anger against the grinning
fellows from the town, everything but that he had bought
this woman for his own and she had come to his house
for ever, sind he stood stiff and trembling, watching as
she rose, graceful as though a wind had passed over a
flower. then as he watched and could not take his eyes
away, she took cuckoo's hand and stepped out, keeping >
her head bowed and her eyelids dropped as she walked,
tottering and swaying upon her little feet, and leanin

he new rooms that wang lung had built for her. and of
all wang lung's house there was none to see her pass, for j
he had sent the labourers and ching away for the day to j
work on a distant field, and o-lan had gone somewhere he
knew not and had taken the two little ones with her and
the boys were in school and the old man slept against the
wall and heard and saw nothing, and as for the poor fool, j
she saw no one who came and went and knew no face
except her father's and her mother's. but when lotus had
gone in cuckoo drew the curtains after her. j

then after a time wang lung's uncle's wife came out,
laughing a little maliciously, and she dusted her hands
together as though to free them of something that clung
to them.

'she reeks of perfume and paint, that one,' she said still
laughing, 'like a regular bad one she smells.' and then
she said with a deeper malice, 'she is not so young as she i \
looks, my nephew ! i will dare to say this, that if she had \
not been on the edge of an age wh
 
 ___________________________
 
 and then seeing the anger on wang lung's
face at this too plain speaking she added hastily, 'but beau-
tiful she is and i have never seen another more beautiful
and it will be as sweet as the eight jewelled rice at a feast
after your years with the thick-boned slave from the house
of hwang.'

but wang lung answered nothing, only he moved here
and there through the house and he listened and he could
not be still. at last he dared to lift the red curtain and to
go into the court he had built for lotus and then into
the darkened room where she was and there he was beside
her for the whole day until night. ^

all this time o-lan had not come near the house. at
dawn she had taken a hoe from the wall and she called the
children and she took a little cold food wrapped up in
a cabbage leaf and she had not returned. but when night
came on she entered, silent and earth-stained and dark
with weariness, and the children silent behind her, and she
said nothing to any one, but she went into the kitchen

and i
prepared food and set it upon the table as she always did,
and she called the old man and put the chopsticks in his
hand and she fed the poor fool and then she ate a little
with the children. then when they slept and wang lung
still sat at the table dreaming she washed herself for sleeping >
and at last she went into her accustomed room and slept
alone' upon her bed.

then did wang lung eat and drink of his love night
and day. day after day he went into the room where lotus
| lay indolent upon her bed and he sat beside her and watched
i her at all she did. she never came forth in the heat of the
early autumn days, but she- lay while the woman cuckoo
bathed her slender body with lukewarm water and rubbed
oil into her flesh and perfume and oil into her hair. for
lotus had said wilfully that cuckoo must stay with her
as her servant and she paid her prodigally so that the woman
was willing enough to serve one instead of a score, and she
and lotus, her mistress, dwelt 
 
 ___________________________
 
t cuckoo put
small embroidered shoes, and then the girl walked into the
court and examined the little pool with its five goldfish,
and wang lung stood and stared at the wonder of what
he had. she swayed upon her little feet and to wang lung
there was nothing so wonderful for beauty in the world as
her pointed little feet and her curling helpless hands.

and he ate and drank of his love and he feasted alone,
and he was satisfied.

xxi

it was not to be supposed that the coming
of this one called lotus and of her serving-woman
cuckoo into wang lung's house could be accomplished
altogether without stir and discord of some sort, since,
more than one woman under one roof is not for peace.
but wang lung had not foreseen it. and even though he
saw by o-lan's sullen looks and cuckoo's sharpness that
something was amiss, he would not pay heed to it and he
was careless of any one so long as he was still fierce with
his desire.

nevertheless, when day passed into night, and night,
changed into dawn, w
 
 ___________________________
 
ang lung saw. that it was true the
sun rose in the morning, and this woman lotus was there,
and the moon rose in its season and she was there for his
hand to grasp when it would, and his thirst of love was
somewhat slaked and he saw things he had not seen before.*

for one thing, he saw that there was trouble at once
between o-lan and cuckoo. this was an astonishment to



164



him, for he was\prepared for o-lan to hate lotus, having
heard many times of such things, and some women will
even hang themselves upon a beam with a rope when a
man takes a second woman into the house, and others will
scold and contrive to make his life worthless for what he ,
has done, and he was glad that o-lan was a silent woman, \
for at least she could not think of words against him. but
he had not foreseen that whereas she would be silent of
lotus, her anger would find its vent against cuckoo.

now wang lung had thought only of lotus a

e.'

this she said with her tears, always abundant and ready
and glittering in the corners of her pretty eyes, and wang
lung could have denied her nothing she asked when she
looked up at him so. besides, it was true enough that the
girl had no one to serve her, and it was true she would be
alone in his house, for it was plain enough and to be
expected that o-lan would not serve the second one, and
she would not speak to her or notice that she was in the
house at all. there was only the uncle of lotus then, and
it was against wang lung's stomach to have that one
peeping and prying and near to lotus for her to talk to
of him, and so cuckoo was as good as any and he knew
no other woman who would come. — .

but it seemed that o-lan, when she saw t cuckoo, grew )
angry with a deep and sullen anger that wang lung had /
never seen and did not know was in her. cuckoo was
willing enough to be friends, since she had her pay from
wang lung, albeit she did not forget that in the great house
she had b
 
 ___________________________
 
delicacies
which the other one needs for her flower-like body and
which you also enjoy. you shall cook what you please
in it.'

and so he bade the labourers build a little room and
an earthen stove in it and he bought a good cauldron.
and cuckoo was pleased because he said, 'you shall cook
what you please in it.'

as for wang lung, he said to himself that at last his
affairs were settled and his women at peace and he could
enjoy his love. and it seemed to him freshly that he could
never tire of lotus and of the way she pouted at him with
the lids dropped like lily petals over her great eyes, and at
the way laughter gleamed out of her eyes when she glanced
up at him.

but after all this matter of the new kitchen became a
thorn in his body, for cuckoo went to the town every day
and she bought this and that of expensive foods , that are
imported from the southern cities. there were foods he had
never even heard of: lichee nuts and dried honey dates
and curious cakes of rice flour and nuts and 
 
 ___________________________
 
red sugar,
and horned fish from the sea and many other things. and
these all cost money more than he liked to give out, but
still not so much, he was sure, as cuckoo told him, and
yet he was afraid to say, 'you are eating my flesh,' for
fear she would be offended and angry at him, and it would
displease lotus, and so there was nothing he could do ex-
cept to put his hand unwillingly to his girdle. and this

168



was a thorn to him day after day, and because there was
none to whom he could complain of it, the thorn pierced
more deeply continually, and it cooled a little of the fire
of love in him for lotus.



and there was yet another small thorn that sprang j
from the first, and it was that his uncle's wife, who loved
good food, went often into the inner court at meal times,
and she grew free the

re, and wang lung was not pleased
that out of his house lotus chose this woman for friend.
the three women ate well in the inner courts, and they
talked unceasingly, whispering and laughing, and there was
something that lotus liked in the wife of his uncle and the
three were happy together, and this wang lung did not
like.

but still there was nothing to be done, for when he
said gently and to coax her:

'now, lotus, my flower, and do not waste your sweet-
ness on' an old fat hag like that one. i need it for my own
heart, and she is a deceitful and untrustworthy creature,
and i do not like it that she is near you from dawn to
sunseft^ lotus was fretful and she answered peevishly,
pouting her lips and hanging her head away from him:

'now and i have no one except you and i have no
friends and i am used to a merry house and in yours
there is no one except the first wife who hates me and these
children of you
 
 ___________________________
 
re a plague to me, and i have
no oner 2 ""

then she used her weapons against him and she would
not let him into her room that night and she complained
and said:

'you do not love me, for if you did you would wish
me to be happy.

then wang lung was humbled and anxious and he
was submissive and he was sorry and he said:

'let it be only as you wish and for ever/

then she forgave him royally and he was afraid to
rebuke her in any way for what she wished to do, and
after that when he came to her lotus, if she were talking or
drinking tea or eating some sweetmeat with his uncles'
jwife, would bid him wait and was careless with him, and




he strode away, angry that she was unwilling for him to
come in when this other woman sat there, and his love
cooled a little, although he did not know it himself.

he was angry, moreover, that his uncles's wife ate of the
rich foods that he had to buy for lotus and that she grew
fat and more oily than she had been, but he could say
nothing, for his uncle's
 
 ___________________________
 
 wife was clever and she was
courteous to him and flattered him with good words and
rose when he came into the room.

and so his love for lotus was not whole and perfect
as it had been before, absorbing utterly his mind and his
body. it was pierced through and through with small
angers which were the more sharp because they must be
endured and because he could no longer go even to o-lan
freely for speech, seeing that now their life was sundered.

then like a field of thorns springing up from one root
and spreading here and there, there was yet more to trouble
wang lung. one day his father, whom one would say saw
nothing at any time so 
 
 ___________________________
 
drowsy with age he was, woke sud-
denly out of his sleeping in the sun and he tottered, lean-
ing on his dragon-headed staff which wang lung had
bought for him on his seventieth birthday, to the doorway
where a curtain hung between the main room and the court
where lotus walked. now the old man had never noticed
the door before, nor when the court was built, and seem-
ingly he did not know whether any one had been added
to the house or not, and wang lung had never told him,
"i have another woman," for the old man was too deaf to
make anything out of a voice if it told him something new
and of which he had not thought.

but on this day he saw without reason this doorway
and he went to it and drew the curtain, and it happened
that it was at an hour of evening whe
 
 ___________________________
 
n wang lung walked
with lotus in the court, and they stood beside the pool
and looked at the fish, but wang lung looked at lotus.
then when the old man saw his son standing beside a
slender painted girl he cried out in his shrill cracked voice.

'there is a harlot in the house!' and he would not be
silent although wang lung, fearing lest lotus grow angry
— for this small creature could shriek and scream and beat



170



her hands together if she were angered at all — went forward
aiidtledtbe old man away into the outer court and soothed
him, saying:

'now calm your heart, my father. it is not a harlot
but a second woman in the house.'

but the old man would not be silent and whether he
heard what was said or not no one knew, only he shouted
over and over. c there is a harlot here !' and he said suddenly
seeing wang lung near hi
 
 ___________________________
 
m, 'and i had one woman
and my father had one woman and we farmed the land.*
and again he cried out after a time, 'i say it is a harlot!'

and so the old man woke from his aged and fitful sleeping
with a sort of cunning hatred against lotus. he would go
to the doorway of her court and shout suddenly into the air :

'harlot!'

or he would draw aside the curtain into her court and
then spit furiously upon the tiles. and he would hunt
small stones and throw them with his feeble arm into the
little pool to scare the fish, and in the mean ways of a
mischievous child he expressed his anger.

and this too made a disturbance in wang lung's house,
for he was ashamed to rebuke his father, and yet he feared
the anger of lotus, since he had f

ound, she had a pretty
petulant temper that she loosed easily. and this anxiety to
keep his father from angering her was wearisome to him and
it was another thing to make of his love a burden to him.

one day he heard a shriek from the inner courts and
he ran in" for he heard it was the voice of lotus, and there
he found that the two younger children, the boy and the
girl born alike, had between them led into the inner court
his elder daughter, his poor fool. now the four other
children were constantly curious about this lady who lived
in the inner court, but the two elder boys were conscious
and shy and knew well enough why she was there and what
their father had to do with her, although they never spoke
of her unless to each other secretly. but the two younger
ones could never be satisfied

 with their peepings and their
exclamations, and sniffing of the perfume she wore and
dipping their fingers into the bowls of food that cuckoo

lotus complained many times to wang lung that his
children were a plague to her and she wished there were a
way to lock them out so that she need not be plagued with
them. but this he was not willing to do, and he answered
her in jest:

'well, and they like to look at a lovely face as much
as their father does.'

and he did nothing except to forbid them to enter her
courts and when he saw them they did not, but when he
did not see them they ran in and out secretly. but the |
elder daughter knew nothi

ng of anything, but only sat in |
the sun against the wall of the outer court, smiling and i
playing with her bit of twisted cloth.

on this day, however, the two elder sons being away i
at school, the two younger children had conceived the
notion that the fool must also see the lady in the inner
courts, and they had taken her hands and dragged her into
the court and she stood before lotus, who had never seen
her and sat and stared at her. now when the fool saw the
bright silk of the coat lotus wore and the shining jade in
her ears, she was moved by some strange joy at the sight
and she put put her hands to grasp the bright colours and
she laughed aloud, a laugh that was only sound and
meaningless. and lotus was frightened and screamed out,
so that wang lung came running in, and lotus shook with
her anger and leaped up and down on her little feet and
shook her finger at the poor laughing girl and cried out:

'i w r ill not stay in this house if that one comes near
me, and i was not to
 
 ___________________________
 
 not by you
who have no son in your womb for any man.' and he
gathered the children together and said to them: 'now go
out, my son and my daughter, and come no more to this
woman's court, for she does not love you if she does

not loyeyou she does not love your father, either/ and to
the elder girl he said with great gentleness: c and you, my
poor fool, come back to your place in the sun.' and she

ismilee! and he took her by the hand and led her away.
for he was most angry of all that lotus dared to curse

i this child of his and call her idiot, and a load of fresh
pain for the girl fell upon his heart, so that for a day and

itwo days he would not go near lotus, but he played with

i the children and he went into the town and he bought a
circle of barley candy for his poor fool and he comforted
himself with her baby pleasure in the sweet sticky stuff.
and when he went in to lotus again neither of them

! said anything that he had not come for two days, but she
took special troubl

e to please him, for when he came his
uncle's wife was there drinking tea, and lotus excused her-
self and said:

'now here is my lord come for me and i must be
obedient to him for this is my pleasure,' and she stood
until the woman went away.

then she went up to wang lung and took his hand
and drew it to her face and she wooed him. but he, although
he loved her again, loved her not so wholly as before,
and never again so wholly as he had loved her.

there came a day when summer was ended and the
sky in the early morning was clear and cold and blue as
sea water and a clean aut

t as black sugar, and still dark
with the wetness of the land upon it. this he did for the
sheer joy he had in it and not for any necessity, and when
he was weary he lay down upon his land he slept and
the health of the earth spread into his flesh and he was
healed of his sickness.

when night came and the sun had gone blazing down
without a cloud to dim it, he strode into his house, his body
aching and weary and triumphant, and he tore aside the
curtain that went into the inner court and there lotus
walked in her silken robes. when she saw him she cried
out at the earth upon his clothes and shuddered when he
came near her.

■ but he laughed and he seized her small, curling hands
in his soiled ones and he laughed again and said:
f"~ 'now you see that your lord is but a farmer and you
are a farmer's wife!'

then she cried out with spirit :

'a farmer's wife i am not, be you what you like!'

and he laughed again and went out from her easily.

he ate his evening rice all stained as he was wi

planting and day after day he laboured at it, and the
paleness which the summer of his love had set on his flesh
darkened to a deep brown under the sun, and his hands,
which had peeled off their calloused parts under the idle-
ness of love, hardened again where the hoe pressed and
where the plough handles set their mark.

when he came in at noon and at night he ate well of
the food which o-lan prepared for him, good rice and cab-
bage and bean-curd, and good garlic rolled into wheat
bread. when lotus held her small nose under her hand
at his coming and cried out at his reek, he laughed and
cared nothing and he breathed out his stout breath at her
and she must bear it as she could for he would eat of
what he liked. and now that he was full of health again
and free of the sickness of his love he could go to her
and be finished with her and turn himself to other things.

^so these two women took their place in his house:
lotus for his toy and his pleasure and to satisfy his delight
in beauty a

er is rich and mine was poor, and there is no
need for his labour, for i have labour in my fields, and
besides, one cannot take a scholar such as my son is and
set him to the plough.'

and he was secretly proud that he had a son like this
. and so he said to o-lan:

' well, and if he is like a young lord it is another matter.
but i cannot buy a slave for him. i will betroth him and
we will marry him early, and there is that to be done.'

then he rose and went into the inner court.

now lotus, seeing wang lung distraught in
her presence and thinking of things other than her beauty,
pouted and said:

'if i had known that in a short year you could look
at me and not see me, i would have stayed in the tea-house.'
and she turned her head away as she spoke and looked at
him out of the corner of her eyes so that he laughed and

180



seized her \ hand and he put it against his face and smelled j
of its fragrance and he answered : _j

' well, and a man cannot always think of the jewel he

ow his
blood is restless with desire and he must be wed and i do
hot know how to find the one he should wed. i am not
willing that he marry any of the daughters of the village
farmers, nor is it meet, seeing that we bear the common
name of wang. yet i do not know one in the town well
enough to say to him, "here is my son and there is your
daughter," and i am loath to go to a professional match-
maker, lest there be some bargain she had made with a
man who has a daughter deformed or idiot.'

now lotus, since the eldest son had grown tall and
graceful with young manhood, looked on the lad with fa-
vour and she was diverted with what wang lung said to
her and she replied, musing:

'there was a man who used to come in to me at the
great tea-house, and he often spoke of his daughter, be-
cause he said she was such an one as i, small and fine,
but still only a child, and he said, "and i love you with a
strange unease as though you were my daughter; you are
too like her, and it troubles me for it

ate flower.'

'what sort of man was this?' asked wang lung.

'he was a good man and his silver was ready and he 1
did not promise without paying. we all wished him well,
for he was not begrudging, and if a girl was weary some- f
times he did not bawl out as some did that he had been
cheated, but he always said courteously as might a prince
or might some from a learned and noble house, "well, and
here is the silver, and rest, my child, until love blooms
again." he spoke very prettily to us.' and lotus mused
until wang lung said hastily to waken her, for he did not
like her to think on her old life:

'what was his business, then, with all this silver?'

and she answered:

'now and i do not know but i think he was master of

181



a grain market, but i will ask cuckoo who knows every-
thing about men and their money.'

then she clapped her hands and cuckoo ran in from
the kitchen, her high cheeks and nose flushed with the fire,
and lotus asked her:

'who was that great, large, goodly man who 
 
 ___________________________
 
t is where i sell my grain, and it is a
propitious thing and surely it can be done,' and for the
first time his interest was awake, because it seemed to him
a lucky thing to wed his son to the daughter of the man
who bought his grain.

w r hen there was a .thing to be done, cuckoo smelled
the money in it as a rat smells tallow, and she wiped her
hands upon her apron and she said quickly :

'i am ready to serve the master.'

wang lung was doubtful, and doubting, he looked at
her crafty face, but lotus said gaily:

'and that is true, and cuckoo shall go and ask the man
liu, and he knows her well and the thing can be done, for
cuckoo is clever enough, and if it is well done she shall
have the matchmaker's fee.'

'that will i do!' said cuckoo heartily and she laughed
as she thought of the fee of good silver on her palm, and
she untied her apron from her waist and she said busily,
'now and at once will i go, for the meat is ready except
for the moment of cooking and the vegetables are washed.'

but wang lung had not pondered the matter sufficient-
ly and it was not to be decided so quickly as this and he
called out :



182



'no, and i have decided nothing. i must think of the
matter for some days and i will tell you what i think.'

the women were impatient, cuckoo for the silver and
lotus because it was a new thing and she would hear
something new to amuse her: but wang lung went out,
saying :

c no, it is my son and i will wait.'

and so he might have waited for many days, thinking
of this and that, had not the lad, his eldest son, come
home one day in the dawn with his face hot and red with
wine drinking, and his breath was fetid and his feet un-
steady. wang lung heard him stumbling in the court and
he ran out to see who it was, and the lad was sick and
vomited before him, fo

ng, what had
happened, and his uncle only laughed and he said:

'well, and can you keep a boy from becoming a man?
and can you keep a young dog from a stray bitch?'

when wang lung heard this laughter he remembered
in one crowded space of time all that he had endured
because of his uncle; how of old his uncle had tried to
force him to the selling of his land, and how they lived
here, these three, eating and drinking and idle, and how
his wife's uncle ate of the expensive foods cuckoo bought
for lotus, and now how his uncle's son had spoiled his own
fair lad, and he bit his tongue between his teeth and he said :

'now out of my house, you and yours, and no more
rice will there be for any of you from this hour, and i will
burn the house down rather than have it shelter you, who
have no gratitude even in your idleness!'

but his uncle sat where he was and ate on, now from
this bowl and now from that, and wang lung stood there
bursting with his blood, and when he saw his uncle paid,
no heed to

a little for the rice you eat!'

and wang lung forgot that he had ever had pride in
his son's writing and in his cleverness at books, and he

flung himself out, stamping his bare feet as he walked and
spitting upon the floor coarsely, because the fineness of his
son angered him for the moment. and the lad stood and
looked at him with hatred, but wang lung would not turn
back to see what the lad did.

nevertheless, that night when wang lung went into
the inner courts and sat beside lotus as she lay upon the
mat on her bed, where cuckoo fanned her as she lay,
lotus said to him idly as of a thing of no account, but only
•something to say:

'that big lad of yours is pining and desires to go away.'

then wang lung, remembering his anger against his
son, said sharply:

'well, and what is it to you? i will not have him in these
rooms at his age.'

but lotus made haste to reply, 'no — no — it is cuckoo
who says it.' and cuckoo made haste to say. 'any one
can see the thing and a

lovely lad he is and too big for
idleness and longing.'

wang lung was led aside by this and he thought only
of his anger against his son and he said :

'no, and he shall not go. i will not spend my money
foolishly.' and he would not speak of it any more and
lotus saw he was peevish from some anger, and she sent
cuckoo away and suffered him there alone.

then for many days there was nothing said and the
lad seemed suddenly content again, but he would not go
to school any more and this wang lung allowed him, for
the boy was nearly eighteen and large like his mother in
frame of bones, and he read in his own room when his
father came into the house and wang lung was content
and he thought to himself:

'it was a whim of his youth and he does not know what
he

 wants, and there are only three years — it may be a
little extra silver will make it two, or even one, if the silver
is enough. one of these days when the harvests are well
over and the winter wheat planted and the beans hoed, i
will see to it.'

then wang lung forgot his son, for the harvests, ex-
cept what the locusts had consumed, were fair enough and

194



by now he had gained once more -what he had spent on
the woman lotus. his gold and his silver were precious to
him once more, and at times he marvelled secretly to him-
self that he had ever spent so freely upon a woman.

still, there were times when she stirred him sweetly, if
not so strongly as at first, and he was proud to own her,
although he saw well enough that what his uncle's wife had
said was true, that she was none too young for all her
smallness of stature, and she never conceived to bear a
child for him. but for this he cared nothing, since he had
so

ns and daughters, and he was willing enough to keep her
for the pleasure she gave him.

as for lotus, she grew lovelier as her fullness of years
came on, for if before she had had a fault, it was her bird-
like thinness that made too sharp the lines of her little
pointed face and hollowed too much her temples. but
now, under the food which cuckoo cooked for her, and
under the idleness of her life with one man only, she be-
came soft and rounded in body, and her face grew full
and smooth at the temples, and with her wide eyes and
small mouth she looked more than ever like a plump little
cat. an

d she slept and ate and took on her body this soft,
smooth flesh. if she was no longer the lotus bud, neither
was she more than the full-blown, flower and if she was
not young, neither did she look old, and youth and age
were equally far from her.

with his life placid again and the lad content., wang
lung might have been satisfied except that one night when
he sat late and alone, reckoning on his fingers what he
could sell of his corn and what he could sell of his rice^j
o-lan came softly into the room. this one, with the passing
of the years had grown lean and gaunt and the rock-like
pon

these three
years, only there was no birth. but she rose at dawn and /



she did her work and wang lung saw only as he saw



the table or his chair or* a tree in the court, never even so
keenly as he might see one of the oxen drooping its head

or a pig that would not eat. and she did her work alone
and spoke no more than she could escape speaking with
the wife of wang lung's uncle, and she never spoke at all
to cuckoo. never once had o-lan gone into the inner
courts, and rarely, if lotus came out to walk a little in a
place other than her own court, o-lan went into her room
and sat until one said, 4 she is gone.' and she said nothing
but she worked at her cooking and at the washing at the
pool even in the winter when the water was stiff with ice
to be broken. but wang lung never thought to say:

'well, and why do you not with the silver i have to
spare, hire a servant or buy a slave?'

it did not occur to him that there was any need of this,
although he hired labourers for his

ble and took
his bowl of tea and felt of it and spilled the cool tea on
the brick floor and filled the bowl again from the hot pot,
and as she came she went, silent, and left him sitting there
agape.

well, and this woman, she was jealous he said to him-
self. well and he would not trouble about this, with his
lad content and reading every day in his own room, and
he rose and laughed and put it away from him, laughing
at the small thoughts of women.

but when he went in that night to lie beside lotus and
when he turned upon the bed she complained and was
petulant and she pushed him away saying:

'it is hot and you stink and i wish you would wash
yourself before you come to lie beside me.'

she sat up, then, and pushed her hair fretfully back
from her face and she shrugged her shoulders when he
would have drawn her to him, and she would not yield to
his coaxing. then he lay still and he remembered that she
had yielded unwillingly these many nights, and he had
thought it her whim and the heav

ly and he rose up roughly and said :

'well, and sleep alone then, and cut my throat if i care!'

he flung himself out of the room and strode into the
middle room of his own house and he put two chairs to-
gether and stretched himself on them. but he could not
sleep and he rose and v/ent out of his gate and he walked
among the bamboos beside the house wall, and there he
felt the cool night wind upon his hot flesh, and there was
the coolness of coming autumn in it.

then he remembered this, that lotus had known of
his son's desire to go away, and how had she known?
and he remembered that of late his son had said nothing
of going away but had been content, and why was he con-
tent? and wang lung said to his heart, fiercely:

'i will see the thing for myself!'

and he watched the dawn come ruddy out of a mist
over his land.



197



when the dawn was come and the sun showed a gold
rim over the edge of the fields, he went in and he ate, and
then he went out to oversee his men as his custom was

 road on a hillock
of grass that was an old grave, now forgotten, and he
plucked a grass and twisted it in his fingers and he medi-
tated. facing him were the small gods and on the surface
of his mind he noted how they stared at him and how of
old he had been afraid of them, but now he was careless,
having become prosperous and in no need of gods, so that
he scarcely saw them. underneath he thought to himself,
over and over:

'shall l'go back?'

then suddenly he remembered the night before when
lotus had pushed him away, and he was angry because
of all he had done for her and he said to himself :

'well i know that she would not have lasted many
years more at the tea-house, and in my house she is fed
and clothed richly.'

and in the strength of his anger he rose and he strode
back to his house by another way and he went secretly
into his house and stood at the curtain that hung in the
door to the inner court. and listening, he heard the mur-
muring of a man's voice, and it was the voice of

 who steals away the loved
woman, and when wang lung remembered that the other
man was his own son, he was filled with a vomiting sickness.

he set his teeth then, and he went out and chose a slim,
supple, bamboo from the grove and he ripped off the
branches, except for a cluster of small branches at the top,
thin and hard as cord, and he ripped off the leaves. then
he went in softly, and suddenly he tore aside the curtain
and there was his son, standing in the court, and looking
down at lotus, who sat on a small stool at the edge of the
pool. and lotus was dressed in her peach-coloured silk
coat, such as he had never seen her dressed in by the light
of the morning.

these two talked together, and the woman laughed
lightly and looked at the young man from the corner of
her eyes, her head turned aside, and they did not hear
wang lung. he stood and stared at them, his face whitening
and his lips lifted back and snarling from his teeth, and
his hands tightened about the bamboo. and stil

did not hear him and would not, except that the woman
cuckoo came out and saw him and shrieked and they saw.

then wang lung leaped forward and he fell on his son,
lashing him, and although the lad was taller than he, he
was stronger from his labour in the fields and from the
robustness of his mature body, and he beat the lad until
the blood streamed down. when lotus screamed and drag-
ged at his arm he shook her off, and when she persisted,
screaming, he beat her also and he beat her until she fled
and he beat the young man until he stopped cowering to
the ground, and covered his torn face in his hands.

then wang lung paused and his breath whistled through
his parted lips and the sweat poured down his body until
he was drenched and he was weak as though with an
illness. he threw down his bamboo and he whispered to
the boy, panting:

'now get you to your r

oom and do not dare to come
out of it until i am rid of you, lest i kill you!'

and the boy rose without a word and went out.

wang lung sat on the stool where lotus had sat and
he put his head in his hands and closed his eyes and his
breath came and went in great gasps. no one drew near
him and he sat thus alone until he was quieted and his
anger gone.

then he rose wearily and he went into the room and
lotus lay there on her bed, weeping aloud, and he went
up to her and he turned her over, and she lay looking at
him and weeping and there on her face lay the swollen
purple mark of his whip.

and he said to her with great sadness:

'so you must ever be a whore and go a-whoring after
my own sons!'

and she cried more loudly at this and protested:

'no, but i did not, and the lad was lonely and came
in and you may ask cuckoo if he ever came nearer to my
bed than you saw him in the court!'

then she loo

reached for his hand and drew it across the welt on her
face and she whimpered :

'see what you have done to your lotus — and there
is no man in the world except you, and if it is your son,
it is only your son, and what is he to me!'

she looked up at him, her pretty eyes swimming in
her clear tears, and he groaned because this woman's
beauty was more than he could wish and he loved her
when he would not. and it seemed to him suddenly that
he could not bear to know what had passed between these
two and he wished never to know and it was better for
him if he did not. so he groaned again and he went out.

tale x _and
wang lung was stabbed at hearing this, that o-lan had
told the child he did not love her who was the child's
' mother, and he said quickly:

j 'well, and to-day i have heard of a pretty husband for
1 you, and we will see if cuckoo can arrange the matter.'
r then the child smiled and dropped her head, suddenly
a maid and no more a child. and wang lung said to
cuckoo on that same evening when he was in the inner
court :

p" 'go and see if it can be done.'

but he slept uneasily beside lotus that night and he
j woke and fell to thinking of his life of how o-lan had
been the first woman he had known and how she had
been a faithful servant beside him. and he thought of
what the child said, and he was sad, because with all her
dimness o-lan had seen the truth in him.

in the near days after this he sent his second son away
into the town and he signed the papers for the second
girl's betrothal and the dowry was decided upon and the
gifts of clothing and jewellery for her marriage day w

woman who had borne
them to him.

for the fir^t time in his years with her wang lung
began to think about o-lan. even in the days of her new-
coming he had not thought of her for herself and not j
further than because she was a woman and the first he,
had known. and it seemed to him that with this thing!
and that he had been busy and without time to spare, and ;
only now, when his children were settled and his fields '
cared for arid quiet under the coming of winter, and now,
when his life with lotus was regulated and she was sub-
missive to him since he had beat her, now it seemed to
him he had time to think of what he would and he thought
of o-lan.

he looked at her, not because she was woman this
time, and not that she was ugly and gaunt and yellow-
skinned. but he looked at her with some strange remorse,
and he saw that she had grown thin and her skin was
sere and yellow. she had always been a dark woman, her
skin tuddy and brown when she worked in the fields.
yet now for many years she

again and again, 'well i know i am ugly and cannot be
loved '

when she said this wang lung could not bear it and
he took her hand and he soothed it, a big hard hand, stiff
as though it were dead already. and he wondered and \
grieved at himself most of all because what she said was(
true, and even he took her hand, desiring truly that she\
feel his tenderness towards her, he was ashamed because j
he could feel no tenderness, no melting of the heart such,
as lotus could win from him with a pout of her lips, i
when he took this* stiff dying hand he did not love it, andl
even his pity was spoiled with repulsion towards it.

and because of this, he was more kind to her and he
bought her special food and delicate soups made of white
fish and the hearts of young cabbages. moreover, he could
not take his pleasure of lotus, for when he went in to her
to distract his mind from its despair over this long agony
of dying, he could not forget o-lan, and even as he h

eld
lotus, he loosed her, because of o-lan.

there were times when o-lan woke to herself and to
what was about her and once she called for cuckoo, and
when in great astonishment wang lung summoned the
woman, o-lan raised herself trembling upon her arm, and
she said plainly enough:

'well, and you may have lived in the courts of the
old lord, and you were accounted beautiful, but i have
been a man's wife and i have borne him sons, and you
are still a slave.'

when cuckoo would have answered angrily to thi

eart burst with pride to see his son, and he
forgot everything except this, his goodly son, and he led
him to his mother.

then the young man sat beside his mother's bed and
the tears stood in his eyes to see her thus, but he would
not say anything except cheerful things such as these, 'you
look twice as well as they said and years away from death.'
but o-lan said simply:

£ i will see you wed and then i must die.'

now the maid who was to be wed must not of course
be seen by the young man and lotus took her into the
inner court to prepare her for marriage, and none could do
this better than lotus and cuckoo and the wife of wang
lung's uncle. these three took the maid and on the morn-
ing of her wedding-day they washed her clean from head
to foot, and bound her feet freshly with new white cloths
under her new stockings, and lotus rubbed into her flesh

some fragrant almond oil of her own. then they dressed
her in garments she had brought from her home; white
flowered silk next her

 with the silence over the house and with the
ebbing of merriment strength passed from o-lan and she
grew weary and faint and she called to her the two who
had been wed that day and she said:

'now i am content and this thing in me may do as it ]
will. my son, look to your father and your grandfather,
and my daughter, look to your husband and your husband's i
father and his grandfather and the poor fool in the court,
there is she. and you have no duty to any other.'

this last she said, meaning lotus, to whom she had
never spoken. then she seemed to fall into a fitful sleep, i
although they waited for her to speak further, and once
more she roused herself to speak. yet when she spoke it
was as though she did not know they were there or indeed
where she was, for she said, muttering and turning her $
head this way and that and her eyes closed:

'well, and if i am ugly, still i have borne a son; although
i am but a slave there is a son in my house.' and again f i
she said, suddenly. 'how can t

then wang lung was scrupulous to do all that should
be done for the one dead, so he caused mourning to be
made for himself and for his children, and their shoes were
made of coarse white cloth, which is the colour of mourning,
and about their ankles they bound bands of white cloth,
and the women in the house bound their hair with white
cord.

after this wang lung could not bear to sleep in the
room where o-lan had died and he took his possessions
and moved altogether into the inner court where lotus
lived and he said to his eldest son :

'go with your wife into that room where your mother
lived and died, who conceived and bore you, and beget
there your own sons.'

218



so the two moved into it and were content.

then as though death could not easily leave the house
where it had come once, the old man, wang lung's father,

the stiff dead body of o-lan into the coffin, lay down on
his bed one night for sleeping, and when the second daug

 lung dressed himself in a
robe of white sack-cloth and he gave a robe like it to his
uncle and his uncle's son, and to his own sons each a robe,
and to his son's wife and to his own two daughters. he
called chairs from the town to carry them, for it was not
meet that they walk to the place of burial as though he
were a poor man and a common fellow. so for the first
time he rode on men's shoulders and behind the coffin
where o-lan was. but behind his father's coffin his uncle
i rode first. even lotus, who in o-lan's lifetime could not
appear before her, now that o-lan was dead, came riding
jin a chair in order that before others she might appear
\ dutiful to the first wife of her husband. so for his uncle's
wife and for his uncle's son, wang lung hired chairs also
and for all of them he had robes of sackcloth, and even
for the poor fool he made a robe and hired a chair and
put her in it, although she was sorely bewildered and laugh-
ed shrilly when there should have been only weeping.

than he had done.

s 1 but when the earth was covered over and the graves

chair and he walked home alone with himself. and out of
! his heaviness there stood out strangely but one clear thought
i and it was a pain to him, and it was this : that he wished
i he had not taken the two pearls from o-lan that day when
i she was washing his clothes at the pool, and he would
never bear to see lotus put them in her ears again.

thus, thinking heavily, he went on alone and he said
to himself:

pthere n that land of mine is buried the first good half
i of my life and more. it is as though half of me were buried
there, and now it is a. different life in my house/ t

and suddenly he wept a little, and he dried his eyes
with the back of his hand, as a child does.

the winter came except what he said, and he husbanded
carefully all that they had. every day he gave out to his
daughter-in-law what food was needed in the house for that
day, and to ching he gave out what the labourers should
have, although it hurt him to feed idle men, and it hurt |
him so greatly that at last when winter cold came and the
water froze over, he bade the men begone to the south to
beg and to labour until the spring came when they might
return to him. only to lotus he gave secretly sugar and
oil, because she was not accustomed to hardship. even on
the new year they did eat but a fish they caught them-
selves in the lake and a pig they killed from the farm,

now wang lung was not so poor as he wished to seem,
for he had good silver hidden away in the walls where his
son slept with his wife, though his son and daughter-in-law
did not know it, and he had good silver and even some
gold hidden in a jar at the bottom of the lake under his
nearest field,

 not need it yet?' take it then, and smoke it when
you wish or when you have a little pain.'

then wang lung's uncle took it greedily, for it was
sweet to smell and a thing that only rich men used, and
he took it and bought a pipe and he smoked the opium,
lying all day upon his bed to do it. then wang lung
saw to it that there were pipes bought and left here and
there and he pretended to smoke himself, but he only took
a pipe to his room and left it there cold. and his two sons
in the house and lotus he would not allow to touch the
opium, saying as his excuse that it was too dear, but he
urged it upon his uncle and upon his uncle's wife and son,
and the courts were filled with the sweetish smell of the
smoke, and the silver for this wang lung did not begrudge
because it bought him peace.

now as the winter wore away and the waters began to
recede so that wang lung could walk abroad over his
land it happened one day that his eldest son followed him
and said to him proudly:

'well, and there

hen they had nothing wherewith to buy seed and ploughs
and oxen, they sold their daughters, and there were those
who came to wang lung to sell, because it was known he
was rich and powerful and a man of good heart.

and he, thinking constantly of the child to come and
of others to come from his sons when they were all wed,
bought five slaves, two about twelve years of age with big
feet and strong bodies, and two younger to wait upon them
all and fetch and carry, and one to wait on the person of
lotus, for cuckoo grew old and since the second girl was

231



gone there had been none other to work in the house.
and the five he bought in one day, for he was a man rich
enough to do quickly what he decided upon.

then one day many days later a man came bearing a
small, delicate maid of seven years or so, wanting to sell
her, and wang lung said he would not have her at first,
for she was so small and weak. but lotus saw her and
fancied her and she said pettishly :

'now this one 1 will have beca
 
 ___________________________
 
use she is so pretty and
the other one is coarse and smells like goat's meat and i
do not like her.'

and wang lung looked at the child and saw her pretty
frightened eyes and her piteous thinness and he said partly
to humour lotus and partly that he might see the child
fed and fattened:

' well, and let it be so if you wish it.'

so he bought the child for twenty pieces of silver and
she lived in the inner courts and slept on the foot of the
bed where lotus slept.

now it seemed to wang lung that he could have peace
in his house. when the waters receded and summer came
and the land was to be planted to good seed, he walked
hither and thither and looked at every piece and he discussed
with ching the quality of each piece of soil and what change
there should be of crops for the fertility of the land. and
whenever he went he took with him his youngest son, who
was to be on the land after him, that the lad might learn.
and wang lung never looked to se
 
 ___________________________
 
 lung's eldest son could never
give over his hatred of his cousin or his deep suspicion
of his cousin's evil. he had seen well enough with his
own eyes in his youth that the man, his cousin, was full of
all sorts of evil, and things had come to a pass where
wang lung's son would not even leave the house to go to
the tea-shop unless the cousin went also, and he watched
the cousin and left only when he left. and he suspected
the man of evil with the slaves and even of evil in the
inner court with lotus, although this was idle, for lotus
grew fatter and older every day and had long since given
over caring for anything except her foods and her wines
and would not have troubled to look at the man had he
come near, and she was even glad when wang lung came
to her less and less with his age.

now when wang lung entered with his youngest son
from the fields, his eldest son drew his father aside and
he said :

'i will not endure that fellow my cousin in the house
any more with his peepings and his l

hese days when wang lung had decided aj
thing he could not do it quickly enough. as he grew
older he grew impatient to have done with things and to sit in ]
the latter part of the day at peace and idle and to watch
the late sun and sleep a little after he had strolled about his
land. so he told his elder son what he had decided and he
commanded the young man to arrange the matter, and
he sent for his second son to come and help with the moving
and on a day when they were ready they moved, first lotus
and cuckoo and their slaves and goods, and then wang
lung's eldest son and his wife and their servants and the j
slaves.

but wang lung himself would not go. at once, and he
kept with him his youngest son. when the moment came
for leaving the land whereon he was born he could not do
it easily nor so quickly as he had thought and he said to
his sons when they urged him:

' well then, prepare a court for me to use alone and on |
a day that i wish i will come, and it will be a day before my j

reproach and he said mildly:

'i will come when the maid is found who is to wed /
the second son, for it is easier to stay here where ching is
until the matter in completed.'

the second son, therefore, gave over his urging.

there was left in the house, then, none but the uncle
and his wife and son and ching and the labouring men,
besides wang lung and his youngest son and the fool.
and the uncle and his wife and son moved into the inner
courts where lotus had been and they took it for their
own, but this did not grieve wang lung unduly, for he
saw clearly there were not many days of life left for his
uncle and when the idle old man was dead wang lung's
duty to that generation was over and if the younger man
did not do as he was told none would blame wang lung
if he cast him out. then ching moved into the outer
rooms and the laboures with him, and wang lung and
his son and the fool lived in the middle rooms, and wang
lung hired a stout woman to b

with good wheaten bread wrapped about a stick of garlic,
now that he slept late in the day and did not work with
his own hands on the land, was not easily pleased with this
dish and that, and he tasted winter bamboo and shrimps'
rose and southern fish and shellfish from the northern seas
and pigeons' eggs and all those things which rich men use
to force their lagging appetites. and his son's ate and lotus

also, and cuckoo, seeing all that had come about, laughed
and said:

'well, and it is like the old days when i was in these
courts, only this body of mine is withered and dried now
and not fit even for an old lord.

saying this, she glanced slyly at wang lung and laughed
again, and he pretended not to hear her lewdness, but he
was pleased, nevertheless, that she had compared him to
the old lord.

so with this idle and luxurious living and rising when
they would and sleeping when they

t, and he sat down at his table and he
wished for a slave to bring him tea and for another to
bring him a towel dipped and wrung from steaming water
to wipe his face, but though he clapped his hands none
came. no one heeded him, and there was running to and
fro, but he dared to stop no one to ask what sort of a
child had been born or even if any had been born. he
sat there dusty and spent and no one spoke to him.

then at last, when it seemed to him it must soon be
night, so long he had waited, lotus came, in waddling upon
her small feet because of her great weight and leaning upon
cuckoo, and she laughed and said joudly:

£ well, and there is a son in the house of your son, and
both mother and son are alive. i have seen the child and
it is fair and sound.'

then wang lung laughed also and he rose and he
slapped his hands together and laughed again and he said :

'well, and i have been sitting here like a man with
his own first son coming and not knowing what to do of
this and that and afr

aid of everything.'

and then when lotus had gone on to her room and
he sat again he fell to musing and he thought to himself:

'well, and i did not fear like this when that other one
bore her first, my son.' and he sat silent and musing and
he remembered within himself that day and how she had
gone alone into the small dark room and how alone she
had borne him sons and again sons and daughters and she
bore them silently, and how had come to the fields and
worked beside him again. and here was this one, now the
wife of his son, who cr

n the gift, one
came running from the harvest fields to tell him that ching
lay dying suddenly and had asked if wang lung would
come to see him die. wang lung, hearing the panting
runner, cried angrily:

'now i suppose that accursed pair in the temple are
jealous because i gave a red robe to a town goddess and
i suppose they do not know they have no power over child-
birth and only over , land.'

and although his noon meal stood ready for him to eat
he would not take up his chopsticks, although lotus called
loudly to him to wait until after the evening sun came; he
would not stay for her, and he went out. then when lotus
saw he did not heed her she sent a slave after him with an
umbrella of oiled paper, but so fast did wang lung run
that the stout maid had difficulty in holding the umbrella
over his head.

wang lung went at once to the room where ching had
been laid and he called out loudly to any one:

'now how did all this come about?'

the room was full of labourers crowding about and

ner courts and seldom came forth, since he slept and
ate and took his ease as his age came on, and he left the
thing in the hands of his eldest son. and his son called
carpenters and clever masons and they repaired the rooms
and the moon gates between the courts that the common
people had ruined with their coarse ways of living, and he
built again the pools and he bought flecked and golden
fish to put in them. and after it was all finished and made
beautiful as far as he knew beauty, he planted lotus and
lilies in the pools, and the scarlet-berried bamboo of india

and everything he could remember he had seen in southern
parts. and his wife came out to see what he had done
and the two of them walked about through every court and
room and she saw this and that still lacking, and he listened i
with great heed to all she said, that he might do it. — *
then people on the streets of the town heard of all
that wang lung's eldest son did, and they talked of what
was being done in the gr

bowed before him and his wife as their elder
brother and sister. and the wife of the eldest son was
correct and haughty and bowed only the least that could
be considered proper for her position.

now of all of them who lived in these courts it seemed
there was none wholly at peace and comfortable there
except the small grandson who had been born to wang
lung. even wang lung himself, waking within the shadows
of the great carved bed where he slept in his own room
that was next to the court where lotus lived, even he woke
to dream sometimes that he was back in the simple, dark,
earth-walled house where a man could throw his cold tea
down where he would not splatter a piece of carven wood,
and where a step took him into his own fields.

as for wang lung's sons, there was continual unrest,
the eldest son lest not enough be spent and they be be-
littled in the eyes of men and lest the villagers come walking
through the great gate when a man from the town was
there to call, and so make them asham

move on to other parts
before long!'

then the three of them looked at each other heavily,
and thought of their women and of these lusty, hungry
men. and the eldest son thought of his goodly, proper
wife, and he said :

c we must put the women together in the innermost
court and we must watch there day and night and keep
the gates barred and the back gate of peace ready to be
loosed and opened/

thus they did. they took the women and the children
and they put them all into the inner court where lotus
had lived alone with cuckoo and her maids, and there in
discomfort and crowding they lived. the eldest son and
wang lung watched the gate day and night and the
second son came when he could, and they watched as
carefully by night as by day.

but there was that one, the cousin, and because he was

264



a relative none could lawfully keep him out and he beat
on the gate and he would come in and he walked about
at will, carrying his knife shining and glittering and open
in his hand. the eldest s

on followed him about, his face
full of bitterness, but still not daring to say anything, for
there was the knife open and glittering, and the cousin
looked at this and that and appraised each woman.

he looked at the wife of the eldest son and he laughed
his hoarse laugh and he said:

c well, and it is a proper dainty bit you have, my cousin,
a town lady and her feet as small as lotus buds!' and to
the wife of the second son he said, 'well, here is a good
stout red radish from the country — a piece of sturdy red
meat!'

this he said because the woman was fat and ruddy and
thick in the bone, but still not uncomely. and whereas the
wife of the eldest son shrank away when he looked at her
and hid her face behind her sleeve, this one laughed out,
good humoured and robust as she was, and she answered
pertly :

'well, and some men like a taste of hot radish, or a
bite of red mea

even to speak to each other, and he glanced at his wife
because he was ashamed of his cousin and of his sister-in-
law before her who had been more gently bred than he,
and his cousin saw his timidity before his wife and said
w t ith malice:

'well, and i had rather eat red meat any day than a
slice of cold and tasteless fish like this other one!'

at this the wife of the eldest son rose in dignity and
withdrew herself into an inner room. then the cousin
laughed coarsely and he said to lotus, who sat there
smoking her water pipe:

'these town women are too finicking, are they not,
old mistress?' then he looked at lotus attentively and
he said: 'well, and old mistress indeed, and if i did not

know my cousin wang lung were rich i should know
by looking at you, such a mountain of flesh you have
become, and well you have eaten and how richly! it is
only rich men's wives who can look like you!'

now lotus was mightily pleased that he called her old
mistress, because it is a titl

 cuckoo go and ask the cousin what slave
he would have since he had seen them all.

so cuckoo did, then, and she came back and she said:

'he says he will have the little pale one who sleeps on
the bed of the mistress.'

now this pale slave was called pear blossom and the
one wang lung had bought in a famine year when she
was small and piteous and half-starved, and because she

267



was delicate always they had petted her and allowed her
only to help cuckoo and to do the lesser things about i
lotus, filling her pipe and pouring her tea, and it was thus i
the cousin had seen her.

now when pear blossom heard this she cried out as
she poured the tea for lotus, for cuckoo said it all out
before them in the inner court where they sat, and she
dropped the pot and it broke into pieces on the tiles and
the tea all streamed out, but the maid did not see what
she had done. she only threw herself down before lotus
and she knocked her head on the tiles and she moaned
forth:

'oh, my mistress, not i

— not i — i am afraid of him for
my life '

and lotus was displeased with her and she answered
pettishly:

'now he is only a man and a man is no more than a
man with a maid and they are all alike, and what is this
ado?' and he turned to cuckoo and said, 'take this slave
and give her to him.'

then the young maid put her hands together piteously
and cried as though she would die of weeping and fear
and her little body was all trembling with her fear, and
she looked from this face to that, beseeching with her
weeping.

now the sons of wang lung coul

their father's wife, nor could their wives speak if they did
not, nor could the youngest son, but he stood there staring
at her, his hands clenched on his bosom and his brows
drawn down over his eyes, straight and black. but he did
not speak. the children and the slaves looked and were
silent, and there was only the sound of this dreadful,
frightened weeping of the young girl.

but wang lung was made uncomfortable by it, and
he looked at the young girl doubtfully, not caring to anger
lotus but still moved, because he had always a soft heart.
then the maid saw his heart in his face and she ran and
held his feet with her hands and she bent her head down
to his feet and wept on in great sobs. and he looked
down at her and saw how small her shoulders were and



268



how they shook and he remembered the great, coarse, wild
body of his cousin, now long past his youth, and a distaste
for the thing seized him and he said to cuckoo, his voice

' well now, it is ill to force the young m

aid like this.'
these words he said mildly enough, but lotus cried

out sharply: .

'she is to do as she is told, and i say it is foolish, all this
weeping over a small thing that must happen soon or late
with all women.'

but wang lung was indulgent and he said to lotus :

'let us see first what else can be done, and let me buy
for you another slave if you will, or what you will, but let
me see what can be done.'

then lotus, who had long been minded for a toreign
clock and a new ruby ring, was suddenly silent and wang
lung said to cuckoo : .

'go and tell my cousin the girl has a vile and incur-
able disease, but if he will have her with that, then well
enough and she shall come to him, but if he fears it as
we all do, then tell him we have another and a sound ,

oi1 and he cast his eyes over the slaves who stood about
and they turned away their faces and giggled and made as
if they were ashamed, all except one st

he said with her face red and

k " well! 'and i have heard enough of this thing and i
have a mind to try it, if he will have me, and he is not so
hideous a man as some.'

then wang lung answered in relief:

'well, go then!'

and cuckoo said: •
'follow close behind me, for it will happen i know,
that he will seize the fruit nearest to him.' and they

went out. , c , i

but the little maid still clung to wang lung s feet, only
now she ceased her weeping and lay listening to what took
place. and lotus was still angry with her, and she rose
and went into her room without a word. then wang lung

269



raised the maid gently and she stood before him, drooping
and pale, and he saw that she had a little soft, oval face,
egg-shaped, exceedingly delicate and pale, and a little pale
red mouth. and he said kindly:

'now keep away from your mistress for a day or two,
my child, until she is past her anger, and when that other
one comes in, hide, lest he desire you again.'

and she lifted her eyes and

he money passed through
his hands, so that although wang lung received and
dispensed all the moneys from his lands, still the second
brother knew what it was and the elder did not, but must

go and ask his father for this and that like a child. so when
the two wives hated each other, their hatred spread to the
men also and the courts of the two were full of anger ,
and wang lung groaned because there was no peace in
his house.

wang lung had also his own secret trouble with lotus
since the day when he had protected her slave from the
son of his uncle. ever since that day the young maid had
been in disfavour with lotus, and although the girl waited
on her silently and slavishly, and stood by her side all day
filling her pipe and fetching this and that, and rising in
the night at her complaint that she was sleepless and rub-
bing her legs and her body to soothe her, still lotus was
not satisfied.

and she was jealous of the maid and she sent her from
the room when wang lu
 
 ___________________________
 
ng came in and she accused wang
lung that he looked at the maid. now wang lung had
not thought of the girl except as a poor small child who
was frightened and he cared as he might care for his poor
fool and no more. but when lotus accused him he took
thought to look and he saw it was true that the girl was
very pretty and pale as a pear blossom, and seeing this,
something stirred in his old blood that had been quiet
these ten years and more.

so while he laughed at lotus saying: 'what — are_y.au
thinking i am still a-lust, when i do not come into your
room thrice a year?' yet he looked sidelong at the girl
and he was stirred.

now lotus, for all she was ignorant in all ways except
the one, was learned in the way of men with women and
she knew that men when they are old will wake once again
to a brief youth, and so she was angry with the maid and
she talked of selling her to the tea-house. but still lotus
loved her comfort and cuckoo grew old and lazy and the

 
 ___________________________
 
maid was quick and used about the person of lotus and
saw what her mistress needed before she knew it herself,
and so lotus was loath to part with her and yet she would
part with her, and in this unaccustomed conflict lotus was
the more angry because of her discomfort and she was



274



more hard than usual to live with. wang lung stayed
away from her court for many days at a time because her
temper was too ill to enjoy. he said to himself that he
would wait, thinking it would pass, but meanwhile he
thought of the pretty pale young maid more than he him-
self would believe he did. ~

then, as though there was not enough trouble with the
women of his house all awry, there was wang lung's
youngest son. now his yo

full and hot like the blood of a young man.
through the day he had felt his blood so and he had
been of half a mind to walk out on his land and feel the
good earth under his feet and take off" his shoes and his
stockings and feel it on his skin.
f this he would have done but he was ashamed lest men
\ see him, who was no longer held a farmer within the
.gates of the town, but a landowner and a rich man. so
he wandered restlessly about the courts and he stayed away
altogether from the court where lotus sat in the shade and
smoked her water pipe, because well she knew when a man
was restless and she had sharp eyes to see what was amiss.
he went alone, then, and he had no mind to see either of
his two quarrelling daughters-in-law, nor even his grand-
children, in whom was his frequent delight.

so the day had passed very long and lonely and his
blood was full and coursing under his skin. he could not
forget his youngest son, how he had looked standing tall
and straight and his black brows drawn

hly and half proudly and he said muttering:

'well, and i said she had better take a young lad and
she would have the old one!'

'it will be a pretty thing to tell the mistress,' cuckoo
said then, and her eyes sparkled with malice.

'i do not know myself how the thing happened,' an-
swered wang lung slowly. 'i had not meant to add another

280



woman to my courts, and the thing came about of itself.'
then when cuckoo said, 'well, and the mistress must be
told,' wang lung, fearing the anger of lotus more than
anything begged cuckoo and he said again, 'do you tell
her, if you will, and if you can manage it without anger
to my face i will give you a handful of money for it.'

so cuckoo, still laughing and shaking her head, promised,
and wang lung went back to his court and he would
not come forth for a while until cuckoo came back and
said:

'well, and the thing is told, and she was angry enough
until i reminded her she wanted and has wanted this long
time the foreign clock you promised her,
 
 ___________________________
 
 and she will have
a ruby ring for her hand and a pair so that there will be
one on each hand, and she will have other things as she
thinks of them and a slave to take pear blossom's place,
and pear blossom is not to come to her any more, and
you are not to come soon either, because the sight of you
sickens her.'

and wang lung promised eagerly and he said:

'get her what she wills and i do not begrudge anything.'

and he was pleased that he need not see lotus soon
and until anger was cooled with the fulfilment of her wishes.

there were left yet his three sons, and he was strangely
ashamed before them of what he had done. and he said
to himself again and again :

'am i not master in my own house and may i not take
my own slave i bought with my silver?'

but he was ashamed, and yet half proud, too, as one
feels himself who is still lusty and a man when others hold
him to be only grandfather. and he waited for his sons
to come into his court.

they ca

he covered them with her hands and she
whispered :

286



'every man i hate except you — i have hated every man,
even my father who sold me. i have heard only evil of
them and i hate them all.'

and he said wondering:

'now i should have said you had lived quietly and
easily in my courts.'

'i am filled with loathing,' she said, looking away. 'i
am filled with loathing and i hate them all. i hate all
young men.'

and she would say nothing more, and he mused on it,
and he did not know whether lotus had filled her with
tales of her life and threatened her, or w whether cuckoo
had frightened her with lewdness, or whether something
had befallen her secretly that she would not tell him, or
what it was.

but he sighed and gave over his questions, because
above everything now he would have peace, and he wished
only to sit in his court near these two.

so wang lung sat, and so his age came on him day
by day and year by year, and he slept fitfully in the sun
as his father had done, and he said to
 
 ___________________________
 
 himself that his life
was done and he was satisfied with it.

sometimes, but seldom, he went into other courts, and
sometimes, but more seldom, he saw lotus, and she never
mentioned the maid he had taken, but she greeted him
well enough, for she was old too and satisfied with the
food and the wine she loved and with the silver she had
for the asking. she and cuckoo sat together now after
these many years as friends and no longer as mistress and
servant, and they talked of this and that, and most^of all
of the old days with men and they whispered together of
things they would speak aloud, and they ate and drank
