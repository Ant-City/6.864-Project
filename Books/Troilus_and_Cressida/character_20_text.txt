  pandarus. swords! anything, he cares not; an the devil come to him,
    it's all one. by god's lid, it does one's heart good. yonder
    comes paris, yonder comes paris.

                       paris passes

    look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too, is't not? why,
    this is brave now. who said he came hurt home to-day? he's not
    hurt. why, this will do helen's heart good now, ha! would i could
    see troilus now! you shall see troilus anon.

                      helenus passes

  cressida. who's that?
  pandarus. that's helenus. i marvel where troilus is. that's
    helenus. i think he went not forth to-day. that's helenus.
  cressida. can helenus fight, uncle?
  pandarus. helenus! no. yes, he'll fight indifferent well. i marvel
    where troilus is. hark! do you not hear the people cry 'troilus'?
    helenus is a priest.
  cressida. what sneaking fellow comes yonder?

                    troilus passes

  pandarus. where? yonder? that's deiphobus

    will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and troy,
    to-morrow morning, call some knight to arms
    that hath a stomach; and such a one that dare
    maintain i know not what; 'tis trash. farewell.
  ajax. farewell. who shall answer him?
  achilles. i know not; 'tis put to lott'ry. otherwise. he knew his
    man.
  ajax. o, meaning you! i will go learn more of it.

troy. priam's palace

enter priam, hector, troilus, paris, and helenus

  priam. after so many hours, lives, speeches, spent,
    thus once again says nestor from the greeks:
    'deliver helen, and all damage else-
    as honour, loss of time, travail, expense,
    wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consum'd
    in hot digestion of this cormorant war-
    shall be struck off.' hector, what say you to't?
  hector. though no man lesser fears the greeks than i,
    as far as toucheth my particular,
    yet, dread priam,
    there is no lady of m

 ours, nor worth to us,
    had it our name, the value of one ten,
    what merit's in that reason which denies
    the yielding of her up?
  troilus. fie, fie, my brother!
    weigh you the worth and honour of a king,
    so great as our dread father's, in a scale
    of common ounces? will you with counters sum
    the past-proportion of his infinite,
    and buckle in a waist most fathomless
    with spans and inches so diminutive
    as fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!
  helenus. no marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons,
    you are so empty of them. should not our father
    bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons,
    because your speech hath none that tells him so?
  troilus. you are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;
    you fur your gloves with reason. here are your reasons:
    you know an enemy intends you harm;
    you know a sword employ'd is perilous,
    and reason flies the object of all harm.
    who marvels, then, when helenus

    o ho! groans out for ha! ha! ha!-hey ho!

  helen. in love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.
  paris. he eats nothing but doves, love; and that breeds hot blood,
    and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and hot thoughts beget hot
    deeds, and hot deeds is love.
  pandarus. is this the generation of love: hot blood, hot thoughts,
    and hot deeds? why, they are vipers. is love a generation of
    vipers? sweet lord, who's a-field today?
  paris. hector, deiphobus, helenus, antenor, and all the gallantry
    of troy. i would fain have arm'd to-day, but my nell would not
    have it so. how chance my brother troilus went not?
  helen. he hangs the lip at something. you know all, lord pandarus.
  pandarus. not i, honey-sweet queen. i long to hear how they spend
    to-day. you'll remember your brother's excuse?
  paris. to a hair.
  pandarus. farewell, sweet queen.
  helen. commend me to your niece.
  pandarus. i will, sweet queen.       exit. sound a retr

    o these encounters so glib of tongue
    that give a coasting welcome ere it comes,
    and wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
    to every ticklish reader! set them down

  agamemnon. yonder comes the troop.
  aeneas. hail, all the state of greece! what shall be done
    to him that victory commands? or do you purpose
    a victor shall be known? will you the knights
    shall to the edge of all extremity
    pursue each other, or shall they be divided
    by any voice or order of the field?
    hector bade ask.
  agamemnon. which way would hector have it?
  aeneas. he cares not; he'll obey condit
