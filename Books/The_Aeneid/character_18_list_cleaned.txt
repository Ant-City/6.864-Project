[CHARACTER] - 
                    the
king of the gods, and the son of saturn. while the gods often struggle
against one another in battles of will, [CHARACTER]'s will reigns supreme
and becomes identified with the more impersonal force of fate. therefore,
[CHARACTER] (also known as jove, and called zeus in greek mythology)
directs the general progress of aeneas's destiny, ensuring that
aeneas is never permanently thrown off his course toward italy. [CHARACTER]'s
demeanor is controlled and levelheaded compared to the volatility
of juno and venus.
