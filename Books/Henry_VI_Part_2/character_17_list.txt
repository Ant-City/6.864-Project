Jack Cade  - 
      A common man and fierce warrior, Cade is hired by York to raise a ruckus in England while York is away. He tells Cade to pretend he is a Yorkist claimant to the throne, to see how the public responds. York plans to return and take over if Cade is successful. In fact, Cade is very successful; he takes London, kills Stafford and his brother, and puts to death a number of literate people, including Lord Saye, who he accuses of ruining the commonwealth with grammar. Cade metes out great violence throughout the country. When his troops betray him under the influence of rhetoric of the king's nobles, Cade flees. Starving in the countryside, he steals from Alexander Iden's garden, and they come to blows. Cade dies.
