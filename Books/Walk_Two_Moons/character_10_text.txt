i could tell you an extensively strange
story,' i warned.

   'oh, good!' gram said. 'delicious!' and that is how i happened to suspend
my tree prayers and tell them about phoebe winterbottom, her disappearing
mother, and the lunatic. it is also how i discovered that beneath phoebe's
story was another story.


3. bravery


   because i first saw phoebe on the day my father and i moved to euclid, i
began my story of phoebe with the visit to the red-headed margaret
cadaver's where i also met mrs.. partridge, her elderly mother. margaret
nearly fell over herself being nice to me. 'what lovely hair,' she said, and

'aren't you sweet!' i was not sweet that day. i was being particularly ornery.
i wouldn't sit down and i wouldn't look at margaret.

   as we were leaving, i overheard margaret whisper to my father, 'john,
have you told her yet - how we met?'

   my father looked exceedingly uncomfortable. 'no, he said. 'i tried - but she
doesn't want to know.'

   now that was the truth, absolutely. who
 
 ___________________________
 
 cares? i thought. who cares how
he met margaret cadaver?

   i was standing on the porch, and i saw phoebe's face again at the window
next door. at the time, all i could think of was getting to our new house,
which i hoped would be miles and miles away, out in the green countryside.
when at last we left mrs. cadaver and mrs. partridge, we drove for
approximately three minutes. two blocks from margaret cadaver's was the
place where my father and i were now going to live.

   if someone had blindfolded me and spun me around a few times and
driven me around for an hour and then removed my blindfold, i would have
thought that i was still in front of margaret's house. tiny, squirt trees. little
birdhouses in a row - and one of those birdhouses was ours. no swimming
hole, no barn, no cows, no chickens, no pigs. instead, a little w

mother's mouth would turn down and she'd say, 'really? is that so?' and she
sounded exactly like a pickford.


4. that's what i'm telling you


   on the day that phoebe sat next to me at lunch and told me i was 'ever so
brave', she invited me to her house for dinner-that night.

   'sure,' i said. to be honest, i was relieved that i would not have to eat at
margaret's again. i did not want to see dad and margaret smiling at each
other. i knew that margaret and her elderly mother, mrs. partridge, were
trying their best to make me feel welcome, but they were a bit odd, and i
was feeling sad and ornery all the time.

   i wanted everything to be like it was. i wanted to be back in bybanks
kentucky, in the hills and the trees, near the cows and chickens and pigs i
wanted to run down the hill from the barn and through the kitchen door that
banged behind me, and see my mother and my father sitting at the table
peeling apples.

   phoebe and i walked home from school together. we stopped bri

 him find a
job selling farm machinery. when i phoned him that day, he said it made
him happy as a clam at high water to know i had a new friend. maybe this is
really why he was happy, i thought, or maybe it was because he could be
alone with margaret cadaver.

   phoebe and i then walked to her house. as we passed margaret cadaver's
house, a voice called out 'sal? sal? is that you'!'

   phoebe put her hand up to her mouth and said. 'oh!'

   in the shadows on the porch. margaret's mother. mrs. partridge, sat in a
wicker rocker. a thick, gnarled cane with a handle carved in the shape of a
cobra's head lay across her knees her purple dress had slipped up over her
bony knees, which were spread apart, and, i hate to say it, you could see
right up her skirt. around her neck was a yellow feather scarf ('my boa' she
once told me, 'my most favouritest boa').

   as i started up the walk, phoebe pulled on my arm. 'don't go up there,' she
said.

   'it's only mrs. partridge,' i said. 'come on.'


   'w

ho's that with you?' mrs. partridge said. 'what's that on her face?' i
knew what she was going to do. she did this with me the first time i met her.

   phoebe placed her hands on her own round face and felt about. 'is it beans?
is it the beans from that red bean salad i had at lunch?'

   'come here,' mrs. partridge said. she wriggled her crooked little fingers at
phoebe.

   phoebe looked at me, and i pushed her a little closer. mrs. partridge put
her fingers up to phoebe's face and mashed around gently over her eyelids
and down her cheeks. then she said, 'just as i thought. it's two eyes, a nose
and a mouth.' then she laughed a wicked laugh that sounded as if it was
bouncing off jagged rocks. 'you're thirteen years old.'

   'yes' phoebe said.

   'i knew it,' mrs. partridge said. 'i just knew it.' she patted her yellow
feather boa.

   'this is phoebe winterbottom,' i said. 'she lives right next door to you.

   when we left, phoeb

e whispered, 'i wish you hadn't done that. i wish you
hadn't told her i lived next door.

   'why not? you don't seem to know mrs. cadaver and mrs. partridge very
well--'

   'they haven't lived there very long. only a month or so.'

   'don't you think it's remarkable that she guessed your age like that?'

   'i don't see what is so remarkable about it,' phoebe said. before i could
explain, she started telling me about the time that she and her mother, father
and sister prudence, had gone to the state fair. they went to a booth where
a crowd was gathered around a tall, thin man.

   'so, what was he doing?' i asked.


   'that's what i'm telling y

.

   'that's what i'm telling you,' phoebe said. 'the thin man would look
someone over carefully, close his eyes, and then he would point his finger at
the person and shout, "seventy-two!" '

   'at everyone? he guessed everyone to be seventy- two?'

   'sal,' she said. 'that's what i am trying to tell you. i was just giving an
example. he might have said, "ten" or "thirty" or "seventy-two". it just
depended on the person. he was astounding.

   i really thought it was more astounding that mrs. partridge could do this,
but i didn't say anything.

   phoebe said that her father wanted the thin man to guess his age. 'my
father thinks he looks very young for his age, and he was certain he could
fool the man. after studying my father closely, the thin man closed his eyes,
pointed his finger at my father and shouted. ''fifty-two!" my father gave a
little cry of astonishment. and all around people were automatically
beginning to say "oh!" and "amazing" and all that. but my father stopped
them.

   'w

   'no,' i said. 'i like blackberries very much. i just have some allergies, i
think.'

   'to blackberries''' mrs. winterbottom said,

   'oh, no. not to blackberries.' the truth is, i do not have allergies, but i
could not admit that the sight of blackberries reminded me of my mother.

   mrs. winterbottom made me and phoebe sit down at the kitchen table and
tell her about our day. she brought out a plate of homemade cookies. phoebe
told her about mrs. partridge guessing her age.

   'she's really remarkable,' i said.

   phoebe said, 'it's not that remarkable, sal. i wouldn't exactly use the word
"remarkable".

   'but, phoebe,' i said, 'mrs. partridge is blind.'

   both phoebe and her mother said, 'blind?'

   later, phoebe said to me, 'don't you think it's odd' that mrs. partridge,
who is blind, could see something about me - but i, who can see, was blind
about her? and speaking of odd, there's something very odd about that mrs.
cadaver.

was not sure 'just in case' what - maybe in case someone had stuck in and
opened all the windows and unlocked all the doors in the fifteen minutes
between the time she left and the time we did. 'you can never be too careful,'
mrs. winterbottom had said.

   the doorbell rang. phoebe and i looked out the window. standing on the
porch was a young man who looked about seventeen or eighteen, although i
am not as good at guessing people's ages as blind mrs. partridge is the
young man was wearing a black t-shirt and blue jeans, and his hands were
stuffed into his pockets. he seemed nervous

   'my mother hates it when strangers come to the door,' phoebe said. 'she is
convinced that any day one of them will burst into the house and start
waving a gun around and turn out to be an escaped lunatic.'


   'oh, honestly, phoebe,' i said. 'do you want me to answer the door?'

   phoebe took a deep breath. 'we'll do it together. she opened the door and

oked out the window. he was still
there. 'are you doing your mythology report?' i asked. 'i guess i might as
well sit out here and do mine, too.'

   he didn't say anything. in fact, neither of us said anything. he was reading
his book and taking notes i tried to read mine, but it was difficult to think
with him sitting there. i was relieved when it was time to go to phoebe's.


   when we passed mrs. cadaver's house, someone called my name. i didn't
see anyone at first, but then i spotted mrs. partridge sitting in a lawn chair
beside the house.

   'hello,' i said.

   'who's that?' ben asked.

   'mrs. partridge. she's blind.'

   he gave me a queer look. 'then, how did she know who you were?' it was
a good question, but i did not know how to answer it. when i knocked at
phoebe's door, ben said,' i'll be going now.

   i took a quick look at him and turned back to the door, but in the instant
that i was turning my head, he leaned forward, and i do believe his lips
kissed my ear. i was not sur

 'but, phoebe, it's late. it's dark.

   'it's urgent, sal.'

   phoebe was waiting in front of mrs. cadaver's house. there were no lights
on there. phoebe said, 'come on,' and she started up the walk.

   i admit that i was reluctant. 'phoebe---

   'shh, i just want to take a quick look.' she crept up onto the porch and
stood by the door. she listened and then tapped twice.

   'phoebe--'

   'shh.'  she  turned  the  doorknob.  the door was unlocked. 'apparently,
neither mrs. cadaver nor mrs. partridge are worried about lunatics' phoebe
whispered. 'doesn't that tell you something?'

   i don't think phoebe intended to go inside, but she did, and i followed. we
stood in the dark hallway. in the room to the right, a shaft of light from the
street lamp came in through the window. we went into that room. we both
nearly leaped through the window when someone said, 'sal?' i started
backing toward the door.

   'it's a ghost,' phoebe said.

   'come here,' the voice said.

o the dim light, i could see someone huddled in a
chair in the far corner. when i saw the cane, i was relieved. 'mrs. partridge?'

   'come over here,' she said. 'who's that with you? is that phoebe?'

   phoebe said, 'yes.' her voice was high and quivery.

   'i was just sitting here, reading,' mrs. partridge said.

   'isn't it awfully dark in here?' i said. i tripped over a table as i made my
way toward her.

   mrs. partridge laughed her wicked laugh. 'it's always dark in here. i don't
need lights, but you can turn some on if you want to.'

   as i stumbled around looking for a lamp, phoebe stood, frozen, near the
doorway. 'there,' i said. 'that's much better.' mrs. partridge was sitting in a
big, overstuffed chair. she was wearing a purple bathrobe and pink slippers
with floppy bunny ears at the toes on her lap was a book, her fingers resting
on the page. 'is it braille?' i asked. 'may i see?' i waved at phoebe to

into the room. i was afraid she was going to run out and leave me.

   mrs. partridge handed me the book, and i slid my fingers over the raised
bumps. i closed my eyes it must be difficult to read in this manner, because
your fingers have to work like eyes, to 'see' the shape of the dots 'how did
you know it was us?' i asked.

   'i just knew,' she said. 'your shoes make a particular sound and you have a
particular smell.'

   'what's the name of this book? what's it about?'

   mrs. partridge said, 'murder at midnight. it's a mystery.'

   phoebe said, 'erp,' and looked around the room.

   each time i went into that house i noticed new things. it was a scary place.
the walls were lined with shelves crammed with old musty books. the room
looked like some sort of museum filled with strange objects. on the floor
were three rugs with dark, swirly patterns of wild beasts in forests two

chairs were covered in similar, ghastly designs. a sofa was draped in a bear
skin.

   on the wall b

ehind the couch were two thumpingly grim african masks
the mouths on the masks were wide open, as if in the midst of a scream.
everywhere you looked there was something startling: a stuffed squirrel, a
kite in the shape of a dragon, a wooden cow with a spear piercing its side.

   'goodness!' phoebe said. 'what a lot of - of - unusual things'

   'feel free to look around,' mrs. partridge said.

   phoebe knelt to examine a spot on the floor.

   'what's the matter?' mrs. partridge said.

   phoebe jumped up. 'nothing. nothing whatsoever.

   'did i drop something on the floor?' mrs. partridge asked.

   'no. nothing whatsoever on the floor,' phoebe said. leaning against the
back of the sofa was an enormous sword. phoebe examined the blade.

   'careful you don't cut yourself,' mrs. partridge said.

   phoebe stepped back. even i found this unsettling, that mrs. partridge
could see what phoebe was doing even though she couldn't actually see her.

   mrs. partridge said, '

   'grandiful?' phoebe said.

   'yes! most grandiful - and a little peculible, too, i suppose,' mrs. partridge
said.

   'peculible?' phoebe said.

   'phoebe and i have to be going...' we backed toward the door.


   'by the way,' mrs. partridge said, as we reached the doorway, 'what was it
you wanted?'

   phoebe looked at me and i looked at phoebe. 'we were just passing by,' i
said, 'and we thought we would see how you were doing.'

   'that's nice,' mrs. partridge said, patting her knees. 'oh, phoebe, i think i
met your brother.

   phoebe said, 'i don't have a brother.

   'oh?' mrs. partridge tapped her head. 'i guess this old noggin isn't as sharp
as it used to be.' as we left, she said, 'goodness! you girls stay up late.'

   outside, phoebe said, 'at least, i was able to do a preliminary investigation
without arousing any suspicion. i'll make a list of items, which the police
will want to investigate further: the sword, the suspicious spot on the fl

 it was sadder than seeing my own father cry,
because my father is the sort of person you expect might cry if he was
terribly upset. but i had never, ever, expected mr. winterbottom - stiff mr.
winterbottom - to cry. it was the first time i realized that he actually cared
about mrs. winterbottom.

   as soon as it was daylight, i phoned phoebe. 'phoebe, we've got to find
her.


   'that's what i've been telling you,' she said.


32. the photograph


   the next day was most 'peculible', as mrs. partridge would say.

   phoebe arrived at school with another message, which she had found on
her porch that morning: we never know the worth of water until the well is
dry. 'it's a clue,' phoebe said. 'maybe my mother is hidden in a well.'

   i walked straight into ben when i went to my locker. that grapefruit
aroma was in the air. he looked past me at phoebe, who was going into
class. 'is she going to wear that ratty old sweater every day?' he asked.

   'it's not ratty,' i said. 'it's her mother's s

me about peeby. tell me that story, but don't make it too awfully sad.' she
folded her hands on her chest. 'tell me what happened with the lunatic.'

   when i saw the picture of the lunatic on sergeant bickle's desk, i tore out
of that office faster than lightning. i ran past sergeant bickle standing in the
parking lot. there was no sign of phoebe. i ran all the way to her house. as i
was passing mrs. cadaver's house, mrs. partridge called to me from her
porch.

   i stopped. 'you look all dressed up,' i said. 'are you going somewhere?'

   'oh, yes' she said. 'i'm redible.

   'you mean "ready"?'


   'yes redible as can be.' she tottered down the steps swinging her cobra
cane in front of her.

   'are you walking?' i asked.

   she reached down and touched her legs. 'isn't that what you call it when
you move your legs like i am doing?'

   'no, i meant are you walking to wherever you're going?'

   'oh, no, it's much to

o far for these legs jimmy's coming. he'll be here any

she didn't fall. she stepped out so confidently, barely using her cane at all. a
car pulled up in front of the house.

   'there he is' she said. she called out to the driver, 'i'm redible. i said i
would be, and here i am.'

   the driver leaped out of the car. 'sal?' he said.'i had no idea you two were
neighbours' it was mr. birkway.

   'we're not neighbours: i said. 'it's phoebe, actually, who is the neighbor.

   'is that right?' he said. he

 opened the car door for mrs. partridge. 'come
on, mom,' he said. 'let's get a move on.'

   'mom?' i said. i looked at mrs. partridge. 'this is your son? you're his
mother?'

   'why, of course,' mrs. partridge said.' this is my little jimmy.'

   'but, he's a birkway….?'

   mrs. partridge said, 'i was a birkway once. then i was a partridge. i'm still
a partridge.'

   'then, who is mrs. cadaver?' i said.

   'my little margie,' she said. 'she was a birkway, too. now she's a cadaver.


   i said to mr. birkway, 'mrs. cadaver is your sister?'

   'we're twins' mr. birkway said.

   'they're just alike,' mrs. partridge said.

   when they had driven away, i knocked at phoebe's door. i knocked and
knocked. there was no answer. at home, i dialed phoebe's number over and
over. no answer.

   the next day at school, i was relieved to see phoebe. 'where were

epeated, 'and i want to apologize for reading it
aloud.'


   apologize? that was a relief it was so quiet in the room that i could hear
the leaves being blown off the trees outside.

   mr. birkway coughed. 'i want to explain something,' he said. 'mrs.
cadaver is my sister.

   'your sister?' phoebe said.

   'and her husband is dead.'

   'i thought so,' phoebe said.

   'but, she didn't murder him,' mr. birkway said. 'her husband died when a
drunk driver rammed into his car. my mother - mrs. partridge - was also in
the car with mr. cadaver. she didn't die, as you know, but she lost her sight.

   'oh--' i said. phoebe stared at the floor.

   'my sister margaret was the nurse on duty in the emergency room when
they brought in her husband and our mother. margaret's husband died that
night.'

   the whole time mr. birkway was talking, phoebe's father was sitting
beside her with his hand resting on her shoulder. it looked like the only thing
that was keeping phoebe from vaporizing into the air

od up. 'i knew it wouldn't work,' he said.

   mr. winterbottom said, 'i have nothing against you, mike - i just don't
know you.' he looked at his wife. 'i don't think i know you, either.

   i was wishing i was invisible. i stared out the window at the leaves falling
to the ground, and i was infinitely sad, sad down to my bones. i was sad for
phoebe and her parents and prudence and mike, i was sad for the leaves that
were dying, and i was sad for myself, for something i had lost.

   i saw mrs. partridge out front, standing on phoebe's front walk.

   mr. winterbottom said, 'i think we all need to sit down and talk. maybe
we can sort something out. then he did what i think was a noble thing. he
went over to mike and shook his hand and said, 'i did always think a son
would be a nice addition to this family.

   mrs. winterbottom looked extensively relieved. prudence smiled at mike.
phoebe stood quite still off to the side.

   'i'd better go,' i said.

   everyone turned to me as if i had just d

   mrs. winterbottom went over to phoebe. 'you're mad at me, aren't you,
phoebe?'


   'yes,' phoebe said. 'i most certainly am.' phoebe took my sleeve and pulled
me toward the door. she turned back around to say, 'when you all decide
exactly how many people are in this family, let me know.'

   phoebe pulled me out on the porch, just as mrs. partridge placed a white
envelope on the steps.


41. the gifts


   it seemed fitting that at this point in my story of phoebe, gramps called
out, 'i-dee-ho!' we were high in the mountains and had just crossed the
montana border into idaho. for the first time, i believed we were going to
make it to lewiston by the next day, the twentieth of august, my mother's
birthday.

   gramps suggested we press on to coeur d'alene, about an hour away,
where we could spend the night. from there, lewiston was about a

ant to stop now, that would be ok,' i said.

   'oh, no,' she said. 'i'd like to sleep in coeur d'alene tonight. your momma
sent us a postcard from coeur d'alene, and on it was a beautiful blue lake.'
she coughed a long, rattly cough.

   gramps said, 'ok then, beautiful blue lake, here we come.'


   gram said, 'i'm so glad peeby's momma came home. i wish your momma
could come home too.'

   gramps nodded his head for about five minutes. then he handed me a
tissue and said, 'tell us about mrs. partridge. what was she doing leaving a
gol-dang envelope on peeby's porch?'

   that's what phoebe and i wanted to know. when we stepped out the door,
mrs. partridge tilted her head up at us.

   'did you want something, mrs. partridge?' i asked.

   she put her hand to her lips 'hmm,' she said.

   phoebe snatched the envelope and ripped it open. she read the message
aloud: 'don't judge a man until you've walked two moons in his moccasins.'

   mrs. partridge turned to go. 'bye-bye,' she said.

   'mrs

. partridge,' phoebe called. 'we've already had this one.

   'i beg your pardon?' mrs. partridge said.

   'it was you, wasn't it?' phoebe said. 'you've been creeping around leaving
these things, haven't you?'

   'did you like them?' mrs. partridge said. as she stood there in the middle
of the sidewalk, with her head tilted up at us, and that quizzical look on her
face, she looked like a mischievous child. 'margaret reads them to me from
the paper each day, and when there is a nice one, i ask her to copy it down.
i'm sorry i gave you that one about the moccasins already. my noggin
forgot.'

   'but, why did you bring them here?' phoebe said.

   'i thought they would be grandiful surprises for you - like fortune cookies
only i didn't have
 
 ___________________________
 
 any cookies to put them in. did you like them, anyway?'

   phoebe looked at me for a long minute. then she went down the steps and
said, 'mrs. partridge, when was it you met my brother?'


   'you said you didn't have a brother,' mrs. partridge said.

   'i know, but you said you met him. when was that?'

   she tapped her head. 'noggin, remember. let's see. some time ago. a
week? 'two weeks? he came to my house by mistake, i suppose. he let me
feel his face. that's why i thought he was your brother. he has a similar
face. isn't that peculible?'

   phoebe looked back toward her house. she said,' no more peculible than
most things lately.'

   mrs. partridge tottered on down the walk and back to her house.

middle of october that said,


roses are red
dirt is brown,

please be my valentine,

or else i'll frown.


   there was a p. s. added: i've never written poetry before.

   i sent a valentine back that said:



dry is the desert,
wet is the rain,
your love for me

is not in vain.


   i added a p.s. that said, i've never written any poetry either.

   ben and phoebe and mrs. cadaver and mrs. partridge are all coming to
visit next month. there is a chance that mr. birkway might come as well,
but phoebe hopes not, as she does not think she could stand to be in a car for
that long with a teacher. my father and i have been scrubbing the house for
their visit. i can't wait to show phoebe and ben the swimming hole and the
fields, the hayloft and the trees, and the cows and the chickens blackberry,
the chicken that ben gave me, is queen of the coop, and i'll show ben her,
too. i am hoping, also, fo
