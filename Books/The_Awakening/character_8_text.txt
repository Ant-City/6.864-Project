solicitation of every one present followed it with the overture to “the
poet and the peasant.”

“allez vous-en! sapristi!” shrieked the parrot outside the door. he was
the only being present who possessed sufficient candor to admit that he
was not listening to these gracious performances for the first time that
summer. old monsieur farival, grandfather of the twins, grew indignant
over the interruption, and insisted upon having the bird removed and
consigned to regions of darkness. victor lebrun objected; and his
decrees were as immutable as those of fate. the parrot fortunately
offered no further interruption to the entertainment, the whole venom
of his nature apparently having been cherished up and hurled against the
twins in that one impetuous outburst.

later a young brother and sister gave recitations, which every one
present had heard many times at winter evening entertainments in the
city.

a little girl performed a skirt dance in the center of the floor.
the mother played her a

the thirties; her husband, a jovial fellow, something of a shallow-pate,
who laughed a good deal at other people’s witticisms, and had thereby
made himself extremely popular. mrs. highcamp had accompanied them. of
course, there was alcee arobin; and mademoiselle reisz had consented
to come. edna had sent her a fresh bunch of violets with black lace
trimmings for her hair. monsieur ratignolle brought himself and his
wife’s excuses. victor lebrun, who happened to be in the city, bent upon
relaxation, had accepted with alacrity. there was a miss mayblunt, no
longer in her teens, who looked at the world through lorgnettes and with
the keenest interest. it was thought and said that she was intellectual;
it was suspected of her that she wrote under a nom de guerre. she had
come with a gentleman by the name of gouvernail, connected with one of
the daily papers, of whom nothing special could be said, except that he
was observant and seemed qu

iet and inoffensive. edna herself made the
tenth, and at half-past eight they seated themselves at table, arobin
and monsieur ratignolle on either side of their hostess.

mrs. highcamp sat between arobin and victor lebrun. then came mrs.
merriman, mr. gouvernail, miss mayblunt, mr. merriman, and mademoiselle
reisz next to monsieur ratignolle.

there was something extremely gorgeous about the appearance of the
table, an effect of splendor conveyed by a cover of pale yellow satin
under strips of lace-work. there were wax candles, in massive brass
candelabra, burning softly under yellow silk shades; full, fragrant
roses, yellow and red, abounded. there were silver and gold, as she had
said there would be, and cryst

ask if he remembered the name of the author whose book she had bought
the week before to send to a friend in geneva. she was talking “books”
 with mr. gouvernail and trying to draw from him his opinion upon current
literary topics. her husband told the story of the waco man privately
to miss mayblunt, who pretended to be greatly amused and to think it
extremely clever.

mrs. highcamp hung with languid but unaffected interest upon the warm
and impetuous volubility of her left-hand neighbor, victor lebrun.
her attention was never for a moment withdrawn from him after seating
herself at table; and when he turned to mrs. merriman, who was prettier
and more vivacious than mrs. highcamp, she waited with easy indifference
for an opportunity to reclaim his attention. there was the occasional
sound of music, of mandolins, sufficiently removed to be an agreeable
accompaniment rather than an interruption to the conversation. outside
the soft, monotonous splash of a fountain could be heard; the sound
