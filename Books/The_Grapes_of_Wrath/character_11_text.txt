they topped the next rise and the road dropped into an old water-cut, ugly and raw, 
a ragged course, and freshet scars cutting into it from both sides. a few stones were in 
the crossing. joad minced across in his bare feet. "you talk about pa," he said. "maybe 
you never seen uncle john the time they baptized him over to polk's place. why, he 
got  to  plungin'  an'  jumpin'.  jumped  over  a  feeny  bush  as  big  as  a  piana.  over  he'd

pa, he figgers he's the bes' jesus-jumper in these parts. so pa picks out a feeny bush

hammering rays were weaker. the strung wire on crooked poles still edged the road. 
on the right-hand side a line of wire fence strung out across the cotton field, and the 
dusty green cotton was the same on both sides, dusty and dry and dark green. 

joad pointed to the boundary fence. "that there's our line. we didn't really need no 
fence there, but we had the wire, an' pa kinda liked her there. said it give him a feelin' 
that forty was forty. wouldn't of had the fence if uncle john didn't come drivin' in one 
night with six spools of wire in his wagon. he give 'em to pa for a shoat. we never did 
know where he got that wire." they slowed for the rise, moving their feet in the deep 
soft dust, feeling the earth with their feet. joad's eyes were inward on his memory. he 
seemed to be laughing inside himself. "uncle john was a crazy bastard," he said. "like 
what he done with that shoat." he chuckled and walked on.

casy suggested elaborately, "maybe tom'll kill the fatted calf like for the prodigal

joad  laughed  scornfully.  "you  don't  know  pa.  if  he  kills  a  chicken  most  of  the 
squawkin' will come from pa, not the chicken. he don't never learn. he's always savin' 
a pig for christmus and then it dies in september of bloat or somepin so you can't eat

they moved over the curving top of the hill and saw the joad place below them.

and  the  sky  was  brilliant  over  the  spot  where  it  had  gone,  and  a  torn  cloud,  like  a 
bloody  rag,  hung  over  the  spot  of  its  going.  and  dusk  crept  over  the  sky  from  the 
eastern  horizon,  and  darkness  crept  over  the  land  from  the  east.  the  evening  star 
flashed and glittered in the dusk. the gray cat sneaked away toward the open barn shed 
and passed inside like a shadow. 

joad said, "well, we ain't gonna walk no eight miles to uncle john's place tonight. 
my dogs is burned up. how's it if we go to your place, muley? that's on'y about a 
mile." 

"won't  do  no  good."  muley  seemed  embarrassed.  "my  wife  an'  the  kids  an'  her 
brother all took an' went to california. they wasn't nothin' to eat. they wasn't as mad 
as me, so they went. they wasn't nothin' to eat here."

the gulch leveled off, and the footing was sand. 

joad settled himself on the clean sand. "i ain't gonna sleep in no cave," he said. "i'm 

gonna sleep right here." he rolled his coat and put it under his head. 

muley pulled at the covering brush and crawled into his cave. "i like it in here," he 

called. "i feel like nobody can come at me." 

jim casy sat down on the sand beside joad. 
"get some sleep," said joad. "we'll start for uncle john's at daybreak." 
"i ain't sleepin," said casy. "i got too much to puzzle with." he drew up his feet and 
clasped his legs. he threw back his head and looked at the sharp stars. joad yawned 
and  brought  one  hand  back  under  his  head.  they  were  silent,  and  gradually  the 
skittering  life  of  the  ground,  of  holes  and  burrows,  of  the  brush,  began  again;  the 
gophers moved, and the rabbits crept to green things, the mice scampered over clods,

"no," said joad. "i think he's scared to see people now. wonder he come up to us. 
we'll be at uncle john's place by sunrise." they walked along in silence for a time, 
and the late owls flew over toward the barns, the hollow trees, the tank houses, where 
they  hid  from  daylight.  the  eastern  sky  grew  fairer  and  it  was  possible  to  see  the 
cotton plants and the graying earth. "damn' if i know how they're all sleepin' at uncle 
john's. he on'y got one room an' a cookin' leanto, an' a little bit of a barn. must be a

the  preacher  laughed  softly.  "you  know,"  he  said,  "it's  a  nice  thing  not  bein'  a

laugh. an' i couldn' cuss. now i cuss all i want, any time i want, an' it does a fella

a  redness  grew  up  out  of  the  eastern  horizon,  and  on  the  ground  birds  began  to 
chirp, sharply. "look!" said joad. "right ahead. that's uncle john's tank. can't see the

all the folks are there." the hulk of the tank stood above a rise. joad, hurrying, raised a 
cloud of dust about his knees. "i wonder if ma—" they saw the tank legs now, and the 
house, a square little box, unpainted and bare, and the barn, low-roofed and huddled.

furniture, the blades and mot

and casy leaned back against the house wall. and the shadow of the afternoon moved 
out from the house. 

in the late afternoon the truck came back, bumping and rattling through the dust, 
and there was a layer of dust in the bed, and the hood was covered with dust, and the 
headlights were obscured with a red flour. the sun was setting when the truck came 
back, and the earth was bloody in its setting light. al sat bent over the wheel, proud 
and serious and efficient, and pa and uncle john, as befitted the heads of the clan, had 
the honor seats beside the driver. standing in the truck bed, holding onto the bars of the 
sides, rode the others, twelve-year-old ruthie and ten-year-old winfield, grime-faced 
and wild, their eyes tired but excited, their fingers and the edges of their mouths black 
and sticky from licorice whips, whined out of their father in town. ruthie, dressed in a 
real dress of pink muslin that came below her knees, was a little serious in her young-
ladiness.

too much; fought when it was required of him; and never boasted. he sat quietly in a 
gathering and yet managed to be there and to be recognized. 

had he not been fifty years old, and so one of the natural rulers of the family, uncle 
john would have preferred not to sit in the honor place beside the driver. he would 
have liked rose of sharon to sit there. this was impossible, because she was young 
and a woman. but uncle john sat uneasily, his lonely haunted eyes were not at ease, 
and his thin strong body was not relaxed. nearly all the time the barrier of loneliness 
cut uncle john off from people and from appetites. he ate little, drank nothing, and 
was  celibate.  but  underneath,  his  appetites  swelled  into  pressures  until  they  broke 
through. then he would eat of some craved food until he was sick; or he would drink 
jake or whisky until he was a shaken paralytic with red wet eyes; or he would raven

and while no one would say it, everyone, and al most of all, would 
know it was his fault. and so he felt it, watched it, and listened to it. and his face was 
serious and responsible. and everyone respected him and his responsibility. even pa, 
who was the leader, would hold a wrench and take orders from al. 

they were all tired on the truck. ruthie and winfield were tired from seeing too 
much movement, too many faces, from fighting to get licorice whips; tired from the 
excitement of having uncle john secretly slip gum into their pockets. 

and the men in the seat were tired and angry and sad, for they had got eighteen 
dollars for every movable thing from the farm: the horses, the wagon, the implements, 
and  all  the  furniture  from  the  house.  eighteen  dollars.  they  had  assailed  the  buyer, 
argued; but they were routed when his interest seemed to flag and he had told them he 
didn't want the stuff at any price. then they were beaten, believed him, and took two 
dollars less than

we got trouble enough without they chase the hell out of us. i hope it ain't true. we got 
to talk that out in the open." 

uncle john said, "tom, he'll know." 
they fell silent while the truck battered along. the engine was noisy, full of little 
clashings, and the brake rods banged. there was a wooden creaking from the wheels, 
and a thin jet of steam escaped through a hole in the top of the radiator cap. the truck 
pulled a high whirling column of red dust behind it. they rumbled up the last little rise 
while the sun was still half-face above the horizon, and they bore down on the house as

noah took his knife, and al the ax, and the four men moved down on the sty, their 
legs flickering in the lantern light. ruthie and winfield skittered along, hopping over 
the ground. at the sty pa leaned over the fence holding the lantern. the sleepy young 
pigs struggled to their feet, grunting suspiciously. uncle john and the preacher walked 
down to help. 

"all  right,"  said  pa.  "stick  'em,  an'  we'll  run  'em  up  and  bleed  an'  scald  at  the 
house."  noah  and  tom  stepped  over  the  fence.  they  slaughtered  quickly  and 
efficiently. tom struck twice with the blunt head of the ax; and noah, leaning over the

barn to sleep, and grampa carried a candle lantern in his hand. the rest of the family

backs against the house wall, uncle john on a box. pa in the doorway. only ma and 
rose of sharon continued to move about. ruthie and winfield were sleepy now, but 
fighting  it  off.  they  quarreled  sleepily  out  in  the  darkness,  noah  and  the  preacher 
squatted side by side, facing the house. pa scratched himself nervously, and took off 
his hat and ran his fingers through his hair. "tomorra we'll get that pork salted early in

and tom shook himself free of the numbness. "jesus christ, it's near sunrise," he 
said  loudly.  "we  got  to  get  goin'."  and  the  others  came  out  of  their  numbness  and 
moved toward the truck. 

"come on," tom said. "le's get grampa on." pa and uncle john and tom and al 
went into the kitchen where grampa slept, his forehead down on his arms, and a line of 
drying coffee on the table. they took him under the elbows and lifted him to his feet, 
and he grumbled and cursed thickly, like a drunken man. out the door they boosted 
him,  and  when  they  came  to  the  truck  tom  and  al  climbed  up,  and  leaning  over, 
hooked their hands under his arms and lifted him gently up, and laid him on top of the 
load. al untied the tarpaulin, and they ro

door  open  and  half  pulled  the  struggling  old  lady  out  beside  the  road  and  into  the 
bushes. and ma held her so granma would not fall when she squatted. 

on top of the truck the others stirred to life. their faces were shining with sunburn 
they could not escape. tom and casy and noah and uncle john let themselves wearily 
down.  ruthie  and  winfield  swarmed  down  the  side-boards  and  went  off  into  the 
bushes. connie helped rose of sharon gently down. under the canvas, grampa was 
awake, his head sticking out, but his eyes were drugged and watery and still senseless. 
he watched the others, but there was little recognition in his watching. 

tom called to him, "want to come down, grampa?" 
the  old  eyes  turned  listlessly  to  him.  "no,"  said  grampa.  for  a  moment  the

"but i felt it hurt. i felt it kinda jar when i yelled." 
"come set down. it wasn't nothin'. it won't hurt." he led her to the side of the truck 

away from the dying dog and sat her down on the running board. 

tom and uncle john walked out to the mess. the last quiver was going out of the 
crushed body. tom took it by the legs and dragged it to the side of the road. uncle 
john looked embarrassed, as though it were his fault. "i ought ta tied him up," he said. 
pa looked down at the dog for a moment and then he turned away. "le's get outa

"you goddamn right," said grampa weakly. "sicker'n hell." 

without warning grampa began to cry. his chin wavered and his old lips tightened 
over  his  mouth  and  he  sobbed  hoarsely.  ma  rushed  over  to  him  and  put  her  arms 
around him. she lifted him to his feet, her broad back straining, and she half lifted, half 
helped him into the tent. 

uncle john said, "he must be good an' sick. he ain't never done that before. never 
seen  him  blubberin'  in  my  life."  he  jumped  up  on  the  truck  and  tossed  a  mattress 
down. 

ma came out of the tent and went to casy. "you been aroun' sick people," she said. 

"grampa's sick. won't you go take a look at him?" 

casy  walked  quickly  to  the  tent  and  went  inside.  a  double  mattress  was  on  the 
ground, the blankets spread neatly; and a little tin stove stood on iron legs, and the fire

sputtered  blue  smoke  from  the  diesel  oil.  one  man  drove  each  truck,  and  his  relief 
man  slept  in  a  bunk  high  up  against  the  ceiling.  but  the  trucks  never  stopped;  they 
thundered day and night and the ground shook under their heavy march. 

the family became a unit. pa squatted down on the ground, and uncle john beside 
him. pa was the head of the family now. ma stood behind him. noah and tom and al 
squatted, and the preacher sat down, and then reclined on his elbow. connie and rose 
of sharon walked at a distance. now ruthie and winfield, clattering up with a bucket 
of  water  held  between  them,  felt  the  change,  and  they  slowed  up  and  set  down  the 
bucket and moved quietly to stand with ma.

uncle john broke in, "we never did have no paupers." 
tom  said,  "maybe  we  got  to  learn.  we  never  got  booted  off  no  land  before, 

"we done it clean," said pa. "there can't no blame be laid on us. we never took 
nothin'  we  couldn'  pay;  we  never  suffered  no  man's  charity.  when  tom  here  got  in 
trouble we could hold up our heads. he only done what any man would a done." 

"then what'll we do?" uncle john asked. 
"we go in like the law says an' they'll come out for him. we on'y got

ground in front of their knees.

shaped the grave nice with his own shovel. that was a time when a man had the right 
to be buried by his own son an' a son had the right to bury his own father." 

"the law says different now," said uncle john. 
"sometimes the law can't be foller'd no way," said pa. "not in decency, anyways. 
they's lots a times you can't. when floyd was loose an' goin' wild, law said we got to

hands and pinned the comforter tight again. and then she went back to the fire. 

the men came from the grave, their faces shining with perspiration. "awright," said 
pa. he and john and noah and al went into the tent, and they came out carrying the 
long, pinned bundle between them. they carried it to the grave. pa leaped into the hole 
and received the bundle in his arms and laid it gently down. uncle john put out a hand 
and helped pa out of the hole. pa asked, "how about granma?" 

"i'll see," ma said. she walked to the mattress and looked down at the old woman 
for a moment. then she went back to the grave. "sleepin'," she said. "maybe she'd hold 
it against me, but i ain't a-gonna wake her up. she's tar'd." 

pa said, "where at's the preacher? we oughta have a prayer." 
tom said, "i seen him walkin' down the road. he don't like to pray no more." 
"don't like to pray?" 
"no," said tom. "he ain

head. 

pa said, "amen," and the others muttered, "a–men." then pa took the shovel, half 
filled  it  with  dirt,  and  spread  it  gently  into  the  black  hole.  he  handed  the  shovel  to 
uncle john, and john dropped in a shovelful. then the shovel went from hand to hand 
until every man had his turn. when all had taken their duty and their right, pa attacked 
the mound of loose dirt and hurriedly filled the hole. the women moved back to the 
fire to see to supper. ruthie and winfield watched, absorbed. 

ruthie  said  solemnly,  "grampa's  down  under  there."  and  winfield  looked  at  her 
with horrified eyes. and then he ran away to the fire and sat on the ground and sobbed

casy said, "he was foolin', all the time. i think he knowed it. an' grampa didn' die 

tonight. he died the minute you took 'im off the place." 

"you sure a that?" pa cried. 
"why,  no.  oh,  he  was  breathin',"  casy  went  on,  "but  he  was  dead.  he  was  that

uncle john said, "did you know he was a-dyin'?" 
"yeah," said casy. "i knowed it." 
john gazed at him, and a horror grew in his face. "an' you didn' tell nobody?" 
"what good?" casy asked. 
"we—we might of did somepin." 
"what?" 
"i don' know, but—" 
"no," casy said, "you couldn' a done nothin'. your way was fixed an' grampa didn' 
have  no  part  in  it.  he  didn'  suffer  none.  not  after  fust  thing  this  mornin'.  he's  jus'

the gathered family considered it. uncle john dropped to his hams beside pa. 
al said, "won't ya need me to give ya a han' with that con-rod?" 
"you said your own se'f you never fixed one." 
"that's right," al agreed. "all ya got to have is a strong back. maybe the preacher

"well—whoever—i don' care," said tom. 
pa scratched the dry earth with his forefinger. "i kind a got a notion tom's right," he

got on through, how'd we know where to leave the word, an' how'd you know where to

uncle john said, "but we could be makin' some money. we could have a little bit

"well, he ain't got no car. car's out in the road." 

"he came in a car," said the proprietor. "ever'body'd leave their car out there an'

tom said, "we'll drive along the road. meet ya in the morning. we'll watch for ya.

he made a quick decision, with a concession in it. "if the same number stays that

tom  brought  out  his  bag  of  tobacco,  a  limp  gray  rag  by  now,  with  a  little  damp 
tobacco dust in the bottom of it. he made a lean cigarette and tossed the bag away. 
"we'll go along pretty soon," he said.

they walked away through the sleeping camp. in front of one tent a low fitful fire 
burned and a woman watched a kettle that cooked early breakfast. the smell of the 
cooking beans was strong and fine. 

"like to have a plate a them," tom said politely as they went by. 
the woman smiled. "they ain't done or you'd be welcome," she said. "come aroun' 

pa cleared his throat. "fella was jus' sayin'—" 
tom grabbed his arm and yanked it. "funny what he says," tom said.

in her sleep. "i washed 'em up," ma said. "fust water we got enough of to give 'em a

"thank you, ma'am," tom said. he and casy and uncle john walked by the porch. 
the  proprietor  still  sat  in  his  chair,  and  the  lantern  hissed  and  flared.  he  turned  his 
head as the three went by. "ya runnin' outa gas," tom said. 

"well, time to close up anyways." 
"no more half-bucks rollin' down the road, i guess," tom said.

the man sat up and faced him. "look, mister. i don' know ever'thing. you might go 
out there an' fall into a steady job, an' i'd be a liar. an' then, you might never get no 
work, an' i didn' warn ya. i can tell ya mos' of the folks is purty mis'able." he lay back 
in the water. "a fella don' know ever'thing," he said. 

pa turned his head and looked at uncle john. "you never was a fella to say much," 
pa said. "but i'll be goddamned if you opened your mouth twicet sence we lef' home.

uncle john scowled. "i don't think nothin' about it. we're a-goin' there, ain't we?

"well, i'm goin' up in the brush an' get some sleep then." tom stood up and waded 
to the sandy shore. he slipped his clothes on his wet body and winced under the heat of 
the cloth. the others followed him.

potatoes from hand to hand until they cooled. 

ma  went  to  the  wilson  tent  and  stayed  for  ten  minutes,  and  then  she  came  out 

quietly. "it's time to go," she said. 

the men went under the tarpaulin. granma still slept, her mouth wide open. they 
lifted the whole mattress gently and passed it up on top of the truck. granma drew up 
her skinny legs and frowned in her sleep, but she did not awaken. 

uncle john and pa tied the tarpaulin over the cross-piece, making a little tight tent 
on top of the load. they lashed it down to the side-bars. and then they were ready. pa 
took out his purse and dug two crushed bills from it. he went to wilson and held them 
out. "we want you should take this, an'"—he pointed to the pork and potatoes—"an' 
that." 

wilson hung his head and shook it sharply. "i ain't a-gonna do it," he said. "you

tent; he stepped inside and the flaps fell behind him. 

for a few moments the family waited, and then, "we got to go," said tom. "it's near 

four, i bet." 

the family climbed on the truck, ma on top, beside granma. tom and al and pa in 
the seat, and winfield on pa's lap. connie and rose of sharon made a nest against the 
cab. the preacher and uncle john and ruthie were in a tangle on the load. 

pa called, "good-by, mister and mis' wilson." there was no answer from the tent. 
tom  started  the  engine  and  the  truck  lumbered  away.  and  as  they  crawled  up  the 
rough road toward needles and the highway, ma looked back. wilson stood in front of 
his tent, staring after them, and his hat was in his hand. the sun fell full on his face. 
ma waved her hand at him, but he did not respond.

tom  looked  over  at  him.  "might's  well  let  ever'body  out  'fore  we  settle  down  to 
drivin' tonight." he slowed the car and brought it to a stop. winfield scrambled out and 
urinated at the side of the road. tom leaned out. "anybody else?" 

"we're holdin' our water up here," uncle john called. 
pa said, "winfiel', you crawl up on top. you put my legs to sleep a-settin' on 'em." 
the little boy buttoned his overalls and obediently crawled up the back board and on 
his hands and knees crawled over granma's mattress and forward to ruthie. 

the  truck  moved  on  into  the  evening,  and  the  edge  of  the  sun  struck  the  rough 

horizon and turned the desert red.

heat changed. while the sun was up, it was a beating, flailing heat, but now the heat 
came from below, from the earth itself, and the heat was thick and muffling. the lights 
of the truck came on, and they illuminated a little blur of highway ahead, and a strip of 
desert on either side of the road. and sometimes eyes gleamed in the lights far ahead, 
but no animal showed in the lights. it was pitch dark under the canvas now. uncle john 
and the preacher were curled in the middle of the truck, resting on their elbows, and 
staring out the back triangle. they could see the two bumps that were ma and granma 
against the outside. they could see ma move occasionally, and her dark arm moving 
against the outside. 

uncle john talked to the preacher. "casy," he said, "you're a fella oughta know what 

to do." 

"what to do about what?" 
"i dunno," said uncle john. 
casy said, "well, that's gonna make it easy for me!"

much.'" uncle john put his hand on casy's knee and he peered through the darkness at 
him. "she gave me a look. an' she groaned all night, an' she died the next afternoon." 
the preacher mumbled something. "you see," john went on, "i kil't her. an' sence then 
i tried to make it up—mos'ly to kids. an' i tried to be good, an' i can't. i get drunk, an' i

then it's a sin. a fella builds his own sins right up from the groun'." 

"i got to give that goin'-over," said uncle john, and he rolled on his back and lay 

with his knees pulled up. 

the truck moved on over the hot earth, and the hours passed. ruthie and winfield 
went to sleep. connie loosened a blanket from the load and covered himself and rose 
of sharon with it, and in the heat they struggled together, and held their breaths. and 
after a time connie threw off the blanket and the hot tunneling wind felt cool on their 
wet bodies.

the sobbing breath was in her ear. and ma said over and over, "all right. it's gonna be

that." 

uncle john called, "you all right?" 
it  was  a  moment  before  she  answered.  "all  right.  guess  i  dropped  off  to  sleep." 

and after a time granma was still, and ma lay rigid beside her. 

the  night  hours  passed,  and  the  dark  was  in  against  the  truck.  sometimes  cars 
passed  them,  going  west  and  away;  and  sometimes  great  trucks  came  up  out  of  the 
west  and  rumbled  eastward.  and  the  stars  flowed  down  in  a  slow  cascade  over  the

there!" 
ruthie and winfield scrambled down from the car, and then they stood, silent and 
awestruck, embarrassed before the great valley. the distance was thinned with haze, 
and the land grew softer and softer in the distance. a windmill flashed in the sun, and 

its turning blades were like a little heliograph, far away. ruthie and winfield looked at 
it, and ruthie whispered, "it's california." 

winfield moved his lips silently over the syllables. "there's fruit," he said aloud. 
casy and uncle john, connie and rose of sharon climbed down. and they stood 
silently. rose of sharon had started to brush her hair back, when she caught sight of 
the valley and her hand dropped slowly to her side. 

tom said, "where's ma? i want ma to see it. look, ma! come here, ma." ma was 
climbing slowly, stiffly, down the back board. tom looked at her. "my god, ma, you 
sick?" her face was stiff and putty-like, and her eyes seemed to have sunk deep into 
her head, and the rims were red with weariness. her f

away from the body as they could get, stared at the tucked figure. 

and ruthie whispered, "tha's granma, an' she's dead." 
winfield nodded solemnly. "she ain't breathin' at all. she's awful dead." 
and rose of sharon said softly to connie, "she was a-dyin' right when we—" 
"how'd we know?" he reassured her. 
al climbed on the load to make room for ma in the seat. and al swaggered a little 
because he was sorry. he plumped down beside casy and uncle john. "well, she was 
ol'.  guess  her  time  was  up,"  al  said.  "ever'body  got  to  die."  casy  and  uncle  john 
turned eyes expressionlessly on him and looked at him as though he were a curious 
talking bush. "well, ain't they?" he demanded. and the eyes looked away, leaving al 
sullen and shaken. 

casy said in wonder, "all night long, an' she was alone." and he said, "john, there's 

a woman so great with love—she scares me. makes me afraid an' mean." 
john asked, "was it a sin? is they

the  family  on  top of the load, the children and connie and rose of sharon 
and  the  preacher  were  stiff  and  cramped.  they  had  sat  in  the  heat  in  front  of  the 
coroner's office in bakersfield while pa and ma and uncle john went in. then a basket 
was brought out and the long bundle lifted down from the truck. and they sat in the 
sun  while  the  examination  went  on,  while  the  cause  of  death  was  found  and  the 
certificate signed. 

al and tom strolled along the street and looked in store windows and watched the 

strange people on the sidewalks. 

and at last pa and ma and uncle john came out, and they were subdued and quiet. 
uncle john climbed up on the load. pa and ma got in the seat. tom and al str

"where's hooverville?" 
"this here's her." 
"oh!" said tom. "we jus' got in." 
winfield and ruthie came back, carrying a bucket of water between them. 
ma said, "le's get the camp up. i'm tuckered out. maybe we can all rest." pa and 

uncle john climbed up on the truck to unload the canvas and the beds. 

tom sauntered to the young man, and walked beside him back to the car he had 
been  working  on.  the  valve-grinding  brace  lay  on  the  exposed  block,  and  a  little 
yellow can of valve-grinding compound was wedged on top of the vacuum tank. tom 
asked, "what the hell was the matter'th that ol' fella with the beard?" 

the  young  man  picked  up  his  brace  and  went  to  work,  twisting  back  and  forth,

compound on a valve seat, and his hand jerked rapidly back and forth on the brace, and 
his face was dull and dumb. 

tom strolled slowly back to his camp. "bull-simple," he said under his breath. 
pa and uncle john came toward the camp, their arms loaded with dry willow sticks, 
and they threw them down by the fire and squatted on their hams. "got her picked over 
pretty good," said pa. "had ta go a long ways for wood." he looked up at the circle of 
staring children. "lord god almighty!" he said. "where'd you come from?" all of the 
children looked self-consciously at their feet. 

"guess they smelled the cookin'," said ma. "winfiel', get out from under foot." she 
pushed him out of her way. "got ta make

it was crowded now. the strange children stood close to the stew pot, so close that 
ma brushed them with her elbows as she worked. tom and uncle john stood beside 
her. 

ma said helplessly, "i dunno what to do. i got to feed the fambly. what'm i gonna 
do  with  these  here?"  the  children  stood  stiffly  and  looked  at  her.  their  faces  were 
blank, rigid, and their eyes went mechanically from the pot to the tin plate she held. 
their eyes followed the spoon from pot to plate, and when she passed the steaming 
plate up to uncle john, their eyes followed it up. uncle john dug his spoon into the 
stew, and the banked eyes rose up with

er and to talk softly. 

al crawled from under the joad tarpaulin and walked toward the willows to whistle 

for tom. ma came out and built her little fire of twigs. 

"pa," she said, "we ain't goin' to have much. we et so late." 
pa  and  uncle  john  stuck  close  to  the  camp,  watching  ma  peeling  potatoes  and 
slicing them raw into a frying pan of deep grease. pa said, "now what the hell made 
the preacher do that?" 

ruthie and winfield crept close and crouched down to hear the talk. 
uncle john scratched the earth deeply with a long rusty nail. "he knowed about sin. 
i ast him about sin, an' he tol' me; but i don' know if he's right. he says a fella's sinned 
if he thinks he's sinned." uncle john's eyes were tired and sad. "i been secret all my 
days," he said. "i done things i never tol' about." 

ma turned from the fire. "don' go tellin', john," she said. "tell 'em to god. don' go 

burdenin' other people with your sins. that ain't decent." 

"they're a-eatin' on me," said john. 
"w

pa nodded his head slowly at ma's words. "she's right," he said. "it gives a fella 

relief to tell, but it jus' spreads out his sin." 

uncle john looked up to the sun-gold mountains, and the mountains were reflected 
in his eyes. "i wisht i could run it down," he said. "but i can't. she's a-bitin' in my 
guts." 

behind him rose of sharon moved dizzily out of the tent. "where's connie?" she 

asked irritably. "i ain't seen connie for a long time. where'd he go?" 
"i ain't seen him," said ma. "if i see 'im, i'll tell 'im you want 'im." 
"i ain't feelin' good," said rose of sharon. "connie shouldn' of left me."

"you got to work," ma said. "set in the tent an' you'll get feelin' sorry about yaself. 
i ain't had time to take you in han'. i will now. you take this here knife an' get to them 
potatoes." 

the girl knelt down and obeyed. she said fiercely, "wait'll i see 'im. i'll tell 'im." 
ma smiled slowly. "he might smack you. you got it comin' with whinin' aroun' an' 
candyin' yaself. if he smacks some sense in you i'll bless 'im." the girl's eyes blazed 
with resentment, but she was silent. 

uncle john pushed his rusty nail deep into the ground with his broad thumb. "i got 

to tell," he said. 

pa said, "well, tell then, goddamn it! who'd ya kill?" 
uncle john dug with his thumbs into the watch pocket of his blue jeans and scooped 

out a folded dirty bill. he spread it out and showed it. "fi' dollars," he said. 

"steal her?" pa asked. 
"no, i had her. kept her out." 
"she was yourn, wasn't she?" 
"yeah, but i didn't have no right to keep her out." 
"i don't see much sin in that," ma said.

uncle john said slowly, "it ain't only the keepin' her out. i kep' her out to get drunk.

inside so i got to get drunk. figgered time wasn' yet, an' then—the preacher went an' 
give 'imself up to save tom." 

pa nodded his head up and down and cocked his head to hear. ruthie moved closer, 
like a puppy, crawling up on her elbows, and winfield followed her. rose of sharon 
dug at a deep eye in a potato with the point of

john said sadly. "an' i slipped up. i didn' jump on her, an'—an' she got away. lookie!" 
he said, "you got the money. gimme two dollars." 

pa reached reluctantly into his pocket and brought out the leather pouch. "you ain't 
gonna need no seven dollars to get drunk. you don't need to drink champagny water." 
uncle john held out his bill. "you take this here an' gimme two dollars. i can get 
good an' drunk for two dollars. i don' want no sin of waste on me. i'll spend whatever i

pa  took  the  dirty  bill  and  gave  uncle  john two  silver  dollars.  "there  ya  are,"  he 

said. "a fella got to do what he got to do. nobody don' know enough to tell 'im." 

uncle john took the coins. "you ain't gonna be mad? you know i got to?"

he  stood  up  and  walked  forlornly  away  in  the  evening.  he  walked  up  to  the 
concrete highway and across the pavement to the grocery store. in front of the screen 
door he took off his hat, dropped it into the dust, and ground it with his heel in self-
abasement. and he left his black hat there, broken and dirty. he entered the store and 
walked to the shelves where the whisky bottles stood behind wire netting. 

pa and ma and the children watched uncle john move away. rose of sharon kept 

her eyes resentfully on the potatoes.

ruthie turned on her side in the dust. she put her head close to winfield's head and 
pulled  his  ear  against  her  mouth.  she  whispered,  "i'm  gonna  get  drunk."  winfield 
snorted  and  pinched  his  mouth  tight.  the  two  children  crawled  away,  holding  their 
breath, their faces pu

rple with the pressure of their giggles. they crawled around the 
tent and leaped up and ran squealing away from the tent. they ran to the willows, and 
once concealed, they shrieked with laughter. ruthie crossed her eyes and loosened her 
joints; she staggered about, tripping loosely with her tongue hanging out. "i'm drunk," 
she said. 

"look," winfield cried. "looka me, here's me, an' i'm uncle john." he flapped his 

arms and puffed, he whirled until he was dizzy. 

"no,"  said  ruthie.  "here's  the  way.  here's  the  way.  i'm  uncle  john.  i'm  awful 

al  and  tom  walked  quietly  through  the  willows,  and  they  came  on  the  children 
staggering crazily about. the dusk was thick now. tom stopped and peered. "ain't that

crazy?" tom asked. 

the children stopped, embarrassed. "we was—jus' pla

things about connie if he's dead." 

tom broke in, "hey, what is this? we ain't sure connie's gone for good. we got no 

time for talkin'. we got to eat an' get on our way." 

"on  our  way?  we  jus'  come  here."  ma  peered  at  him  through  the  firelighted 

darkness. 

he explained carefully, "they gonna burn the camp tonight, ma. now you know i 
ain't got it in me to stan' by an' see our stuff burn up, nor pa ain't got it in him, nor 
uncle john. we'd come up a-fightin', an' i jus' can't afford to be took in an' mugged. i 
nearly got it today, if the preacher hadn' jumped in." 

ma  had  been  turning  the  frying  potatoes  in  the  hot  grease.  now  she  took  her 
decision. "come on!" she cried. "le's eat this stuff. we got to go quick." she set out 
the tin plates. 

pa said, "how 'bout john?" 
"where is uncle john?" tom asked. 
pa and ma were silent for a moment, and then pa said, "he went to get drunk." 
"jesus!" tom said. "what

"i don' know," said pa. 
tom stood up. "look," he said, "you all eat an' get the stuff loaded. i'll go look for 

uncle john. he'd of went to the store 'crost the road." 

tom walked quickly away. the little cooking fires burned in front of the tents and 
the  shacks,  and  the  light  fell  on  the  faces  of  ragged  men  and  women,  on  crouched 
children.  in  a  few  tents  the  light  of  kerosene  lamps  shone  through  the  canvas  and 
placed shadows of people hugely on the cloth.

"i got so many people to look out for an' tell stuff to, i can't ever remember 'em all." 
"don't put yourself out too much," tom said. he went out the screen door carrying 
uncle john's dusty black hat. he crossed the concrete road and walked along the edge 
of it. below him in the sunken field, the hooverville lay; and the little fires flickered 
and  the  lanterns  shone  through  the  tents.  somewhere  in  the  camp  a  guitar  sounded, 
slow chords, struck without any sequence, practice chords. tom stopped and listened, 
and then he moved slowly along the side of the road, and every few steps he stopped to 
listen  again.  he  had  gone  a  quarter  of  a  mile  before

voice was close this time, the same slow, tuneless singing,  

and the dull voice sang, 
 

"i've give my heart to jesus,  
so jesus take me home.  
i've give my soul to jesus,  
so jesus is my home."  

 

"oh, the night that maggie died,  
she called me to her side,  
an' give to me them ol'  
red flannel drawers that maggie wore.  
they was baggy at the knees—" 

 
tom moved cautiously forward. he saw the black form sitting on the ground, and 
he stole near and sat down. uncle john tilted the pint and the liquor gurgled out of the 
neck of the bottle. 

tom said quietly, "hey, wait! where do i come in?" 
uncle john turned his head. "who you?" 
"you forgot me awready? you had four drinks to my one." 
"no, tom. don't try fool me. i'm all alone here. you ain't been here." 
"well, i'm sure here now. how 'bout givin' me a snort?" 
uncle john raised the pint again and the whisky gurgled. he shook the bottle. it was 
empty. "no more," he said. "wanta die so bad. wanta die awful.

tom said, "listen here to me, uncle john. we're gonna move on. you come along, 

an' you can go right to sleep up on the load." 

john shook his head. "no. go on. ain't goin'. gonna res' here. no good goin' back.

dimly in the starlight. "nobody don' know my sins, nobody but jesus. he knows." 

tom got down on his knees. he put his hand on uncle john's forehead, and it was 

hot and dry. john brushed his hand away clumsily. 

"come on," tom pleaded. "come on now, uncle john." 
"ain't goin' go. jus' tar'd. gon' res' ri' here. ri' here." 

tom was very close. he put his fist against the point of uncle john's chin. he made 
a small practice arc twice, for distance; and then, with his shoulder in the swing, he hit 
the  chin  a  delicate  perfect  blow.  john's  chin  snapped  up  and  he  fell  backwards  and 
tried to sit up again. but tom was kneeling over him and as john got one elbow up 
tom hit him again. uncle john lay still on the ground. 

tom stood up and, bending, he lifted the loose sagging body and boosted it over his 
shoulder. he staggered under the loose weight. john's hanging hands

tom was panting when he came back to the hooverville, down from the road and to 
the joad truck. john was coming to; he struggled weakly. tom set him gently down on 
the ground. 

camp had been broken while he was gone. al passed the bundles up on the truck. 

the tarpaulin lay ready to bind over the load. 

al said, "he sure got a quick start." 
tom apologized. "i had to hit 'im a little to make 'im come. poor fella." 
"didn' hurt 'im?" ma asked. 
"don' think so. he's a-comin' out of it." 
uncle john was weakly sick on the ground. his spasms of vomiting came in little 

gasps. 

ma said, "i lef' a plate a potatoes for you, tom." 
tom chuckled. "i ain't just in the mood right now." 
pa called, "awright, al. sling up the tarp." 
the truck was loaded and ready. uncle john had gone to sleep. tom and al boosted 
and pulled him up on the load while winfield made a vomiting noise behind the truck 
and ruthie plugged her mouth with her hand to keep from squealing.

"you hit her too fast," he said. "next time you'll take it easy." 

"what is it, for god's sake?" 
the watchman laughed. "well, a lot of kids play in here. you tell folks to go slow 

and they're liable to forget. but let 'em hit that hump once and they don't forget." 
"oh! yeah. hope i didn' break nothin'. say—you got any room here for us?" 
"got one camp. how many of you?" 
tom counted on his fingers. "me an' pa an' ma, al an' rosasharn an' uncle john an'

"well, i guess we can fix you. got any camping stuff?" 
"got a big tarp an' beds." 
the watchman stepped up on the running board. "drive down the end of that line 

an' turn right. you'll be in number four sanitary unit." 

"what's that?" 
"toilets and showers and wash tubs." 
ma demanded, "you got wash tubs—running water?" 
"sure." 
"oh! praise god," said ma.

"yeah," said tom.

in the growing morning. 

when tom left her, ruthie gazed in at the door of the sanitary unit for a while. her 
courage was not strong without winfield to boast for. she put a bare foot in on the 
concrete floor, and then withdrew it. down the line a woman came out of a tent and 
started  a  fire  in  a  tin  camp  stove.  ruthie  took  a  few  steps  in  that  direction,  but  she 
could not leave. she crept to the entrance of the joad tent and looked in. on one side, 
lying on the ground, lay uncle john, his mouth open and his snores bubbling spittily in 
his throat. ma and pa were covered with a comfort, their heads in, away from the light. 
al was on the far side from uncle john, and his arm was flung over his eyes. near the 

front  of  the  tent  rose  of  sharon  and  winfield  lay,  and  there  was  the  space  where 
ruthie  had  been,  beside  winfield.  she  squatted  down  and  peered  in.  her  eyes 
remained on winfield's tow head; and as she looked, the little boy opened his eyes

ma said uneasily, "ya say a ladies' committee—comin' to my tent?" 
he nodded his head. "purty soon, i guess." 
"thank ya," said ma. she hurried out, and half ran to the tent. 
"pa," she called. "john, git up! you, al. git up an' git washed." startled sleepy eyes 
looked out at her. "all of you," ma cried. "you git up an' git your face washed. an' 
comb your hair." 

uncle john looked pale and sick. there was a red bruised place on his chin. 
pa demanded, "what's the matter?" 
"the committee," ma cried. "they's a committee—a ladies' committee a-comin' to 
visit. git up now, an' git washed. an' while we was a-sleepin' an' a-snorin', tom's went 
out an' got work. git up, now." 

they came sleepily out of the tent. uncle john staggered a little, and his face was

wasn't no chancet. but now we can. th'ow your dirty overhalls in the tent an' i'll wash' 
em out." 

pa  went  inside  the  tent,  and  in  a  moment  he  came  out  with  pale  blue,  washed 
overalls and shirt on. and he led the sad and startled children toward the sanitary unit. 

ma called after him, "scrounge aroun' good in their ears." 
uncle john came to the door of the men's side and looked out, and then he went 

back and sat on the toilet a long time and held his aching head in his hands. 

ma had taken up a panload of brown pone and was dropping spoons of dough in the 
grease for a second pan when a shadow fell on the ground beside her. she looked over 
her shoulder. a little man dressed all in white stood behind her—a man with a thin, 
brown,  lined  face  and  merry  eyes.  he  was  lean  as  a  picket.  his  white  clean  cloth

poured  coffee.  "know  what  a  fella's  doin'?  he's  buildin'  a  house  trailer.  right  over 
there, back a them tents. got beds an' a stove—ever'thing. jus' live in her. by god,

ma said, "i ruther have a little house. soon's we can, i want a little house." 
pa said, "al—after we've et, you an' me an' uncle john'll take the truck an' go out

pa said sternly, "you better get you some work 'fore you go a-tom-cattin'." 
uncle john came out of the toilet and moved slowly near. ma frowned at him.

pa tossed his coffee grounds out of his cup. 
"you got to quit that," ma said. "this here's a clean place." 
"you see she don't get so goddamn clean a fella can't live in her," pa said jealously. 

"hurry up, al. we're goin' out lookin' for a job." 

al wiped his mouth with his hand. "i'm ready," he said. 
pa turned to uncle john. "you a-comin'?" 
"yes, i'm a-comin'." 
"you don't look so good." 
"i ain't so good, but i'm comin'."

uncle john picked a stone from the ground and dropped it from his palm and picked 

it up again. he did not look at ma. "they ain't no work," he said. 

"you didn' look all over," ma said. 
"no, but they's signs out." 
"well, tom musta got work. he ain't been back." 
uncle john suggested, "maybe he went away—like connie, or like noah." 
ma glanced sharply at him, and then her eyes softened. "they's things you know,"

al winked rakishly at the girl, and he tripped on, striking his feet to the music and 

swaying his shoulders and swinging his arms. and the girl looked after him intently. 

pa put down his plate and stood up. "come on, john," he said; and he explained to 
ma, "we're a-gonna talk to some fellas about gettin' work." and pa and uncle john 
walked toward the manager's house. 

tom  worked  a  piece  of  store  bread  into  the  stew  gravy  on  his  plate  and  ate  the 
bread. he handed his plate to ma, and she put it in the bucket of hot water and washed 
it, and handed it to rose of sharon to wipe. "ain't you goin' to the dance?" ma asked.

led rose of sharon toward the sanitary unit. 

pa and uncle john squatted with a group of men by the porch of the office. "we

how much the pay was. said he didn' know exactly." 

ma said, "we're a-goin' to marysville. i don' care what the pay is. we're a-goin'." 
"it's too far," said tom. "we ain't got the money for gasoline. we couldn' get there.

uncle john said, "feller says they's cotton a-comin' in up north, near a place called 

tulare. that ain't very far, the feller says."

the evening dark came down and pa and uncle john squatted with the heads 
of families out by the office. they studied the night and the future. the little manager, 
in his white clothes, frayed and clean, rested his elbows on the porch rail. his face was 
drawn and tired.

tom and pa and al and uncle john walked with him down the dusty street and into 
the orchard, in among the peach trees. the narrow leaves were beginning to turn a pale 
yellow. the peaches were little globes of gold and red on the branches. among the 
trees were piles of empty boxes. the pickers scurried about, filling their buckets from 
the  branches,  putting  the  peaches  in  the  boxes,  carrying  the  boxes  to  the  checking

the  little  man  leaned  his  elbows  on  the  counter  and  looked  after  her  with  his 
surprised eyes. a plump tortoise shell cat leaped up on the counter and stalked lazily 
near to him. it rubbed sideways against his arms, and he reached out with his hand and 
pulled it against his cheek. the cat purred loudly, and the tip of its tail jerked back and 
forth. 

tom and al and pa and uncle john walked in from the orchard when the dusk 
was deep. their feet were a little heavy against the road.

pa struggled into his overalls and put on his rusty coat. he went sluggishly out the 

door, yawning and stretching. 

the children awakened and watched from under their blanket, like mice. pale light 
filled the room now, but colorless light, before the sun. ma glanced at the mattresses. 
uncle john was awake. al slept heavily. her eyes moved to tom. for a moment she 
peered at him, and then she moved quickly to him. his face was puffed and blue, and 
the  blood  was  dried  black  on  his  lips  and  chin.  the  edges  of  the  torn  cheek  were 
gathered and tight. 

"tom," she whispered, "what's the matter?" 
"sh!" he said. "don't talk loud. i got in a fight." 
"tom!" 
"i couldn' help it, ma." 
she knelt down beside him. "you in trouble?" 
he was a long time answering. "yeah," he said.

"what's a matter?" uncle john asked. 
pa clumped in. "they was open all right." he put a tiny bag of flour and his package 

of lard on the floor beside the stove. "'s'a matter?" he asked. 

tom braced himself on one elbow for a moment, and then he lay back. "jesus, i'm 

weak. i'm gonna tell ya once. so i'll tell all of ya. how 'bout the kids?"

tom  climbed  quickly,  and  dropped.  he  straightened  one  mattress  and  pulled  the 
second on top of him. pa bent it upwards, stood it sides up, so that the arch covered 
tom. he could see out between the side-boards of the truck. pa and al and uncle john 
loaded quickly, piled the blankets on top of tom's cave, stood the buckets against the 
sides, spread the last mattress behind. pots and pans, extra clothes, went in loose, for 
their boxes had been burned. they were nearly finished loading when a guard moved 
near, carrying his shotgun across his crooked arm.

around and bumped over the dirt street into the road. the feeble headlight jiggled over 
the way, and the right headlight blinked on and off from a bad connection. at every 
jolt the loose pots and pans in the truck-bed jangled and crashed.

"no," said al. "jus' goin', an' gettin' goddamn sick of it." 
"i ain't so tur'ble far from my time," rose of sharon said threateningly. "they better 

be a nice place for me." 

the night air was cold with the first sting of frost. beside the road the leaves were 
beginning to drop from the fruit trees. on the load, ma sat with her back against the 
truck side, and pa sat opposite, facing her. 

ma called, "you all right, tom?" 
his muffled voice came back, "kinda tight in here. we all

al  backed  and  filled  on  the  narrow  road,  until  he  had  reversed  his  direction.  he 
drove slowly back to the line of boxcars. the truck lights showed the cat-walks up to 
the wide car doors. the doors were dark. no one moved in the night. al shut off his 
lights.

uncle john helped the heavy girl to climb up over the tail board. ma piled the pots 

in a small space. the family lay wedged close together in the back of the truck.

sniffing and snorting, and moved slowly around the joad truck. the tinkle of moving

the joads had been lucky. they got in early enough to have a place in the boxcars. 
now the tents of the late-comers filled the little flat, and those who had the boxcars 
were old-timers, and in a way aristocrats.

uncle john fingered a pair of canvas gloves with yellow leather palms, tried them

motioned with her head toward uncle john.

"no, i ain't."

winfield retired to a rolled mattress, and he regarded the family cynically and dully. 
and he put himself in a good position of defense, for ruthie would attack him at the 
first opportunity, and he knew it. ruthie went quietly, heart-brokenly to the other side 
of the car. 

ma put a sheet of newspaper over the tin plate. "i'm a-goin' now," she said. 
"ain't you gonna eat nothin' yourself?" uncle john demanded. 
"later. when i come back. i wouldn' want nothin' now." ma walked to the open 

door; she steadied herself down the steep, cleated cat-walk. 

on the stream side of the boxcars, the tents were pitched close together, their guy 
ropes  crossing  one  another,  and  the  pegs  of  one  at  the  canvas  line  of  the  next.  the 
lights shone through the cloth, and all the chimneys belched smoke. men and women

"ruthie? what for?" 
"well, it wasn' her fault. got in a fight, an' says her brother'll lick that other girl's

went to the end boxcar and climbed the cleated walk. the low light of the lantern made 
gloomy shadows in the car. pa and uncle john and an elderly man squatted against the 
car wall. 

"hello," ma said. "evenin', mr. wainwright." 
he  raised  a  delicately  chiseled  face.  his  eyes  were  deep  under  the  ridges  of  his 
brows. his hair was blue-white and fine. a patina of silver beard covered his jaws and 
chin. "evenin', ma'am," he said. 

"we got pickin' tomorra," ma observed. "mile north. twenty acres."

"pa'll talk to al," said ma. "or if pa won't, i will." 
wainwright said, "good night, then, an' we sure thank ya." he went around the end 
of the curtain. they could hear him talking softly in the other end of the car, explaining 
the result of his embassy. 

ma listened a moment, and then, "you fellas," she said. "come over an' set here." 
pa and uncle john got heavily up from their squats. they sat on the mattress beside

"ever'thing  we  do—seems  to  me  is  aimed  right  at  goin'  on.  seems  that  way  to  me.

"they might be a good year nex' year, back home," said pa.

ruthie and winfield dripped in and threw their sticks on the pile. they turned to go 
again. "you stay," ma ordered. "stan' up close to the fire an' get dry." 

the afternoon was silver with rain, the roads glittered with water. hour by hour the 
cotton plants seemed to blacken and shrivel. pa and al and uncle john made trip after 
trip into the thickets and brought back loads of dead wood. they piled it near the door, 
until  the  heap  of  it  nearly  reached  the  ceiling,  and  at  last  they  stopped  and  walked 
toward the stove. streams of water ran from their hats to their shoulders. the edges of 
their coats dripped and their shoes squished as they walked.

ruthie and winfield tried to play for a while, and then they too relapsed into sullen 

inactivity, and the rain drummed down on the roof. 

on the third day the sound of the stream could be heard above the drumming rain. 
pa and uncle john stood in the open door and looked out on the rising stream. at both 
ends of the camp the water ran near to the highway, but at the camp it looped away so 
that the highway embankment surrounded the camp at the back and the stream closed it 
in on the front. and pa said, "how's it look to you, john? seems to me if that crick 
comes up, she'll flood us." 

uncle john opened his mouth and rubbed his bristling chin. "yeah," he said. "might

women looked at her and patted her gently and went back to their own cars. 

ma  had  a  good  fire  going  now,  and  all  her  utensils,  filled  with  water,  sat  on  the 

stove to heat. every little while pa looked in the car door. "all right?" he asked. 

"yeah! i think so," ma assured him. 
as it grew dark, someone brought out a flashlight to work by. uncle john plunged 

on, throwing mud on top of the wall. 

"you take it easy," pa said. "you'll kill yaself." 
"i can't he'p it. i can't stan' that yellin'. it's like—it's like when—" 
"i know," pa said. "but jus' take it easy." 
uncle john blubbered, "i'll run away. by god, i got to work or i'll run away." 
pa turned from him. "how's she stan' on the last marker?" 
the  man  with  the  flashlight  threw  the  beam  on  the  stick.  the  rain  cut  whitely

looking  into  the  headlight  beams.  and  the  rain  whipped  white  streaks  through  the 
lights. al went slowly around the truck, reached in, and turned off the ignition. 

when pa reached the cat-walk, he found the lower end floating. he stepped it down 

into the mud, under water. "think ya can make it awright, john?" he asked. 

"i'll be awright. jus' go on."

uncle john gathered his strength. "i dunno," he said apologetically. "legs give out. 

jus' give out." pa helped him along toward the cars. 

pa  cautiously  climbed  the  cat-walk  and  squeezed  himself  in  the  narrow  opening. 
the two lamps were turned low. ma sat on the mattress beside rose of sharon, and ma 
fanned her still face with a piece of cardboard. mrs. wainwright poked dry brush into 
the stove, and a dank smoke edged out around the lids and filled the car with a smell of

"how—is she?" pa asked. 
ma did not look up at him again. "awright, i think. sleepin'." 
the air was fetid and close with the smell of the birth. uncle john clambered in and 
held  himself  upright  against  the  side  of  the  car.  mrs.  wainwright  left  her  work  and 
came to pa. she pulled him by the elbow toward the corner of the car. she picked up a 
lantern and held it over an apple box in the corner. on a newspaper lay a blue shriveled 
little mummy. 

"never breathed," said mrs. wainwright softly. "never was alive."

rise. "come on! give it to me." 

"don'  wake  'em  up,"  mrs.  wainwright  said.  she  brought  the  apple  box  to  the 

doorway and straightened the sack decently over it. 

"well—what's your idear?" 
"we can tear out the side-boards of the truck an' build a kinda platform in here to 

pile our stuff an' to set up on."

the men were silent. pa said at last, "guess you're right. jus' cause sorra. 'gainst the

uncle john took the shovel in one hand. he slipped out the doorway into the slowly 
moving water, and it rose nearly to his waist before he struck bottom. he turned and 
settled the apple box under his other arm. 

pa said, "come on, al. le's git that lumber in." 
in the gray dawn light uncle john waded around the end of the car, past the joad

current and let it go. it settled low in the water, edged sideways, whirled around, and 
turned  slowly  over.  the  sack  floated  away,  and  the  box,  caught  in  the  swift  water, 
floated quickly away, out of sight, behind the brush. uncle john grabbed the shovel 
and went rapidly back to the boxcars. he sloshed down into the water and waded to the 
truck, where pa and al were working, taking down the one-by-six planks. 

pa looked over at him. "get it done?" 
"yeah." 
"well, look," pa said. "if you'll he'p al, i'll go down the store an' get some stuff to

pa slipped into the water and stood waiting. ma helped rose of sharon down from 
the platform and steadied her across the car. pa took her in his arms, held her as high as 
he could, and pushed his way carefully through the deep water, around the car, and to 
the highway. he set her down on her feet and held onto her. uncle john carried ruthie 
and followed. ma slid down into the water, and for a moment her skirts billowed out 
around her. 

"winfiel', set on my shoulder. al—we'll come back soon's the water's down. al—" 
she paused. "if—if tom comes—tell him we'll be back. tell him be careful. winfiel'!

suddenly the boy cried, "he's dyin', i tell you! he's starvin' to death, i tell you."

rose of sharon whispered, "will—will you all—go out?" the rain whisked lightly
