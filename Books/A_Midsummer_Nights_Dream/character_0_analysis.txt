Puck
Though there is little character development
in A Midsummer Night's Dream and no true protagonist,
critics generally point to Puck as the most important character
in the play. The mischievous, quick-witted sprite sets many of the
play's events in motion with his magic, by means of both deliberate
pranks on the human characters (transforming Bottom's head into
that of an ass) and unfortunate mistakes (smearing the love potion
on Lysander's eyelids instead of Demetrius's).

More important, Puck's capricious spirit, magical fancy,
fun-loving humor, and lovely, evocative language permeate the atmosphere of
the play. Wild contrasts, such as the implicit comparison between the
rough, earthy craftsmen and the delicate, graceful fairies, dominate A
Midsummer Night's Dream. Puck seems to illustrate many
of these contrasts within his own character: he is graceful but
not so saccharine as the other fairies; as Oberon's jester, he is
given to a certain coarseness, which leads him to transform Bottom's
head into that of an ass merely for the sake of enjoyment. He is
good-hearted but capable of cruel tricks. Finally, whereas most
of the fairies are beautiful and ethereal, Puck is often portrayed
as somewhat bizarre looking. Indeed, another fairy mentions that
some call Puck a "hobgoblin," a term whose connotations are decidedly
less glamorous than those of "fairy" (II.i.40).
