  orlando. as i remember, adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed
    me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st,
    charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there
    begins my sadness. my brother jaques he keeps at school, and
    report speaks goldenly of his profit. for my part, he keeps me
    rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at
    home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my
    birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? his horses are
    bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding,
    they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly
    hir'd; but i, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth

  amiens. happy is your grace,
    that can translate the stubbornness of fortune
    into so quiet and so sweet a style.

  duke senior. come, shall we go and kill us venison?
    and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
    being native burghers of this desert city,
    should, in their own confines, with forked heads
    have their round haunches gor'd.

  first lord. indeed, my lord,
    the melancholy jaques grieves at that;
    and, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
    than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
    to-day my lord of amiens and myself
    did steal behind him as he lay along
    under an oak whose antique root peeps out
    upon the brook that brawls along this wood!
    to the which place a poor sequest'red stag,
    that from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,
    did come to languish; and, indeed, my lord,
    the wretched animal heav'd forth such groans

 that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
    almost to bursting; and the big round tears
    cours'd one another down his innocent nose
    in piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool,
    much marked of the melancholy jaques,
    stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook,
    augmenting it with tears.

  duke senior. but what said jaques?
    did he not moralize this spectacle?

  first lord. o, yes, into a thousand similes.
    first, for his weeping into the needless stream:
    'poor deer,' quoth he 'thou mak'st a testament
    as worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
    to that which had too much.' then, being there alone,
    left and abandoned of his velvet friends:
    ''tis right'; quoth he 'thus misery doth part
    the flux of company.' anon, a careless herd,
    full of the pasture, jumps along by him

  and never stays to greet him. 'ay,' quoth jaques
    'sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;
    'tis just the fashion. wherefore do you look
    upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
    thus most invectively he pierceth through
    the body of the country, city, court,
    yea, and of this our life; swearing that we
    are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what's worse,
    to fright the animals, and to kill them up
    in their assign'd and native dwelling-place.

  duke senior. and did you leave him in this contemplation?

  amiens. my voice is ragged; i know i cannot please you.

  jaques. i do not desire you to please me; i do desire you to sing.
    come, more; another stanzo. call you 'em stanzos?

  amiens. what you will, monsieur jaques.

  jaques. nay, i care not for their names; they owe me nothing.
    will you sing?

  amiens. more at your request than to please myself.

  jaques. well then, if ever i thank any man, i'll thank you; but
    that they call compliment is like th' encounter of two dog-apes;
    and when a man thanks me heartily, methinks have given him a
    penny, and he renders me the beggarly thanks. come, sing; and you
    that will not, hold your tongues.

a table set out. enter duke senior, amiens, and lords, like outlaws


  duke senior. i think he be transform'd into a beast;
    for i can nowhere find him like a man.

  first lord. my lord, he is but even now gone hence;
    here was he merry, hearing of a song.

  duke senior. if he, compact of jars, grow musical,
    we shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
    go seek him; tell him i would speak with him.

                         enter jaques


  first lord. he saves my labour by his own approach.

  duke senior. why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
    that your poor friends must woo your company?
    what, you look merrily!

  jaques. a fool, a fool! i met a fool i' th' forest,
    a motley fool. a miserable world!
    as i do live by food, i met a fool,
    who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,
    and rail'd on lady fortune in good terms,
    in good set terms- and yet a motley fool.

    and after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
    and so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
    and then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
    and thereby hangs a tale.' when i did hear
    the motley fool thus moral on the time,
    my lungs began to crow like chanticleer
    that fools should be so deep contemplative;
    and i did laugh sans intermission
    an hour by his dial. o noble fool!
    a worthy fool! motley's the only wear.

  duke senior. what fool is this?

  jaques. o worthy fool! one that hath been a courtier,
    and says, if ladies be but young and fair,
    they have the gift to know it; and in his brain,
    which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
    after a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
    with observation, the which he vents
    in mangled forms. o that i were a fool!
    i am ambitious for a motley coat.

  duke senior. thou shalt have one.

  jaques. it is my only suit,
    provided that you weed your better judgments

    invest me in my motley; give me leave
    to speak my mind, and i will through and through
    cleanse the foul body of th' infected world,
    if they will patiently receive my medicine.

  duke senior. fie on thee! i can tell what thou wouldst do.

  jaques. what, for a counter, would i do but good?

  duke senior. most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;
    for thou thyself hast been a libertine,
    as sensual as the brutish sting itself;
    and all th' embossed sores and headed evils

    his folly to the mettle of my speech?
    there then! how then? what then? let me see wherein
    my tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
    then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,

  jaques. why, i have eat none yet.

  jaques. of what kind should this cock come of?

  duke senior. art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress?
    or else a rude despiser of good manners,
    that in civility thou seem'st so empty?

  orlando. you touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
    of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
    of smooth civility; yet arn i inland bred,
    and know some nurture. but forbear, i say;

    more than your force move us to gentleness.

  duke senior. thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
    this wide and universal theatre
    presents more woeful pageants than the scene
    wherein we play in.

  jaques. all the world's a stage,
    and all the men and women merely players;
    they have their exits and their entrances;
    and one man in his time plays many parts,
    his acts being seven ages. at first the infant,
    mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
    then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
    and shining morning face, creeping like snail
    unwillingly to school. and then the lover,
    sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
    made to his mistress' eyebrow.

    sadness.

  rosalind. a traveller! by my faith, you have great reason to be
    sad. i fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's; then
    to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and
    poor hands.

  jaques. yes, i have gain'd my experience.

                        enter orlando


  rosalind. and your experience makes you sad. i had rather have a
    fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad- and to
    travel for it too.

  orlando. good day, and happiness, dear rosalind!

  jaques. nay, then, god buy you, an you talk in blank verse.

  rosalind. farewell, monsieur traveller; look you lisp and wear
    strange suits, disable all the benefits of your own country, be

    seeming, audrey- as thus, sir. i did dislike the cut of a certain
    courtier's beard; he sent me word, if i said his beard was not
    cut well, he was in the mind it was. this is call'd the retort
    courteous. if i sent him word again it was not well cut, he would
    send me word he cut it to please himself. this is call'd the q

    this is call'd the reply churlish. if again it was not well cut,
    he would answer i spake not true. this is call'd the reproof
    valiant. if again it was not well cut, he would say i lie.
    this is call'd the countercheck quarrelsome. and so to the lie
    circumstantial and the lie direct.

  jaques. and how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?

    he durst not give me the lie direct; and so we measur'd swords
    and parted.

ant; the fifth, the
    countercheck quarrelsome; the sixth, the lie with circumstance;
    the seventh, the lie direct. all these you may avoid but the lie
    direct; and you may avoid that too with an if. i knew when seven
    justices could not take up a quarrel; but when the parties were
    met themselves, one of them thought but of an if, as: 'if you
    said so, then i said so.' and they shook hands, and swore
    brothers. your if is the only peace-maker; much virtue in if.

  jaques. is not this a rare fellow, my lord?
    he's as good at any thing, and yet a fool.
