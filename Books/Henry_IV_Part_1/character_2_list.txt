Hotspur - 
                	The
son and heir of the Earl of Northumberland and the nephew of the
Earl of Worcester. Hotspur's real name is Henry Percy (he is also
called Harry or Percy), but he has earned his nickname from his
fierceness in battle and hastiness of action. Hotspur is a member
of the powerful Percy family of the North, which helped bring King
Henry IV to power but now feels that the king has forgotten his
debt to them. In Shakespeare's account, Hotspur is the same age
as Prince Harry and becomes his archrival. Quick-tempered and impatient, Hotspur
is obsessed with the idea of honor and glory to the exclusion of
all other qualities.
