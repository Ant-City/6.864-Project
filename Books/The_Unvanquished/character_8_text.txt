i had to hear about the railroad too; possibly it was more the need to keep even with
ringo (or even ahead of him, since i had seen the railroad when it was a railroad, which
he had not) than a boy's affinity for smoke and fury and thunder and speed. we sat there
in that slave cabin partitioned, like louvinia's cabin at home, into two rooms by that
suspended quilt beyond which aunt louisa and granny were already in bed and where
cousin denny should have been too except for the evening's dispensation he had
received, listening too who did not need to hear it again since he had been there to see it
when it happened;--we sat there, ringo and i, listening to cousin drusilla and staring at

he had known what was going to happen, he would still have egged her on to do it. and
ringo and i tried--we tried--but granny just sat there before the fire--it was cold in the
cabin now--with her arms folded in the shawl and with that look on her face when she had
quit either arguing or listening to you at all, saying just this one time more and that even a
rogue will be honest for enough pay. it was christmas; we had just heard from aunt louisa
at hawkhurst and found out where drusilla was; she had been missing from home for
almost a year now, and at last aunt louisa found out that she was with father away in
carolina, like she had told me, riding with the troop like she was a man.

skirmish at sartoris

when i think of that day, of father's old troop on their horses drawn up facing the house,
and father and drusilla on the ground with that carpet bagger voting box in front of them,
and opposite them the women--aunt louisa, mrs. habersham and all the others--on the
porch and the two sets of them, the men and the women, facing one another like they
were both waiting for a bugle to sound the charge, i think i know the reason. i think it was
because father's troop (like all the other southern soldiers too), even though they had
surrendered and said that they were whipped, were still soldiers. maybe from the old habit
of doing everything as one man; maybe when you have lived for four years in a world
ordered complete

to quit that world: maybe the danger and the fighting are the reasons, because men have
been pacifists for every reason under the sun except to avoid danger and fighting. and so
now father's troop and all the other men in jefferson, and aunt louisa and mrs.
habersham and all the women in jefferson were actually enemies for the reason that the
men had given in and admitted that they belonged to the united states but the women
had never surrendered.

was just before christmas in 1864, after the yankees had burned jefferson and gone away,
and we didn't even know for sure if the war was still going on or not. all we knew was that
for three years the country had been full of yankees, and then all of a sudden they were
gone and there were no me

ruined plantations and fields inhabited only by women. ringo and i were fifteen then; we
felt almost exactly like we had to eat and sleep and change our clothes in a hotel built
only for ladies and children.

the envelope was worn and dirty and it had been opened once and then glued
back, but we could still make out hawkhurst, gihon county, alabama on it even though
we did not recognise aunt louisa's hand at first. it was addressed to granny; it was six
pages cut with scissors from wallpaper and written on both sides with pokeberry juice and i
thought of that night eighteen months ago when drusilla and i stood outside the cabin at
hawkhurst and listened to the niggers passing in the road, the night when she told me
about the dog, about keeping the dog quiet, and then asked me to ask father to let her
join his troop and ride with him. but i didn't tell father. maybe i forgot it. then the y

went away, and father and his troop went away too. then, six months later, we had a
letter from him about how they were fighting in carolina, and a month after that we had
one from aunt louisa that drusilla was gone too, a short letter on the wallpaper that you
could see where aunt louisa had cried in the pokeberry juice about how she did not know
where drusilla was but that she had expected the worst ever since drusilla had
deliberately tried to unsex herself by refusing to feel any natural grief at the death in battle
not only of her affianced husband but of her own father and that she took it for granted
that drusilla was with us and though she did not expect drusilla to take any steps herself to
relieve a mother's anxiety, she hoped that granny would. but we didn't know wher

not only taken along with them all living men blue and gray and white and black, but
even one young girl who had happened to try to look and act like a man after her
sweetheart was killed.

so then the next letter came. only granny wasn't there to read it because she was
dead then (it was the time when grumby doubled back past jefferson and so ringo and i
spent one night at home and found the letter when mrs. compson had sent it out) and so
for a while ringo and i couldn't make out what aunt louisa was trying to tell us. this one
was on the same wallpaper too, six pages this time, only aunt louisa hadn't cried in the
pokeberry juice this time: ringo said because she must have been writing too fast:

dear sister:

i think this will be news to you as it was to me though i both hope and pray it will not
be the heartrending shock to you it was to me as naturally it cannot since you are only an
aunt while i am the mother. but it is not myself i am thinking of since i am a woman, a

e was not enough
to preserve his sister's good name--

while he had to light another pineknot and all the farther we had got was how when
gavin breckbridge was killed at shiloh before he and drusilla had had time to marry, there
had been reserved for drusilla the highest destiny of a southern woman--to be the bride--
widow of a lost cause--and how drusilla had not only thrown that away, she had not only
become a lost woman and a shame to her father's memory but she was now living in a
word that aunt louisa would not even repeat but that granny knew what it was, though
at least thank god that father and drusilla were not actually any blood kin, it being
father's wife who was drusilla's cousin by blood and not father himself. so then ringo lit the
other pine-knot and then we put the sheets of wallpaper down on the floor and then we
found out what it was: how drusilla had been gone for six months and no word from her
except she was alive, and then one night she walked into the cabin where aunt louis

and denny were (and now it had a line drawn under it, like this:) in the garments not alone
of a man but of a common private soldier and told them how she had been a member of
father's troop for six months, bivouacking at night surrounded by sleeping men and not
even bothering to put up the tent for her and father except when the weather was bad,
and how drusilla not only showed neither shame nor remorse but actually pretended she
did not even know what aunt louisa was talking about; how when aunt louisa told her
that she and father must marry at once, drusilla said, "can't you understand that i am tired
of burying husbands in this war? that i am riding in cousin john's troop not to find a man
but to hurt yankees?" and how aunt louisa said:

the third letter did not come to us at all. it came to mrs. compson. drusilla and father were

hawkhurst and her face sunburned from riding in the weather and her body thin from living
like soldiers lived. after granny died ringo and louvinia and i all slept in the cabin, but
after father came ringo and louvinia moved back to the other cabin with joby and now
father and i slept on ringo's and my pallet and drusilla slept in the bed behind the quilt
curtain where granny used to sleep. and so one night i remembered aunt louisa's letter
and i showed it to drusilla and father, and father found out that drusilla had not written to
tell aunt louisa where she was and father said she must, and so one day mrs. compson
came out with the third letter. drusilla and ringo and louvinia too were down in the
bottom at the sawmill and i saw that one too, on the wallpaper with the pokeberry juice
and the juice not cried on this time either, and this the first time mrs. compson had come
out since granny died and not even getting out

drusilla would come out of the house or from around the corner it would not be just a thin
sunburned girl in a man's shirt and pants but maybe something like a tame panther or
bear. this one sounded just like the others: about how aunt louisa was addressing a
stranger to herself but not a stranger to granny and that there were times when the good
name of one family was the good name of all and that she naturally did not expect mrs.
compson to move out and live with father and drusilla because even that would be too
late now to preserve the appearance of that which had never existed anyway. but that
mrs. compson was a woman too, aunt louisa believed, a southern woman too, and had
suffered too, aunt louisa didn't doubt, only she did h

good deal older than granny and the only husband she had ever had had been locked
up for crazy a long time ago because in the slack part of the afternoons he would gather
up eight or ten little niggers from the quarters and line them up across the creek from him
with sweet potatoes on their heads and he would shoot the potatoes off with a rifle; he
would tell them he might miss a potato but he wasn't going to miss a nigger, and so they

out of that one too and i still didn't know what aunt louisa was talking about and i didn't
believe that mrs. compson knew either.

before and that granny never had been to see that i knew of. because mrs. compson
didn't stay, she didn't even get out of the surrey, sitting there kind of drawn up under the
shawl and looking at me and then at the cabin like she didn't know just what might come
out of it or out from behind it. then she begun to tap the nigger driver on his head with the

in the morning until when he would get back, sometimes late at night. because they were

busy; we just saw father at night and sometimes then ringo and i and even drusilla would
take one look at him and we wouldn't ask him any questions. so it didn't take them long,
because drusilla was already beaten; she was just marking time without knowing it from
that afternoon when the fourteen ladies got into the surreys and buggies and went back
to town until one afternoon about two months later when we heard denny hollering even
before the wagon came in the gates, and aunt louisa sitting on one of the trunks (that's
what beat drusilla: the trunks. they had her dresses in them that she hadn't worn in three
years; ringo never had seen her in a dress until aunt louisa came) in mourning even to the
crepe bow on her umbrella handle, that hadn't worn mourning when we were at
hawkhurst two years ago though uncle dennison was just as dead then as he was now,

she came to the cabin and got out of the wagon, already crying and talking just like the

think it will do any good though i had prayed until the very last that this boy's innocence

sitting in granny's chair in the middle of the room, without even
laying down the umbrella or taking her bonnet off, looking at the pallet where father and
i slept and then at the quilt nailed to the rafter to make a room for drusilla, dabbing at her
mouth with a handkerchief that made the whole cabin smell like dead roses. and then
drusilla came in from the mill, in the muddy brogans and the sweaty shirt and overalls and
her hair sunburned and full of sawdust, and aunt louisa looked at her once and began to
cry again, saying, "lost, lost. thank god in his mercy that dennison hawk was taken before
he lived to see what i see."

watched her run out of the cabin in it and run down the hill toward the spring while we
were waiting for father. and he came and walked into the cabin where aunt louisa was
still sitting in granny's chair with the handkerchief before her mouth. "this is a pleasant
surprise, miss louisa," father said.

joby and ringo, i didn't even see drusilla except at mealtime. and we were busy getting
the timber out, and now everybody was talking about the election and how father had
told the two burdens before all the men in town that the election would never be held with
cash benbow or any other nigger in it and how the burdens had dared him to stop it. and
besides, the other cabin would be full of jefferson ladies all day; you would have thought
that drusilla was mrs. habersham's daughter and not aunt louisa's. they would begin to
arrive right after breakfast and stay all day, so that at supper aunt louisa would sit in her
black mourning except for the bonnet and umbrella, with a wad of some kind of black
knitting she carried around with her and that never got finished and the folded
handkerchief handy in her belt (only she ate fine; she ate more than father even because
the election was just a week off and i reckon he was thinking about the burdens) and
refusing to speak to anybody except denny; a

than i was, but she had let aunt louisa and mrs. habersham choose the game and she
had beat them both until that night when aunt louisa went behind her back and chose a
game she couldn't beat. i was coming up to supper; i heard them inside the cabin before i
could stop: "can't you believe me?" drusilla said. "can't you understand that in the troop i
was just another man and not much of one at that, and since we came home here i am
just another mouth for john to feed, just a cousin of john's wife and not much older than

then drusilla broke; they beat her. because she was strong; she wasn't much older

but she was beaten, like a

s soon as she let them put the dress on her she was

progressed:

man, day and night for a year, running about the country with no guard nor check of any
sort upon--do you take me for a complete fool?" so that night aunt louisa beat her; we
had just sat down to supper when aunt louisa looked at me like she had been waiting for
the noise of the bench to stop: "bayard, i do not ask your forgiveness for this because it is
your burden too; you are an innocent victim as well as dennison and i--" then she looked
at father, thrust back in granny's chair (the only chair we had) in her black dress, the black
wad of knitting beside her plate. "colonel sartoris," she said, "i am a woman; i must request
that the husband whom i have lost and the man son which i have not would demand,

i got out. i moved fast; i heard the light sharp sound when drusilla's head went
down between her flungout arms on the table, and the sound the bench made when
father got up too; i passed him standing beside drusilla with his hand on her head. "they
have beat you, drusilla," he said.

mrs. habersham got there before we had finished breakfast the next morning. i don't
know how aunt louisa got word in to her so quick. but there she was, and she and aunt
louisa set the wedding for the day after tomorrow. i don't reckon they even knew that that
was the day father had told the burdens cash benbow would never be elected marshal in
jefferson. i don't reckon they paid any more attention to it than if all the men had decided
that day after tomorrow all the clocks in jefferson were to be set back or up an hour.
maybe they didn't even know there was to be an election, that all the , men i

at the
burdens already had their nigger voters camped in a cotton gin on the edge of town
under guard. i don't reckon they even cared. because like father said, women cannot
believe that anything can be right or wrong or even be very important that can be
decided by a lot of little scraps of scribbled paper dropped into a box.

it was to be a big wedding; all jefferson was to be invited and mrs. habersham
planning to bring the three bottles of madeira she had been saving for five years now
when aunt louisa began to cry again. but they caught on quick now; now all of them
were patting aunt louisa's hands and giving her vinegar to smell and mrs. habersham
saying, "of course. you poor thing. a public wedding now, after a year, would be a public
notice of the . . ." so they decided it would be a reception, because mrs. habersham said
how a reception could be held for a bridal couple at any time, even ten years later. so
drusilla was to ride into town, meet father and be married as quick and quiet as

possible,
with just me and one other for witnesses to make it legal; none of the ladies themselves
would even be present. then they would come back home and we would have the
reception.

tablecloths and silver like for a church supper. mrs. habersham brought a veil and a
wreath and they all helped drusilla to dress, only aunt louisa made drusilla put on father's

so they began to arrive early the next morning, with baskets of food and

"who?" aunt louisa hollered. "where have you been?"
"to town!" benny hollered. "them two burdens! they kilt um!"
"who killed them?" aunt louisa hollered.
"drusilla and cousin john!" benny hollered. then louvinia said how aunt louisa

big riding cloak over the veil and wreath too, and ringo brought the horses up, all curried
and brushed, and i helped drusilla on with aunt louisa and the others all watching from
the porch. but i didn't know that ringo was missing when we started, not even when i
heard aunt louisa h

ollering for benny while we rode down the drive. it was louvinia that
told about it, about how after we left the ladies set and decorated the table and spread
the wedding breakfast and how they were all watching the gate and aunt louisa still
hollering for benny now and then when they saw ringo and benny come up the drive
riding double on one of the mules at a gallop, with benny's eyes round as^ doorknobs and
already hollering. "they kilt um! they kilt um!"




hollered sure enough.
"so you mean to tell me that drusilla and that man are not married yet?"


because we didn't have time. maybe drusilla and father would have, but when we
came into the square we saw the crowd of niggers kind of huddled beyond the hotel door
with si

e, and rode on up to the cabin where the buggies
and surreys were standing, and drusilla passed the ballot box to me and got down and
took the box again and was walking toward the cabin when she stopped dead still. i
reckon she and i both remembered at the same time and i reckon that even the others,
the men, knew all of a sudden that something was wrong. because like father said, i
reckon women don't ever surrender: not only victory, but not even defeat. because that's
how we were stopped when aunt louisa and the other ladies came out on the porch, and
then father shoved past me and jumped down beside drusilla. but aunt louisa never even
looked at him.
"so you are not married," she said.

"i forgot," drusilla said.

"you forgot? you forgot?"

"i . . ." drusilla said. "we . . ."


now aunt louisa looked at us; she looked along the line of us sitting there in our
saddles; she looked at me too just like she did at the others, like she had never seen me
before. "and who are these, pray? your wedding

"they came to vote," drusilla said.


"to vote," aunt louisa said. "ah. to vote. since you have forced your mother and
brother to live under a roof of license and adultery you think you can also force them--to
live in a polling booth refuge from violence and bloodshed, do you? bring me that box."
but drusilla didn't move, standing there in her torn dress and the ruined veil and the twisted
wreath hanging from her hair by a few pins. aunt louisa came down the steps; we didn't
know what she was going to do: we just sat there and watched her snatch the polling box
from drusilla and fling it across the yard. "come into the house," she said. "no," drusilla said.

mrs. habersham came and led her back into the house. then they voted. that didn't take
long either. they set the box on the sawchunk where louvinia washed, and ringo got the
pokeberry juice and an old piece of window shade, and they cut it into ballots. "let

 all
who want the honorable cassius q. benbow to be marshal of jefferson write yes on his
ballot; opposed, no," father said.
"and i'll do the writing and save some more time," george wyatt said. so he made

a pack of the ballots and wrote them against his saddle and fast as he would write them
the men would take them and drop them into the box and drusilla would call their names
out. we could hear aunt louisa still crying inside the cabin and we could see the other
ladies watching us through the window. it didn't take long. "you needn't bother to count
them," george said. "they all voted no."

drusilla in the torn wedding dress and the crooked wreath and veil standing beside the

came back high and thin and ragged and fierce, like when the yankees used to hear it
out of the smoke and the galloping: "yaaaaay, drusilla!
