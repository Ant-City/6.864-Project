[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER]'s life story is at the heart of frankenstein. a young
swiss boy, he grows up in geneva reading the works of the ancient
and outdated alchemists, a background that serves him ill when he
attends university at ingolstadt. there he learns about modern science
and, within a few years, masters all that his professors have to
teach him. he becomes fascinated with the "secret of life," discovers
it, and brings a hideous monster to life. the monster proceeds to
kill victor's youngest brother, best friend, and wife; he also indirectly
causes the deaths of two other innocents, including victor's father.
though torn by remorse, shame, and guilt, victor refuses to admit
to anyone the horror of what he has created, even as he sees the
ramifications of his creative act spiraling out of control.

victor changes over the course of the novel from an innocent youth
fascinated by the prospects of science into a disillusioned, guilt-ridden
man determined to destroy the fruits of his arrogant scientific
endeavor. whether as a result of his desire to attain the godlike
power of creating new life or his avoidance of the public arenas in
which science is usually conducted, victor is doomed by a lack of humanness.
he cuts himself off from the world and eventually commits himself
entirely to an animalistic obsession with revenging himself upon
the monster.
at the end of the novel, having chased his creation ever
northward, victor relates his story to robert walton and then dies.
with its multiple narrators and, hence, multiple perspectives, the
novel leaves the reader with contrasting interpretations of victor:
classic mad scientist, transgressing all boundaries without concern,
or brave adventurer into unknown scientific lands, not to be held responsible
for the consequences of his explorations.
