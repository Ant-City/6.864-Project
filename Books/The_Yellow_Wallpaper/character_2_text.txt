tain lights,
and not clearly then.

but in the places where it isn't faded and where the sun is just so--i
can see a strange, provoking, formless sort of figure, that seems to
skulk about behind that silly and conspicuous front design.

there's sister on the stairs!


well, the fourth of july is over! the people are gone and i am tired
out. john thought it might do me good to see a little company, so we
just had mother and nellie and the children down for a week.

of course i didn't do a thing. jennie sees to everything now.

but it tired me all the same.

john says if i don't pick up faster he shall send me to weir mitchell in
the fall.

but i don't want to go there at all. i had a friend who was in his hands
once, and she says he is just like john and my brother, only more so!

besides, it is such an undertaking to go so far.

i don't feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for anything,
and i'm getting dreadfully fretful and querulous.

i cry at nothing, and cry most of the tim

of course i don't when john is here, or anybody else, but when i am
alone.

and i am alone a good deal just now. john is kept in town very often by
serious cases, and jennie is good and lets me alone when i want her to.

so i walk a little in the garden or down that lovely lane, sit on the
porch under the roses, and lie down up here a good deal.

i'm getting really fond of the room in spite of the wall-paper. perhaps
because of the wall-paper.

it dwells in my mind so!

i lie here on this great immovable bed--it is nailed down, i
believe--and follow that pattern about by the hour. it is as good as
gymnastics, i assure you. i start, we'll say, at the bottom, down in

better in the evening when you are here, but it is worse in the morning
when you are away!"

"bless her little heart!" said he with a big hug, "she shall be as sick
as she pleases! but now let's improve the shining hours by going to
sleep, and talk about it in the morning!"

"and you won't go away?" i asked gloomily.

"why, how can i, dear? it is only three weeks more and then we will
take a nice little trip of a few days while jennie is getting the house
ready. really dear you are better!"

"better in body perhaps--" i began, and stopped short, for he sat up
straight and looked at me with such a stern, reproachful look that i
could not say another word.

"my darling," said he, "i beg of you, for my sake and for our child's
sake, as well as for your own, that you will never for one instant
let that idea enter your mind! there is nothing so dangerous, so
fascinating, to a temperament like yours. it is a false and foolish

, quiet. i fancy it is the pattern that keeps
her so still. it is so puzzling. it keeps me quiet by the hour.

i lie down ever so much now. john says it is good for me, and to sleep
all i can.

indeed he started the habit by making me lie down for an hour after each
meal.

it is a very bad habit i am convinced, for you see i don't sleep.

and that cultivates deceit, for i don't tell them i'm awake--o no!

the fact is i am getting a little afraid of john.

he seems very queer sometimes, and even jennie has an inexplicable look.

it strikes me occasionally, just as a scientific hypothesis,--that
perhaps it is the paper!

i have watched john when he did not know i was looking, and come into
the room suddenly on the most innocent excuses, and i've caught him
several times looking at the paper! and jennie too. i caught jennie with
her hand on it once.

she didn't know i was in the room, and when i asked her in a quiet, a
very quiet voice, with the most restrained manner possible, what she
was doi

turn!

i have watched her sometimes away off in the open country, creeping as
fast as a cloud shadow in a high wind.

if only that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one! i mean
to try it, little by little.

i have found out another funny thing, but i shan't tell it this time! it
does not do to trust people too much.

there are only two more days to get this paper off, and i believe john
is beginning to notice. i don't like the look in his eyes.

and i heard him ask jennie a lot of professional questions about me. she
had a very good report to give.

she said i slept a good deal in the daytime.

john knows i don't sleep very well at night, for all i'm so quiet!

he asked me all sorts of questions, too, and pretended to be very loving
and kind.

as if i couldn't see through him!

still, i don't wonder he acts so, sleeping under this paper for three
months.

it only interests me, but i feel sure john and jennie are secretly
affected by it.


hurrah! this is the las

t day, but it is enough. john is to stay in town
over night, and won't be out until this evening.

jennie wanted to sleep with me--the sly thing! but i told her i should
undoubtedly rest better for a night all alone.

that was clever, for really i wasn't alone a bit! as soon as it was
moonlight and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern, i
got up and ran to help her.

i pulled and she shook, i shook and she pulled, and before morning we
had peeled off yards of that paper.

a strip about as high as my head and half around the room.

and then when the sun came and that awful pattern beg

an to laugh at me,
i declared i would finish it to-day!

we go away to-morrow, and they are moving all my furniture down again to
leave things as they were before.

jennie looked at the wall in amazement, but i told her merrily that i
did it out of pure spite at the vicious thing.

she laughed and said she wouldn't mind doing it herself, but i must not
get tired.

how she betrayed herself that time!

but i am here, and no person touches this paper but me--not alive!

she tried to get me out of the room--it was too patent! but i said it
was so quiet and empty and clean now that i believed i would lie down
again and sleep all i could; and not to wake me even for di

 great bedstead nailed down, with the
canvas mattress we found on it.

we shall sleep downstairs to-night, and take the boat home to-morrow.

i quite enjoy the room, now it is bare again.

how those children did tear about here!

this bedstead is fairly gnawed!

but i must get to work.

i have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path.

i don't want to go out, and i don't want to have anybody come in, till
john comes.

i want to astonish him.

i've got a rope up here that even jennie did not find. if that woman
does get out, and tries to get away, i can tie her!

but i forgot i could not reach far without anything to stand on!

this bed will not move!

i tried to lift and push it until i was lame, and then i got so angry i
bit off a little piece at one corner--but it hurt my teeth.

then i peeled off all the paper i could reach standing on the floor.
it sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it! all those strangled
heads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths jus

sconstrued.

i don't like to look out of the windows even--there are so many of those
creeping women, and they creep so fast.

i wonder if they all come out of that wall-paper as i did?

but i am securely fastened now by my well-hidden rope--you don't get me
out in the road there!

i suppose i shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes
night, and that is hard!

it is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as i
please!

i don't want to go outside. i won't, even if jennie asks me to.

for outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green
instead of yellow.

but here i can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits in
that long smooch around the wall, so i cannot lose my way.

why there's john at the door!

it is no use, young man, you can't open it!

how he does call and pound!

now he's crying for an axe.

it would be a shame to break down that beautiful door!

"john dear!" said i in the gentlest voice, "the key is down by the front
