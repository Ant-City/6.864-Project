Theodor Kaluza (1885-1954) - 
A German mathematician. In 1919, Kaluza proposed
that the universe might contain more than three spatial dimensions.
Kaluza's theory was considered outlandish, and it took Einstein
several years to consider Kaluza's theory seriously, but string theorists
today find it remarkably prescient.
