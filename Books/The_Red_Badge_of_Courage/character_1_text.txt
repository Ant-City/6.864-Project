"oh, you think you know--" began the loud soldier with scorn.

the other turned savagely upon him. they had a rapid altercation, in which they fastened upon each other various strange epithets.

the youth at last interrupted them. "did you ever think you might run yourself, jim?" he asked. on concluding the sentence he laughed as if he had meant to aim a joke. the loud soldier also giggled.

the tall private waved his hand. "well," said he profoundly, "i've thought it might get too hot for jim conklin in some of them scrimmages, and if a whole lot of boys started and run, why, i s'pose i'd start and run. and if i once started to run, i'd run like the devil, and no mistake. but if everybody was a-standing and a-fighting, why, i'd stand and fight. be jiminey, i would. i'll bet on it."

"huh!" said the loud one.

the youth of this tale felt gratitude for these words of his comrade. he had feared that all of the untried men possessed great and correct confidence. he now was in a measure reassure

uth was known," he added, more soberly, "they've licked us about every clip up to now; but this time--this time--we'll lick 'em good!"

"i thought you was objecting to this march a little while ago," said the youth coldly.

"oh, it wasn't that," explained the other. "i don't mind marching, if there's going to be fighting at the end of it. what i hate is this getting moved here and moved there, with no good coming of it, as far as i can see, excepting sore feet and damned short rations."

"well, jim conklin says we'll get plenty of fighting this time."

"he's right for once, i guess, though i can't see how it come. this time we're in for a big battle, and we've got the best end of it, certain sure. gee rod! how we will thump 'em!"

he arose and began to pace to and fro excitedly. the thrill of his enthusiasm made him walk with an elastic step. he was sprightly, vigorous, fiery in his belief in success. he looked into the future with clear proud eye, and he swore with the air of an old soldier.

 stiffness in the movements of his body, as if he were taking infinite care not to arouse the passion of his wounds. as he went on, he seemed always looking for a place, like one who goes to choose a grave.

something in the gesture of the man as he waved the bloody and pitying soldiers away made the youth start as if bitten. he yelled in horror. tottering forward he laid a quivering hand upon the man's arm. as the latter slowly turned his waxlike features toward him the youth screamed:

"gawd! jim conklin!"

the tall soldier made a little commonplace smile. "hello, henry," he said.

the youth swayed on his legs and glared strangely. he stuttered and stammered. "oh, jim--oh, jim--oh, jim--"

the tall soldier held out his gory hand. there was a curious red and black combination of new blood and old blood upon it. "where yeh been, henry?" he asked. he continued in a monotonous voice, "i thought mebbe yeh got keeled over. there 's been thunder t' pay t'-day. i was worryin' about it a good deal."

 commonplace way. "they all seem t' think we've got 'em jest where we want 'em."

"i don't know about that," the youth replied. "what i seen over on th' right makes me think it was th' other way about. from where i was, it looked as if we was gettin' a good poundin' yestirday."

"d'yeh think so?" inquired the friend. "i thought we handled 'em pretty rough yestirday."

"not a bit," said the youth. "why, lord, man, you didn't see nothing of the fight. why!" then a sudden thought came to him. "oh! jim conklin's dead."

his friend started. "what? is he? jim conklin?"

the youth spoke slowly. "yes. he's dead. shot in th' side."

"yeh don't say so. jim conklin. . .poor cuss!"

all about them were other small fires surrounded by men with their little black utensils. from one of these near came sudden sharp voices in a row. it appeared that two light-footed soldiers had been teasing a huge, bearded man, causing him to spill coffee upon his blue knees. the man had gone into a rage and had sworn comprehens
