ittle green friends on tralfamadore.
 'don't lie to me, father,' said barbara. 'i know perfectly well you heard me when i
called.' this was a fairly pretty girl, except that she had legs like an edwardian grand
piano. now she raised hell with him about the letter in the paper. she said he was making
a laughing stock of himself and everybody associated with him.
 'father, father, father,' said barbara, 'what are we going to do with you? are you
going to force us to put you where your mother is?' billy's mother was still alive. she was
in bed in an old people's home called pine knoll on the edge of ilium.
 'what is it about my letter that makes you so mad?' billy wanted to know.
 'it's all just crazy. none of it's true! '
 'it's all true. ' bill's anger was not going to rise with hers. he never got mad at
anything. he was wonderful that way.
 'there is no such planet as tralfamadore.'
'it can't be detected from earth, if that's what you mean,' said billy. 'earth can't be
detected from tralfamadore, as

that, the saucer entered a time warp, and billy was flung back into his
childhood. he was twelve years old, quaking as he stood with his mother and father on
bright angel point, at the rim of grand canyon. the little human family was staring at
the floor of the canyon, one mile straight down.
 'well,' said billy's father, manfully kicking a pebble into space, 'there it is.' they had
come to this famous place by automobile. they had had several blowouts on the way.
 'it was worth the trip,' said billy's mother raptly. 'oh, god was it ever worth it.'
 billy hated the canyon. he was sure that he was going to fall in. his mother touched
him, and he wet his pants.
 there were other tourists looking down into the canyon, too, and a ranger was there to
answer questions. a frenchman who had come all the way from france asked the ranger
in broken english if many people committed suicide by jumping in.
 'yes, sir,' said the ranger. 'about three folks a year.' so it goes.
 and billy took a very short trip thro

 she upset billy simply by being his mother. she made him feel embarrassed and
ungrateful and weak because she had gone to so much trouble to give him life, and to
keep that life going, and billy didn't really like life at all.
 billy heard eliot rosewater come in and lie down. rosewater's bedsprings talked a lot
about that. rosewater was a big man, but not very powerful. he looked as though he
might be made out of nose putty.
 and then billy's mother came back from the ladies' room, sat down on a chair between
billy's and rosewater's bed. rosewater greeted her with melodious warmth, asked how
she was today. he seemed delighted to hear that she was fine. he was experimenting with
being ardently sympathetic with everybody he met. he thought that might make the
world a slightly more pleasant place to live in. he called billy's mother 'dear.' he was
experimenting with calling everybody 'dear.'
 'some day' she promised rosewater, 'i'm going to c

good to see you, mom. how have you been?"'
 'today could be the day.'
 'every night i pray.'
 'that's a good thing to do.'
 'people would be surprised if they knew how much in this world was due to prayers.'
 'you never said a truer word, dear.'
 'does your mother come to see you often?'
 'my mother is dead,' said rosewater. so it goes.
 'i'm sorry.'
 'at least she had a happy life as long as it lasted.'
 'that's a consolation, anyway.'
 'yes.'
 'billy's father is dead, you know, said billy's mother. so it goes.
 'a boy needs a father.'
 and on and on it went--that duet between the dumb, praying lady and the big, hollow
man so full of loving echoes.
 'he was at the top of his class when this happened,' said billy's mother.
 'maybe he was working too hard.' said rosewater. he held a book he wanted to read,
but he was much too polite to read and talk, too, easy as it was to give billy's mother
satisfactory answers. the book was maniacs in the fourth dimension, by kilgore trout.

couldn't see those causes at all, or even imagine them.
 one thing trout said that rosewater liked very much was that there really were
vampires and werewolves and goblins and angels and so on, but that they were in the
fourth dimension. so was william blake, rosewater's favorite poet, according to trout.
so were heaven and hell.
 'he's engaged to a very rich girl,' said billy's mother.
 'thatâ€™s good,' said rosewater. 'money can be a great comfort sometimes.'
 'it really can.'
 'of course it can.'
 'it isn't much fun if you have to pinch every penny till it screams.
 'it's nice to have a little breathing room.'
 'her father owns the optometry school where billy was going. he also owns six offices
around our part of the state. he flies his own plane and has a summer place up on lake
george.'
 'that's a beautiful lake.'
