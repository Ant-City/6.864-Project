The Ghost - 
                	The
specter of Hamlet's recently deceased father. The ghost, who claims
to have been murdered by Claudius, calls upon Hamlet to avenge him.
However, it is not entirely certain whether the ghost is what it
appears to be, or whether it is something else. Hamlet speculates that
the ghost might be a devil sent to deceive him and tempt him into
murder, and the question of what the ghost is or where it comes
from is never definitively resolved.
