almost look like a human being now!â€ says flavius, and they 
all laugh. 
i force my lips up into a smile to show how grateful i am. 
â€œthank you,â€ i say sweetly. â€œwe donâ€™t have much cause to look 
nice in district twelve.â€ 
this wins them over completely. â€œof course, you donâ€™t, you 
poor darling!â€ says octavia clasping her hands together in dis-
tress for me. 
â€œbut donâ€™t worry,â€ says venia. â€œby the time cinna is through 
with you, youâ€™re going to be absolutely gorgeous!â€

the hair and filth, youâ€™re not horrible at all!â€ says flavius en-
couragingly. â€œletâ€™s call cinna!â€ 
they dart out of the room. itâ€™s hard to hate my prep team. 
theyâ€™re such total idiots. and yet, in an odd way, i know 
theyâ€™re sincerely trying to help me. 
i look at the cold white walls and floor and resist the im-
pulse to retrieve my robe.

 but this cinna, my stylist, will sure-

hairdo, the one area of my body my prep team had been told 
to leave alone. my fingers stroke the silky braids my mother 
so carefully arranged. my mother. i left her blue dress and 
shoes on the floor of my train car, never thinking about re-
trieving them, of trying to hold on to a piece of her, of home. 
now i wish i had.

ters. iâ€™m taken aback by how normal he looks. most of the styl-
ists they interview on television are so dyed, stenciled, and 
surgically  altered  theyâ€™re  grotesque.  but  cinnaâ€™s  close-
cropped hair appears to be its natural shade of brown. heâ€™s in 
a simple black shirt and pants. the only concession to self-
alteration seems to be metallic gold eyeliner that has been ap-
plied with a light hand. it brings out the flecks of gold in his 
green eyes. and, despite my disgust with t

voice somewhat lacking in the capitolâ€™s affectations. 
â€œhello,â€ i venture cautiously.

â€œjust give me a moment, all right?â€ he asks. he walks 
around my naked body, not touching me, but taking in every 
inch of it with his eyes. i resist the impulse to cross my arms 
over my chest. â€œwho did your hair?â€ 
â€œmy mother,â€ i say. 
â€œitâ€™s beautiful. classic really. and in almost perfect balance 
with your profile. she has very clever f

ingers,â€ he says. 
i had expected someone flamboyant, someone older trying 
desperately to look young, someone who viewed me as a piece 
of meat to be prepared for a platter. cinna has met none of 
these expectations. 
â€œyouâ€™re new, arenâ€™t you? i donâ€™t think iâ€™ve seen you before,â€ 
i say. most of the stylists are familiar, constants in the ever-
changing pool of tributes. some have been around my whole 
life. â€œyes, this is my first year in the games,â€ says cinna. 
â€œso they gave you district twelve,â€ i say. newcomers gen-
erally end up with us, the least desirable district. 
â€œi asked for district twelve,â€ he says without further ex-
planation. â€œwhy donâ€™t you put on your robe and weâ€™ll have a 
chat.â€ pulling on my robe, i follow him through a door into a sit-
ting room. two red couches face off over a low table. three 
walls are blank, the fourth is entirely glass, providing a win-
dow to the city. i can see by the light that it must be a

or this one meal and even then 
it would be a poor substitution for the capitol version. 
what must it be like, i wonder, to live in a world where 
food appears at the press of a button? how would i spend the 
hours i now commit to combing the woods for sustenance if it 
were so easy to come by? what do they do all day, these 
people in the capitol, besides decorating their bodies and 
waiting around for a new shipment of tributes to roll in and 
die for their entertainment? 
i look up and find cinnaâ€™s eyes trained on mine. â€œhow des-
picable we must seem to you,â€ he says. 
has he seen this in my face or somehow read my thoughts? 
heâ€™s right, though. the whole rotten lot of them is despicable.

â€œno matter,â€ says cinna. â€œso, katniss, about your costume 
for the opening ceremonies. my partner, portia, is the stylist 
for your fellow tribute, peeta. and our current thought is to 
dress you in complementary costumes,â€ says cinna. â€œas you 
know, itâ€™s customary to re

our tributes were stark naked and covered in black powder to 
represent coal dust. itâ€™s always dreadful and does nothing to 
win favor with the crowd. i prepare myself for the worst. 
â€œso, iâ€™ll be in a coal miner outfit?â€ i ask, hoping it wonâ€™t be 
indecent. 
â€œnot exactly. you see, portia and i think that coal miner 
thingâ€™s very overdone. no one will remember you in that. and 
we both see it as our job to make the district twelve tributes 
unforgettable,â€ says cinna. 
iâ€™ll be naked for sure, i think. 
â€œso rather than focus on the coal mining itself, weâ€™re going 
to focus on the coal,â€ says cinna.  naked  and  covered  in  black 
dust, i think. â€œand what do we do with coal? we burn it,â€ says 
cinna. 
â€œyouâ€™re not afraid of fire, are you, katniss?â€ he sees my ex-
pression and grins.

a few hours later, i am dressed in what will either be the 
most sensational or the deadliest costume in the opening ce-
remonies. iâ€™m in a simple

black unitard that covers me from 
ankle to neck. shiny leather boots lace up to my knees. but itâ€™s 
the fluttering cape made of streams of orange, yellow, and red 
and the matching headpiece that define this costume. cinna 
plans to light them on fire just before our chariot rolls into the 
streets. 
â€œitâ€™s not real flame, of course, just a little synthetic fire por-
tia and i came up with. youâ€™ll be perfectly safe,â€ he says. but 
iâ€™m not convinced i wonâ€™t be perfectly barbecued by the time 
we reach the cityâ€™s center. 
my face is relatively clear of makeup, just a bit of highlight-
ing here and there. my hair has been brushed out and then

mily. â€œkatniss, the girl who was on fire.â€ 
it crosses my mind that cinnaâ€™s calm and normal demeanor 
masks a complete madman. 
despite this morningâ€™s revelation about peetaâ€™s character, 
iâ€™m actually relieved when he shows up, dressed in an identic-
al costume. he should know about fire, being a bakerâ€™s son 
and all. his stylist, portia, and her team accompany him in, 
and everyone is absolutely giddy with excitement over what a 
splash weâ€™ll make. except cinna. he just seems a bit weary as 
he accepts congratulations.

remonies are about to start. pairs of tributes are being loaded 
into chariots pulled by teams of four horses. ours are coal 
black. the animals are so well trained, no one even needs to 
guide their reins. cinna and portia direct us into the chariot 
and carefully arrange our body positions, the drape of our 
capes, before moving off to consult with each other. 
â€œwhat do you think?â€ i whisper to peeta. â€œabout the fire?â€ 
â€œiâ€™ll rip off your cape if youâ€™ll rip off mine,â€ he says through 
gritted teeth. 
â€œdeal,â€ i say. maybe, if we can get them off soon enough, 
weâ€™ll avoid the worst burns. itâ€™s bad though. theyâ€™ll throw us 
into the arena no matter what condition weâ€™re in. â€œ

district 2 gets into position to follow them. in no time at all, 
we are approaching the door and i can see that between the 
overcast sky and evening hour the light is turning gray. the 
tributes from district 11 are just rolling out when cinna ap-
pears with a lighted torch. â€œhere we go then,â€ he says, and be-
fore we can react he sets our capes on fire. i gasp, waiting for 
the heat, but there is only a faint tickling sensation. cinna

sign of relief. â€œit works.â€ then he gently tucks a hand under

â€œi think he said for us to hold hands,â€ says peeta. he grabs 
my right hand in his left, and we look to cinna for confirma-

glad now i have peeta to clutch for balance, he is so steady, 
solid as a rock. as i gain confidence, i actually blow a few 
kisses to the crowd. the people of the capitol are going nuts, 
showering us with flowers, shouting our names, our first 
names, which they have bothered to find on the program. 
the pounding music, the cheers, the admiration work their 
way into my blood,

surely, there must be one sponsor willing to take me on! and

itâ€™s not until we enter the city circle that i realize i must 
have completely stopped the circulation in peetaâ€™s hand. 
thatâ€™s how tightly iâ€™ve been holding it. i look down at our 
linked fingers as i loosen my grasp, but he regains his grip on 
me. â€œno, donâ€™t let go of me,â€ he says. the firelight flickers off 
his blue eyes. â€œplease. i might fall out of this thing.â€ 
â€œokay,â€ i say. so i keep holding on, but i canâ€™t help feeling 
strange about the way cinna has linked us together. itâ€™s not 
really fair to present us as a team and then lock us into the 
arena to kill each other. 
the twelve chariots fill the loop of the city circle. on the 
buildings that surround the circle, every window is packed 
with the most prestigious citizens of the capitol. our horses 
pull our chariot right up to president snowâ€™s mansion, and we 
come to a halt. the music ends with a flourish.

the doors have only just shut behind us when weâ€™re en-
gulfed by the prep teams, who are nearly unintelligible as they 
babble out praise. as i glance around, i notice a lot of the other 
tributes are shooting us dirty looks, which confirms what iâ€™ve 
suspected, weâ€™ve literally outshone them all. then cinna and 
portia are there, helping us down from the chariot, carefully 
removing our flaming capes and headdresses. portia extin-
guishes them with some kind of spray from a canister. 
i realize iâ€™m still glued to peeta and force my stiff fingers to 
open. we both massage our hands. 
â€œthanks for keeping hold of me. i was getting a little shaky

overlooks the capitol when we enter the dining room. iâ€™m glad

to see the stylists, particularly after i hear that haymitch will 
be joining us. a meal presided over by just 
effie and haymitch is bound to be a disaster. besides, din-

gies, and cinna and portia have already proven how valuable 
they are.

haymitch shows up just as dinner is being served. it looks 
as if heâ€™s had his own stylist because heâ€™s clean and groomed 
and about as sober as iâ€™ve ever seen him. he doesnâ€™t refuse the 
offer of wine, but when he starts in on his soup, i realize itâ€™s 
the first time iâ€™ve ever seen him eat. maybe he really will pull 
himself together long enough to help us. 
cinna and portia seem to have a civilizing effect on hay-
mitch and effie. at least theyâ€™re addressing each other decent-
ly. and they both have nothing but praise for our stylistsâ€™ 
opening act. while they make small talk, i concentrate on the 
meal. mushroom soup, bitter greens with tomatoes the size of 
peas, rare roast beef sliced as thin as paper, noodles in a green 
sauce, cheese that melts on your tongue served with sweet 
blue grapes. the servers, all young people dressed in white

a butterfly. she may also be the friendliest person on the pla-

have never seen the girl with the red hair smile. but i jump on 
peetaâ€™s suggestion gratefully. â€œof course, thatâ€™s who i was 
thinking of. it must be the hair,â€ i say. 
â€œsomething about the eyes, too,â€ says peeta. 
the energy at the table relaxes. â€œoh, well. if thatâ€™s all it is,â€ 
says cinna. â€œand yes, the cake has spirits, but all the alcohol 
has burned off. i ordered it specially in honor of your fiery de-
but.â€ we eat the cake and move into a sitting room to watch the 
replay of the opening ceremonies thatâ€™s being broadcast. a 
few of the other couples make a nice impression, but none of 
them can hold a candle to us. even our own party lets out an

when i remember the other couples, standing stiffly apart, 
never touching or acknowledging each other, as if their fellow 
tribute did not exist, as if the games had already begun, i 
know what haymitch means. presenting ourselves not as ad-
versaries but as friends has distinguished us as much as the 
fiery costumes.

while the crowds urge on my killer. 
to tell or not to tell? my brain still feels slow from the wine. 
i stare down the empty corridor as if the decision lies there. 
peeta picks up on my hesitation. â€œhave you been on the 
roof yet?â€ i shake my head. â€œcinna showed me. you can practi-
cally see the whole city. the windâ€™s a bit loud, though.â€ 
i translate this into â€œno one will overhear us talkingâ€ in my 
head. you do have the sense that we might be under surveil-
lance here. â€œcan we just go up?â€ 
â€œsure, come on,â€ says peeta. i follow him to a flight of stairs 
that lead to the roof. thereâ€™s a small dome-shaped room with 
a door to the outside. as we step into the cool, windy evening 
air, i catch my breath at the view. the capitol

peeta and i walk to a railing at the edge of the roof. i look 
straight down the side of the building to the street, which is 
buzzing with people. you can hear their cars, an occasional 
shout, and a strange metallic tinkling. in district 12, weâ€™d all 
be thinking about bed right now. 
â€œi asked cinna why they let us up here. werenâ€™t they wor-
ried that some of the tributes might decide to jump right over 
the side?â€ says peeta. 
â€œwhatâ€™d he say?â€ i ask. 
â€œyou canâ€™t,â€ says peeta. he holds out his hand into seeming-
ly empty space. thereâ€™s a sharp zap and he jerks it back. 
â€œsome kind of electric field throws you back on the roof.â€

can that be right? yes, just two. and now how empty the 
house feels, even from a distance. what did they say last night 
about my fiery debut at the games? did it give them hope, or 
simply add to their terror when they saw the reality of twen-
ty-four tributes circled together, knowing only one could live? 
haymitch and peeta come in, bid me good morning, fill 
their plates. it makes me irritated that peeta is wearing exact-
ly the same outfit i am. i need to say something to cinna. this 
twins act is going to blow up in out faces once the games be-
gin. surely, they must know this. then i remember haymitch

telling me to do exactly what the stylists tell me to do. if it was 
anyone but cinna, i might be tempted to ignore him. but after 
last nightâ€™s triumph, i donâ€™t have a lot of room to criticize his 
choices.

which all the tributes practice together. on the last afternoon,

clever with plants, climbs swiftly, and has good aim. she can 
hit the target every time with a slingshot. but what is a sling-
shot against a 220-pound male with a sword? 
back on the district 12 floor, haymitch and effie grill us 
throughout breakfast and dinner about every moment of the 
day. what we did, who watched us, how the other tributes size 
up. cinna and portia arenâ€™t around, so thereâ€™s no one to add 
any sanity to the meals. not that haymitch and effie are fight-
ing anymore. instead they seem to be of one mind, determined 
to whip us into shape. full of endless directions about what 
we should do and not do in training. peeta is more patient, but 
i become fed up and surly. 
when we finally escape to bed on the second night, peeta 
mumbles, â€œsomeone ought to get haymitch a drink.â€

when effie taps on the door to call me to dinner, i decide i 
may as well go. the scores will be televised tonight. itâ€™s not 
like i can hide what happened forever. i go to the bathroom 
and wash my face, but itâ€™s still red and splotchy. 
everyoneâ€™s waiting at the table, even cinna and portia. i 
wish the stylists hadnâ€™t shown up because for some reason, i 
donâ€™t like the idea of disappointing them. itâ€™s as if iâ€™ve thrown 
away all the good work they did on the opening ceremonies 
without a thought. i avoid looking at anyone as i take tiny 
spoonfuls of fish soup. the saltiness reminds me of my tears.

doesnâ€™t seem real. 
â€œthere must be a mistake. how . . . how could that happen?â€

thinking the content session should be an improvement over 
the morning. i couldnâ€™t be more wrong. after lunch, haymitch 
takes me into the sitting room, directs me to the couch, and 
then just frowns at me for a while. 
â€œwhat?â€ i finally ask. 
â€œiâ€™m trying to figure out what to do with you,â€ he says. 
â€œhow weâ€™re going to present you. are you going to be charm-
ing? aloof? fierce? so far, youâ€™re shining like a star. you volun-
teered to save your sister. cinna made you look unforgettable. 
youâ€™ve got the top training score. people are intrigued, but no 
one knows who you are. the impression you make tomorrow 
will decide exactly what i can get you in terms of sponsors,â€ 
says haymitch. 
having watched the tribute interviews all my life, i know 
thereâ€™s truth to what heâ€™s saying. if you appeal to the crowd, 
either by being humorous or brutal or eccentric, you gain fa-

humble.â€ 
â€œhumble,â€ i echo. 
â€œthat you canâ€™t believe a little girl from district twelve has 
done this well. the whole thingâ€™s been more than you ever 
could have dreamed of. talk about cinnaâ€™s clothes. how nice 
the people are. how the city amazes you. if you wonâ€™t talk 
about yourself, at least compliment the audience. just keep 
turning it back around, all right. gush.â€ 
the next hours are agonizing. at once, itâ€™s clear i cannot 
gush. we try me playing cocky, but i just donâ€™t have the arrog-
ance. apparently, iâ€™m too â€œvulnerableâ€ for ferocity. iâ€™m not wit-
ty. funny. sexy. or mysterious. 
by the end of the session, i am no one at all. haymitch 
started drinking

in between the sheets like a five-year-old and let her tuck me

there when i wake up. i want the protection of this girl, even

in the morning, itâ€™s not the girl but my prep team who are 
hanging over me. my lessons with effie and haymitch are 
over. this day belongs to cinna. heâ€™s my last hope. maybe he 
can make me look so wonderful, no one will care what comes 
out of my mouth. 
the team works on me until late afternoon, turning my skin 
to glowing satin, stenciling patterns on my arms, painting 
flame designs on my twenty perfect nails. then venia goes to 
work on my hair, weaving strands of red into a pattern that 
begins at my left ear, wraps around my head, and then falls in 
one braid down my right shoulder. they erase my face with a 
layer of pale makeup

and draw my features back out. huge 
dark eyes, full red lips, lashes that throw off bits of light when 
i blink. finally, they cover my entire body in a powder that 
makes me shimmer in gold dust. 
then cinna enters with what i assume is my dress, but i 
canâ€™t really see it because itâ€™s covered. â€œclose your eyes,â€ he 
orders. 
i can feel the silken inside as they slip it down over my 
naked body, then the weight. it must be forty pounds. i clutch 
octaviaâ€™s hand as i blindly step into my shoes, glad to find 
they are at least two inches lower than the pair effie had me 
practice in. thereâ€™s some adjusting and fidgeting. then si-

â€œcan i open my eyes?â€ i ask.

flash and apparently they make their clothes from jewels. be-
cause my dress, oh, my dress is entirely covered in reflective 
precious gems, red and yellow and white with bits of blue that 
accent the tips of the flame design. the slightest movement 
gives the impression i am engulfed in tongues of fire. 
i am not pretty. i am not beautiful. i am as radiant as the 
sun. for a while, we all just stare at me. â€œoh, cinna,â€ i finally 
whisper. â€œthank you.â€ 
â€œtwirl for me,â€ he says. i hold out my arms and spin in a 
circle. the prep team screams in admiration. 
cinna dismisses the team and has me move around in the 
dress and shoes, which are infinitely more manageable than 
effieâ€™s. the dress hangs in such a way that i donâ€™t have to lift 
the skirt when i walk, leaving me with one less thing to worry 
about. 
â€œso, all ready for the interview then?â€ asks cinna. i can see 
by his expression that

knows how dreadful i am. 
â€œiâ€™m awful. haymitch called me a dead slug. no matter what 
we tried, i couldnâ€™t do it. i just canâ€™t be one of those people he 
wants me to be,â€ i say. 
cinna thinks about this a moment. â€œwhy donâ€™t you just be 
yourself?â€ 
â€œmyself? thatâ€™s no good, either. haymitch says iâ€™m sullen 
and hostile,â€ i say. 
â€œwell, you are . . . around haymitch,â€ says cinna with a grin. 
â€œi donâ€™t find you so. the prep team adores you. you even won

cinna takes my icy hands in his warm ones. â€œsuppose, when 
you answer the questions, you think youâ€™re addressing a 
friend back home. who would your best friend be?â€ asks cin-
na. â€œgale,â€ i say instantly. â€œonly it doesnâ€™t make sense, cinna. i 
would never be telling gale those things about me. he already 
knows them.â€ 
â€œwhat about me? could you think of me as a friend?â€ asks 
cinna. of all the people iâ€™ve met since i left home, cinna is by far 
my favorite. i liked him right off and he hasnâ€™t disappointed 
me yet. â€œi think so, but â€”â€ 
â€œiâ€™ll be sitting on the main platform with the other stylists. 
youâ€™ll be able to look right at me. when youâ€™re asked a ques-
tion, find me, and answer it as honestly as possible,â€ says cin-
na. â€œeven if what i think is horrible?â€ i ask. because it might be, 
really. 
â€œespecially if what you think is horrible,â€ says cinna. â€œyouâ€™ll 
try it?â€

 itâ€™s a plan. or at least a straw to grasp at. 
too soon itâ€™s time to go. the interviews take place on a 
stage constructed in front of the training center. once i leave 
my room, it will be only minutes until iâ€™m in front of the 
crowd, the cameras, all of panem. 
as cinna turns the doorknob, i stop his hand. â€œcinna . . .â€ iâ€™m 
completely overcome with stage fright. 
â€œremember, they already love you,â€ he says gently. â€œjust be 
yourself.â€ 
we meet up with the rest of the district 12 crowd at the 
elevator. portia and her gang have been hard at work. peeta 
looks striking in a black suit with flame accents. while we look 
well together, itâ€™s a relief not to be dressed identically. hay-

haymitch, but accept effieâ€™s compliments. effi

reacts.

not to immediately wipe his off on his suit. 
â€œso, katniss, the capitol must be quite a change from dis-

here?â€ asks caesar. 
what? what did he say? itâ€™s as if the words make no sense. 
my mouth has gone as dry as sawdust. i desperately find 
cinna in the crowd and lock eyes with him. i imagine the 
words coming from his lips. â€œwhatâ€™s impressed you most since 
you arrived here?â€ i rack my brain for something that made 
me happy here. be honest, i think. be honest. 
â€œthe lamb stew,â€ i get out. 
caesar laughs, and vaguely i realize some of the audience 
has joined in.

â€œletâ€™s go back then, to the moment they called your sisterâ€™s

â€œand you volunteered. can you tell us about her?â€ 
no. no, not all of you. but maybe cinna. i donâ€™t think iâ€™m 
imagining the sadness on his face. â€œher nameâ€™s prim. sheâ€™s just 
twelve. and i love her more than anything.â€ 
you could hear a pin drop in the city circle now. 
â€œwhat did she say to you? after the reaping?â€ caesar asks.

his car when i slam my palms into his chest. he loses his bal-
ance and crashes into an ugly urn filled with fake flowers. the 
urn tips and shatters into hundreds of tiny pieces. peeta lands 
in the shards, and blood immediately flows from his hands. 
â€œwhat was that for?â€ he says, aghast. 
â€œyou had no right! no right to go saying those things about 
me!â€ i shout at him. 
now the elevators open and the whole crew is there, effie, 
haymitch, cinna, and portia. 
â€œwhatâ€™s going on?â€ says effie, a note of hysteria in her 
voice. â€œdid you fall?â€

him up. haymitch turns on me. â€œshoved him?â€

boys back home fall longingly at your feet. which do you think 
will get you more sponsors?â€ 
the smell of wine on his breath makes me sick. i shove his 
hands off my shoulders and step away, trying to clear my 
head. cinna comes over and puts his arm around me. â€œheâ€™s right, 
katniss.â€

hands are wrapped in bandages. i canâ€™t help feeling guilty. 
tomorrow we will be in the arena. he has done me a favor 
and i have answered with an injury. will i never stop owing 
him? after dinner, we watch the replay in the sitting room. i 
seem frilly and shallow, twirling and giggling in my dress, al-
though the others assure me i am charming. peeta actually is 
charming and then utterly winning as the boy in love. and 
there i am, blushing and confused, made beautiful by cinnaâ€™s 
hands, desirable by peetaâ€™s confession, tragic by circumstance, 
and by all accounts, unforgettable.

i know haymitch and effie will not be going with us. as 
soon as they leave here, theyâ€™ll be at the games headquarters, 
hopefully madly signing up our sponsors, working out a strat-
egy on how and when to deliver the gifts to us. cinna and por-
tia will travel with us to the very spot from which we will be 
launched into the arena. still final good-byes must be said 
here. effie takes both of us by the hand and, with actual tears in 
her eyes, wishes us well. thanks us for being the best tributes 
it has ever been her privilege to sponsor. and then, because 
itâ€™s effie and sheâ€™s apparently required by law to say some-
thing awful, she adds â€œi wouldnâ€™t be at all surprised if i finally

ago from district 6 called titus. he went 
completely savage and the gamemakers had to have him 
stunned with electric guns to collect the bodies of the players 
he'd killed before he ate them. there are no rules in the arena, 
but cannibalism doesn't play well with the capitol audience, 
so they tried to head it off. there was some speculation that 
the avalanche that finally took titus out was specifically engi-
neered to ensure the victor was not a lunatic. 
i don't see peeta in the morning. cinna comes to me before 
dawn, gives me a simple shift to wear, and guides me to the 
roof. my final dressing and preparations will be alone in the 
catacombs under the arena itself. a hovercraft appears out of 
thin air, just like the one did in the woods the day i saw the 
redheaded avox girl captured, and a ladder drops down. i 
place my hands and feet on the lower rungs and instantly it's 
as if i'm frozen. some sort of current glues me to the ladder 
while i'm lifted safely inside.

leads down into a tube underground, into the catacombs that 
lie beneath the arena. we follow instructions to my destina-
tion, a chamber for my preparation. in the capitol, they call it 
the launch room. in the districts, itâ€™s referred to as the stock-
yard. the place animals go before slaughter.

i struggle to keep my breakfast down as i shower and clean 
my teeth. cinna does my hair in my simple trademark braid 
down my back. then the clothes arrive, the same for every 
tribute. cinna has had no say in my outfit, does not even know 
what will be in the package, but he helps me dress in the un-

effieâ€™s somewhat teary and keeps patting my hair and talking 
about how she told everyone we were pearls. cinna just hugs 
me tight and doe

snâ€™t say anything. then i notice portia is ab-
sent and get a bad feeling. 
â€œwhereâ€™s portia? is she with peeta? he is all right, isnâ€™t he? i 
mean, heâ€™s alive?â€ i blurt out. 
â€œheâ€™s fine. only they want to do your reunion live on air at 
the ceremony,â€ says haymitch. 
â€œoh. thatâ€™s all,â€ i say. the awful moment of thinking peetaâ€™s 
dead again passes. â€œi guess iâ€™d want to see that myself.â€ 
â€œgo on with cinna. he has to get you ready,â€ says haymitch. 
itâ€™s a relief to be alone with cinna, to feel his protective arm 
around my shoulders as he guides me away from the cameras, 
down a few passages and to an elevator that leads to the lobby 
of the training center. the hospital then is far underground, 
even beneath the gym where the tributes practiced tying 
knots and throwing spears. the windows of the lobby are 
darkened, and a handful of guards stand on duty. no one else 
is there to see us cros

 elevator. our footsteps 
echo in the emptiness. and when we ride up to the twelfth 
floor, the faces of all the tributes who will never return flash 
across my mind and thereâ€™s a heavy, tight place in my chest. 
when the elevator doors open, venia, flavius, and octavia 
engulf me, talking so quickly and ecstatically i canâ€™t make out 
their words. the sentiment is clear though. they are truly 
thrilled to see me and iâ€™m happy to see them, too, although not

like i was to see cinna. itâ€™s more in the way one might be glad 
to see an affectionate trio of pets at the end of a particularly 
difficult day. 
they sweep me into the dining room and i get a real meal 
â€” roast beef and peas and soft rolls â€” although my portions 
are still being strictly controlled. because when i ask for 
seconds, iâ€™m refused. 
â€œno, no, no. they donâ€™t want it all coming back up on the 
stage,â€ says octavia, but she secretly slips me an extra roll un-
der the table to let me know sheâ€

™s on my side. 
we go back to my room and cinna disappears for a while as 
the prep team gets me ready. 
â€œoh, they did a full body polish on you,â€ says flavius en-
viously. â€œnot a flaw left on your skin.â€ 
but when i look at my naked body in the mirror, all i can 
see is how skinny i am. i mean, iâ€™m sure i was worse when i 
came out of the arena, but i can easily count my ribs. 
they take care of the shower settings for me, and they go to 
work on my hair, nails, and makeup when iâ€™m done. they 
chatter so continuously that i bare

get back to business as soon as possible when theyâ€™re over. to 
keep from hating the prep team, i effectively tune out most of 
what theyâ€™re saying. 
cinna comes in with what appears to be an unassuming yel-
low dress across his arms. 
â€œhave you given up the whole â€˜girl on fireâ€™ thing?â€ i ask. 
â€œyou tell me,â€ he says, and slips it over my head. i imme-
diately notice the padding over my breasts, adding curves that 
hunger has stolen from my body. my hands go to my chest and 
i frown. 
â€œi know,â€ says cinna before i can object. â€œbut the game-
makers wanted to alter you surgically. haymitch had a huge 
fight with them over it. this

was the compromise.â€ he stops 
me before i can look at my reflection. â€œwait, donâ€™t forget the 
shoes.â€ venia helps me into a pair of flat leather sandals and i 
turn to the mirror. 
i am still the â€œgirl on fire.â€ the sheer fabric softly glows. 
even the slight movement in the air sends a ripple up my 
body. by comparison, the chariot costume seems garish, the 
interview dress too contrived. in this dress, i give the illusion 
of wearing candlelight. 
â€œwhat do you think?â€ asks cinna. 
â€œi think itâ€™s the best yet,â€ i say. when i manage to pull my 
eyes away from the flickering fabric, iâ€™m in for something of a 
shock. my hairâ€™s loose, held back by a simple hairband. the 
makeup rounds and fills out the sharp angles of my face. a 
clear polish coats my nails. the sleeveless dress is gathered at 
my ribs, not my waist, largely eliminating any help the pad-

ue stature. i look, very 
simply, like a girl. a young one. fourteen at the most. inno-
cent. harmless. yes, it is shocking that cinna has pulled this off 
when you remember iâ€™ve just won the games. 
this is a very calculated look. nothing cinna designs is ar-
bitrary. i bite my lip trying to figure out his motivation. 
â€œi thought itâ€™d be something more . . . sophisticated-
looking,â€ i say. 
â€œi thought peeta would like this better,â€ he answers careful-
ly. peeta? no, itâ€™s not about peeta. itâ€™s about the capitol and 
the gamemakers and the audience. although i do not yet un-
derstand cinnaâ€™s design, itâ€™s a reminder the games are not 
quite finished. and beneath his benign reply, i sense a warn-
ing. of something he can

e trained. itâ€™s cus-
tomary for the victor and his or her support team to rise from 
beneath the stage. first the prep team, followed by the escort, 
the stylist, the mentor, and finally the victor. only this year, 
with two victors who share both an escort and a mentor, the 
whole thing has had to be rethought. i find myself in a poorly 
lit area under the stage. a brand-new metal plate has been in-
stalled to transport me upward. you can still see small piles of 
sawdust, smell fresh paint. cinna and the prep team peel off to 
change into their own costumes and take their positions, leav-

ing me alone. in the gloom, i see a makeshift wall about ten 
yards away and assume peetaâ€™s behind it. 
the rumbling of the crowd is loud, so i donâ€™t notice hay-
mitch until he touches my shoulder. i spring away, startled, 
still half in the arena, i guess. 
â€œeasy, just me. letâ€™s have a look at you,â€ haymitch says. i 
hold out my arms and turn once. â€œgood enough.â€ 
itâ€™s no

nothing is covering my mouth. â€œso, what?â€ 
â€œyour only defense can be you were so madly in love you 
werenâ€™t responsible for your actions.â€ haymitch pulls back 
and adjusts my hairband. â€œgot it, sweetheart?â€ he could be 
talking about anything now. 
â€œgot it,â€ i say. â€œdid you tell peeta this?â€

â€œdonâ€™t have to,â€ says haymitch. â€œheâ€™s already there.â€ 
â€œbut you think iâ€™m not?â€ i say, taking the opportunity to 
straighten a bright red bow tie cinna must have wrestled him 
into. â€œsince when does it matter what i think?â€ says haymitch. 
â€œbetter take our places.â€ he leads me to the metal circle. â€œthis 
is your night, sweetheart. enjoy it.â€ he kisses me on the fore-
head and disappears into the gloom. 
i tug on my skirt, willing it to be longer, wanting it to cover 
the knocking in my knees. then i realize itâ€™s pointless. my 
whole bodyâ€™s shaking like a leaf. hopefully, it will be put down 
to excitement. after all, itâ€™s my

ight from now on? he must. he will 
want to help us. the crowd breaks into applause as the prep 
teams are presented. i imagine flavius, venia, and octavia 
bouncing around and taking ridiculous, bobbing bows. itâ€™s a 
safe bet theyâ€™re clueless. then effieâ€™s introduced. how long 
sheâ€™s waited for this moment. i hope sheâ€™s able to enjoy it be-
cause as misguided as effie can be, she has a very keen in-
stinct about certain things and must at least suspect weâ€™re in 
trouble. portia and cinna receive huge cheers, of course, 
theyâ€™ve been brilliant, had a dazzling debut. i now understand 
cinnaâ€™s choice of dress for me for tonight. iâ€™ll need to look as 
girlish and innocent as possible. haymitchâ€™s appearance 
brings a round of stomping that goes on at least five minutes. 
well, heâ€™s accomplished a first. keeping not only one but two 
tributes alive. what if he hadnâ€™t warned me in time? would i 
have acted differently? flaunted the moment with the berries 
in the capitolâ€

, but one look from 
haymitch tells me it isnâ€™t enough. kicking off my sandals, i 
tuck my feet to the side and lean my head against peetaâ€™s 
shoulder. his arm goes around me automatically, and i feel 
like iâ€™m back in the cave, curled up against him, trying to keep 
warm. his shirt is made of the same yellow material as my 
dress, but portiaâ€™s put him in long black pants. no sandals, ei-

ther, but a pair of sturdy black boots he keeps solidly planted 
on the stage. i wish cinna had given me a similar outfit, i feel 
so vulnerable in this flimsy dress. but i guess that was the 
point. caesar flickerman makes a few more jokes, and then itâ€™s 
time for the show. this will last exactly three hours and is re-
quired viewing for all of panem. as the lights dim and the seal 
appears on the screen, i realize iâ€™m unprepared for this. i do 
not want to watch my twenty-two fellow tributes die. i saw 
enough of them die the first time. my heart starts pounding

get back in bed and pretend to sleep until effie trinket comes 
to alert me to the start of another â€œbig, big, big day!â€ 
i have about five minutes to eat a bowl of hot grain and 
stew before the prep team descends. all i have to say is, â€œthe 
crowd loved you!â€ and itâ€™s unnecessary to speak for the next 
couple of hours. when cinna comes in, he shoos them out and 
dresses me in a white, gauzy dress and pink shoes. then he 
personally adjusts my makeup until i seem to radiate a soft, 
rosy glow. we make idle chitchat, but iâ€™m afraid to ask him 
anything of real importance because after the incident with 
the door, i canâ€™t shake the feeling that iâ€™m being watched con-
stantly. 
the interview takes place right down the hall in the sitting 
room. a space has been cleared and the love seat has been 
moved in and surround

s. 
caesar signs off and itâ€™s over. everyoneâ€™s laughing and cry-
ing and hugging, but iâ€™m still not sure until i reach haymitch. 
â€œokay?â€ i whisper. 
â€œperfect,â€ he answers. 
i go back to my room to collect a few things and find thereâ€™s 
nothing to take but the mockingjay pin madge gave me. some-
one returned it to my room after the games. they drive us 
through the streets in a car with blackened windows, and the 
trainâ€™s waiting for us. we barely have time to say good-bye to 
cinna and portia, although weâ€™ll see them in a few months, 
when we tour the districts for a round of victory ceremonies. 
itâ€™s the capitolâ€™s way of reminding people that the hunger 
games never really go away. weâ€™ll be given a lot of useless 
plaques, and everyone will have to pretend they love us. 
the train begins moving and weâ€™re plunged into night until 
we clear the tunnel and i take my first free breath since the 
reaping. effie is accompanying us back and haymitch, too, of 
course.
