[CHARACTER]  - 
      andrea's ghost is the first character we see in the play, and the first voice to cry out for revenge. his quest for revenge can be seen both as a quest for justice, since it is sanctioned by persephone, the queen of the underworld, and as a quest for closure. andrea is denied closure when he travels to the underworld, because the three judges there cannot decide where to place him; ironically, at the end of the play he becomes a judge himself, determining the places of the various characters in hell.
