uld be grand, certainly,’ said alice thoughtfully: ‘but then--i
shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.’

‘not at first, perhaps,’ said the hatter: ‘but you could keep it to
half-past one as long as you liked.’

‘is that the way you manage?’ alice asked.

the hatter shook his head mournfully. ‘not i!’ he replied. ‘we
quarrelled last march--just before he went mad, you know--’ (pointing
with his tea spoon at the march hare,) ‘--it was at the great concert
given by the queen of hearts, and i had to sing

     “twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
     how i wonder what you’re at!”

you know the song, perhaps?’

‘i’ve heard something like it,’ said alice.

‘it goes on, you know,’ the hatter continued, ‘in this way:--

     “up above the world you fly,
     like a tea-tray in the sky.
         twinkle, twinkle--“’

here the dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep ‘twinkle,
twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--’ and went on so long that they had to pi

; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented
with hearts. next came the guests, mostly kings and queens, and among
them alice recognised the white rabbit: it was talking in a hurried
nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without
noticing her. then followed the knave of hearts, carrying the king’s
crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand
procession, came the king and queen of hearts.

alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard
of such a rule at processions; ‘and besides, what would be the use of
a procession,’ thought she, ‘if people had all to lie down upon their
faces, so that they couldn’t see it?’ so she stood still where she was,
and waited.

when the procession came opposite to alice, they all stopped and looked
at her, and the queen said severely ‘who is t

distance.

‘come on!’ cried the gryphon, and, taking alice by the hand, it hurried
off, without waiting for the end of the song.

‘what trial is it?’ alice panted as she ran; but the gryphon only
answered ‘come on!’ and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--

   ‘soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
     beautiful, beautiful soup!’




chapter xi. who stole the tarts?

the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they
arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little
birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the knave was
standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
him; and near the king was the white rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,
and a scroll of parchment in the other. in the very middle of the court
was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,
that it made alice quite hungry to loo

nity of taking it away. she did it so quickly
that the poor little juror (it was bill, the lizard) could not make out
at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was
obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was
of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.

‘herald, read the accusation!’ said the king.

on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--

   ‘the queen of hearts, she made some tarts,
      all on a summer day:
    the knave of hearts, he stole those tarts,
      and took them quite away!’

‘consider your verdict,’ the king said to the jury.

‘not yet, not yet!’ the rabbit hastily interrupted. ‘there’s a great
deal to come before that!’

‘call the first witness,’ said the king; and the white rabbit blew three
blasts on the trumpet, and called out, ‘first witness!’

the first witness was the hatter. he came in with a teacup in one
