khirin. [angrily] excuse me, youâ€™ve made me lose my place! you go
talking about your mamma and katya, and i understand nothing; and iâ€™ve
lost my place.

tatiana alexeyevna. what does that matter? you listen when a lady is
talking to you! why are you so angry to-day? are you in love? [laughs.]

shipuchin. [to merchutkina] excuse me, but what is this? i canâ€™t make
head or tail of it.

tatiana alexeyevna. are you in love? aha! youâ€™re blushing!

shipuchin. [to his wife] tanya, dear, do go out into the public office
for a moment. i shanâ€™t be long.

tatiana alexeyevna. all right. [goes out.]

shipuchin. i donâ€™t understand anything of this. youâ€™ve obviously come
to the wrong place, madam. your petition doesnâ€™t concern us at all. you
should go to the department in which your husband was employed.

merchutkina. iâ€™ve been there a good many times these five months, and
they wouldnâ€™t even look at my petition. iâ€™d given up all hopes, but,

act one


[a room which is still called the nursery. one of the doors leads into
anyaâ€™s room. it is close on sunrise. it is may. the cherry-trees are
in flower but it is chilly in the garden. there is an early frost.
the windows of the room are shut. dunyasha comes in with a candle, and
lopakhin with a book in his hand.]

lopakhin. the trainâ€™s arrived, thank god. whatâ€™s the time?

dunyasha. it will soon be two. [blows out candle] it is light already.

lopakhin. how much was the train late? two hours at least. [yawns and
stretches himself] i have made a rotten mess of it! i

[two carriages are heard driving up to the house. lopakhin and dunyasha
quickly go out. the stage is empty. a noise begins in the next room.
fiers, leaning on a stick, walks quickly across the stage; he has just
been to meet lubov andreyevna. he wears an old-fashioned livery and a
tall hat. he is saying something to himself, but not a word of it can be
made out. the noise behind the stage gets louder and louder. a voice is
heard: â€œletâ€™s go in there.â€ enter lubov andreyevna, anya, and charlotta
ivanovna with a little dog on a chain, and all dressed in travelling
clothes, varya in a long coat and with a kerchief on her head. gaev,
simeonov-pischin, lopakhin, dunyasha with a parcel and an umbrella, and
a servant with luggage--all cross the room.]

anya. letâ€™s come through here. do you remember what this room is,
mother?

lubov. [joyfully, through her tears] the nursery!

varya. how cold it is! my hands are quite numb. [to lubov andreyevna]

lubov. my dear nursery, oh, you beautiful room.... i used to sleep
here when i was a baby. [weeps] and here i am like a little girl again.
[kisses her brother, varya, then her brother again] and varya is just as
she used to be, just like a nun. and i knew dunyasha. [kisses her.]

gaev. the train was two hours late. there now; howâ€™s that for
punctuality?

charlotta. [to pischin] my dog eats nuts too.

pischin. [astonished] to think of that, now!

[all go out except anya and dunyasha.]

dunyasha. we did have to wait for you!

[takes off anyaâ€™s cloak and hat.]

anya. i didnâ€™t get any sleep for four nights on the journey.... iâ€™m
awfully cold.

dunyasha. you went away during lent, when it was snowing and frosty, but
now? darling! [laughs and kisses her] we did have to wait for you, my
joy, my pet.... i must tell you at once, i canâ€™t bear to wait a minute.

anya. [tired] something else now...?

dunyasha. the clerk, epikhodov, proposed to me after easter.

hairpins.... [she is very tired, and even staggers as she walks.]

dunyasha. i donâ€™t know what to think about it. he loves me, he loves me
so much!

anya. [looks into her room; in a gentle voice] my room, my windows, as
if iâ€™d never gone away. iâ€™m at home! to-morrow morning iâ€™ll get up and
have a run in the garden....oh, if i could only get to sleep! i didnâ€™t
sleep the whole journey, i was so bothered.

dunyasha. peter sergeyevitch came two days ago.

anya. [joyfully] peter!

dunyasha. he sleeps in the bath-house, he lives there. he said he was
afraid heâ€™d be in the way. [looks at her pocket-watch] i ought to wake
him, but barbara miha

varya. dunyasha, some coffee, quick. mother wants some.

dunyasha. this minute. [exit.]

varya. well, youâ€™ve come, glory be to god. home again. [caressing her]
my darling is back again! my pretty one is back again!

anya. i did have an awful time, i tell you.

varya. i can just imagine it!

anya. i went away in holy week; it was very cold then. charlotta talked
the whole way and would go on performing her tricks. why did you tie
charlotta on to me?

varya. you couldnâ€™t go alone, darling, at seventeen!

anya. we went to paris; itâ€™s cold there and snowing. i talk french
perfectly horribly. my mother lives on the fifth floor. i go to her, and
find her there with various frenchmen, women, an old abbÃ© with a book,
and everything in tobacco smoke and with no comfort at all. i suddenly

and hugged her and wouldnâ€™t let her go. then mother started hugging me
and crying....

varya. [weeping] donâ€™t say any more, donâ€™t say any more....

anya. sheâ€™s already sold her villa near mentone; sheâ€™s nothing left,
nothing. and i havenâ€™t a copeck left either; we only just managed to get
here. and mother wonâ€™t understand! we had dinner at a station; she asked
for all the expensive things, and tipped the waiters one rouble each.
and charlotta too. yasha wants his share too--itâ€™s too bad. motherâ€™s got
a footman now, yasha; weâ€™ve brought him here.

varya. i saw the wretch.

anya. howâ€™s business? has the interest been paid?

varya.

 not much chance of that.

anya. oh god, oh god...

varya. the place will be sold in august.

varya. [through her tears] iâ€™d like to.... [shakes her fist.]

anya. [embraces varya, softly] varya, has he proposed to you? [varya
shakes head] but he loves you.... why donâ€™t you make up your minds? why
do you keep on waiting?

varya. i think that it will all come to nothing. heâ€™s a busy man. iâ€™m
not his affair... he pays no attention to me. bless the man, i donâ€™t
want to see him.... but everybody talks about our marriage, everybody
congratulates me, and thereâ€™s nothing in it at all, itâ€™s all like a
dream. [in another tone] youâ€™ve got a brooch li

like a child] in paris i went up in a balloon!

varya. my darlingâ€™s come back, my pretty oneâ€™s come back! [dunyasha has
already returned with the coffee-pot and is making the coffee, varya
stands near the door] i go about all day, looking after the house, and
i think all the time, if only you could marry a rich man, then iâ€™d be
happy and would go away somewhere by myself, then to kiev... to moscow,

varya. it must be getting on for three. time you went to sleep, darling.
[goes into anyaâ€™s room] splendid!

[enter yasha with a plaid shawl and a travelling bag.]

yasha. [crossing the stage: politely] may i go this way?

dunyasha. i hardly knew you, yasha. you have changed abroad.

yasha. hm... and who are you?

dunyasha. when you went away i was only so high. [showing with her hand]
iâ€™m dunyasha, the daughter of theodore kozoyedov. you donâ€™t remember!

yasha. oh, you little cucumber!

varya. it may bring luck.

anya. [coming out of her room] we must tell mother that peterâ€™s here.

varya. i told them not to wake him.

anya. [thoughtfully] father died six years ago, and a month later my
brother grisha was drowned in the river--such a dear little boy of
seven! mother couldnâ€™t bear it; she went away, away, without looking
round.... [shudders] how i understand her; if only she knew! [pause] and
peter trofimov was grishaâ€™s tutor, he might tell her....

in, moves his arms and body about as if he is playing billiards.]

lubov. let me remember now. red into the corner! twice into the centre!

gaev. right into the pocket! once upon a time you and i used both to
sleep in this room, and now iâ€™m fifty-one; it does seem strange.

lopakhin. yes, time does go.

gaev. who does?

lopakhin. i said that time does go.

gaev. it smells of patchouli here.

anya. iâ€™m going to bed. good-night, mother. [kisses her.]

lubov. my lovely little one. [kisses her hand] glad to be at home? i
canâ€™t get over it.

anya. good-night, uncle.

gaev. [kisses her face and hands] god be with you. how you do resemble
your mother! [to his sister] you were just like her at her age, luba.

[anya gives her hand to lopakhin and pischin and goes out, shutting the
door behind her.]

lubov. sheâ€™s awfully tired.

pischin. itâ€™s a very long journey.

think, â€œeverythingâ€™s lost now. iâ€™m a dead man,â€ when, lo and behold, a
railway was built over my land... and they paid me for it. and something
else will happen to-day or to-morrow. dashenka may win 20,000 roubles...
sheâ€™s got a lottery ticket.

lubov. the coffeeâ€™s all gone, we can go to bed.

fiers. [brushing gaevâ€™s trousers; in an insistent tone] youâ€™ve put on
the wrong trousers again. what am i to do with you?

varya. [quietly] anyaâ€™s asleep. [opens window quietly] the sun has risen
already; it isnâ€™t cold. look, little mother: what lovely trees! and the
air! the starlings are singing!

gaev. [opens the other window] the whole gardenâ€™s white. you havenâ€™t
forgotten, luba? thereâ€™s that long avenue going straight, straight, like
a stretched strap; it shines on moonlight nights. do you remember? you
havenâ€™t forgotten?

innocence! in this nursery i used

[lubov andreyevna embraces him and cries softly.]

gaev. [confused] thatâ€™s enough, thatâ€™s enough, luba.

varya. [weeps] but i told you, peter, to wait till to-morrow.

lubov. my grisha... my boy... grisha... my son.

varya. what are we to do, little mother? itâ€™s the will of god.

trofimov. [softly, through his tears] itâ€™s all right, itâ€™s all right.

lubov. [still weeping] my boyâ€™s dead; he was drowned. why? why, my
friend? [softly] anyaâ€™s asleep in there. i am speaking so loudly, making
such a noise.... well, peter? whatâ€™s made you look so bad? why have you
grown so old?

trofimov. in the train an old woman called me a decayed gentleman.

lubov. you were quite a boy then, a nice little student, and now your
hair is not at all thick and you wear spectacles. are you really still a
student? [goes to the door.]

trofimov. i suppose i shall always be a student.

lubov. [kisses her brother, then varya] well, letâ€™s go to bed...

as well. [exit.]

varya. mother hasnâ€™t altered a scrap, sheâ€™s just as she always was.
sheâ€™d give away everything, if the idea only entered her head.

gaev. yes.... [pause] if thereâ€™s any illness for which people offer many
remedies, you may be sure that particular illness is incurable, i think.
i work my brains to their hardest. iâ€™ve several remedies, very many,
and that really means iâ€™ve none at all. it would be nice to inherit a
fortune from somebody, it would be nice to marry our anya to a rich
man, it would be nice to go to yaroslav and try my luck with my aunt the
countess. my aunt is very, very rich.

varya. [weeps] if only god helped us.

gaev. donâ€™t cry. my auntâ€™s very rich, but she doesnâ€™t like us. my
sister, in the first place, married an advocate, not a noble.... [anya
appears in the doorway] she not only married a man who was not a noble,
but she behaved herself in a way which cannot be described as proper.
sheâ€™s nice and kind and charming, and iâ€™m very fo

you can feel it in her slightest movements.

varya. [whispers] anyaâ€™s in the doorway.

gaev. really? [pause] itâ€™s curious, somethingâ€™s got into my right eye...
i canâ€™t see properly out of it. and on thursday, when i was at the
district court...

[enter anya.]

varya. why arenâ€™t you in bed, anya?

anya. canâ€™t sleep. itâ€™s no good.

gaev. my darling! [kisses anyaâ€™s face and hands] my child.... [crying]
youâ€™re not my niece, youâ€™re my angel, youâ€™re my all.... believe in me,
believe...

anya. i do believe in you, uncle. everybody loves you and respects
you... but, uncle dear, you ought to say nothing, no more than that.
what were you saying just now about my mother, your own sister? why did
you say those things?

gaev. yes, yes. [covers his face with her hand] yes, really, it was
awful. save me, my god! and only just now i made a speech before a

varya. yes, uncle dear, you really ought to say less. keep quiet, thatâ€™s
all.

anya. youâ€™d be so much happier in yourself if you only kept quiet.

gaev. all right, iâ€™ll be quiet. [kisses their hands] iâ€™ll be quiet. but
letâ€™s talk business. on thursday i was in the district court, and a lot
of us met there together, and we began to talk of this, that, and the
other, and now i think i can arrange a loan to pay the interest into the
bank.

varya. if only god would help us!

the fire, and weâ€™ll be safe. weâ€™ll pay up the interest. iâ€™m certain.
[puts some sugar-candy into his mouth] i swear on my honour, on anything
you will, that the estate will not be sold! [excitedly] i swear on my
happiness! hereâ€™s my hand. you may call me a dishonourable wretch if i
let it go to auction! i swear by all i am!

anya. [she is calm again and happy] how good and clever you are, uncle.
[embraces him] iâ€™m happy now! iâ€™m happy! allâ€™s well!

fiers. [reproachfully] leonid andreyevitch, donâ€™t you fear god? when are
you going to bed?

gaev. soon, soon. you go away, fiers. iâ€™ll undress myself. well,
children, bye-bye...! iâ€™ll give you the details to-morrow, but letâ€™s go

varya. be quiet, uncle!

the middle! i turn over a new leaf.... [exit. fiers goes out after him.]

grandmother; but iâ€™m calm now; thanks to uncle. [sits down.]

varya. itâ€™s time to go to sleep. iâ€™ll go. thereâ€™s been an unpleasantness
here while you were away. in the old servantsâ€™ part of the house, as you
know, only the old people live--little old efim and polya and evstigney,
and karp as well. they started letting some tramps or other spend the
night there--i said nothing. then i heard that they were saying that

[yawns] he comes. â€œwhatâ€™s this,â€ i say, â€œevstigney, you old fool.â€...

the orchard, a shepherd plays his pipe. trofimov crosses the stage and

promised an introduction to a general who may lend me money on a bill.

lopakhin. nothing will come of it. and you wonâ€™t pay your interest,

forests, infinite fields, and endless horizons, and we, living here,
ought really to be giants.â€

lubov. you want giants, do you?... theyâ€™re only good in stories, and
even there they frighten one. [epikhodov enters at the back of the stage
playing his guitar. thoughtfully:] epikhodovâ€™s there.

lubov. [shudders] itâ€™s unpleasant, somehow. [a pause.]

fiers. before the misfortune the same thing happened. an owl screamed
and the samovar hummed without stopping.

gaev. before what misfortune?

fiers. before the emancipation. [a pause.]

youâ€™ve tears in your eyes.... what is it, little girl? [embraces her.]

cherry orchard will be sold. think of that!... think of that!...

now.

trofimov. varyaâ€™s afraid we may fall in love with each other and wonâ€™t
get away from us for days on end. her narrow mind wonâ€™t allow her to
understand that we are above love. to escape all the petty and deceptive
things which prevent our being happy and free, that is the aim and

as i used to. i loved it so tenderly, i thought there was no better
place in the world than our orchard.

trofimov. all russia is our orchard. the land is great and beautiful,
there are many marvellous places in it. [pause] think, anya, your
grandfather, your great-grandfather, and all your ancestors were
serf-owners, they owned living souls; and now, doesnâ€™t something human
look at you from every cherry in the orchard, every leaf and every
stalk? donâ€™t you hear voices...? oh, itâ€™s awful, your orchard is
terrible; and when in the evening or at night you walk through the
orchard, then the old bark on the trees sheds a dim light and the old
cherry-trees seem to be dreaming of all that was a hundred, two hundred
years ago,

rate, weâ€™ve left those two hundred years behind us. so far weâ€™ve gained
nothing at all--we donâ€™t yet know what the past is to be to us--we only
philosophize, we complain that we are dull, or we drink vodka. for itâ€™s
so clear that in order to begin to live in the present we must first
redeem the past, and that can only be done by suffering, by strenuous,
uninterrupted labour. understand that, anya.

trofimov. yes, the moon has risen. [pause] there is happiness, there it
comes; it comes nearer and nearer; i hear its steps already. and if we

in another room. evening. in the drawing-room the grand rond is being
danced. voice of simeonov pischin â€œpromenade a une paire!â€ dancers
come into the reception-room; the first pair are pischin and charlotta
ivanovna; the second, trofimov and lubov andreyevna; the third, anya and
the post office clerk; the fourth, varya and the station-master, and
so on. varya is crying gently and wipes away her tears as she dances.
dunyasha is in the last pair. they go off into the drawing-room,

trofimov. [slaps pischin on the shoulder] oh, you horse!

charlotta. attention please, hereâ€™s another trick. [takes a shawl from a
chair] hereâ€™s a very nice plaid shawl, iâ€™m going to sell it.... [shakes
it] wonâ€™t anybody buy it?

pischin. [astonished] think of that now!

charlotta. _ein, zwei, drei_.

[she quickly lifts up the shawl, which is hanging down. anya is standing
behind it; she bows and runs to her mother, hugs her and runs back to
the drawing-room amid general applause.]

lubov. [applauds] bravo, bravo!

charlotta. once again! _ein, zwei, drei_!

[lifts the shawl. varya stands behind it and bows.]

pischin. [astonished] think of that, now.

charlotta. the end!

or, if the sale never came off, then why does he stay so long?

varya. [tries to soothe her] uncle has bought it. iâ€™m certain of it.

trofimov. [sarcastically] oh, yes!

varya. grandmother sent him her authority for him to buy it in her name
and transfer the debt to her. sheâ€™s doing it for anya. and iâ€™m certain
that god will help us and uncle will buy it.

lubov. grandmother sent fifteen thousand roubles from yaroslav to buy
the property in her name--she wonâ€™t trust us--and that wasnâ€™t even
enough to pay the interest. [covers her face with her hands] my fate
will be settled to-day, my fate....

the university.

varya. why is epikhodov here? who said he could play billiards? i donâ€™t
understand these people. [exit.]

lubov. donâ€™t tease her, peter, you see that sheâ€™s quite unhappy without
that.

trofimov. she takes too much on herself, she keeps on interfering in
other peopleâ€™s business. the whole summer sheâ€™s given no peace to me or
to anya, sheâ€™s afraid weâ€™ll have a romance all to ourselves. what has it
to do with her? as if iâ€™d ever given her grounds to believe iâ€™d stoop to
such vulgarity! we are above love.

lubov. then i suppose i must be beneath love. [in agitation] why isnâ€™t
leonid here? if i only knew whether the estate is sold or not! the
disaster seems to me so improbable that i donâ€™t know what to think, iâ€™m
all at sea... i may scream... or do something silly. save me, peter. say

another handkerchief, a telegram falls on the floor] iâ€™m so sick at
heart to-day, you canâ€™t imagine. here itâ€™s so noisy, my soul shakes at
every sound. i shake all over, and i canâ€™t go away by myself, iâ€™m afraid
of the silence. donâ€™t judge me harshly, peter... i loved you, as if you
belonged to my family. iâ€™d gladly let anya marry you, i swear it, only
dear, you ought to work, finish your studies. you donâ€™t do anything,
only fate throws you about from place to place, itâ€™s so odd.... isnâ€™t it
true? yes? and you ought to do something to your beard to make it grow
better [laughs] you are funny!

up into the drawing-room, clutching his head] itâ€™s awful... i canâ€™t
stand it, iâ€™ll go away. [exit, but returns at once] all is over between
us! [exit.]

cherry orchard was sold to-day.

reception-room with trofimov.]

yasha. some old man was chattering about it a long time ago. a stranger!

fiers. and leonid andreyevitch isnâ€™t here yet, he hasnâ€™t come. heâ€™s
wearing a light, _demi-saison_ overcoat. heâ€™ll catch cold. oh these
young fellows.

act four


[the stage is set as for act i. there are no curtains on the windows, no
pictures; only a few pieces of furniture are left; they are piled up in
a corner as if for sale. the emptiness is felt. by the door that
leads out of the house and at the back of the stage, portmanteaux and
travelling paraphernalia are piled up. the door on the left is open; the
voices of varya and anya can be heard through it. lopakhin stands and
waits. yasha holds a tray with little tumblers of champagne. outside,
epikhodov is tying up a box. voices are heard behind the stage. the
peasants have come to say good-bye. the voice of gaev is heard: â€œthank
you, brothers, thank you.â€]

yasha. the common people have come to say good-bye. i am of the
opinion, ermolai alexeyevitch, that theyâ€™re good people, but they donâ€™t
understand very much.

it were summer. good for building. [looking at his watch and speaking
through the door] ladies and gentlemen, please remember that itâ€™s only
forty-seven minutes till the train goes! you must go off to the station
in twenty minutes. hurry up.

[trofimov, in an overcoat, comes in from the grounds.]

trofimov. i think itâ€™s time we went. the carriages are waiting. where
the devil are my goloshes? theyâ€™re lost. [through the door] anya, i
canâ€™t find my goloshes! i canâ€™t!

lopakhin. iâ€™ve got to go to kharkov. iâ€™m going in the same train as you.
iâ€™m going to spend the whole winter in kharkov. iâ€™ve been hanging about
with you people, going rusty without work. i canâ€™t live without working.
i must have something to do with my hands; they hang about as if they
werenâ€™t mine at all.

trofimov. weâ€™ll go away now and then youâ€™ll start again on your useful
labours.

lopakhin. have a glass.

trofimov. i wonâ€™t.

d man. itâ€™s time to go. here we stand
pulling one anotherâ€™s noses, but life goes its own way all the time.
when i work for a long time, and i donâ€™t get tired, then i think more
easily, and i think i get to understand why i exist. and there are so
many people in russia, brother, who live for nothing at all. still, work
goes on without that. leonid andreyevitch, they say, has accepted a post
in a bank; he will get sixty thousand roubles a year.... but he wonâ€™t
stand it; heâ€™s very lazy.

anya. [at the door] mother asks if you will stop them cutting down the
orchard until she has gone away.

trofimov. yes, really, you ought to have enough tact not to do that.
[exit.]

lopakhin, all right, all right... yes, heâ€™s right. [exit.]

anya. has fiers been sent to the hospital?

yasha. i gave the order this morning. i suppose theyâ€™ve sent him.

anya. [to epikhodov, who crosses the room] simeon panteleyevitch, please
make inquiries if fiers has been sent to the hospital.

yasha. [offended]

 i told egor this morning. whatâ€™s the use of asking ten
times!

epikhodov. the aged fiers, in my conclusive opinion, isnâ€™t worth
mending; his forefathers had better have him. i only envy him. [puts
a trunk on a hat-box and squashes it] well, of course. i thought so!
[exit.]

yasha. [grinning] two-and-twenty troubles.

varya. [behind the door] has fiers been taken away to the hospital?

anya. yes.

varya. why didnâ€™t they take the letter to the doctor?

anya. itâ€™ll have to be sent after him. [exit.]

varya. [in the next room] whereâ€™s yasha? tell him his motherâ€™s come and
wants to say good-bye to him.

yasha. [waving his hand] sheâ€™ll make me lose all patience!

[dunyasha has meanwhile been bustling round the luggage; now that yasha
is left alone, she goes up to him.]

dunyasha. if you only looked at me once, yasha. youâ€™re going away,
leaving me behind.

yourself properly, and then you wonâ€™t cry.

dunyasha. [looks in a small mirror and powders her face] send me a
letter from paris. you know i loved you, yasha, so much! iâ€™m a sensitive
creature, yasha.

yasha. somebodyâ€™s coming.

gaev, anya, and charlotta ivanovna.]

gaev. weâ€™d better be off. thereâ€™s no time left. [looks at yasha]
somebody smells of herring!

lubov. we neednâ€™t get into our carriages for ten minutes.... [looks
round the room] good-bye, dear house, old grandfather. the winter will
go, the spring will come, and then youâ€™ll exist no more, youâ€™ll be
pulled down. how much these walls have seen! [passionately kisses her
daughter] my treasure, youâ€™re radiant, your eyes flash like two jewels!

anya. very! a new life is beginning, mother!

gaev. [gaily] yes, really, everythingâ€™s all right now. before the cherry
orchard was sold we all were excited and we suffered, and then, when
the question was solved once and for all, we all calmed down, and even
became cheerful. iâ€™m a bank official now, and a financier... red in the
middle; and you, luba, for some reason or other, look better, thereâ€™s no
doubt about it.

lubov yes. my nerves are better, itâ€™s true. [she puts on her coat and
hat]

little girl, weâ€™ll soon see each other again.... iâ€™m off to paris. iâ€™ll
live there on the money your grandmother from yaroslav sent along to buy
the estate--bless her!--though it wonâ€™t last long.

anya. youâ€™ll come back soon, soon, mother, wonâ€™t you? iâ€™ll get ready,
and pass the exam at the higher school, and then iâ€™ll work and help
you. weâ€™ll read all sorts of books to one another, wonâ€™t we? [kisses
her motherâ€™s hands] weâ€™ll read in the autumn evenings; weâ€™ll read
many books, and a beautiful new world will open up before us....

anya. mother, fiers has already been sent to the hospital. yasha sent
him off this morning.

lubov. the second is varya. sheâ€™s used to getting up early and to work,
and now sheâ€™s no work to do sheâ€™s like a fish out of water. sheâ€™s grown
thin and pale, and she cries, poor thing.... [pause] you know very well,

lubov. well? [pause] we must go.

varya. [not crying now, wipes her eyes] yes, itâ€™s quite time, little
mother. iâ€™ll get to the ragulins to-day, if i donâ€™t miss the train....

lubov. [at the door] anya, put on your things. [enter anya, then gaev,

and drivers come in. epikhodov bustles around the luggage] now we can go

with her little dog, go out.]
