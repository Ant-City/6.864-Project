men, and we will have a good talk. stay then, and do not be perverse.

glaucon said: i suppose, since you insist, that we must.

very good, i replied.

accordingly we went with polemarchus to his house; and there we found
his brothers lysias and euthydemus, and with them thrasymachus the
chalcedonian, charmantides the paeanian, and cleitophon the son of
aristonymus. there too was cephalus the father of polemarchus, whom i
had not seen for a long time, and i thought him very much aged. he was
seated on a cushioned chair, and had a garland on his head, for he had
been sacrificing in the court; and there were some other chairs in the
room arranged in a semicircle, upon which we sat down by him. he saluted
me eagerly, and then he said:--

you don't come to see me, socrates, as often as you ought: if i were
still able to go and see you i would not ask you to come to me. but
at my age i can hardly get to the city, and therefore you should come
oftener to the pi

y true, but may i ask another question?--what do you
consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your
wealth?

one, he said, of which i could not expect easily to convince others.
for let me tell you, socrates, that when a man thinks himself to be near
death, fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had before;
the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exacted there
of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him, but now he
is tormented with the thought that they may be true: either from the
weakness of age, or because he is now drawing nearer to that other
place, he has a clearer view of these things; suspicions and alarms
crowd thickly upon him, and he begins to reflect and consider what
wrongs he has done to others. and when he finds that the sum of his
transgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up in his
sleep for fear, and he is filled with dark forebodings. but to him who
is conscious of no sin, sweet hope, as pindar

has friends who are bad friends, and in that case he ought to do harm to
them; and he has good enemies whom he ought to benefit; but, if so, we
shall be saying the very opposite of that which we affirmed to be the
meaning of simonides.

very true, he said: and i think that we had better correct an error
into which we seem to have fallen in the use of the words 'friend' and
'enemy.'

what was the error, polemarchus? i asked.

we assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thought good.

and how is the error to be corrected?

we should rather say that he is a friend who is, as well as seems, good;
and that he who seems only, and is not good, only seems to be and is not
a friend; and of an enemy the same may be said.

you would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our enemies?

yes.

and instead of saying simply as we did at first, that it is just to do
good to our friends and harm to our enemies, we should further say: it
is just to do good to our friends when

of his own, is told by a man of authority not to utter them? the
natural thing is, that the speaker should be some one like yourself
who professes to know and can tell what he knows. will you then kindly
answer, for the edification of the company and of myself?

glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request, and
thrasymachus, as any one might see, was in reality eager to speak;
for he thought that he had an excellent answer, and would distinguish
himself. but at first he affected to insist on my answering; at length
he consented to begin. behold, he said, the wisdom of socrates; he
refuses to teach himself, and goes about learning of others, to whom he
never even says thank you.

that i learn of others, i replied, is quite true; but that i am
ungrateful i wholly deny. money i have none, and therefore i pay in

commanded by their rulers is just.

yes, cleitophon, but he also said that justice is the interest of the
stronger, and, while admitting both these propositions, he further
acknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are his
subjects to do what is not for his own interest; whence follows that
justice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger.

but, said cleitophon, he meant by the interest of the stronger what the
stronger thought to be his interest,--this was what the weaker had to
do; and this was affirmed by him to be justice.

those were not his words, rejoined polemarchus.

never mind, i replied, if he now says that they are, let us accept his
statement. tell me, thrasymachus, i said, did you mean by justice what
the stronger thought to be his interest, whether really so or not?

certainly not, he said. do you suppose that i call him who is mistaken
the stronger at the time when he is mistaken?

leave us. thrasymachus, i said to him, excellent man, how suggestive
are your remarks! and are you going to run away before you have fairly
taught or learned whether they are true or not? is the attempt to
determine the way of man's life so small a matter in your eyes--to
determine how life may be passed by each one of us to the greatest
advantage?

and do i differ from you, he said, as to the importance of the enquiry?

you appear rather, i replied, to have no care or thought about us,
thrasymachus--whether we live better or worse from not knowing what you
say you know, is to you a matter of indifference. prithee, friend,
do not keep your knowledge to yourself; we are a large party; and any
benefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded. for my own
part i openly declare that i am not convinced, and that i do not believe
injustice to be more gainful than justice, even if uncontrolled and
allowed to have free play. for, granting that there may be an unjust

said, if you are not already convinced
by what i have just said; what more can i do for you? would you have me
put the proof bodily into your souls?

heaven forbid! i said; i would only ask you to be consistent; or, if you
change, change openly and let there be no deception. for i must remark,
thrasymachus, if you will recall what was previously said, that although
you began by defining the true physician in an exact sense, you did not
observe a like exactness when speaking of the shepherd; you thought that
the shepherd as a shepherd tends the sheep not with a view to their own
good, but like a mere diner or banquetter with a view to the pleasures
of the table; or, again, as a trader for sale in the market, and not as
a shepherd. yet surely the art of the shepherd is concerned only with
the good of his subjects; he has only to provide the best for them,
since the perfection of the art is already ensured whenever all the
requirements of it are satisfied. and that was what i was saying just

not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him
individually, but of necessity, for wherever any one thinks that he
can safely be unjust, there he is unjust. for all men believe in their
hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than
justice, and he who argues as i have been supposing, will say that they
are right. if you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming
invisible, and never doing any wrong or touching what was another's, he
would be thought by the lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot, although
they would praise him to one another's faces, and keep up appearances
with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice.
enough of this.

now, if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and
unjust, we must isolate them; there is no other way; and how is the
isolation to be effected? i answer: let the unjust man be entirely
unjust, and the just man entirely just; nothing is to be taken away from
either of them
 
 ___________________________
 
let us place the just man in his nobleness and simplicity,
wishing, as aeschylus says, to be and not to seem good. there must be no
seeming, for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded, and
then we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or
for the sake of honours and rewards; therefore, let him be clothed in
justice only, and have no other covering; and he must be imagined in a
state of life the opposite of the former. let him be the best of men,
and let him be thought the worst; then he will have been put to the
proof; and we shall see whether he will be affected by the fear of
infamy and its consequences. and let him continue thus to the hour of
death; being just and seeming to be unjust. when both have reached the
uttermost extreme, the one of justice and the other of injustice, let
judgment be given which of them is the happier of the two.

heavens! my dear glaucon, i said, how energetically you polish them
up for the decision, first one and then the othe

i do my best, he said. and now that we know what they are like there
is no difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either
of them. this i will proceed to describe; but as you may think the
description a little too coarse, i ask you to suppose, socrates, that
the words which follow are not mine.--let me put them into the mouths of
the eulogists of injustice: they will tell you that the just man who is
thought unjust will be scourged, racked, bound--will have his eyes
burnt out; and, at last, after suffering every kind of evil, he will be
impaled: then he will understand that he ought to seem only, and not to
be, just; the words of aeschylus may be more truly spoken of the unjust
than of the just. for the unjust is pursuing a reality; he does not live
with a view to appearances--he wants to be really unjust and not to seem
only:--

'his mind has a soil deep and fertile, out of which spring his pruden

counsels.'

in the first place, he is thought just, and therefore bears rule in the
city; he can marry whom he will, and give in marriage to whom he
will; also he can trade and deal where he likes, and always to his own
advantage, because he has no misgivings about injustice; and at every
contest, whether in public or private, he gets the better of his
antagonists, and gains at their expense, and is rich, and out of his
gains he can benefit his friends, and harm his enemies; moreover, he
can offer sacrifices, and dedicate gifts to the gods

them, i mean, who are
quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every flower, and from
all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of
persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would
make the best of life? probably the youth will say to himself in the
words of pindar--

'can i by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower
which may be a fortress to me all my days?'

for what men say is that, if i am really just and am not also thought
just profit there is none, but the pain and loss on the other hand
are unmistakeable. but if, though unjust, i acquire the reputation of
justice, a heavenly life is promised to me. since then, as philosophers
prove, appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness, to
appearance i must devote myself. i will describe around me a picture and
shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior of my house; behind i
will trail the subtle and crafty fox, as archilochus, greatest of sages,

our own arguments. and i do believe that
you are not convinced--this i infer from your general character, for had
i judged only from your speeches i should have mistrusted you. but
now, the greater my confidence in you, the greater is my difficulty in
knowing what to say. for i am in a strait between two; on the one hand i
feel that i am unequal to the task; and my inability is brought home to
me by the fact that you were not satisfied with the answer which i made
to thrasymachus, proving, as i thought, the superiority which justice
has over injustice. and yet i cannot refuse to help, while breath and
speech remain to me; i am afraid that there would be an impiety in being
present when justice is evil spoken of and not lifting up a hand in her
defence. and therefore i had best give such help as i can.

glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question
drop, but to proceed in the investigation. they wanted to arrive at the
truth, first, about the nature of justice and inju

stice, and secondly,
about their relative advantages. i told them, what i really thought,
that the enquiry would be of a serious nature, and would require very
good eyes. seeing then, i said, that we are no great wits, i think that
we had better adopt a method which i may illustrate thus; suppose that
a short-sighted person had been asked by some one to read small letters
from a distance; and it occurred to some one else that they might be
found in another place which was larger and in which the letters were
larger--if they were the same and he could read the larger letters
first, 
 
 ___________________________
 
and then proceed to the lesser--this would have been thought a
rare piece of good fortune.

very true, said adeimantus; but how does the illustration apply to our
enquiry?

i will tell you, i replied; justice, which is the subject of our
enquiry, is, as you know, sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an
individual, and sometimes as the virtue of a state.

true, he replied.

and is not a state larger than an individual?

it is.

then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and
more easily discernible. i propose therefore that we enquir

provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself;
or will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of
producing for them, but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food
in a fourth of the time, and in the remaining three fourths of his time
be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes, having no
partnership with others, but supplying himself all his own wants?

adeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not at
producing everything.

probably, i replied, that would be the better way; and when i hear you
say this, i am myself reminded that we are not all alike; there
are diversities of natures among us which are adapted to different
occupations.

very true.

and will you have a work better done when the workman has many
occupations, or when he has only one?

when he has only one.

further, there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at

undoubtedly.

then we have found the desired natures; and now that we have found them,
how are they to be reared and educated? is not this an enquiry which
may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final
end--how do justice and injustice grow up in states? for we do not want
either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an
inconvenient length.

adeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us.

then, i said, my dear friend, the task must not be given up, even if
somewhat long.

certainly not.

come then, and let us pass a leisure hour in story-telling, and our
story shall be the education of our heroes.

eness to the original.

yes, he said, that sort of thing is certainly very blameable; but what
are the stories which you mean?

first of all, i said, there was that greatest of all lies in high
places, which the poet told about uranus, and which was a bad lie
too,--i mean what hesiod says that uranus did, and how cronus retaliated
on him. the doings of cronus, and the sufferings which in turn his son
inflicted upon him, even if they were true, ought certainly not to be
lightly told to young and thoughtless persons; if possible, they had
better be buried in silence. but if there is an absolute necessity
for their mention, a chosen few might hear them in a mystery, and
they should sacrifice not a common (eleusinian) pig, but some huge and
unprocurable victim; and then the number of the hearers will be very few
indeed.

why, yes, said he, those stories are extremely objectionable.

yes, adeimantus, they are stories not to be repeated in our state; the
young man should not be told that in committ

us sent him flying
for taking her part when she was being beaten, and all the battles of
the gods in homer--these tales must not be admitted into our state,
whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or not. for
a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is literal;
anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely to become
indelible and unalterable; and therefore it is most important that the
tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts.

there you are right, he replied; but if any one asks where are such
models to be found and of what tales are you speaking--how shall we
answer him?

i said to him, you and i, adeimantus, at this moment are not poets,
but founders of a state: now the founders of a state ought to know the
general forms in which poets should cast their tales, and the limits
which must be observed by them, but to make the tales is not their
business.

very true, he said; but what are these forms of theology whic

not the author of all things, but of good only.

that will do, he said.

and what do you think of a second principle? shall i ask you whether god
is a magician, and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one shape,
and now in another--sometimes himself changing and passing into
many forms, sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such
transformations; or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own
proper image?

i cannot answer you, he said, without more thought.

well, i said; but if we suppose a change in anything, that change must
be effected either by the thing itself, or by some other thing?

most certainly.

and things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered
or discomposed; for example, when healthiest and strongest, the human
frame is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks, and the plant
which is in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the heat
of the sun or any similar causes.

of course.

and will no

or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies?

that is inconceivable.

but he may have friends who are senseless or mad?

but no mad or senseless person can be a friend of god.

then no motive can be imagined why god should lie?

none whatever.

then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood?

yes.

then is god perfectly simple and true both in word and deed; he changes
not; he deceives not, either by sign or word, by dream or waking vision.

your thoughts, he said, are the reflection of my own.

you agree with me then, i said, that this is the second type or form in
which we should write and speak about divine things. the gods are not
magicians who transform themselves, neither do they deceive mankind in
any way.

i grant that.

then, although we are admirers of homer, we do not admire the lying
dream which zeus sends to agamemnon; neither will we praise the verses
of aeschylus in which thetis says that apollo at her nuptials

'was celebrating

and to know no sickness. and when he had spoken of my lot as in all

prophecy, would not fail. and now he himself who uttered the strain,
he who was present at the banquet, and who said this--he it is who has
slain my son.'

these are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse our
anger; and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus; neither shall
we allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young,
meaning, as we do, that our guardians, as far as men can be, should be

yes, he said; and knowing this, they are quite right in not taking them.

then you would not approve of syracusan dinners, and the refinements of
sicilian cookery?

i think not.

nor, if a man is to be in condition, would you allow him to have a
corinthian girl as his fair friend?

certainly not.

neither would you approve of the delicacies, as they are thought, of
athenian confectionary?

certainly not.

all such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us to melody and
song composed in the panharmonic style, and in all the rhythms.

there complexity engendered licence, and here disease; whereas
simplicity in music was the parent of temperance in the soul; and
simplicity in gymnastic of health in the body.

ent to the application of the mind in carpentering and the
mechanical arts, does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of
phocylides?

of that, he replied, there can be no doubt; such excessive care of the
body, when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic, is most inimical to
the practice of virtue.

yes, indeed, i replied, and equally incompatible with the management of
a house, an army, or an office of state; and, what is most important
of all, irreconcileable with any kind of study or thought or
self-reflection--there is a constant suspicion that headache and
giddiness are to be ascribed to philosophy, and hence all practising or
making trial of virtue in the higher sense is absolutely stopped; for
a man is always fancying that he is being made ill, and is in constant
anxiety about the state of his body.

yes, likely enough.

and therefore our politic asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited
the power of his art only to persons who, being generally of healthy

his fellows, is wonderful in the precautions which he takes, because he
judges of them by himself: but when he gets into the company of men of
virtue, who have the experience of age, he appears to be a fool again,
owing to his unseasonable suspicions; he cannot recognise an honest man,
because he has no pattern of honesty in himself; at the same time, as
the bad are more numerous than the good, and he meets with them oftener,
he thinks himself, and is by others thought to be, rather wise than
foolish.

most true, he said.

then the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man, but
the other; for vice cannot know virtue too, but a virtuous nature,
educated by time, will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice: the
virtuous, and not the vicious, man has wisdom--in my opinion.

exactly.

and so in gymnastics, if a man takes violent exercise and is a great
feeder, and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy, at
first the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit,
and he becomes twice the man that he was.

certainly.

and what happens? if he do nothing else, and holds no converse with the
muses, does not even that intelligence which there may be in him, having
no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or culture,
grow feeble and dull and blind, his mind never waking up or receiving
nourishment, and his senses not being purged of their mists?

true, he said.

and he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy, uncivilized, never using
the weapon of persuasion,--he is like a wild beast, all violence and
fierceness, and knows no other way of dealing; and he lives in all
ignorance and evil conditions, and has no sense of propriety and grace.

that is quite true, he said.

and as there are two princip

saying just now, they have gold and silver, and all that is usual among
the favourites of fortune; but our poor citizens are no better than
mercenaries who are quartered in the city and are always mounting guard?

yes, i said; and you may add that they are only fed, and not paid in
addition to their food, like other men; and therefore they cannot, if
they would, take a journey of pleasure; they have no money to spend on
a mistress or any other luxurious fancy, which, as the world goes, is
thought to be happiness; and many other accusations of the same nature
might be added.

but, said he, let us suppose all this to be included in the charge.

you mean to ask, i said, what will be our answer?

yes.

if we proceed along the old path, my belief, i said, is that we shall
find the answer. and our answer will be that, even as they are, our
guardians may very likely be the happiest of men; but that our aim in
founding the state was not the disproportionate happiness of any one
class, but the g

state which is ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should
be most likely to find justice, and in the ill-ordered state injustice:
and, having found them, we might then decide which of the two is the
happier. at present, i take it, we are fashioning the happy state,
not piecemeal, or with a view of making a few happy citizens, but as a

and the vision which is then revealed we will fix in our souls.

that will be in regular course; let us do as you say.

i proceeded to ask: when two things, a greater and less, are called by
the same name, are they like or unlike in so far as they are called the
same?

like, he replied.

the just man then, if we regard the idea of justice only, will be like
the just state?

he will.

and a state was thought by us to be just when the three classes in the
state severally did their own business; and also thought to be temperate
and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections and qualities
of these same classes?

true, he said.

and so of the individual; we may assume that he has the same three
principles in his own soul which are found in the state; and he may be
rightly described in the same terms, because he is affected in the same
manner?

certainly, he said.

is still undetermined, and you are taking in hand another state, we have
resolved, as you heard, not to let you go until you give an account of
all this.

to that resolution, said glaucon, you may regard me as saying agreed.

and without more ado, said thrasymachus, you may consider us all to be
equally agreed.

i said, you know not what you are doing in thus assailing me: what an
argument are you raising about the state! just as i thought that i had
finished, and was only too glad that i had laid this question to sleep,
and was reflecting how fortunate i was in your acceptance of what i then
said, you ask me to begin again at the very foundation, ignorant of what
a hornet's nest of words you are stirring. now i foresaw this gathering
trouble, and avoided it.

for what purpose do you conceive that we have come here, said
thrasymachus,--to look for gold, or to hear discourse?

yes, but discourse should have a limit.

yes, socrates

several of our proposals, if they
are carried out, being unusual, may appear ridiculous.

no doubt of it.

yes, and the most ridiculous thing of all will be the sight of women
naked in the palaestra, exercising with the men, especially when they
are no longer young; they certainly will not be a vision of beauty, any
more than the enthusiastic old men who in spite of wrinkles and ugliness
continue to frequent the gymnasia.

yes, indeed, he said: according to present notions the proposal would be
thought ridiculous.

but then, i said, as we have determined to speak our minds, we must not
fear the jests of the wits which will be directed against this sort of
innovation; how they will talk of women's attainments both in music
and gymnastic, and above all about their wearing armour and riding upon
horseback!

very true, he replied.

yet having begun we must go forward to the rough places of the law; at
the same time begging of these gentlemen for once in their life to be

the possibility as well as the utility of such a law are far more
questionable.

i do not think, i said, that there can be any dispute about the very
great utility of having wives and children in common; the possibility is
quite another matter, and will be very much disputed.

i think that a good many doubts may be raised about both.

you imply that the two questions must be combined, i replied. now i
meant that you should admit the utility; and in this way, as i thought,
i should escape from one of them, and then there would remain only the
possibility.

but that little attempt is detected, and therefore you will please to
give a defence of both.

well, i said, i submit to my fate. yet grant me a little favour: let
me feast my mind with the dream as day dreamers are in the habit of
feasting themselves when they are walking alone; for before they have

and behold the light of day.' such was the thought, my dear glaucon,
which i would fain have uttered if it had not seemed too extravagant;
for to be convinced that in no other state can there be happiness
private or public is indeed a hard thing.

socrates, what do you mean? i would have you consider that the word
which you have uttered is one at which numerous persons, and very
respectable persons too, in a figure pulling off their coats all in a
moment, and seizing any weapon that comes to hand, will run at you might

i dare say that you remember, and therefore i need not remind you, that
a lover, if he is worthy of the name, ought to show his love, not to
some one part of that which he loves, but to the whole.

i really do not understand, and therefore beg of you to assist my
memory.

another person, i said, might fairly reply as you do; but a man of
pleasure like yourself ought to know that all who are in the flower of
youth do somehow or other raise a pang or emotion in a lover's breast,
and are thought by him to be worthy of his affectionate regards. is not
this a way which you have with the fair: one has a snub nose, and you
praise his charming face; the hook-nose of another has, you say, a
royal look; while he who is neither snub nor hooked has the grace of
regularity: the dark visage is manly, the fair are children of the gods;
and as to the sweet 'honey pale,' as they are called, what is the very
name but the invention of a lover who talks in diminutives, and is not

belongs to his art, if he intends to be really qualified for the command
of a ship, and that he must and will be the steerer, whether other
people like or not--the possibility of this union of authority with the
steerer's art has never seriously entered into their thoughts or been
made part of their calling. now in vessels which are in a state of
mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers, how will the true pilot be
regarded? will he not be called by them a prater, a star-gazer, a
good-for-nothing?

of course, said adeimantus.

then you will hardly need, i said, to hear the interpretation of the
figure, which describes the true philosopher in his relation to the
state; for you understand already.

certainly.

then suppose you now take this parable to the gentleman

their perfect beauty must take a longer and more circuitous way, at
the end of which they would appear; but that we could add on a popular
exposition of them on a level with the discussion which had preceded.
and you replied that such an exposition would be enough for you, and so
the enquiry was continued in what to me seemed to be a very inaccurate
manner; whether you were satisfied or not, it is for you to say.

yes, he said, i thought and the others thought that you gave us a fair
measure of truth.

but, my friend, i said, a measure of such things which in any degree
falls short of the whole truth is not fair measure; for nothing
imperfect is the measure of anything, although persons are too apt to be
contented and think that they need search no further.

not an uncommon case when people are indolent.

yes, i said; and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of the
state and of the laws.

true.

s there a knowledge still higher than this--higher than
justice and the other virtues?

yes, i said, there is. and of the virtues too we must behold not the
outline merely, as at present--nothing short of the most finished
picture should satisfy us. when little things are elaborated with an
infinity of pains, in order that they may appear in their full beauty
and utmost clearness, how ridiculous that we should not think the
highest truths worthy of attaining the highest accuracy!

a right noble thought; but do you suppose that we shall refrain from
asking you what is this highest knowledge?

nay, i said, ask if you will; but i am certain that you have heard the
answer many times, and now you either do not understand me or, as i
rather think, you are disposed to be troublesome; for you have often
been told that the idea of good is the highest knowledge, and that all
other things become useful and advantageous only by their use of this.
you can hardly be ignorant that of this i was about to spe

that, he said, is a shrewd suspicion of yours.

and if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our state will be
perfectly ordered?

of course, he replied; but i wish that you would tell me whether you
conceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure,
or different from either?

aye, i said, i knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you would
not be contented with the thoughts of other people about these matters.

true, socrates; but i must say that one who like you has passed a
lifetime in the study of philosophy should not be always repeating the
opinions of others, and never telling his own.

well, but has any one a right to say positively what he does not know?

not, he said, with the assurance of positive certainty; he has no right
to do that: but he may say what he thinks, as a matter of opinion.

and do you not know, i said, that all mere opinions are bad, an

crates, said glaucon, not to turn away just
as you are reaching the goal; if you will only give such an explanation
of the good as you have already given of justice and temperance and the
other virtues, we shall be satisfied.

yes, my friend, and i shall be at least equally satisfied, but i cannot
help fearing that i shall fail, and that my indiscreet zeal will bring
ridicule upon me. no, sweet sirs, let us not at present ask what is the
actual nature of the good, for to reach what is now in my thoughts
would be an effort too great for me. but of the child of the good who
is likest him, i would fain speak, if i could be sure that you wished to
hear--otherwise, not.

by all means, he said, tell us about the child, and you shall remain in
our debt for the account of the parent.

i do indeed wish, i replied, that i could pay, and you receive, the
account of the parent, and not, as now, of the offspring only; take,
however, this latter by way of interest, and at the same time have a

will you explain your meaning? he said.

i will try, i said; and i wish you would share the enquiry with me,
and say 'yes' or 'no' when i attempt to distinguish in my own mind what
branches of knowledge have this attracting power, in order that we may
have clearer proof that arithmetic is, as i suspect, one of them.

explain, he said.

i mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds; some of them do
not invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them; while
in the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that further
enquiry is imperatively demanded.

you are clearly referring, he said, to the manner in which the senses
are imposed upon by distance, and by painting in light and shade.

no, i said, that is not at all my meaning.

then what is your meaning?

when speaking of uninviting objects, i mean those which do not pass from
one sensation to the opposite; inviting objects are those wh

very good.

you may suppose that they are seen quite close: and here comes the
point.

what is it?

each of them equally appears a finger, whether seen in the middle or
at the extremity, whether white or black, or thick or thin--it makes no
difference; a finger is a finger all the same. in these cases a man is
not compelled to ask of thought the question what is a finger? for the
sight never intimates to the mind that a finger is other than a finger.

true.

and therefore, i said, as we might expect, there is nothing here which
invites or excites intelligence.

there is not, he said.

but is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers?
can sight adequately perceive them? and is no difference made by the
circumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another at
the extremity? and in like manner does th

very true.

was not this the beginning of the enquiry 'what is great?' and 'what is
small?'

exactly so.

and thus arose the distinction of the visible and the intelligible.

most true.

this was what i meant when i spoke of impressions which invited the
intellect, or the reverse--those which are simultaneous with opposite
impressions, invite thought; those which are not simultaneous do not.

i understand, he said, and agree with you.

and to which class do unity and number belong?

i do not know, he replied.

think a little and you will see that what has preceded will supply the
answer; for if simple unity could be adequately perceived by the sight
or by any other sense, then, as we were saying in the case of the
finger, there would be nothing to attract towards being; but when there
is some contradiction always present, and one is the rev

involves the conception of plurality, then thought begins to be aroused
within us, and the soul perplexed and wanting to arrive at a decision
asks 'what is absolute unity?' this is the way in which the study of the
one has a power of drawing and converting the mind to the contemplation
of true being.

and surely, he said, this occurs notably in the case of one; for we see
the same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude?

yes, i said; and this being true of one must be equally true of all
number?

certainly.

and all arithmetic and calcu

ctions of one continue to be units.), taking
care that one shall continue one and not become lost in fractions.

that is very true.

now, suppose a person were to say to them: o my friends, what are these
wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning, in which, as you say,
there is a unity such as you demand, and each unit is equal, invariable,
indivisible,--what would they answer?

they would answer, as i should conceive, that they were speaking of
those numbers which can only be realized in thought.

then you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary,
necessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in the
attainment of pure truth?

yes; that is a marked characteristic of it.

and have you further observed, that those who have a natural talent for
calculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge; and
even the dull, if they have had an arithmetical training, although they
may derive no other advantage from it, always become much quicker than

and it is equally absurd to take so much pains in investigating their
exact truth.

i quite agree, though i never thought of this before.

then, i said, in astronomy, as in geometry, we should employ problems,
and let the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the right
way and so make the natural gift of reason to be of any real use.

that, he said, is a work infinitely beyond our present astronomers.

yes, i said; and there are many other things which must also have a
similar extension given to them, if our legislation is to be of any
value. but can you tell me of any other suitable study?

when we have realities of such importance to consider?

why indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the thought
of the mind with clearness?

at any rate, we are satisfied, as before, to have four divisions;
two for intellect and two for opinion, and to call the first division
science, the second understanding, the third belief, and the fourth
perception of shadows, opinion being concerned with becoming, and
intellect with being; and so to make a proportion:--

and how does the son come into being?

the character of the son begins to develope when he hears his mother
complaining that her husband has no place in the government, of which
the consequence is that she has no precedence among other women.
further, when she sees her husband not very eager about money, and
instead of battling and railing in the law courts or assembly, taking
whatever happens to him quietly; and when she observes that his thoughts
always centre in himself, while he treats her with very considerable
indifference, she is annoyed, and says to her son that his father is
only half a man and far too easy-going: adding all the other complaints
about her own ill-treatment which women are so fond of rehearsing.

yes, said adeimantus, they give us plenty of them, and their complaints
are so like themselves.

metic, and the stranger is quite as good as either.

yes, he said, that is the way.

and these are not the only evils, i said--there are several lesser ones:
in such a state of society the master fears and flatters his scholars,
and the scholars despise their masters and tutors; young and old are
all alike; and the young man is on a level with the old, and is ready
to compete with him in word or deed; and old men condescend to the
young and are full of pleasantry and gaiety; they are loth to be thought
morose and authoritative, and therefore they adopt the manners of the
young.

quite true, he said.

the last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with money,
whether male or female, is just as free as his or her purchaser; nor
must i forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes in
relation to each other.

incest or any other unnatural union, or parricide, or the eating of
forbidden food--which at such a time, when he has parted company with
all shame and sense, a man may not be ready to commit.

but when a man's pulse is healthy and temperate, and when before going
to sleep he has awakened his rational powers, and fed them on noble
thoughts and enquiries, collecting himself in meditation; after having
first indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little, but just
enough to lay them to sleep, and prevent them and their enjoyments and
pains from interfering with the higher principle--which he leaves in
the solitude of pure abstraction, free to contemplate and aspire to
the knowledge of the unknown, whether in past, present, or future: when
again he has allayed the passionate element, if he has a quarrel against

i think, he said, that we may fairly designate him as the imitator of
that which the others make.

good, i said; then you call him who is third in the descent from nature
an imitator?

certainly, he said.

and the tragic poet is an imitator, and therefore, like all other
imitators, he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth?

that appears to be so.

then about the imitator we are agreed. and what about the painter?--i
would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which
originally exists in nature, or only the creations of artists?

the latter.

as they are or as they appear? you have still to determine this.

what do you mean?

i mean, that you may look at a bed from different points of view,
obliquely or directly or from any other point of view, and the bed will
appear different, but there is no difference in reality. and the same of
all things.

yes, he said, the difference is only apparent.

now let me ask you another question: which

certainly.

and whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all
the arts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single thing
with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man--whoever tells us
this, i think that we can only imagine him to be a simple creature who
is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met, and
whom he thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to analyse
the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation.

most true.

and so, when we hear persons saying that the tragedians, and homer, who
is at their head, know all the arts and all things human, virtue as well
as vice, and divine things too, for that the good poet cannot compose
well unless he knows his subject, and that he who has not this knowledge
can never be a poet, we ought to consider whether here also there may
not be a similar illu

difficulty repressed in our own.

how very true!

and does not the same hold also of the ridiculous? there are jests which
you would be ashamed to make yourself, and yet on the comic stage, or
indeed in private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused by them,
and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness;--the case of pity
is repeated;--there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to
raise a laugh, and this which you once restrained by reason, because you
were afraid of being thought a buffoon, is now let out again; and
having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre, you are betrayed
unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet at home.

quite true, he said.

and the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections,
of desire and pain and pleasure, which are held to be inseparable
from every action--in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions
instead of drying them up; she lets them rule, although they ought to be
controlled, if mankind

and according to the report of the messenger from the other world this
was what the prophet said at the time: 'even for the last comer, if he
chooses wisely and will live diligently, there is appointed a happy and
not undesirable existence. let not him who chooses first be careless,
and let not the last despair.' and when he had spoken, he who had the
first choice came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny;
his mind having been darkened by folly and sensuality, he had not
thought out the whole matter before he chose, and did not at first
sight perceive that he was fated, among other evils, to devour his own
children. but when he had time to reflect, and saw what was in the lot,
he began to beat his breast and lament over his choice, forgetting the
proclamation of the prophet; for, instead of throwing the blame of his
misfortune on himself, he accused chance and the gods, and everything
rather than himself. now he was one of those who came from heaven, and
