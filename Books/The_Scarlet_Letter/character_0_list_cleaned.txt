[CHARACTER] - 
                 hester
is the book's protagonist and the wearer of the scarlet letter that
gives the book its title. the letter, a patch of fabric in the shape
of an "a," signifies that hester is an "adulterer." as a young woman,
hester married an elderly scholar, chillingworth, who sent her ahead
to america to live but never followed her. while waiting for him,
she had an affair with a puritan minister named dimmesdale, after
which she gave birth to pearl. hester is passionate but also strong--she endures
years of shame and scorn. she equals both her husband and her lover
in her intelligence and thoughtfulness. her alienation puts her
in the position to make acute observations about her community, particularly
about its treatment of women.
