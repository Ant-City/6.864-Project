[CHARACTER] - 
                the
younger brother of okonkwo's mother. [CHARACTER] receives okonkwo and
his family warmly when they travel to mbanta, and he advises okonkwo
to be grateful for the comfort that his motherland offers him lest
he anger the dead--especially his mother, who is buried there. [CHARACTER]
himself has suffered--all but one of his six wives are dead and he
has buried twenty-two children. he is a peaceful, compromising man
and functions as a foil (a character whose emotions or actions highlight,
by means of contrast, the emotions or actions of another character)
to okonkwo, who acts impetuously and without thinking.
