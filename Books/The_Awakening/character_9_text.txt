less it was the mocking-bird that hung on the other
side of the door, whistling his fluty notes out upon the breeze with
maddening persistence.

mr. pontellier, unable to read his newspaper with any degree of comfort,
arose with an expression and an exclamation of disgust.

he walked down the gallery and across the narrow “bridges” which
connected the lebrun cottages one with the other. he had been seated
before the door of the main house. the parrot and the mockingbird were
the property of madame lebrun, and they had the right to make all the
noise they wished. mr. pontellier had the privilege of quitting their
society when they ceased to be entertaining.

he stopped before the door of his own cottage, which was the fourth one
from the main building and next to the last. seating himself in a wicker
rocker which was there, he once more applied himself to the task of
reading the newspaper. the day was sunday; the paper was a day old. the
sunday papers had not yet reached grand isle. he was alrea

and rather slender build; he stooped a little. his hair was brown and
straight, parted on one side. his beard was neatly and closely trimmed.

once in a while he withdrew his glance from the newspaper and looked
about him. there was more noise than ever over at the house. the main
building was called “the house,” to distinguish it from the cottages.
the chattering and whistling birds were still at it. two young girls,
the farival twins, were playing a duet from “zampa” upon the piano.
madame lebrun was bustling in and out, giving orders in a high key to a
yard-boy whenever she got inside the house, and directions in an equally
high voice to a dining-room servant whenever she got outside. she was
a fresh, pretty woman, clad always in white with elbow sleeves. her
starched skirts crinkled as she came and went. farther down, before
one of the cottages, a lady in black was walking demurely up and down,
telling her beads. a good many persons of the pension had gone over to

new orleans, where an equal familiarity with english, french and spanish
gave him no small value as a clerk and correspondent.

he was spending his summer vacation, as he always did, with his mother
at grand isle. in former times, before robert could remember, “the
house” had been a summer luxury of the lebruns. now, flanked by its
dozen or more cottages, which were always filled with exclusive visitors
from the “quartier francais,” it enabled madame lebrun to maintain the
easy and comfortable existence which appeared to be her birthright.

mrs. pontellier talked about her father’s mississippi plantation and her
girlhood home in the old kentucky bluegrass country. she was an american
woman, with a small infusion of french which seemed to have been lost in
dilution. she read a letter from her sister, who was away in the east,
and who had engaged herself to be married. robert was interested, and
wanted to know what manner of girls the sisters were

robert scanned the distance for any such apparition. they would
doubtless remain away till the dinner hour. the young man ascended to
his mother’s room. it was situated at the top of the house, made up of
odd angles and a queer, sloping ceiling. two broad dormer windows looked
out toward the gulf, and as far across it as a man’s eye might reach.
the furnishings of the room were light, cool, and practical.

madame lebrun was busily engaged at the sewing-machine. a little black
girl sat on the floor, and with her hands worked the treadle of the
machine. the creole woman does not take any chances which may be avoided
of imperiling her health.

robert went over and seated himself on the broad sill of one of the
dormer windows. he took a book from his pocket and began energetically
to read it, judging by the precision and frequency with which he turned
the leaves. the sewing-machine made a resounding clatter in the

“where is victor going with the rockaway?”

“the rockaway? victor?”

“yes; down there in front. he seems to be getting ready to drive away
somewhere.”

“call him.” clatter, clatter!

robert uttered a shrill, piercing whistle which might have been heard
back at the wharf.

“he won’t look up.”

madame lebrun flew to the window. she called “victor!” she waved a
handkerchief and called again. the young fellow below got into the
vehicle and started the horse off at a gallop.

madame lebrun went back to the machine, crimson with annoyance. victor
was the younger son and brother--a tete montee, with a temper which
invited violence and a will which no ax could break.

“whenever you say the word i’m ready to thrash any amount of reason into
him that he’s able to hold.”

“if your father had o

bang! it was a fixed belief with madame lebrun that the conduct of the
universe and all things pertaining thereto would have been manifestly of
a more intelligent and higher order had not monsieur lebrun been removed
to other spheres during the early years of their married life.

“what do you hear from montel?” montel was a middle-aged gentleman whose
vain ambition and desire for the past twenty years had been to fill
the void which monsieur lebrun’s taking off had left in the lebrun
household. clatter, clatter, bang, clatter!

the windows, and which puffed, floated, and flapped at the capricious
will of a stiff breeze that swept up from the gulf.

it was saturday night a few weeks after the intimate conversation held
between robert and madame ratignolle on their way from the beach. an
unusual number of husbands, fathers, and friends had come down to stay
over sunday; and they were being suitably entertained by their families,
with the material help of madame lebrun. the dining tables had all been
removed to one end of the hall, and the chairs ranged about in rows and
in clusters. each little family group had had its say and exchanged
its domestic gossip earlier in the evening. there was now an apparent
disposition to relax; to widen the circle of confidences and give a more
general tone to the conversation.

many of the children had been permitted to sit up beyond their usual
bedtime. a small band of them were lying on their stomachs on the floor

“you were not so very far, my dear; i was watching you,” he told her.

edna went at once to the bath-house, and she had put on her dry clothes
and was ready to return home before the others had left the water. she
started to walk away alone. they all called to her and shouted to her.
she waved a dissenting hand, and went on, paying no further heed to
their renewed cries which sought to detain her.

“sometimes i am tempted to think that mrs. pontellier is capricious,”
 said madame lebrun, who was amusing herself immensely and feared that
edna’s abrupt departure might put an end to the pleasure.

“i know she is,” assented mr. pontellier; “sometimes, not often.”

edna had not traversed a quarter of the distance on her way home before
she was overtaken by robert.

“did you think i was afraid?” she asked him, without a shade of
annoyance.

“no; i knew you weren’t afraid.”

“then why did you come? why didn’t you stay out there with the others?”

pregnant with the first-felt throbbings of desire.

when the voices of the bathers were heard approaching, robert said
good-night. she did not answer him. he thought she was asleep. again
she watched his figure pass in and out of the strips of moonlight as he
walked away.

“what are you doing out here, edna? i thought i should find you in bed,”
 said her husband, when he discovered her lying there. he had walked up
with madame lebrun and left her at the house. his wife did not reply.

“are you asleep?” he asked, bending down close to look at her.

“no.” her eyes gleamed bright and intense, with no sleepy shadows, as
they looked into his.

“do you know it is past one o’clock? come on,” and he mounted the steps
and went into their room.

“edna!” called mr. pontellier from within, after a few moments had gone
by.

“don’t wait for me,” she answered. he thrust his head through the door.

 lovers, who had laid their plans the night before, were
already strolling toward the wharf. the lady in black, with her sunday
prayer-book, velvet and gold-clasped, and her sunday silver beads, was
following them at no great distance. old monsieur farival was up, and
was more than half inclined to do anything that suggested itself. he
put on his big straw hat, and taking his umbrella from the stand in the
hall, followed the lady in black, never overtaking her.

the little negro girl who worked madame lebrun’s sewing-machine was
sweeping the galleries with long, absent-minded strokes of the broom.
edna sent her up into the house to awaken robert.

“tell him i am going to the cheniere. the boat is ready; tell him to
hurry.”

he had soon joined her. she had never sent for him before. she had never
asked for him. she had never seemed to want him before. she did not
appear conscious that she had done anything unusual in commanding
his presence. he was apparently equally unconscious of anything

“do you know we have been together the whole livelong day, robert--since
early this morning?” she said at parting.

“all but the hundred years when you were sleeping. goodnight.”

he pressed her hand and went away in the direction of the beach. he did
not join any of the others, but walked alone toward the gulf.

edna stayed outside, awaiting her husband’s return. she had no desire
to sleep or to retire; nor did she feel like going over to sit with the
ratignolles, or to join madame lebrun and a group whose animated voices
reached her as they sat in conversation before the house. she let her
mind wander back over her stay at grand isle; and she tried to discover
wherein this summer had been different from any and every other summer
of her life. she could only realize that she herself--her present
self--was in some way different from the other self. that she was seeing
with different eyes and making the acquaintance of new conditions
in herself that colored and changed her environ

hat robert was going to mexico. she laid her spoon down
and looked about her bewildered. he had been with her, reading to her
all the morning, and had never even mentioned such a place as mexico.
she had not seen him during the afternoon; she had heard some one say he
was at the house, upstairs with his mother. this she had thought nothing
of, though she was surprised when he did not join her later in the
afternoon, when she went down to the beach.

she looked across at him, where he sat beside madame lebrun, who
presided. edna’s face was a blank picture of bewilderment, which she
never thought of disguising. he lifted his eyebrows with the pretext
of a smile as he returned her glance. he looked embarrassed and uneasy.
“when is he going?” she asked of everybody in general, as if robert were
not there to answer for himself.

“to-night!” “this very evening!” “did you ever!” “what possesses him!”
 were some of the replies she gathered, uttered simultaneously in french
and english

.

“impossible!” she exclaimed. “how can a person start off from grand isle
to mexico at a moment’s notice, as if he were going over to klein’s or
to the wharf or down to the beach?”

“i said all along i was going to mexico; i’ve been saying so for years!”
 cried robert, in an excited and irritable tone, with the air of a man
defending himself against a swarm of stinging insects.

madame lebrun knocked on the table with her knife handle.

“please let robert explain why he is going, and why he is going
to-night,” she called out. “really, this table is getting to be more and
more like bedlam every day, with everybody talking at once. sometimes--i
hope god will forgive me--but positively, sometimes i wish victor would
lose the power of speech.”

victor laughed sardonically as he thanked his mother for her holy wish,
of which he failed to see the benefit to anybody, except that it

afford her a more ample opportunity and license to talk herself.

monsieur farival thought that victor should have been taken out in
mid-ocean in his earliest youth and drowned. victor thought there would
be more logic in thus disposing of old people with an established claim
for making themselves universally obnoxious. madame lebrun grew a trifle
hysterical; robert called his brother some sharp, hard names.

“there’s nothing much to explain, mother,” he said; though he explained,
nevertheless--looking chiefly at edna--that he could only meet the
gentleman whom he intended to join at vera cruz by taking such and such
a steamer, which left new orleans on such a day; that beaudelet was
going out with his lugger-load of vegetables that night, which gave him
an opportunity of reaching the city and making his vessel in tim

 quadroon in getting the boys to bed.

they were very playful and inclined to talk--to do anything but lie
quiet and go to sleep. edna sent the quadroon away to her supper and
told her she need not return. then she sat and told the children
a story. instead of soothing it excited them, and added to their
wakefulness. she left them in heated argument, speculating about
the conclusion of the tale which their mother promised to finish the
following night.

the little black girl came in to say that madame lebrun would like to
have mrs. pontellier go and sit with them over at the house till mr.
robert went away. edna returned answer that she had already undressed,
that she did not feel quite well, but perhaps she would go over to the
house later. she started to dress again, and got as far advanced as to
remove her peignoir. but changing her mind once more she resumed
the peignoir, and went outside and sat down before her door. she was
overheated and irritable, and fanned herself energetically for a whil

any of the others; those lebruns are all given to heroics. but i must
say i should never have expected such a thing from robert. are you not
coming down? come on, dear; it doesn’t look friendly.”

“no,” said edna, a little sullenly. “i can’t go to the trouble of
dressing again; i don’t feel like it.”

“you needn’t dress; you look all right; fasten a belt around your waist.
just look at me!”

“no,” persisted edna; “but you go on. madame lebrun might be offended if
we both stayed away.”

madame ratignolle kissed edna good-night, and went away, being in truth
rather desirous of joining in the general and animated conversation
which was still in progress concerning mexico and the mexicans.

somewhat later robert came up, carrying his hand-bag.

“aren’t you feeling well?” he asked.

“oh, well enough. are you going right away?”

he lit a match and looked at his watch. “in twenty minutes,” he said.

as dulled, like a faded garment which seems to
be no longer worth wearing. she sought him everywhere--in others whom
she induced to talk about him. she went up in the mornings to madame
lebrun’s room, braving the clatter of the old sewing-machine. she sat
there and chatted at intervals as robert had done. she gazed around
the room at the pictures and photographs hanging upon the wall, and
discovered in some corner an old family album, which she examined with
the keenest interest, appealing to madame lebrun for enlightenment
concerning the many figures and faces which she discovered between its
pages.

there was a picture of madame lebrun with robert as a baby, seated in
her lap, a round-faced infant with a fist in his mouth. the eyes alone
in the baby suggested the man. and that was he also in kilts, at the age
of five, wearing long curls and holding a whip in his hand. it made edna
laugh, and she laughed, too, at the portrait in his first long trousers;
while another interested her, taken when h

e left for college, looking
thin, long-faced, with eyes full of fire, ambition and great intentions.
but there was no recent picture, none which suggested the robert who had
gone away five days ago, leaving a void and wilderness behind him.

“oh, robert stopped having his pictures taken when he had to pay for
them himself! he found wiser use for his money, he says,” explained
madame lebrun. she had a letter from him, written before he left new
orleans. edna wished to see the letter, and madame lebrun told her to
look for it either on the table or the dresser, or perhaps it was on the
mantelpiece.

the letter was on the bookshelf. it possessed the greatest interest and
attraction for edna; the envelope, its size and shape, the post-mark,
the handwriting. she examined every detail of the outside before opening
it. there were only a few lines, setting forth that he would leave the
city that afternoon, that he had packed his trunk in good shape, that
he was well, and sent her his love and begge

while others attributed it to the natural aversion for water sometimes
believed to accompany the artistic temperament. mademoiselle offered
edna some chocolates in a paper bag, which she took from her pocket,
by way of showing that she bore no ill feeling. she habitually ate
chocolates for their sustaining quality; they contained much nutriment
in small compass, she said. they saved her from starvation, as madame
lebrun’s table was utterly impossible; and no one save so impertinent a
woman as madame lebrun could think of offering such food to people and
requiring them to pay for it.

“she must feel very lonely without her son,” said edna, desiring to
change the subject. “her favorite son, too. it must have been quite hard
to let him go.”

mademoiselle laughed maliciously.

“her favorite son! oh, dear! who could have been imposing such a tale
upon you? aline lebrun lives for victor, and for victor alone. she has
spoiled him into the worthless creature he is. she worships him and the

ner. in truth, he did not want to know her
at all, or anything concerning her--the most disagreeable and unpopular
woman who ever lived in bienville street. he thanked heaven she had left
the neighborhood, and was equally thankful that he did not know where
she had gone.

edna’s desire to see mademoiselle reisz had increased tenfold since
these unlooked-for obstacles had arisen to thwart it. she was wondering
who could give her the information she sought, when it suddenly occurred
to her that madame lebrun would be the one most likely to do so. she
knew it was useless to ask madame ratignolle, who was on the most
distant terms with the musician, and preferred to know nothing
concerning her. she had once been almost as emphatic in expressing
herself upon the subject as the corner grocer.

edna knew that madame lebrun had returned to the city, for it was
the middle of november. and she also knew where the lebruns lived, on
chartres street.

their home from the outside looked like a prison, with iro

els. before she saw them edna
could hear them in altercation, the woman--plainly an anomaly--claiming
the right to be allowed to perform her duties, one of which was to
answer the bell.

victor was surprised and delighted to see mrs. pontellier, and he made
no attempt to conceal either his astonishment or his delight. he was a
dark-browed, good-looking youngster of nineteen, greatly resembling
his mother, but with ten times her impetuosity. he instructed the
black woman to go at once and inform madame lebrun that mrs. pontellier
desired to see her. the woman grumbled a refusal to do part of her duty
when she had not been permitted to do it all, and started back to her
interrupted task of weeding the garden. whereupon victor administered
a rebuke in the form of a volley of abuse, which, owing to its rapidity
and incoherence, was all but incomprehensible to edna. whatever it
was, the rebuke was convincing, for the woman dropped her hoe and went
mumbling into the house.

edna did not wish to enter. it

the shutters as he passed by. oh! but she was a beauty! certainly he
smiled back, and went up and talked to her. mrs. pontellier did not know
him if she supposed he was one to let an opportunity like that escape
him. despite herself, the youngster amused her. she must have betrayed
in her look some degree of interest or entertainment. the boy grew more
daring, and mrs. pontellier might have found herself, in a little while,
listening to a highly colored story but for the timely appearance of
madame lebrun.

that lady was still clad in white, according to her custom of the
summer. her eyes beamed an effusive welcome. would not mrs. pontellier
go inside? would she partake of some refreshment? why had she not been
there before? how was that dear mr. pontellier and how were those sweet
children? had mrs. pontellier ever known such a warm november?

victor went and reclined on the wicker lounge behind his mother’s chair,
where he commanded a view of edna’s face. he had taken her parasol from

hands while he spoke to her, and he now lifted it and twirled it
above him as he lay on his back. when madame lebrun complained that it
was so dull coming back to the city; that she saw so few people now;
that even victor, when he came up from the island for a day or two, had
so much to occupy him and engage his time; then it was that the youth
went into contortions on the lounge and winked mischievously at edna.
she somehow felt like a confederate in crime, and tried to look severe
and disapproving.

there had been but two letters from robert, with little in them, they

their habits, the conditions of life which he found there. he sent his
love to the family. he inclosed a check to his mother, and hoped she
would affectionately remember him to all his friends. that was about the
substance of the two letters. edna felt that if there had been a message
for her, she would have received it. the despondent frame of mind in
which she had left home began again to overtake her, and she remembered
that she wished to find mademoiselle reisz.

madame lebrun knew where mademoiselle reisz lived. she gave edna the
address, regretting that she would not consent to stay and spend the
remainder of the afternoon, and pay a visit to mademoiselle reisz some
other day. the afternoon was already well advanced.

victor escorted her out upon the banquette, lifted her parasol, and held
it over her while he walked to the car with her. he entreated her
to bear in mind that the disclosures of the afternoon were strictly
confidential. she laughed and bantered him a

 little, remembering too
late that she should have been dignified and reserved.

“how handsome mrs. pontellier looked!” said madame lebrun to her son.

“ravishing!” he admitted. “the city atmosphere has improved her. some
way she doesn’t seem like the same woman.”

some people contended that the reason mademoiselle reisz always chose
apartments up under the roof was to discourage the approach of beggars,
peddlars and callers. there were plenty of windows in her little front
room. they were for the most part dingy, but as they were nearly always
open it did not make so much difference. they often admitted into th

“i don’t know whether i like you or not,” replied edna, gazing down at
the little woman with a quizzical look.

the candor of mrs. pontellier’s admission greatly pleased mademoiselle
reisz. she expressed her gratification by repairing forthwith to the
region of the gasoline stove and rewarding her guest with the promised
cup of coffee. the coffee and the biscuit accompanying it proved very
acceptable to edna, who had declined refreshment at madame lebrun’s and
was now beginning to feel hungry. mademoiselle set the tray which she
brought in upon a small table near at hand, and seated herself once
again on the lumpy sofa.

“i have had a letter from your friend,” she remarked, as she poured a
little cream into edna’s cup and handed it to her.

“my friend?”

“yes, your friend robert. he wrote to me from the city of mexico.”

“wrote to you?” repeated edna in amazement, stirring her coffee
absently.

“yes, to me. why not? don’

 and regretted that she could not
accompany them. arobin appeared nonplused, and asked edna if there were
any one else she cared to ask.

she did not deem it worth while to go in search of any of the
fashionable acquaintances from whom she had withdrawn herself. she
thought of madame ratignolle, but knew that her fair friend did not
leave the house, except to take a languid walk around the block with her
husband after nightfall. mademoiselle reisz would have laughed at such a
request from edna. madame lebrun might have enjoyed the outing, but for
some reason edna did not want her. so they went alone, she and arobin.

the afternoon was intensely interesting to her. the excitement came
back upon her like a remittent fever. her talk grew familiar and
confidential. it was no labor to become intimate with arobin. his manner
invited easy confidence. the preliminary stage of becoming acquainted
was one which he always endeavored to ignore when a pretty and engaging
woman was concerned.

though edna had spoken of the dinner as a very grand affair, it was
in truth a very small affair and very select, in so much as the guests
invited were few and were selected with discrimination. she had counted
upon an even dozen seating themselves at her round mahogany board,
forgetting for the moment that madame ratignolle was to the last degree
souffrante and unpresentable, and not foreseeing that madame lebrun
would send a thousand regrets at the last moment. so there were only
ten, after all, which made a cozy, comfortable number.

there were mr. and mrs. merriman, a pretty, vivacious little woman in
the thirties; her husband, a jovial fellow, something of a shallow-pate,
who laughed a good deal at other people’s witticisms, and had thereby
made himself extremely popular. mrs. highcamp had accompanied them. of
course, there was alcee arobin; and mademoiselle reisz had consented
to come. edna had s

ossibly she might, and he negotiated with her for some
parisian studies to reach him in time for the holiday trade in december.

robert did not come that day. she was keenly disappointed. he did not
come the following day, nor the next. each morning she awoke with hope,
and each night she was a prey to despondency. she was tempted to seek
him out. but far from yielding to the impulse, she avoided any occasion
which might throw her in his way. she did not go to mademoiselle reisz’s
nor pass by madame lebrun’s, as she might have done if he had still been
in mexico.

when arobin, one night, urged her to drive with him, she went--out to
the lake, on the shell road. his horses were full of mettle, and even a
little unmanageable. she liked the rapid gait at which they spun along,
and the quick, sharp sound of the horses’ hoofs on the hard road. they
did not stop anywhere to eat or to drink. arobin was not needlessly
imprudent. but they ate and they drank when they regained edna’s little
dining-ro
