allowing for my learned friendâ€™s appearance being careless and slovenly
if not debauched, they were sufficiently like each other to surprise,
not only the witness, but everybody present, when they were thus brought
into comparison. my lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside
his wig, and giving no very gracious consent, the likeness became
much more remarkable. my lord inquired of mr. stryver (the prisonerâ€™s
counsel), whether they were next to try mr. carton (name of my learned
friend) for treason? but, mr. stryver replied to my lord, no; but he
would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once, might
happen twice; whether he would have been so confident if he had seen
this illustration of his rashness sooner, whether he would be so
confident, having seen it; and more. the upshot of which, was, to smash
this witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his part of

how, nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous
character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the
state trials of this country were full. but, there my lord interposed
(with as grave a face as if it had not been true), saying that he could
not sit upon that bench and suffer those allusions.

mr. stryver then called his few witnesses, and mr. cruncher had next to
attend while mr. attorney-general turned the whole suit of clothes mr.
stryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how barsad and
cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the
prisoner a hundred times worse. lastly, came my lord himself, turning
the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole
decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.

 the jury turned to consider, and the great flies swarmed again.

mr. carton, who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court,
changed neither his place nor his attitude, even in this excitement.
while his learned friend, mr. stryver, massing his papers before him,
whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced
anxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and
grouped themselves anew; while even my lord himself arose from his seat,
and slowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicion
in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man
sat leaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put
on just as it had happened to light

iv. congratulatory


from the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the
human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when
doctor manette, lucie manette, his daughter, mr. lorry, the solicitor
for the defence, and its counsel, mr. stryver, stood gathered round mr.
charles darnay--just released--congratulating him on his escape from
death.

it would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise
in doctor manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the
shoemaker of the garret in paris. yet, no one could have looked at him
twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation
had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and
to the abstraction that overclouded him

his mind. she was the golden thread that united him to a past beyond his
misery, and to a present beyond his misery: and the sound of her voice,
the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial
influence with him almost always. not absolutely always, for she could
recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they were few
and slight, and she believed them over.

mr. darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had turned
to mr. stryver, whom he warmly thanked. mr. stryver, a man of little
more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout,
loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing
way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and
conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life.

he still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at his
late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent mr. lorry clean

another manâ€™s, i believe.â€

it clearly being incumbent on some one to say, â€œmuch better,â€ mr. lorry
said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested
object of squeezing himself back again.

â€œyou think so?â€ said mr. stryver. â€œwell! you have been present all day,
and you ought to know. you are a man of business, too.â€

â€œand as such,â€ quoth mr. lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had
now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered
him out of it--â€œas such i will appeal to doctor manette, to break up
this conference and order us all to our homes. miss lucie looks ill, mr.
darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.â€

walking between her father and mr. darnay, lucie manette passed into
the open air. a hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter
departed in it.

mr. stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back
to the robing-room. another person, who had not joined the group, or
interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning
against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled
out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. he now
stepped up to where mr. lorry and mr. darnay stood upon the pavement.

drier parts of the legal race.

a favourite at the old bailey, and eke at the sessions, mr. stryver had
begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which
he mounted. sessions and old bailey had now to summon their favourite,
specially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the
visage of the lord chief justice in the court of kingâ€™s bench, the
florid countenance of mr. stryver might be daily seen, bursting out of
the bed of wigs, like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from

among the most striking and necessary of the advocateâ€™s accomplishments.
but, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. the more

sydney carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was stryverâ€™s great
ally. what the two drank together, between hilary term and michaelmas,
might have floated a kingâ€™s ship. stryver never had a case in hand,
anywhere, but carton was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring
at the ceiling of the court; they went the same circuit, and even there
they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and carton was
rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily
to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat. at last, it began to get about,
among such as were interested in the matter, that although sydney carton
would never be a lion, he was an amaz

the stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone
home, and the stryver principal opened the door. he had his slippers on,
and a loose bed-gown, and his throat was bare for his greater ease. he
had that rather wild, strained, seared marking about the eyes, which
may be observed in all free livers of his class, from the portrait of
jeffries downward, and which can be traced, under various disguises of
art, through the portraits of every drinking age.

â€œi thought he was rather a handsome fellow, and i thought i should have
been much the same sort of fellow, if i had had any luck.â€

mr. stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch.

â€œyou and your luck, sydney! get to work, get to work.â€

sullenly enough, the jackal loosened his dress, went into an adjoining
room, and came back with a large jug of cold water, a basin, and a towel
or two. steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing them
out, he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold, sat down
at the table, and said, â€œnow i am ready!â€

thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll,
and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?â€

he studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with
ease, and was equably cheerful. to him, now entered charles darnay, at
sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.

â€œcharles darnay! i rejoice to see you. we have been counting on your

a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the doctor. â€œmiss

sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much

the towelling; and he was in a very damaged condition, as he now pulled
his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at
intervals for the last six hours.

be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows better how
to be agreeable, in a womanâ€™s society, than you do.â€

â€œno; but before i go on,â€ said stryver, shaking his head in his bullying
way, â€œiâ€™ll have this out with you. youâ€™ve been at doctor manetteâ€™s house

â€œit should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar, to
be ashamed of anything,â€ returned sydney; â€œyou ought to be much obliged

rejoinder at him; â€œno, sydney, itâ€™s my duty to tell you--and i tell you
to your face to do you good--that you are a devilish ill-conditioned
fellow in that sort of society. you are a disagreeable fellow.â€

sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made, and laughed.

myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in circumstances.

delivered in no very soothing tone.

â€œi have no business to be, at all, that i know of,â€ said sydney carton.

for the disclosure he was about to make, â€œbecause i know you donâ€™t mean

make this little preface, because you once mentioned the young lady to
me in slighting terms.â€

sydney carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers,
looking at his friend.

â€œnow you know all about it, syd,â€ said mr. stryver. â€œi donâ€™t care about

xii. the fellow of delicacy


mr. stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good
fortune on the doctorâ€™s daughter, resolved to make her happiness known
to her before he left town for the long vacation. after some mental

as to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but clearly
saw his way to the verdict. argued with the jury on substantial worldly
grounds--the only grounds ever worth taking into account--it was a
plain case, and had not a weak spot in it. he called himself for the
plaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for
the defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to
consider. after trying it, stryver, c. j., was satisfied that no plainer
case could be.

accordingly, mr. stryver inaugurated the long vacation with a formal
proposal to take miss manette to vauxhall gardens; that failing, to
ranelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him to present
himself in soho, and there declare his noble mind.

towards soho, therefore, mr. stryver shouldered his way from the temple,
while the bloom of the long vacationâ€™s infancy was still upon it.

stryverâ€™s mind to enter the bank, and reveal to mr. lorry the brightness
of the soho horizon. so, he pushed open the door with the weak rattle
in its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient
cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where mr.
lorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron
bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything
under the clouds were a sum.

â€œhalloa!â€ said mr. stryver. â€œhow do you do? i hope you are well!â€

it was stryverâ€™s grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any
place, or space. he was so much too big for tellsonâ€™s, that old clerks
in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he
squeezed them against the wall. the house itself, magnificently reading
the paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if
the stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.

of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at tellsonâ€™s who shook
hands with a customer when the house pervaded the air. he shook in a
self-abnegating way, as one who shook for tellson and co.

â€œcan i do anything for you, mr. stryver?â€ asked mr. lorry, in his
business character.

â€œwhy, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, mr. lorry; i
have come for a private word.â€

â€œoh indeed!â€ said mr. lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed
to the house afar off.

â€œi am going,â€ said mr. stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the
desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to
be not half desk enough for him: â€œi am going to make an offer of myself

â€œoh dear me!â€ cried mr. lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his
visitor dubiously.

â€œoh dear me, sir?â€ repeated stryver, drawing back. â€œoh dear you, sir?
what may your meaning be, mr. lorry?â€

â€œmy meaning,â€ answered the man of business, â€œis, of course, friendly and
appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short,
my meaning is everything you could desire. but--really, you know, mr.
stryver--â€ mr. lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest
manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally,
â€œyou know there really is so much too much of you!â€

â€œwell!â€ said stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand,
opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, â€œif i understand you,

mr. lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that
end, and bit the feather of a pen.

â€œoh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,â€ said mr. lorry.

â€œif you come to advancing you know,â€ said mr. lorry, delighted to be
able to make another admission, â€œnobody can doubt that.â€

â€œthen i think i wouldnâ€™t, if i was you.â€

â€œwhy?â€ said stryver. â€œnow, iâ€™ll put you in a corner,â€ forensically
shaking a forefinger at him. â€œyou are a man of business and bound to
have a reason. state your reason. why wouldnâ€™t you go?â€

â€œbecause,â€ said mr. lorry, â€œi wouldnâ€™t go on such an object without
having some cause to believe that i should succeed.â€

â€œd--n _me_!â€ cried stryver, â€œbut this beats everything.â€

mr. lorry glanced at the distant house, and glanced at the angry
stryver.

â€œhereâ€™s a man of business

complete success, he says thereâ€™s no reason at all! says it with his
head on!â€ mr. stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have
been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off.

â€œwhen i speak of success, i speak of success with the young lady; and
when i speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, i speak of
causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady. the young
lady, my good sir,â€ said mr. lorry, mildly tapping the stryver arm, â€œthe
young lady. the young lady goes before all.â€

â€œthen you mean to tell me,

elbows, â€œthat it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at
present in question is a mincing fool?â€

â€œnot exactly so. i mean to tell you, mr. stryver,â€ said mr. lorry,
reddening, â€œthat i will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady
from any lips; and that if i knew any man--which i hope i do not--whose
taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could
not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at
this desk, not even tellsonâ€™s should prevent my giving him a piece of my
mind.â€

the necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put mr. stryverâ€™s
blood-vessels into a d

mr. lorryâ€™s veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in
no better state now it was his turn.

â€œthat is what i mean to tell you, sir,â€ said mr. lorry. â€œpray let there
be no mistake about it.â€

mr. stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood
hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the
toothache. he broke the awkward silence by saying:

â€œthis is something new to me, mr. lorry. you deliberately advise me not
to go up to soho and offer myself--_my_self, stryver of the kingâ€™s bench
bar?â€

â€œdo you ask me for my advice, mr. stryver?â€

â€œvery good. then i give it, and you have repeated it correctly.â€

not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of

of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, i have

in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. itâ€™s
new to me, but you are right, i dare say.â€

â€œwhat i suppose, mr. stryver, i claim to characterise for myself--and

gentleman breathing.â€

â€œgranted. thank you. well, mr. stryver, i was about to say:--it might be

â€œhow long would you keep me in town?â€

â€œoh! it is only a question of a few hours. i could go to soho in the
evening, and come to your chambers afterwards.â€

â€œthen i say yes,â€ said stryver: â€œi wonâ€™t go up there now, i am not so
hot upon it as that comes to; i say yes, and i shall expect you to look
in to-night. good morning.â€

then mr. stryver turned and burst out of the bank, causing such a
concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it
bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength
of the two ancient clerks. those venerable and feeble persons were
always seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly

the empty office until they bowed another customer in.

the barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have
gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than
moral certainty. unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to
swallow, he got it down. â€œand now,â€ said mr. stryver, shaking his
forensic forefinger at the temple in general, when it was down, â€œmy way
out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.â€

it was a bit of the art of an old bailey tactician, in which he found
great relief. â€œyou shall not put me in the wrong, young lady,â€ said mr.
stryver; â€œiâ€™ll do that for you.â€

accordingly, when mr. lorry called that night as late as ten oâ€™clock,
mr. stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the
purpose, seemed to have

altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.

bootless attempts to bring him round to the question. â€œi have been to

â€œto soho?â€ repeated mr. stryver, coldly. â€œoh, to be sure! what am i

â€œand i have no doubt,â€ said mr. lorry, â€œthat i was right in the
conversation we had. my opinion is confirmed, and i reiterate my
advice.â€

â€œi assure you,â€ returned mr. stryver, in the friendliest way, â€œthat i
am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor fatherâ€™s
account. i know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let
us say no more about it.â€

â€œi dare say not,â€ rejoined stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing and
final way; â€œno matter, no matter.â€

â€œbut it does matter,â€ mr. lorry urged.

â€œno it doesnâ€™t; i assure you it doesnâ€™t. having supposed that there was
sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is
not a laudable ambition, i am well out of my mistake, and no harm is

and i am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you,
and for giving me your advice; you know the young lady better than i do;

mr. lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at mr.
stryver shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of
showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head.
â€œmake the best of it, my dear sir,â€ said stryver; â€œsay no more about it;
thank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!â€

mr. lorry was out in the night, before he knew where he was. mr. stryver
was lying back on his sofa, winking at his ceiling.
