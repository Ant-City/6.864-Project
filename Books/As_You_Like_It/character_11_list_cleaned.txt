[CHARACTER] - 
                	a
professional wrestler in duke frederick's court. [CHARACTER] demonstrates
both his caring nature and his political savvy when he asks oliver
to intercede in his upcoming fight with orlando: he does not want
to injure the young man and thereby lose favor among the nobles
who support him. [CHARACTER]'s concern for orlando proves unwarranted
when orlando beats 
him senseless.
