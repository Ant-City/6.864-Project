the 
house 
on 
mango 
street 

we  didn't always  live  on  mango street.  before  that 
we lived on loomis on the third floor, and before that we 
lived on keeler.  before keeler it was  paulina, and before 
that i can't remember. but what i remember most is mov­
ing a lot.  each  time it seemed there'd be one more of us. 
by  the time we  got to mango street we  were six-mama, 
papa, carlos,  kiki,  my  sister nenny and me. 

the house on mango street is ours, and we don't have 
to pay rent to anybody, or share the yard with the people 
downstairs, or be careful not to make too much noise, and 
there isn't a landlord banging on the ceiling with a broom. 
but even so,  it's not the house we'd  thought we'd  get.

is so swollen you have to push hard to get in. there is  no 
front yard, only four little elms the city planted by the curb. 
out  back  is  a  small  garage  for  the  car we  don't  own  yet 
and a small yard that looks smaller between the two build­
ings  on  either  side.  there  are  stairs  in  our  house,  but 
they're ordinary hallway stairs, and the house has only one 
washroom. everybody has to share a bedroom-mama and 
papa, carlos and kiki,  me and nenny. 

once when we were living on loomis, a nun from my 
school passed by and saw  me playing out front.  the laun­

hairs 

everybody in our family has different hair. my papa's 
hair is  like a broom, all  up in  the air. and me,  my  hair is 
lazy. it never obeys barrettes or bands. carlos' hair is  thick 
and straight.  he doesn't need  to comb it.  nenny's hair is 
slippery-slides out of your  hand.  and  kiki,  who  is  the 
youngest,  has  hair like fur. 

but  my  mother's  hair,  my  mother's  hair,  like  little \ 

rosettes, like little candy circles all curly and pretty because 
she  pinned  it  in  pincurls  all  day,  sweet  to  put your  nose

boys  &  girls 

the  boys  and  the  girls  live  in  separate worlds.  the 
boys  in  their  universe  and  we  in  ours.  my  brothers  for 
example. they've got plenty to say to me and nenny inside 
the house.  but outside  they can't be  seen  talking to girls. 
carlos and kiki are each other's best friend ... not ours. 
nenny  is  too  young  to  be  my  friend.  she's just  my 
sister and that was not my fault. you don't pick your sisters, 
you just get them and sometimes they come like  nenny. 

she can't  play  with  those  vargas  kids  or she'll  turn 
out just like them. and since she comes right after me, she 
is my  responsibility.

dirty window for light. he doesn't turn the lights on unless

there are a million zillion kinds, says nenny. no two 
exactly  alike.  only  how  do  you  remember  which  one  is

say making it up as  i go.  you gotta know how to walk with 
hips,  practice you  know-like if half of you  wanted to go 
one way  and the other half the other.
