rom his present point of view, there was a halo of happiness about each of their heads, and he would have sacrificed all the brass buttons on the continent to have been enabled to return to them. he told himself that he was not formed for a soldier. and he mused seriously upon the radical differences between himself and those men who were dodging implike around the fires.

as he mused thus he heard the rustle of grass, and, upon turning his head, discovered the loud soldier. he called out, "oh, wilson!"

the latter approached and looked down. "why, hello, henry; is it you? what are you doing here?"

"oh, thinking," said the youth.

the other sat down and carefully lighted his pipe. "you're getting blue my boy. you're looking thundering peek-ed. what the dickens is wrong with you?"

"oh, nothing," said the youth.

the loud soldier launched then into the subject of the anticipated fight. "oh, we've got 'em now!" as he spoke his boyish face was wreathed in a gleeful smile, and his voice had an

cost.

he swung unsteadily toward the fire. he could see the forms of men throwing black shadows in the red light, and as he went nearer it became known to him in some way that the ground was strewn with sleeping men.

of a sudden he confronted a black and monstrous figure. a rifle barrel caught some glinting beams. "halt! halt!" he was dismayed for a moment, but he presently thought that he recognized the nervous voice. as he stood tottering before the rifle barrel, he called out: "why, hello, wilson, you--you here?"

the rifle was lowered to a position of caution and the loud soldier came slowly forward. he peered into the youth's face. "that you, henry?"

"yes, it's--it's me."

"well, well, ol' boy," said the other, "by ginger, i'm glad t' see yeh! i give yeh up fer a goner. i thought yeh was dead sure enough." there was husky emotion in his voice.

the youth found that now he could barely stand upon his feet. there was a sudden sinking of his forces. he thought he must hasten to produce

his friend had stepped forward quickly. "what? got shot? why didn't yeh say so first? poor ol' boy, we must--hol' on a minnit; what am i doin'. i'll call simpson."

another figure at that moment loomed in the gloom. they could see that it was the corporal. "who yeh talkin' to, wilson?" he demanded. his voice was anger-toned. "who yeh talkin' to? yeh th' derndest sentinel--why--hello, henry, you here? why, i thought you was dead four hours ago! great jerusalem, they keep turnin' up every ten minutes or so! we thought we'd lost forty-two men by straight count, but if they keep on a-comin' this way, we'll git th' comp'ny all back by mornin' yit. where was yeh?"

"over on th' right. i got separated"--began the youth with considerable glibness.

but his friend had interrupted ha

the corporal went away. the youth remained on the ground like a parcel. he stared with a vacant look into the fire.

after a time he aroused, for some part, and the things about him began to take form. he saw that the ground in the deep shadows was cluttered with men, sprawling in every conceivable posture. glancing narrowly into the more distant darkness, he caught occasional glimpses of visages that loomed pallid and ghostly, lit with a phosphorescent glow. these faces

"so?" said the youth.




chapter 15

the regiment was standing at order arms at the side of a lane, waiting for the command to march, when suddenly the youth remembered the little packet enwrapped in a faded yellow envelope which the loud young soldier with lugubrious words had intrusted to him. it made him start. he uttered an exclamation and turned toward his comrade.

"wilson!"

"what?"

his friend, at his side in the ranks, was thoughtfully staring down the road. from some cause his expression was at that moment very meek. the youth, regarding him with sidelong glances, felt impelled to change his purpose. "oh, nothing," he said.

his friend turned his head in some surprise, "why, what was yeh goin' t' say?"

"oh, nothing," repeated the youth.

he resolved not to deal the little blow. it was sufficient that the fact made him glad. it was not necessary to knock his

als. as for himself, he had fled with discretion and dignity.

he was aroused from this reverie by his friend, who, having hitched about nervously and blinked at the trees for a time, suddenly coughed in an introductory way, and spoke.

"fleming!"

"what?"

the friend put his hand up to his mouth and coughed again. he fidgeted in his jacket.

"well," he gulped at last, "i guess yeh might as well give me back them letters." dark, prickling blood had flushed into his cheeks and brow.

"all right, wilson," said the youth. he loosened two buttons of his coat, thrust in his hand, and brought forth the packet. as he extended it to his friend the latter's face was turned from him.

he had been slow in the act of producing the packet because during it he had been trying to invent a remarkable comment on the affair. he could conjure up nothing of sufficient point. he was compelled to allow his friend to escape unmolested with his packet. and for this he took unto himself considerable credit. it was a

the youth felt that in them he had been made aged. new eyes were given to him. and the most startling thing was to learn suddenly that he was very insignificant. the officer spoke of the regiment as if he referred to a broom. some part of the woods needed sweeping, perhaps, and he merely indicated a broom in a tone properly indifferent to its fate. it was war, no doubt, but it appeared strange.

as the two boys approached the line, the lieutenant perceived them and swelled with wrath. "fleming--wilson--how long does it take yeh to git water, anyhow--where yeh been to."

but his oration ceased as he saw their eyes, which were large with great tales. "we're goin' t' charge--we're goin' t' charge!" cried the youth's friend, hastening with his news.

"charge?" said the lieutenant. "charge? well, b'gawd! now, this is real fightin'." over his soiled countenance there went a boastful smile. "charge? well, b'gawd!"

a little group of soldiers surrounded the two youths. "are we, sure 'nough? well, i'

ll be derned! charge? what fer? what at? wilson, you're lyin'."

"i hope to die," said the youth, pitching his tones to the key of angry remonstrance. "sure as shooting, i tell you."

and his friend spoke in re-enforcement. "not by a blame sight, he ain't lyin'. we heard 'em talkin'."

they caught sight of two mounted figures a short distance from them. one was the colonel of the regiment and the other was the officer who had received orders from the commander of the division. they were gesticulating at each other. the soldier, pointing at t
