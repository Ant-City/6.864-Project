hich annihilate each other in great haste, to keep the energy from changing, on average.
4. even though the initial equation that schrödinger wrote down—the one incorporating special
relativity—did not accurately describe the quantum-mechanical properties of electrons in hydrogen
atoms, it was soon realized to be a valuable equation when appropriately used in other contexts, and,
in fact, is still in use today. however, by the time schrödinger published his equation he had been
scooped by oskar klein and walter gordon, and hence his relativistic equation is called the "klein-
gordon equation."

7. the size of the planck length can be understood based upon simple reasoning rooted in what
physicists call dimensional analysis. the idea is this. when a theory is formulated as a collection of
equations, the abstract symbols must be tied to physical features of the world if the theory is to make
contact with reality. in particular, we must introduce a system of units so that if a symbol, say, is
m
