"when did you see harvey stone?"
"at the crillon. harvey was just a little daunted. hadn't eaten for three days. doesn't eat any more. just goes

"he's all right."
"splendid. wish he wouldn't keep going off like a cat, though. makes me nervous."
"what'll we do to-night?"
"doesn't make any difference. only let's not get daunted. suppose they got any hard-boiled eggs here? if they
