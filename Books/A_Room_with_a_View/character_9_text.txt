see where santa croce was.

â€œtut, tut! miss lucy! i hope we shall soon emancipate you from baedeker.
he does but touch the surface of things. as to the true italy--he does
not even dream of it. the true italy is only to be found by patient
observation.â€

this sounded very interesting, and lucy hurried over her breakfast, and
started with her new friend in high spirits. italy was coming at last.
the cockney signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream.

miss lavish--for that was the clever ladyâ€™s name--turned to the right
along the sunny lungâ€™ arno. how delightfully warm! but a wind down
the side streets cut like a knife, didnâ€™t it? ponte alle
grazie--particularly interesting, mentioned by dante. san
miniato--beautiful as well as interesting; the crucifix that kissed
a murderer--miss honeychurch would remember the story. the men on the
river were fishing. (untrue; but then, so is most information.) then
miss lavish darted under the archway of

 the white bullocks, and she
stopped, and she cried:

â€œa smell! a true florentine smell! every city, let me teach you, has its
own smell.â€

â€œis it a very nice smell?â€ said lucy, who had inherited from her mother
a distaste to dirt.

â€œone doesnâ€™t come to italy for niceness,â€ was the retort; â€œone comes for
life. buon giorno! buon giorno!â€ bowing right and left. â€œlook at that
adorable wine-cart! how the driver stares at us, dear, simple soul!â€

so miss lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of florence,
short, fidgety, and playful as a kitten, though without a kittenâ€™s
grace. it was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so
cheerful; and a blue military cloak, such as an italian officer wears,
only increased the sense of festivity.

â€œbuon giorno! take the word of an old woman, miss lucy: you will
never repent of a little civility to your inferiors. that is the
true democracy. though i am a real radical as well. t

â€œoh, please--! if my father was alive, i am sure he would vote radical
again now that ireland is all right. and as it is, the glass over our
front door was broken last election, and freddy is sure it was the

â€œshameful! a manufacturing district, i suppose?â€

â€œno--in the surrey hills. about five miles from dorking, looking over
the weald.â€

miss lavish seemed interested, and slackened her trot.

â€œwhat a delightful part; i know it so well. it is full of the very
nicest people. do you know sir harry otway--a radical if ever there
was?â€

â€œvery well indeed.â€

â€œand old mrs. butterworth the philanthropist?â€

â€œwhy, she rents a field of us! how funny!â€

miss lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky, and murmured: â€œoh, you
have property in surrey?â€

â€œhardly any,â€ said lucy, fearful of being thought a snob. â€œon

miss lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her
auntâ€™s suffolk estate. italy receded. they tried to remember the last
name of lady louisa someone, who had taken a house near summer street
the other year, but she had not liked it, which was odd of her. and just
as miss lavish had got the name, she broke off and exclaimed:

â€œbless us! bless us and save us! weâ€™ve lost the way.â€

certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching santa croce, the tower
of which had been plainly visible from the landing window. but miss
lavish had said so much about knowing her florence by heart, that lucy
had followed her with no misgivings.

â€œlost! lost! my dear miss lucy, during our political diatribes we have
taken a wrong turning. how those horrid conservatives wou

 abounds. lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of lady
louisa, and became discontented herself. for one ravishing moment italy
appeared. she stood in the square of the annunziata and saw in the
living terra-cotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can
ever stale. there they stood, with their shining limbs bursting from
the garments of charity, and their strong white arms extended against
circlets of heaven. lucy thought she had never seen anything more
beautiful; but miss lavish, with a shriek of dismay, dragged her
forward, declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a
mile.

the hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins, or
rather ceases, to tell, and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste
out of a little shop, because it looked so typical. it tasted partly
of the paper in which it was wrapped, partly of hair oil, partly of the
great unknown. but it gave them strength to drift into another piazza,
large and dusty, on th

e farther side of which rose a black-and-white
facade of surpassing ugliness. miss lavish spoke to it dramatically. it
was santa croce. the adventure was over.

â€œstop a minute; let those two people go on, or i shall have to speak to
them. i do detest conventional intercourse. nasty! they are going into
the church, too. oh, the britisher abroad!â€

â€œwe sat opposite them at dinner last night. they have given us their
rooms. they were so very kind.â€

â€œlook at their figures!â€ laughed miss lavish. â€œthey walk through my
italy like a pair of cows. itâ€™s very naught

y of me, but i would like
to set an examination paper at dover, and turn back every tourist who
couldnâ€™t pass it.â€

â€œwhat would you ask us?â€

miss lavish laid her hand pleasantly on lucyâ€™s arm, as if to suggest
that she, at all events, would get full marks. in this exalted mood they
reached the steps of the great church, and were about to enter it when
miss lavish stopped, squeaked, flung up her arms, and cried:

â€œthere goes my local-colour box! i must have a word with him!â€

and in a moment she was away over the piazza, her military cloak
flapping in the wind; nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an
old man with white whiskers, and nipped him playfully upon the arm.

lucy waited for nearly ten minutes. then she began to get tired. the
beggars worried her, the dust blew in her eyes, and she remembered that
a young girl ought not to

loiter in public places. she descended slowly
into the piazza with the intention of rejoining miss lavish, who was
really almost too original. but at that moment miss lavish and her
local-colour box moved also, and disappeared down a side street, both
gesticulating largely. tears of indignation came to lucyâ€™s eyes partly
because miss lavish had jilted her, partly because she had taken her
baedeker. how could she find her way home? how could she find her way
about in santa croce? her first morning was ruined, and she might never
be in florence again. a few minutes ago she had been all high spirits,
talking as a woman of culture, and half persuading herself that she
was full of originality. now she entered the church depressed and
humiliated, not even able to remember whether it was built by the
franciscans or the dominicans.

are you doing here? are you doing the church? are you through with the
church?â€

â€œno,â€ cried lucy, remembering her grievance. â€œi came here with miss
lavish, who was to explain everything; and just by the door--it is too
bad!--she simply ran away, and after waiting quite a time, i had to come
in by myself.â€

â€œwhy shouldnâ€™t you?â€ said mr. emerson.

â€œyes, why shouldnâ€™t you come by yourself?â€ said the son, addressing the
young lady for the first time.

â€œbut miss lavish has even taken away baedeker.â€

â€œbaedeker?â€ said mr. emerson. â€œiâ€™m glad itâ€™s that you minded. itâ€™s worth
minding, the loss of a baedeker. thatâ€™s worth minding.â€

lucy was puzzled. she was again conscious of some new idea, and was not
sure whither it would lead her.

â€œif youâ€™ve no baedeker,â€ said the son, â€œyouâ€™d better join us.â€ was this
where the idea would lead? she took refuge in her dignity.

â€œthank you very much, but i could not think of that. i ho

say;
yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides, and lucy had
decided that they should triumph.

a very wet afternoon at the bertolini permitted her to do the thing she
really liked, and after lunch she opened the little draped piano. a few
people lingered round and praised her playing, but finding that she
made no reply, dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or
to sleep. she took no notice of mr. emerson looking for his son, nor of
miss bartlett looking for miss lavish, nor of miss lavish looking for
her cigarette-case. like every true performer, she was intoxicated by
the mere feel of the notes: they were fingers caressing her own; and by
touch, not by sound alone, did she come to her desire.

mr. beebe, sitting unnoticed in the window, pondered this illogical
element in miss honeychurch, and recalled the occasion at tunbridge
wells when he had discovered it. it was at one of those entertainments
where the upper classes entertain the lower. the seats

 meant--â€

â€œof course,â€ said he, wondering why she bothered to explain.

â€œmusic--â€ said lucy, as if attempting some generality. she could not
complete it, and looked out absently upon italy in the wet. the whole
life of the south was disorganized, and the most graceful nation in
europe had turned into formless lumps of clothes.

the street and the river were dirty yellow, the bridge was dirty grey,
and the hills were dirty purple. somewhere in their folds were concealed
miss lavish and miss bartlett, who had chosen this afternoon to visit
the torre del gallo.

â€œwhat about music?â€ said mr. beebe.

â€œpoor charlotte will be sopped,â€ was lucyâ€™s reply.

the expedition was typical of miss bartlett, who would return cold,
tired, hungry, and angelic, with a ruined skirt, a pulpy baedeker, and
a tickling cough in her throat. on another day, when the whole world was
singing and the air ran into the mouth, like wine, she would refuse to
stir from the drawing-room

, saying that she was an old thing, and no fit
companion for a hearty girl.

â€œmiss lavish has led your cousin astray. she hopes to find the true
italy in the wet i believe.â€

â€œmiss lavish is so original,â€ murmured lucy. this was a stock remark,
the supreme achievement of the pension bertolini in the way of
definition. miss lavish was so original. mr. beebe had his doubts, but
they would have been put down to clerical narrowness. for that, and for
other reasons, he held his peace.

â€œis it true,â€ continued lucy in awe-struck tone, â€œthat miss lavish is
writing a book?â€

â€œthey do say so.â€

â€œwhat is it about?â€

â€œit will be a novel,â€ replied mr. beebe, â€œdealing with modern italy.
let me refer you for an account to miss catharine alan, who uses words
herself more admirably than any one i know

â€œi wish miss lavish would tell me herself. we started such friends. but
i donâ€™t think she ought to have run away with baedeker that morning in
santa croce. charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone,
and so i couldnâ€™t help being a little annoyed with miss lavish.â€

â€œthe two ladies, at all events, have made it up.â€

he was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently
dissimilar as miss bartlett and miss lavish. they were always in each
otherâ€™s company, with lucy a slighted third. miss lavish he believed
he understood, but miss bartlett might reveal unknown depths of
strangeness, though not perhaps, of meaning. was italy deflecting
her from the path of prim chaperon, which he had assigned to her at
tunbridge wells? all his life he had loved to study maiden ladies;
they were his specialty, and his profession had provided him with ample
opportunities for the work. girls like lucy were charming

appointed in mr. beebe, having
expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and who
wore a pair of russet whiskers. indeed, who would have supposed that
tolerance, sympathy, and a sense of humour would inhabit that militant
form?

in the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle, and at last
the cause was disclosed. from the chair beneath her she extracted
a gun-metal cigarette-case, on which were powdered in turquoise the
initials â€œe. l.â€

â€œthat belongs to lavish.â€ said the clergyman. â€œa good fellow, lavish,
but i wish sheâ€™d start a pipe.â€

â€œoh, mr. beebe,â€ said miss alan, divided between awe and mirth. â€œindeed,
though it is dreadful for her to smoke, it is not quite as dreadful as
you suppose. she took to it, practically in despair, after her
lifeâ€™s work was carried away in a landslip. surely that makes it more
excusable.â€

â€œwhat was that?â€ asked lucy.

mr. beebe sat back complacently, and miss alan began as follows: â€

her jaw dropped. she was silent. mr. beebe, whose social resources were
endless, went out to order some tea, and she continued to lucy in a
hasty whisper:

â€œstomach. he warned miss pole of her stomach-acidity, he called it--and
he may have meant to be kind. i must say i forgot myself and laughed; it
was so sudden. as teresa truly said, it was no laughing matter. but the
point is that miss lavish was positively attracted by his mentioning
s., and said she liked plain speaking, and meeting different grades of
thought. she thought they were commercial travellers--â€˜drummersâ€™ was the
word she used--and all through dinner she tried to prove that england,
our great and beloved country, rests on nothing but commerce. teresa was
very much annoyed, and left the table before the cheese, saying as she
did so: â€˜there, miss lavish, is one who can confute you better than i,â€™

speaking. i reminded her how the queen had been to ireland when she did
not want to go, and i must say she was dumbfounded, and made no reply.

voice: â€˜quite so, quite so! i honour the woman for her irish visit.â€™ the

and said: â€˜miss alan, i am going into the smoking-room to talk to those
two nice men. come, too.â€™ needless to say, i refused such an unsuitable
invitation, and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would
broaden my ideas, and said that she had four brothers, all university
men, except one who was in the army, who always made a point of talking
to commercial travellers.â€

â€œlet me finish the story,â€ said mr. beebe, who had returned.

â€œmiss lavish tried

 miss pole, myself, everyone, and finally said:
â€˜i shall go alone.â€™ she went. at the end of five minutes she returned
unobtrusively with a green baize board, and began playing patience.â€

â€œwhatever happened?â€ cried lucy.

â€œno one knows. no one will ever know. miss lavish will never dare to
tell, and mr. emerson does not think it worth telling.â€

â€œmr. beebe--old mr. emerson, is he nice or not nice? i do so want to
know.â€

mr. beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for
herself.

â€œno; but it is so difficult. sometimes he is so silly, and then i do not
mind him. miss alan, what do you think? is he nice?â€

the little old lady shook her head, and sighed disapprovingly. mr.
beebe, whom the conversation amused, stirred he

they behaved at mr. eagerâ€™s lecture at santa croce. oh, poor miss
honeychurch! it really was too bad. no, i have quite changed. i do not
like the emersons. they are not nice.â€

mr. beebe smiled nonchalantly. he had made a gentle effort to introduce
the emersons into bertolini society, and the effort had failed. he was
almost the only person who remained friendly to them. miss lavish, who
represented intellect, was avowedly hostile, and now the miss alans,
who stood for good breeding, were following her. miss bartlett, smarting
under an obligation, would scarcely be civil. the case of lucy was
different. she had given him a hazy account of her adventures in santa
croce, and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and possibly
concerted attempt to annex her, to show her the world from their own
strange standpoint, to interest her in their private sorrows and j

knew which way charlotte bartlett
would turn.â€ she was perfectly pleasant and sensible over lucyâ€™s
adventure, found the abridged account of it quite adequate, and paid
suitable tribute to the courtesy of mr. george emerson. she and miss
lavish had had an adventure also. they had been stopped at the dazio
coming back, and the young officials there, who seemed impudent and
desoeuvre, had tried to search their reticules for provisions. it might
have been most unpleasant. fortunately miss lavish was a match for any
one.

for good or for evil, lucy was left to face her problem alone. none
of her friends had seen her, either in the piazza or, later on, by
the embankment. mr. beebe, indeed, noticing her startled eyes at
dinner-time, had again passed to himself the remark of â€œtoo much
beethoven.â€ but he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure,
not that she had encountered it. this solitude oppressed her; she was
accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or,

of yesterday! what a fortunate thing!â€

â€œaha! miss honeychurch, come you here i am in luck. now, you are to tell
me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning.â€ lucy poked at
the ground with her parasol.

â€œbut perhaps you would rather not?â€

â€œiâ€™m sorry--if you could manage without it, i think i would rather not.â€

the elder ladies exchanged glances, not of disapproval; it is suitable
that a girl should feel deeply.

â€œit is i who am sorry,â€ said miss lavish â€œliterary hacks are shameless
creatures. i believe thereâ€™s no secret of the human heart into which we
wouldnâ€™t pry.â€

she marched cheerfully to the fountain and back, and did a few
calculations in realism. then she said that she had been in the
piazza since eight oâ€™clock collecting material. a good deal of it was
unsuitable, but of course one always had to adapt. the two men had
quarrelled over a five-franc note. for the five-franc note she should
substitute a young lady, whi

ch would raise the tone of the tragedy, and
at the same time furnish an excellent plot.

â€œwhat is the heroineâ€™s name?â€ asked miss bartlett.

â€œleonora,â€ said miss lavish; her own name was eleanor.

â€œi do hope sheâ€™s nice.â€

that desideratum would not be omitted.

â€œand what is the plot?â€

love, murder, abduction, revenge, was the plot. but it all came while
the fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun.

â€œi hope you will excuse me for boring on like this,â€ miss lavish
concluded. â€œit is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people.
of course, this is the barest outline. there will be a deal of local
colouring, descriptions

 of florence and the neighbourhood, and i shall
also introduce some humorous characters. and let me give you all fair
warning: i intend to be unmerciful to the british tourist.â€

â€œoh, you wicked woman,â€ cried miss bartlett. â€œi am sure you are thinking
of the emersons.â€

miss lavish gave a machiavellian smile.

â€œi confess that in italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen.
it is the neglected italians who attract me, and whose lives i am going
to paint so far as i can. for i repeat and i insist, and i have always
held most strongly, that a tragedy such as yesterdayâ€™s is not the less
tragic because it happened in humble life.â€

there was a fitting silence when miss lavish had concluded. then the
cousins wished success to her labours, and walked slowly

the very best sense of the word,â€
 continued miss bartlett slowly. â€œnone but the superficial would be
shocked at her. we had a long talk yesterday. she believes in justice
and truth and human interest. she told me also that she has a high
opinion of the destiny of woman--mr. eager! why, how nice! what a
pleasant surprise!â€

â€œah, not for me,â€ said the chaplain blandly, â€œfor i have been watching
you and miss honeychurch for quite a little time.â€

â€œwe were chatting to miss lavish.â€

his brow contracted.

â€œso i saw. were you indeed? andate via! sono occupato!â€ the last remark
was made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a
courteous smile. â€œi am about to venture a suggestion. would you and
miss honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week--a
drive in the hills? we might go up by fiesole and back by settignano.
there is a point on that road where we could get down and have an
hourâ€™s ramble on the hillside. t

this successful morning left no pleasant impressions on lucy. she had
been a little frightened, both by miss lavish and by mr. eager, she knew
not why. and as they frightened her, she had, strangely enough, ceased
to respect them. she doubted that miss lavish was a great artist. she
doubted that mr. eager was as full of spirituality and culture as she
had been led to suppose. they were tried by some new test, and they were
found wanting. as for charlotte--as for charlotte she was exactly the
same. it might be possible to be nice to her; it was impossible to love
her.

all. why should he invite us in that absurd manner? we might as well
invite him. we are each paying for ourselves.â€

miss bartlett, who had intended to lament over the emersons, was
launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts.

â€œif that is so, dear--if the drive we and mr. beebe are going with mr.
eager is really the same as the one we are going with mr. beebe, then i
foresee a sad kettle of fish.â€

â€œhow?â€

â€œbecause mr. beebe has asked eleanor lavish to come, too.â€

â€œthat will mean another carriage.â€

â€œfar worse. mr. eager does not like eleanor. she knows it herself. the
truth must be told; she is too unconventional for him.â€

they were now in the newspaper-room at the english bank. lucy stood by
the central table, heedless of punch and the graphic, trying to answer,
or at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her brain. the
well-known world had broken up, and there emerged florence, a magic
city where people

miss bartlett, with equal vivacity, replied:

â€œoh, you droll person! pray, what would become of your drive in the
hills?â€

they passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square, laughing
over the unpractical suggestion.



chapter vi: the reverend arthur beebe, the reverend cuthbert eager,
mr. emerson, mr. george emerson, miss eleanor lavish, miss charlotte
bartlett, and miss lucy honeychurch drive out in carriages to see a
view; italians drive them.

it was phaethon who drove them to fiesole that memorable day, a youth
all irresponsibility and fire, recklessly urging his masterâ€™s horses up
the stony hill. mr. beebe recognized him at once. neither the ages of
faith nor the age of doubt had touched him; he was phaethon in tuscany
driving a cab. and it was persephone whom he asked leave to pick up on
the way, saying that s

phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head, thus enabling
himself to drive with his arm round her waist. she did not mind.
mr. eager, who sat with his back to the horses, saw nothing of the
indecorous proceeding, and continued his conversation with lucy. the
other two occupants of the carriage were old mr. emerson and miss
lavish. for a dreadful thing had happened: mr. beebe, without consulting
mr. eager, had doubled the size of the party. and though miss bartlett
and miss lavish had planned all the morning how the people were to sit,
at the critical moment when the carriages came round they lost their
heads, and miss lavish got in with lucy, while miss bartlett, with
george emerson and mr. beebe, followed on behind.

it was hard on the poor chaplain to have his partie carree thus
transformed. tea at a renaissance villa, if he had ever meditated it,
was now impossible. lucy and miss bartlett had a certain style about
them, and mr. beebe, though unreliable, was a

she avoided george it became more imperative that she should avoid
him again. and now celestial irony, working through her cousin and two
clergymen, did not suffer her to leave florence till she had made this
expedition with him through the hills.

meanwhile mr. eager held her in civil converse; their little tiff was
over.

â€œso, miss honeychurch, you are travelling? as a student of art?â€

â€œoh, dear me, no--oh, no!â€

â€œperhaps as a student of human nature,â€ interposed miss lavish, â€œlike
myself?â€

â€œoh, no. i am here as a tourist.â€

â€œoh, indeed,â€ said mr. eager. â€œare you indeed? if you will not think me
rude, we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little--handed
about like a parcel of goods from venice to florence, from florence to
rome, living herded together in pensions or hotels, quite unconscious
of anything that is outside baedeker, their one anxiety to get â€˜doneâ€™
or â€˜throughâ€™ and go on somewhere else. the result is, they

â€œi quite agree,â€ said miss lavish, who had several times tried to
interrupt his mordant wit. â€œthe narrowness and superficiality of the
anglo-saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace.â€

â€œquite so. now, the english colony at florence, miss honeychurch--and it
is of considerable size, though, of course, not all equally--a few are
here for trade, for example. but the greater part are students. lady
helen laverstock is at present busy over fra angelico. i mention her

the decameron, which lends it an additional interest, does it not?â€

â€œit does indeed!â€ cried miss lavish. â€œtell me, where do they place the
scene of that wonderful seventh day?â€

but mr. eager proceeded to tell miss honeychurch that on the right lived
mr. someone something, an american of the best type--so rare!--and that
the somebody elses were farther down the hill. â€œdoubtless you know

er disgracefully. lucy had a spasm of envy. granted that they wished
to misbehave, it was pleasant for them to be able to do so. they were
probably the only people enjoying the expedition. the carriage swept
with agonizing jolts up through the piazza of fiesole and into the
settignano road.

â€œpiano! piano!â€ said mr. eager, elegantly waving his hand over his head.

â€œva bene, signore, va bene, va bene,â€ crooned the driver, and whipped
his horses up again.

now mr. eager and miss lavish began to talk against each other on the
subject of alessio baldovinetti. was he a cause of the renaissance, or
was he one of its manifestations? the other carriage was left behind. as
the pace increased to a gallop the large, slumbering form of mr. emerson
was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a machine.

â€œpiano! piano!â€ said he, with a martyred look at lucy.

an extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat. phaethon, who for some
time had been endeavouring to kis

immediately to get down.

â€œshe is my sister,â€ said he, turning round on them with piteous eyes.

mr. eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar.

phaethon hung down his head, not at the matter of the accusation, but
at its manner. at this point mr. emerson, whom the shock of stopping
had awoke, declared that the lovers must on no account be separated, and
patted them on the back to signify his approval. and miss lavish, though
unwilling to ally him, felt bound to support the cause of bohemianism.

â€œmost certainly i would let them be,â€ she cried. â€œbut i dare say i
shall receive scant support. i have always flown in the face of the
conventions all my life. this is what i call an adventure.â€

â€œwe must not submit,â€ said mr. eager. â€œi knew he was trying it on. he is
treating us as if we were a party of cookâ€™s tourists.â€

â€œsurely no!â€ said miss lavish, her ardour visibly decreasing.

is not victory,â€ said mr. emerson. â€œit is defeat. you have parted
two people who were happy.â€

mr. eager shut his eyes. he was obliged to sit next to mr. emerson, but
he would not speak to him. the old man was refreshed by sleep, and took
up the matter warmly. he commanded lucy to agree with him; he shouted
for support to his son.

â€œwe have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money. he has bargained
to drive us, and he is doing it. we have no rights over his soul.â€

miss lavish frowned. it is hard when a person you have classed as
typically british speaks out of his character.

â€œhe was not driving us well,â€ she said. â€œhe jolted us.â€

â€œthat i deny. it was as restful as sleeping. aha! he is jolting us now.
can you wonder? he would like to throw us out, and most certainly he is
justified. and if i were superstitious iâ€™d be frightened of the girl,

bushes and occasional trees, which had caught the fancy of
alessio baldovinetti nearly five hundred years before. he had ascended
it, that diligent and rather obscure master, possibly with an eye to
business, possibly for the joy of ascending. standing there, he had seen
that view of the val dâ€™arno and distant florence, which he afterwards
had introduced not very effectively into his work. but where exactly had
he stood? that was the question which mr. eager hoped to solve now. and
miss lavish, whose nature was attracted by anything problematical, had
become equally enthusiastic.

but it is not easy to carry the pictures of alessio baldovinetti in your
head, even if you have remembered to look at them before starting. and
the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest.

the party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass, their anxiety to keep
together being only equalled by their desire to go different directions.
finally they split into groups. lucy clung to mi

at was now so familiar to lucy they began to discuss, not alessio
baldovinetti, but the drive. miss bartlett had asked mr. george emerson
what his profession was, and he had answered â€œthe railway.â€ she was very
sorry that she had asked him. she had no idea that it would be such a
dreadful answer, or she would not have asked him. mr. beebe had turned
the conversation so cleverly, and she hoped that the young man was not
very much hurt at her asking him.

â€œthe railway!â€ gasped miss lavish. â€œoh, but i shall die! of course it
was the railway!â€ she could not control her mirth. â€œhe is the image of a
porter--on, on the south-eastern.â€

â€œeleanor, be quiet,â€ plucking at her vivacious companion. â€œhush! theyâ€™ll
hear--the emersons--â€

â€œi canâ€™t stop. let me go my wicked way. a porter--â€

â€œeleanor!â€

â€œiâ€™m sure itâ€™s all right,â€ put in lucy. â€œthe emersons wonâ€™t hear, and
they wouldnâ€™t mind if they did.â€

miss lavish did not seem please

â€œmiss honeychurch listening!â€ she said rather crossly. â€œpouf! wouf! you
naughty girl! go away!â€

â€œoh, lucy, you ought to be with mr. eager, iâ€™m sure.â€

â€œi canâ€™t find them now, and i donâ€™t want to either.â€

â€œmr. eager will be offended. it is your party.â€

â€œplease, iâ€™d rather stop here with you.â€

â€œno, i agree,â€ said miss lavish. â€œitâ€™s like a school feast; the boys
have got separated from the girls. miss lucy, you are to go. we wish to
converse on high topics unsuited for your ear.â€

the girl was stubborn. as her time at florence drew to its close she was
only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent. such a one was
miss lavish, and such for the moment was charlotte. she wished she had
not called attention to herself; they were both annoyed at her remark
and seemed determined to get rid of her.

â€œhow tired one gets,â€ said miss bartlett. â€œoh, i do wish freddy and your
mother could be here.â€

unselfishness with miss bartlett had entirely usurped the functions of
enthusiasm. lucy did not look at the view either. she would not enjoy
anything till she was safe at rome.

â€œthen sit you down,â€ said miss lavish. â€œobserve my foresight.â€

with many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that
protect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps.
she sat on one; who was to sit on the other?

â€œlucy; without a momentâ€™s doubt, lucy. the ground will do for me. really
i have not had rheumatism for years. if i do feel it coming on i shall

reabouts to find him. mr. beebe, who wore the
heated aspect of a neutral, was bidden to collect the factions for the
return home. there was a general sense of groping and bewilderment. pan
had been amongst them--not the great god pan, who has been buried these
two thousand years, but the little god pan, who presides over social
contretemps and unsuccessful picnics. mr. beebe had lost everyone, and
had consumed in solitude the tea-basket which he had brought up as a
pleasant surprise. miss lavish had lost miss bartlett. lucy had lost mr.
eager. mr. emerson had lost george. miss bartlett had lost a mackintosh
square. phaethon had lost the game.

that last fact was undeniable. he climbed on to the box shivering, with
his collar up, prophesying the swift approach of bad weather. â€œlet us go
immediately,â€ he told them. â€œthe signorino will walk.â€

â€œall the way? he will be hours,â€ said mr. beebe.

â€œapparently. i told him it was unwise.â€ he would look no one in the

perhaps they might have been hurt. they chose to regard
it as a miraculous preservation, and the floods of love and sincerity,
which fructify every hour of life, burst forth in tumult. they descended
from the carriages; they embraced each other. it was as joyful to be
forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them. for a moment they
realized vast possibilities of good.

the older people recovered quickly. in the very height of their emotion
they knew it to be unmanly or unladylike. miss lavish calculated that,
even if they had continued, they would not have been caught in the
accident. mr. eager mumbled a temperate prayer. but the drivers, through
miles of dark squalid road, poured out their souls to the dryads and the
saints, and lucy poured out hers to her cousin.

â€œcharlotte, dear charlotte, kiss me. kiss me again. only you can
understand me. you warned me to be careful. and i--i thought i was
developing.â€

â€œdo not cry, dearest. take your time.â€

â€œi want to be truthful,â€ she whispered. â€œit is so hard to be absolutely
truthful.â€

â€œdonâ€™t be troubled, dearest. wait till you are calmer. we will talk it
over before bed-time in my room.â€

so they re-entered the city with hands clasped. it was a shock to the
girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others. the storm had ceased,
and mr. emerson was easier about his son. mr. beebe had regained good
humour, and mr. eager was already snubbing miss lavish. charlotte alone
she was sure of--charlotte, whose exterior concealed so much insight and
love.

the luxury of self-exposure kept her almost happy through the long
evening. she thought not so much of what had happened as of how she
should describe it. all her sensations, her spasms of courage, her
moments of unreasonable joy, her mysterious discontent, should be
carefully laid before her cousin. and together in divine confidence they
would disentangle and interpret them all.

acquaintance of her mother, so there was no impropriety in the plan and
miss bartlett had replied that she was quite used to being abandoned
suddenly. finally nothing happened; but the coolness remained, and, for
lucy, was even increased when she opened the letter and read as follows.
it had been forwarded from windy corner.

â€œseptember.

â€œdearest lucia,

â€œi have news of you at last! miss lavish has been bicycling in your
parts, but was not sure whether a call would be welcome. puncturing
her tire near summer street, and it being mended while she sat very
woebegone in that pretty churchyard, she saw to her astonishment, a door
open opposite and the younger emerson man come out. he said his father
had just taken the house. he said he did not know that you lived in the
neighbourhood (?). he never suggested giving eleanor a cup of tea. dear
lucy, i am much worried, and i advise you

â€œdear charlotte,

â€œmany thanks for your warning. when mr. emerson forgot himself on the
mountain, you made me promise not to tell mother, because you said she
would blame you for not being always with me. i have kept that promise,
and cannot possibly tell her now. i have said both to her and cecil
that i met the emersons at florence, and that they are respectable
people--which i do think--and the reason that he offered miss lavish no
tea was probably that he had none himself. she should have tried at the
rectory. i cannot begin making a fuss at this stage. you must see that
it would be too absurd. if the emersons heard i had complained of them,
they would think themselves of importance, which is exactly what they
are not. i like the old father, and look forward to seeing him again.
as for the son, i am sorry for him when we meet, rather than for myself.

 but who could not
bear silence, was compelled to chatter, since the expedition looked like
a failure, and neither of his companions would utter a word. he spoke of
florence. george attended gravely, assenting or dissenting with slight
but determined gestures that were as inexplicable as the motions of the
tree-tops above their heads.

â€œand what a coincidence that you should meet mr. vyse! did you realize
that you would find all the pension bertolini down here?â€

â€œi did not. miss lavish told me.â€

coincidence.â€™â€

no enthusiasm.

â€œthough, as a matter of fact, coincidences are much rarer than we
suppose. for example, it isnâ€™t purely coincidentally that you are here
now, when one comes to reflect.â€

to his relief, george began to talk.

lucy burst into laughter. â€œâ€˜joseph emery prankâ€™ indeed! why itâ€™s miss

elseâ€™s name.â€

ought to read it as oneâ€™s met her.â€

â€œall modern books are bad,â€ said cecil, who was annoyed at her
inattention, and vented his annoyance on literature. â€œevery one writes

she heard her voice saying: â€œit isnâ€™t worth reading--itâ€™s too silly
to read--i never saw such rubbish--it oughtnâ€™t to be allowed to be
printed.â€

he took the book from her.

â€œâ€˜leonora,â€™â€ he read, â€œâ€˜sat pensive and alone. before her lay the rich
champaign of tuscany, dotted over with many a smiling village. the
season was spring.â€™â€

miss lavish knew, somehow, and had printed the past in draggled prose,
for cecil to read and for george to hear.

â€œâ€˜a golden haze,â€™â€ he read. he read: â€œâ€˜afar off the towers of florence,

membering that she

of george; he was nothing to her; he never had been anything; he
had behaved abominably; she had never encouraged him. the armour of
falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness, and hides a man not only
from others, but from his own soul. in a few moments lucy was equipped
for battle.

â€œsomething too awful has happened,â€ she began, as soon as her cousin
arrived. â€œdo you know anything about miss lavishâ€™s novel?â€

miss bartlett looked surprised, and said that she had not read the book,

importance that they attach to words. a rector lives in a web of petty
secrets, and confidences and warnings, and the wiser he is the less he
will regard them. he will change the subject, as did mr. beebe, saying
cheerfully: â€œhave you heard from any bertolini people lately? i believe
you keep up with miss lavish. it is odd how we of that pension,
who seemed such a fortuitous collection, have been working into one
anotherâ€™s lives. two, three, four, six of us--no, eight; i had forgotten
the emersons--have kept more or less in touch. we must really give the
signora a testimonial.â€

and, miss bartlett not favouring the scheme, they walked up the hill in
a silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern. on the
summit they paused. the sky had grown wilder since he stood there last

george told him that he was mistaken; they had no money to throw away on
driving.

and the people who had not meant to help--the miss lavishes, the cecils,
the miss bartletts! ever prone to magnify fate, george counted up the
forces that had swept him into this contentment.

â€œanything good in freddyâ€™s letter?â€

â€œnot yet.â€

his own content was absolute, but hers held bitterness: the
honeychurches had not forgiven them; they were disgusted at her past
hypocrisy; she had alienated windy corner, perhaps for ever.
