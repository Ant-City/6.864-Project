  talbot. o young john talbot! i did send for thee
    to tutor thee in stratagems of war,
    that talbot's name might be in thee reviv'd
    when sapless age and weak unable limbs
    should bring thy father to his drooping chair.
    but, o malignant and ill-boding stars!
    now thou art come unto a feast of death,
    a terrible and unavoided danger;
    therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse,
    and i'll direct thee how thou shalt escape
    by sudden flight. come, dally not, be gone.
  john. is my name talbot, and am i your son?
    and shall i fly? o, if you love my mother,
    dishonour not her honourable name,
    to make a bastard and a slave of me!
    the world will say he is not talbot's blood
    that basely fled when noble talbot stood.
  talbot. fly to revenge my death, if i be slain.

st was lost and done

    to my determin'd time thou gav'st new date.
  talbot. when from the dauphin's crest thy sword struck
    fire,
    it warm'd thy father's heart with proud desire
    of bold-fac'd victory. then leaden age,
    quicken'd with youthful spleen and warlike rage,
    beat down alencon, orleans, burgundy,
    and from the pride of gallia rescued thee.
    the ireful bastard orleans, that drew blood
    from thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood
    of thy first fight, i soon encountered
    and, interchanging blows, i quickly shed
    some of his bastard blood; and in disgrace
    bespoke him thus: 'contaminated, base,
    and misbegotten blood i spill of thine,
    mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine
    which thou didst force from talbot, my brave boy.'
    here purposing the bastard to destroy,
    came in strong rescue. speak, thy father's care;

    the help of one stands me in little stead.
    o, too much folly is it, well i wot,
    to hazard all our lives in one small boat!
    if i to-day die not with frenchmen's rage,
    to-morrow i shall die with mickle age.
    by me they nothing gain an if i stay:

    all these and more we hazard by thy stay;
    all these are sav'd if thou wilt fly away.
  john. the sword of orleans hath not made me smart;
    these words of yours draw life-blood from my heart.
    on that advantage, bought with such a shame,
    to save a paltry life and slay bright fame,
    before young talbot from old talbot fly,
    the coward horse that bears me fall and die!
    and like me to the peasant boys of france,
    to be shame's scorn and subject of mischance!
    surely, by all the glory you have won,
    an if i fly, i am not talbot's son;
    then talk no more of flight, it is no boot;
    if son to talbot, die at talbot's foot.
  talbot. then follow thou thy desp'rate sire of crete,
    thou icarus; thy life to me is sweet.
    if thou wilt fight, fight by thy father's side;
    and, commendable prov'd, let's die in pride.          exeunt

ivity,
    young talbot's valour makes me smile at thee.
    when he perceiv'd me shrink and on my knee,
    his bloody sword he brandish'd over me,
    and like a hungry lion did commence
    rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;
    but when my angry guardant stood alone,
    tend'ring my ruin and assail'd of none,
    dizzy-ey'd fury and great rage of heart
    suddenly made him from my side to start
    into the clust'ring battle of the french;
    and in that sea of blood my boy did drench
    his overmounting spirit; and there died,
    my icarus, my blossom, in his pride.
