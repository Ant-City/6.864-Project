Don Pedro - 
                An
important nobleman from Aragon, sometimes referred to as "Prince."
Don Pedro is a longtime friend of Leonato, Hero's father, and is
also close to the soldiers who have been fighting under him--the younger
Benedick and the very young Claudio. Don Pedro is generous, courteous,
intelligent, and loving to his friends, but he is also quick to
believe evil of others and hasty to take revenge. He is the most
politically and socially powerful character in the play.
