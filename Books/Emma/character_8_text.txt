â€œemma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,â€ rejoined mr. woodhouse, understanding but in part. â€œbut, my dear, pray do not make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up oneâ€™s family circle grievously.â€
â€œonly one more, papa; only for mr. elton. poor mr. elton! you like mr. elton, papa,â€”i must look about for a wife for him. there is nobody in highbury who deserves himâ€”and he has been here a whole year, and has fitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have him single any longerâ€”and i thought when he was joining their hands to-day, he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him! i think very well of mr. elton, and this is the only way i have of doing him a service.â€

â€œwith a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,â€ said mr. knightley, laughing, â€œand i agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better thing. invite him to dinner, emma, and help him to the best

ls in the same parish, and donwell abbey in the parish adjoining, the seat of mr. knightley, comprehended many such. not unfrequently, through emmaâ€™s persuasion, he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he preferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make up a card-table for him.
real, long-standing regard brought the westons and mr. knightley; and by mr. elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of mr. woodhouseâ€™s drawing-room, and the smiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.
after these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were mrs. and miss bates, and mrs. goddard, three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield, and who were fetched and carried home so often, tha

â€œcertainly, he is not like mr. knightley. he has not such a fine air and way of walking as mr. knightley. i see the difference plain enough. but mr. knightley is so very fine a man!â€
â€œmr. knightleyâ€™s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare mr. martin with him. you might not see one in a hundred with gentleman so plainly written as in mr. knightley. but he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to. what say you to mr. weston and mr. elton? compare mr. martin with either of them. compare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being silent. you must see the difference.â€
â€œoh yes!â€”there is a great difference. but mr. weston is almost an old man. mr. weston must be between forty and fifty.â€
â€œwhich makes his good manners the more valuable. the older a person grows, harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or

â€œi wonder he did not remember the bookâ€â€”was all harrietâ€™s answer, and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which emma thought might be safely left to itself. she, therefore, said no more for some time. her next beginning was,
â€œin one respect, perhaps, mr. eltonâ€™s manners are superior to mr. knightleyâ€™s or mr. westonâ€™s. they have more gentleness. they might be more safely held up as a pattern. there is an openness, a quickness, almost a bluntness in mr. weston, which every body likes in him, because there is so much good-humour with itâ€”but that would not do to be copied. neither would mr. knightleyâ€™s downright, decided, commanding sort of manner, though it suits him very well; his figure, and look, and situation in life seem to allow it; but

if any young man were to set about copying him, he would not be sufferable. on the contrary, i think a young man might be very safely recommended to take mr. elton as a model. mr. elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. i do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us, harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be. if he means any thing, it must be to please you. did not i tell you what he said of you the other day?â€

mr. elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving the young farmer out of harrietâ€™s head. she thought it would be an excellent match; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her to have much merit in planning it. she feared it was what every body else must think of and predict. it was not likely, however, that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of harrietâ€™s coming to hartfield. the longer sh

e considered it, the greater was her sense of its expediency. mr. eltonâ€™s situation was most suitable, quite the gentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet. he had a comfortable home for her, and emma imagined a very sufficient income; for though the vicarage of highbury was not large, he was known to have some independent property; and she thought very highly of him as a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without any deficiency of useful understandi

e doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy. and he was really a very pleasing young man, a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like. he was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her, there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with:â€”but the girl who could be gratified by a robert martinâ€™s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by mr. eltonâ€™s admiration.

chapter vi

emma could not feel a doubt of having given harrietâ€™s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of mr. eltonâ€™s being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on harrietâ€™s side, as there could be any occasion for. she was quite convinced of mr. eltonâ€™s being in the fairest way of falling in love, if not in love already. she had no scruple with regard to him. he talked of harriet, and praised her so warmly, that she could not suppo

â€œi am glad you think i have been useful to her; but harriet only wanted drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. she had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. i have done very little.â€
â€œif it were admissible to contradict a lady,â€ said the gallant mr. eltonâ€”
â€œi have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before.â€
â€œexactly so; that is what principally strikes me. so much superadded decision of character! skilful has been the hand!â€

â€œlet me entreat you,â€ cried mr. elton; â€œit would indeed be a delight! let me entreat you, miss woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend. i know what your drawings are. how could you suppose me ignorant? is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers; and has not mrs. weston some inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room, at randalls?â€

â€œexactly soâ€”the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouthâ€”i have not a doubt of your success. pray, pray attempt it. as you will do it, it will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession.â€

mr. elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and was repeating, â€œno husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as you observe. exactly so. no husbands and wives,â€ with so interesting a consciousness, that emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once. but as she wanted to be drawing, the declaration must wait a little longer.

the sitting began; and harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. but there was no doing any thing, with mr. elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch. she gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to it, and request him to place himself elsewhere. it then occurred to her to employ him in reading.
â€œif he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness indeed! it would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen the irksomeness of miss smithâ€™s.â€
mr. elton was only too happy. harriet liste

to wish to go on. there was no want of likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more height, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling its destined place with credit to them bothâ€”a standing memorial of the beauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both; with as many other agreeable associations as mr. eltonâ€™s very promising attachment was likely to add.
harriet was to sit again the next day; and mr. elton, just as he ought, entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.
â€œby all means. we shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party.â€
the same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction, took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the picture, which was rapid and happy. every body who saw it was pleased, but mr. elton was i

â€œdo you think so?â€ replied he. â€œi cannot agree with you. it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature. i never saw such a likeness in my life. we must allow for the effect of shade, you know.â€
â€œyou have made her too tall, emma,â€ said mr. knightley.
emma knew that she had, but would not own it; and mr. elton warmly added,
â€œoh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. consider, she is sitting downâ€”which naturally presents a differentâ€”which in short gives exactly the ideaâ€”and the proportions must be preserved, you know. proportions, fore-shortening.â€”oh no! it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smithâ€™s. exactly so indeed!â€

â€œbut it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.â€

mr. elton was to take the drawing to london, chuse the frame, and give the directions; and emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him, while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough.
â€œwhat a precious deposit!â€ said he with a tender sigh, as he received it.

chapter vii

the very day of mr. eltonâ€™s going to london produced a fresh occasion for emmaâ€™s services towards her friend. harriet had been at hartfield, as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been talked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell. half a minute brought it all out. she had heard, as soon as she got back to mrs. goddardâ€™s, that mr. martin had been

er and sisters would think and say, and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful, that emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment, he would have been accepted after all.
this letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. the business was finished, and harriet safe. she was rather low all the evening, but emma could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the idea of mr. elton.
â€œi shall never be invited to abbey-mill again,â€ was said in rather a sorrowful tone.
â€œnor, if you were, could i ever bear to part with you, my harriet. you are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared to abbey-mill.â€
â€œand i am sure i should never want to go there; for i am never happy but at hartfield.â€
some time afterwards it was, â€œi think mrs. goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened. i am sure miss nash wouldâ€”for miss nash thinks her own

harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that people should like her so much. the idea of mr. elton was certainly cheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towards the rejected mr. martin.
â€œnow he has got my letter,â€ said she softly. â€œi wonder what they are all doingâ€”whether his sisters knowâ€”if he is unhappy, they will be unhappy too. i hope he will not mind it so very much.â€
â€œlet us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed,â€ cried emma. â€œat this moment, perhaps, mr. elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters

harriet smiled again, and her smiles

s too true for contradiction, and therefore said nothing. he presently added, with a smile,
â€œi do not pretend to fix on times or places, but i must tell you that i have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage.â€
â€œindeed! how so? of what sort?â€
â€œa very serious sort, i assure you;â€ still smiling.
â€œvery serious! i can think of but one thingâ€”who is in love with her? who makes you their confidant?â€
emma was more than half in hopes of mr. eltonâ€™s having dropt a hint. mr. knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew mr. elton looked up to him.
â€œi have reason to think,â€ he replied, â€œthat harriet smith will soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable quarter:â€”robert martin is the man. her visit to abbey-mill, this summer, seems to have done his business. he is desperately in love and means to marry her.â€
â€œhe is very obliging,â€ said emma; â€œbut is he sure that harriet means to marry
 
 ___________________________
 
ce, with only one attempt on emmaâ€™s side to talk of the weather, but he made no answer. he was thinking. the result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words.
â€œrobert martin has no great lossâ€”if he can but think so; and i hope it will not be long before he does. your views for harriet are best known to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it is fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;â€”and as a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man, i think it will be all labour in vain.â€
emma laughed and disclaimed. he continued,
â€œdepend upon it, elton will not do. elton is a very good sort of man, and a very respectable vicar of highbury, but not at all likely to make an imprudent match. he knows the value of a good income as well as any body. elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. he is as well acquainted with his own claims, as you can be with harrietâ€™s. he knows that he is a very handsome young man

, and a great favourite wherever he goes; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments, when there are only men present, i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away. i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece.â€
â€œi am very much obliged to you,â€ said emma, laughing again. â€œif i had set my heart on mr. eltonâ€™s marrying harriet, it would have been very kind to open my eyes; but at present i only want to keep harriet to myself. i have done with match-making indeed. i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls. i shall leave off while i am well.â€
â€œgood morning to you,â€â€”said he, rising and walking off abruptly. he was very much vexed. he felt the disappointment of the young man, and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he had given; and the part which

 and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. the dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when harriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any such reason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let mr. knightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing which womanâ€™s friendship and womanâ€™s feelings would not justify.
he had frightened her a little about mr. elton; but when she considered that mr. knightley could not have observed him as she had done, neither with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself, in spite of mr. knightleyâ€™s pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger, she was able to believe, that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true, than what he knew any thing about. he certainly might have heard mr. elton speak with more unreserve

 than she had ever done, and mr. elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money matters; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them; but then, mr. knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives. mr. knightley saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its effects; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest; and more than a reasona

harrietâ€™s cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not to think of mr. martin, but to talk of mr. elton. miss nash had been telling her something, which she repeated immediately with great delight. mr. perry had been to mrs. goddardâ€™s to attend a sick child, and miss nash had seen him, and he had told miss nash, that as he was coming back yesterday from clayton park, he had met mr. elton, and found to his great surprize, that mr. elton was actually on his road to london, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the whist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and mr. perry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby it was in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would not do; mr. elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a very parti

cular way indeed, that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a very enviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious. mr. perry could not quite understand him, but he was very sure there must be a lady in the case, and he told him so; and mr. elton only looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits. miss nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal more about mr. elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her, â€œthat she did not pretend to understand what his business might be, but she only knew that any woman whom mr. elton could prefer, she should think the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, mr. elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness.â€

the picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after mr. eltonâ€™s return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought; and as for harrietâ€™s feelings, they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted. emma was soon perfectly satisfied of mr. martinâ€™s being no otherwise remembered, than as he furnished a contrast with mr. elton, of the utmost advantage to the latter.

it was by no means his daughterâ€™s wish that the intellects of highbury in general should be put under requisition. mr. elton was the only one whose assistance she asked. he was invited to contribute any really good enigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might recollect; and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections; and at the same time, as she could perceive, most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips. they owed to him their two or three politest puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at last

made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already.
â€œwhy will not you write one yourself for us, mr. elton?â€ said she; â€œthat is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be easier to you.â€
â€œoh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in his life. the stupidest fellow! he was afraid not even miss woodhouseâ€â€”he stopt a momentâ€”â€œor miss smith could inspire him.â€

harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. she read the concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. she could not speak. but she was not wanted to speak. it was enough for her to feel. emma spoke for her.
â€œthere is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment,â€ said she, â€œthat i cannot have a doubt as to mr. eltonâ€™s intentions. you are his objectâ€”and you will soon receive the completest proof of it. i thought it must be so. i thought i could not be so deceived; but now, it is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided, as my wishes on the subject have been ever since i knew you. yes, harriet, just so long have i been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened. i could never tell whether an attachment between you and mr. elton were most desirable or most natural. its probabili

â€œdear miss woodhouse!â€â€”and â€œdear miss woodhouse,â€ was all that harriet, with many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they did arrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered just as she ought. mr. eltonâ€™s superiority had very ample acknowledgment.
â€œwhatever you say is always right,â€ cried harriet, â€œand therefore i suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise i could not have imagined it. it is so much beyond any thing i deserve. mr. elton, who might marry any body! there cannot be two opinions about him. he is so very superior. only think of those sweet versesâ€”â€˜to miss â€”â€”â€”.â€™ dear me, how clever!â€”could it really be meant for me?â€

mr. elton certainly did not very well know what to say. he looked rather doubtinglyâ€”rather confused; said something about â€œhonour,â€â€”glanced at emma and at harriet, and then seeing the book open on the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively. with the view of passing off an awkward moment, emma smilingly said,

chapter x

though now the middle of december, there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the morrow, emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, who lived a little way out of highbury.
their road to this detached cottage was down vicarage lane, a lane leading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street of the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of mr. elton. a few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then, about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the vicarage, an old and not very good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. it had no advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes.â€”emmaâ€™s remark wasâ€”
â€œthere it is. there go you and your riddle-book one o

 yellow curtains that miss nash admires so much.â€
â€œi do not often walk this way now,â€ said emma, as they proceeded, â€œbut then there will be an inducement, and i shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of this part of highbury.â€
harriet, she found, had never in her life been inside the vicarage, and her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors and probabilities, emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with mr. eltonâ€™s seeing ready wit in her.
â€œi wish we could contrive it,â€ said she; â€œbut i cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in;â€”no servant that i want to inquire about of his housekeeperâ€”no message from my father.â€
she pondered, but could think of nothing. after a mutual silence of some minutes, harriet thus began againâ€”
â€œi do so wonder, miss woodhouse, that you should not be married, or going to be married! so charming as you are!â€â€”
emma laughed, and replied,
â€œmy being

â€œah!â€”so you say; but i cannot believe it.â€
â€œi must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet, to be tempted; mr. elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of the question: and i do not wish to see any such person. i would rather not be tempted. i cannot really change for the better. if i were to marry, i must expect to repent it.â€
â€œdear me!â€”it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!â€â€”
â€œi have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. were i to fall in love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but i never have been in love; it is not my way, or my nature; and i do not think i ever shall. a

â€œand really, i do not think the impression will soon be over,â€ said emma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended the narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them into the lane again. â€œi do not think it will,â€ stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the still greater within.
â€œoh! dear, no,â€ said her companion.
they walked on. the lane made a slight bend; and when that bend was passed, mr. elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give emma time only to say farther,
â€œah! harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts. well, (smiling,) i hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all that is truly important. if we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we can for them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to ourselves.â€
harriet could just answer, â€œoh! dear, yes,â€ before the

gentleman joined them. the wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were the first subject on meeting. he had been going to call on them. his visit he would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done. mr. elton then turned back to accompany them.
â€œto fall in with each other on such an errand as this,â€ thought emma; â€œto meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase of love on each side. i should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration. it must, if i were not here. i wish i were anywhere else.â€
anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one side of the lane, leaving them togethe

 to walk by the side of this child, and talk to and question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or would have been the most natural, had she been acting just then without design; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead, without any obligation of waiting for her. she gained on them, however, involuntarily: the childâ€™s pace was quick, and theirs rather slow; and she was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them. mr. elton was speaking with animation, harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and emma, having sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged to join them.
mr. elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail; and emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterdayâ€™s party at his friend coleâ€™s, and that she was come in he

â€œpart of my lace is gone,â€ said she, â€œand i do not know how i am to contrive. i really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but i hope i am not often so ill-equipped. mr. elton, i must beg leave to stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string, or any thing just to keep my boot on.â€
mr. elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. the room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door between

 them was open, and emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner. she was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that mr. elton should close it. it was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room. for ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself. it could be protracted no longer. she was then obliged to be finished, and make her appearance.
the lovers were standing together at one of the windows. it had a most favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, emma felt the glory

and had purposely followed them; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing serious.
â€œcautious, very cautious,â€ thought emma; â€œhe advances inch by inch, and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.â€
still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading them forward to the great event.




chapter xi

mr. elton must now be left to himself. it was no longer in emmaâ€™s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. the coming of her sisterâ€™s family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth her prime object of interest; and during the ten days of their stay at hartfield it was not to be expectedâ€”she did not herself expectâ€”that any thing beyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers. they might adva

alls one day;â€”even mr. woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party.
how they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if he could, but as his son and daughterâ€™s carriage and horses were actually at hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for harriet also.
harriet, mr. elton, and mr. knightley, their own especial set, were the only persons invited to meet them;â€”the hours were to be early, as well as the numbers few; mr. woodhouseâ€™s habits and inclination being consulted in every thing.
the evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that mr. woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of december) had been spent by harriet at hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by mrs.

 and found her doom already signed with regard to randalls. she was very feverish and had a bad sore throat: mrs. goddard was full of care and affection, mr. perry was talked of, and harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement, though she could not speak of her loss without many tears.
emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in mrs. goddardâ€™s unavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much mr. eltonâ€™s would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her at last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much. she had not advanced many yards from mrs. goddardâ€™s door, when she was met by mr. elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalidâ€”of whom he, on the rumour of considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he might carry some

lowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for. they joined company and proceeded together. emma was just describing the nature of her friendâ€™s complaint;â€”â€œa throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat about her, a quick, low pulse, &c. and she was sorry to find from mrs. goddard that harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often alarmed her with them.â€ mr. elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as he exclaimed,
â€œa sore-throat!â€”i hope not infectious. i hope not of a putrid infectious sort. has perry seen her? indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend. let me entreat you to run no risks. why does not perry see her?â€
emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of mrs. goddardâ€™s experience and care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which sh

â€œit is so cold, so very coldâ€”and looks and feels so very much like snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, i should really try not to go out to-dayâ€”and dissuade my father from venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel the cold himself, i do not like to interfere, as i know it would be so great a disappointment to mr. and mrs. weston. but, upon my word, mr. elton, in your case, i should certainly excuse myself. you appear to me a little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring, i think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night.â€
mr. elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make; which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of herâ€™s, he had

â€œyou do quite right,â€ said she;â€”â€œwe will make your apologies to mr. and mrs. weston.â€
but hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were mr. eltonâ€™s only objection, and mr. elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction. it was a done thing; mr. elton was to go, and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment; never had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her.
â€œwell,â€ said she to herself, â€œthis is most strange!â€”after i had got him off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave harriet ill behind!â€”most strange indeed!â€”but ther

soon afterwards mr. elton quitted them, and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice while assuring her th

after a few minutes of entire silence between them, john knightley began withâ€”
â€œi never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than mr. elton. it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. with men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to please, every feature works.â€
â€œmr. eltonâ€™s manners are not perfect,â€ replied emma; â€œbut where there is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a great deal. where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he will have the advantage over negligent superiority. there is such perfect good-temper and good-will in mr. elton as one cann

â€œyes,â€ said mr. john knightley presently, with some slyness, â€œhe seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you.â€
â€œme!â€ she replied with a smile of astonishment, â€œare you imagining me to be mr. eltonâ€™s object?â€
â€œsuch an imagination has crossed me, i own, emma; and if it never occurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.â€
â€œmr. elton in love with me!â€”what an idea!â€
â€œi do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. i think your manners to him encouraging. i speak as a friend, emma. you had better look about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.â€

they arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and mr. elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject. mr. elton was all obligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed, that she began to think he must have received a different account of harriet from what had reached her. she had sent while dressing, and the answer had been, â€œmuch the sameâ€”not better.â€

at another time emma might have been amused, but she was too much astonished now at mr. eltonâ€™s spirits for other feelings. harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.
â€œwe are sure of excellent fires,â€ continued he, â€œand every thing in the greatest comfort. charming people, mr. and mrs. weston;â€”mrs. weston indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so hospitable, and so fond of society;â€”it will be a small party, but where small parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any. mr. westonâ€™s dining-room does not

chapter xiv

some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into mrs. westonâ€™s drawing-room;â€”mr. elton must compose his joyous looks, and mr. john knightley disperse his ill-humour. mr. elton must smile less, and mr. john knightley more, to fit them for the place.â€”emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as happy as she was. to her it was real enjoyment to be with the westons. mr. weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not any one, to whom she related with such conviction of being listen

n which mrs. weston had not a lively concern; and half an hourâ€™s uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.
this was a pleasure which perhaps the whole dayâ€™s visit might not afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but the very sight of mrs. weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was grateful to emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of mr. eltonâ€™s oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost.
the misfortune of harrietâ€™s cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival. mr. woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it, besides all the history of his own and isabellaâ€™s coming, and of emmaâ€™s being to follow, and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that james should come and see his daughter, when the others appeared, and mrs. weston, who

 had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away and welcome her dear emma.
emmaâ€™s project of forgetting mr. elton for a while made her rather sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close to her. the difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion. instead of forgetting him, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of â€œcan it really be as my brother imagin

out her father, and so delighted with mrs. weston; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners. for her own sake she could not be rude; and for harrietâ€™s, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even positively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was going on amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of mr. eltonâ€™s nonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to. she heard enough to know that mr. weston was giving some information about his son; she heard the words â€œmy son,â€ and â€œfrank,â€ and â€œmy son,â€ repeated several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son; but before she could quiet mr. elton, the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward.

with such sensations, mr. eltonâ€™s civilities were dreadfully ill-timed; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very crossâ€”and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again, or the substance of it, from the open-hearted mr. weston.â€”so it proved;â€”for when happily released from mr. elton, and seated by mr. weston, at dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddl

chapter xv

mr. woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three companions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. mr. weston was chatty and convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. mr. elton, in very good spirits, was one of the first to walk in. mrs. weston and emma were sitting together on a sofa. he joined them immediately, and, with scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.
emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of mr. frank churchill, was willing to forget his late improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on his making harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with most friendly smiles.

she had not time to know how mr. elton took the reproof, so rapidly did another subject succeed; for mr. john knightley now came into the room from examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing fast, with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to mr. woodhouse:

isabella stept in after her father; john knightley, forgetting that he did not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally; so that emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by mr. elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them, and that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive. it would not have been the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure, previous to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked to him of harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but one. but now, she would rather it had not happened. she believed he had been drinking too much of mr. westonâ€™s good wine, and felt sure that he would want to be talking n

to restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had they passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she found her subject cut upâ€”her hand seizedâ€”her attention demanded, and mr. elton actually making violent love to her: availing himself of the precious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well known, hopingâ€”fearingâ€”adoringâ€”ready to die if she refused him; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short, very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible. it really was so. without scrupleâ€”without apologyâ€”without much apparent diffidence

â€œmr. elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and i can account for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak either to me, or of harriet, in such a manner. command yourself enough to say no more, and i will endeavour to forget it.â€

as she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness, replied,
â€œit is impossible for me to doubt any longer. you have made yourself too clear. mr. elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing i can express. after such behaviour, as i have witnessed during the last month, to miss smithâ€”such attentions as i have been in the daily habit of observingâ€”to be addressing me in this mannerâ€”this is an unsteadiness of character, indeed, which i had not supposed possible! believe me, sir, i am far, very far, from gratified in being the object of such professions.â€

â€œcharming miss woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting silence. it confesses that you have long understood me.â€
â€œno, sir,â€ cried emma, â€œit confesses no such thing. so far from having long understood you, i have been in a most complete error with respect to your views, till this moment. as to myself, i am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelingsâ€”nothing could be f

to mr. john knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject, for the first start of its possibility. there was no denying that those brothers had penetration. she remembered what mr. knightley had once said to her about mr. elton, the caution he had given, the conviction he had professed that mr. elton would never marry indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself. it was dreadfully mortifying; but mr. elton was proving himself, in many respects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him; proud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and little concerned about the feelings of others.

rse of things, mr. eltonâ€™s wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. his professions and his proposals did him no service. she thought nothing of his attachment, and was insulted by his hopes. he wanted to marry well, and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for. there had been no real affection either in his language or manners. sighs and fine words had been given in abun

perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. the very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior. he must know that the woodhouses had been settled for several generations at hartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient familyâ€”and that the eltons were nobody. the landed property of hartfield certainly was inconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the donwell abbey estate, to which all the rest of highbury belonged; but their fortune, from other sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to donwell abbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which mr. elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way as he could, without a

the first error and the worst lay at her door. it was foolish, it was wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. it was adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what ought to be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. she was quite concerned and ashamed, and reso

emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her, and to depend on getting tolerably out of it.
it was a great consolation that mr. elton should not be really in love with her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint himâ€”that harrietâ€™s nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentiveâ€”and that there could be no necessity for any bodyâ€™s knowing what had passed except the three principals, and especially for her fatherâ€™s being given a momentâ€™s uneasiness about it.
these were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did

it was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other, it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house, too wise to stir out; and to hear him say to mr. knightley, whom no weather could keep entirely from them,â€”
â€œah! mr. knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor mr. elton?â€

the evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from mr. elton to mr. woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note, to say, with mr. eltonâ€™s best compliments, â€œthat he was proposing to leave highbury the following morning in his way to bath; where, in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends, he had engaged to spend a few weeks, and very much regretted the impossibility he was under, from various circumstances of weather and business, of taking a personal leave of mr. woodhouse, of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful

emma was most agreeably surprized.â€”mr. eltonâ€™s absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired. she admired him for contriving it, though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced. resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father, from which she was so pointedly excluded. she had not even a share in his opening compliments.â€”her name was not mentioned;â€”and there was so striking a change in all this, and such an ill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his gr

she now resolved to keep harriet no longer in the dark. she had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was desirable that she should have

harriet bore the intelligence very wellâ€”blaming nobodyâ€”and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself, as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend.
emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost; and all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching, seemed on harrietâ€™s side, not her own. harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of. the affection of such a man as mr. elton would have been too great a distinction.â€”she never could have deserved himâ€”and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as miss woodhouse would have thought it possible.
her tears fell abundantlyâ€”but her grief was so truly artless, that no dignity could have made it more respectable in emmaâ€™s eyesâ€”and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understandingâ€”really for the time convinced that harriet was the superior creature of the twoâ€”and that to resemble

time, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general, and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to mr. elton in particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at harrietâ€™s age, and with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of mr. eltonâ€™s return, as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine

harriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence of any body equal to him in person or goodnessâ€”and did, in truth, prove herself more resolutely in love than emma had foreseen; but yet it appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort unrequited, that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force.
if mr. elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do, she could not imagine harrietâ€™s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him.
their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad for each, for all three. not one of them had the power of removal, or of effecting any material change of society. they must encounter each other, and make the best of it.

emma and harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in emmaâ€™s opinion, had been talking enough of mr. elton for that day. she could not think that harrietâ€™s solace or her own sins required more; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned;â€”but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded, and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter, and receiving no other answer than a very plaintiveâ€”â€œmr. elton is so good to the poor!â€ she found something else must be done.

the mention of the coles was sure to be followed by that of mr. elton. there was intimacy between them, and mr. cole had heard from mr. elton since his going away. emma knew what was coming; they must have the letter over again, and settle how long he had been gone, and how much he was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever he went, and how full the master of the ceremoniesâ€™ ball had been; and she went through it very well, with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite, and always putting forward to prevent harrietâ€™s

â€œoh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? my dear miss woodhouseâ€”i come quite over-powered. such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork! you are too bountiful! have you heard the news? mr. elton is going to be married.â€
emma had not had time even to think of mr. elton, and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start, and a little blush, at the sound.
â€œthere is my news:â€”i thought it would interest you,â€ said mr. knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them.

â€œhe is very young to settle,â€ was mr. woodhouseâ€™s observation. â€œhe had better not be in a hurry. he seemed to me very well off as he was. we were always glad to see him at hartfield.â€
â€œa new neighbour for us all, miss woodhouse!â€ said miss bates, joyfully; â€œmy mother is so pleased!â€”she says she cannot bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress.

mr. eltonâ€™s rights, however, gradually revived. though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before, or an hour before, its interest soon increased; and before their first conversation was over, she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity, wonder and regret, pain and pleasure, as to this fortunate miss hawkins, which could conduce to place the martins under proper subordination in her fancy.

human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations, that a young person, who either marries or dies, is sure of being kindly spoken of.
a week had not passed since miss hawkinsâ€™s name was first mentioned in highbury, before she was, by some means or other, discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind; to be handsome, elegant, highly accomplished, and perfectly amiable: and when mr. elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects, and circulate the fame of her merits, there was very little more for him to do, than to tell her christian name, and say whose music she principally played.
mr. elton returned, a very happy man. he had gone away rejected and mortifiedâ€”disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing the right lady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one. he had gone aw

agreeable feelings, that, except in a moral light, as a penance, a lesson, a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind, she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again. she wished him very well; but he gave her pain, and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction.
the pain of his continued residence in highbury, however, must certainly be lessened by his marriage. many vain solicitudes would be preventedâ€”many awkwardnesses smoothed by it. a mrs. elton would be an excuse for any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink without remark. it would be almost beginning their life of civility again.
of the lady, individually, emma thought very little. she was good enough for mr. elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for highburyâ€”handsome enoughâ€”to look plain, probably, by harrietâ€™s side. as to connexion, there emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of harriet, he had done nothing. on that

nto love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be talked out of it. the charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of harrietâ€™s mind was not to be talked away. he might be superseded by another; he certainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a robert martin would have been sufficient; but nothing else, she feared, would cure her. harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be always in love. and now, poor girl! she was considerably worse from this reappearance of mr. elton. she was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other. emma saw him only once; but two or three times every day harriet was sure just to meet with him, or just to miss him, just to hear his voice, or see his shoulder, just to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy, in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture. she was, moreover, perpetually hearing about him; for, excepting when at hartfield, she was always among those who saw no fault in mr. elton, and found nothing s

had it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to her friend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of harrietâ€™s mind, emma would have been amused by its variations. sometimes mr. elton predominated, sometimes the martins; and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other. mr. eltonâ€™s engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting mr. martin. the unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by elizabeth martinâ€™s calling at mrs. goddardâ€™s a few days afterwards. harriet had not been at home; but a note had been prepared and left for her, written in the very style to touch; a small mixture of reproach, with a great de

how that visit was to be acknowledgedâ€”what would be necessaryâ€”and what might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful consideration. absolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, would be ingratitude. it must

small heart had harriet for visiting. only half an hour before her friend called for her at mrs. goddardâ€™s, her evil stars had led her to the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to the rev. philip elton, white-hart, bath, was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcherâ€™s cart, which was to convey it to where the coaches past; and every thing in this world, excepting that trunk and the direction, was consequently a blank.
she went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to be put down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led between espalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn be

it was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that neither â€œmaster nor mistress was at home;â€ they had both been out some time; the man believed they were gone to hartfield.
â€œthis is too bad,â€ cried emma, as they turned away. â€œand now we shall just miss them; too provoking!â€”i do not know when i have been so disappointed.â€ and she leaned back in the corner, to indulge her murmurs, or to reason them

mr. weston gave her the history of the engagements at enscombe, which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command, as well as the route and the method of his journey; and she listened, and smiled, and congratulated.
â€œi shall soon bring him over to hartfield,â€ said he, at the conclusion.
emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from his wife.

he perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long, and thinking so much alike, emma felt herself so well acquainted with him, that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting. he was not exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the world in some of his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, therefore better than she had expected. his ideas seemed more moderateâ€”his feelings warmer. she was particularly struck by his manner of considering mr. eltonâ€™s house, which, as well as the church, he would go and look at, and would not join them in finding much fault with. no, he could not believe it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having. if it were to be shared with the woman he loved, he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house. there must be ample room in it for every real comfort. the man must be a blockhead who wanted more.

she meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at mr. coleâ€™s; and without being able to forget that among the failings of mr. elton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with mr. cole.
her fatherâ€™s comfort was amply secured, mrs. bates as well as mrs. goddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty, before she left the house, was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her power, by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses o

in so large a party it was not necessary that emma should approach her. she did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much in the secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair, and therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, the subject was almost immediately introduced, and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulati

smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards miss fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech. he told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-roomâ€”hated sitting longâ€”was always the first to move when he couldâ€”that his father, mr. knightley, mr. cox, and mr. cole, were left very busy over parish businessâ€”that as long as he had staid, however, it had been ple

it was well to have a comfort in store on harrietâ€™s behalf, though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that quarter was at hand. as frank churchillâ€™s arrival had succeeded mr. eltonâ€™s engagement in the conversation of highbury, as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first, so now upon frank churchillâ€™s disappearance, mr. eltonâ€™s concerns were assuming the most irresistible form.â€”his wedding-day was named. he would soon be among them again; mr. elton and his bride. there was hardly time to talk over the first letter from enscombe before â€œmr. elton and his brideâ€ was in every bodyâ€™s mouth, and frank churchill was forgotten. emma grew sick at the sou

â€œyour allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about mr. eltonâ€™s marrying, harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make me. you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i fell into. it was all my doing, i know. i have not forgotten it, i assure you.â€”deceived myself, i did very miserably deceive youâ€”and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever. do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it.â€

chapter xiv

mrs. elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might be interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, to settle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, or not pretty at all.
emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and she made a point of harrietâ€™s going with her, that the worst of the business mig

she did not really like her. she would not be in a hurry to find fault, but she suspected that there was no elegance;â€”ease, but not elegance.â€” she was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride, there was too much ease. her person was rather good; her face not unpretty; but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner, were elegant. emma thought at least it would turn out so.
as for mr. elton, his manners did not appearâ€”but no, she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners. it was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it. the woman was better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes, and the privilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own good sense to depend on; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor mr. elton was in being in the sam

when the visit was returned, emma made up her mind. she could then see more and judge better. from harrietâ€™s happening not to be at hartfield, and her fatherâ€™s being present to engage mr. elton, she had a quarter of an hour of the ladyâ€™s conversation to herself, and could composedly attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that mrs. elton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied with herself, and thinking much of her own importance; that she meant to shine and be very superior, but with manners which had been formed in a bad school, pert and familiar; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people, and one style of living; that if not foolish she was i

gnorant, and that her society would certainly do mr. elton no good.
harriet would have been a better match. if not wise or refined herself, she would have connected him with those who were; but miss hawkins, it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best of her own set. the rich brother-in-law near bristol was the pride of the alliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride of him.
the very first subject after being seated was maple grove, â€œmy brother mr. sucklingâ€™s seat;â€â€”a comparison of hartfield to maple grove.

 the grounds of hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house was modern and well-built. mrs. elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she could see or imagine. â€œvery like maple grove indeed!â€”she was quite struck by the likeness!â€”that room was the very shape and size of the morning-room at maple grove; her sisterâ€™s favourite room.â€â€”mr. elton was appealed to.â€”â€œwas not it astonishingly like?â€”she could really almost fancy herself at maple grove.â€
â€œand the staircaseâ€”you know, as i came in, i observed how very like the staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. i really could not help exclaiming! i assure you, miss woodhouse, it is very delightful to me, to be reminded of a place i am so extremely partial to as maple grove. i have spent so many happy months there!

emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient for mrs. elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.
â€œso extremely like maple grove! and it is not merely the houseâ€”the grounds, i assure you, as far as i could observe, are strikingly like. the laurels at maple grove are in the same profusion as here, and stand very much in the same wayâ€”just across the lawn; and i had a glimpse of a fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly in mind! my brother and sister will be enchanted with this place. people who have extensive grounds themse

â€œwhen you have seen more of this country, i am afraid you will think you have overrated hartfield. surry is full of beauties.â€
â€œoh! yes, i am quite aware of that. it is the garden of england, you know. surry is the garden of england.â€
â€œyes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. many counties, i believe, are called the garden of england, as well as surry.â€
â€œno, i fancy not,â€ replied mrs. elton, with a most satisfied smile. â€œi never heard any county but surry called so.â€
emma was silenced.
â€œmy brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, or summer at farthest,â€ continued mrs. elton; â€œand that will be our time for exploring. while they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, i dare say. they will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds four perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of our carriage, we should be able to explore the differe

it was as much as emma could bear, without being impolite. the idea of her being indebted to mrs. elton for what was called an introductionâ€”of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of mrs. eltonâ€™sâ€”probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!â€”the dignity of miss woodhouse, of hartfield, was sunk indeed!
she restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could have given, and only thanked mrs. elton coolly; â€œbut their going to bath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place

â€œi do not ask whether you are musical, mrs. elton. upon these occasions, a ladyâ€™s character generally precedes her; and highbury has long known that you are a superior performer.â€
â€œoh! no, indeed; i must protest against any such idea. a superior performer!â€”very far from it, i assure you. consider from how partial a quarter your information came. i am doatingly fond of musicâ€”passionately fond;â€”and my friends say i am not entirely devoid of taste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is mediocre to the last degree.

â€œwe cannot suppose,â€ said emma, smiling, â€œthat mr. elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a very musical society in highbury; and i hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned, in consideration of the motive.â€
â€œno, indeed, i have no doubts at all on that head. i am delighted to find myself in such a circle. i hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together. i think, miss woodhouse, you and i must establish a musical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours. will not it be a g

â€œwell,â€ said mrs. elton, laughing, â€œwe shall see.â€
emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music, had nothing more to say; and, after a momentâ€™s pause, mrs. elton chose another subject.

â€œmrs. westonâ€™s manners,â€ said emma, â€œwere always particularly good. their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest model for any young woman.â€

there was no reason to suppose mr. elton thought at all differently from his wife. he seemed not merely happy with her, but proud. he had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to highbury, as not even miss woodhouse could equal; and the greater part of her new acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of judging, following the lead of miss batesâ€™s good-will, or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself, were very well satisfied; so that mr

in one respect mrs. elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first. her feelings altered towards emma.â€”offended, probably, by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with, she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant; and though the effect was agreeable, the ill-will which produced it was necessarily increasing emmaâ€™s dislike. her manners, tooâ€”and mr. eltonâ€™s, were unpleasant towards harriet. they were sneering and negligent. emma hoped it must rapidly work

mrs. elton took a great fancy to jane fairfax; and from the first. not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admirationâ€”but without solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting to assist and befriend her.â€”before emma had forfeited her confidence, and about the third time of their meeting, she heard all mrs. eltonâ€™s knight-errantry on the subje

she looked on with some amusement.â€”miss batesâ€™s gratitude for mrs. eltonâ€™s attentions to jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth. she was quite one of her worthiesâ€”the most amiable, affable, delightful womanâ€”just as accomplished and condescending as mrs. elton meant to be considered. emmaâ€™s only surprize was that jane fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate mrs. elton as she seemed to do. she heard of her walking with the eltons, sitting with the eltons, spending a day with the eltons! this was astonishing!â€”she could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of miss fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the vicarage had to offer.
â€œshe is a riddle, quite a riddle!â€ said she.â€”â€œto chuse to remain her

jane had come to highbury professedly for three months; the campbells were gone to ireland for three months; but now the campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till midsummer, and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there. according to miss batesâ€”it all came from herâ€”mrs. dixon had written most pressingly

â€œshe must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing this invitation,â€ was emmaâ€™s conclusion. â€œshe must be under some sort of penance, inflicted either by the campbells or herself. there is great fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.â€”she is not to be with the dixons. the decree is issued by somebody. but why must she consent to be with the eltons?â€”here is quite a separate puzzle.â€
upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before the few who knew her opinion of mrs. elton, mrs. weston ventured this apology for jane.
â€œwe cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage, my dear emmaâ€”but it is better than being always at home. her aunt is a good creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. we must consider what miss fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste for what she goes

â€œyou are right, mrs. weston,â€ said mr. knightley warmly, â€œmiss fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs. elton. could she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have chosen her. but (with a reproachful smile at emma) she receives attentions from mrs. elton, which nobody else pays her.â€
emma felt that mrs. weston was giving her a momentary glance; and she was herself struck by his warmth. with a faint blush, she presently replied,
â€œsuch attentions as mrs. eltonâ€™s, i should have imagined, would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax. mrs. eltonâ€™s invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting.â€

both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few minutes silence, he said,
â€œanother thing must be taken into consideration tooâ€”mrs. elton does not talk to miss fairfax as she speaks of her. we all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest spoken amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each otherâ€”a something more early implanted. we cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before. we feel things differently. and besides the operation of this, as a general principle, you may be sure t

â€œi know how highly you think of jane fairfax,â€ said emma. little henry was in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say.

â€œyes, very soon. he gave me a quiet hint; i told him he was mistaken; he asked my pardon and said no more. cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours.â€
â€œin that respect how unlike dear mrs. elton, who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world! i wonder how she speaks of the colesâ€”what she calls them! how can she find any appellation for them, deep enough in familiar vulgarity? she calls you, knightleyâ€”what can she do for mr. cole? and so i am not to be surprized that jane fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her. mrs. weston, your argument weighs most with me. i can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from miss bates, than i can belie

chapter xvi

every body in and about highbury who had ever visited mr. elton, was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage. dinner-parties and evening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day.
â€œi see how it is,â€ said she. â€œi see what a life i am to lead among you. upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. we really seem quite the fashion. if this is living in the country, it is nothing very formidable. from monday next to saturday, i

ew them how every thing ought to be arranged. in the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior partyâ€”in which her card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true styleâ€”and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.
emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner at hartfield for the eltons. they must not do less than others, or she should be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitiful resentment. a dinner there must be. after emma had talked about it for ten minutes, mr. woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself, with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him.
the persons to be invited, required little thought. besides the eltons, it must be the westons and mr.

â€œthis is very true,â€ said she, â€œat least as far as relates to me, which was all that was meantâ€”and it is very shameful.â€”of the same ageâ€”and always knowing herâ€”i ought to have been more her friend.â€”she will never like me now. i have neglected her too long. but i will shew her greater attention than i have done.â€

 the evening, but certainly not to dinner. mr. woodhouse was quite at ease; and the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate, removed the chief of even emmaâ€™s vexation.
the day came, the party were punctually assembled, and mr. john knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable. instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner, he was talking to miss fairfax. mrs. elton, as elegant as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in silenceâ€”wanting only to observe enough for isabellaâ€™s informationâ€”but miss fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could talk to her. he had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys, when it had been just beginning to rain. it was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and he said,
â€œi hope you did not venture far, miss fairfax, this morning, or i am sure you mus

the kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.
by this time, the walk in the rain had reached mrs. elton, and her remonstrances now opened upon jane.
â€œmy dear jane, what is this i hear?â€”going to the post-office in the rain!â€”this must not be, i assure you.â€”you sad girl, how could you do such a thing?â€”it is a sign i was not there to take care of you.â€
jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.
â€œoh! do not tell me. you really are a very sad girl, and do not know how to take care of yourself.â€”to the post-office indeed! mrs. weston, did you ever hear the like? you

â€œoh! she shall not do such a thing again,â€ eagerly rejoined mrs. elton. â€œwe will not allow her to do such a thing again:â€â€”and nodding significantlyâ€”â€œthere must be some arrangement made, there must indeed. i shall speak to mr. e. the man who fetches our letters every morning (one of our men, i forget his name) shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you. that will obviate all difficulties you know; and from us i really think, my dear jane, you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation.â€

â€œwell, well, i have that note; and can shew it after dinner to convince mr. knightley.â€

â€œmust i go first? i really am ashamed of always leading the way.â€
janeâ€™s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped emma. she had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any. she suspected that it had; that it would not have been so resolutely enc

chapter xvii

when the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;â€”with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did mrs. elton engross jane fairfax and slight herself. she and mrs. weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together. mrs. elton left them no choice. if jane repressed her for a little time, she soon began again; and though much that passed between them was in a half-whisper, especially on mrs. eltonâ€™s side, there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects: the post-officeâ€”catching coldâ€”fetching lettersâ€”and friendship, were long under discussion; and to

â€œbut i have never fixed on june or any other monthâ€”merely looked forward to the summer in general.â€

â€œsomething that would do!â€ repeated mrs. elton. â€œaye, that may suit your humble ideas of yourself;â€”i know what a modest creature you are; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation, in a family not moving in a certain circle, or able to command the elegancies of life.â€

â€œand i am quite serious too, i assure you,â€ replied mrs. elton gaily, â€œin resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends to watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us.â€
in this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till mr. woodhouse came into the room;

it was well that he took every bodyâ€™s joy for granted, or he might not have thought either mr. woodhouse or mr. knightley particularly delighted. they were the first entitled, after mrs. weston and emma, to be made happy;â€”from them he would have proceeded to miss fairfax, but she was so deep in conversation with john knightley, that it would have been too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to mrs. elton, and her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subject with her.

mrs. elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope, smiled most graciously.

â€œaye, we men are sad fellows. you must take care of yourself, mrs. elton.â€”this letter tells usâ€”it is a short letterâ€”written in a hurry, merely to give us noticeâ€”it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly, on mrs. churchillâ€™s accountâ€”she has not been well the whole winter, and thinks enscombe too cold for herâ€”so they are all to move southward without loss of time.â€

â€œis not she? then she is no rule for mrs. churchill, who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld.â€

a very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy emma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of frank churchill. she was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him. her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;â€”but if he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two, were to be ret

emma found that it was not mr. westonâ€™s fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger. they had stopped at mrs. batesâ€™s door to offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the eltons.
frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness, which shewed a mind not at ease. he was looking about, he was going to the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,â€”impatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her.
mrs. elton was spoken of. â€œi think she must be here soon,â€ said he. â€œi have a great curiosity to see mrs. elton, i have heard so much of her. it cannot be long, i think, before she comes.â€

â€œi am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her. i have never seen either mr. or mrs. elton. i have no business to put myself forward.â€
mr. and mrs. elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed.
â€œbut miss bates and miss fairfax!â€ said mr. weston, looking about. â€œwe thought you were to bring them.â€
the mistake had been slight. the carriage was sent for them now. emma longed to know what frankâ€™s first opinion of mrs. elton might be; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and her smiles of graciousness. he was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion, by giving her very proper attention, after the introduction had passed.
in a few minutes the carriage returned.â€”somebody talked of rain.â€”â€œi will see that there are umbrellas, sir,â€ said frank to his father: â€œmiss bates must not be forgotten:â€ and away he went. mr. weston was following; but mrs. elton detained him, to gratify hi

while she talked of his son, mr. westonâ€™s attention was chained; but when she got to maple grove, he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.
mrs. elton turned to mrs. weston. â€œi have no doubt of its being our carriage with miss bates and jane. our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious!â€”i believe we drive faster than any body.â€”what a pleasure it is to send oneâ€™s carriage for a friend!â€”i understand you were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite unnecessary. you may be very sure i shall always take care of them.â€
miss bates and miss fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into the room; and mrs. elto

frank churchill returned to his station by emma; and as soon as miss bates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of mrs. elton and miss fairfax, who were standing a little way behind her.â€”he was thoughtful. whether he were overhearing too, she could not determine. after a good many compliments to jane on her dress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, mrs. elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herselfâ€”and it was, â€œhow do you like my gown?â€”how do you like my trimming?â€”how has wright done my hair?â€â€”with many other relative questions, all answered with patient politeness. mrs. elton

at this moment frank began talking so vigorously, that emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want to hear more;â€”and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, till another suspension brought mrs. eltonâ€™s tones again distinctly forward.â€”mr. elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,
â€œoh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?â€”i was this moment telling jane, i thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us.â€
â€œjane!â€â€”repeated frank churchill, with a look of surprize and displeasure.â€”â€œthat is easyâ€”but miss fairfax does not disapprove it, i suppose.â€
â€œhow do you like mrs. elton?â€ said emma in a whisper.
â€œnot at all.â€

emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. he walked off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both mr. and mrs. weston. he had met with them in a little perplexity, which must be laid before emma. it had just occurred to mrs. weston that mrs. elton must be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving emma that distinction.â€”emma heard the sad truth with fortitude.
â€œand what are we to do for a proper partner for her?â€ said mr. weston. â€œshe will think frank ought to ask her.â€
frank turned instantly to emma, to claim her former promise; and boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfect approbation ofâ€”and it then appeared that mrs. weston was wanting

iven in the very beginning of the existence of this. of very important, very recordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings usually are. there was one, however, which emma thought something of.â€”the two last dances before supper were begun, and harriet had no partner;â€”the only young lady sitting down;â€”and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers, that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder!â€”but emmaâ€™s wonder lessened soon afterwards, on seeing mr. elton sauntering about. he would not ask harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided: she was sure he would notâ€”and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card-room.
escape, however, was not his plan. he came to the part of the room where the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in front of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution of maintaining it. he did not omit being sometimes directly before miss smith, or speaking to those who were close

to her.â€”emma saw it. she was not yet dancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, and had therefore leisure to look around, and by only turning her head a little she saw it all. when she was half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly behind her, and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but mr. elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and mrs. weston; and she perceived that his wife, who was standing immediately above her, was not only listening also, but even encouraging him by significant glances.â€”the kind-hearted, gentle mrs. weston had left her seat to join him and say, â€œdo not you dance, mr. elton?â€ to which his prompt reply was, â€œmost readily, mrs. weston, if you will dance with me.â€
â€œme!â€”oh! noâ€”i would get y

mrs. weston said no more; and emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat. this was mr. elton! the amiable, obliging, gentle mr. elton.â€”she looked round for a moment; he had joined mr. knightley at a little distance, and was arranging himself for settled conversation, while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife.
she would not look again. her heart was in a glow, and she feared her face might be as hot.
in another moment a happier sight caught her;â€”mr. knightley leading harriet to the set!â€”never had she been more surprized, seldom more delighted, than at that instant.

his dancing proved to be just what she had believed it, extremely good; and harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had not been for the cruel state of things before, and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced. it was not thrown away on her, she bounded higher than ever, flew farther down the middle, and was in a continual course of smiles.
mr. elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (emma trusted) very foolish. she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife, though growing very like her;â€”she spoke some of her feelings, by observing audibly to her partner,
â€œknightley has taken pity on poor little miss smith!â€”very good-natured, i declare.â€

emma had no opportunity of speaking to mr. knightley till after supper; but, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked. he was warm in his reprobation of mr. eltonâ€™s conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness; and mrs. eltonâ€™s looks also received the due share of censure.
â€œthey aimed at wounding more than harriet,â€ said he. â€œemma, why is it that they are your enemies?â€
he looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added, â€œshe ought not to be angry with you, i suspect, whatever he may be.â€”to that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, emma, that you did want him to marry harriet.â€
â€œi did,â€ replied emma, â

â€œnot your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.â€”if one leads you wrong, i am sure the other tells you of it.â€
â€œi do own myself to have been completely mistaken in mr. elton. there is a littleness about him which you discovered, and which i did not: and i was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet. it was through a series of strange blunders!â€
â€œand, in return for your acknowledging so much, i will do you the justice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself.â€”harriet smith has some first-rate qualities, which mrs. elton is totally without. an unpretending, single-minded, artless girlâ€”infinitely to be preferre

this little explanation with mr. knightley gave emma considerable pleasure. it was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.â€”she was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike; and his praise of harriet, his concession in her favour, was peculiarly gratifying. the impertinence of the eltons, which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked forward to another happy resultâ€”the cure of harrietâ€™s infatuation.â€”from harrietâ€™s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom, sh

e had strong hopes. it seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened, and she were enabled to see that mr. elton was not the superior creature she had believed him. the fever was over, and emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy. she depended on the evil feelings of the eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite.â€”harriet rational, frank churchill not too much in love, and mr. knightley not wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer must be before her!
she was not to see frank churchill this morning. he had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at hartfield, as he was to be at home by the middle of the day. she did not regret it.

in the few minutesâ€™ conversation which she had yet had with him, while harriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror, her naivete, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a sensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after harrietâ€™s own account had been given, he had expresse

â€œi do remember it,â€ cried emma; â€œi perfectly remember it.â€”talking about spruce-beer.â€”oh! yesâ€”mr. knightley and i both saying we liked it, and mr. eltonâ€™s seeming resolved to learn to like it too. i perfectly remember it.â€”stop; mr. knightley was standing just here, was not he? i have an idea he was standing just here.â€
â€œah! i do not know. i cannot recollect.â€”it is very odd, but i cannot recollect.â€”mr. elton was sitting here, i remember, much about where i am now.â€â€”
â€œwell, go on.â€

â€œbut, harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?â€”i have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be useful.â€
â€œi shall be happier to burn it,â€ replied harriet. â€œit has a disagreeable look to me. i must get rid of every thing.â€”there it goes, and there is an end, thank heaven! of mr. elton.â€
â€œand when,â€ thought emma, â€œwill there be a beginning of mr. churchill?â€
she had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had told no fortune, might be proved to have made harrietâ€™s.â€”about a fortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and quite undesignedly. emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which made the information she received more valuable. she merely said, in the c

emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a momentâ€™s debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,
â€œnever marry!â€”this is a new resolution.â€
â€œit is one that i shall never change, however.â€
after another short hesitation, â€œi hope it does not proceed fromâ€”i hope it is not in compliment to mr. elton?â€
â€œmr. elton indeed!â€ cried harriet indignantly.â€”â€œoh! noâ€â€”and emma could just catch the words, â€œso superior to mr. elton!â€
she then took a longer time for consideration. should she proceed no farther?â€”should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?â€”perhaps harriet might think her cold or angry if she did; or perhaps if she were totally silent, it might only drive harriet into asking her to hear too much; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been, such a

harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude. emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend. its tendency would be to raise and refine her mindâ€”and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation.




chapter v

in this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, june opened upon hartfield. to highbury in general it brought no material change. the eltons were still talking of a visit from the sucklings, and of the use to be made of their barouche-landau; and jane fairfax was still at her grandmotherâ€™s; and as the return of the campbells from ireland was again delayed, and august, instead of midsummer, fixed for it, she was likely to remain there full two months longer, provided at least she were able to defeat mrs. eltonâ€™s activity in her service, and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will.

r. knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with jane fairfax. he could not understand it; but there were symptoms of intelligence between themâ€”he thought so at leastâ€”symptoms of admiration on his side, which, having once observed, he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning, however he might wish to escape any of emmaâ€™s errors of imagination. she was not present when the suspicion first arose. he was dining with the randalls family, and jane, at the eltonsâ€™; and he had seen a look, more than a single look, at miss fairfax, which, from the admirer of miss woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place. when he was again in their company, he could not help remembering what he had seen; nor could he avoid observations which, unless it were like cowper and his fire at twilight,
â€œmyself creating what i saw,â€
brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking, of private understanding even, between frank churchill and jane.

 could enrich their intellectual stores at present. in the daily interchange of news, they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the sucklingsâ€™ coming had been united, such as the last accounts of mrs. churchill, whose health seemed every day to supply a different report, and the situation of mrs. weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child, as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it.
mrs. elton was very much disappointed. it was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade. her introductions and recommendations must all wait, and every projected party be still only talked of. so she thought at first;â€”but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off. why should not they explore to box hill though the sucklings did not come? they could go there again with them in the autumn. it was settled that they should go to box hill. that there was to be such a pa

rty had been long generally known: it had even given the idea of another. emma had never been to box hill; she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing, and she and mr. weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither. two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be done in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic parade of the eltons and the sucklings.
this was so very well understood between them, that emma could not but feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from mr. weston that he had been proposing to mrs. elton, as her brother and sister had failed her, that the two parties should unite, and go together; and that as mrs. elton had very readily acceded to it, so it was to be, if she had no objection. now, as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of mrs. elton, of which mr. weston must a

lready be perfectly aware, it was not worth bringing forward again:â€”it could not be done without a reproof to him, which would be giving pain to his wife; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of mrs. eltonâ€™s party! every feeling was offended; and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of mr. westonâ€™s temper.
â€œi am glad you approve of what i have done,â€ said he very comfortably. â€œbut i thought you would. such schemes as these are nothing without numbers. one cannot have too large a party. a large party secures its own amusement. and she is a good-natured woman after all. one could not leave her

emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.
it was now the middle of june, and the weather fine; and mrs. elton was growing impatient to name the day, and settle with mr. weston as to pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty. it might be weeks, it might be only a few days, before the horse were useable; but no preparations could be ventured on, and it was all melancholy stagnation. mrs. eltonâ€™s resources were inadequate to such an attack.
â€œis not this most vexatious, knightley?â€ she cried.â€”â€œand such weather for exploring!â€”these delays and disappointments are quite odious. what are we to do?â€”the year will wear away at this rate, and nothing done. before this time last year i assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from maple grove to kings weston.â€

they had a very fine day for box hill; and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in favour of a pleasant party. mr. weston directed the whole, officiating safely between hartfield and the vicarage, and every body was in good time. emma and harriet went together; miss bates and her niece, with the eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. mrs. weston remained with mr. woodhouse. nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there. seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency. there was a languor, a want of spirits, a want of union, which could not be got over. they separated too much into parties. the eltons walked together; mr. knightley took charge of miss bates and

at first it was downright dulness to emma. she had never seen frank churchill so silent and stupid. he said nothing worth hearingâ€”looked without seeingâ€”admired without intelligenceâ€”listened wit

some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. miss bates said a great deal; mrs. elton swelled at the idea of miss woodhouseâ€™s presiding; mr. knightleyâ€™s answer was the most distinct.
â€œis miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of?â€
â€œoh! no, noâ€â€”cried emma, laughing as carelessly as she couldâ€”â€œupon no account in the world. it is the very last thing i would stand the brunt of just now. let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of. i will not say quite all. there are one or two, perhaps, (glancing at mr. weston an

her mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured, in reply,
â€œvery true, my love, very true. exactly so, indeedâ€”quite unheard ofâ€”but some ladies say any thing. better pass it off as a joke. every body knows what is due to you.â€

â€œthis explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and mr. weston has done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every body else. perfection should not have come quite so soon.â€
â€œoh! for myself, i protest i must be excused,â€ said mrs. elton; â€œi really cannot attemptâ€”i am not at all fond of the sort of thing. i had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which i was not at all pleased with. i knew who it came from. an abominable puppy!â€”you know who i mean (nodding to her husband). these kind of things are very well at christmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but quite out of place, in my opinion, when one is exploring about the country in summer. miss woodhouse must excuse me. i am not one of those who have witty

â€œnow, maâ€™am,â€ said jane to her aunt, â€œshall we join mrs. elton?â€
â€œif you please, my dear. with all my heart. i am quite ready. i was ready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well. we shall soon overtake her. there she isâ€”no, thatâ€™s somebody else. thatâ€™s one of the ladies in the irish car party, not at all like her.â€”well, i declareâ€”â€

w tired at last of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost alone, and quite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her. the appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight; and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart, and the solicitude of mrs. elton to have her carriage first, were gladly endured, in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure. such another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people, she hoped never to be betrayed into again.
while waiting for the carriage, she found mr. knightley by her side. he looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,

â€œmrs. elton, i suppose, has been the person to whom miss fairfax owesâ€”â€
â€œyes, our good mrs. elton. the most indefatigable, true friend. she would not take a denial. she would not let jane say, â€˜no;â€™ for when jane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the very morning we were at donwell,) when jane first heard of it, she was quite decided against accepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention; exactly as you say, she had made up her mind to close with nothing till colonel camp

â€œmr. knightley was there too, was he?â€
â€œno, not mr. knightley; he declined it from the first; and though i thought he would come, because mrs. elton declared she would not let him off, he did not;â€”but my mother, and jane, and i, were all there, and a very agreeable evening we had. suc

â€œthank you, dear miss woodhouse. yes, indeed, there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it. except the sucklings and bragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberal and elegant, in all mrs. eltonâ€™s acquaintance. mrs. smallridge, a most delightful woman!â€”a style of living almost equal to maple groveâ€”and as to the children, except the little sucklings and little bragges, there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere. jane will be treated with such regard and kindness!â€”it will be nothing but pleasure, a life of pleasure.â€”and her salary!â€”i really cannot venture to name her salary to you, miss woodhouse. even you, used as you are to great sums, would hardly believe that so m

â€œyes; jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining. i was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to mrs. elton, and when mrs. elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it! it was before teaâ€”stayâ€”no, it could not be before tea, because we were just going to cardsâ€”and yet it was before tea, because i remember thinkingâ€”oh! no, now i recollect, now i have it; something happened before tea, but not that. mr. elton was called out of the room before tea, old john abdyâ€™s son wanted to speak with him. poor old john, i have a great regard for him; he was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven y

miss bates would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her; but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of mr. frank churchillâ€™s going, she proceeded to give them

â€œi am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so comfortably settled. mrs. elton is very good-natured and agreeable, and i dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be. i hope it is a dry situation, and that her health will be taken good care of. it ought to be a first object, as i am sure poor miss taylorâ€™s always was with me. you know, my dear, she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor was to us. and i hope she will be better off in one respect, and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long.â€

emma did not want to be classed with the mrs. eltons, the mrs. perrys, and the mrs. coles, who would force themselves anywhere; neither could she feel any right of preference herselfâ€”she submitted, therefore, and only questioned miss bates farther as to her nieceâ€™s appetite and diet, which she longed to be able to assist. on that subject p

â€œoh, dear,â€ cried harriet, â€œnow i recollect what you mean; but i was thinking of something very different at the time. it was not the gipsiesâ€”it was not mr. frank churchill that i meant. no! (with some elevation) i was thinking of a much more precious circumstanceâ€”of mr. knightleyâ€™s coming and asking me to dance, when mr. elton would not stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in the room. that was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity; that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth.â€
â€œgood god!â€ cried emma, â€œthis has been a most unfortunateâ€”most deplorable mistake!â€”what is to be done?â€

how harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to mr. knightley!â€”how she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!â€”but harriet was less humble, had fewer scruples than formerly.â€”her inferiority, whether of mind or situation, seemed little felt.â€”she had seemed more sensible of mr. eltonâ€™s being to stoop in marrying her, than she now seemed of mr. knightleyâ€™s.â€”alas! was not that her own doing too? who had been at pains to give harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?â€”who but herself had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible, and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?â€”if harriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too.

emma knew that he was now getting to the box hill party, and grew uncomfortable. her own behaviour had been so very improper! she was deeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look. it was all read, however, steadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and, excepting one momentary glance at her, instantly withdrawn, in the fear of giving painâ€”no remembrance of box hill seemed to exist.
â€œthere is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, the eltons,â€ was his next observation.â€”â€œhis feelings are natural.â€”what! actually resolve to break with him entirely!â€”she felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to eachâ€”she dissolved it.â€”what a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour!â€”well, he must be a most extraordinaryâ€”â€
â€œnay, nay, read on.â€”you will find how very much he suffers.â€

â€œi wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him.â€

 emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment. in such a party, harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment.
in time, of course, mr. knightley would be forgotten, that is, supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early. mr. knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;â€”not like mr. elton. mr. knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so truly considerate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshipped than now; and it really was too much to hope even of harriet, that she could be in love with more than three men in one year.

â€œthis is most kind, indeed!â€”miss woodhouse, it is impossible for me to expressâ€”i hope you will believeâ€”excuse me for being so entirely without words.â€
emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, if the sound of mrs. eltonâ€™s voice from the sitting-room had not checked her, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand.
mrs. bates and mrs. elton were together. miss bates was out, which accounted for the previous tranquillity. emma could have wished mrs. elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience with every body; and as mrs. elton met her with unusual graciousness, she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm.

he soon believed herself to penetrate mrs. eltonâ€™s thoughts, and understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being in miss fairfaxâ€™s confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people. emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face; and while paying her own compliments to mrs. bates, and appearing to attend to the good old ladyâ€™s replies, she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to miss fai

â€œyes, here i am, my good friend; and here i have been so long, that anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologise; but, the truth is, that i am waiting for my lord and master. he promised to join me here, and pay his respects to you.â€

â€œoh! no, it is a meeting at the crown, a regular meeting. weston and cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead.â€”i fancy mr. e. and knightley have every thing their own way.â€

â€œyour parish there was small,â€ said jane.
â€œupon my word, my dear, i do not know, for i never heard the subject talked of.â€
â€œbut it is proved by the smallness of the school, which i have heard you speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and mrs. bragge; the only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.â€

ver creature, thatâ€™s very true. what a thinking brain you have! i say, jane, what a perfect character you and i should make, if we could be shaken together. my liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection.â€”not that i presume to insinuate, however, that some people may not think you perfection already.â€”but hush!â€”not a word, if you please.â€
it seemed an unnecessary caution; jane was wanting to give her words, not to mrs. elton, but to miss woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw. the wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted, was very evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.
mr. elton made his appearance. his lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity.
â€œvery pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an encumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!â€”but you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. you knew i should not stir till my lord

mr. elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away. his civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering, and the walk he had had for nothing.
â€œwhen i got to donwell,â€ said he, â€œknightley could not be found. very odd! very unaccountable! after the note i sent him this morning, and the message he returned, that he should certainly be at home till one.â€

emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary, indeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.
â€œi cannot imagine,â€ said mrs. elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do,) â€œi cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you, of all people in the world! the very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten!â€”my dear mr. e., he must have left a message for you, i am sure he must.â€”not even knightley could be so very eccentric;â€”and his servants forgot it. depend upon it, that was the case: and very likely to happen with the donwell servants, who are all, i have often observed, extremely awkward and remiss

â€œi met william larkins,â€ continued mr. elton, â€œas i got near the house, and he told me i should not find his master at home, but i did not believe him.â€”william seemed rather out of humour. he did not know what was come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly ever get the speech of him. i have nothing to do with williamâ€™s wants, but it really is of very great importance that i should see knightley to-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore, of very serious inconvenience that i should have had this hot walk to no purpose.â€

emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly. in all probability she was at this very time waited for there; and mr. knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards mr. elton, if not towards william larkins.
she was pleased, on taking leave, to find miss fairfax determined to attend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of, to say,
â€œit is as well, perhaps, that i have not had the possibility. had you not been surrounded by other friends, i might have been tempted to introduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct.â€”i feel that i should certai

â€œimpossible!â€”i never can call you any thing but â€˜mr. knightley.â€™ i will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of mrs. elton, by calling you mr. k.â€”but i will promise,â€ she added presently, laughing and blushingâ€”â€œi will promise to call you once by your christian name. i do not say when, but perhaps you may guess where;â€”in the building in which n. takes m. for better, for worse.â€
emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her, to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly folliesâ€”her wilful intimacy

â€œit is to be a secret, i conclude,â€ said he. â€œthese matters are always a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them. only let me be told when i may speak out.â€”i wonder whether jane has any suspicion.â€
he went to highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on that point. he told her the news. was not she like a daughter, his eldest daughter?â€”he must tell her; and miss bates being present, it passed, of course, to mrs. cole, mrs. perry, and mrs. elton, immediately afterwards. it was no more than the principals were prepared for; they had calculated from the time of its being known at randalls, how soon it would be over highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as the evening wonder in many a family circle, with great sagacity.
in general, it was a very well approved match. some might think him, and others might think her, the most in luck. one set might recommend their all removing to donwell, and leaving hartfield for the john knightleys;

and another might predict disagreements among their servants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious objection raised, except in one habitation, the vicarage.â€”there, the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction. mr. elton cared little about it, compared with his wife; he only hoped â€œthe young ladyâ€™s pride would now be contented;â€ and supposed â€œshe had always meant to catch knightley if she could;â€ and, on the point of living at hartfield, could daringly exclaim, â€œrather he than i!â€â€”but mrs. elton was very much discomposed indeed.â€”â€œpoor knightley! poor fellow!â€”sad business for him.â€â€”she was extremely concerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good qualities.â€”how could he

inking so.â€”harrietâ€™s parentage became known. she proved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to have always wished for concealment.â€”such was the blood of gentility which emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!â€”it was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what a connexion had she been preparing for mr. knightleyâ€”or for the churchillsâ€”or even for mr. elton!â€”the stain of illegitimacy, unbleached by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.
no objection was raised on the fatherâ€™s side; the young man was treated liberally; it was all as it should be: and as emma became acquainted with robert martin, who was now introduced at hartfield, she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend. she had no doubt of harrietâ€™s happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, and

r engagements with the martins, was less and less at hartfield; which was not to be regretted.â€”the intimacy between her and emma must sink; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be, and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, natural manner.
before the end of september, emma attended harriet to church, and saw her hand bestowed on robert martin with so complete a satisfaction, as no remembrances, even connected with mr. elton as he stood before them, could impair.â€”perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw mr. elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself.â€”robert martin and harriet smith, the latest couple engaged of the three, were the first to be married.

en under wretched alarm every night of his life. the strength, resolution, and presence of mind of the mr. knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence. while either of them protected him and his, hartfield was safe.â€”but mr. john knightley must be in london again by the end of the first week in november.
the result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary, cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment, she was able to fix her wedding-dayâ€”and mr. elton was called on, within a month from the marriage of mr. and mrs. robert martin, to join the hands of mr. knightley and miss woodhouse.
the wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have no taste for finery or parade; and mrs. elton, from the particulars detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very inferior to her own.â€”â€œvery little white satin, very few lace veils; a most pitiful business!â€”selina would stare when she heard of it.â€â€”but, in spite o
