of the effect produced by these
incongruous words, in the midst of the general attention. it made
gringoire shudder as though it had been an electric shock. the prologue
stopped short, and all heads turned tumultuously towards the beggar,
who, far from being disconcerted by this, saw, in this incident, a good
opportunity for reaping his harvest, and who began to whine in a doleful
way, half closing his eyes the while,--“charity, please!”

“well--upon my soul,” resumed joannes, “it’s clopin trouillefou! holà
he, my friend, did your sore bother you on the leg, that you have
transferred it to your arm?” so saying, with the dexterity of a monkey,
he flung a bit of silver into the gray felt hat which the beggar held
in his ailing arm. the mendicant received both the alms and the sarcasm
without wincing, and continued, in lamentable tones,--

“charity, please!”

this episode considerably distracted the attention of the audience; and
a goodly number of spectators, among them robin poussepain

nd people were not a little amazed to see the flemish ambassador, on
concluding his inspection of the knave thus placed beneath his eyes,
bestow a friendly tap on that ragged shoulder. the beggar turned round;
there was surprise, recognition, a lighting up of the two countenances,
and so forth; then, without paying the slightest heed in the world to
the spectators, the hosier and the wretched being began to converse in a
low tone, holding each other’s hands, in the meantime, while the rags
of clopin trouillefou, spread out upon the cloth of gold of the dais,
produced the effect of a caterpillar on an orange.

the novelty of this singular scene excited such a murmur of mirth and
gayety in the hall, that the cardinal was not slow to perceive it; he
half bent forward, and, as from the point where he was placed he could
catch only an imperfect view of trouillerfou’s ignominious doublet,
he very naturally imagined that the mendicant was asking alms, and,
disgusted with his audacity, he exclaimed: “bail

 the people on all sides. that was, in
fact, a marvellous grimace which was beaming at that moment through the
aperture in the rose window. after all the pentagonal, hexagonal, and
whimsical faces, which had succeeded each other at that hole without
realizing the ideal of the grotesque which their imaginations, excited
by the orgy, had constructed, nothing less was needed to win their
suffrages than the sublime grimace which had just dazzled the assembly.

been among the competitors (and god knows what intensity of ugliness his
visage could attain), confessed himself conquered: we will do the same.
we shall not try to give the reader an idea of that tetrahedral nose,

bristling eyebrow, while the right eye disappeared entirely beneath an
enormous wart; of those teeth in disarray, broken here and there, like
the embattled parapet of a fortress; of that callous lip, up

 wretched headgear, it is true, but still good on a
sunny day or when there was but little rain. gringoire sighed.

meanwhile the king addressed him, from the summit of his cask,--

“who is this rogue?”

gringoire shuddered. that voice, although accentuated by menace,
recalled to him another voice, which, that very morning, had dealt the
deathblow to his mystery, by drawling, nasally, in the midst of the
audience, “charity, please!” he raised his head. it was indeed clopin
trouillefou.

clopin trouillefou, arrayed in his royal insignia, wore neither one rag
more nor one rag less. the sore upon his arm had already disappeared.
he held in his hand one of those whips made of thongs of white leather,
which police sergeants then used to repress the crowd, and which were
called _boullayes_. on his head he wore a sort of headgear, bound round
and closed at the top. but it was difficult to make out whether it was
a child’s cap or a king’s crown, the two things bore so strong a
resemblance to each ot

crescendo, and knowing neither how to mount higher, nor to descend

“monseigneur, his majesty, or comrade, call me what you please. but make
haste. what have you to say in your own defence?”

“in your own defence?” thought gringoire, “that displeases me.” he
resumed, stuttering, “i am he, who this morning--”

“by the devil’s claws!” interrupted clopin, “your name, knave, and
nothing more. listen. you are in the presence of three powerful
sovereigns: myself, clopin trouillefou, king of thunes, successor to the
grand coësre, supreme suzerain of the realm of argot; mathias hunyadi
spicali, duke of egypt and of bohemia, the old yellow fellow whom
you see yonder, with a dish clout round his head; guillaume rousseau,
emperor of galilee, that fat fellow who is not listening to us but
caressing a wench. we are your judges. you have entered the kingdom of
argot, without being an _argotier_; you have violated the privileges of
our city. you must be punished unless you are a

you have four minutes in which to fling your soul at his head.”

the harangue was formidable.

“well said, upon my soul! clopin trouillefou preaches like the holy
father the pope!” exclaimed the emperor of galilee, smashing his pot in
order to prop up his table.

“messeigneurs, emperors, and kings,” said gringoire coolly (for i know
not how, firmness had returned to him, and he spoke with resolution),
“don’t think of such a thing; my name is pierre gringoire. i am the
poet whose morality was presented this morning in the grand hall of the
courts.”

“ah! so it was you, master!” said clopin. “i was there, _xête die

moment!--listen to me--you are not going to condemn me without having

his unlucky voice was, in fact, drowned in the uproar which rose around
him. the little boy scraped away at his cauldron with more spirit than
ever; and, to crown all, an old woman had just placed on the tripod a
frying-pan of grease, which hissed away on the fire with a noise similar
to the cry of a troop of children in pursuit of a masker.

in the meantime, clopin trouillefou appeared to hold a momentary
conference with the duke of egypt, and the emperor of galilee, who
was completely drunk. then he shouted shrilly: “silence!” and, as the
cauldron and the frying-pan did not heed him, and continued their duet,
he jumped down from his hogshead, gave a kick to the boiler, which
rolled ten paces away bearing the child with it, a kick to the
frying-pan, which upset in the fire with all its grease, and gravely
remounted his throne, without troubling himself about the

trouillefou made a sign, and the duke, the emperor, and the passed
masters of pickpockets, and the isolated robbers, came and ranged
themselves around him in a horseshoe, of which gringoire, still roughly
held by the body, formed the centre. it was a semicircle of rags,
tatters, tinsel, pitchforks, axes, legs staggering with intoxication,
huge, bare arms, faces sordid, dull, and stupid. in the midst of this
round table of beggary, clopin trouillefou,--as the doge of this senate,
as the king of this peerage, as the pope of this conclave,--dominated;
first by virtue of the height of his hogshead, and next by virtue of
an indescribable, haughty, fierce, and formidable air, which caused his
eyes to flash, and corrected in his savage profile the bestial type of
the race of vagabonds. one would have pronounced him a boar amid a herd
of swine.

“listen,” said he to gringoire, fondling his misshapen chin with his
horny hand; “i don’t see w

pope’s guts.”

the word “mercy!” died away upon gringoire’s lips. he cast his eyes
about him; but there was no hope: all were laughing.

“bellevigne de l’etoile,” said the king of thunes to an enormous
vagabond, who stepped out from the ranks, “climb upon the cross beam.”

bellevigne de l’etoile nimbly mounted the transverse beam, and in
another minute, gringoire, on raising his eyes, beheld him, with terror,
seated upon the beam above his head.

“now,” resumed clopin trouillefou, “as soon as i clap my hands, you,
andry the red, will fling the stool to the ground with a blow of your
knee; you, françois chante-prune, will cling to the feet of the rascal;
and you, bellevigne, will fling yourself on his shoulders; and all three
at once, do you hear?”

gringoire shuddered.

“are you ready?” said clopin trouillefou to the three thieves, who held
themselves in readiness to fall upon gringoire. a moment of horrible
suspense ensued for the poor victim, during which clo

fantastically accoutred in many an oriental rag, was mathias hungadi

his legs crossed, and in a loud voice was bestowing his knowledge of
magic, both black and white, on many a gaping face which surrounded him.
another rabble pressed close around our old friend, the valiant king of
thunes, armed to the teeth. clopin trouillefou, with a very serious air
and in a low voice, was regulating the distribution of an enormous cask
of arms, which stood wide open in front of him and from whence poured
out in profusion, axes, swords, bassinets, coats of mail, broadswords,
lance-heads, arrows, and viretons,* like apples and grapes from a horn
of plenty. every one took something from the cask, one a morion, another
a long, straight sword, another a dagger with a cross--shaped hilt. the
very children were arming themselves, and the

the dripping-pan, where crackled a rain of grease, filled with its
continual sputtering the intervals of these thousand dialogues, which
intermingled from one end of the apartment to the other.

in the midst of this uproar, at the extremity of the tavern, on the
bench inside the chimney, sat a philosopher meditating with his feet in
the ashes and his eyes on the brands. it was pierre gringoire.

“be quick! make haste, arm yourselves! we set out on the march in an
hour!” said clopin trouillefou to his thieves.

a wench was humming,--

         “_bonsoir mon père et ma mere,
         les derniers couvrent le feu_.” *


     * good night, father and mother, the last cover up the fire.


two card players were disputing,--

“knave!” cried the reddest faced of the two, shaking his fist at the
other; “i’ll mark you with the club. you can take the place of mistigri
in the pack of cards of monseigneur the king.”

“ugh!” roared a norman, recognizable by his nasal accent; “

in the meantime, clopin trouillefou had finished the distribution of
arms. he approached gringoire, who appeared to be plunged in a profound
revery, with his feet on an andiron.

“friend pierre,” said the king of thunes, “what the devil are you
thinking about?”

gringoire turned to him with a melancholy smile.

ace, and thought
that he recognized all the heads who had saluted him as pope of the
fools some months previously. one man who held a torch in one hand and
a club in the other, mounted a stone post and seemed to be haranguing
them. at the same time the strange army executed several evolutions, as
though it were taking up its post around the church. quasimodo picked up
his lantern and descended to the platform between the towers, in order
to get a nearer view, and to spy out a means of defence.

clopin trouillefou, on arriving in front of the lofty portal of
notre-dame had, in fact, ranged his troops in order of battle. although
he expected no resistance, he wished, like a prudent general, to
preserve an order which would permit him to face, at need, a sudden
attack of the watch or the police. he had accordingly stationed his
brigade in such a manner that, viewed from above and from a distance,
one would have pronounced it the roman triangle of the battle of
ecnomus, the boar’s head of alexander or the

adolphus. the base of this triangle rested on the back of the place in
such a manner as to bar the entrance of the rue du parvis; one of its
sides faced hôtel-dieu, the other the rue saint-pierre-aux-boeufs.
clopin trouillefou had placed himself at the apex with the duke of
egypt, our friend jehan, and the most daring of the scavengers.

an enterprise like that which the vagabonds were now undertaking against
notre-dame was not a very rare thing in the cities of the middle ages.
what we now call the “police” did not exist then. in populous cities,
especially in capitals, there existed no single, central, regulating
power. feudalism had constructed these great communities in a singular
manner. a city was an assemb

discipline, that clopin’s orders were executed in
silence, and with admirable precision, the worthy chief of the band,
mounted on the parapet of the church square, and raised his hoarse and
surly voice, turning towards notre-dame, and brandishing his torch whose
light, tossed by the wind, and veiled every moment by its own smoke,
made the reddish façade of the church appear and disappear before the
eye.

“to you, louis de beaumont, bishop of paris, counsellor in the court of

ily closed, the internal
hurly-burly of the houses and of the hôtel-dieu, the wind in the flame,
the last death-rattle of the dying, and the continued crackling of the
rain of lead upon the pavement.

in the meanwhile, the principal vagabonds had retired beneath the porch
of the gondelaurier mansion, and were holding a council of war.

the duke of egypt, seated on a stone post, contemplated the
phantasmagorical bonfire, glowing at a height of two hundred feet in the
air, with religious terror. clopin trouillefou bit his huge fists with
rage.

“impossible to get in!” he muttered between his teeth.

“an old, enchanted church!” grumbled the aged bohemian, mathias hungadi
spicali.

“by the pope’s whiskers!” went on a sham soldier, who had once been in
service, “here are church gutters spitting melted lead at you better
than the machicolations of lectoure.”

“do you see that demon passing and repassing in front of the fire?”
 exclaimed the duke of egypt.
