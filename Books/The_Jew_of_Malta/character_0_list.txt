Barabas  - 
      The protagonist of the play. Barabas is a Jewish merchant who only cares for his daughter Abigail and his vast personal fortune. When Ferneze appropriates Barabas's estate to help the government pay Turkish tribute, Barabas is enraged and vows revenge. His clever plots lead to the deaths of many characters, including Abigail and the governor's son. The protagonist is marked as an outsider within Maltese society because of his religion and because of his Machiavellian cunning. However, in many ways Barabas is the least hypocritical character in the play. He is generally honest about what motivates his crimes, and he never attempts to justify his actions by religious doctrine. Nevertheless, as Barabas grows to delight in his own wickedness, we see how many of his murders are in fact motiveless acts driven by hate.
