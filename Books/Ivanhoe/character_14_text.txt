the singular appearance of this cavalcade not only attracted the
curiosity of wamba, but excited even that of his less volatile
companion. the monk he instantly knew to be the prior of jorvaulx
abbey, well known for many miles around as a lover of the chase, of
the banquet, and, if fame did him not wrong, of other worldly pleasures
still more inconsistent with his monastic vows.

yet so loose were the ideas of the times respecting the conduct of the
clergy, whether secular or regular, that the prior aymer maintained a
fair character in the neighbourhood of his abbey. his free and jovial
temper, and the readiness with which he granted absolution from all
ordinary delinquencies, rendered him a favourite among the nobility and
principal gentry, to several of whom he was allied by birth, being of
a distinguished norman family. the ladies, in particular, were not
disposed to scan too nicely the morals of a man who was a professed
admirer of their sex, and who possessed many means of dispelling the

en needful, he could sustain
with great decorum. his knowledge of books, however superficial, was
sufficient to impress upon their ignorance respect for his supposed
learning; and the gravity of his deportment and language, with the high
tone which he exerted in setting forth the authority of the church
and of the priesthood, impressed them no less with an opinion of his
sanctity. even the common people, the severest critics of the conduct of
their betters, had commiseration with the follies of prior aymer. he
was generous; and charity, as it is well known, covereth a multitude
of sins, in another sense than that in which it is said to do so in
scripture. the revenues of the monastery, of which a large part was at
his disposal, while they gave him the means of supplying his own very
considerable expenses, afforded also those largesses which he bestowed
among the peasantry, and with which he frequently relieved the
distresses of the oppressed. if prior aymer rode hard in the chase, or

g at the banquet,--if prior aymer was seen, at the early
peep of dawn, to enter the postern of the abbey, as he glided home
from some rendezvous which had occupied the hours of darkness, men
only shrugged up their shoulders, and reconciled themselves to his
irregularities, by recollecting that the same were practised by many
of his brethren who had no redeeming qualities whatsoever to atone for
them. prior aymer, therefore, and his character, were well known to
our saxon serfs, who made their rude obeisance, and received his
“benedicite, mes filz,” in return.

but the singular appearance of his companion and his attendants,
arrested their attention and excited their wonder, and they could
scarcely attend to the prior of jorvaulx’ question, when he demanded if
they knew of any place of harbourage in the vicinity; so much were they
surprised at the half monastic, half military appearance of the swa

“it is true,” replied wamba, “that i, being but an ass, am,
nevertheless, honoured to hear the bells as well as your reverence’s
mule; notwithstanding, i did conceive that the charity of mother church
and her servants might be said, with other charity, to begin at home.”

“a truce to thine insolence, fellow,” said the armed rider, breaking in
on his prattle with a high and stern voice, “and tell us, if thou canst,
the road to--how call’d you your franklin, prior aymer?”

“cedric,” answered the prior; “cedric the saxon.--tell me, good fellow,
are we near his dwelling, and can you show us the road?”

“the road will be uneasy to find,” answered gurth, who broke silence for
the first time, “and the family of cedric retire early to rest.”

“tush, tell not me, fellow,” said the military rider; “‘tis easy for
them to arise and supply the wants of travellers such as we are, who
will not stoop to beg the hospitality which we have a right to

, the shelter which most
are fain to ask as a favour.”

“do you dispute with me, slave!” said the soldier; and, setting spurs
to his horse, he caused him make a demivolte across the path, raising at
the same time the riding rod which he held in his hand, with a purpose
of chastising what he considered as the insolence of the peasant.

gurth darted at him a savage and revengeful scowl, and with a fierce,
yet hesitating motion, laid his hand on the haft of his knife; but the
interference of prior aymer, who pushed his mule betwixt his companion
and the swineherd, prevented the meditated violence.

“nay, by st mary, brother brian, you must not think you are now in
palestine, predominating over heathen turks and infidel saracens; we
islanders love not blows, save those of holy church, who chasteneth whom
she loveth.--tell me, good fellow,” said he to wamba, and seconded his
speech by a small piece of silver coin, “the way to cedric the saxon’s;

accustomed to deal with such spirits: our turkish captives are as fierce

them humble, submissive, serviceable, and observant of your will. marry,
sir, you must be aware of the poison and the dagger; for they use either
with free will when you give them the slightest opportunity.”

“ay, but,” answered prior aymer, “every land has its own manners and
fashions; and, besides that beating this fellow could procure us no
information respecting the road to cedric’s house, it would have been
sure to have established a quarrel betwixt you and him had we found our
way thither. remember what i told you: this wealthy franklin is proud,
fierce, jealous, and irritable, a withstander of the nobility, and even
of his neighbors, reginald front-de-boeuf and philip malvoisin, who are
no babies to strive with. he stan

his race, and is so proud of his uninterrupted descend from hereward, a
renowned champion of the heptarchy, that he is universally called cedric
the saxon; and makes a boast of his belonging to a people from whom
many others endeaver to hide their descent, lest they should encounter a
share of the ‘vae victis,’ or severities imposed upon the vanquished.”

“prior aymer,” said the templar, “you are a man of gallantry, learned
in the study of beauty, and as expert as a troubadour in all matters
concerning the ‘arrets’ of love; but i shall expect much beauty in this
celebrated rowena to counterbalance the self-denial and forbearance
which i must exert if i am to court the favor of such a seditious churl
as you have described her father cedric.”

“cedric is not her father,” replied the prior, “and is but of remote
relation: she is descended from h

returning in less than three minutes, a warder announced “that the prior
aymer of jorvaulx, and the good knight brian de bois-guilbert, commander
of the valiant and venerable order of knights templars, with a small
retinue, requested hospitality and lodging for the night, being on
their way to a tournament which was to be held not far from
ashby-de-la-zouche, on the second day from the present.”

“aymer, the prior aymer? brian de bois-guilbert?”--muttered cedric;
“normans both;--but norman or saxon, the hospitality of rotherwood must
not be impeached; they are welcome, since they have chosen to halt--more
welcome would they have been to have ridden further on their way--but it
were unworthy to murmur for a night’s lodging and a night’s food; in
the quality of guests, at least, even normans must suppress their
insolence.--go, hundebert,” he added, to a sort of major-domo who stood

the major-domo departed with several attendants, to execute his master’s
commands.

“the prior aymer!” repeated cedric, looking to oswald, “the brother, if
i mistake not, of giles de mauleverer, now lord of middleham?”

oswald made a respectful sign of assent. “his brother sits in the
seat, and usurps the patrimony, of a better race, the race of ulfgar of
middleham; but what norman lord doth not the same? this prior is, they
say, a free and jovial priest, who loves the wine-cup and the bugle-horn

a cope curiously embroidered. besides the massive golden signet ring,

the prior of jorvaulx crossed himself and repeated a pater noster, in
which all devoutly joined, excepting the jew, the mahomedans, and the
templar; the latter of whom, without vailing his bonnet, or testifying
any reverence for the alleged sanctity of the relic, took from his neck
a gold chain, which he flung on the board, saying--“let prior aymer
hold my pledge and that of this nameless vagrant, in token that when the
knight of ivanhoe comes within the four seas of britain, he underlies
the challenge of brian de bois-guilbert, which, if he answer not, i will
proclaim him as a coward on the walls of every temple court in europe.”

also made more conspicuous. the feather of an ostrich, fastened in her
turban by an agraffe set with brilliants, was another distinction of
the beautiful jewess, scoffed and sneered at by the proud dames who sat
above her, but secretly envied by those who affected to deride them.

“by the bald scalp of abraham,” said prince john, “yonder jewess must be
the very model of that perfection, whose charms drove frantic the wisest
king that ever lived! what sayest thou, prior aymer?--by the temple
of that wise king, which our wiser brother richard proved unable to
recover, she is the very bride of the canticles!”

“the rose of sharon and the lily of the valley,”--answered the prior, in
a sort of snuffling tone; “but your grace must remember she is still but
a jewess.”

“ay!” added prince john, without heeding him, “and there is my mammon
of unrighteousness too--the marquis of marks, the baron of byzants,
contesting for place with penniless dogs, whose thre

the audience were too much interested in the question not to pronounce
the prince’s assumed right altogether indubitable. “a generous
prince!--a most noble lord, who thus takes upon himself the task of
rewarding his faithful followers!”

such were the words which burst from the train, expectants all of
them of similar grants at the expense of king richard’s followers and
favourites, if indeed they had not as yet received such. prior aymer
also assented to the general proposition, observing, however, “that the
blessed jerusalem could not indeed be termed a foreign country. she
was ‘communis mater’--the mother of all christians. but he saw not,”
 he declared, “how the knight of ivanhoe could plead any advantage from
this, since he” (the prior) “was assured that the crusaders, under
richard, had never proceeded much farther than askalon, which, as all
the world knew, was a town of the philistines, and entitled to none

, whose sovereignty of a day this event has changed into
mourning. i am not a man to be moved by a woman’s lament for her lover,
but this same lady rowena suppressed her sorrow with such dignity of
manner, that it could only be discovered by her folded hands, and her
tearless eye, which trembled as it remained fixed on the lifeless form
before her.”

“who is this lady rowena,” said prince john, “of whom we have heard so
much?”

“a saxon heiress of large possessions,” replied the prior aymer; “a rose
of loveliness, and a jewel of wealth; the fairest among a thousand, a
bundle of myrrh, and a cluster of camphire.”

“we shall cheer her sorrows,” said prince john, “and amend her blood, by
wedding her to a norman. she seems a minor, and must therefore be at our
royal disposal in marriage.--how sayst thou, de bracy? what thinkst thou
of gaining fair lands and livings, by wedding a saxon, after the fashion
of the followers of the conqueror?”

“if the lands are to my liking,

banquets, and enough of norman courtesy.”

so saying, he arose and left the banqueting room, followed by
athelstane, and by several other guests, who, partaking of the saxon
lineage, held themselves insulted by the sarcasms of prince john and his
courtiers.

“by the bones of st thomas,” said prince john, as they retreated, “the
saxon churls have borne off the best of the day, and have retreated with
triumph!”

“‘conclamatum est, poculatum est’,” said prior aymer; “we have drunk and
we have shouted,--it were time we left our wine flagons.”

“the monk hath some fair penitent to shrive to-night, that he is in such
a hurry to depart,” said de bracy.

“not so, sir knight,” replied the abbot; “but i must move several miles
forward this evening upon my homeward journey.”

“they are breaking up,” said the prince in a whisper to fitzurse; “their
fears anticipate the event, and this coward prior is the first to shrink
from me.”

“fear n

nd i with the lances of my free companions.”

“a hopeful auxiliary,” said fitzurse impatiently; “playing the fool in
the very moment of utter necessity.--what on earth dost thou purpose by
this absurd disguise at a moment so urgent?”

“to get me a wife,” answered de bracy coolly, “after the manner of the
tribe of benjamin.”

“the tribe of benjamin?” said fitzurse; “i comprehend thee not.”

“wert thou not in presence yester-even,” said de bracy, “when we heard
the prior aymer tell us a tale in reply to the romance which was sung by
the minstrel?--he told how, long since in palestine, a deadly feud arose
between the tribe of benjamin and the rest of the israelitish nation;
and how they cut to pieces well-nigh all the chivalry of that tribe; and
how they swore by our blessed lady, that they would not permit those
who remained to marry in their lineage; and how they became grieved for
their vow, and sent to consult his holiness the pope how they might be

“away!” said the templar; “thou a leader of a free company, and regard
a woman’s tears! a few drops sprinkled on the torch of love, make the
flame blaze the brighter.”

“gramercy for the few drops of thy sprinkling,” replied de bracy; “but
this damsel hath wept enough to extinguish a beacon-light. never was
such wringing of hands and such overflowing of eyes, since the days of
st niobe, of whom prior aymer told us. [30] a water-fiend hath possessed
the fair saxon.”

“a legion of fiends have occupied the bosom of the jewess,” replied the
templar; “for, i think no single one, not even apollyon himself, could
have inspired such indomitable pride and resolution.--but where is
front-de-boeuf? that horn is sounded more and more clamorously.”

“he is negotiating with the jew, i suppose,” replied de bracy, coolly;
“probably the howls of isaac have drowned the blast of the bugle.

and wearing apparel.--here cometh the worthy prelate, as pert as a

the outlaw chief, our old friend, prior aymer of jorvaulx.

“i love a jolly woodsman at heart,” said the prior, softening his tone;
“come, ye must not deal too hard with me--i can well of woodcraft,
and can wind a horn clear and lustily, and hollo till every oak rings
again--come, ye must not deal too hard with me.”

“give him a horn,” said the outlaw; “we will prove the skill he boasts
of.”

the prior aymer winded a blast accordingly. the captain shook his head.

“sir prior,” he said, “thou blowest a merry note, but it may not ransom
thee--we cannot afford, as the legend on a good knight’s shield hath it,
to set thee free for a blast. moreover, i have found thee--thou art
one of those, who, with new french graces and tra-li-ras, disturb the
ancient english bugle notes.--prior, that last flourish on the recheat

“or, if so please you,” said isaac, willing to curry favour with the
outlaws, “i can send to york for the six hundred crowns, out of certain
monies in my hands, if so be that the most reverend prior present will
grant me a quittance.”

“he shall grant thee whatever thou dost list, isaac,” said the captain;
“and thou shalt lay down the redemption money for prior aymer as well as
for thyself.”

“for myself! ah, courageous sirs,” said the jew, “i am a broken and
impoverished man; a beggar’s staff must be my portion through life,
supposing i were to pay you fifty crowns.”

“the prior shall judge of that matter,” replied the captain.--“how say

“can he afford a ransom?” answered the prior “is he not isaac of york,

learning that his daughter lived, and might possibly be ransomed, threw
himself at the feet of the generous outlaw, and, rubbing his beard
against his buskins, sought to kiss the hem of his green cassock. the
captain drew himself back, and extricated himself from the jew’s grasp,
not without some marks of contempt.

“nay, beshrew thee, man, up with thee! i am english born, and love no
such eastern prostrations--kneel to god, and not to a poor sinner, like
me.”

“ay, jew,” said prior aymer; “kneel to god, as represented in the
servant of his altar, and who knows, with thy sincere repentance and due
gifts to the shrine of saint robert, what grace thou mayst acquire for
thyself and thy daughter rebecca? i grieve for the maiden, for she is of
fair and comely countenance,--i beheld her in the lists of ashby. also
brian de bois-guilbert is one with whom i may do much--bethink thee how
thou mayst deserve my good word with him.”

“alas! alas!” said the jew, “on every hand the

might have been done; but now thou must needs proceed by policy. come,

“in god’s name, diccon, an thou canst, aid me to recover the child of my
bosom!”

“do not thou interrupt me with thine ill-timed avarice,” said the
outlaw, “and i will deal with him in thy behalf.”

he then turned from the jew, who followed him, however, as closely as
his shadow.

“prior aymer,” said the captain, “come apart with me under this tree.
men say thou dost love wine, and a lady’s smile, better than beseems thy
order, sir priest; but with that i have nought to do. i have heard, too,
thou dost love a brace of good dogs and a fleet horse, and it may well
be that, loving things which are costly to come by, thou hatest not a
purse of gold. but i have never heard that thou didst love oppression or
cruelty.--now, here is isaac willing to give thee the means of pleasure

intercession with thine ally the templar shall avail to procure the

“in safety and honour, as when taken from me,” said the jew, “otherwise
it is no bargain.”

“peace, isaac,” said the outlaw, “or i give up thine interest.--what say
you to this my purpose, prior aymer?”

“the matter,” quoth the prior, “is of a mixed condition; for, if i do a
good deal on the one hand, yet, on the other, it goeth to the vantage
of a jew, and in so much is against my conscience. yet, if the israelite
will advantage the church by giving me somewhat over to the building
of our dortour, [45] i will take it on my conscience to aid him in the
matter of his daughter.”

with a much worse grace than that wherewith he had penned the letter to
bois-guilbert, the prior wrote an acquittance, discharging isaac of york
of six hundred crowns, advanced to him in his need for acquittal of his
ransom, and faithfully promising to hold true compt with him for that
sum.

“and now,” said prior aymer, “i will pray you of restitution of my mules
and palfreys, and the freedom of the reverend brethren attending upon
me, and also of the gymmal rings, jewels, and fair vestures, of which
i have been despoiled, having now satisfied you for my ransom as a true

 scandalizing the order; yet, unless he told it, what
hope could he have of achieving his daughter’s deliverance? beaumanoir
saw his mortal apprehension, and condescended to give him some
assurance.

“fear nothing,” he said, “for thy wretched person, jew, so thou dealest
uprightly in this matter. i demand again to know from thee thy business
with brian de bois-guilbert?”

“i am bearer of a letter,” stammered out the jew, “so please your

jorvaulx.”

“said i not these were evil times, conrade?” said the master. “a
cistertian prior sends a letter to a soldier of the temple, and can find
no more fitting messenger than an unbelieving jew.--give me the letter.”

the jew, with trembling hands, undid the folds of his armenian cap, in
which he had deposited the prior’s tablets for the greater security, and
was about to approach, with hand extended and body crouched, to place it
within the reach of his grim i
