[prologue]

                enter the ghost of andrea, and with him revenge.

  ghost.  when this eternal substance of my soul
    did live imprison'd in my wanton flesh,
    each in their function s

y then, to gain the glory of the field,
    my twining arms shall yoke and make thee yield.

  hor.  nay then, my arms are large and strong withal:
    thus elms by vines are compass'd till they fall.

  bel.  o, let me go, for in my troubled eyes
    now may'st thou read that life in passion dies!

  hor.  o, stay a-while, and i will die with thee;
    so shalt thou yield, and yet have conquer'd me.

  bel.  who's there?  pedringano?  we are betray'd!

                enter lorenzo, balthazar, serberine,
                pedringano, disguised.

  lor.  my lord, away with her!  take her aside!
    o sir, forbear, your valour is already tried.
    quickly dispatch, my masters.

                they hang him in the arbor.

  hor.                          what, will you murder me?

  lor.  aye; thus!  and thus!  these are the fruits of love!

                they stab him.

  bel.  o, save his life, and let me die for him!
    o, save him, brother!  save him, balthazar!
    i lov'd horatio, but he

is?  hieronimo?

  hiero.                my lord.

  ped.  he asketh for my lady bel-imperia.

  lor.  what to do, hieronimo?  use me.

  hiero.  oh, no, my lord, i dare not, it must not be;
    i humbly thank your lordship.

  lor.                          why then, farewell!

  hiero.  my grief no heart, my thoughts no tongue can tell.

                exit.

  lor.  come hither, pedringano; see'st thou this?

  ped.  my lord, i see it, and suspect it too.

  lor.  this is that damned villain serberine,
    that hath, i fear, reveal'd horatio's death.

  ped.  my lord, he could not; 'twas so lately done,
    and since he hath not left my company.

  lor.  admit he have not; his conditions such
    as fear or flattering words may make him false.
    i know his humour, and therewith repent
    that e'er i us'd him in this enterprise.
    but, pedringano, to prevent the worst,
    and 'cause i know thee secret as my soul,
    here, for thy further satisfaction, take thou this!

ives him more gold.

    and hearken to me;  thus it is devis'd:
    this night thou must--and prithee so resolve--
    meet serberine at st. luigi's park,--
    thou knowest 'tis here hard by behind the house;
    there take thy stand, and see thou strike him sure,
    for die he must, if we do mean to live.

  ped.  but how shall serberine be there, my lord?

  lor.  let me alone, i'll send him to meet
    the prince and me where thou must do this deed.

  ped.  it shall be done, my lord; it shall be done;
    and i'll go arm myself to meet him there.

  lor.  when things shall alter, as i hope they will,
    then shalt thou mount for this, thou knowest my mind.

                exit pedringano.

    che le ieron!

                enter page.

    to serberine, and bid

    the prince and me at s. luigi's park,
    behind the house, this evening, boy.

  page.                         i go, my lord.

  lor.  but, sirrah, let the hour be eight o'clock.
    bid him not fail.

  page.         i fly, my lord.

                exit.

  lor.  now to confirm the complot thou hast cast
    of all these practices, i'll spread the watch,
    upon precise commandment from the king
    strongly to guard the place where pedringano
    this night shall murder hapless serberine.
    thus must we work that will avoid distrust,
    thus must we practice to prevent mishap,
    and thus one ill another must expulse.
    this sly enquiry of hieronimo
    for bel-imperia breeds suspicion;
    and this suspicion bodes a further ill.
    as for myself, i know my secret fault,
    and so do they, but i have dealt for them.
    they that for coin their souls endangered
    to save my life, for coin shall venture theirs;
    and better 'tis that base companions die
    than by t

harms.
    besides, this place is free from all suspect.
    here therefore will i stay and take my stand.

                enter the watch.

  i watch.  i wonder much to what intent it is
    that we are thus expressly charg'd to watch.

  ii watch.  this by commandment in the king's own
    name.

  iii watch.  but we were never wont to watch and ward
    so near the duke his brother's house before.

  ii watch.  content yourself, stand close, there's somewhat
    in't.

                enter serberine.

  ser. [aside]  here, serberine, attend and stay thy pace;
    for here did don lorenzo's page appoint
    that thou by his command shouldst meet with him.
    how fit a place, if one were so dispos'd,
    methinks this corner is to close with one.

  ped. [aside]  here comes the bird that i must seize upon;
    now, pedringano, or never play the man!

  ser.  [aside]  i wonder that his lordship stays so long,
    or wherefore should he send for me so late.

  ped.  for this, serberine; and t

 by those base confed'rates in our fault
    touching the death of don horatio
    we are all betray'd to old hieronimo.

  bal.  betray'd, lorenzo? tush!  it cannot be.

  lor.  a guilty conscience urged with the thought
    of former evils, easily cannot err:
    i am persuaded--and dissuade me not--
    that all's revealed to hieronimo.
    and therefore know that i have cast it thus--

                [enter page.]

    but here's the page.  how now?  what news with thee?

  page.  my lord, serberine is slain.

  bal.  who?  serberine, my man?

  page. your highness' man, my lord.

  lor.  speak, page: who murder'd him?

  page.  he that is apprehended for the fact.

  lor.  who?

  page.         pedringano.

  bal.  is serberine slain, that lov'd his lord so well?
    injurious villain!  murd'rer of his friend!

  lor.  hath pedringano murder'd serberine?
    my lord, let me entreat you to take the pains
    to exasperate and hasten his revenge
    with your complaints unto my lord the kin

nearer matter that concerneth him,
    for fear his lordship had forgotten me;
    but, sith he hath remember'd me so well,
    come, come, come on!  when shall we to this gear?

  hiero.  stand forth, thou monster, murderer of men,
    and here, for satisfaction of the world,
    confess thy folly and repent thy fault,
    for there's thy place of execution.

  ped.  this is short work!  well, to your martiallship
    first i confess, nor fear i death therefore,
    i am the man,--'twas i slew serberine.
    but, sir, then you think this shall be the place
    where we shall satisfy you for this gear?

  depu.  aye, pedrigano.

  ped.                  no i think not so.

  heiro.  peace, impudent!  for thou shalt find it so;
    for blood with blood shall, while i sit as judge,
    be satisfied, and the law discharg'd.
    and, though myself cannot receive the like,
    yet will i see that others have their right.
    dispatch!  the fault approved and confess'd,
    and by our law he is condem

ol of acheron,
    to weep my want for my sweet balthazar.
    spain hath no refuge for a portingale!

                the trumpets sound a dead march, the king of spain
                mourning after his brother's body, and the king of
                portingal bearing the body of his son.


[chorus.]

                enter ghost and revenge.

  ghost.  aye; now my hopes have end in their effects,
    when blood and sorrow finish my desires:
    horatio murder'd in his father's bower,
    vile serberine by pedrigano slain,
    false pedrigano hang'd by quaint device,
    fair isabella by herself misdone,
    prince balthazar by bel-imperia stabb'd,
    the duke of castile and his wicked son
    both done to death by old hieronimo,
    my bel-imperia fallen as dido fell,
    and good hieronimo slain by himself!
    aye, these were spectacles to please my soul.
    now will i beg at lovely proserpine
    that, by the virtue of her princely doom,
    i may consort my friends in pleasing sort,

ne but furies, bugs and tortures dwell.

  ghost.  then, sweet revenge, do this at my request:
    let me judge and doom them to unrest;
    let loose poor titius from the vulture's gripe,
    and let don ciprian supply his room;
    place don lorenzo on ixion's wheel,
    and let the lovers' endless pains surcease,
    juno forget old wrath and grant him ease;
    hang balthazar about chimera's neck,
    and let him there bewail his bloody love,
    repining at our joys that are above;
    let serberine go roll the fatal stone
    and take from sisyphus his endless moan;
    false pedringano, for his treachery,
    let him be dragg'd through boiling acheron,
    and there live dying still in endless flames,
    blaspheming gods and all their holy names.

  revenge.  then haste we down to meet thy friends and foes;
    to place thy friends in ease, the rest in woes.
    for here though death doth end their misery,
    i'll there begin their endless tragedy.

                exeunt.
