tom for the speech at a veselija to be taken out
of one of the books and learned by heart; but in his youthful days dede
antanas used to be a scholar, and really make up all the love letters
of his friends. now it is understood that he has composed an original
speech of congratulation and benediction, and this is one of the events
of the day. even the boys, who are romping about the room, draw near and
listen, and some of the women sob and wipe their aprons in their eyes.
it is very solemn, for antanas rudkus has become possessed of the idea
that he has not much longer to stay with his children. his speech leaves
them all so tearful that one of the guests, jokubas szedvilas, who keeps
a delicatessen store on halsted street, and is fat and hearty, is moved
to rise and say that things may not be as bad as that, and then to go on
and make a little speech of his own, in which he showers congratulations
and prophecies of happiness upon the bride and groom, proceeding to
particulars which greatly delight

en a fair-sized town, until
he had set out to make his fortune in the world and earn his right
to ona. his father, and his father’s father before him, and as many
ancestors back as legend could go, had lived in that part of lithuania
known as brelovicz, the imperial forest. this is a great tract of a
hundred thousand acres, which from time immemorial has been a hunting
preserve of the nobility. there are a very few peasants settled in it,
holding title from ancient times; and one of these was antanas rudkus,
who had been reared himself, and had reared his children in turn, upon
half a dozen acres of cleared land in the midst of a wilderness. there
had been one son besides jurgis, and one sister. the former had been
drafted into the army; that had been over ten years ago, but since that
day nothing had ever been heard of him. the sister was married, and her
husband had bought the place when old antanas had decided to go with his
son.

it was nearly a year and a half ago that jurgis had met ona, at

en he was twelve, because
his father beat him for trying to learn to read. and he was a faithful
man, too; he was a man you might leave alone for a month, if only you
had made him understand what you wanted him to do in the meantime. and
now here he was, worn out in soul and body, and with no more place in
the world than a sick dog. he had his home, as it happened, and some one
who would care for him if he never got a job; but his son could not help
thinking, suppose this had not been the case. antanas rudkus had been
into every building in packingtown by this time, and into nearly every
room; he had stood mornings among the crowd of applicants till the very
policemen had come to know his face and to tell him to go home and give
it up. he had been likewise to all the stores and saloons for a mile
about, begging for some little thing to do; and everywhere they had
ordered him out, sometimes with curses, and not once even stopping to
ask him a question.

so, after all, there was a crack in the fine st

en to him, and promised to bring him a
third of all he earned; and that same day he was put to work in durham’s
cellars. it was a “pickle room,” where there was never a dry spot to
stand upon, and so he had to take nearly the whole of his first week’s
earnings to buy him a pair of heavy-soled boots. he was a “squeedgie”
 man; his job was to go about all day with a long-handled mop, swabbing
up the floor. except that it was damp and dark, it was not an unpleasant
job, in summer.

now antanas rudkus was the meekest man that god ever put on earth; and
so jurgis found it a striking confirmation of what the men all said,
that his father had been at work only two days before he came home as
bitter as any of them, and cursing durham’s with all the power of his
soul. for they had set him to cleaning out the traps; and the family
sat round and listened in wonder while he told them what that meant. it
seemed that he was working in the room where the men prepared the beef
for canning, and the bee

iff and cold. things were not going well with them then,
and though it nearly broke teta elzbieta’s heart, they were forced to
dispense with nearly all the decencies of a funeral; they had only a
hearse, and one hack for the women and children; and jurgis, who was
learning things fast, spent all sunday making a bargain for these, and
he made it in the presence of witnesses, so that when the man tried to
charge him for all sorts of incidentals, he did not have to pay. for
twenty-five years old antanas rudkus and his son had dwelt in the forest
together, and it was hard to part in this way; perhaps it was just as
well that jurgis had to give all his attention to the task of having
a funeral without being bankrupted, and so had no time to indulge in
memories and grief.


now the dreadful winter was come upon them. in the forests, all summer
long, the branches of the trees do battle for light, and some of them
lose and die; and then come the raging blasts, and the storms of snow
and hail, and strew th
