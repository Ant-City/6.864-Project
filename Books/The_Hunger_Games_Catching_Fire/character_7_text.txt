glued to their chariots, the 
scene  is  very  social.  the  victors,  both  this  year's  tributes  and  their  mentors,  are  standing 
around  in  small  groups,  talking.  of  course,  they  all  know  one  another  and  i  don't  know 
anyone, and i'm not really the sort of person to go around introducing myself. so i just stroke 
the neck of one of my horses and try not to be noticed. it doesn't work. 

the crunching hits my ear before i even know he's beside me, and when i turn my head, 
finnick odair's  famous sea green eyes  are only  inches  from  mine. he pops a sugar cube  in 
his mouth and leans against my horse. 

â€œhello, katniss,â€ he says, as if we've known each other for years, when in fact we've never 

met. 

â€œhello,  finnick,â€  i  say,  just  as  casually,  although  i'm  feeling  uncomfortable  at  his 

closeness, especially since he's got so much bare skin exposed. 

â€œwant a sugar cube?â€ he says, offering his hand, which is piled high. â€œthey're supposed to 
be fo

book,â€ i whisper back. â€œeverybody seems to know my secrets before i know them myself.â€ 

he  smiles.  â€œunfortunately,  i  think  that's  true.â€  his  eyes  flicker  off  to the  side.  â€œpeeta  is 
coming.  sorry  you  have  to  cancel  your  wedding.  i  know  how  devastating  that  must  be  for 
you.â€ he tosses another sugar cube in his mouth and saunters off. 

peeta's beside me, dressed in an outfit identical to mine. â€œwhat did finnick odair want?â€ 

he asks. 

i turn and put  my  lips close to peeta's and drop my  eyelids  in  imitation of finnick.  â€œhe 

offered me sugar and wanted to know all my secrets,â€ i say in my best seductive voice. 

peeta laughs. â€œugh. not really.â€ 

â€œreally,â€ i say. â€œi'll tell you more when my skin stops crawling.â€ 

â€œdo you think we'd have ended up like this if only one of us had won?â€ he asks, glancing 

around at the other victors. â€œjust another part of the freak show?â€

bringing peeta back from the dead. 

â€œno. it's notâ€”â€ i get out, but i'm cut off by an even more hysterical round of sobbing that 
seems only to confirm what finnick said about the baby. he meets my eyes and i glare at him 
through my tears. it's stupid, i know, that his efforts make me so vexed. all i wanted was to 
keep peeta alive, and i couldn't and finnick could, and i should be nothing but grateful. and i 
am. but i am also furious because it means that i will never stop owing finnick odair. ever. 
so how can i kill him in his sleep? 

i  expect  to  see  a  smug  or  sarcastic  expression  on  his  face,  but  his  look  is  strangely 
quizzical. he glances between peeta and me, as if trying to figure something out, then gives 
his head a slight shake as if to clear it. â€œhow are you?â€ he asks peeta. â€œdo you think you can 
move on?â€ 

â€œno, he has to rest,â€ i say. my nose is running like crazy and i don't even have a shred of 
fabric to use as a handkerchief. mags rips

ither side of peeta, lean over until our faces are inches from his nose, and give him a shake. 
â€œpeeta. peeta, wake up,â€ i say in a soft, singsong voice. 

his eyelids flutter open and then he jumps like we've stabbed him. â€œaa!â€ 

finnick and i fall back in the sand, laughing our heads off. every time we try to stop, we 
look  at  peeta's  attempt  to  maintain  a  disdainful  expression  and  it  sets  us  off  again.  by  the 
time we pull ourselves together, i'm thinking that  maybe  finnick odair  is all right. at least 
not as vain or self-important as i'd thought. not so bad at all, really. and just as i've come to 
this conclusion, a parachute  lands  next to  us with a  fresh  loaf of  bread. remembering  from 
last year how haymitch's gifts are often timed to send a message, i make a note to myself. be 
friends with finnick. you'll get food. 

finnick turns the bread over in his hands, examining the crust. a bit too possessively. it's 
not necessary. it's got that green tint from s

ry for what 
seems like always. they reinsert their tubes and talk to me in soothing voices that never reach 
me.  all i can think of  is peeta, lying on a similar table somewhere, while they try to break 
him for information he doesn't even have. 

â€œkatniss. katniss, i'm sorry.â€ finnick's voice comes from the bed next to me and slips into 
my consciousness. perhaps because we're in the same kind of pain. â€œi wanted to go back for 
him and johanna, but i couldn't move.â€ 

i don't answer. finnick odair's good intentions mean less than nothing. 

â€œit's better for him than johanna. they'll  figure out he doesn't know anything pretty fast. 

and they won't kill him if they think they can use him against you,â€ says finnick. 

â€œlike bait?â€ i say to the ceiling. â€œlike how they'll use annie for bait, finnick?â€ 

i can hear him weeping but i don't care. they probably won't even bother to question her, 
she's so far gone. gone right off the deep end years ago in her games. there's a good
