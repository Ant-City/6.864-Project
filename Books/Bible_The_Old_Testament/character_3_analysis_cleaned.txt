[CHARACTER] 

[CHARACTER] is a strong but unassuming shepherd who becomes
god's choice to replace saul as king of israel. he is humble yet
self-possessed, readily dismissing human opinion. his humility becomes clear
early in his youth, when he kills the giant goliath with a sling stone,
declining the opportunity to use saul's royal armor. as king, his
foremost quality is obedience to god. for example, when his wife
expresses embarrassment at [CHARACTER]'s dancing while he marches into
jerusalem, he rebukes her, boasting that he will embarrass himself
so long as it pleases god.
[CHARACTER]'s mercy to others displays his selflessness--a
product of his strenuous commitment to ethical ideals. his sense
of propriety is striking when he refrains from killing saul while
saul has his back turned. [CHARACTER] scorns the easy opportunity to attack
because he feels it would be morally wrong to strike god's current
anointed ruler. as king, [CHARACTER] forgives the kingdom's traitors,
and executes the traitors of his enemies. when his own rebellious
son dies, [CHARACTER] cries aloud in public, "o my son absalom, my son,
my son absalom!" (2 samuel 18:33).
his weeping suggests the depth of a father's blind love for his
son.
[CHARACTER]'s mercy may also be interpreted as a product of
his political aspirations. [CHARACTER] refuses to kill saul because he
senses that whatever standards he imposes against the current king
may one day be used against himself as ruler. moreover, seeds of
revolt have already been planted in the northern tribes of israel
by [CHARACTER]'s reign, and the kingdom's unity may be on shaky ground.
king [CHARACTER] shows mercy to his traitors, especially absalom, because
he wishes to quell emotions and court the graces of all his subjects.
by this reading, [CHARACTER] appears to be a pragmatist--one who acts not
out of his or her ideals, but on the basis of what is practical
or expedient. however, the old testament ultimately seems to suggest
that [CHARACTER]'s religious ideals do not conflict with his pragmatism.
