rate courtesy, of high-
paced gallantry, of courageous venture, of noble disdain for
mean tranquillity; and chaucer, on the whole a man of peaceful
avocations, was penetrated to the depth of his consciousness
with the lofty and lovely civil side of that brilliant and restless
military period. no record of his youthful years, however,
remains to us; if we believe that at the age of eighteen he was a
student of cambridge, it is only on the strength of a reference in
his "court of love", where the narrator is made to say that his
name is philogenet, "of cambridge clerk;" while he had  already
told us that when he was stirred to seek the court of cupid he
was "at eighteen year of age." according to leland, however,
he was educated at oxford, proceeding thence to france and
the netherlands, to finish his studies; but there remains no

lips.  and the belief is not impaired by the sorrowful way in
which the clerk lingers on petrarch's death -- which would be
less intelligible if the fictitious narrator had only read the story
in the latin translation, than if we suppose the news of
petrarch's death at arqua in july 1374 to have closely followed
chaucer to england, and to have cruelly and irresistibly mingled
itself with our poet's personal recollections of his great italian
contemporary.  nor must we regard as without significance the
manner in which the clerk is made to distinguish between the
"body" of petrarch's tale, and the fashion in which it was set
forth in writing, with a proem that
