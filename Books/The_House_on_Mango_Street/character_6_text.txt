the 
house 
on 
mango 
street 

we  didn't always  live  on  mango street.  before  that 
we lived on loomis on the third floor, and before that we 
lived on keeler.  before keeler it was  paulina, and before 
that i can't remember. but what i remember most is mov­
ing a lot.  each  time it seemed there'd be one more of us. 
by  the time we  got to mango street we  were six-mama, 
papa, carlos,  kiki,  my  sister nenny and me. 

the house on mango street is ours, and we don't have 
to pay rent to anybody, or share the yard with the people 
downstairs, or be careful not to make too much noise, and 
there isn't a landlord banging on the ceiling with a broom. 
but even so,  it's not the house we'd  thought we'd  get.

there.  i nodded.
 

i knew then i had to have a house. a real house. one
 
i  could  point  to.  but  this  isn't  it.  the  house  on  mango
 
street isn't it.  for the time being,  mama says. temporary,
 
says  papa.  but i know  how  those things go.

screet. far away,  on the other side of town. 

they always told us

 each  year.  and  our house  would 
have running water and pipes that worked.  and inside it 
would have real stairs,  not hallway stairs,  but stairs inside 
like the houses on t.v. and we'd have a basement and at 
1casl three washrooms so when we took a bath we wouldn't 
have to tell everybody. our house would be white with trees 
around it,  a  great  big  yard  and  grass  growing  without a 
fence. this was the house papa talked about when he held 
a lottery ticket and this was  the house mama dreamed up 
in  the stories she told us before we  went to  bed. 

but the  house on  mango street is  not the  way  they 
told it at all.  it's small and red with tight steps in front and 
windows  so  small  you'd  think  they  were  holding  their 
breath. bricks are crumbling in places, and the front door 
is so swollen you have to push hard to get in. there is  no 
front yard, only four little elms the city planted by the curb. 
out  back  is  a  small  garage  for  the  car we  don't  own

and a small yard that looks smaller between the two build­
ings  on  either  side.  there  are  stairs  in  our  house,  but 
they're ordinary hallway stairs, and the house has only one 
washroom. everybody has to share a bedroom-mama and 
papa, carlos and kiki,  me and nenny. 

once when we were living on loomis, a nun from my 
school passed by and saw  me playing out front.  the laun­

what sally said 

he never hits me hard. she said  her mama rubs lard
 
on all  the  places where it  hurts. then at  school  she'd  say
 
she fell. that's where all  the blue places come from. that's
 
why  her skin  is  always  scarred.
 

but who believes her. a girl that big, a girl who comes
 
in  with  her pretty face all  beaten and black can't be falling
 
off the stairs.  he never hits  me hard.
 

but sally doesn't tell  about that time he  hit  her with
 
his  hands just like a dog, she said, like if i was  an animal. 
he thinks i'm going to
