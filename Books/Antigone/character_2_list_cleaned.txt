[CHARACTER] - 
      blonde, full-figured, and radiantly beautiful, the laughing, talkative [CHARACTER] is the good girl of the family. she is reasonable and understands her place, bowing to creon's edict and attempting to dissuade antigone from her act of rebellion. as in sophocles' play, she is antigone's foil. ultimately she will recant and beg antigone to allow her to join her in death. though antigone refuses, [CHARACTER]'s conversion indicates how her resistance is contagious.
