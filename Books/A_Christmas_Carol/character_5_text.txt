state upon this couch, there sat a jolly giant, glorious to
see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike plenty's
horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on scrooge,
as he came peeping round the door.

"come in!" exclaimed the ghost. "come in! and know
me better, man!"

scrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this
spirit. he was not the dogged scrooge he had been; and
though the spirit's eyes were clear and kind, he did not like
to meet them.

"i am the ghost of christmas present," said the spirit.
"look upon me!"

scrooge reverently did so. it was clothed in one simple
green robe, or mantle, bordered with white fur. this garment
hung so loosely on the figure, that its capacious breast was
bare, as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any
artifice. its feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the
garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no other
covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining
icicles. its dark brown curls were lo

"you have never seen the like of me before!" exclaimed
the spirit.

"never," scrooge made answer to it.

"have never walked forth with the younger members of
my family; meaning (for i am very young) my elder brothers
born in these later years?" pursued the phantom.

"i don't think i have," said scrooge. "i am afraid i have
not. have you had many brothers, spirit?"

"more than eighteen hundred," said the ghost.

"a tremendous family to provide for!" muttered scrooge.

the ghost of christmas present rose.

"spirit," said scrooge submissively, "conduct me where
you will. i went forth last night on compulsion, and i learnt
a lesson which is working now. to-night, if you have aught
to teach me, let me profit by it."

"touch my robe!"

scrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.

holly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game,
poultry, brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings,
fruit, and punch, all vanished instantly. so did the room,
the fire, the ruddy g

 off this power of his, or else it was his own kind,
generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor
men, that led him straight to scrooge's clerk's; for there he
went, and took scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and
on the threshold of the door the spirit smiled, and stopped
to bless bob cratchit's dwelling with the sprinkling of his
torch. think of that! bob had but fifteen "bob" a-week
himself; he pocketed on saturdays but fifteen copies of his
christian name; and yet the ghost of christmas present
blessed his four-roomed house!

then up rose mrs. cratchit, cratchit's wife, dressed out
but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons,
which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and
she laid the cloth, assisted by belinda cratchit, second of
her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while master peter
cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and
getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (bob's private
property, conferred upon his son and heir in

but they didn't devote the whole evening to music. after
a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children
sometimes, and never better than at christmas, when its
mighty founder was a child himself. stop! there was first
a game at blind-man's buff. of course there was. and i
no more believe topper was really blind than i believe he
had eyes in his boots. my opinion is, that it was a done
thing between him and scrooge's nephew; and that the
ghost of christmas present knew it. the way he went after
that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the
credulity of human nature. knocking down the fire-irons,
tumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano,
smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went,
there went he! he always knew where the plump sister was.
he wouldn't catch anybody else. if you had fallen up
against him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would
have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would

shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to
shake very much; and shaving requires attention, even when
you don't dance while you are at it. but if he had cut the
end of his nose off, he would have put a piece of
sticking-plaister over it, and been quite satisfied.

he dressed himself "all in his best," and at last got out
into the streets. the people were by this time pouring forth,
as he had seen them with the ghost of christmas present;
and walking with his hands behind him, scrooge regarded
every one with a delighted smile. he looked so irresistibly
pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured fellows
said, "good morning, sir! a merry christmas to you!"
and scrooge said often afterwards, that of all the blithe
sounds he had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears.

he had not gone far, when coming on towards him he
beheld the portly gentleman, who had walked into his
counting-house the day before,
