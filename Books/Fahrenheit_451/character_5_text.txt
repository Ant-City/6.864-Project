e some coffee?" 

he watched the dark steaming mixture pour into a collapsible tin cup, which was handed him 

straight off. he sipped it gingerly and felt them looking at him with curiosity. his lips were 

scalded, but that was good. the faces around him were bearded, but the beards were clean, neat, 

and their hands were clean. they had stood up as if to welcome a guest, and now they sat down 

again. montag sipped. "thanks," he said. "thanks very much." 

"you're welcome, montag. my name's granger." he held out a small bottle of colourless fluid. 

"drink this, too. it'll change the chemical index of your perspiration. half an hour from now 

you'll smell like two other people. with the hound after you, the best thing is bottoms up." 

montag drank the bitter fluid. 

"you'll stink like a bobcat, but that's all right," said granger. 



"you know my name;" said montag. 

granger nodded to a portable battery tv set by the fire. 

"we've watched the chase. figured you'd wind up south along

plunging around out in the forest like a drunken elk, we didn't hide as we usually do. we figured 

you were in the river, when the helicopter cameras swung back in over the city. something funny 

there. the chase is still running. the other way, though." 

"the other way?" 

"let's have a look." 

granger snapped the portable viewer on. the picture was a nightmare, condensed, easily passed 

from hand to hand, in the forest, all whirring colour and flight. a voice cried: 

"the chase continues north in the city! police helicopters are converging on avenue 87 and elm 

grove park!" 

granger nodded. "they're faking. you threw them off at the river. they can't admit it. they 

know they can hold their audience only so long. the show's got to have a snap ending, quick! if 

they started searching t

"but how--" 

"watch." 

the camera, hovering in the belly of a helicopter, now swung down at an empty street. 

"see that?" whispered granger. "it'll be you; right up at the end of that street is our victim. see 

how our camera is coming in? building the scene. suspense. long shot. right now, some poor 

fellow is out for a walk. a rarity. an odd one. don't think the police don't know the habits of 

queer ducks like that, men who walk mornings for the hell of it, or for reasons of insomnia 

anyway, the police have had him charted for months, years. never know when that sort of 

information might be handy. and today, it turns out,

and then, after a time of the men sitting around the fire, their faces expressionless, an announcer 

on the dark screen said, "the search is over, montag is dead; a crime against society has been

darkness. 

"we now take you to the sky room of the hotel lux for a half-hour of just-before-dawn, a 

programme of-" 

granger turned it off. 

"they didn't show the man's face in focus. did you notice? 

even your best friends couldn't tell if it was you. they scrambled it just enough to let the 

imagination take over. hell," he whispered. "hell." 

montag said nothing but now, looking back, sat with his eyes fixed to the blank screen, 

trembling. 

granger touched montag's arm. "welcome back from the dead." montag nodded. granger went 

on. "you might as well know all of us, now. this is fred clement, former occupa

were separate individuals, all we had was rage. i struck a fireman when he came to burn my 

library years ago. i've been running ever since. you want to join us, montag?" 

"yes." 

"what have you to offer?" 

"nothing. i thought i had part of the book of ecclesiastes and maybe a little of revelation, but i 

haven't even that now." 

"the book of ecclesiastes would be fine. where was it?" 

"here," montag touched his head. 

"ah," granger smiled and nodded. 

"what's wrong? isn't that all right?" said montag. 

"better than all right; perfect!" granger turned to the reverend. "do we have a book of 

ecclesiastes?" 

"one. a man named harris of youngstown." 

"montag." granger took montag's shoulder firmly. "walk carefully. guard your health. if 

anything should happen to harris, you are the book of ecclesiastes. see how important you've 

become in the last minute!" 

"but i've forgotten!" 

"no, nothing's ever lost. we have wa

everyone laughed quietly. 

"it can't be," said montag. 

"it is," replied granger, smiling. " we're book-burners, too. we read the books and burnt them, 

afraid they'd be found. micro-filming didn't pay off; we were always travelling, we didn't want to 

bury the film and come back later. always the chance of discovery. better to keep it in the old 

heads, where no one can see it or suspect it. we are all bits and pieces of history and literature

year, the books can be written again, the people will be called in, one by one, to recite what they 

know and we'll set it up in type until another dark age, when we might have to do the whole 

damn thing over again. but that's the wonderful thing about man; he never gets so discouraged or 

disgusted that he gives up doing it all over again, because he knows very well it is important and 

worth the doing." 

"what do we do tonight?" asked montag. 

"wait," said granger. "and move downstream a little way, just in case." 

he began throwing dust and dirt on the fire. 

the other men helped, and montag helped, and there, in the wilderness, the men all moved their 

hands, putting out the fire together. 

they stood by the river in the starlight. 

montag saw the luminous dial of his waterproof. five. five o'clock in the morning. another year 

ticked by in a single hour, and dawn waiting beyond the far bank of the river. 

"why do you trust me?" said montag.

later years, some with clean and some with dirty fingers. 

montag squinted from one face to another as they walked. 

"don't judge a book by its cover," someone said. 

and they all laughed quietly, moving downstream. 

there was a shriek and the jets from the city were gone overhead long before the men looked up. 

montag stared back at the city, far down the river, only a faint glow now. 

"my wife's back there." 

"i'm sorry to hear that. the cities won't do well in the next few days," said granger. 

"it's strange, i don't miss her, it's strange i don't feel much of anything," said montag. "even if 

she dies, i realized a moment ago, i don't think i'll feel sad. it isn't right. something must be 

wrong with me." 



"listen," said granger, taking his arm, and walking with him, holding aside the bushes to let him 
pass. "when i was a boy my grandfather died, and he was a sculptor. he was also a very kind 
man who had a lot of love to give the world, and he helped clean up the slum in ou

montag walked in silence. "millie, millie," he whispered. "millie." 
"what?" 

"my wife, my wife. poor millie, poor millie. i can't remember anything. i think of her hands but 
i don't see them doing anything at all. they just hang there at her sides or they lie there on her 
lap or there's a cigarette in them, but that's all." 
montag turned and glanced back. 
what did you give to the city, montag? 
ashes. 

what did the others give to each other? 
nothingness. 

granger stood looking back with montag. "everyone must leave something behind when he dies, 
my grandfather said. a child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes 
made. or a garden planted. something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere 
to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you're there. it 
doesn't matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before

granger moved his hand. "my grandfather showed me some v-2 rocket films once, fifty years 
ago. have you ever seen the atom-bomb mushroom from two hundred miles up? it's a pinprick, 
it's nothing. with the wilderness all around it. 

"my grandfather ran off the v-2 rocket film a dozen times and then hoped that some day our 
cities would open up and let the green and the land and the wilderness in more, to remind people 
that we're allotted a little space on earth and that we survive in that wilderness

turned to montag. "grandfather's been dead for all these years, but if you lifted my skull, by

montag sat up. 

he did not move any further, however. the other men did likewise. the sun was touching the 

black horizon with a faint red tip. the air was cold and smelled of a coming rain. 

silently, granger arose, felt his arms, and legs, swearing, swearing incessantly under his breath, 

tears dripping from his face. he shuffled down to the river to look upstream. 

"it's flat," he said, a long time later. "city looks like a heap of baking-powder. it's gone." and a 

long time after that. "i wonder how many knew it was coming? i wonder how many were 

surprised?" 

and across the world, thought montag, how many other cities dead? and here in our country, 

how many? a hundred, a thousand?

ne struck a match and touched it to a piece of dry paper taken from their pocket, and 

shoved this under a bit of grass and leaves, and after a while added tiny twigs which were wet 

and sputtered but finally caught, and the fire grew larger in the early morning as the sun came up 

and the men slowly turned from looking up river and were drawn to the fire, awkwardly, with 

nothing to say, and the sun coloured the backs of their necks as they bent down. 

granger unfolded an oilskin with some bacon in it. "we'll have a bite. then we'll turn around 

and walk upstream. they'll be needing us up that way." 

someone produced a small frying-pan and the bacon went into it and the frying-pan was set on 

the fire. after a moment the bacon began to flutter and dance in the pan and the sputter of it 

filled the morning air with its aroma. the men watched this ritual silently. 

granger looked into the fire. "phoenix." 

"what?" 

"there was a silly damn bird c

we know the damn silly thing we just did. we know all the damn silly things we've done for a 

thousand years, and as long as we know that and always have it around where we can see it, 

some day we'll stop making the goddam funeral pyres and jumping into the middle of them. we 

pick up a few more people that remember, every generation." 

he took the pan off the fire and let the bacon cool and they ate it, slowly, thoughtfully. 

"now, let's get on upstream," said granger. "and hold on to one thought: you're not important. 

you're not anything. some day the load we're carrying with us may help someone. but even 

when we had the books on hand, a long time ago, we didn't use what we got out of them. we 

went right on insulting the dead. we went right on spitting in the graves of all the poor ones who 

died before us. we're going to meet a lot of lonely people in the next week and the next month 

and the next year. and when they ask us what we're doing, you ca

they finished eating and put out the fire. the day was brightening all about them as if a pink 

lamp had been given more wick. in the trees, the birds that had flown away now came back and 

settled down. 



montag began walking and after a moment found that the others had fallen in behind him, going 
north. he was surprised, and moved aside to let granger pass, but granger looked at him and 
nodded him on. montag went ahead. he looked at the river and the sky and the rusting track 
going back down to where the farms lay, where the barns stood full of hay, where a lot of people 
had walked by in the night on their way from the city. later, in a month or six months, and 
certainly not more than a year, he would walk along here again, alone, and keep right on going 
until he caught up with the people. 

but now there was a long morning's walk until
