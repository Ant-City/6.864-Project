could be hurried.

we were approaching a castle which stood on high ground; a huge,
strong, venerable structure, whose gray towers and battlements were
charmingly draped with ivy, and whose whole majestic mass was
drenched with splendors flung from the sinking sun.  it was the
largest castle we had seen, and so i thought it might be the one
we were after, but sandy said no.  she did not know who owned it;
she said she had passed it without calling, when she went down
to camelot.



chapter xvi

morgan le fay

if knights errant were to be believed, not all castles were desirable
places to seek hospitality in.  as a matter of fact, knights errant
were _not_ persons to be believed--that is, measured by modern
standards of veracity; yet, measured by the standards of their own
time, and scaled accordingly, you got the truth.  it was very
simple: you discounted a statement ninety-seven per cent; the rest
was fact.  now after making this allowance, the truth remained
that if i could find out something abo

nywhere else, but he said he wanted plenty of air; and
he was always complaining that a palace was no place for a soap
factory anyway, and said if a man was to start one in his house
he would be damned if he wouldn’t strangle him.  there were ladies
present, too, but much these people ever cared for that; they would
swear before children, if the wind was their way when the factory
was going.

this missionary knight’s name was la cote male taile, and he said
that this castle was the abode of morgan le fay, sister of
king arthur, and wife of king uriens, monarch of a realm about
as big as the district of columbia--you could stand in the middle
of it and throw bricks into the next kingdom.  “kings” and “kingdoms”
 were as thick in britain as they had been in little palestine in
joshua’s time, when people had to sleep with their knees pulled up
because they couldn’t stretch out without a passport.

la cote was much depressed, for he had scored here the worst
failure of his campaign.  he

f her eye on the servants to see that they made
no balks in handling the body and getting it out; when they came
with fresh clean towels, she sent back for the other kind; and
when they had finished wiping the floor and were going, she indicated
a crimson fleck the size of a tear which their duller eyes had
overlooked.  it was plain to me that la cote male taile had failed
to see the mistress of the house.  often, how louder and clearer
than any tongue, does dumb circumstantial evidence speak.

morgan le fay rippled along as musically as ever.  marvelous woman.
and what a glance she had: when it fell in reproof upon those
servants, they shrunk and quailed as timid people do when the
lightning flashes out of a cloud.  i could have got the habit
myself.  it was the same with that poor old brer uriens; he was
always on the ragged edge of apprehension; she could not even turn
toward him but he winced.

in the midst of the talk i let drop a complimentary word about
king arthur, forgetting for the moment

men and women, and some of them married and experimenting familywise
themselves--for not a soul of the tribe was dead!  conceive of the
ingenious devilishness of that queen: she had a special hatred for
this prisoner, and she had _invented_ all those funerals herself,
to scorch his heart with; and the sublimest stroke of genius of
the whole thing was leaving the family-invoice a funeral _short_,
so as to let him wear his poor old soul out guessing.

but for me, he never would have got out.  morgan le fay hated him
with her whole heart, and she never would have softened toward him.
and yet his crime was committed more in thoughtlessness than
deliberate depravity.  he had said she had red hair.  well, she
had; but that was no way to speak of it.  when red-headed people
are above a certain social grade their hair is auburn.

consider it: among these forty-seven captives there were five
whose names, offenses, and dates of incarceration were no longer
known!  one woman and four men--all bent, and wr

shot over their heads.  the queen was just one of that sort, and
was always making the stupidest blunders by reason of it.  she
hesitated a moment; then her face brightened up with sudden
comprehension, and she said she would do it for me.

i thought to myself: she? why what can she know about photography?
but it was a poor time to be thinking.  when i looked around, she
was moving on the procession with an axe!

well, she certainly was a curious one, was morgan le fay.  i have
seen a good many kinds of women in my time, but she laid over them
all for variety.  and how sharply characteristic of her this episode
was.  she had no more idea than a horse of how to photograph
a procession; but being in doubt, it was just like her to try
to do it with an axe.

“no, it’s not your head, sandy.  your head’s all right, as far as
it goes, but you don’t know business; that’s where the trouble
is.  it unfits you to argue about business, and you’re wrong
to be always trying.  however, that aside, it was a good haul,
anyway, and will breed a handsome crop of reputation in arthur’s
court.  and speaking of the cowboys, what a curious country this
is for women and men that never get old.  now there’s morgan le fay,
as fresh and young as a vassar pullet, to all appearances, and
here is this old duke of the south marches still slashing away with
sword and lance at his time of life, after raising such a family
as he has raised.  as i understand it, sir gawaine killed seven
of his sons, and still he had six left for sir marhaus and me to
take into camp.  and then there was that damsel of sixty winter
of age still excursioning around in her frosty bloom--how old
are you, sandy?”
