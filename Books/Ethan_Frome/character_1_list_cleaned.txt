[CHARACTER] - 
                 ethan's
sickly wife, more commonly known as "zeena." she comes across as
prematurely aged, caustic in temperament, prone to alternating fits
of silence and rage, and utterly unattractive, making her the novel's
least sympathetic figure. she is acutely interested in the treatment
of her own illness, displaying a degree of hypochondria (imagined
illness or minor symptoms secretly relished and exaggerated by the
patient). despite zeena's apparent physical weakness, she, not ethan,
holds the dominant position in their household.
