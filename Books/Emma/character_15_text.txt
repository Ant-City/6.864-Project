â€œare you expecting miss fairfax here soon?â€
â€œoh yes; next week.â€
â€œindeed!â€”that must be a very great pleasure.â€
â€œthank you. you are very kind. yes, next week. every body is so surprized; and every body says the same obliging things. i am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at highbury, as they can be to see her. yes, friday or saturday; she cannot say which, because colonel campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days. so very good of them to send her the whole way! but they always do, you know. oh yes, friday or saturday next. that is what she writes about. that is the reason of her writing out of rule, as we call it; for, in the common course, we should not have heard from her before next tuesday or wednesday.â€
â€œyes, so i imagined. i was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of miss fairfax to-day.â€

y, the charge, the consolation, the foundling of her grandmother and aunt, there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there; of her being taught only what very limited means could command, and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person, good understanding, and warm-hearted, well-meaning relations.
but the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny. this was colonel campbell, who had very highly regarded fairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man; and farther, had been indebted to him for such attentions, during a severe camp-fever, as he believed had saved his life. these were claims which he did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away from the death of poor fairfax, before his own return to england put any thing in his power. when he did return, he sought out the child and took notice of her. he was a married man, with only one liv

ing child, a girl, about janeâ€™s age: and jane became their guest, paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years old, his daughterâ€™s great fondness for her, and his own wish of being a real friend, united to produce an offer from colonel campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education. it was accepted; and from that period jane had belonged to colonel campbellâ€™s family, and had lived with them entirely, only visiting her grandmother from time to time.
the plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible. to provide for her otherwise was out of colonel campbellâ€™s power; for though his income, by pay and appointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughterâ€™s; but, by giving her an education, he hoped to be supply

such was jane fairfaxâ€™s history. she had fallen into good hands, known nothing but kindness from the campbells, and been given an excellent education. living constantly with right-minded and well-informed people, her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture; and colonel campbellâ€™s residence being in london, every lighter talent had been done full justice to, by the attendance of first-rate masters. her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she was, as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children, fully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she was too much beloved to be parted with. neither father nor mother could promote, and the daughter could not endure it. the

â€œvery true, miss woodhouse, so she will. he is the very best young manâ€”but, my dear jane, if you remember, i told you yesterday he was precisely the height of mr. perry. miss hawkins,â€”i dare say, an excellent young woman. his extreme attention to my motherâ€”wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the better, for my mother is a little deaf, you knowâ€”it is not much, but she does not hear quite quick. jane says that colonel campbell is a little deaf. he fancied bathing might be good for itâ€”the warm bathâ€”but she says it did him no lasting benefit. colonel campbell, you know, is quite our angel. and mr. dixon seems a very charming young man, quite worthy of him. it is such a happiness when good people get togetherâ€”and they always do. now, here will be mr. elton and miss hawkins; and there are the coles, such very good people; and the perrysâ€”i suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than mr. and mrs. perr

on my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself. but her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is so very reserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about any body, that i really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her.â€
â€œmay i, indeed?â€”then i will speak the truth, and nothing suits me so well. i met her frequently at weymouth. i had known the campbells a little in town; and at weymouth we were very much in the same set. colonel campbell is a very agreeable man, and mrs. campbell a friendly, warm-hearted woman. i like them all.â€
â€œyou know miss fairfaxâ€™s situation in life, i conclude; what she is destined to be?â€
â€œyesâ€”(rather hesitatingly)â€”i believe i do.â€
â€œyou get upon delicate subjects, emma,â€ said mrs. weston smiling; â€œremember that i am here.â€”mr. frank churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of miss fairfaxâ€™s situation in life. i will move a little farther off.â€

h ensued of surprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her side, and explanations on miss batesâ€™s, was, that this pianoforte had arrived from broadwoodâ€™s the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt and nieceâ€”entirely unexpected; that at first, by miss batesâ€™s account, jane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered itâ€”but now, they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter;â€”of course it must be from colonel campbell.
â€œone can suppose nothing else,â€ added mrs. cole, â€œand i was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt. but jane, it seems, had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about it. she knows their ways best; but i should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present. they might chuse to surprize her.â€
mrs. cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from colone

t it to a better use than we can; and that really is the reason why the instrument was boughtâ€”or else i am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.â€”we are in great hopes that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening.â€
miss woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of mrs. coleâ€™s, turned to frank churchill.
â€œwhy do you smile?â€ said she.
â€œnay, why do you?â€
â€œme!â€”i suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbellâ€™s being so rich and so liberal.â€”it is a handsome present.â€
â€œvery.â€
â€œi rather wonder that it was never made before.â€
â€œperhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before.â€
â€œor that he did not give her the use of their own instrumentâ€”which must now be shut up in london, untouched by any body.â€
â€œthat is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large for mrs. batesâ€™s house.â€

â€œi do not know. i rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than i deserve. i smile because you smile, and shall probably suspect whatever i find you suspect; but at present i do not see what there is to question. if colonel campbell is not the person, who can be?â€
â€œwhat do you say to mrs. dixon?â€
â€œmrs. dixon! very true indeed. i had not thought of mrs. dixon. she must know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be; and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a young womanâ€™s scheme than an elderly manâ€™s. it is mrs. dixon, i dare say. i told you that your suspicions would guide mine.â€
â€œif so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend mr. dixon in them.â€

â€œno, i am sure it is not from the campbells. miss fairfax knows it is not from the campbells, or they would have been guessed at first. she would not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them. i may not have convinced you perhaps, but i am perfectly convinced myself that mr. dixon is a principal in the business.â€
â€œindeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced. your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely. at first, while i supposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver, i saw it only as paternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world. but when you mentioned mrs. dixon, i felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship. and now i can see it in no other light than as an offering of love.â€
there was no occasion to press the matter farther. the conviction seemed real; he looked as if he felt it. she said no more, other subjects took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; the de

 husband of her friend.
in so large a party it was not necessary that emma should approach her. she did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much in the secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair, and therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, the subject was almost immediately introduced, and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received, the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of â€œmy excellent friend colonel campbell.â€
mrs. weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested by the circumstance, and emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible, which she plainly read in the fair heroineâ€™s countenance.
they were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of the early was frank churchill. in he walked, the

â€œthis present from the campbells,â€ said sheâ€”â€œthis pianoforte is very kindly given.â€
â€œyes,â€ he replied, and without the smallest apparent embarrassment.â€”â€œbut they would have done better had they given her notice of it. surprizes are foolish things. the pleasure is not enhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable. i should have expected better judgment in colonel campbell.â€
from that moment, emma could have taken her oath that mr. knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument. but whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachmentâ€”whether there were no actual preferenceâ€”remained a little longer doubtful. towards the end of janeâ€™s second song, her voice grew thick.
â€œthat will do,â€ said he, when it was finished, thinking aloudâ€”â€œyou have sung quite enough for one eveningâ€”now be quiet.â€
another song, however, was soon begged for. â€œo

â€œi am here on no business of my own,â€ said emma; â€œi am only waiting for my friend. she will probably have soon done, and then we shall go home. but you had better go with mrs. weston and hear the instrument.â€
â€œwellâ€”if you advise it.â€”but (with a smile) if colonel campbell should have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to have an indifferent toneâ€”what shall i say? i shall be no support to mrs. weston. she might do very well by herself. a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips, but i am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood.â€

erformance; and emma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.
at last jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to. mrs. weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; emma joined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.
â€œwhoever colonel campbell might employ,â€ said frank churchill, with a smile at emma, â€œthe person has not chosen ill. i heard a good deal of colonel campbellâ€™s taste at weymouth; and the softness of the upper notes i am sure is exactly what he and all that party would particularly prize. i dare say, miss fairfax, that he either gave his friend very minute directions, or wrote to broadwood himself. do not you think so?â€
jane did not look round. she was not obliged to hear. mrs. weston had been speaking to her at t

â€œit is not fair,â€ said emma, in a whisper; â€œmine was a random guess. do not distress her.â€
he shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy. soon afterwards he began again,
â€œhow much your friends in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion, miss fairfax. i dare say they often think of you, and wonder which will be the day, the precise day of the instrumentâ€™s coming to hand. do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time?â€”do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him, or that he may have sent only a general direction, an order indefinite as to time, to depend upon contingencies and conveniences?â€
he paused. she could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,
â€œtill i have a letter from colonel campbell,â€ said she, in a voice of forced calmness, â€œi can imagine nothing with any confidence. it must be all conjecture.

â€œwhat felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one happy!â€”if i mistake not that was danced at weymouth.â€
she looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played something else. he took some music from a chair near the pianoforte, and turning to emma, said,
â€œhere is something quite new to me. do you know it?â€”cramer.â€”and here are a new set of irish melodies. that, from such a quarter, one might expect. this was all sent with the instrument. very thoughtful of colonel campbell, was not it?â€”he knew miss fairfax could have no music here. i honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart. nothing hastily done; nothing incomplete. true affection only could have prompted it.â€
emma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused; and when on glancing her eye towards jane fairfax she caught the remains of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness, there had been a smile of s

endly inquiry after miss fairfax, she hoped, might lead the way to a return of old feelings. the touch seemed immediate.
â€œah! miss woodhouse, how kind you are!â€”i suppose you have heardâ€”and are come to give us joy. this does not seem much like joy, indeed, in meâ€”(twinkling away a tear or two)â€”but it will be very trying for us to part with her, after having had her so long, and she has a dreadful headache just now, writing all the morning:â€”such long letters, you know, to be written to colonel campbell, and mrs. dixon. â€˜my dear,â€™ said i, â€˜you will blind yourselfâ€™â€”for tears were in her eyes perpetually. one cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. it is a great change; and though she is amazingly fortunateâ€”such a situation, i suppose, as no young woman before ever met with on first going outâ€”do not think us ungrateful, miss woodhouse, for such surprising good fortuneâ€”(again dispersing her tears)â€”but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what a headache she has. when one is in great pa

sations of the past, obliged her to admit that jane might very naturally resolve on seeing mrs. cole or any other steady friend, when she might not bear to see herself. she spoke as she felt, with earnest regret and solicitudeâ€”sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from miss bates to be now actually determined on, might be as much for miss fairfaxâ€™s advantage and comfort as possible. â€œit must be a severe trial to them all. she had understood it was to be delayed till colonel campbellâ€™s return.â€
â€œso very kind!â€ replied miss bates. â€œbut you are always kind.â€
there was no bearing such an â€œalways;â€ and to break through her dreadful gratitude, emma made the direct inquiry ofâ€”

â€œyes, our good mrs. elton. the most indefatigable, true friend. she would not take a denial. she would not let jane say, â€˜no;â€™ for when jane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the very morning we were at donwell,) when jane first heard of it, she was quite decided against accepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention; exactly as you say, she had made up her mind to close with nothing till colonel campbellâ€™s return, and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at presentâ€”and so she told mrs. elton over and over againâ€”and i am sure i had no more idea that she would change her mind!â€”but that good mrs. elton, whose judgment never fails her, saw farther than i did. it is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did, and refuse to take janeâ€™s answer; but she positively declared she would not write any such denial yesterday, as jane wished her; she woul

â€œaye, i see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. what is to become of that?â€”very true. poor dear jane was talking of it just now.â€”â€˜you must go,â€™ said she. â€˜you and i must part. you will have no business here.â€”let it stay, however,â€™ said she; â€˜give it houseroom till colonel campbell comes back. i shall talk about it to him; he will settle for me; he will help me out of all my difficulties.â€™â€”and to this day, i do believe, she knows not whether it was his present or his daughterâ€™s.â€
now emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing, that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough; and, with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of th
