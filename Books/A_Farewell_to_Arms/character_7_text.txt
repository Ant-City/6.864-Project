ilan." 

"he's a first captain, isn't he?" 

"yes, but he is an excellent surgeon." 

"i don't want my leg fooled with by a first captain. 
if he was any good he would be made a major. i 
know what a first captain is, doctor." 

"he is an excellent surgeon and i would rather have 
his judgment than any surgeon i know." 

"could another surgeon see it?" 

"certainly if you wish. but i would take dr. va- 
rella's opinion myself." 

"could you ask another surgeon to come and see 
it?" 

"i will ask valentini to come." 

"who is he?" 

"he is a surgeon of the ospedale maggiore." 

"good. i appreciate it very much. you understand, 
doctor, i couldn't stay in bed six months." 

"you would not be in bed. you would first take a 
sun cure. then you could have light exercise. then 
when it was encysted we would operate." 

"but i can't wait six months." 

the doctor spread his delicate fingers on the cap he 
held and smiled. "you are in such a hurry to get back 
to the front?" 

"why not?"

"it is very beautiful," he said. "you are a noble 
young man." he stooped over and kissed me very del- 
icately on the forehead. "i will send for valentini. 
do not worry and excite yourself. be a good boy." 

"will you have a drink?" i asked. 

"no thank you. i never drink alcohol." 

"just have one." i rang for the porter to bring 
glasses. 

"no. no thank you. they are waiting for me." 

"good-by," i said. 

"good-by." 

two hours later dr. valentini came into the room. 
he was in a great hurry and the points of his mustache 
stood straight up. he was a major, his face was 
tanned and he laughed all the time. 

"how did you do it, this rotten thing?" he asked. 
"let me see the plates. yes. yes. that's it. you look 
healthy as a goat. who's the pretty girl? is she your 
girl? i thought so. isn't this a bloody war? how 
does that feel ? you are a fine boy. i'll make you bet- 
ter than new. does that hurt? you bet it hurts.

her. i will be a patient here myself. no, but i will do 
all your maternity work free. does she understand 
that ? she will make you a fine boy. a fine blonde like 
she is. that's fine. that's all right. what a lovely 
girl. ask her if she eats supper with me. no i won't 
take her away from you. thank you. thank you very 
much, miss. that's all." 

"that's all i want to know." he patted me on the 
shoulder. "leave the dressings off."

" will you have a drink, dr. valentini ?" 
"a drink? certainly. i will have ten drinks. 
where are they?" 

"in the armoire. miss barkley will get the bottle." 
"cheery oh. cheery oh to you, miss. what a 
lovely girl. i will bring you better cognac than that." 
he wiped his mustache. 

"when do you think it can be operated on?" 
"to-morrow morning. not before. your stomach 
must be emptied. you must be washed out. i will see 
the old lady downstairs and leave instructions. good- 
by. i see you to-morrow. i'll bring you better cognac

a farewell to arms 109 

"i wish we could go for a walk," catherine said. 
"i'd wheel you if we had a chair." 

"how would i get into the chair?" 

"we'd do it." 

"we could go out to the park and have breakfast 
outdoors." i looked out the open doorway. 

"what we'll really do," she said, "is get you ready 
for your friend dr. valentini." 

"i thought he was grand." 

"i didn't like him as much as you did. but i imag- 
ine he's very good." 

"come back to bed, catherine. please," i said. 

"i can't. didn't we have a lovely night?" 

"and can you be on night duty to-night?" 

"i probably will. but you won't want me." 

"yes, i will." 

"no, you won't. you've never been operated on. 
you don't know how you'll be." 

"i'll be all right." 

"you'll be sick and i won't be anything to you." 

"come back then now." 

"no," she said.

e sleeve of my coat. 
i did not want to look conspicuous. i knew i would 
have to get out before they got to mestre because they 
would be taking care of these guns. they had no guns 
to lose or forget about. i was terrifically hungry. 



chapter xxxii 

lying on the floor of the flat-car with the guns be- 
side me under the canvas i was wet, cold and very hun- 
gry. finally i rolled over and lay flat on my stomach 
with my head on my arms. my knee was stiff, but it 
had been very satisfactory. valentini had done a fine 
job. i had done half the retreat on foot and swum part 
of the tagliamento with his knee. it was his knee all 
right. the other knee was mine. doctors did things 
to you and then it was not your body any more. the 
head was mine, and the inside of the belly. it was very 
hungry in there. i could feel it turn over on itself. the 
head was mine, but not to use, not to think with ; only 
to remember and not too much remember. 

i could remember catherine but i knew i would get
