why i live at the p.o.


i was getting along fine with mama, papa-daddy and uncle rondo until my sister stella-rondo just separated from her husband and came back home again. mr. whitaker! of course i went with mr. whitaker first, when he first appeared here in china grove, taking "pose yourself" photos, and stella-rondo broke us up. told him i was one-sided. bigger on one side than the other, which is a deliberate, calculated falsehood: i'm the same. stella-rondo is exactly twelve months to the day younger than i am and for that reason she's spoiled.
   she's always had anything

   so papa-daddy says, "i am going out and lie in the hammock, and you can all sit here and remember my words: i'll never cut off my beard as long as i live, even one inch, and i don't appreciate it in you at all." passed right by me in the hall and went straight out and got in the hammock.
   it would be a holiday. it wasn't five minutes before uncle rondo suddenly appeared in the hall in one of stella-rondo's flesh-colored kimonos, all cut on the bias, like something mr. whitaker probably thought was gorgeous.
   "uncle rondo!" i says. "i didn't know who that was! where are you going?"
   "sister," he says, "get out of my way, i'm poisoned."
   "if you're poisoned stay away from papa-daddy," i says. "keep out of the hammock. papa-daddy will certainly beat you on the head if you come within forty miles of him. he thinks i deliberately said he oug

ht to cut off his beard after he got me the p.o., and i've told him and told him and told him, and he acts like he just don't hear me. papa-daddy must of gone stone deaf.'
   "he picked a fine day to do it then," says uncle rondo, and before you could say "jack robinson" flew out in the yard.
   what he'd really done, he'd drunk another bottle of that prescription. he does it every single fourth of july as sure as shooting, and it's horribly expensive. then he falls over in the hammock and snores. so he insisted on zigzagging right on out to the hammock, looking like a half-wit.
   papa-daddy woke up with this horrible yell and right there without moving an inch he tried to turn uncle rondo against me. i heard every wor

d he said. oh, he told uncle rondo i didn't learn to read till i was eight years old and he didn't see how in the world i ever got the mail put up at the p.o., much less read it all, and he said if uncle rondo could only fathom the lengths he had gone to to get me that job! and he said on the other hand he thought stella-rondo had a brilliant mind and deserved credit for getting out of town. all the time he was just lying there swinging as pretty as you please and looping out his beard, and poor uncle rondo was pleading  with him to slow down the hammock, it was making him as dizzy as a witch to watch it. but that's what papa-daddy likes about a hammock. so uncle rondo was too dizzy to get turned aga

inst me for the time being. he's mama's only brother and is a good case of a one-track mind. ask anybody. a certified pharmacist.
   just then i heard stella-rondo raising the upstairs window. while she was married she got this peculiar idea that it's cooler with the windows shut and locked. so she has to raise the window before she can make a soul hear her outdoors.
   so she raises the window and says, "oh!" you would have thought she was mortally wounded.
   uncle rondo and papa-daddy didn't even look up, but kept right on with what they were doing. i had to laugh.
   i flew up the stairs and threw the door open! i says, "what in the wide world's the matter, stella-rondo? you mortally wounded?"
   "no," she says, "i am not mortally wounded but i wish you would do me the favor of looking out that window there and telling me what you see."
   so i shade my eyes and look out the window.
   "i see the front yard," i says.
   "don't you see any human beings?'' she

says.
   "i see uncle rondo trying to run papa-daddy out of the hammock," i says. "nothing more. naturally, it's so suffocating-hot in the house, with all the windows shut and locked, everybody who cares to stay in their right mind will have to go out and get in the hammock before the fourth of july is over."
   "don't you notice anything different about uncle rondo?" asks stella-rondo.
   "why, no, except he's got on some terrible-looking flesh-colored contraption i wouldn't be found dead in, is all i can see," i says.
   "never mind, you won't be found dead in it, because it happens to be part of my trousseau, and mr. whitaker took several dozen photographs of me in it," says stella-rondo. "what on earth could uncle rondo mean  by wearing part of my trousseau out in the broad open daylight without saying so much as 'kiss my foot,' knowing  i only got hom

e this morning after my separation and hung my negligee up on the bathroom door, just as nervous as i could be?"
   "i'm sure i don't know, and what do you expect me to do about it?" i says. "jump out the window?"
   "no, i expect nothing of the kind. i simply declare that uncle rondo looks like a fool in it, that's all," she says. "it makes me sick to my stomach."
   "well, he looks as good as he can," i says. "as good as anybody in reason could." i stood up for uncle rondo, please remember. and i said to stella-rondo, "i think i would do well not to criticize so freely if i were you and came home with a two-year-old child i had never said a word about, and no explanation whatever about my separation."
   "i asked you the instant i entered this house not to refer one more time to my adopted child, and you gave me your word of honor you would not," was all stella-rondo would say, and started pulling out every one of her eyebrows with some cheap kress tweezers.

o i merely slammed the door behind me and went down and made some green-tomato pickle. somebody had to do it. of course mama had turned both the negroes loose; she always said no earthly power could hold one anyway on the fourth of july, so she wouldn't even try. it turned out that jaypan fell in the lake and came within a very narrow limit of drowning.
   so mama trots in. lifts up the lid and says, "h'm! not very good for your uncle rondo in his precarious condition, i must say. or poor little adopted shirley-t. shame on you!"
   that made me tired. i says, "well, stella-rondo had better thank her lucky stars it was her instead of me came trotting in with that very peculiar-looking child. now if it had been me that trotted in from illinois and brought a peculiar-looking child of two, i shudder to think of the reception i'd of got, much less controlled the diet of an entire family."
   "but you must remember, sister, that you wer

shirley-t."
   "apologize for what?" i says. "i merely wondered if the child was normal, that's all. now that she's proved she is, why, i have nothing further to say."
   but mama just turned on her heel and flew out, furious. she ran right upstairs and hugged the baby. she believed it was adopted. stella-rondo hadn't done a thing but turn her against me from upstairs while i stood there helpless over the hot stove. so that made mama, papa-daddy and the baby all on stella-rondo's side.
   next, uncle rondo.
   i must say that uncle rondo has been marvelous to me at various times in the past and i was completely unprepared to be made to jump out of my skin, the way it turned out. once stella-rondo did something perfectly horrible to him  -  broke a chain letter from flanders field  -  and he took the radio back he had given her and gave it to me. stella-rondo was furious! for six months we all had to call her stella instead of stella-rondo, or she wouldn't answer. i always thought uncle rondo had

all the brains of the entire family. another time he sent me to mammoth cave, with all expenses paid.
   but this would be the day he was drinking that prescription, the fourth of july.
   so at supper stella-rondo speaks up and says she thinks uncle rondo ought to try to eat a little something. so finally uncle rondo said he would try a little cold biscuits and ketchup, but that was all. so she  brought it to him.
   "do you think it wise to disport with ketchup in stella-rondo's flesh-colored kimono?'' i says. trying to be considerate! if stella-rondo couldn't watch out for her trousseau, somebody had to.
   "any objections?" asks uncle rondo, just about to pour out all the ketchup.
   "don't mind what she says, uncle rondo," says stella-rondo. "sister has been devoting this solid afternoon to sneering out

 my bedroom window at the way you look."
   "what's that?" says unde rondo. uncle rondo has got the most terrible temper in the world. anything is liable to make him tear the house down if it comes at the wrong time.
   so stella-rondo says, "sister says, 'uncle rondo certainly does look like a fool in that pink kimono!' "
   do you remember who it was really said that?
   unde rondo spills out all the ketchup and jumps out of his chair and tears off the kimono and throws it down on the dirty floor and puts his foot on it. it had to be sent all the way to jackson to the cleaners and re-pleated.
   "so that's your opinion of your uncle rondo, is it?" he says. "i look like a fool, do i? well, that's the last straw. a whole day in this house with nothing to do,

 and then to hear you come out with a remark like that behind my back!''
   "i didn't say any such of a thing, uncle rondo," i says, "and i'm not saying who did, either. why, i think you look all right. just try to take care of yourself and not talk and eat at the same time," i says. "i think you better go lie down."
   "lie down my foot," says uncle rondo. i ought to of known by that he was fixing to do something perfectly horrible.
   so he didn't do anything that night in the precarious state he was in  -  just played casino with mama and stella-rondo and shirley-t. and gave shirley-t. a nickel with a head on both sides. it tickled her nearly to death, and she called him "papa." but at 6:30 a.m. the next morning, he threw a whole five-cent package of some unsold one-inch firecrackers from the store as hard as he could into my bedroom and they

to what i was up to. i didn't try to conceal it.
   the first thing they knew, i marched in where they were all playing old maid and pulled the electric oscillating fan out by the plug, and everything got real hot. next i snatched the pillow i'd done the needlepoint on right off the davenport from behind papa-daddy. he went ''ugh!" i beat stella-rondo up the stairs and finally found my charm bracelet in her bureau drawer under a picture of nelson eddy.
   "so that's the way the land lies," says uncle rondo. there he was, piecing on the ham. "well, sister, i'll be glad to donate my army cot if you got any place to set it up, providing you'll leave right this minute and let me get some peace." uncle rondo was in france.
   "thank you kindly for the cot and 'peace' is hardly the word i would select if i had to resort to firecrackers at 6:30 a.m. in a young girl's bedroom," i says back to him. "and as to where i intend to go, you seem to forget my position as postmistress of china grove, mississippi,

rday. i'm going to the p.o. and the only way you can possibly see me is to visit me there."
   so papa-daddy says, "you'll never catch me setting foot in that post office, even if i should take a notion into my head to write a letter some place." he says, "i won't have you reachin' out of that little old window with a pair of shears and cuttin' off any beard of mine. i'm too smart for you!"
   "we all are," says stella-rondo.
   but i said, "if you're so smart, where's mr. whitaker?"
   so then uncle rondo says, "i'll thank you from now on to stop reading all the orders i get on postcards and telling everybody in china grove what you think is the matter with them," but i says, "i draw my own conclusions and will continue in the future to draw them." i says, "if people want to write their inmost secrets on penny postcards, there's nothing in the wide world you can do about it, uncle rondo."
   "and if you think we'll ever write  another postcard you're sadly mistaken," says mama.
   "cutting off y

our nose to spite your face then," i says. "but if you're all determined to have no more to do with the u.s. mail, think of this: what will stella-rondo do now, if she wants to tell mr. whitaker to come after her?"
   "wah!" says stella-rondo. i knew she'd cry. she had a conniption fit right there in the kitchen.
   "it will be interesting to see how long she holds out," i says. "and
now  -  i am leaving."
   "good-bye," says uncle rondo.
   "oh, i declare," says mama, "to think that a family of mine should quarrel on the fourth of july, or the day after, over stella-rondo leaving old mr. whitaker and having the sweetest little adopted child! it looks like we'd all be glad!"
   "wah!" says stella-rondo, and has a fresh conniption fit.
   "he  left her   -  you mark my words," i says. "that's mr. whitaker. i know mr. whitaker. after all, i knew him first. i said from the beginning he'd up and leave her. i foretold every single t

hing that's happened."
   "where did he go?" asks mama.
   "probably to the north pole, if he knows what's good for him," i says.
   but stella-rondo just bawled and wouldn't say another word. she flew to her room and slammed the door.
   "now look what you've gone and done, sister," says mama. "you go apologize."
   "i haven't got time, i'm leaving," i says.
   "well, what are you waiting around for?" asks uncle rondo.
   so i just picked up the kitchen clock and marched off, without saying "kiss my foot" or anything, and never did tell stella-rondo good-bye.
   there was a girl going along on a little wagon right in front.
   "girl," i says, "come help me haul these things down the hill, i'm going to live in the post office."
   took her nine trips in her express wagon. uncle rondo came out on the porch and threw her a nickel.
   and that's the last i've laid eyes on any of my family or my family laid eyes
