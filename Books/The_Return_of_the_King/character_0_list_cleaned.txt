[CHARACTER] - 
                     the
brave but unassuming hobbit who bears the ring back to mordor. frodo
has a quiet determination and a strength of character that establish
his distinctive heroism. increasingly affected and burdened by the ring's
power, frodo assumes a more passive role in the return of
the king than in the first two volumes of the lord
of the rings. nonetheless, frodo's ultimate struggle to
overcome the temptation and burden of the ring reminds us that an
individual with less courage and moral fiber would be unable to
complete the quest.
