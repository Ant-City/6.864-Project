on  is  enormous,  the  fundamental  minimal
energies are, on the usual scales of elementary particle physics, similarly huge. they are multiples of
what is known as the planck energy. to get a sense of scale, if we translate the planck energy into a

mass using einstein's famous conversion formula e = mc2, they correspond to masses that are on the
order  of  ten  billion  billion  (1019)  times  that  of  a  proton.  this  gargantuan  mass—by  elementary
particle standards—is known as the planck mass; it's about equal to the mass of a grain of dust or a
collection of a million average bacteria. and so, the typical mass-equivalent of a vibrating loop in
string theory is generally some whole number (1, 2, 3,. . .) times the planck mass. physicists often
express this by saying that the "natural" or "typical" energy scale (and hence mass scale) of string
theory is the planck scale.

this raises a crucial question directly related to the goal of reproducing the particle properties

ore symmetric union when the temperature of the universe dropped
to about a million billion degrees above absolute zero (1015 kelvin), georgi and glashow showed
that the union with the strong force would have been apparent only at a temperature some ten trillion
times higher—around ten billion billion billion degrees above absolute zero (1028 kelvin). from the
point of view of energy, this is about a million billion times the mass of the proton, or about four
orders of magnitude less than the planck mass. georgi and glashow boldly took theoretical physics
into  an  energy  realm  many  orders  of  magnitude  beyond  that  which  anyone  had  previously  dared
explore.

subsequent work at harvard by georgi, helen quinn, and weinberg in 1974 made the potential
unity of the nongravitational forces within the grand unified framework even more manifest. as their
contribution continues to play an important role in unifying the forces and in assessing the relevance
of supersymmetry to the natural worl

re for string theory.

as with the situation with superpartners, no such exotically charged particles have ever been
observed, and our understanding of string theory does not allow for a definitive prediction of their
masses should the extra dimensions have the correct properties to generate them. one explanation for
not seeing them, again, is that if they do exist, their masses must be beyond our present technological
means—in fact, it is likely that their masses would be on the order of the planck mass. but should a
future experiment come across such exotic electric charges, it would constitute very strong evidence
for string theory.

some longer shots

there are yet other ways in which evidence for string theory might be found. for example, witten has
pointed out the long-shot possibility that astronomers might one day see a direct signature of string
theory in the data they collect from observing the heavens. as encountered in chapter 6, the size of a
string is typically the planck length,

ensional extended objects—are special for
the following reason. physicists have shown that the mass of the extended objects of every dimension
except  for  one-dimensional  strings  is inversely  proportional  to  the  value  of  the  associated  string
coupling constant when we are in any of the five string regions of figure 12.11. this means that with
weak string coupling, in any of the five formulations, all but the strings will be enormously massive—
orders of magnitude heavier than the planck mass. because they are so heavy and, therefore, from e =
mc2, require such unimaginably high energy to be produced, branes have only a small effect on much
of physics (but not on all, as we shall see in the next chapter). however, when we venture outside the
peninsular  regions  of  figure  12.11,  the  higher-dimensional  branes  become  lighter  and  hence
increasingly important.14

and  so,  the  image  you  should  have  in  mind  is  the  following.  in  the  central  region  of  figure

relativity need be used to understand their properties. (we are here discussing the overall structure of
the black hole, not the singular central point of collapse within a black hole, whose tiny size most
certainly  requires  a  quantum-mechanical  description.) as  we  try  to  make  ever  less  massive  black
holes, however, there comes a point when they are so light and small that quantum mechanics does
comes into play. this happens if the total mass of the black hole is about the planck mass or less.
(from the point of view of elementary particle physics, the planck mass is huge—some ten billion
billion times the mass of a proton. from the point of view of black holes, though, the planck mass,
being equal to that of an average grain of dust, is quite tiny.) and so, physicists who speculated that
tiny  black  holes  and  elementary  particles  might  be  closely  related  immediately  ran  up  against  the
incompatibility  between  general  relativity—the  theoretical  heart  of
