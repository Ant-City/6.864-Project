low as a yolk. babbitt disapproved of mr. and mrs. doppelbrau as
"bohemian." from their house came midnight music and obscene laughter;
there were neighborhood rumors of bootlegged whisky and fast motor
rides. they furnished babbitt with many happy evenings of discussion,
during which he announced firmly, "i'm not strait-laced, and i don't
mind seeing a fellow throw in a drink once in a while, but when it comes
to deliberately trying to get away with a lot of hell-raising all the
while like the doppelbraus do, it's too rich for my blood!"

on the other side of babbitt lived howard littlefield, ph.d., in a
strictly modern house whereof the lower part was dark red tapestry
brick, with a leaded oriel, the upper part of pale stucco like spattered
clay, and the roof red-tiled. littlefield was the great scholar of the
neighborhood; the authority on everything in the world except babies,
cooking, and motors. he was a bachelor of arts of blodgett college,
and a doctor of philosophy in economics of yale.

d from tinka, the youngest, "oh, let's have a
sedan! mary ellen's father has got one." ted wound up, "oh, everybody's
got a closed car now, except us!"

babbitt faced them: "i guess you got nothing very terrible to complain
about! anyway, i don't keep a car just to enable you children to look
like millionaires! and i like an open car, so you can put the top down
on summer evenings and go out for a drive and get some good fresh air.
besides--a closed car costs more money."

"aw, gee whiz, if the doppelbraus can afford a closed car, i guess we
can!" prodded ted.

"humph! i make eight thousand a year to his seven! but i don't blow it
all in and waste it and throw it around, the way he does! don't believe
in this business of going and spending a whole lot of money to show off
and--"

they went, with ardor and some thoroughness, into the matters of
streamline bodies, hill-climbing power, wire wheels, chrome steel,
ignition systems, and body colors. it was much more than a study of
transportation. it w

to take a bath, too. but, say,
the babbitt men will be some lookers to-night! little theodore in a
dress-suit!"

"the babbitt men!" babbitt liked the sound of it. he put his arm about
the boy's shoulder. he wished that paul riesling had a daughter, so that
ted might marry her. "yes, your mother is kind of rouncing round, all
right," he said, and they laughed together, and sighed together, and
dutifully went in to dress.

the mckelveys were less than fifteen minutes late.

babbitt hoped that the doppelbraus would see the mckelveys' limousine,
and their uniformed chauffeur, waiting in front.

the dinner was well cooked and incredibly plentiful, and mrs. babbitt
had brought out her grandmother's silver candlesticks. babbitt worked
hard. he was good. he told none of the jokes he wanted to tell. he
listened to the others. he started maxwell off with a resounding, "let's
hear about your trip to the yellowstone." he was laudatory, extremely
laudatory. he found opportunities to remark that dr. angus was

as all converts, whether to a religion, love, or gardening, find as by
magic that though hitherto these hobbies have not seemed to exist, now
the whole world is filled with their fury, so, once he was converted
to dissipation, babbitt discovered agreeable opportunities for it
everywhere.

he had a new view of his sporting neighbor, sam doppelbrau. the
doppelbraus were respectable people, industrious people, prosperous
people, whose ideal of happiness was an eternal cabaret. their life was
dominated by suburban bacchanalia of alcohol, nicotine, gasoline, and
kisses. they and their set worked capably all the week, and all week
looked forward to saturday night, when they would, as they expressed
it, "throw a party;" and the thrown party grew noisier and noisier up to
sunday dawn, and usually included an extremely rapid motor expedition to
nowhere in partic

ular.

one evening when tanis was at the theater, babbitt found himself being
lively with the doppelbraus, pledging friendship with men whom he
had for years privily denounced to mrs. babbitt as a "rotten bunch of
tin-horns that i wouldn't go out with, rot if they were the last people
on earth." that evening he had sulkily come home and poked about in
front of the house, chipping off the walk the ice-clots, like fossil
footprints, made by the steps of passers-by during the recent snow.
howard littlefield came up snuffling.

"still a widower, george?"

"yump. cold again to-night."

nine. it was the third time he had entered
the house. by ten he was calling mr. doppelbrau "sam, old hoss."

at eleven they all drove out to the old farm inn. babbitt sat in the
back of doppelbrau's car with louetta swanson. once he had timorously
tried to make love to her. now he did not try; he merely made love; and
louetta dropped her head on his shoulder, told him what a nagger eddie
was, and accepted babbitt as a decent and well-trained libertine.

with the assistance of tanis's bunch, the doppelbraus, and other
companions in forgetfulness, there was not an evening for two weeks when
he did not return home late and shaky. with his other faculties blurred
he yet had the motorist's gift of being able to drive when he could
scarce walk; of slowing down at corners and allowing for approaching
cars. he came wambling into the house. if verona and kenneth escott were
about, he got past them with a hasty greeting, horribly aware of their
level young glances, and hid himself up-stairs. he found when
