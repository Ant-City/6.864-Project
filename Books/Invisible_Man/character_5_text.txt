 the library flashed across the screen of my mind, coming fitfully
and fragmentarily to life -- photographs of men and women in wagons drawn
by mule teams and oxen, dressed in black, dusty clothing, people who seemed
almost without individuality, a black mob that seemed to be waiting, looking
with blank faces, and among them the inevitable collection of white men and
women in smiles, clear of features, striking, elegant and confident. until now,
and although i could recognize the founder and dr. bledsoe among them, the
figures in the photographs had never seemed actually to have been alive, but
were more like signs or symbols one found on the last pages of the
dictionary . . . but now i felt that i was sharing in a great work and, with
the car leaping leisurely beneath the pressure of my foot, i identified myself
with the rich man reminiscing on the rear seat . . .
"a pleasant fate," he repeated, "and i hope yours will be as pleasant."
"yes, sir. thank you, sir," i said, pleased that he wished

hundred-dollar bill!"
when i had turned the car and started back i saw him still standing
in the same place.
suddenly mr. norton touched me on the shoulder. "i must have a
stimulant, young man. a little whiskey."
"yes, sir. are you all right, sir?"
"a little faint, but a stimulant . . ."
his voice trailed off. something cold formed within my chest. if
anything happened to him dr. bledsoe would blame me. i stepped on the
gas, wondering where i could get him some whiskey. not in the town, that
would take too long. there was only one place, the golden day.
"i'll have you some in a few minutes, sir," i said.
"as soon as you can," he said.

railroad tracks and the golden day. at first i failed to recognize them. they

"why, of course."
"then perhaps the young fellow should go downstairs and wait . . ."
the sound of shouting and destruction welled up from below as i
opened the door.
"no, perhaps you should stay," the fat man said. "perhaps had i
overheard some of what i'm about to tell you when i was a student up there
on the hill, i wouldn't be the casualty that i am."
"sit down, young man," mr. norton ordered. "so you were a student
at the college," he said to the vet.
i sat down again, worrying about dr. bledsoe as the fat man told
mr. norton of his attending college, then becoming a physician and going to
france during the world war.
"were you a successful physician?" mr. norton said.
"fairly so. i performed a few brain surgeries that won me some
small attention."
"then why did you return?"
"nostalgia," the vet said.
"then what on earth are you doing here in this . . . ?" mr. norton
said, "with your ability . . ."
"ulcers," the fat man said.
"that's terribly unfortunate, but why should ulcers stop you

s i followed the
white line of the highway. heat rays from the late afternoon sun arose from
the gray concrete, shimmering like the weary tones of a distant bugle blown
upon still midnight air. in the mirror i could see mr. norton staring out
vacantly upon the empty fields, his mouth stern, his white forehead livid
where it had scraped the screen. and seeing him i felt the fear balled coldly
within me unfold. what would happen now? what would the school officials
say? in my mind i visualized dr. bledsoe's face when he saw mr. norton. i
thought of the glee certain folks at home would feel if i were expelled.
tatlock's grinning face danced through my mind. what would the white folks
think who'd sent me to college? was mr. norton angry at me? in the golden
day he had seemed more curious than anything else -- until the vet had
started talking wild. damn trueblood. it was his fault. if we hadn't sat in the
sun so long mr. norton would not have needed whiskey and i wouldn't have

uildings flowed and froze
for a moment in mist, glittering as in winter when rain froze on the grass
and foliage and turned the campus into a world of whiteness, weighting and
bending both trees and bushes with fruit of crystal. then in the twinkling of
my eyes, it was gone, and the here and now of heat and greenness returned.
if only i could make mr. norton understand what the school meant to me.
"shall i stop at your rooms, sir?" i said. "or shall i take you to the
administration building? dr. bledsoe might be worried."
"to my rooms, then bring dr. bledsoe to me," he answered tersely.
"yes, sir."
in the mirror i saw him dabbing gingerly at his forehead with a
crinkled handkerchief. "you'd better send the school physician to me also," he
said.
i stopped the car in front of a small building with white pillars like
those of an old plantation manor house, got out and opened the door.
"mr. norton, please, sir . . . i'm sorry . . . i --"
he looked at me sternly, his eyes narrowed, saying nothing.

 
 ___________________________
 
"i didn't know . . . please . . ."
"send dr. bledsoe to me," he said, turning away and swinging up the
graveled path to the building.
i got back into the car and drove slowly to the administration
building. a girl waved gaily as i passed, a bunch of violets in her hand. two
teachers in dark suits talked decorously beside a broken fountain.
the building was quiet. going upstairs i visualized dr. bledsoe, with
his broad globular face that seemed to take its form from the fat pressing
from the inside, which, as air pressing against the membrane of a balloon,
gave it shape and buoyancy. "old bucket-head," some of the fellows called
him. i never had. he had been kind to me from the first, perhaps because of
the letters which the school superintendent had sent to him when i arrived.
but more than that, he was the example of everything i hoped to be:
influential with wealthy men all over the country

black was white.
"damn what he wants," he said, climbing in the front seat beside me.
"haven't you the sense god gave a dog? we take these white folks where we
want them to go, we show them what we want them to see. don't you know
that? i thought you had some sense."
reaching rabb hall, i stopped the car, weak with bewilderment.
"don't sit there," he said. "come with me!"
just inside the building i got another shock. as we approached a
mirror dr. bledsoe stopped and composed his angry face like a sculptor,
making it a bland mask, leaving only the sparkle of his eyes to betray the
emotion that i had seen only a moment before. he looked steadily at himself
for a moment; then we moved quietly down the silent hall and up the stairs.
a co-ed sat at a graceful table stacked with magazines. before a great
window stood a large aquarium containing colored stones and a small replica
of a feudal castle surrounded by goldfish that seemed to remain motionle

"is mr. norton in his room?" he said to the girl.
"yessir, dr. bledsoe, sir," she said. "he said to tell you to come in
when you got here."
pausing at the door i heard him clear his throat, then rap softly
upon the panel with his fist.
"mr. norton?" he said, his lips already a smile. and at the answer i
followed him inside.
it was a large light room. mr. norton sat in a huge wing chair with
his jacket off. a change of clothing lay on the cool bedspread. above a
spacious fireplace an oil portrait of the founder looked down at me remotely,

seemed to fall.
"i've been worried about you, sir," dr. bledsoe said. "we expected
you at the afternoon session . . ."
now it's beginning, i thought. now --
and suddenly he rushed forward. "mr. norton, your head!" he cried,
a strange grandmotherly concern in his voice. "what happened, sir?"
"it's nothing." mr. norton's face was immobile. "a mere scratch."
dr. bledsoe whirled around, his face outraged. "get the doctor over
here," he said. "why didn't you tell me that mr. norton had been injured?"
"i've already taken care of that, sir," i said softly, seeing him whirl
back.
"mr. norton, mister norton! i'm so sorry," he crooned. "i thought i
had sent you a boy who was careful, a sensible young man! why we've never
had an accident before. never, not in seventy-five years. i assure you, sir,
that he shall be disciplined, severely disciplined!"
"but there was no

my eyes suddenly filled. i felt a wave of gratitude at his words.
"don't be kind, sir," dr. bledsoe said. "you can't be soft with these
people. we mustn't pamper them. an accident to a guest of this college while
he is in the charge of a student is without question the student's fault. that's
one of our strictest rules!" then to me: "return to your dormitory and
remain there until further notice!"
"but it was out of my control, sir," i said, "just as mr. norton said .

been at the table when we went inside.
"i'm sorry," she said. "looks like you have old bucket-head kind of

i lay in my room with my eyes closed, trying to think. the tension
gripped my insides. then i heard someone coming up the hall and stiffened.
had they sent for me already? nearby a door opened and closed, leaving me
as tense as ever. to whom could i turn for help? i could think of no one.
no one to whom i could even explain what had happened at the golden day.
everything was upset inside me. and dr. bledsoe's attitude toward mr.
norton was the most confusing of all. i dared not repeat what he'd said, for
fear that it would lessen my chances of remaining in school. it just wasn't
true, i had misunderstood. he couldn't have said what i thought he had said.
hadn't i seen him approach white visitors too often with his hat in hand,
bowing humbly and respectfully? hadn't he refused to eat in the dining hall
with white guests of the school, entering only after they had finished and

"go to hell," i said.
he left laughing, opening the door to the sound of many footsteps
from the hall: supper time. the sound of departing voices. something of my
life seemed to retreat with them into a gray distance, moiling. then a knock
sounded at the door and i sprang up, my heart tense.
a small student wearing a freshman's cap stuck his head in the door,
shouting, "dr. bledsoe said he wants to see you down at rabb hall." and
then he was gone before i could question him, his footsteps thundering down
the hall as he raced to dinner before the last bell sounded.
at mr. norton's door i stopped with my hand on the knob,
mumbling a prayer.
"come in, young man," he said to my knock. he was dressed in
fresh linen, the light falling upon his white hair as upon silk floss. a small
piece of gauze was plastered to his forehead. he was alone.
"i'm sorry, sir," i apologized, "but

"that's correct," he said, "but dr. bledsoe had to leave. you'll find

behind me. "young man . . ."
i turned hopefully.
"young man, i have explained to dr. bledsoe that you were not at
fault. i believe he understands."
i was so relieved that at first i could only look at him, a small
silken-haired, white-suited st. nicholas, seen through misty eyes.
"i certainly do thank you, sir," i managed finally.
he studied me silently, his eyes slightly narrowed.
"will you need me this evening, sir?" i asked.
"no, i won't be needing the machine. business is taking me away
sooner than i expected. i leave late tonight."
"i could drive you to the station, sir," i said h

"thank you, but dr. bledsoe has already arranged it."
"oh," i said with disappointment. i had hoped that by serving him
the rest of the week i could win back his esteem. now i would not have the
opportunity.
"well, i hope you have a pleasant trip, sir," i said.
"thank you," he said, suddenly smiling.
"and maybe next time you come i'll be able to answer some of the
questions you asked me this afternoon."
"questions?" his eyes narrowed.
"yes, sir, about . . . about your fate," i said.
"ah, yes, yes," he said.

i left somewhat reassured, but not completely. i still had to face dr.
bledsoe. and i had to attend chapel.
chapter 5
at the sound of vespers i moved across the campus with groups of
students, walking slowly, their voices soft in the mellow dusk. i remember the
yellowed globes of frosted glass making lacy silhouettes on the gravel and the
walk of the leaves and branches above us as we moved slow through the
dusk so restless with scents of lilac, honeysuckle and verbena, and the feel of
spring

ee your jordan's water for their
private steam; you, relic of slavery whom the campus loved but did not
understand, aged, of slavery, yet bearer of something warm and vital and
all-enduring, of which in that island of shame we were not ashamed -- it was
to you on the final row i directed my rush of sound, and it was you of
whom i thought with shame and regret as i waited for the ceremony to
begin.
the honored guests moved silently upon the platform, herded toward
their high, carved chairs by dr. bledsoe with the decorum of a portly head
waiter. like some of the guests, he wore striped trousers and a swallow-tail
coat with black-braided lapels topped by a rich ascot tie. it was his regular
dress for such occasions, yet for all its elegance, he managed to make himself
look humble. somehow, his trousers inevitably bagged at the knees and the
coat slouched in the shoulders. i watched him smiling at first one and then
another of the guests, of whom all but one were white; and as i saw him
placing h

s a barber or a nursemaid -- who could touch a white man with
impunity. and i remembered too that whenever white guests came upon the
platform he placed his hand upon them as though exercising a powerful
magic. i watched his teeth flash as he took a white hand; then, with all
seated, he went to his place at the end of the row of chairs.
several terraces of students' faces above them, the organist, his eyes
glinting at the console, was waiting with his head turned over his shoulder,
and i saw dr. bledsoe, his eyes roaming over the audience, suddenly nod
without turning his head. it was as though he had given a downbeat with an
invisible baton. the organist turned and hunched his shoulders. a high
cascade of sound bubbled from the organ, spreading, thick and clinging, over
the chapel, slowly surging. the organist twisted and turned on his bench,
with his feet flying beneath him as though dancing to rhythms totally
unrelated to the decorous thunder of his organ.
and dr. bledsoe sat with a benign

the rows of students, then over the
section reserved for teachers, his swift glance carrying a threat for all. for he
demanded that everyone attend these sessions. it was here that policy was
announced in broadest rhetoric. i seemed to feel his eyes resting upon my
face as he swept the section in which i sat. i looked at the guests on the
platform; they sat with that alert relaxation with which they always met our
upturned eyes. i wondered to which of them i might go to intercede for me
with dr. bledsoe, but within myself i knew that there was no one.
in spite of the array of important men beside him, and despite the
posture of humility and meekness which made him seem smaller than the
others (although he was physically larger), dr. bledsoe made his presence felt
by us with a far greater impact. i remembered the legend of how he had
come to the college, a barefoot boy who in his fervor for education had
trudged with his bundle of ragged clothing across two states. and how he was
given a job fe

spoke. then around me everyone was singing lead me, lead me to a rock
that is higher than i. and as though the sound contained some force more
imperious than the image of the scene of which it was the living connective
tissue, i was pulled back to its immediacy.
one of the guests had risen to speak. a man of striking ugliness; fat,
with a bullet-head set on a short neck, with a nose much too wide for its
face, upon which he wore black-lensed glasses. he had been seated next to
dr. bledsoe, but so concerned had i been with the president that i hadn't
really seen him. my eyes had focused only upon the white men and dr.
bledsoe. so that now as he arose and crossed slowly to the center of the
platform, i had the notion that part of dr. bledsoe had arisen and moved
forward, leaving his other part smiling in the chair.
he stood before us relaxed, his white collar gleaming like a band
between his black face and his dark garments, dividing his head from his
body; his short arms crossed

before his barrel, like a black little buddha's.
for a moment he stood with his large head lifted, as though thinking; then
he began speaking, his voice round and vibrant as he told of his pleasure in
being allowed to visit the school once more after many years. having been
preaching in a northern city, he had seen it last in the final days of the
founder, when dr. bledsoe was the "second in command." "those were
wonderful days," he droned. "significant days. days filled with great portent."
as he talked he made a cage of his hands by touching his fingertips,
then with his small feet pressing together, he began a slow, rhythmic rocking;
tilting forward on his toes until it seemed he would fall, then back on his
heels, the lights catching his black-lensed glasses until it seemed that his head
floated free of his body and was held close to it only by the white band

ract of tears, his features rigid as though he
struggled within himself. the fat man was playing upon the whole audience
without the least show of exertion. he seemed completely composed, hidden
behind his black-lensed glasses, only his mobile features gesturing his vocal
drama. i nudged the boy beside me.
"who is he?" i whispered.
he gave me a look of annoyance, almost of outrage. "reverend
homer a. barbee, chicago," he said.
now the speaker rested his arm upon the lectern and turned toward
dr. bledsoe:
"you've heard the bright beginning of the beautiful story, my friends.
but there is the mournful ending, and perhaps in many ways the richer side.
the setting of this glorious son of the morning."
he turned to dr. bledsoe, "it was a fateful day, dr. bledsoe, sir, if i
may recall it to you, for we were there. oh yes, my young friends," he said,
turning to face us again with a sad proud smile. "i knew him well and loved
him, and i was there.
"we had toured through several states to which he was

"and the founder pauses, then steps forward with his eyes spilling
his great emotion. with his arm upraised, he begins to answer and totters.
then all is commotion. we rush forward and lead him away.
"the audience leaps to its feet in consternation. all is terror and
turmoil, a moan and a sighing. until, like a clap of thunder, i hear dr.
bledsoe's voice ring out whip-like with authority, a song of hope. and as we
stretch the founder upon a bench to rest, i hear dr. bledsoe stomping out
the time with mighty strokes upon the hollow platform, commanding not in
words but in the great gut-tones of his magnificent basso -- oh, but wasn't he
a singer? isn't he a singer still today? -- and they stand, they calm, and with
him they sing out against the tottering of their giant. sing out their long
black songs of blood and bones:
"meaning hope!
"of hardship and pain:
"meaning faith!
"of humbleness and absurdity:
"meaning endurance!

"it was as though the very constellations knew our impending
sorrow," he bugled, his head raised to the ceiling, his voice full-throated. "for
against that great -- wide -- sweep of sable there came the burst of a single
jewel-like star, and i saw it shimmer, and break, and streak down the cheek
of that coal-black sky like a reluctant and solitary tear . . ."
he shook his head with great emotion, his lips pursed as he moaned,
"mmmmmmmmmm," turning toward dr. bledsoe as though he did not quite
see him. "at that fateful moment . . . mmmmmm, i sat with your great
president . . . mmmmmmmmmm! he was deep in meditation as we awaited
word from the men of science, and he said to me of that dying star,
" 'barbee, friend, did you see?'
"and i answered, 'yes, doctor, i saw.'

moved closer, until he stood beside the berth, and the light slanting across
his shoulder as he knelt beside him. and the hand reached out and gently
touched him and he said, 'now, you must take on the burden. lead them the
rest of the way.' and oh, the cry of that train and the pain too big for tears!
"when the train reached the summit of the mountain, he was no
longer with us. and as the train dropped down the grade he had departed.
"it had become a veritable train of sorrow. dr. bledsoe there, sat

onto the back of his fiery and half-broken charger. ah! and that great, black,

sense of loss. what command should he give? should he return with his

when the sad news spread, a day of mourning was declared for the whole
municipality. oh, and how rich and poor, black and white, weak and
powerful, young and old, all came to pay their homage-many realizing the
leader's worth and their loss only now with his passing. and how, with his
mission done, dr. bledsoe returned, keeping his sorrowful vigil with his friend
in an humble baggage car; and how the people came to pay their respects at
the stations . . . a slow train. a sorrowful train. and all along the line, in
mountain and valley, wherever the rails found their fateful course, the people
were one in their common mourning, and like the cold steel rails, were
spiked down to their sorrow. oh, what a sad departure!
"and what an even sadder arrival. see with me, my young friends,

as barbee paused the silence was so complete that i could hear the
power engines far across the campus throbbing the night like an excited
pulse. somewhere in the audience an old woman's voice began a plaintive
wail; the birth of a sad, untormulated song that died stillborn in a sob.
barbee stood with his head thrown back, his arms rigid at his sides,
his fists clenched as though fighting desperately for control. dr. bledsoe sat
with his face in his hands. near me someone blew his nose. barbee took a
tottering step forward.
"oh, yes. oh, yes," he said. "oh, yes. that too is part of the glorious
story. but think of it not as a death, but as a birth. a great seed had been
planted. a seed which has continued to put forth its fruit in its season as

than ever. for a few minutes old barbee had made me see the vision and
now i knew that leaving the campus would be like the parting of flesh. i
watched him lower his arms now and start back to his chair, moving slowly
with his head cocked as though listening to distant music. i had lowered my
head to wipe my eyes when i heard the shocked gasp arise.
looking up, i saw two of the white trustees moving swiftly across the
platform to where barbee floundered upon dr. bledsoe's legs. the old man
slid forward upon his hands and knees as the two white men took his arms;
and now as he stood i saw one of them reach for something on the floor
and place it in his hands. it was when he raised his head that i saw it. for
a swift instant, between the gesture and the opaque glitter of his glasses, i
saw the blinking of sightless eyes. homer a. barbee was blind.
uttering apologies, dr. bledsoe helped him to his chair. then as the
old man rested back with a smile, dr. bledsoe w

platform and lifted his arms. i closed my eyes as i heard the deep moaning
sound that issued from him, and the rising crescendo of the student body
joining in. this time it was music sincerely felt, not rendered for the guests,
but for themselves; a song of hope and exaltation. i wanted to rush from the
building, but didn't dare. i sat stiff and erect, supported by the hard bench,
relying upon it as upon a form of hope.
i could not look at dr. bledsoe now, because old barbee had made
me both feel my guilt and accept it. for although i had not intended it, any
act that endangered the continuity of the dream was an act of treason.
i did not listen to the next speaker, a tall white man who kept
dabbing at his eyes with a handkerchief and repeating his phrases in an
emotional and inarticulate manner. then the orchestra played excerpts from
dvorak's new world symphony and i kept hearing "swing low sweet
chariot" resounding through its dominant th

i might well have waited until the end of the services, for i hadn't
gone far when i heard the dim, bright notes of the orchestra striking up a
march, followed by a burst of voices as the students filed out into the night.
with a feeling of dread i headed for the administration building, and upon
reaching it, stood in the darkened doorway. my mind fluttered like the moths
that veiled the street lamp which cast shadows upon the bank of grass below
me. i would now have my real interview with dr. bledsoe, and i recalled
barbee's address with resentment. with such words fresh in his mind, i was
sure dr. bledsoe would be far less sympathetic to my plea. i stood in that
darkened doorway trying to probe my future if i were expelled. where would
i go, what would i do? how could i ever return home?

om time to time she tapped hollowly upon the walk like a blind
man. snatches of their conversation fluttered to me as they discussed barbee's
talk with enthusiasm, recalled the times of the founder, their quavering voices
weaving and embroidering his story. then down the long avenue of trees i
saw the familiar cadillac approaching and started inside the building,
suddenly filled with panic. i hadn't gone two steps before i turned and
hurried out into the night again. i couldn't stand to face dr. bledsoe
immediately. i was fairly shivering as i fell in behind a group of boys going
up the drive. they were arguing some point heatedly, but i was too agitated
to listen and simply followed in their shadows, noticing the dull gleam of
their polished shoe-leather in the rays of the street lamps. i kept trying to
formulate what i would say to dr. bledsoe, and the boys must have turned
into their building, for suddenly finding myself outside the gates of the
campus and heading down the highway, i turned

"i wouldn't lie, sir," i said.
"then who was that patient you were talking with?"
"i never saw him before, sir."
"what was he saying?"
"i can't recall it all," i muttered. "the man was raving."
"speak up. what did he say?"
"he thinks that he lived in france and that he's a great doctor . . ."
"continue."
"he said that i believed that white was right," i said.
"what?" suddenly his face twitched and cracked like the surface of
dark water. "and you do, don't you?" dr. bledsoe said, suppressing a nasty
laugh. "well, don't you?"
i did not answer, thinking, you, you . . .
"who was he, did you ever see him before?"

the case a portrait of the founder looked noncommittally down.
"hee, hee!" bledsoe laughed. "your arms are too short to box with
me, son. and i haven't had to really clip a young negro in years. no," he
said getting up, "they haven't been so cocky as they used to."
this time i could barely move, my stomach was knotted and my
kidneys ached. my legs were rubbery. for three years i had thought of myself
as a man and here with a few words he'd made me as helpless as an infant.
i pulled myself up . . .

was night with no one to witness my condition. my stomach felt raw. from
somewhere across the quiet of the campus the sound of an old guitar-blues
plucked from an out-of-tune piano drifted toward me like a lazy, shimmering
wave, like the echoed whistle of a lonely train, and my head went over again,
against a tree this time, and i could hear it splattering the flowering vines.
when i could move, my head started to whirl in a circle. the day's
events flowed past. trueblood, mr. norton, dr. bledsoe and the golden day
swept around my mind in a mad surreal whirl. i stood in the path holding
my eye and trying to push back the day, but each time i floundered upon
dr. bledsoe's decision. it still echoed in my mind and it was real and it was
final. whatever my responsibility was for what had occurred, i knew that i
would pay for it, knew that i would be expelled, and the very idea stabbed
my insides again. i stood there on the moonlit walk, trying to think ahead to
its effects, imagining the sa

ccess available to such as me. i was so completely a part of that existence
that in the end i had to make my peace. it was either that or admit that my
grandfather had made sense. which was impossible, for though i still believed
myself innocent, i saw that the only alternative to permanently facing the
world of trueblood and the golden day was to accept the responsibility for
what had happened. somehow, i convinced myself, i had violated the code
and thus would have to submit to punishment. dr. bledsoe is right, i told
myself, he's right; the school and what it stands for have to be protected.
there was no other way, and no matter how much i suffered i would pay my
debt as quickly as possible and return to building my career . . .
back in my room i counted my savings, some fifty dollars, and
decided to get to new york as quickly as possible. if dr. bledsoe didn't
change his mind about helping me get a job, it would be enough to pay my
room and board at men's house, about which i had learned f

so while my roommate grinned and mumbled unaware in his sleep i
packed my bags.
next morning i was up before the bugle sounded and already on a
bench in dr. bledsoe's outer office when he appeared. the jacket of his blue
serge suit was open, revealing a heavy gold chain linked between his vest
pockets as he moved toward me with a noiseless tread. he passed without
seeming to see me. then as he reached his office door he said, "i haven't
changed my mind about you, boy. and i don't intend to!"
"oh, i didn't come for that, sir," i said, seeing him turn quickly,
looking down upon me, his eyes quizzical.
"very well, as long as you understand that. come in and s

connected with trueblood or the golden day.
crenshaw, a much smaller man than supercargo, said nothing. he
was not the type usually sent out to accompany violent cases and i was glad
until i remembered that the only violent thing about the vet was his tongue.
his mouth had already gotten me into trouble and now i hoped he wouldn't
turn it upon the white driver -- that was apt to get us killed. what was he
doing on the bus anyway? god, how had dr. bledsoe worked that fast? i
stared at the fat man.
"how did your friend mr. norton make out?" he asked.
"he's okay," i said.
"no more fainting spells?"
"no."
"did he bawl you out for what happened?"
"he didn't blame me," i said.
"good. i think i shocked him more than anything else he saw at the
golden day. i hoped i hadn't caused you trouble. school isn't out so soon, is
it?"
"not quite," i said lightly. "i'm leaving early in order to take a job."

waiting to get on, a short, comical figure turning to wave, then disappearing
through the door of the red brick terminal. i sat back with a sigh of relief,
yet once the passengers were aboard and the bus under way again, i felt sad
and utterly alone.
not until we were sailing through the jersey countryside did my
spirits begin to rise. then my old confidence and optimism revived, and i
tried to plan my time in the north. i would work hard and serve my
employer so well that he would shower dr. bledsoe with favorable reports.
and i would save my money and return in the fall full of new york culture.
i'd be indisputably the leading campus figure. perhaps i would attend town
meeting, which i had heard over the radio. i'd learn the platform tricks of
the leading speakers. and i would make the best of my contacts. when i met
the big men to whom my letters were addressed i would put on my best
manner. i would speak softly, in my most polished tones, smile agreeably and
be most polite; and i would

put the bible aside. this was new york. i had to get a job and earn money.
i took off my coat and hat and took my packet of letters and lay
back upon the bed, drawing a feeling of importance from reading the
important names. what was inside, and how could i open them undetected?
they were tightly sealed. i had read that letters were sometimes steamed
open, but i had no steam. i gave it up, i really didn't need to know their
contents and it would not be honorable or safe to tamper with dr. bledsoe. i
knew already that they concerned me and were addressed to some of the
most important men in the whole country. that was enough. i caught myself
wishing for someone to show the letters to, someone who could give me a
proper reflection of my importance. finally, i went to the mirror and gave
myself an admiring smile as i spread the letters upon the dresser like a hand
of high trump cards.
then i began to map my campaign for the next day. first, i would

appointment with one of them, you couldn't bring them any slow c.p. (colored
people's) time. yes, and i would have to get a watch. i would do everything
to schedule. i recalled the heavy gold chain that hung between dr. bledsoe's
vest pockets and the air with which he snapped his watch open to consult
the time, his lips pursed, chin pulled in so that it multiplied, his forehead
wrinkled. then he'd clear his throat and give a deeply intoned order, as
though each syllable were pregnant with nuances of profoundly important
meaning. i recalled my expulsion, feeling quick anger and attempting to
suppress it immediately; but now i was not quite successful, my resentment
stuck out at the edges, making me uncomfortable. maybe

the white folks wouldn't like it, and the negroes would say that you were
"putting on." but here in the north i would slough off my southern ways of
speech. indeed, i would have one way of speaking in the north and another
in the south. give them what they wanted down south, that was the way. if
dr. bledsoe could do it, so could i. before going to bed that night i wiped
off my brief case with a clean towel and placed the letters carefully inside.
the next morning i took an early subway into the wall street
district, selecting an address that carried me almost to the end of the island.
it was dark with the tallness of the buildings and the narrow streets.
armored cars with alert guards went past as i looked for the number. the
streets were full of hurrying people who walked as though they had been

warning me against the ways of the wicked city. now i couldn't write them
for money without revealing that i had been lying about the job.
finally i tried to reach the important men by telephone, only to
receive polite refusals by their secretaries. but fortunately i still had the letter
to mr. emerson. i decided to use it, but instead of handing it over to a
secretary, i wrote a letter explaining that i had a message from dr. bledsoe
and requesting an appointment. maybe i've been wrong about the secretaries,
i thought; maybe they destroyed the letters. i should have been more careful.
i thought of mr. norton. if only the last letter had been addressed to
him. if only he lived in new york so that i could make a personal appeal!
somehow i felt closer to mr. norton, and felt that if he should see me, he
would remember that it was i whom he connected so closely to his fate. now
it seemed ages ago and in a different season and a

with the out-numbered settlers winning each engagement; an epic of wagon

me taking part in the adventures) and left the dark room in a lighter mood.
but that night i dreamed of my grandfather and awoke depressed. i walked
out of the building with a queer feeling that i was playing a part in some
scheme which i did not understand. somehow i felt that bledsoe and norton
were behind it, and all day i was inhibited in both speech and conduct, for
fear that i might say or do something scandalous. but this was all fantastic, i
told myself. i was being too impatient. i could wait for the trustees to make
a move. perhaps i was being subjected to a test of some kind. they hadn't
told me the rules, i knew, but the feeling persisted. perhaps my exile would
end suddenly and i would be given a scholarship to return to the campus.

if you wished to play a leading role. it made the folks talk about you, try to
figure you out. i had to be careful though, not to speak too much like a
northern negro; they wouldn't like that. the thing to do, i thought with a
smile, was to give them hints that whatever you did or said was weighted
with broad and mysterious meanings that lay just beneath the surface. they'd
love that. and the vaguer you told things, the better. you had to keep them
guessing -- just as they guessed about dr. bledsoe: did dr. bledsoe stop at
an expensive white hotel when he visited new york? did he go on parties
with the trustees? and how did he act?
"man, i bet he has him a fine time. they tell me when ole doc gets
to new york he don't stop for the red lights. say he drinks his good red
whiskey and smokes his good black cigars and forgets all about you ole
know-nothing-negroes down here on the campus. say when he gets up north
he makes everybody call him mister doctor bledsoe."
i smiled as the conversation

 came back to my mind. i felt good.
perhaps it was all to the best that i had been sent away. i had learned more.
heretofore all the campus gossip had seemed merely malicious and
disrespectful; now i could see the advantage for dr. bledsoe. whether we
liked him or not, he was never out of our minds. that was a secret of
leadership. strange i should think of it now, for although i'd never given it
any thought before, i seemed to have known it all along. only here the
distance from the campus seemed to make it clear and hard, and i thought it
without fear. here it came to hand just as easily as the coin which i now
placed on the counter for my breakfast. it was fifteen cents and as i felt for

his whole manner had changed.
"but you said . . ." i stood up, completely confused. was he having
fun with me? "couldn't you let me talk to him for just five minutes?" i
pleaded. "i'm sure i can convince him that i'm worthy of a job. and if
there's someone who has tampered with my letter, i'll prove my identity . . .

"identity! my god! who has any identity any more anyway? it isn't
so perfectly simple. look," he said with an anguished gesture. "will you trust
me?"
"why, yes, sir, i trust you."
he leaned forward. "look," he said, his face working violently, "i was

you read the letter, but still you refuse to let me see him, and now you're

have you got against me? you, a northern white man!"
he looked pained. "i've done it badly," he said, "but you must
believe that i am trying to advise you what is best for you." he snatched off
his glasses.
"but i know what's best for me," i said. "or at least dr. bledsoe
does, and if i can't see mr. emerson today, just tell me when i can and i'll
be here . . ."
he bit his lips and shut his eyes, shaking his head from side to side
as though fighting back a scream. "i'm sorry, really sorry that i started all of
this," he said, suddenly calm. "it was foolish of me to try to advise you, but
please, you mustn't believe that i'm against you . . . or your race. i'm your

"my father, yes, though i would have preferred it otherwise. but he

incapable of such cynicism. it would do you no good."
"but i'd like to take my chances, mr. emerson, sir . . . this is very
important to me. my whole career depends upon it."
"but you have no chance," he said.
"but dr. bledsoe sent me here," i said, growing more excited. "i
must have a chance . . ."
"dr. bledsoe," he said with distaste. "he's like my . . . he ought to
be horsewhipped! here," he said, sweeping up the letter and thrusting it
crackling toward me. i took it, looking into his eyes that burned back at me.
"go on, read it," he cried excitedly. "go on!"
"but i wasn't asking for this," i said.
"read it!"

i raised my head. twenty-five years seemed to have lapsed between
his handing me the letter and my grasping its message. i could not believe it,
tried to read it again. i could not believe it, yet i had a feeling that it all

fluids had suddenly dried.

seemed far away. i stopped before a gray wall where high above me the
headstones of a church graveyard arose like the tops of buildings. across the
street in the shade of an awning a shoeshine boy was dancing for pennies. i
went on to the corner and got on a bus and went automatically to the rear.
in the seat in front of me a dark man in a panama hat kept whistling a tune
between his teeth. my mind, flew in circles, to bledsoe, emerson and back
again. there was no sense to be made of it. it was a joke. hell, it couldn't
be a joke. yes, it is a joke . . . suddenly the bus jerked to a stop and i
heard myself humming the same tune that the man ahead was whistling, and
the words came back:

cret plan. what was young emerson's plan -- and why should it have
included me? who was i anyway? i tossed fitfully. perhaps it was a test of
my good will and faith -- but that's a lie, i thought. it's a lie and you know
it's a lie. i had seen the letter and it had practically ordered me killed. by
slow degrees . . .
"my dear mr. emerson," i said aloud. "the robin bearing this letter
is a former student. please hope him to death, and keep him running. your
most humble and obedient servant, a. h. bledsoe . . ."
sure, that's the way it was, i thought, a short, concise verbal coup de
grace, straight to the nape of the neck. and emerson would write in reply?
sure: "dear bled, have met robin and shaved tail. signed, emerson."
i sat on the bed and laughed. they'd sent me to the rookery, all
right. i laughed and felt numb and weak, knowing that soon the pain would
come and that no matter what happened to me i'd never be the same. i felt
numb and i was laughing. when i stopped, gasping for breath, i d

with decision. i had to have a job and i took what i hoped was the quickest
means. i called the plant young emerson had mentioned, and it worked. i
was told to report the following morning. it happened so quickly and with
such ease that for a moment i felt turned around. had they planned it this
way? but no, they wouldn't catch me again. this time i had made the

long as he's satisfied . . .
but i had a feeling that something had gone wrong, something far
more important than the paint; that either i had played a trick on kimbro or
he, like the trustees and bledsoe, was playing one on me . . .
when the truck backed up to the platform i was pressing the cover
on the last bucket -- and there stood kimbro above me.
"let's see your samples," he said.
i reached, trying to select the whitest, as the blue-shirted truckmen
climbed through the loading door.

i could feel their eyes, saw them all and saw too the time when they
would know that my prospects were ended and saw already the contempt
they'd feel for me, a college man who had lost his prospects and pride. i
could see it all and i knew that even the officials and the older men would
despise me as though, somehow, in losing my place in bledsoe's world i had
betrayed them . . . i saw it as they looked at my overalls.
i had started toward the elevator when i heard the voice raised in
laughter and turned to see him holding forth to a group in the lobby chairs
and the rolls of fat behind the wrinkled, high-domed, close-cut head, and i

full and foul, and moved forward two long steps, dumping its great brown,

prominent baptist, who shot up wide-eyed with disbelief and outrage, and i
shot around and out of the lobby before anyone could think to stop me.

action. later it began to rain and i sneaked back near men's house and
persuaded an amused porter to slip my things out to me. i learned that i

load of the emotion-freezing ice which my life had conditioned my brain to
produce, a spot of black anger glowed and threw off a hot red light of such
intensity that had lord kelvin known of its existence, he would have had to
revise his measurements. a remote explosion had occurred somewhere,
perhaps back at emerson's or that night in bledsoe's office, and it had caused
the ice cap to melt and shift the slightest bit. but that bit, that fraction, was
irrevocable. coming to new york had perhaps been an unconscious attempt to
keep the old freezing unit going, but it hadn't worked; hot water had gotten
into its coils. only a drop, perhaps, but that drop was the first wave of the

faces with the peel. what a group of people we were, i thought. why, you
could cause us the greatest humiliation simply by confronting us with
something we liked. not all of us, but so many. simply by walking up and
shaking a set of chitterlings or a well-boiled hog maw at them during the
clear light of day! what consternation it would cause! and i saw myself
advancing upon bledsoe, standing bare of his false humility in the crowded
lobby of men's house, and seeing him there and him seeing me and ignoring
me and me enraged and suddenly whipping out a foot or two of chitterlings,
raw, uncleaned and dripping sticky circles on the floor as i shake them in his
face, shouting:
"bledsoe, you're a shameless chitterling eater! i accuse you of
relishing how bowels! ha! and not only do you eat them, you sneak and eat

greens, and racks of pigs' ears, and pork chops and black-eyed peas with dull
accusing eyes.
i let out a wild laugh, almost choking over the yam as the scene
spun before me. why, with others present, it would be worse than if i had
accused him of raping an old woman of ninety-nine years, weighing ninety

apart; less an exile from down home, the south? . . . but all this is negative.
to become less -- in order to become more? perhaps that was it, but in what
way more human? even woodridge hadn't spoken of such things. it was a
mystery once more, as at the eviction i had uttered words that had possessed
me.
i thought of bledsoe and norton and what they had done. by kicking
me into the dark they'd made me see the possibility of achieving something
greater and more important than i'd ever dreamed. here was a way that
didn't lead through the back door, a way not limited by black and white, but
a way which, if one lived long enough and worked hard enough, could lead

was going out of its way to make my name prominent. articles, telegrams
and many mailings went out over my signature -- some of which i'd written,
but most not. i was publicized, identified with the organization both by word
and image in the press. on the way to work one late spring morning i
counted fifty greetings from people i didn't know, becoming aware that there
were two of me: the old self that slept a few hours a night and dreamed
sometimes of my grandfather and bledsoe and brockway and mary, the self
that flew without wings and plunged from great heights; and the new public
self that spoke for the brotherhood and was becoming so much more
important than the other that i seemed to run a foot race against myself.
still, i liked my work during those days of certainty. i kept my eyes
wide and ears alert. the brotherhood was a world within a world and i was
determined to discover all its secrets and to advance as far as i could. i saw

no, you could never tell where you were going, that was a sure

when you arrived it was somehow right. for hadn't i started out with a
speech, and hadn't it been a speech that won my scholarship to college,
where i had expected speechmaking to win me a place with bledsoe and
launch me finally as a national leader? well, i had made a speech, and it
had made me a leader, only not the kind i had expected. so that was the
way it was. and no complaints, i thought, looking at the map; you started
looking for red men and you found them -- even though of a different tribe
and in a bright new world. the world was strange if you stopped to think
about it; still it was a world that could be controlled by science, and the

i saw him place his hand on the desk. "brother," he said, calling me
"brother" for the first time, "i want you to take it. i guess it's a kind of luck
piece. anyway, it's the one i filed to get away."
i took it in my hand, a thick, dark, oily piece of filed steel that had
been twisted open and forced partly back into place, on which i saw marks
that might have been made by the blade of a hatchet. it was such a link as i
had seen on bledsoe's desk, only while that one had been smooth, tarp's
bore the marks of haste and violence, looking as though it had been attacked
and conquered before it stubbornly yielded.
i looked at him and shook my head as he watched me inscrutably.
finding no words to ask him more about it, i slipped the link over my
knuckles and struck it sharply against the desk.
brother tarp chuckled. "now there's a way i never thought of using
it," he said. "it's pretty good. it's pretty good."
"but why do you give it

rly confident. perhaps from the shock of seeming to see my
grandfather looking through tarp's eyes, perhaps through the calmness of his
voice alone, or perhaps through his story and his link of chain, he had
restored my perspective.
he's right, i thought; whoever sent the message is trying to confuse
me; some enemy is trying to halt our progress by destroying my faith through
touching upon my old southern distrust, our fear of white betrayal. it was as
though he had learned of my experience with bledsoe's letters and was trying
to use that knowledge to destroy not only me but the whole brotherhood. yet
that was impossible; no one knew that story who knew me now. it was
simply an obscene coincidence. if only i could get my hands upon his stupid
throat. here in the brotherhood was the one place in the country where we
were free and given the greatest encouragement to use our abilities, and he
was trying to destroy it! no, it wasn't me he was worrying about becoming
too big, it was the brotherhoo

ght of jack, the people at the funeral,
rinehart. they'd asked us for bread and the best i could give was a glass eye
-- not so much as an electric guitar.
i stopped and dropped to a bench. i should leave, i thought. that
would be the honest thing to do. otherwise i could only tell them to have
hope and try to hold on to those who'd listen. was that also what rinehart
was, a principle of hope for which they gladly paid? otherwise there was
nothing but betrayal, and that meant going back to serve bledsoe, and
emerson, jumping from the pot of absurdity to the fire of the ridiculous. and
either was a self-betrayal. but i couldn't leave; i had to settle with jack and
tobitt. i owed it to clifton and tarp and the others. i had to hold on ... and
then i had an idea that shook me profoundly: you don't have to worry about
the people. if they tolerate rinehart, then they will forget it and even with
them you are invisible. it lasted only the fraction of a second and i rejected
it immediately; still it

not only could you travel upward toward success but you could travel
downward as well; up and down, in retreat as well as in advance, crabways
and crossways and around in a circle, meeting your old selves coming and
going and perhaps all at the same time. how could i have missed it for so
long? hadn't i grown up around gambler-politicians, bootlegger-judges and
sheriffs who were burglars; yes, and klansmen who were preachers and
members of humanitarian societies? hell, and hadn't bledsoe tried to tell me
what it was all about? i felt more dead than alive. it had been quite a day;
one that could not have been more shattering even if i had learned that the
man whom i'd always called father was actually of no relation to me.
i went to the apartment and fell across the bed in my clothes. it was
hot and the fan did little more than stir the heat in heavy leaden waves,
beneath which i lay twirling the dark glasses and watching the hypnotic
flickering of the lenses as i tried to make

 of whom i was now, just now, a leader, though leading
them, running ahead of them, only in the stripping away of my illusionment.
i looked at ras on his horse and at their handful of guns and
recognized the absurdity of the whole night and of the simple yet
confoundingly complex arrangement of hope and desire, fear and hate, that
had brought me here still running, and knowing now who i was and where i
was and knowing too that i had no longer to run for or from the jacks and
the emersons and the bledsoes and nortons, but only from their confusion,
impatience, and refusal to recognize the beautiful absurdity of their american
identity and mine. i stood there, knowing that by dying, that by being hanged
by ras on this street in this destructive night i would perhaps move them
one fraction of a bloody step closer to a definition of who they were and of
what i was and had been. but the definition would have been too narrow; i
was invisible, and hanging would not bring me to visibility, even to the

eyes, since they wanted my death not for myself alone but for the chase i'd
been on all my life; because of the way i'd run, been run, chased, operated,
purged -- although to a great extent i could have done nothing else, given
their blindness (didn't they tolerate both rinehart and bledsoe?) and my
invisibility. and that i, a little black man with an assumed name should die
because a big black man in his hatred and confusion over the nature of a
reality that seemed controlled solely by white men whom i knew to be as
blind as he, was just too much, too outrageously absurd. and i knew that it
was better to live out one's own absurdity than to die for that of others,
whether for ras's or jack's.
so when ras yelled, "hang him!" i let fly the spear and it was as

you've run enough, you're through with them at last," and i collapsed, face
forward and lay there beyond the point of exhaustion, too tired to close my
eyes. it was a state neither of dreaming nor of waking, but somewhere in
between, in which i was caught like trueblood's jaybird that yellow jackets
had paralyzed in every part but his eyes.
but somehow the floor had now turned to sand and the darkness to
light, and i lay the prisoner of a group consisting of jack and old emerson
and bledsoe and norton and ras and the school superintendent and a
number of others whom i failed to recognize, but all of whom had run me,
who now pressed around me as i lay beside a river of black water, near
where an armored bridge arched sharply away to where i could not see. and
i was protesting their holding me and they were demanding that i return to
them and were annoyed with my refusal.
"no," i said. "i'm through with all your illusions and lies, i'm
through running."

 air. "how does it feel to be free of one's illusions?"
and i looked up through a pain so intense now that the air seemed
to roar with the clanging of metal, hearing, how does it feel to be
free of illusion . . .
and now i answered, "painful and empty," as i saw a glittering
butterfly circle three times around my blood-red parts, up there beneath the
bridge's high arch. "but look," i said pointing. and they looked and laughed,
and suddenly seeing their satisfied faces and understanding, i gave a bledsoe
laugh, startling them. and jack came forward, curious.
"why do you laugh?" he said.
"because at a price i now see that which i couldn't see," i said.
"what does he think he sees?" they said.
and jack came closer, threatening, and i laughed. "i'm not afraid
now," i said. "but if you'll look, you'll see . . . it's not invisible . . ."
"see what?" they said.
"that there hang not only my generations wasting upon the water --"
and now the pain welled up and i could no longer see them.
"but what? go
