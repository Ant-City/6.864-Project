now after gandalf had ridden for some time the light of day grew in the sky, and pippin roused himself and looked up. to his left lay a sea of mist, rising to a bleak shadow in the east; but to his right great mountains reared their heads, ranging from the west to a steep and sudden end, as if in the making of the land the river had burst through a great barrier, carving o

â€˜faramir! faramir!â€™ men cried, weeping in the streets. but he did not answer, and they bore him away up the winding road to the citadel and his father. even as the nazgÃ»l had swerved aside from the onset of the white rider, there came flying a deadly dart, and faramir, as he held at bay a mounted champion of harad, had fallen to the earth. only the charge of dol amroth had saved him from the red southland swords that would have hewed him as he lay.
the prince imrahil brought faramir to the white tower, and he said: your son has returned, lord, after great deeds, and he told all that he had seen. but denethor rose and looked on the face of his son and was silent. then he bade them make a bed in the chamber and lay faramir upon it and depart. but he himself went up alone into the secret room under the summit of the tower; and many who looked up thither at that time saw a pale light that gleamed and flickered from the narrow windows for a while, and then flash

â€˜what burden do you bear, men of rohan?â€™ he cried.
â€˜thÃ©oden king,â€™ they answered. â€˜he is dead. but Ã©omer king now rides in the battle: he with the white crest in the wind.â€™
then the prince went from his horse, and knelt by the bier in honour of the king and his great onset; and he wept. and rising he looked then on Ã©owyn and was amazed. â€˜surely, here is a woman?â€™ he said. â€˜have even the women of the rohirrim come to

nor; and the din of arms rose upon high, with the crying of men and the neighing of horses. horns were blown and trumpets were braying, and the mÃ»makil were bellowing as they were goaded to war. under the south walls of the city the footmen of gondor now drove against the legions of morgul that were still gathered there in strength. but the horsemen rode eastward to the succour of Ã©omer: hÃºrin the tall warden of the keys, and the lord of lossarnach, and hirluin of the green hills, and prince imrahil the fair with his knights all about him.
not too soon came their aid to the rohirrim; for fortune had turned against Ã©omer, and his fury had betrayed him. the great wrath of his onset had utterly overthrown the front of his enemies, and great wedges of his riders had passed clear through the ranks of the southrons, discomfiting their horsemen and riding their footmen to ruin. but wherever the mÃ»makil came there the horses would not go, but blenched and swerved away; and the great monsters wer

 were dyed as with blood; fire glowed in the river, and the grass of the pelennor lay red in the nightfall. and in that hour the great battle of the field of gondor was over; and not one living foe was left within the circuit of the rammas. all were slain save those who fled to die, or to drown in the red foam of the river. few ever came eastward to morgul or mordor; and to the land of the haradrim came only a tale from far off: a rumour of the wrath and terror of gondor.
aragorn and Ã©omer and imrahil rode back towards the gate of the city, and they were now weary beyond joy or sorrow. these three were unscathed, for such was their fortune and the skill and might of their arms, and few indeed had dared to abide them or look on their faces in the hour of their wrath. but many others were hurt or maimed or dead upon the field. the axes hewed forlong as he fought alone and unhorsed; and both duilin of morthond and his brother were trampled to death when they assailed the mÃ»makil, leading their

then having made up his mind he acted swiftly; and catching up pippin and setting him before him, he turned shadowfax with a word. up the climbing streets of minas tirith they clattered, while the noise of war rose behind them. everywhere men were rising from their despair and dread, seizing their weapons, crying one to another: â€˜rohan has come!â€™ captains were shouting, companies were mustering; many already were marching down to the gate.
they met the prince imrahil, and he called to them: â€˜whither now, mithrandir? the rohirrim are fighting on the fields of gondor! we must gather all the strength that we can find.â€™
â€˜you will need every man and more,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜make all haste. i will come when i can. but i have an errand to the lord denethor that will not wait. take command in the lordâ€™s absence!â€™
they passed on; and as they climbed and drew near to the citadel they felt the wind blowing in their faces, and they caught the glimmer of morn

â€˜i have been too busy with this and that to heed all the crying and shouting,â€™ she answered. â€˜all i hope is that those murdering devils do not come to this house and trouble the sick.â€™
then gandalf went out in haste, and already the fire in the sky was burning out, and the smouldering hills were fading, while ash-grey evening crept over the fields.
now as the sun went down aragorn and Ã©omer and imrahil drew near the city with their captains and knights; and when they came before the gate aragorn said:
â€˜behold the sun setting in a great fire! it is a sign of the end and fall of many things, and a change in the tides of the world. but this city and realm has rested in the charge of the stewards for many long years, and i fear that if i enter it unbidden, then doubt and debate may arise, which should not be while this war is fought. i will not enter in, nor make any claim, until it be seen whe

but Ã©omer said: â€˜already you have raised the banner of the kings and displayed the tokens of elendilâ€™s house. will you suffer these to be challenged?â€™
â€˜no,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜but i deem the time unripe; and i have no mind for strife except with our enemy and his servants.â€™
and the prince imrahil said. your words, lord, are wise, if one who is a kinsman of the lord denethor may counsel you in this matter. he is strong-willed and proud, but old; and his mood has been strange since his son was stricken down. yet i would not have you remain like a beggar at the door.â€™
â€˜not a beggar,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜say a captain of the rangers, who are unused to cities and houses of stone.â€™ and he commanded that his banner should be furled; and he did off the star of the north kingdom and gave it

then the prince imrahil and Ã©omer of rohan left him and passed through the city and the tumult of the people, and mounted to the citadel; and they came to the hall of the tower, seeking the steward. but they found his chair empty, and before the dais lay thÃ©oden king of the mark upon a bed of state; and twelve torches stood about it, and twelve guards, knights both of rohan and gondor. and the hangings of the bed were of green and white, but upon the king was laid the great cloth of gold up to his breast, and upon t

when they had stood silent for a time beside the king, imrahil said: â€˜where is the steward? and where also is mithrandir?â€™
and one of the guards answered: â€˜the steward of gondor is in the houses of healing.â€™
but Ã©omer said: â€˜where is the lady Ã©owyn, my sister; for surely she should be lying beside the king, and in no less honour? where have they bestowed her?â€™
and imrahil said: â€˜but the lady Ã©owyn was yet living when they bore her hither. did you not know?â€™
then hope unlooked-for came so suddenly to Ã©omerâ€™s heart, and with it the bite

and gandalf answered: â€˜she lies within and is not dead, but is near death. but the lord faramir was wounded by an evil dart, as you have heard, and he is now the steward; for denethor has departed, and his house is in ashes.â€™ and they were filled with grief and wonder at the tale that he told.
but imrahil said: â€˜so victory is shorn of gladness, and it is bitter bought, if both gondor and rohan are in one day bereft of their lords. Ã©omer rules the rohirrim. who shall rule the city meanwhile? shall we not send now for the lord aragorn?â€™
and the cloaked man spoke and said: â€˜he is come.â€™ and they saw as he stepped into the light of the lantern by the door that it was aragorn, wrapped in the grey cloak of lÃ³rien above his mail, and bearing no other token than the green stone of galadriel. â

â€˜strider! how splendid! do you know, i guessed it was you in the black ships. but they were all shouting corsairs and wouldnâ€™t listen to me. how did you do it?â€™
aragorn laughed, and took the hobbit by the hand. â€˜well met indeed!â€™ he said. â€˜but there is not time yet for travellersâ€™ tales.â€™
but imrahil said to Ã©omer: â€˜is it thus that we speak to our kings? yet maybe he will wear his crown in some other name!â€™
and aragorn hearing him, turned and said: â€˜verily, for in the high tongue of old i am elessar, the elfstone, and envinyatar, the renewerâ€™: and he lifted from his breast the green stone that lay there. â€˜but strider shall be the name of my house, if that be ever established. in the high tongue it will not sound so ill, and telcontar i will be and all the heirs of my body.â€™

â€˜he is nearly spent,â€™ said aragorn turning to gandalf. â€˜but this comes not from the wound. see! that is healing. had he been smitten by some dart of the nazgÃ»l, as you thought, he would have died that night. this hurt was given by some southron arrow, i would guess. who drew it forth? was it kept?â€™
â€˜i drew it forth,â€™ said imrahil, â€˜and staunched the wound. but i did not keep the arrow, for we had much to do. it was, as i remember, just such a dart as the southrons use. yet i believed that it came from the shadows above, for else his fever and sickness were not to be understood; since the wound was not deep or vital. how then do you read the matter?â€™
â€˜weariness, grief for his fatherâ€™s mood, a wound, and over all the black breath,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜he is a man of staunch will, for already he had come close under

â€˜walk no more in the shadows, but awake!â€™ said aragorn. â€˜you are weary. rest a while, and take food, and be ready when i return.â€™
â€˜i will, lord,â€™ said faramir. â€˜for who would lie idle when the king has returned?â€™
â€˜farewell then for a while!â€™ said aragorn. â€˜i must go to others who need me.â€™ and he left the chamber with gandalf and imrahil; but beregond and his son remained behind, unable to contain their joy. as he followed gandalf and shut the door pippin heard ioreth exclaim:
â€˜king! did you hear that? what did i say? the hands of a healer, i said.â€™ and soon the word had gone out from the house that the king was indeed come among them, and after war he brought healing; and the news ran through the city.
but aragorn came to Ã©owyn, and he said: â€˜here there is a grievous hurt and a heavy blow. the arm that was broken has be

â€˜they need more gardens,â€™ said legolas. â€˜the houses are dead, and there is too little here that grows and is glad. if aragorn comes into his own, the people of the wood shall bring him birds that sing and trees that do not die.â€™
at length they came to the prince imrahil, and legolas looked at him and bowed low; for he saw that here indeed was one who had elven-blood in his veins. â€˜hail, lord!â€™ he said. â€˜it is long since the people of nimrodel left the woodlands of lÃ³rien, and yet still one may see that not all sailed from amrothâ€™s haven west over water.â€™
â€˜so it is said in the lore of my land,â€™ said the prince; â€˜yet never has one of the fair folk been seen there for years beyond count. and i marvel to see one here now in the midst of sorrow and

â€˜i am one of the nine companions who set out with mithrandir from imladris, said legolas and with this dwarf, my friend, i came with the lord aragorn. but now we wish to see our friends. meriadoc and peregrin, who are in your keeping, we are told.â€™
â€˜you will find them in the houses of healing, and i will lead you thither,â€™ said imrahil.
â€˜it will be enough if you send one to guide us, lord,â€™ said legolas. â€˜for aragorn sends this message to you. he does not wish to enter the city again at this time. yet there is need for the captains to hold council at once, and he prays that you and Ã©omer of rohan will come down to his tents, as soon as may be. mithrandir is already there.â€™
â€˜we will come,â€™ said imrahil; and they parted with courteous words.
â€˜that is a fair lord and a great captain of men,â€™ said legolas. â€˜if

â€˜and i for the folk of the great wood,â€™ said legolas, â€˜and for the love of the lord of the white tree.â€™
then the companions fell silent, but a while they sat there in the high place, each busy with his own thoughts, while the captains debated.
when the prince imrahil had parted from legolas and gimli, at once he sent for Ã©omer; and he went down with him from the city, and they came to the tents of aragorn that were set up on the field not far from the place where king thÃ©oden had fallen. and there they took counsel together with gandalf and aragorn and the sons of elrond.
â€˜my lords,â€™ said gandalf, â€˜listen to the words of the steward of gondor before he died: you may triumph on the fields of the pelennor for a day, but against the power that has now

 victory cannot be achieved by arms, whether you sit here to endure siege after siege, or march out to be overwhelmed beyond the river. you have only a choice of evils; and prudence would counsel you to strengthen such strong places as you have, and there await the onset; for so shall the time before your end be made a little longer.â€™
â€˜then you would have us retreat to minas tirith, or dol amroth, or to dunharrow, and there sit like children on sand-castles when the tide is flowing?â€™ said imrahil.
â€˜that would be no new counsel,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜have you not done this and little more in all the days of denethor? but no! i said this would be prudent. i do not counsel prudence. i said victory could not be achieved by arms. i still hope for victory, but not by arms. for into the midst of all these policies comes the ring of power, the foundation of barad-dÃ»r, and the hope of sauron.
â€˜concerning this thing, my lords, you now all know enough for the understanding of our plight, and of

then said elrohir: â€˜from the north we came with this purpose, and from elrond our father we brought this very counsel. we will not turn back.â€™
â€˜as for myself,â€™ said Ã©omer, â€˜i have little knowledge of these deep matters; but i need it not. this i know, and it is enough, that as my friend aragorn succoured me and my people, so i will aid him when he calls. i will go.â€™
â€˜as for me,â€™ said imrahil, â€˜the lord aragorn i hold to be my liege-lord, whether he claim it or no. his wish is to me a command. i will go also. yet for a while i stand in the place of the steward of gondor, and it is mine to think first of its people. to prudence some heed must still be given. for we must prepare against all chances, good as well as evil. now, it may be that we shall triumph, and while there is any hope of this, gondor must be protected. i would not have us return with victory to a city in ruins and

â€˜the gate is destroyed,â€™ said imrahil, â€˜and where now is the skill to rebuild it and set it up anew?â€™
â€˜in erebor in the kingdom of dÃ¡in there is such skill,â€™ said aragorn; â€˜and if all our hopes do not perish, then in time i will send gimli glÃ³inâ€™s son to ask for wrights of the mountain. but men are better than gates, and no gate will endure against our enemy if men desert it.â€™
this then was the end of the debate of the lords: that they should set forth on the second morning from that day with seven thousands, if the

and when they had reckoned up all their strength and taken thought for the journeys they should make and the roads they should choose, imrahil suddenly laughed aloud.
â€˜surely,â€™ he cried, â€˜this is the greatest jest in all the history of gondor: that we should ride with seven thousands, scarce as many as the vanguard of its army in the days of its power, to assail the mountains and the impenetrable gate of the black land! so might a child threaten a mail-clad knight with a bow of string and green willow! if the dark lord knows so much as you say, mithrandir, will he not rather smile than fear, and with his little finger crush us l

now in their debate some had counselled that minas morgul should first be assailed, and if they might take it, it should be utterly destroyed. â€˜and, maybe,â€™ said imrahil, â€˜the road that leads thence to the pass above will prove an easier way of assault upon the dark lord than his northern gate.â€™
but against this gandalf had spoken urgently, because of the evil that dwelt in the valley, where the minds of living men would turn to madness and horror, and because also of the news that faramir had brought. for if the ring-bearer had indeed attempted that way, then above all they should not draw the eye of mordor thither. so the next day when the main host came

ever and anon gandalf let blow the trumpets, and the heralds would cry: â€œthe lords of gondor are come! let all leave this land or yield them up!â€™ but imrahil said: â€˜say not the lords of gondor. say the king elessar. for that is true, even though he has not yet sat upon the throne; and it will give the enemy more thought, if the heralds use that name.â€™ and thereafter thrice a day the heralds proclaimed the coming of the king elessar. but none answered the challenge.

set the host in such array as could best be contrived; and they were drawn up on two great hills of blasted stone and earth that orcs had piled in years of labour. before them towards mordor lay like a moat a great mire of reeking mud and foul-smelling pools. when all was ordered, the captains rode forth towards the black gate with a great guard of horsemen and the banner and heralds and trumpeters. there was gandalf as chief herald, and aragorn with the sons of elrond, and Ã©omer of rohan, and imrahil; and legolas and gimli and peregrin were bidden to go also, so that all the enemies of mordor should have a witness.

â€˜silence!â€™ said gandalf sternly, thrusting him back; but the messenger laughed aloud.
â€˜so you have yet another of these imps with you!â€™ he cried. â€˜what use you find in them i cannot guess; but to send them as spies into mordor is beyond even your accustomed folly. still, i thank him, for it is plain that this brat at least has seen these tokens before, and it would be vain for you to deny them now.â€™

the wind blew, and the trumpets sang, and arrows whined; but the sun now climbing towards the south was veiled in the reeks of mordor, and through a threatening haze it gleamed, remote, a sullen red, as if it were the ending of the day, or the end maybe of all the world of light. and out of the gathering mirk the nazgÃ»l came with. their cold voices crying words of death; and then all hope was quenched.

â€˜i wish merry was here,â€™ he heard himself saying, and quick thoughts raced through his mind, even as he watched the enemy come charging to the assault. â€˜well, well, now at any rate i understand poor denethor a little better. we might die together, merry and i, and since die we must, why not? well, as he is not here, i hope heâ€™ll find an easier end. but now i must do my best.â€™

â€˜no, master! mr. bilbo gave it to you, and it goes with his silver coat; he would not wish anyone else to wear it now.â€™
frodo gave way; and gandalf, as if he were their esquire, knelt and girt the sword-belts about them, and then rising he set circlets of silver upon their heads. and when they were arrayed they went to the great feast; and they sat at the kingâ€™s table with gandalf, and king Ã©omer of rohan, and the prince imrahil and all the chief captains; and there also were gimli and legolas.
