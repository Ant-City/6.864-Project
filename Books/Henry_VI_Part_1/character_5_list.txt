Talbot - 
      General of the English troops in France, Talbot is so feared by the French that, when he is captured, they have archers guard him even while he sleeps. After being released, he conquers many towns and fortifications in France, until he encounters Joan. Joan breaks the Britons' siege on Orleans, but Talbot still beats the French several more times, until he is trapped at Bordeaux, where he and his son John are killed. Talbot represents a dying breed of noble chivalrous soldiers fighting for the honor of king and country. When he falls, the last of a valorous line dies out.
