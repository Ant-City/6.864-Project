tarting a
benefit society for the poor students and sunday schools; and how he had
afterwards been a teacher in a peasant school, and how he had been
driven out of that too, and had afterwards been condemned for something.

"youâ€™re of the kiev university?" said konstantin levin to kritsky, to
break the awkward silence that followed.

"yes, i was of kiev," kritsky replied angrily, his face darkening.

"and this woman," nikolay levin interrupted him, pointing to her, "is
the partner of my life, marya nikolaevna. i took her out of a bad
house," and he jerked his neck saying this; "but i love her and respect
her, and any one who wants to know me," he added, raising his voice and
knitting his brows, "i beg to love her and respect her. sheâ€™s just the
same as my wife, just the same. so now you know whom youâ€™ve to do with.
and if you think youâ€™re lowering yourself, well, hereâ€™s the floor,
thereâ€™s the door."

and again his eyes traveled inquiringly over all of them.

"why i should be lowering mysel

ey ivanovitch? iâ€™ll tell you what for!" nikolay levin shrieked
suddenly at the name of sergey ivanovitch. "iâ€™ll tell you what for....
but whatâ€™s the use of talking? thereâ€™s only one thing.... what did you
come to me for? you look down on this, and youâ€™re welcome to,â€”and go
away, in godâ€™s name go away!" he shrieked, getting up from his chair.
"and go away, and go away!"

"i donâ€™t look down on it at all," said konstantin levin timidly. "i
donâ€™t even dispute it."

at that instant marya nikolaevna came back. nikolay levin looked round
angrily at her. she went quickly to him, and whispered something.

"iâ€™m not well; iâ€™ve grown irritable," said nikolay levin, getting calmer
and breathing painfully; "and then you talk to me of sergey ivanovitch
and his article. itâ€™s such rubbish, such lying, such self-deception.
what can a man write of justice who knows nothing of it? have you read
his article?" he asked kritsky, sitting down again at the table, and

everyone was mute. kritsky got up deliberately and reached his cap.

"wonâ€™t you have supper? all right, good-bye! come round tomorrow with
the locksmith."

kritsky had hardly gone out when nikolay levin smiled and winked.

"heâ€™s no good either," he said. "i see, of course..."

but at that instant kritsky, at the door, called him...

"what do you want now?" he said, and went out to him in the passage.
left alone with marya nikolaevna, levin turned to her.

"have you been long with my brother?" he said to her.

"yes, more than a year. nikolay dmitrievitchâ€™s health has become very
poor. nikolay dmitrievitch drinks a great deal," she said.

"that is ... how does he drink?"

"drinks vodka, and itâ€™s bad for him."

"and a great deal?" whispered levin.

"yes," she said, looking timidly towards the doorway, where nikolay
levin had reappeared.

"what were you talking about?" he said, knitting his brows, and turning
his scared ey

both wrong. youâ€™re more wrong externally, and he inwardly."

"ah, ah! you see that, you see that!" nikolay shouted joyfully.

"but i personally value friendly relations with you more because..."

"why, why?"

konstantin could not say that he valued it more because nikolay was
unhappy, and needed affection. but nikolay knew that this was just what
he meant to say, and scowling he took up the vodka again.

"enough, nikolay dmitrievitch!" said marya nikolaevna, stretching out
her plump, bare arm towards the decanter.

"let it be! donâ€™t insist! iâ€™ll beat you!" he shouted.

marya nikolaevna smiled a sweet and good-humored smile, which was at
once reflected on nikolayâ€™s face, and she took the bottle.

"and do you suppose she understands nothing?" said nikolay. "she
understands it all better than any of us. isnâ€™t it true thereâ€™s
something good and sweet in her?"

"were you never before in moscow?" konstantin said to her, for the sake

s lovely spring roused levin still
more, and strengthened him in his resolution of renouncing all his past
and building up his lonely life firmly and independently. though many of
the plans with which he had returned to the country had not been carried
out, still his most important resolutionâ€”that of purityâ€”had been kept by
him. he was free from that shame, which had usually harassed him after a
fall; and he could look everyone straight in the face. in february he
had received a letter from marya nikolaevna telling him that his brother
nikolayâ€™s health was getting worse, but that he would not take advice,
and in consequence of this letter levin went to moscow to his brotherâ€™s
and succeeded in persuading him to see a doctor and to go to a
watering-place abroad. he succeeded so well in persuading his brother,
and in lending him money for the journey without irritating him, that he
was satisfied with himself in that matter. in addition to his farming,
which called for special attention in spring,

who attracted universal and
unfavorable attention. these were a tall man with a stooping figure, and
huge hands, in an old coat too short for him, with black, simple, and
yet terrible eyes, and a pockmarked, kind-looking woman, very badly and
tastelessly dressed. recognizing these persons as russians, kitty had
already in her imagination begun constructing a delightful and touching
romance about them. but the princess, having ascertained from the
visitorsâ€™ list that this was nikolay levin and marya nikolaevna,
explained to kitty what a bad man this levin was, and all her fancies
about these two people vanished. not so much from what her mother told
her, as from the fact that it was konstantinâ€™s brother, this pair
suddenly seemed to kitty intensely unpleasant. this levin, with his
continual twitching of his head, aroused in her now an irrepressible
feeling of disgust.

it seemed to her that his big, terrible eyes, which persistently pursued
her, expressed a feeling of hatred and contempt, and she t

 the old servants. the news of the death of parfen denisitch
made a painful impression on him. a look of fear crossed his face, but
he regained his serenity immediately.

"of course he was quite old," he said, and changed the subject. "well,
iâ€™ll spend a month or two with you, and then iâ€™m off to moscow. do you
know, myakov has promised me a place there, and iâ€™m going into the
service. now iâ€™m going to arrange my life quite differently," he went
on. "you know i got rid of that woman."

"marya nikolaevna? why, what for?"

"oh, she was a horrid woman! she caused me all sorts of worries." but he
did not say what the annoyances were. he could not say that he had cast
off marya nikolaevna because the tea was weak, and, above all, because
she would look after him, as though he were an invalid.

"besides, i want to turn over a new leaf completely now. iâ€™ve done silly
things, of course, like everyone else, but moneyâ€™s the last
consideration; i donâ€™t regret it. so long as thereâ€™s health, and my

 i opened your letter too," said kitty, handing him an illiterate
letter. "itâ€™s from that woman, i think, your brotherâ€™s..." she said. "i
did not read it through. this is from my people and from dolly. fancy!
dolly took tanya and grisha to a childrenâ€™s ball at the sarmatskysâ€™:
tanya was a french marquise."

but levin did not hear her. flushing, he took the letter from marya
nikolaevna, his brotherâ€™s former mistress, and began to read it. this
was the second letter he had received from marya nikolaevna. in the
first letter, marya nikolaevna wrote that his brother had sent her away
for no fault of hers, and, with touching simplicity, added that though
she was in want again, she asked for nothing, and wished for nothing,
but was only tormented by the thought that nikolay dmitrievitch would
come to grief without her, owing to the weak state of his health, and
begged his brother to look after him. now she wrote quite differently.
she had found nikolay dmitrievitch, had again made it up with him i

 her. but she did not heed him, and would not agree to anything.
he bent down to her and took her hand, which resisted him. he kissed her
hand, kissed her hair, kissed her hand againâ€”still she was silent. but
when he took her face in both his hands and said "kitty!" she suddenly
recovered herself, and began to cry, and they were reconciled.

it was decided that they should go together the next day. levin told his
wife that he believed she wanted to go simply in order to be of use,
agreed that marya nikolaevnaâ€™s being with his brother did not make her
going improper, but he set off at the bottom of his heart dissatisfied
both with her and with himself. he was dissatisfied with her for being
unable to make up her mind to let him go when it was necessary (and how
strange it was for him to think that he, so lately hardly daring to
believe in such happiness as that she could love himâ€”now was unhappy
because she loved him too much!), and he was dissatisfied with himself
for not showing more strength o

ed him.

"iâ€™ll go away. iâ€™ll go down to the kitchen," she brought out. "nikolay
dmitrievitch will be delighted. he heard about it, and knows your lady,
and remembers her abroad."

levin realized that she meant his wife, and did not know what answer to
make.

"come along, come along to him!" he said.

but as soon as he moved, the door of his room opened and kitty peeped
out. levin crimsoned both from shame and anger with his wife, who had
put herself and him in such a difficult position; but marya nikolaevna
crimsoned still more. she positively shrank together and flushed to the
point of tears, and clutching the ends of her apron in both hands,
twisted them in her red fingers without knowing what to say and what to
do.

for the first instant levin saw an expression of eager curiosity in the
eyes with which kitty looked at this awful woman, so incomprehensible to
her; but it lasted only a single instant.

"well! how is he?" she turned to her husband and then to her.

"but one canâ€™t go on talking i

n the passage like this!" levin said,
looking angrily at a gentleman who walked jauntily at that instant
across the corridor, as though about his affairs.

"well then, come in," said kitty, turning to marya nikolaevna, who had
recovered herself, but noticing her husbandâ€™s face of dismay, "or go on;
go, and then come for me," she said, and went back into the room.

levin went to his brotherâ€™s room. he had not in the least expected what
he saw and felt in his brotherâ€™s room. he had expected to find him in
the same state of self-deception which he had heard was so frequent with
the consumptive, and which had struck him so much during his brotherâ€™s
visit in the autumn. he had expected to find the physica

t up and took him by the elbow with both hands.

"kostya! take me to him; it will be easier for us to bear it together.
you only take me, take me to him, please, and go away," she said. "you
must understand that for me to see you, and not to see him, is far more
painful. there i might be a help to you and to him. please, let me!" she
besought her husband, as though the happiness of her life depended on
it.

levin was obliged to agree, and regaining his composure, and completely
forgetting about marya nikolaevna by now, he went again in to his
brother with kitty.

stepping lightly, and continually glancing at her husband, showing him a
valorous and sympathetic face, kitty went into the sick-room, and,
turning without haste, noiselessly closed the door. with inaudible steps
she went quickly to the sick manâ€™s bedside, and going up so that he had
not to turn his head, she immediately clasped in her fresh young hand
the skeleton of his huge hand, pressed it, and began speaking with that
soft eagerness, s
 
 ___________________________
 
hat feeling of horror and loathing that it aroused in her
husband, but a desire to act, to find out all the details of his state,
and to remedy them. and since she had not the slightest doubt that it
was her duty to help him, she had no doubt either that it was possible,
and immediately set to work. the very details, the mere thought of which
reduced her husband to terror, immediately engaged her attention. she
sent for the doctor, sent to the chemistâ€™s, set the maid who had come
with her and marya nikolaevna to sweep and dust and scrub; she herself
washed up something, washed out something else, laid something under the
quilt. something was by her directions brought into the sick-room,
something else was carried out. she herself went several times to her
room, regardless of the men she met in the corridor, got out and brought
in sheets, pillow cases, towels, and shirts.

the waiter, who was busy with a party of engineers dining in the dining
hall, came several times with an irate countenance in ans

ent would be angry at it. but
the sick man, though he seemed and was indifferent about it, was not
angry, but only abashed, and on the whole as it were interested in what
she was doing with him. coming back from the doctor to whom kitty had
sent him, levin, on opening the door, came upon the sick man at the
instant when, by kittyâ€™s directions, they were changing his linen. the
long white ridge of his spine, with the huge, prominent shoulder blades
and jutting ribs and vertebrae, was bare, and marya nikolaevna and the
waiter were struggling with the sleeve of the night shirt, and could not
get the long, limp arm into it. kitty, hurriedly closing the door after
levin, was not looking that way; but the sick man groaned, and she moved
rapidly towards him.

"make haste," she said.

"oh, donâ€™t you come," said the sick man angrily. "iâ€™ll do it my
myself...."

"what say?" queried marya nikolaevna. but kitty heard and saw he was
ashamed and uncomfortable at being naked before her.

"iâ€™m not looking, iâ

anged his mind, let
it go, and only stroked it. kitty took his hand in both hers and pressed
it.

"now turn me over on the left side and go to bed," he said.

no one could make out what he said but kitty; she alone understood. she
understood because she was all the while mentally keeping watch on what
he needed.

"on the other side," she said to her husband, "he always sleeps on that
side. turn him over, itâ€™s so disagreeable calling the servants. iâ€™m not
strong enough. can you?" she said to marya nikolaevna.

"iâ€™m afraid not," answered marya nikolaevna.

terrible as it was to levin to put his arms round that terrible body, to
take hold of that under the quilt, of which he preferred to know
nothing, under his wifeâ€™s influence he made his resolute face that she
knew so well, and putting his arms into the bed took hold of the body,
but in spite of his own strength he was struck by the strange heaviness
of those powerless limbs. while he was turning him over, conscious of
the huge emaciated arm ab

all the ceremonies of going to church, saying her prayers, and so on,
always with the unvarying conviction that this ought to be so. in spite
of his assertion to the contrary, she was firmly persuaded that he was
as much a christian as she, and indeed a far better one; and all that he
said about it was simply one of his absurd masculine freaks, just as he
would say about her _broderie anglaise_ that good people patch holes,
but that she cut them on purpose, and so on.

"yes, you see this woman, marya nikolaevna, did not know how to manage
all this," said levin. "and ... i must own iâ€™m very, very glad you came.
you are such purity that...." he took her hand and did not kiss it (to
kiss her hand in such closeness to death seemed to him improper); he
merely squeezed it with a penitent air, looking at her brightening eyes.

"it would have been miserable for you to be alone," she said, and
lifting her hands which hid her cheeks flushing with pleasure, twisted
her coil of hair on the nape of her neck and

on of the
doctorâ€™s words that inhaling iodine worked wonders.

"is katya not here?" he gasped, looking round while levin reluctantly
assented to the doctorâ€™s words. "no; so i can say it.... it was for her
sake i went through that farce. sheâ€™s so sweet; but you and i canâ€™t
deceive ourselves. this is what i believe in," he said, and, squeezing
the bottle in his bony hand, he began breathing over it.

at eight oâ€™clock in the evening levin and his wife were drinking tea in
their room when marya nikolaevna ran in to them breathlessly. she was
pale, and her lips were quivering. "he is dying!" she whispered. "iâ€™m
afraid will die this minute."

both of them ran to him. he was sitting raised up with one elbow on the
bed, his long back bent, and his head hanging low.

"how do you feel?" levin asked in a whisper, after a silence.

"i feel iâ€™m setting off," nikolay said with difficulty, but with extreme
distinctness, screwing the words out of himself. he did not raise his
head, but simply turned his
 
 ___________________________
 
 eyes upwards, without their reaching his
brotherâ€™s face. "katya, go away!" he added.

levin jumped up, and with a peremptory whisper made her go out.

"iâ€™m setting off," he said again.

"why do you think so?" said levin, so as to say something.

"because iâ€™m setting off," he repeated, as though he had a liking for
the phrase. "itâ€™s the end."

marya nikolaevna went up to him.

"you had better lie down; youâ€™d be easier," she said.

"i shall lie down soon enough," he pronounced slowly, "when iâ€™m dead,"
he said sarcastically, wrathfully. "well, you can lay me down if you
like."

levin laid his brother on his back, sat down beside him, and gazed at
his face, holding his breath. the dying man lay with closed eyes, but
the muscles twitched from time to time on his forehead, as with one
thinking deeply and intensely. levin involuntarily thought with him

 of
what it was that was happening to him now, but in spite of all his
mental efforts to go along with him he saw by the expression of that
calm, stern face that for the dying man all was growing clearer and
clearer that was still as dark as ever for levin.

"yes, yes, so," the dying man articulated slowly at intervals. "wait a
little." he was silent. "right!" he pronounced all at once reassuringly,
as though all were solved for him. "o lord!" he murmured, and sighed
deeply.

marya nikolaevna felt his feet. "theyâ€™re getting cold," she whispered.

for a long while, a very long while it seemed to levin, the sick man lay
motionless. but he was still alive, and from time to time he sighed.
levin by now was exhausted from mental strain. he felt that, with no
mental effort, could he understand what it was that was _right_. he
could not even think of the problem of death itself, but with no will of
his own thoughts kept coming to him of what he had to do next; closing
the dead manâ€™s ey

gged his brotherâ€™s forgiveness.

the sick man said nothing.

"what am i to write to him?" said levin. "i hope you are not angry with
him?"

"no, not the least!" nikolay answered, vexed at the question. "tell him
to send me a doctor."

three more days of agony followed; the sick man was still in the same
condition. the sense of longing for his death was felt by everyone now
at the mere sight of him, by the waiters and the hotel-keeper and all
the people staying in the hotel, and the doctor and marya nikolaevna and
levin and kitty. the sick man alone did not express this feeling, but on
the contrary was furious at their not getting him doctors, and went on
taking medicine and talking of life. only at rare moments, when the
opium gave him an instantâ€™s relief from the never-ceasing pain, he would
sometimes, half asleep, utter what was ever more intense in his heart
than in all the others: "oh, if it were only the end!" or: "when will it
be over?"

his sufferings, steadily growing more intense, did the

he indisposition arose from fatigue and
excitement, and prescribed rest.

after dinner, however, kitty got up and went as usual with her work to
the sick man. he looked at her sternly when she came in, and smiled
contemptuously when she said she had been unwell. that day he was
continually blowing his nose, and groaning piteously.

"how do you feel?" she asked him.

"worse," he articulated with difficulty. "in pain!"

"in pain, where?"

"everywhere."

"it will be over today, you will see," said marya nikolaevna. though it
was said in a whisper, the sick man, whose hearing levin had noticed was
very keen, must have heard. levin said hush to her, and looked round at
the sick man. nikolay had heard; but these words produced no effect on
him. his eyes had still the same intense, reproachful look.

"why do you think so?" levin asked her, when she had followed him into
the corridor.

"he has begun picking at himself," said marya nikolaevna.

"how do you mean?"

"like this," she said, tugging at the folds of

 her woolen skirt. levin
noticed, indeed, that all that day the patient pulled at himself, as it
were, trying to snatch something away.

marya nikolaevnaâ€™s prediction came true. towards night the sick man was
not able to lift his hands, and could only gaze before him with the same
intensely concentrated expression in his eyes. even when his brother or
kitty bent over him, so that he could see them, he looked just the same.
kitty sent for the priest to read the prayer for the dying.

while the priest was reading it, the dying man did not show any sign of
life; his eyes were closed. levin, kitty, and marya nikolaevna stood at
the bedside. the pr
