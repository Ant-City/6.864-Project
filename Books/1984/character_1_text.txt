on, her youth and
prettiness had frightened him, he was too much used to living without
women--he did not know the reason. the girl picked herself up and pulled a
bluebell out of her hair. she sat against him, putting her arm round his
waist.

'never mind, dear. there's no hurry. we've got the whole afternoon. isn't
this a splendid hide-out? i found it when i got lost once on a community
hike. if anyone was coming you could hear them a hundred metres away.'

'what is your name?' said winston.

'julia. i know yours. it's winston--winston smith.'

'how did you find that out?'

'i expect i'm better at finding things out than you are, dear. tell me,
what did you think of me before that day i gave you the note?'

he did not feel any temptation to tell lies to her. it was even a sort of
love-offering to start off by telling the worst.

'i hated the sight of you,' he said. 'i wanted to rape you and then murder
you afterwards. two weeks ago i thought seriously of smashing your head in
with a cobble

them, it appeared, meant the party, and above all the inner party, about
whom she talked with an open jeering hatred which made winston feel uneasy,
although he knew that they were safe here if they could be safe anywhere.
a thing that astonished him about her was the coarseness of her language.
party members were supposed not to swear, and winston himself very seldom
did swear, aloud, at any rate. julia, however, seemed unable to mention
the party, and especially the inner party, without using the kind of words
that you saw chalked up in dripping alley-ways. he did not dislike it. it
was merely one symptom of her revolt against the party and all its ways,
and somehow it seemed natural and healthy, like the sneeze of a horse that
smells bad hay. they had left the clearing and were wandering again
through the chequered shade, with their arms round each other's waists
whenever it was wide enough

to walk two abreast. he noticed how much
softer her waist seemed to feel now that the sash was gone. they did not
speak above a whisper. outside the clearing, julia said, it was better to
go quietly. presently they had reached the edge of the little wood. she
stopped him.

'don't go out into the open. there might be someone watching. we're all
right if we keep behind the boughs.'

they were standing in the shade of hazel bushes. the sunlight, filtering
through innumerable leaves, was still hot on their faces. winston looked
out into the field beyond, and underwent a curious, slow shock of
recognition. he knew it by sight. an old, close-bitten pasture, with

ut of sight,
there must be a stream with green pools where dace were swimming?

'isn't there a stream somewhere near here?' he whispered.

'that's right, there is a stream. it's at the edge of the next field,
actually. there are fish in it, great big ones. you can watch them lying
in the pools under the willow trees, waving their tails.'

'it's the golden country--almost,' he murmured.

'the golden country?'

'it's nothing, really. a landscape i've seen sometimes in a dream.'

'look!' whispered julia.

a thrush had alighted on a bough not five metres away, almost at the level
of their faces. perhaps it had not seen them. it was in the sun, they in
the shade. it spread out its wings, fitted them carefully into place
again, ducked its head for a moment, as though making a sort of obeisance
to the sun, and then began to pour forth a torrent of song. in the
afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling. winston and julia clung
together, fascinated. the music went on and on, minute after minu

t as though the
bird were deliberately showing off its virtuosity. sometimes it stopped
for a few seconds, spread out and resettled its wings, then swelled its
speckled breast and again burst into song. winston watched it with a sort
of vague reverence. for whom, for what, was that bird singing? no mate,
no rival was watching it. what made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood
and pour its music into nothingness? he wondered whether after all there
was a microphone hidden somewhere near. he and julia had spoken only in
low whispers, and it would not pick up what they had said, but it would
pick up the thrush. perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small,
beetle-like man was listening intently--listening to that. but by degrees
the flood of music drove all speculations out of his mind. it was as
though it were a kind of liquid stuff that poured all over him and got
mixed up with the sunlight that filtered through the leaves. he stopped
thinking and merely felt. the girl's waist in t

he pulled the overalls aside and studied her smooth white flank. in the
old days, he thought, a man looked at a girl's body and saw that it was
desirable, and that was the end of the story. but you could not have pure
love or pure lust nowadays. no emotion was pure, because everything was
mixed up with fear and hatred. their embrace had been a battle, the climax
a victory. it was a blow struck against the party. it was a political act.

'we can come here once again,' said julia. 'it's generally safe to use any
hide-out twice. but not for another month or two, of course.'

as soon as she woke up her demeanour had changed. she became alert and
business-like, put her clothes on, knotted the scarlet sash about her
waist, and began arranging the details of the journey home. it seemed
natural to leave this to her. she obviously had a practical cunning which
winston lacked, and she seemed also to have an exhaustive knowledge of the
countryside round london, stored away from

ed her way through the saplings and disappeared into the wood
with very little noise. even now he had not found out her surname or her
address. however, it made no difference, for it was inconceivable that
they could ever meet indoors or exchange any kind of written communication.

as it happened, they never went back to the clearing in the wood. during
the month of may there was only one further occasion on which they actually
succeeded in making love. that was in another hiding-place known to julia,
the belfry of a ruinous church in an almost-deserted stretch of country
where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier. it was a good
hiding-place when once you got there, but the getting there was very
dangerous. for the rest they could meet only in the streets, in a different
place every evening and never for more than half an hour at a time. in the
street it was usually possible to talk, after a fashion. as they drifted
down the crowded pavements, not quite abreast and never looking a

another, they carried on a curious, intermittent conversation which flicked
on and off like the beams of a lighthouse, suddenly nipped into silence
by the approach of a party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen, then
taken up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence, then abruptly
cut short as they parted at the agreed spot, then continued almost without
introduction on the following day. julia appeared to be quite used to this
kind of conversation, which she called 'talking by instalments'. she was
also surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips. just once in
almost a month of nightly meetings they managed to exchange a kiss. they
were passing in silence down a side-street (julia would never speak when
they were away from the main streets) when there was a deafening roar, the
earth heaved, and the air darkened, and winston found himself lying on his
side, bruised and terr

ified. a rocket bomb must have dropped quite near at
hand. suddenly he became aware of julia's face a few centimetres from his
own, deathly white, as white as chalk. even her lips were white. she was
dead! he clasped her against him and found that he was kissing a live
warm face. but there was some powdery stuff that got in the way of his
lips. both of their faces were thickly coated with plaster.

there were evenings when they reached their rendezvous and then had to
walk past one another without a sign, because a patrol had just come round
the corner or a helicopter was hovering over

head. even if it had been
less dangerous, it would still have been difficult to find time to meet.
winston's working week was sixty hours, julia's was even longer, and
their free days varied according to the pressure of work and did not
often coincide. julia, in any case, seldom had an evening completely free.
she spent an astonishing amount of time in attending lectures and
demonstrations, distributing literature for the junior anti-sex league,
preparing banners for hate week, making collections for the savings
campaign, and such-like activities. it paid, she said, it was camouflage.
if you kept the small rules, you could break the big ones. she even induced
winston to mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling himself for

hammers mingled drearily with the music of the telescreens.

when they met in the church tower the gaps in their fragmentary
conversation were filled up. it was a blazing afternoon. the air in the
little square chamber above the bells was hot and stagnant, and smelt
overpoweringly of pigeon dung. they sat talking for hours on the dusty,
twig-littered floor, one or other of them getting up from time to time to
cast a glance through the arrowslits and make sure that no one was coming.

julia was twenty-six years old. she lived in a hostel with thirty other
girls ('always in the stink of women! how i hate women!' she said
parenthetically), and she worked, as he had guessed, on the novel-writing
machines in the fiction department. she enjoyed her work, which consisted
chiefly in running and servicing a powerful but tricky electric motor.
she was 'not clever', but was fond of using her hands and felt at home
with machinery. she could describe the whole process of composing a novel,

heads of the departments, were girls. the theory was that men, whose sex
instincts were less controllable than those of women, were in greater
danger of being corrupted by the filth they handled.

'they don't even like having married women there,' she added. girls are
always supposed to be so pure. here's one who isn't, anyway.

she had had her first love-affair when she was sixteen, with a party member
of sixty who later committed suicide to avoid arrest. 'and a good job too,'
said julia, 'otherwise they'd have had my name out of him when he
confessed.' since then there had been various others. life as she saw it
was quite simple. you wanted a good time; 'they', meaning the party,
wanted to stop you having it; you broke the rules as best you could. she
seemed to think it just as natural that 'they' should want to rob you of
your pleasures as that you should want to avoid being caught. she hated
the party, and said so in the crudest words, but she made no general
criticism of it

the revolution, knowing nothing else, accepting the party as something
unalterable, like the sky, not rebelling against its authority but simply
evading it, as a rabbit dodges a dog.

they did not discuss the possibility of getting married. it was too remote
to be worth thinking about. no imaginable committee would ever sanction
such a marriage even if katharine, winston's wife, could somehow have been
got rid of. it was hopeless even as a daydream.

'what was she like, your wife?' said julia.

'she was--do you know the newspeak word goodthinkful? meaning naturally
orthodox, incapable of thinking a bad thought?'

'no, i didn't know the word, but i know the kind of person, right enough.'

he began telling her the story of his married life, but curiously enough
she appeared to know the essential parts of it already. she described
to him, almost as though she had seen or felt it, the stiffening of
katharine's body as soon as he touched her, the way in which she still
seemed to be pushi

ng him from her with all her strength, even when her
arms were clasped tightly round him. with julia he felt no difficulty in
talking about such things: katharine, in any case, had long ceased to be
a painful memory and became merely a distasteful one.

'i could have stood it if it hadn't been for one thing,' he said. he told
her about the frigid little ceremony that katharine had forced him to go
through on the same night every week. 'she hated it, but nothing would
make her stop doing it. she used to call it--but you'll never guess.'

'our duty to the party,' said julia promptly.

'how did y

'i've been at school too, dear. sex talks once a month for the
over-sixteens. and in the youth movement. they rub it into you for years.
i dare say it works in a lot of cases. but of course you can never tell;
people are such hypocrites.'

she began to enlarge upon the subject. with julia, everything came back
to her own sexuality. as soon as this was touched upon in any way she was
capable of great acuteness. unlike winston, she had grasped the inner
meaning of the party's sexual puritanism. it was not merely that the sex
instinct created a world of its own which was outside the party's control
and which therefore had to be destroyed if possible. what was more
important was that sexual privation induced hysteria, which was desirable
because it could be transformed into war-feve

of the thought police. it was a device by means of which everyone could be
surrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately.

abruptly his mind went back to katharine. katharine would unquestionably
have denounced him to the thought police if she had not happened to be too
stupid to detect the unorthodoxy of his opinions. but what really recalled
her to him at this moment was the stifling heat of the afternoon, which
had brought the sweat out on his forehead. he began telling julia of
something that had happened, or rather had failed to happen, on another
sweltering summer afternoon, eleven years ago.

it was three or four months after they were married. they had lost their
way on a community hike somewhere in kent. they had only lagged behind
the others for a couple of minutes, but they took a wrong turning, and
presently found themselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalk
quarry. it was a sheer drop of ten or twenty metres, with boulders at the
bottom. there wa

at this moment it suddenly occurred to him how
completely alone they were. there was not a human creature anywhere, not a
leaf stirring, not even a bird awake. in a place like this the danger that
there would be a hidden microphone was very small, and even if there was a
microphone it would only pick up sounds. it was the hottest sleepiest hour
of the afternoon. the sun blazed down upon them, the sweat tickled his
face. and the thought struck him...

'why didn't you give her a good shove?' said julia. 'i would have.'

'yes, dear, you would have. i would, if i'd been the same person then as
i am now. or perhaps i would--i'm not certain.'

'are you sorry you didn't?'

'yes. on the whole i'm sorry i didn't.'

they were sitting side by side on the dusty floor. he pulled her closer
against him. her head rested on his shoulder, the pleasant smell of her
hair conquering the pigeon dung. she was very young, he thought, she
still expected something from life, she did not understand that to push

 and kill her, but with another part of her mind she believed
that it was somehow possible to construct a secret world in which you could
live as you chose. all you needed was luck and cunning and boldness. she
did not understand that there was no such thing as happiness, that the
only victory lay in the far future, long after you were dead, that from
the moment of declaring war on the party it was better to think of yourself
as a corpse.

'we are the dead,' he said.

'we're not dead yet,' said julia prosaically.

'not physically. six months, a year--five years, conceivably. i am afraid
of death. you are young, so presumably you're more afraid of it than i am.
obviously we shall put it off as long as we can. but it makes very little
difference. so long as human beings stay human, death and life are the
same thing.'

'oh, rubbish! which would you sooner sleep with, me or a skeleton? don't
you enjoy being alive? don't you like feeling: this is me, this is my hand,
this is my leg, i'm real, i'

visit to the church belfry it had been impossible to arrange
meetings. working hours had been drastically increased in anticipation of
hate week. it was more than a month distant, but the enormous, complex
preparations that it entailed were throwing extra work on to everybody.
finally both of them managed to secure a free afternoon on the same day.
they had agreed to go back to the clearing in the wood. on the evening
beforehand they met briefly in the street. as usual, winston hardly looked
at julia as they drifted towards one another in the crowd, but from the
short glance he gave her it seemed to him that she was paler than usual.

'it's all off,' she murmured as soon as she judged it safe to speak.
'tomorrow, i mean.'

'what?'

'tomorrow afternoon. i can't come.'

'why not?'

'oh, the usual reason. it's started early this time.'

for a moment he was violently angry. during the month that he had known
her the nature of his desire for her had changed. at the beginning there

walking through the streets with her just as they were doing now but openly
and without fear, talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for the
household. he wished above all that they had some place where they could
be alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every time
they met. it was not actually at that moment, but at some time on the
following day, that the idea of renting mr charrington's room had occurred
to him. when he suggested it to julia she had agreed with unexpected
readiness. both of them knew that it was lunacy. it was as though they were
intentionally stepping nearer to their graves. as he sat waiting on the
edge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the ministry of love.
it was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of one's
consciousness. there it lay, fixed in future times, preceding death as
surely as 99 precedes 100. one could not avoid it, but one could perhaps
postpone it: and yet instead, ever

act, one chose to shorten the interval before it happened.

at this moment there was a quick step on the stairs. julia burst into the
room. she was carrying a tool-bag of coarse brown canvas, such as he had
sometimes seen her carrying to and fro at the ministry. he started forward
to take her in his arms, but she disengaged herself rather hurriedly,
partly because she was still holding the tool-bag.

'half a second,' she said. 'just let me show you what i've brought. did
you bring some of that filthy victory coffee? i thought you would. you
can chuck it away again, because we shan't be needing it. look here.'

ne evening had been endless and the supply of clothes
inexhaustible, to remain there for a thousand years, pegging out diapers
and singing rubbish. it struck him as a curious fact that he had never
heard a member of the party singing alone and spontaneously. it would even
have seemed slightly unorthodox, a dangerous eccentricity, like talking to
oneself. perhaps it was only when people were somewhere near the starvation
level that they had anything to sing about.

'you can turn round now,' said julia.

he turned round, and for a second almost failed to recognize her. what he
had actually expected was to see her naked. but she was not naked. the
transformation that had happened was much more surprising than that. she
had painted her face.

she must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian quarters and bought
herself a complete set of make-up materials. her lips were deeply reddened,
her cheeks rouged, her nose powdered; there was even a touch of something
under the eyes to make them br

they flung their clothes off and climbed into the huge mahogany bed. it
was the first time that he had stripped himself naked in her presence.
until now he had been too much ashamed of his pale and meagre body, with
the varicose veins standing out on his calves and the discoloured patch
over his ankle. there were no sheets, but the blanket they lay on was
threadbare and smooth, and the size and springiness of the bed astonished
both of them. 'it's sure to be full of bugs, but who cares?' said julia.
one never saw a double bed nowadays, except in the homes of the proles.
winston had occasionally slept in one in his boyhood: julia had never been
in one before, so far as she could remember.

presently they fell asleep for a little while. when winston woke up the
hands of the clock had crept round to nearly nine. he did not stir, because
julia was sleeping with her head in the crook of his arm. most of her
make-up had transferred itself to his own face or the bolster, but a light

the woman had stopped singing, but the faint shouts of children floated in
from the street. he wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past it had
been a normal experience to lie in bed like this, in the cool of a summer
evening, a man and a woman with no clothes on, making love when they chose,
talking of what they chose, not feeling any compulsion to get up, simply
lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside. surely there could
never have been a time when that seemed ordinary? julia woke up, rubbed
her eyes, and raised herself on her elbow to look at the oilstove.

'half that water's boiled away,' she said. 'i'll get up and make some
coffee in another moment. we've got an hour. what time do they cut the
lights off at your flats?'

'twenty-three thirty.'

'it's twenty-three at the hostel. but you have to get in earlier than that,
because--hi! get out, you filthy brute!'

she suddenly twisted herself over in the bed, seized a shoe from the floor,
and sent it hurtling into th

as he had seen her fling the dictionary at goldstein, that morning during

'what was it?' he said in surprise.

'a rat. i saw him stick his beastly nose out of the wainscoting. there's a
hole down there. i gave him a good fright, anyway.'

'rats!' murmured winston. 'in this room!'

'they're all over the place,' said julia indifferently as she lay down
again. 'we've even got them in the kitchen at the hostel. some parts of
london are swarming with them. did you know they attack children? yes,
they do. in some of these streets a woman daren't leave a baby alone for
two minutes. it's the great huge brown ones that do it. and the nasty
thing is that the brutes always----'

'don't go on!' said winston, with his eyes tightly shut.

sick?'

ch the same. he was standing in front of a wall of darkness,
and on the other side of it there was something unendurable, something too
dreadful to be faced. in the dream his deepest feeling was always one of
self-deception, because he did in fact know what was behind the wall of
darkness. with a deadly effort, like wrenching a piece out of his own
brain, he could even have dragged the thing into the open. he always woke
up without discovering what it was: but somehow it was connected with what
julia had been saying when he cut her short.

'i'm sorry,' he said, 'it's nothing. i don't like rats, that's all.'

'don't worry, dear, we're not going to have the filthy brutes in here.
i'll stuff the hole with a bit of sacking before we go. and next time we
come here i'll bring some plaster and bung it up properly.'

already the black instant of panic was half-forgotten. feeling slightly
ashamed of himself, he sat up against the bedhead. julia got out of bed,

saucepan was so powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest
anybody outside should notice it and become inquisitive. what was even
better than the taste of the coffee was the silky texture given to it by
the sugar, a thing winston had almost forgotten after years of saccharine.
with one hand in her pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the other,
julia wandered about the room, glancing indifferently at the bookcase,
pointing out the best way of repairing the gateleg table, plumping herself
down in the ragged arm-chair to see if it was comfortable, and examining
the absurd twelve-hour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement. she brought
the glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in a better
light. he took it out of her hand, fascinated, as always, by the soft,
rainwatery appearance of the glass.

one knew how to read it.'

'and that picture over there'--she nodded at the engraving on the opposite
wall--'would that be a hundred years old?'

'more. two hundred, i dare say. one can't tell. it's impossible to discover
the age of anything nowadays.'

lemon was,' she added inconsequently. 'i've seen oranges. they're a kind
of round yellow fruit with a thick skin.'

'i can remember lemons,' said winston. 'they were quite common in the
fifties. they were so sour that it set your teeth on edge even to smell
them.'

'i bet that picture's got bugs behind it,' said julia. 'i'll take it down
and give it a good clean some day. i suppose it's almost time we were
leaving. i must start washing this paint off. what a bore! i'll get the
lipstick off your face afterwards.'

winston did not get up for a few minutes more. the room was darkening. he
turned over towards the light and lay gazing into the glass paperweight.
the inexhaustibly interesting thing was not the fragment of coral but the
interior of the glass itself. there was such a depth of it, and yet it was

had been the arch of the sky, enclosing a tiny world with its atmosphere
complete. he had the feeling that he could get inside it, and that in
fact he was inside it, along with the mahogany bed and the gateleg table,
and the clock and the steel engraving and the paperweight itself. the
paperweight was the room he was in, and the coral was julia's life and his
own, fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal.

syme had vanished. a morning came, and he was missing from work: a few
thoughtless people commented on his absence. on the next day nobody
mentioned him. on the third day winston went into the vestibule of the

a printed list of the members of the chess committee, of whom syme had
been one. it looked almost exactly as it had look

ned rooms kept their normal temperature, but outside the
pavements scorched one's feet and the stench of the tubes at the rush hours
was a horror. the preparations for hate week were in full swing, and the
staffs of all the ministries were working overtime. processions, meetings,
military parades, lectures, waxworks, displays, film shows, telescreen
programmes all had to be organized; stands had to be erected, effigies
built, slogans coined, songs written, rumours circulated, photographs
faked. julia's unit in the fiction department had been taken off the
production of novels and was rushing out a series of atrocity pamphlets.
winston, in addition to his regular work, spent long periods every day in
going through back files of 'the times' and altering and embellishing news
items which were to be quoted in speeches. late at night, when crowds of
rowdy proles roamed the streets, the town had a curiously febrile air. the
rocket bombs crashed oftener than ever, and sometimes in the far distance

poster of the eurasian soldier were torn down and added to the flames, and
a number of shops were looted in the turmoil; then a rumour flew round
that spies were directing the rocket bombs by means of wireless waves, and
an old couple who were suspected of being of foreign extraction had their
house set on fire and perished of suffocation.

in the room over mr charrington's shop, when they could get there, julia
and winston lay side by side on a stripped bed under the open window,
naked for the sake of coolness. the rat had never come back, but the bugs
had multiplied hideously in the heat. it did not seem to matter. dirty or
clean, the room was paradise. as soon as they arrived they would sprinkle
everything with pepper bought on the black market, tear off their clothes,
and make love with sweating bodies, then fall asleep and wake to find that

ficult and dangerous, but the room itself was sanctuary. it was as when
winston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight, with the feeling that
it would be possible to get inside that glassy world, and that once inside
it time could be arrested. often they gave themselves up to daydreams of
escape. their luck would hold indefinitely, and they would carry on their
intrigue, just like this, for the remainder of their natural lives. or
katharine would die, and by subtle manoeuvrings winston and julia would
succeed in getting married. or they would commit suicide together. or
they would disappear, alter themselves out of recognition, learn to speak
with proletarian accents, get jobs in a factory and live out their lives
undetected in a back-street. it was all nonsense, as they both knew. in
reality there was no escape. even the one plan that was practicable,
suicide, they had no intention of carrying out. to hang on from day to day
and from week to week, spinning out a present that had no fu

. but she only questioned the teachings of the party when they
in some way touched upon her own life. often she was ready to accept
the official mythology, simply because the difference between truth and
falsehood did not seem important to her. she believed, for instance, having
learnt it at school, that the party had invented aeroplanes. (in his own
schooldays, winston remembered, in the late fifties, it was only the
helicopter that the party claimed to have invented; a dozen years later,
when julia was at school, it was already claiming the aeroplane; one
generation more, and it would be claiming the steam engine.) and when he

before the revolution, the fact struck her as totally uninteresting. after
all, what did it matter who had invented aeroplanes? it was rather more
of a shock to him when he discovered from some chance remark that she did
not remember that oceania, four years ago, had been at war with eastasia

'it was no good, because i threw it away a few minutes later. but if the

'not much, perhaps. but it was evidence. it might have planted a few doubts

it had happened at last. the expected message had come. all his life, it
seemed to him, he had been waiting for this to happen.

he was walking down the long corridor at the ministry and he was almost
at the spot where julia had slipped the note into his hand when he became
aware that someone larger than himself was walking just behind him. the
person, whoever it was, gave a small cough, evidently as a prelude to
speaking. winston stopped abruptly and turned. it was o'brien.

at last they were face to face, and it seemed that his only impulse was
to run away. his heart bounded violently. he would have been incapable of
speaking. o'brien, however, had continued forward in the same movement,
laying a friendly hand fo

n the beginning. but it was frightening: or, more exactly, it was like
a foretaste of death, like being a little less alive. even while he was
speaking to o'brien, when the meaning of the words had sunk in, a chilly
shuddering feeling had taken possession of his body. he had the sensation
of stepping into the dampness of a grave, and it was not much better
because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for him.




chapter 7



winston had woken up with his eyes full of tears. julia rolled sleepily
against him, murmuring something that might have been 'what's the matter?'

'i dreamt--' he began, and stopped short. it was too complex to be put
into words. there was the dream itself, and there was a memory connected
with it that had swum into his mind in the few seconds after waking.

he lay back with his eyes shut, still sodden in the atmosphere of the
dream. it was a vast, luminous dream in which his whole life seemed to
stretch out before him like a landscape on a summer

with clear soft light in which one could see into interminable distances.
the dream had also been comprehended by--indeed, in some sense it had
consisted in--a gesture of the arm made by his mother, and made again
thirty years later by the jewish woman he had seen on the news film,
trying to shelter the small boy from the bullets, before the helicopter
blew them both to pieces.

'do you know,' he said, 'that until this moment i believed i had murdered
my mother?'

'why did you murder her?' said julia, almost asleep.

'i didn't murder her. not physically.'

in the dream he had remembered his last glimpse of his mother, and within
a few moments of waking the cluster of small events surrounding it had all
come back. it was a memory that he must have deliberately pushed out of
his consciousness over many years. he was not certain of the date, but he
could not have been less than ten years old, possibly twelve, when it had
happened.

his father had disappeared some time earlier, how much earlier

other, or simply left somewhere or other
to die.

the dream was still vivid in his mind, especially the enveloping protecting
gesture of the arm in which its whole meaning seemed to be contained. his
mind went back to another dream of two months ago. exactly as his mother
had sat on the dingy white-quilted bed, with the child clinging to her, so
she had sat in the sunken ship, far underneath him, and drowning deeper
every minute, but still looking up at him through the darkening water.

he told julia the story of his mother's disappearance. without opening her
eyes she rolled over and settled herself into a more comfortable position.

'i expect you were a beastly little swine in those days,' she said
indistinctly. 'all children are swine.'

'yes. but the real point of the story----'

from her breathing it was evident that she was going off to sleep again.
he would have liked to continue talking about his mother. he did not

e day spring to life and regenerate the world. the proles had stayed
human. they had not become hardened inside. they had held on to the
primitive emotions which he himself had to re-learn by conscious effort.
and in thinking this he remembered, without apparent relevance, how a few
weeks ago he had seen a severed hand lying on the pavement and had kicked
it into the gutter as though it had been a cabbage-stalk.

'the proles are human beings,' he said aloud. 'we are not human.'

'why not?' said julia, who had woken up again.

he thought for a little while. 'has it ever occurred to you,' he said,
'that the best thing for us to do would be simply to walk out of here
before it's too late, and never see each other again?'

'yes, dear, it has occurred to me, several times. but i'm not going to do
it, all the same.'

they had done it, they had done it at last!

the room they were standing in was long-shaped and softly lit. the
telescreen was dimmed to a low murmur; the richness of the dark-blue carpet
gave one the impression of treading on velvet. at the far end of the room
o'brien was sitting at a table under a green-shaded lamp, with a mass of
papers on either side of him. he had not bothered to look up when the
servant showed julia and winston in.

winston's heart was thumping so hard that he doubted whether he would be
able to speak. they had done it, they had done it at last, was all he
could think. it had been a rash act to come here at all, and sheer folly
to arrive together; though it was true that they had come by different
routes and only met on o'brien's doorstep. but merely to walk into such a
place needed an effort of the nerve. it was only on very rare occasions
that one saw inside the dwelling-places of the in
 
 ___________________________
 
the terror that
winston already felt was suddenly shot through by a streak of ordinary
embarrassment. it seemed to him quite possible that he had simply made a
stupid mistake. for what evidence had he in reality that o'brien was any
kind of political conspirator? nothing but a flash of the eyes and a single
equivocal remark: beyond that, only his own secret imaginings, founded on
a dream. he could not even fall back on the pretence that he had come to
borrow the dictionary, because in that case julia's presence was impossible
to explain. as o'brien passed the telescreen a thought seemed to strike
him. he stopped, turned aside and pressed a switch on the wall. there was
a sharp snap. the voice had stopped.

julia uttered a tiny sound, a sort of squeak of surprise. even in the midst
of his panic, winston was too much taken aback to be able to hold his
tongue.

'you can turn it off!' he said.

'yes,' said o'brien, 'we can turn it off. we have that privilege.'

he was opposite them now. his sol

and that he felt it to be dangerous to
drop his assumed personality even for a moment. o'brien took the decanter
by the neck and filled up the glasses with a dark-red liquid. it aroused
in winston dim memories of something seen long ago on a wall or a
hoarding--a vast bottle composed of electric lights which seemed to move
up and down and pour its contents into a glass. seen from the top the
stuff looked almost black, but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby.
it had a sour-sweet smell. he saw julia pick up her glass and sniff at
it with frank curiosity.

'it is called wine,' said o'brien with a faint smile. 'you will have read
about it in books, no doubt. not much of it gets to the outer party, i am
afraid.' his face grew solemn again, and he raised his glass: 'i think it
is fitting that we should begin by drinking a health. to our leader: to
emmanuel goldstein.'

winston took up his glass with a certain eagerness. wine was a thing he
had read and dreamed about. like the glass paperweight

 it real? it is not simply an
invention of the thought police?'

'no, it is real. the brotherhood, we call it. you will never learn much
more about the brotherhood than that it exists and that you belong to it.
i will come back to that presently.' he looked at his wrist-watch. 'it is
unwise even for members of the inner party to turn off the telescreen for
more than half an hour. you ought not to have come here together, and
you will have to leave separately. you, comrade'--he bowed his head to
julia--'will leave first. we have about twenty minutes at our disposal.
you will understand that i must start by asking you certain questions.
in general terms, what are you prepared to do?'

'anything that we are capable of,' said winston.

o'brien had turned himself a little in his chair so that he was facing
winston. he almost ignored julia, seeming to take it for granted that
winston could speak for her. for a moment the lids flitted down over his
eyes. he began asking his questions in a low, exp

to cause
demoralization and weaken the power of the party?'

'yes.'

'if, for example, it would somehow serve our interests to throw sulphuric
acid in a child's face--are you prepared to do that?'

'yes.'

'you are prepared to lose your identity and live out the rest of your life
as a waiter or a dock-worker?'

'yes.'

'you are prepared to commit suicide, if and when we order you to do so?'

'yes.'

'you are prepared, the two of you, to separate and never see one another
again?'

'no!' broke in julia.

it appeared to winston that a long time passed before he answered. for a
moment he seemed even to have been deprived of the power of speech. his
tongue worked soundlessly, forming the opening syllables first of one word,
then of the other, over and over again. until he had said it, he did not
know which word he was going to say. 'no,' he said finally.

'you did well to tell me,' said o'brien. 'it is necessary for us to know
everything.'

he turned himself toward julia and added in a voice wit

ven if he survives, it may be as a different
person? we may be obliged to give him a new identity. his face, his
movements, the shape of his hands, the colour of his hair--even his voice

our surgeons can alter people beyond recognition. sometimes it is
necessary. sometimes we even amputate a limb.'

winston could not help snatching another sidelong glance at martin's
mongolian face. there were no scars that he could see. julia had turned a
shade paler, so that her freckles were showing, but she faced o'brien
boldly. she murmured something that seemed to be assent.

'good. then that is settled.'

there was a silver box of cigarettes on the table. with a rather
absent-minded air o'brien pushed them towards the others, took one himself,
then stood up and began to pace slowly to and fro, as though he could think
better standing. they were very good cigarettes, very thick and
well-packed, with an unfamiliar silkiness in t

to do, unflinchingly. but this is not what we shall be doing when life is
worth living again.' a wave of admiration, almost of worship, flowed out
from winston towards o'brien. for the moment he had forgotten the shadowy
figure of goldstein. when you looked at o'brien's powerful shoulders and
his blunt-featured face, so ugly and yet so civilized, it was impossible
to believe that he could be defeated. there was no stratagem that he was
not equal to, no danger that he could not foresee. even julia seemed to
be impressed. she had let her cigarette go out and was listening intently.
o'brien went on:

'you will have heard rumours of the existence of the brotherhood. no doubt
you have formed your own picture of it. you have imagined, probably, a
huge underworld of conspirators, meeting secretly in cellars, scribbling
messages on walls, recognizing one another by codewords or by special
movements of the hand. nothing of the kind exists. the members of the
brotherhood have no way of recognizin

splinters of bone. but how far away that future may be, there
is no knowing. it might be a thousand years. at present nothing is possible
except to extend the area of sanity little by little. we cannot act
collectively. we can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to
individual, generation after generation. in the face of the thought police
there is no other way.'

he halted and looked for the third time at his wrist-watch.

'it is almost time for you to leave, comrade,' he said to julia. 'wait.
the decanter is still half full.'

he filled the glasses and raised his own glass by the stem.

'what shall it be this time?' he said, still with the same faint
suggestion of irony. 'to the confusion of the thought police? to the
death of big brother? to humanity? to the future?'

'to the past,' said winston.

'the past is more important,' agreed o'brien gravely.

they emptied their glasses, and a moment later julia stood up to go.
o'brien took a small box from the top of a cabinet and

ow morning. winston, still carrying the brief-case containing the
book, which had remained between his feet while he worked and under his
body while he slept, went home, shaved himself, and almost fell asleep in
his bath, although the water was barely more than tepid.

with a sort of voluptuous creaking in his joints he climbed the stair above
mr charrington's shop. he was tired, but not sleepy any longer. he opened
the window, lit the dirty little oilstove and put on a pan of water for
coffee. julia would arrive presently: meanwhile there was the book. he
sat down in the sluttish armchair and undid the straps of the brief-case.

a heavy black volume, amateurishly bound, with no name or title on the
cover. the print also looked slightly irregular. the pages were worn at
the edges, and fell apart, easily, as though the book had passed through
many hands. the inscription on the title-page ran:

 his cheek. the book fascinated him, or more
exactly it reassured him. in a sense it told him nothing that was new, but
that was part of the attraction. it said what he would have said, if it
had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order. it was
the product of a mind similar to his own, but enormously more powerful,
more systematic, less fear-ridden. the best books, he perceived, are those
that tell you what you know already. he had just turned back to chapter i
when he heard julia's footstep on the stair and started out of his chair
to meet her. she dumped her brown tool-bag on the floor and flung herself
into his arms. it was more than a week since they had seen one another.

'i've got the book,' he said as they disentangled themselves.

'oh, you've got it? good,' she said without much interest, and almost
immediately knelt down beside the oil stove to make the coffee.

they did not return to the subject until they had been in bed for half an
hour. the evening was just

cool enough to make it worth while to pull up
the counterpane. from below came the familiar sound of singing and the
scrape of boots on the flagstones. the brawny red-armed woman whom winston
had seen there on his first visit was almost a fixture in the yard. there
seemed to be no hour of daylight when she was not marching to and fro
between the washtub and the line, alternately gagging herself with clothes
pegs and breaking forth into lusty song. julia had settled down on her
side and seemed to be already on the point of falling asleep. he reached
out for the book, which was lying on the floor, and sat up against the
bedhead.

'we must read it,' he said. 'you too. all members of the brotherhood have
to read it.'

'you read it,' she said with her eyes shut. 'read it aloud. that's the
best way. then you can explain it to me as you go.'

the clock's hands said six, meaning eighteen. they had three or four hours
ahead of them. he propped the book

ld, the high, the middle,
and the low. they have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne
countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their
attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the
essential structure of society has never altered. even after enormous
upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always
reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium,

'julia, are you awake?' said winston.

'yes, my love, i'm listening. go on. it's marvellous.'

he continued reading:


the aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable. the aim of
the high is to remain where they are. the aim of the middle is to change
places with the high. the aim of the low, when they have an aim--for it
is an abiding characteristic of the low that they are too much crushed
by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside
their daily lives--is to ab

party, and above all of the inner party, depends upon doublethink but
deeper than this lies the original motive, the never-questioned instinct
that first led to the seizure of power and brought doublethink, the
thought police, continuous warfare, and all the other necessary
paraphernalia into existence afterwards. this motive really consists...


winston became aware of silence, as one becomes aware of a new sound. it
seemed to him that julia had been very still for some time past. she was
lying on her side, naked from the waist upwards, with her cheek pillowed
on her hand and one dark lock tumbling across her eyes. her breast rose
and fell slowly and regularly.

'julia.'

no answer.

'julia, are you awake?'

no answer. she was asleep. he shut the book, put it carefully on the floor,
lay down, and pulled the coverlet over both of them.

he had still, he reflected, not learned the ultimate secret. he understood
how; he did not unders

 sensation of having slept for a long time,
but a glance at the old-fashioned clock told him that it was only
twenty-thirty. he lay dozing for a while; then the usual deep-lunged
singing struck up from the yard below:


  'it was only an 'opeless fancy,
  it passed like an ipril dye,
  but a look an' a word an' the dreams they stirred
  they 'ave stolen my 'eart awye!'


the drivelling song seemed to have kept its popularity. you still heard it
all over the place. it had outlived the hate song. julia woke at the
sound, stretched herself luxuriously, and got out of bed.

'i'm hungry,' she said. 'let's make some more coffee. damn! the stove's
gone out and the water's cold.' she picked the stove up and shook it.
'there's no oil in it.'

'we can get some from old charrington, i expect.'

'the funny thing is i made sure it was full. i'm going to put my clothes
on,' she added. 'it seems to have got colder.'

winston also got up and dressed himself. the indefatigable voice sang on:


  'they sye t

nd the houses; it was not shining into the
yard any longer. the flagstones were wet as though they had just been
washed, and he had the feeling that the sky had been washed too, so fresh
and pale was the blue between the chimney-pots. tirelessly the woman
marched to and fro, corking and uncorking herself, singing and falling
silent, and pegging out more diapers, and more and yet more. he wondered
whether she took in washing for a living or was merely the slave of twenty
or thirty grandchildren. julia had come across to his side; together they
gazed down with a sort of fascination at the sturdy figure below. as he
looked at the woman in her characteristic attitude, her thick arms reaching
up for the line, her powerful mare-like buttocks protruded, it struck him
for the first time that she was beautiful. it had never before occurred to
him that the body of a woman of fifty, blown up to monstrous dimensions by
childbearing, then hardened, roughened by work till it was coarse in the
grain like 
 
 ___________________________
 
an over-ripe turnip, could be beautiful. but it was so, and
after all, he thought, why not? the solid, contourless body, like a block
of granite, and the rasping red skin, bore the same relation to the body
of a girl as the rose-hip to the rose. why should the fruit be held
inferior to the flower?

'she's beautiful,' he murmured.

'she's a metre across the hips, easily,' said julia.

'that is her style of beauty,' said winston.

he held julia's supple waist easily encircled by his arm. from the hip to
the knee her flank was against his. out of their bodies no child would
ever come. that was the one thing they could never do. only by word of
mouth, from mind to mind, could they pass on the secret. the woman down
there had no mind, she had only strong arms, a warm heart, and a fertile
belly. he wondered how many children she had given birth to. it might
easily be fifteen. she had had her momentary flowering, a year, perhaps,

o consciousness. the proles were immortal, you could not
doubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard. in the end
their awakening would come. and until that happened, though it might be a
thousand years, they would stay alive against all the odds, like birds,
passing on from body to body the vitality which the party did not share
and could not kill.

'do you remember,' he said, 'the thrush that sang to us, that first day,
at the edge of the wood?'

'he wasn't singing to us,' said julia. 'he was singing to please himself.
not even that. he was just singing.'

the birds sang, the proles sang. the party did not sing. all round the
world, in london and new york, in africa and brazil, and in the mysterious,
forbidden lands beyond the frontiers, in the streets of paris and berlin,
in the villages of the endless russian plain, in the bazaars of china and
japan--everywhere stood the same solid unconquerable figure, made monstrous
by work and childbearing, toiling from birth to death

and still singing.
out of those mighty loins a race of conscious beings must one day come.
you were the dead, theirs was the future. but you could share in that
future if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive the body, and passed
on the secret doctrine that two plus two make four.

'we are the dead,' he said.

'we are the dead,' echoed julia dutifully.

'you are the dead,' said an iron voice behind them.

they sprang apart. winston's entrails seemed to have turned into ice. he
could see the white all round the irises of julia's eyes. her face had
turned a milky yellow. the smear of rouge that was still on each cheekbone
stood out sharply, almost as though unconnected with the skin beneath.

'you are the dead,' repeated the iron voice.

'it was behind the picture,' breathed julia.

'it was behind the picture,' said the voice. 'remai

it was starting, it was starting at last! they could do nothing except
stand gazing into one another's eyes. to run for life, to get out of the
house before it was too late--no such thought occurred to them. unthinkable
to disobey the iron voice from the wall. there was a snap as though a catch
had been turned back, and a crash of breaking glass. the picture had fallen
to the floor uncovering the telescreen behind it.

'now they can see us,' said julia.

'now we can see you,' said the voice. 'stand out in the middle of the
room. stand back to back. clasp your hands behind your heads. do not touch
one another.'

they were not touching, but it seemed to him that he could feel julia's
body shaking. or perhaps it was merely the shaking of his own. he could
just stop his teeth from chattering, but his knees were beyond his control.
there was a sound of trampling boots below, inside the house and outside.
the yard seemed to be full of men. somethin

g was being dragged across the
stones. the woman's singing had stopped abruptly. there was a long, rolling
clang, as though the washtub had been flung across the yard, and then a
confusion of angry shouts which ended in a yell of pain.

'the house is surrounded,' said winston.

'the house is surrounded,' said the voice.

he heard julia snap her teeth together. 'i suppose we may as well say
good-bye,' she said.

'you may as well say good-bye,' said the voice. and then another quite
different voice, a thin, cultivated voice which winston had the impression
of having heard before, struck in; 'and by the way, while we are on the
subject, "here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to
chop off your head"!'

something crashed on to the bed behind winston's back. the head of a ladder
had been thrust through the wi

his lips should have been, and
then passed on. there was another crash. someone had picked up the glass
paperweight from the table and smashed it to pieces on the hearth-stone.

the fragment of coral, a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar rosebud from
a cake, rolled across the mat. how small, thought winston, how small it
always was! there was a gasp and a thump behind him, and he received a
violent kick on the ankle which nearly flung him off his balance. one of
the men had smashed his fist into julia's solar plexus, doubling her up
like a pocket ruler. she was thrashing about on the floor, fighting for
breath. winston dared not turn his head even by a millimetre, but sometimes
her livid, gasping face came within the angle of his vision. even in his
terror it was as though he could feel the pain in his own body, the deadly
pain which nevertheless was less urgent than the struggle to get back her
breath. he knew what it was like; the terrible, agonizing pain which was
there all the while but

otally uninteresting began to flit through his
mind. he wondered whether they had got mr charrington. he wondered what
they had done to the woman in the yard. he noticed that he badly wanted
to urinate, and felt a faint surprise, because he had done so only two or
three hours ago. he noticed that the clock on the mantelpiece said nine,
meaning twenty-one. but the light seemed too strong. would not the light
be fading at twenty-one hours on an august evening? he wondered whether
after all he and julia had mistaken the time--had slept the clock round
and thought it was twenty-thirty when really it was nought eight-thirty
on the following morning. but he did not pursue the thought further.
it was not interesting.

there was another, lighter step in the passage. mr charrington came into
the room. the demeanour of the black-uniformed men suddenly became more
subdued. something had also changed in mr charrington's appearance. his
eye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweight.

 his thoughts expanded or contracted accordingly. when
it grew worse he thought only of the pain itself, and of his desire for
food. when it grew better, panic took hold of him. there were moments
when he foresaw the things that would happen to him with such actuality
that his heart galloped and his breath stopped. he felt the smash of
truncheons on his elbows and iron-shod boots on his shins; he saw himself
grovelling on the floor, screaming for mercy through broken teeth. he
hardly thought of julia. he could not fix his mind on her. he loved her
and would not betray her; but that was only a fact, known as he knew the
rules of arithmetic. he felt no love for her, and he hardly even wondered
what was happening to her. he thought oftener of o'brien, with a flickering
hope. o'brien might know that he had been arrested. the brotherhood, he
had said, never tried to save its members. but there was the razor blade;
they would send the razor blade if they could. there would be perhaps five

into the cell. with
a brief movement of the hand he indicated ampleforth.

'room 101,' he said.

ampleforth marched clumsily out between the guards, his face vaguely
perturbed, but uncomprehending.

what seemed like a long time passed. the pain in winston's belly had
revived. his mind sagged round and round on the same trick, like a ball
falling again and again into the same series of slots. he had only six
thoughts. the pain in his belly; a piece of bread; the blood and the
screaming; o'brien; julia; the razor blade. there was another spasm in his
entrails, the heavy boots were approaching. as the door opened, the wave
of air that it created brought in a powerful smell of cold sweat. parsons
walked into the cell. he was wearing khaki shorts and a sports-shirt.

this time winston was startled into self-forgetfulness.

'you here!' he said.

parsons gave winston a glance in which there was neither interest nor
surprise, but only misery. he began walking jerkily up and down, evidently
unable t

 of faintness, an empty feeling inside his head. he would get up
because the ache in his bones was no longer bearable, and then would sit
down again almost at once because he was too dizzy to make sure of
staying on his feet. whenever his physical sensations were a little under
control the terror returned. sometimes with a fading hope he thought of

arrive concealed in his food, if he were ever fed. more dimly he thought
of julia. somewhere or other she was suffering perhaps far worse than he.
she might be screaming with pain at this moment. he thought: 'if i could
save julia by doubling my own pain, would i do it? yes, i would.' but that
was merely an intellectual decision, taken because he knew that he ought
to take it. he did not feel it. in this place you could not feel anything,
except pain and foreknowledge of pain. besides, was it possible, when you
were actually suffering it, to wish for any reason that your own

either; he was looking only at the dials.

he was rolling down a mighty corridor, a kilometre wide, full of glorious,
golden light, roaring with laughter and shouting out confessions at the
top of his voice. he was confessing everything, even the things he had
succeeded in holding back under the torture. he was relating the entire
history of his life to an audience who knew it already. with him were the
guards, the other questioners, the men in white coats, o'brien, julia,
mr charrington, all rolling down the corridor together and shouting with
laughter. some dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the future had
somehow been skipped over and had not happened. everything was all right,
there was no more pain, the last detail of his life was laid bare,
understood, forgiven.

he was starting up from the plank bed in the half-certainty that he had
heard o'brien's voice. all through his interrogation, although he had
never seen him, he had had the feeling that o'b

whether i was a friend or an enemy, since i was at least a person who

you. your mind appeals to me. it resembles my own mind except that you
happen to be insane. before we bring the session to an end you can ask me
a few questions, if you choose.'

'any question i like?'

'anything.' he saw that winston's eyes were upon the dial. 'it is switched
off. what is your first question?'

'what have you done with julia?' said winston.

o'brien smiled again. 'she betrayed you, winston. immediately--unreservedly.
i have seldom seen anyone come over to us so promptly. you would hardly
recognize her if you saw her. all her rebelliousness, her deceit, her
folly, her dirty-mindedness--everything has been burned out of her. it was
a perfect conversion, a textbook case.'

'you tortured her?'

o'brien left this unanswered. 'next question,' he said.

'does big brother exist?'

'of course he exists. the party exists. bi

 is like. your mind is in the same state. i do not think there
can be much pride left in you. you have been kicked and flogged and
insulted, you have screamed with pain, you have rolled on the floor in
your own blood and vomit. you have whimpered for mercy, you have betrayed
everybody and everything. can you think of a single degradation that has
not happened to you?'

winston had stopped weeping, though the tears were still oozing out of his
eyes. he looked up at o'brien.

'i have not betrayed julia,' he said.

o'brien looked down at him thoughtfully. 'no,' he said; 'no; that is
perfectly true. you have not betrayed julia.'

the peculiar reverence for o'brien, which nothing seemed able to destroy,
flooded winston's heart again. how intelligent, he thought, how
intelligent! never did o'brien fail to understand what was said to him.
anyone else on earth would have answered promptly that he had betrayed
julia. for what was there that they had not screwed out of him under the
torture? he had t

d lie from one meal to the next almost
without stirring, sometimes asleep, sometimes waking into vague reveries
in which it was too much trouble to open his eyes. he had long grown
used to sleeping with a strong light on his face. it seemed to make no
difference, except that one's dreams were more coherent. he dreamed a
great deal all through this time, and they were always happy dreams. he
was in the golden country, or he was sitting among enormous glorious,
sunlit ruins, with his mother, with julia, with o'brien--not doing
anything, merely sitting in the sun, talking of peaceful things. such
thoughts as he had when he was awake were mostly about his dreams. he
seemed to have lost the power of intellectual effort, now that the
stimulus of pain had been removed. he was not bored, he had no desire
for conversation or distraction. merely to be alone, not to be beaten
or questioned, to have enough to eat, and to be clean all over, was
completely satisfying.

by degrees he came to spend less ti

had looked back at him out of the mirror.

his mind grew more active. he sat down on the plank bed, his back against
the wall and the slate on his knees, and set to work deliberately at the
task of re-educating himself.

he had capitulated, that was agreed. in reality, as he saw now, he had
been ready to capitulate long before he had taken the decision. from the
moment when he was inside the ministry of love--and yes, even during those
minutes when he and julia had stood helpless while the iron voice from the
telescreen told them what to do--he had grasped the frivolity, the
shallowness of his attempt to set himself up against the power of the
party. he knew now that for seven years the thought police had watched him
like a beetle under a magnifying glass. there was no physical act, no word
spoken aloud, that they had not noticed, no train of thought that they had
not been able to infer. even the speck of whitish dust on the cover of his
diary they ha

d carefully replaced. they had played sound-tracks to him,
shown him photographs. some of them were photographs of julia and himself.
yes, even... he could not fight against the party any longer. besides,
the party was in the right. it must be so; how could the immortal,
collective brain be mistaken? by what external standard could you check
its judgements? sanity was statistical. it was merely a question of
learning to think as they thought. only----!

the pencil felt thick and awkward in his fingers. he began to write down
the thoughts that came into his head. he wrote first in large clumsy
capitals:

lk in the delirium induced by drugs. he was in the golden
country, following the foot-track across the old rabbit-cropped pasture.
he could feel the short springy turf under his feet and the gentle sunshine
on his face. at the edge of the field were the elm trees, faintly stirring,
and somewhere beyond that was the stream where the dace lay in the green
pools under the willows.

suddenly he started up with a shock of horror. the sweat broke out on his
backbone. he had heard himself cry aloud:

'julia! julia! julia, my love! julia!'

for a moment he had had an overwhelming hallucination of her presence. she
had seemed to be not merely with him, but inside him. it was as though she
had got into the texture of his skin. in that moment he had loved her far
more than he had ever done when they were together and free. also he knew
that somewhere or other she was still alive and needed his help.

he lay back on the bed and tried to compose himself. what had he done? how

 mindless.

'it was a common punishment in imperial china,' said o'brien as
didactically as ever.

the mask was closing on his face. the wire brushed his cheek. and then--no,
it was not relief, only hope, a tiny fragment of hope. too late, perhaps
too late. but he had suddenly understood that in the whole world there was
just one person to whom he could transfer his punishment--one body that he
could thrust between himself and the rats. and he was shouting frantically,
over and over.

'do it to julia! do it to julia! not me! julia! i don't care what you do
to her. tear her face off, strip her to the bones. not me! julia! not me!'

he was falling backwards, into enormous depths, away from the rats. he was
still strapped in the chair, but he had fallen through the floor, through
the walls of the building, through the earth, through the oceans, through
the atmosphere, into outer space, into the gulfs between the stars--always
away, away, away from the rats. he was light years distant, but o'br

ain,' he said.

'yes,' she said, 'we must meet again.'

he followed irresolutely for a little distance, half a pace behind her.
they did not speak again. she did not actually try to shake him off, but
walked at just such a speed as to prevent his keeping abreast of her.
he had made up his mind that he would accompany her as far as the tube
station, but suddenly this process of trailing along in the cold seemed
pointless and unbearable. he was overwhelmed by a desire not so much to
get away from julia as to get back to the chestnut tree cafe, which had
never seemed so attractive as at this moment. he had a nostalgic vision
of his corner table, with the newspaper and the chessboard and the
ever-flowing gin. above all, it would be warm in there. the next moment,
not altogether by accident, he allowed himself to become separated from
her by a small knot of people. he made a half-hearted attempt to catch up,
then slowed down, turned, and made off in the opposite direction. when he
