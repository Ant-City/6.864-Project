Clytemnestra - 
      Clytemnestra is the Queen of Argos. Formerly married to Agamemnon, whom she murdered, she now reigns corruptly alongside Aegisthus, her paramour. She despises and poorly treats her daughter, Electra, whose constant mourning and desire for revenge threatens Clytemnestra. She loves wealth and well being, both of which she enjoys, but she is clearly haunted by her past actions and aware that her current happiness rests on uneasy ground.
