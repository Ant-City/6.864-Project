he turned into side streets leading to the east river. a lonely traffic light hung far ahead, a 
spot of red in a bleak darkness. the old houses crouched low to the ground, hunched under 
the weight of the sky. the street was empty and hollow, echoing to his footsteps. he went on, 
his collar raised, his hands in his pockets. his shadow rose from under his heels, when he 
passed a light, and brushed a wall in a long black arc, like the sweep of a windshield wiper.

john erik snyte looked through roark's sketches, flipped three of them aside, gathered 
the rest into an even pile, glanced again at the three, tossed them down one after another on 
top of the pile, with three sharp thuds, and said:

"remarkable. radical, but remarkable. what are you doing tonight?"

"why?" asked roark, stupefied.

"are you free? mind starting in at once? take your coat off, go to the drafting room, borrow 
tools from somebody and do me up a sketch for a department store we're remodeling. jus

"fine! splendid! that's just what i've always needed--a cameron man. i've got every other 
kind. oh, yes, what did they pay you at francon's?"

"sixty-five."

"well, i can't splurge like guy the epicure. fifty's tops. okay? fine. go right in. i'll have 
billings explain about the store to you. i want something modern. understand? modern, 
violent, crazy, to knock their eye out. don't restrain yourself. go the limit. pull any stunt you 
can think of, the goofier the better. come on!"

john erik snyte shot to his feet, flung a door open into a huge drafting room, flew in, skidded 
against a table, stopped, and said to a stout man with a grim moon-face: "billings--roark. he's 
our modernist. give him the benton store. get him some instruments. leave him your keys 
and show him what to lock up tonight. start him as of this morning. fifty. what time was my 
appointment with dolson brothers? i'm late already. so long, i won't be back tonight."

he skidded out, slamming the door. billings evinced

he smooth shaft; he saw that the pencil was trembling. he put it down quickly, and he felt 
anger at himself for the weakness of allowing this job to mean so much to him, for the sudden 
knowledge of what the months of idleness behind him had really meant. his fingertips were 
pressed to the paper, as if the paper held them, as a surface charged with electricity will hold 
the flesh of a man who has brushed against it, hold and hurt. he tore his fingers off the paper. 
then he went to work....

john erik snyte was fifty years old; he wore an expression of quizzical amusement, shrewd 
and unwholesome, as if he shared with each man he contemplated a lewd secret which he 
would not mention because it was so obvious to them both. he was a prominent architect; his 
expression did not change when he spoke of this fact. he considered guy francon an 
impractical idealist; he was not restrained by an classic dogma; he was much more skillful 
and liberal: he built anything. he had no distaste for modern archit

ot been afraid to hire him. he recognized his own planes of space, his windows, his 
system of circulation; he saw, added to it, corinthian capitals, gothic vaulting, colonial 
chandeliers and incredible moldings, vaguely moorish. the drawing was done in water-color, 
with miraculous delicacy, mounted on cardboard, covered with a veil of tissue paper. the men 
in the drafting room were not allowed to look at it, except from a safe distance; all hands had 
to be washed, all cigarettes discarded. john erik snyte attached a great importance to the 
proper appearance of a drawing for submission to clients, and kept a young chinese student 
of architecture employed solely upon the execution of these masterpieces.

roark knew what to expect of his job. he would never see his work erected, only pieces of it, 
which he preferred not to see; but he would be free to design as he wished and he would have 
the experience of solving actual problems. it was less than he wanted and more than he could 
expect. he ac

"well," said keating, throwing one hand up in a careless gesture, "i'm not afraid very often."

then he leaned back against the cushions, as if he were tired, as if he had heard nothing of 
importance, and he kept silent for the rest of the drive. francon kept silent also.

"boys," said john erik snyte, "don't spare yourselves on this. it's the most important thing 
we've had this year. not much money, you understand, but the prestige, the connections! if 
we do land it, won't some of those great architects turn green! you see, austen heller has told 
me frankly that we're the third firm he's approached. he would have none of what those big 
fellows tried to sell him. so it's up to us, boys. you know, something different, unusual, but in

up into one consummate 
harmony. the walls, of the same granite as the rock, continued its vertical lines upward; the 
wide, projecting terraces of concrete, silver as the sea, followed the line of the waves, of the 
straight horizon.

roark was still sitting at his table when the men returned to begin their day in the drafting 
room. then the sketches were sent to snyte's office.

two days later, the final version of the house to be submitted to austen heller, the version 
chosen and edited by john erik snyte, executed by the chinese artist, lay swathed in tissue 
paper on a table. it was roark's house. his competitors had been eliminated. it was roark's 
house, but its walls were now of red brick, its windows were cut to conventional size and 
equipped with green shutters, two of its projecting wings were omitted, the great cantilevered 
terrace over the sea was replaced by a little wrought-iron balcony, and the house was 
provided with an entrance of ionic columns supporting a broken pediment, and

john erik snyte stood by the table, his two hands spread in the air over the sketch, without 
touching the virgin purity of its delicate colors.

"that is what mr. heller had in mind, i'm sure," he said. "pretty good...yes, pretty 
good...roark, how many times do i have to ask you not to smoke around a final sketch? 
stand away. you'll get ashes on it."

austen heller was expected at twelve o'clock. but at half past eleven mrs. symington arrived

he could see the distant band of the hudson at his window sill, with the small streaks of ships 
moving under his fingertips when he pressed them to the glass. he had a desk, two chairs, 
and a huge drafting table. the glass entrance door bore the words: "howard roark, 
architect." he stood in the hall for a long time, looking at the words. then he went in, and 
slammed his door, he picked up a t-square from the table and flung it down again, as if 
throwing an anchor.

john erik snyte had objected. when roark came to the office for his drawing instruments 
snyte emerged into the reception room, shook his hand warmly and said: "well, roark! well, 
how are you? come in, come right in, i want to speak to you!"

and with roark seated before his desk snyte proceeded loudly:

"look, fellow, i hope you've got sense enough not to hold it against me, anything that i

being done that way."

"we've signed the contract yesterday."

"oh, you have? well, that's splendid! well, look, roark, i'll tell you what we'll do: you bring the

"excuse me, mr. snyte. i'm sorry."

no reference to the heller house.

there were many occasions when lecturers rose to platforms and addressed trim audiences 
on the subject of the progress of american architecture. no one spoke of the heller house.

in the club rooms of the a.g.a. some opinions were expressed.

"it's a disgrace to the country," said ralston holcombe, "that a thing like that heller house is 
allowed to be erected. it's a blot on the profession. there ought to be a law."

"that's what drives clients away," said john erik snyte. "they see a house like that and they 
think all architects are crazy."

"i see no cause for indignation," said gordon l. prescott. "i think it's screamingly funny. it 
looks like a cross between a filling station and a comic-strip idea of a rocket ship to the moon."

"you watch it in a couple of years," said eugene pettingill, "and see what happens. the thing'll 
collapse like a house of cards."

"why speak in terms of years?" said guy francon. "those modernistic stunts never last more

his new home was one large room in a small, modern apartment house on a quiet street. he 
had chosen the house because it had no cornices over the windows and no paneling on the 
walls inside. his room contained a few pieces of simple furniture; it looked clean, vast and 
empty; one expected to hear echoes from its corners.

"why not go, just once?" said heller. "it won't be too awful. it might even amuse you. you'll 
see a lot of your old friends there. john erik snyte, peter keating, guy francon and his 
daughter--you should meet his daughter. have you ever read her stuff?"

"i'll go," said roark abruptly.

"you're unpredictable enough even to be sensible at times. i'll call for you at eight-thirty friday.

"how does one achieve that?"

"in one of two ways: by not looking at people at all or by looking at everything about them."

"which is preferable, miss francon?"

"whichever is hardest."

"but a desire to choose the hardest might be a confession of weakness in itself."

"of course, mr. roark. but it's the least offensive form of confession."

"if the weakness is there to be confessed at all."

then someone came flying through the crowd, and an arm fell about roark's shoulders. it 
was john erik snyte.

"roark, well of all people to see here!" he cried. "so glad, so glad! ages, hasn't it been? 
listen, i want to talk to you! let me have him for a moment, dominique."

roark bowed to her, his arms at his sides, a strand of hair falling forward, so that she did not 
see his face, but only the orange head bowed courteously for a moment, and he followed 
snyte into the crowd.

snyte was saying: "god, how you've come up these last few years! listen, do you know 
whether enright's planning to go in

he looked at the man as he 
looked occasionally at the pavement from a window on the thirtieth floor, wondering about his 
own body were it to be hurled down and what would happen when he struck against that 
pavement. he did not know the man's name, his profession or his past; he had no need to 
know; it was not a man to him, but only a force; toohey never saw men. perhaps it was the 
fascination of seeing that particular force so explicitly personified in a human body.

after a while he asked john erik snyte, pointing:

"who is that man?"

"that?" said snyte. "howard roark. you know, the enright house."

"oh," said toohey.

"what?"

"of course. it would be."

"want to meet him?"

"no," said toohey. "no, i don't want to meet him."

for the rest of the evening whenever some figure obstructed toohey's view of the hall, his 
head would jerk impatiently to find roark again. he did not want to look at roark; he had to 
look; just as he always had to look down at that distant pavement, dreading the sight.

ding is homaloidal, or--in the language of the layman--flat. the flowing life which 
comes from the sense of order in chaos, or, if you prefer, from unity in diversity, as well as 
vice versa, which is the realization of the contradiction inherent in architecture, is here 
absolutely absent. i am really trying to express myself as clearly as i can, but it is impossible 
to present a dialectic state by covering it up with an old fig leaf of logic just for the sake of the 
mentally lazy layman."

john erik snyte testified modestly and unobtrusively that he had employed roark in his office, 
that roark had been an unreliable, disloyal and unscrupulous employee, and that roark had 
started his career by stealing a client from him.

on the fourth day of the trial the plaintiff's attorney called his last witness.

"miss dominique francon," he announced solemnly.

mallory gasped, but no one heard it; mike's hand clamped down on his wrist and made him 
keep still.

hopton stoddard added a generous sum to the award he had won from roark, and the 
stoddard temple was rebuilt for its new purpose by a group of architects chosen by ellsworth 
toohey: peter keating, gordon l. prescott, john erik snyte and somebody named gus 
webb, a boy of twenty-four who liked to utter obscenities when passing well-bred women on 
the street, and who had never handled an architectural commission of his own. three of these 
men had social and professional standing; gus webb had none; toohey included him for that 
reason. of the four gus webb had the loudest voice and the greatest self-assurance. gus 
webb said he was afraid of nothing; he meant it. they were all members of the council of 
american builders.

th the embarrassment of speaking in 
public for the first time; he said that he admired ellsworth toohey and had always agreed with 
toohey's social ideals, but if a group of people felt that some person was acquiring power 
over them, that was the time to fight such a person. the majority overruled him. ellsworth 
toohey was asked to speak at the luncheon, the attendance was enormous and toohey 
made a witty, gracious speech. many members of the a.g.a. joined the council of american 
builders, john erik snyte among the first.

the four architects in charge of the stoddard reconstruction met in keating's office, around a 
table on which they spread blueprints of the temple, photographs of roark's original 
drawings, obtained from the contractor, and a clay model which keating had ordered made. 
they talked about the depression and its disastrous effect on the building industry; they talked 
about women, and gordon l. prescott told a few jokes of a bathroom nature. then gus webb

 stairways had railings of hand-wrought aluminum, the shower stalls 
were glass-enclosed, the recreation rooms had gold-leafed corinthian pilasters. the huge 
windows were left untouched, merely crossed by floorlines.

the four architects had decided to achieve an effect of harmony and therefore not to use any 
historical style in its pure form. peter keating designed the white marble semi-doric portico 
that rose over the main entrance, and the venetian balconies for which new doors were cut. 
john erik snyte designed the small semi-gothic spire surmounted by a cross, and the 
bandcourses of stylized acanthus leaves which were cut into the limestone of the walls. 
gordon l. prescott designed the semi-renaissance cornice, and the glass-enclosed terrace 
projecting from the third floor. gus webb designed a cubistic ornament to frame the original 
windows, and the modern neon sign on the roof, which read: "the hopton stoddard home for 
subnormal children."

"comes the revolution," said gus webb, lookin
