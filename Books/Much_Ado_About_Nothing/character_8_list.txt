Borachio - 
                An
associate of Don John. Borachio is the lover of Margaret, Hero's
serving woman. He conspires with Don John to trick Claudio and Don
Pedro into thinking that Hero is unfaithful to Claudio. His name
means "drunkard" in Italian, which might serve as a subtle direction
to the actor playing him.
