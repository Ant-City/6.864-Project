"oh, he can read law in judge parmalee's office over in

anyway."

"why?"

"the war, goose!  the war's going to start any day, and you don't
suppose any of us would stay in college with a war going on, do
you?"

"you know there isn't going to be any war," said scarlett, bored.
"it's all just talk.  why, ashley wilkes and his father told pa
just last week that our commissioners in washington would come
to--to--an--amicable agreement with mr. lincoln about the
confederacy.  and anyway, the yankees are too scared of us to
fight.  there won't be any war, and i'm tired of hearing about
it."

"not going to be any war!" cried the twins indignantly, as though
they had been defrauded.

"if you'll promise, we'll tell you a secret," said stuart.

"you know, ashley wilkes' cousin who lives in atlanta, miss

"i do, and a sillier old lady i never met in all my life."

"well, when we were in atlanta yesterday, waiting for the home
train, her carriage went by the depot and she stopped and talked
to us, and she told us there was going to be an engagement
announced tomorrow night at the wilkes ball."

refusing to give a yes or no answer, laughing if they sulked,

promised them the whole of tomorrow--seats by her at the barbecue,
all the waltzes (and they'd see to it that the dances were all
waltzes!) and the supper intermission.  this was worth getting
expelled from the university.

filled with new enthusiasm by their success, they lingered on,
talking about the barbecue and the ball and ashley wilkes and
melanie hamilton, interrupting each other, making jokes and
laughing at them, hinting broadly for invitations to supper.  some
time had passed before they realized that scarlett was having very
little to say.  the atmosphere had somehow changed.  just how, the
twins did not know, but the fine glow had gone out of the
afternoon.  scarlett seemed to be paying little attention to what
they said, although she made the correct answers.  sensing
something they could not understand, baffled and an

ashley liked europe.  he's always talking about it."

"well--you know how the wilkes are.  they are kind of queer about
music and books and scenery.  mother says it's because their
grandfather came from virginia.  she says virginians set quite a
store by such things."

surprise and happiness that would come over his face when he
realized that she really loved him, and she heard the words he
would say asking her to be his wife.

naturally, she would have to say then that she simply couldn't
think of marrying a man when he was engaged to another girl, but
he would insist and finally she would let herself be persuaded.
then they would decide to run off to jonesboro that very afternoon
and--

why, by this time tomorrow night, she might be mrs. ashley wilkes!

she sat up in bed, hugging her knees, and for a long happy moment
she was mrs. ashley wilkes--ashley's bride!  then a slight chill
entered her heart.  suppose it didn't work out this way?  suppose
ashley didn't beg her to run away with him?  resolutely she pushed
the thought from her mind.

"i won't think of that now," she said firmly.  "if i think of it
now, it will upset me.  there's no reason why things won't come
out the way i want them--if he loves me.  and i know he does!"

"oh!  that letter," thought scarlett.  "was that what he meant?"

"i don't believe it," said mrs. merriwether firmly.  "you
misunderstood his meaning."

"i never misunderstand ashley," melanie replied quietly, though
her lips were trembling.  "i understand him perfectly.  he meant
exactly what captain butler meant, only he didn't say it in a rude
way."

"you should be ashamed of yourself, comparing a fine man like
ashley wilkes to a scoundrel like captain butler!  i suppose you,
too, think the cause is nothing!"

"i--i don't know what i think," melanie began uncertainly, her
fire deserting her and panic at her outspokenness taking hold of
her.  "i--i'd die for the cause, like ashley would.  but--i mean--
i mean, i'll let the men folks do the thinking, because they are

years, was frightened by the violence of her feelings.  when she
had stood in the parlor at twelve oaks and seen him married to
melanie, she had thought she could never love him with a more
heartbreaking intensity than she did at that moment.  but now she
knew her feelings of that long-past night were those of a spoiled
child thwarted of a toy.  now, her emotions were sharpened by her
long dreams of him, heightened by the repression she had been
forced to put on her tongue.

this ashley wilkes in his faded, patched uniform, his blond hair
bleached tow by summer suns, was a different man from the easy-
going, drowsy-eyed boy she had loved to desperation before the war.
and he was a thousand times more thrilling.  he was bronzed and
lean now, where he had once been fair and slender, and the long
golden mustache drooping about his mouth, cavalry style, was the
last touch needed to make him the perfect picture of a soldier.

he stood with military straightness in his old uniform, his pis

the torturing picture which had worn a groove in her tired mind
these past several months--lieutenant dallas mclure dying in a
jolting ox cart in the rain on the long, terrible retreat into
maryland.

captain carey ashburn's useless arm was hurting him again and
moreover he was depressed by the thought that his courtship of
scarlett was at a standstill.  that had been the situation ever
since the news of ashley wilkes' capture, though the connection
between the two events did not occur to him.  scarlett and melanie
both were thinking of ashley, as they always did when urgent tasks
or the necessity of carrying on a conversation did not divert them.
scarlett was thinking bitterly, sorrowfully:  he must be dead or
else we would have heard.  melanie, stemming the tide of fear again
and again, through endless hours, was telling herself:  "he can't
be dead.  i'd know it--i'd feel it if he were dead."  rhett butler

"as to why i have made no further advances," he pursued blandly, as
though she had not signified that the conversation was at an end,
"i'm waiting for you to grow up a little more.  you see, it
wouldn't be much fun for me to kiss you now and i'm quite selfish
about my pleasures.  i never fancied kissing children."

he smothered a grin, as from the corner of his eye he saw her bosom
heave with silent wrath.

"and then, too," he continued softly, "i was waiting for the memory
of the estimable ashley wilkes to fade."

at the mention of ashley's name, sudden pain went through her,
sudden hot tears stung her lids.  fade?  the memory of ashley would
never fade, not if he were dead a thousand years.  she thought of
ashley wounded, dying in a far-off yankee prison, with no blankets
over him, with no one who loved him to hold his hand, and she was
filled with hate for the well-fed man who sat beside her, jeers
just beneath the surface of his drawling voice.

she was too angry to speak and they rode alon

scarlett snatched the letter from his hand.  it was addressed to
melly in miss pitty's writing but that did not make her hesitate a
moment.  she ripped it open and miss pitty's inclosed note fell to
the ground.  within the envelope there was a piece of folded paper,
grimy from the dirty pocket in which it had been carried, creased
and ragged about the edges.  it bore the inscription in ashley's
hand:  "mrs. george ashley wilkes, care miss sarah jane hamilton,
atlanta, or twelve oaks, jonesboro, ga."

with fingers that shook, she opened it and read:

"beloved, i am coming home to you--"

tears began to stream down her face so that she could not read and
her heart swelled up until she felt she could not bear the joy of
it.  clutching the letter to her, she raced up the porch steps and
down the hall, past the parlor where all the inhabitants of tara
were getting in one another's way as they worked over the

"for heaven's sake, ashley wilkes!  don't stand there and talk
nonsense at me when it's us who are going to be winnowed out!"

something of her exasperated weariness seemed to penetrate his
mind, calling it back from its wanderings, for he raised her hands
with tenderness and, turning them palm up, looked at the calluses.

"these are the most beautiful hands i know," he said and kissed
each palm lightly.  "they are beautiful because they are strong and

she was hot with sudden rage and she stuttered until words came.

take a cent if he were starving!  you don't understand him, how
honorable, how proud he is!  of course, you can't understand him,

she jerked her hands away from him.

about ashley wilkes.  we'll always fall out about him, because you
can't understand him."

"i suppose you understand him like a book," said rhett maliciously.
"no, scarlett, if i am to lend you the money i reserve the right to
discuss ashley wilkes in any terms i care to.  i waive the right to
collect interest on my loan but not that right.  and there are a
number of things about that young man i'd like to know."

beneath too many millstones.  there's tara.  that's a man-sized job
in itself.  there's your sick father added on.  he'll never be any

burdens without ashley wilkes and his family on your hands."

"he's not on my hands.  he helps--"

"oh, for god's sake," he said impatiently.  "don't let's have any
more of that.  he's no help.  he's on your hands and he'll be on
them, or on somebody's, till he dies.  personally, i'm sick of him
as a topic of conversation. . . .  how much money do you want?"

her and trampling on them, he still tho

"rhett, do you really--is it to protect me that you--"

"yes, my dear, it is my much advertised chivalry that makes me
protect you."  the mocking light began to dance in his black eyes
and all signs of earnestness fled from his face.  "and why?
because of my deep love for you, mrs. kennedy.  yes, i have
silently hungered and thirsted for you and worshipped you from
afar; but being an honorable man, like mr. ashley wilkes, i have

from you, knowing you as i do.  but foolishly, i trusted you."

"i don't know what you mean."

"i think you do.  at any rate, you look very guilty.  as i was
riding along ivy street a while ago, on my way to call on you, who

to let me know how brave she thought i was to have struck a blow
for the confederacy, even at the eleventh hour."

night because you acted so heroic."

to which you agreed, and that was that it should not go to the
support of ashley wilkes."

"you do bore me.  you bore me to distraction," said scarlett
coldly, hoping to annoy him and divert him from the ever-
unfortunate subject of ashley.  but he only laughed shortly and
refused to take up the gauntlet.

before dawn the news had trickled about that the military inquiry
would take place that day.  the townspeople, heavy eyed from
sleeplessness and anxious waiting, knew that the safety of some of
their most prominent citizens rested on three things--the ability
of ashley wilkes to stand on his feet and appear before the
military board, as though he suffered nothing more serious than a
morning-after headache, the word of belle watling that these men
had been in her house all evening and the word of rhett butler that
he had been with them.

was a sorry one, it was dreadful that the poor thing should
discover he had been untrue to her.  and it was doubly dreadful
that his death should occur simultaneously with the discovery of
his infidelity.  after all, a poor husband was better than no
husband at all, and the yankee ladies decided they'd be extra nice
to scarlett.  but the others, mrs. meade, mrs. merriwether, mrs.

they'd laugh in their faces every time they saw them.  that would
teach them a little courtesy.

much of the whispering that went on in the dark rooms on the north
side of town that night was on this same subject.  atlanta ladies
vehemently told their husbands that they did not care a rap what
the yankees thought.  but inwardly they felt that running an indian

yankee grins and not being able to tell the truth about their

green eyes, wide and misty, and the
tender curve of her lips and for a moment his breath stopped.  then
his mouth went down violently at one corner and he swore with
passionate impatience.

"scarlett o'hara, you're a fool!"

before she could withdraw her mind from its far places, his arms
were around her, as sure and hard as on the dark road to tara, so
long ago.  she felt again the rush of helplessness, the sinking
yielding, the surging tide of warmth that left her limp.  and the
quiet face of ashley wilkes was blurred and drowned to nothingness.
he bent back her head across his arm and kissed her, softly at
first, and then with a swift gradation of intensity that made her
cling to him as the only solid thing in a dizzy swaying world.  his
insistent mouth was parting her shaking lips, sending wild tremors
along her nerves, evoking from her sensations she had never known
she was capable of feeling.  and before a swimming giddiness spun
her round and round, she knew that she was kissing him back.

"
