chapter 1

the departure of boromir

aragorn sped on up the hill. every now and again he bent to the ground. hobbits go light, and their footprints are not easy even for a ranger to read, but not far from the top a spring crossed the path, and in the wet earth he saw what he was seeking.
'i read the signs aright,' he said to himself. 'frodo ran to the hill-top. i wonder what he saw there? but he returned by the same way, and went down the hill again.'
aragorn hesitated. he desired to go to the high seat himself, hoping to see there something that would guide him in his perplexities; but time was pressing. suddenly he leaped forward, and ran to the summit, across the great flag-stones, and up the steps. then sitting in the high seat he looked out. but the sun seemed darkened, and the world dim and remote. he turned from the north back again to north, and saw nothing save the distant hills, unless it were t

 west side of the river. he stiffened. there were cries, and among them, to his horror, he could distinguish the harsh voices of orcs. then suddenly with a deep-throated call a great horn blew, and the blasts of it smote the hills and echoed in the hollows, rising in a mighty shout above the roaring of the falls.
'the horn of boromir!' he cried. 'he is in need!' he sprang down the steps and away, leaping down the path. 'alas! an ill fate is on me this day, and all that i do goes amiss. where is sam?'
as he ran the cries came louder, but fainter now and desperately the horn was blowing. fierce and shrill rose the yells of the orcs, and suddenly the horn-calls ceased. aragorn raced down the last slope, but before he could reach the hill's foot, the sounds died away; and as he turned to the left and ran towards them they retreated, until at last he could hear them no more. drawing his bright sword and crying elendil! elendil! he crashed through the trees.

heard the horn-but too late, it seems. i fear you have taken deadly hurt.'
'boromir is dead,' said aragorn. 'i am unscathed, for i was not here with him. he fell defending the hobbits, while i was away upon the hill.'
'the hobbits!' cried gimli 'where are they then? where is frodo?'
'i do not know,' answered aragorn wearily. 'before he died boromir told me that the orcs had bound them; he did not think that they were dead. i sent him to follow merry and pippin; but i did not ask him if frodo or sam were with him: not until it was too late. all that i have done today has gone amiss. what is to be done now?'
'first we must tend the fallen,' said legolas. 'we cannot leave him lying like carrion among these foul orcs.'
'but we must be swift,' said gimli. 'he would not wish us to linger. we must follow the orcs, if there is hope that any of our company are living prisoners.'
'but we do not know whether the ring-bearer is with them or not ' said aragorn. 'are we to abandon him? must we not seek

ot tell whether any of the hobbits have come back since the search for frodo began.' he returned to the bank, close to where the rill from the spring trickled out into the river. 'there are some clear prints here,' he said. 'a hobbit waded out into the water and back; but i cannot say how long ago.'
'how then do you read this riddle?' asked gimli.
aragorn did not answer at once, but went back to the camping-place and looked at the baggage. 'two packs are missing.' he said, 'and one is certainly sam's: it was rather large and heavy. this then is the answer: frodo has gone by boat, and his servant has gone with him. frodo must have returned while we were all away. i met sam going up the hill and told him to follow me; but plainly he did not do so. he guessed his master s mind and came back here before frodo had gone. he did not find it easy to leave sam behind!'
'but why should he leave us behind, and without a word?' said gimli. 'that was a strange deed!'
'and a brave deed,' said aragorn.

'sam was right, i think. frodo did not wish to lead any friend to death with him in mordor. but he knew that he must go himself. something happened after he left us that overcame his fear and doubt.'
'maybe hunting orcs came on him and he fled,' said legolas.
'he fled, certainly,' said aragorn, 'but not, i think, from orcs.' what he thought was the cause of frodo's sudden resolve and flight aragorn did not say. the last words of boromir he long kept secret.
'well, so much at least is now clear,' sai

d legolas: 'frodo is no longer on this side of the river: only he can have taken the boat. and sam is with him; only he would have taken his pack.'
'our choice then,' said gimli, 'is either to take the remaining boat and follow frodo, or else to follow the orcs on foot. there is little hope either way. we have already lost precious hours.'
'let me think!' said aragorn. 'and now may i make a right choice and change the evil fate of this unhappy day!' he stood silent for a moment. 'i will follow the orcs,' he said at last. 'i would have guided frodo to mordor and gone with him to the end; but

'look!' cried legolas, pointing up into the pale sky above them. 'there is the eagle again! he is very high. he seems to be flying now away, from this land back to the north. he is going with great speed. look!'
'no, not even my eyes can see him, my good legolas,' said aragorn. 'he must be far aloft indeed. i wonder what is his errand, if he is the same bird that i have seen before. but look! i can see something nearer at hand and more urgent; there is something moving over the plain!'
'many things,' said legolas. 'it is a great company on foot; but i cannot say more, nor see what kind of folk they may be. they are many leagues away: twelve, i guess; but the flatness of the plain is hard to measure.'
'i think, nonetheless, that we no longer need any trail to tell us which way to go,' said gimli. 'let us find a path down to the fields as quick

find, if you come to the king.'
'it is tidings more grievous than any in this land can understand, though it may touch them sorely ere the year is much older,' said aragorn. 'but when the great fall, the less must lead. my part it has been to guide our company on the long road from moria. through lórien we came - of which it were well that you should learn the truth ere you speak of it again - and thence down the leagues of the great river to the falls of rauros. there boromir was slain by the same orcs whom you destroyed.'
'your news is all of woe!' cried éomer in dismay. 'great harm is this death to minas tirith, and to us all. that was a worthy man! all spoke his praise. he came seldom to the mark, for he was ever in the wars on the east-borders; but i have seen him. more like to the swift sons of eorl than to the grave men of gondor he seemed to me, and likely to prove a great captain of his people when his time came. but we have had no word of this grief out of gondor. when did he

a smaller and lighter horse, but restive and fiery, was brought to legolas. arod was his name. but legolas asked them to take off saddle and rein. 'i need them not,' he said, and leaped lightly up, and to their wonder arod was tame and willing beneath him, moving here and there with but a spoken word: such was the elvish way with all good beasts. gimli was lifted up behind his friend. and he clung to him, not much more at ease than sam gamgee in a boat.
'farewell, and may you find what you seek!' cried éomer. 'return with what speed you may, and let our swords hereafter shine together!'
'i will come,' said aragorn.
'and i will come, too,' said gimli. 'the matter of the lady galadriel lies still between us. i have yet to teach you gentle speech. '
'we shall see,' said éomer. 'so many strange things have chanced that to learn the praise of a fair lady under the loving strokes of a dwarf's axe will seem no great wonder. farewe

n took it in his fingers and knotted it again into a loose bracelet of two loops and slipped it over his hands. then he lay very still.
'pick up those prisoners!' shouted uglúk. 'don't play any tricks with them! if they are not alive when we get back, someone else will die too.'
an orc seized pippin like a sack. put its head between his tied hands, grabbed his arms and dragged them down, until pippin's face was crushed against its neck; then it jolted off with him. another treated merry in the same way. the orc's clawlike hand gripped pippin's arms like iron; the nails bit into him. he shut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams.
suddenly he was thrown on to the stony floor again. it was early night, but the slim moon was already falling westward. they were on the edge of a cliff that seemed to look out over a sea of pale mist. there was a sound of water falling nearby.
'the scouts have come back at last,' said an orc close at hand.
'well, what did you discover?' growled the voice of

aced, perhaps: swords and whips on one side, and nasty spears on the other! little people should not meddle _in affairs that are too big for them.' his fingers continued to grope. there was a light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes.
the thought came suddenly into pippin's mind, as if caught direct from the urgent thought of his enemy: 'grishnákh knows about the ring! he's looking for it, while uglúk is busy: he probably wants it for himself.' cold fear was in pippin's heart, yet at the same time he was wondering what use he could make of grishnákh's desire.
'i don't think you will find it that way,' he whispered. 'it isn't easy to find.'
'find it?' said grishnákh: his fingers stopped crawling and gripped pippin's shoulder. 'find what? what are you talking about, little one?'. for a moment pippin was silent. then suddenly in the darkness he made a noise in his throat: gollum, gollum. 'nothing, my precious,' he added.
the hobbits felt grishnákh's fingers twitch. 'o ho!' hissed t

even as he spoke the dark edge of the forest loomed up straight before them. night seemed to have taken refuge under its great trees, creeping away from the coming dawn.
'lead on, master brandybuck!' said pippin. 'or lead back! we have been warned against fangorn. but one so knowing will not have forgotten that.'
'i have not,' answered merry; 'but the forest seems better to me, all the same, than turning back into the middle of a battle.'
he led the way in under the huge branches of the trees. old beyond guessing, they seemed. great trailing beards of lichen hung from them, blowing and swaying in the breeze. out of the shadows the hobbits peeped, gazing back down the slope: little furtive figures that in the dim light looked like elf-children in the deeps of time peering out of the wild wood in wonder at their first dawn.

'hrum, hoom,' murmured the voice, a deep voice like a very deep woodwind instrument. 'very odd indeed! do not be hasty, that is my motto. but if i had seen you, before i heard your voices - i liked them: nice little voices; they reminded me of something i cannot remember - if i had seen you before i heard you, i should have just trodden on you, taking you for little orcs, and found out my mistake afterwards. very odd you

ed. all the while, as he walked, he talked to himself in a long running stream of musical sounds.
the hobbits were silent for some time. they felt, oddly enough, safe and comfortable, and they had a great deal to think and wonder about. at last pippin ventured to speak again.
'please, treebeard,' he said, 'could i ask you something? why did celeborn warn us against your forest? he told us not to risk getting entangled in it.'
'hmm, did he now?' rumbled treebeard. 'and i might have said much the same, if you had been going the other way. do not risk getting entangled in the woods of laurelindórenan! that is what the elves used to call it, but now they make the name shorter: lothlórien they call it. perhaps they are right: maybe it is fading; not growing. land of the valley of singing gold, that was it, once upon a time. now it is the dreamflower. ah well! but it is a queer place, and not for just any one to venture in. i am surprised that you ever got out, but much more surprised that yo

ny ents round there do you?' he asked. 'well, not ents, entwives i should really say.'
'entwives?' said pippin. 'are they like you at all?'
'yes, hm, well no: i do not really know now,' said treebeard thoughtfully. 'but they would like your country, so i just wondered.'
treebeard was however especially interested in everything that concerned gandalf; and most interested of all in saruman's doings. the hobbits regretted very much that they knew so little about them: only a rather vague report by sam of what gandalf had told the council. but they were clear at any rate that uglúk and his troop came from isengard, and spoke of saruman as their master.
'hm, hoom!' said treebeard, when at last their story had wound and wandered down to the battle of the orcs and the riders of rohan. 'well, well! that is a bundle of news and no mistake. you have not told me all, no indeed, not by a long way. but i do not doubt that you are doing as gandalf would wish. there is something very big going on, that

y, only in short; and then we must end our talk: tomorrow we have councils to call, and work to do, and maybe a journey to begin.'
'it is rather a strange and sad story,' he went on after a pause. 'when the world was young, and the woods were wide and wild, the ents and the entwives - and there were entmaidens then: ah! the loveliness of fimbrethil, of wandlimb the lightfooted, in the days of our youth! - they walked together and they housed together. but our hearts did not go on growing in the same way: the ents gave their love to things that they met in the world, and the entwives gave their thought to other things, for the ents loved the great trees; and the wild woods, and the slopes of the high hills; and they drank of the mountain-streams, and ate only such fruit as the trees let fall in their path; and they learned of the elves and spoke with the trees. but the entwives gave their minds to the lesser trees, and to the meads in the sunshine beyond the feet of the forests; and they s

rhead, running on a stiff easterly wind. treebeard was not to be seen; but while merry and pippin were bathing in the basin by the arch, they heard him humming and singing, as he came up the path between the trees.
'hoo, ho! good morning, merry and pippin!' he boomed, when he saw them. 'you sleep long. i have been many a hundred strides already today. now we will have a drink, and go to entmoot.'
he poured them out two full bowls from a stone jar; but from a different jar. the taste was not the same as it had been the night before: it was earthier and richer, more sustaining and food-like, so to speak. while the hobbits drank, sitting on the edge of the bed, and nibbling small pieces of elf-cake (more because they felt that eating was a necessary part of breakfast than because they felt hungry), treebeard stood, humming in entish or elvish or some strange tongue, and looking up at the sky.
'where is entmoot?' pippin ventured to ask.
'hoo, eh? entmoot?' said treebeard, turning round. 'it i

 west and from the east.
several ents had already arrived. more were coming in down the other paths, and some were now following treebeard. as they drew near the hobbits gazed at them. they had expected to see a number of creatures as much like treebeard as one hobbit is like another (at any rate to a stranger's eye); and they were very much surprised to see nothing of the kind. the ents were as different from one another as trees from trees: some as different as one tree is from another of the same name but quite different growth and history; and some as different as one tree-kind from another, as birch from beech; oak from fir. there were a few older ents, bearded and gnarled like hale but ancient trees (though none looked as ancient as treebeard); and there were tall strong ents, clean-limbed and smooth-skinned like forest-trees in their prime; but there were no young ents, no saplings. altogether there were about two dozen standing on the wide grassy floor of the dingle, and as many m

were other kinds. some recalled the chestnut: brown-skinned ents with large splayfingered hands, and short thick legs. some recalled the ash: tall straight grey ents with many-fingered hands and long legs; some the fir (the tallest ents), and others the birch, the rowan, and the linden. but when the ents all gathered round treebeard, bowing their heads slightly, murmuring in their slow musical voices, and looking long and intently at the strangers, then the hobbits saw that they were all of the same kindred, and all had the same eyes: not all so old or so deep as treebeard's, but all with the same slow, steady, thoughtful expression, and the same green flicker.
as soon as the whole company was assembled, standing in a wide circle round treebeard, a curious and unintelligible conversation began. the ents began to murmur slowly: first one joined and then another, until they were all chanting together in a long rising and falling rhythm, now louder on one side of the ring, now dying away the

d then they climbed down to the gushing water. they drank a little, a clean, cold, sharp draught, and sat down on a mossy stone, watching the patches of sun on the grass and the shadows of the sailing clouds passing over the floor of the dingle. the murmur of the ents went on. it seemed a very strange and remote place, outside their world, and far from everything that had ever happened to them. a great longing came over them for the faces and voices of their companions, especially for frodo and sam, and for strider.
at last there came a pause in the ent-voices; and looking up they saw treebeard coming towards them. with another ent at his side.
'hm, hoom, here i am again,' said treebeard. 'are you getting weary, or feeling impatient, hmm, eh? well, i am afraid that you must not get impatient yet. we have finished the first stage now; but i have still got to explain things again to those that live a long way off, far from isengard, and those that i could not get round to before the moot, a

 nearly it was revealed to the enemy, but it escaped. i had some part in that: for i sat in a high place, and i strove with the dark tower; and the shadow passed. then i was weary, very weary; and i walked long in dark thought.'
'then you know about frodo!' said gimli. 'how do things go with him?'
'i cannot say. he was saved from a great peril, but many lie before him still. he resolved to go alone to mordor, and he set out: that is all that i can say.'
'not alone,' said legolas. 'we think that sam went with him.'
'did he!' said gandalf, and there was a gleam in his eye and a smile on his face. 'did he indeed? it is news to me, yet it does not surprise me. good! very good! you lighten my heart. you must tell me more. now sit by me and tell me the tale of your journey.'
the companions sat on the ground at his feet, and aragorn took up the tale. for a long while gandalf said nothing, and he asked no questions. his hands were spread upon his knees, and his eyes were closed. at last when arag

llowing the winding way up the green shoulders of the hills, they came at last to the wide wind-swept walls and the gates of edoras.
there sat many men in bright mail, who sprang at once to their feet and barred the way with spears. 'stay, strangers here unknown!' they cried in the tongue of the riddermark, demanding the names and errand of the strangers. wonder was in their eyes but little friendliness; and they looked darkly upon gandalf.
'well do i understand your speech,' he answered in the same language; 'yet few strangers do so. why then do you not speak in the common tongue, as is the custom in the west, if you wish to be answered?'
'it is the will of théoden king that none should enter his gates, save those who know our tongue and are our friends,' replied one of the guards. 'none are welcome here in days of war but our own folk, and those that come from mundburg in the land of gondor. who are you that come heedless over the plain thus strangely clad, riding horses like to our ow

'the courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, théoden son of thengel,' said gandalf. 'has not the messenger from your gate reported the names of my companions? seldom has any lord of rohan received thre

raiment or with hide of close-fitting grey and brown. their limbs were long, and their hands had many fingers; their hair was stiff, and their beards grey-green as moss. they gazed out with solemn eyes, but they were not looking at the riders: their eyes were bent northwards. suddenly they lifted their long hands to their mouths, and sent forth ringing calls, clear as notes of a horn, but more musical and various. the calls were answered; and turning again, the riders saw other creatures of the same kind approaching, striding through the grass. they came swiftly from the north, walking like wading herons in their gait, but not in their speed; for their legs in their long paces beat quicker than the heron's wings. the riders cried aloud in wonder, and some set their hands upon their sword-hilts.
'you need no weapons,' said gandalf. 'these are but herdsmen. they are not enemies, indeed they are not concerned with us at all.'
so it seemed to be; for as he spoke the tall creatures, without a

for a moment théoden and éomer and all his men stared at them in wonder. amid all the wreck of isengard this seemed to them the strangest sight. but before the king could speak, the small smoke-breathing figure became suddenly aware of them, as they sat there silent on the edge of the mist. he sprang to his feet. a young man he looked, or like one, though not much more than half a man in height; his head of brown curling hair was uncovered, but he was clad in a travel-stained cloak of the same hue and shape as the companions of gandalf had worn when they rode to edoras. he bowed very low. putting his hand upon his breast. then, seeming not to observe the wizard and his friends, he turned to éomer and the king.
'welcome, my lords, to isengard!' he said. 'we are the doorwardens. meriadoc, son of saradoc is my name; and my companion, who, alas! is overcome with weariness' - here he gave the other a dig with his foot - 'is peregrin, son of paladin, of the house of took. far in the nort

'i will come with you,' said théoden. 'farewell, my hobbits! may we meet again in my house! there you shall sit beside me and tell me all that your hearts desire: the deeds of your grandsires, as far as you can reckon them; and we will speak also of tobold the old and his herb-lore. farewell!'
the hobbits bowed low. 'so that is the king of rohan!' said pippin in an undertone. 'a fine old fellow. very polite.'

flotsam and jetsam

gandalf and the king's company rode away, turning eastward to make the circuit of the ruined walls of isengard. but aragorn, gimli, and legolas remained behind. leaving arod and hasufel to stray in search of grass, they came and sat beside the hobbits.
'well, well! the hunt is over, and we meet again at last, where none of us ever thought to come,' said aragorn.
'and now that the great ones have gone to discuss high matters,' said legolas, 'the hunters can perhaps learn the answers

y thoughtful after gandalf had gone. he had evidently learnt a lot in a short time and was digesting it. he looked at us and said: "hm, well, i find you are not such hasty folk as i thought. you said much less than you might, and not more than you should. hm, this is a bundle of news and no mistake! well, now treebeard must get busy again."
'before he went, we got a little news out of him; and it did not cheer us up at all. but for the moment we thought more about you three than about frodo and sam, or about poor boromir. for we gathered that there was a great battle going on, or soon would be, and that you were in it, and might never come out of it.
'"huorns will help," said treebeard. then he went away and we did not see him again until this morning.
'it was deep night. we lay on top of a pile of stone, and could see nothing beyond it. mist or shadows blotted out everything like a great blanket all round us. the air seemed hot and heavy; and it was full of rustlings, creakings, and a mu

; 'and also saruman's spy and servant in rohan. fate has not been kinder to him than he deserves. the sight of the ruin of all that he thought so strong and magnificent must have been almost punishment enough. but i fear that worse awaits him.'
'yes, i don't suppose treebeard sent him to orthanc out of kindness,' said merry. 'he seemed rather grimly delighted with the business and was laughing to himself when he went to get his bathe and drink. we spent a busy time after that, searching the flotsam, and rummaging about. we found two or three store-rooms in different places nearby, above the flood-level. but treebeard sent some ents down, and they carried off a great deal of the stuff.
'"we want man-food for twenty-five," the ents said, so you can see that somebody had counted your company carefully before you arrived. you three were evidently meant to go with the great people. but you would not have fared any better. we kept as good as we sent, i promise you. better, because we sent no dr

'"what about drink?" i said to the ents.
'"there is water of isen," they said, "and that is good enough for ents and men." but i hope that the ents may have found time to brew some of their draughts from the mountain-springs, and we shall see gandalf's beard curling when he returns. after the ents had gone, we felt tired, and hungry. but we did not grumble - our labours had been well rewarded. it was through our search for man-food that pippin discovered the prize of all the flotsam, those hornblower barrels. "pipe-weed is better after food," said pippin; that is how the situation arose.'
'we understand it all perfectly now,' said gimli.
'all except one thing,' said aragorn: 'leaf from the southfarthing in isengard. the more i consider it, the more curious i find it. i have never been in isengard, but i have journeyed in this land, and i know well the empty countries that lie between rohan and the shire. neither goods nor folk have passed that way for many a long year, not

. the many faces of the stone had sharp edges as though they had been newly chiselled. a few scorings. and small flake-like splinters near the base, were all the marks that it bore of the fury of the ents.
on the eastern side, in the angle of two piers, there was a great door, high above the ground; and over it was a shuttered window, opening upon a balcony hedged with iron bars. up to the threshold of the door there mounted a flight of twenty-seven broad stairs, hewn by some unknown art of the same black stone. this was the only entrance to the tower; but many tall windows were cut with deep embrasures in the climbing walls: far up they peered like little eyes in the sheer faces of the horns.
at the foot of the stairs gandalf and the king dismounted. 'i will go up,' said gandalf. 'i have been in orthanc and i know my peril.'
'and i too will go up,' said the king. 'i am old, and fear no peril any more. i wish to speak with the enemy who has done me so much wrong. éomer shall come with me

an ever that's all,' pippin argued. 'that-glass ball, now. he seemed mighty pleased with it. he knows or guesses something about it. but does he tell us what? no, not a word. yet i picked it up, and i saved it from rolling into a pool. here, i'll take that, my lad - that's all. i wonder what it is? it felt so very heavy.' pippin's voice fell very low as if he was talking to himself.
'hullo!' said merry. 'so that's what is bothering you? now, pippin my lad, don't forget gildor's saying - the one sam used to quote: do not meddle in the at fairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.'
'but our whole life for months has been one long meddling in the affairs of wizards,' said pippin. 'i should like a bit of information as well as danger. i should like a look at that ball.'
'go to sleep!' said merry. 'you'll get information enough, sooner or later. my dear pippin, no took ever beat a brandybuck for inquisitiveness; but is this the time, i ask you?'
'all right! what's the harm in my

shadowfax tossed his head and cried aloud, as if a trumpet had summoned him to battle. then he sprang forward. fire flew from his feet; night rushed over him.
as he fell slowly into sleep, pippin had a strange feeling: he and gandalf were still as stone, seated upon the statue of a running horse, while the world rolled away beneath his feet with a great noise of wind.

'well, master, we're in a fix and no mistake,' said sam gamgee. he stood despondently with hunched shoulders beside frodo, and peered out with puckered eyes into the gloom.
it was the third evening since they had fled from the company, as far as they could tell: they had almost lost count of the hours during which they had climbed and laboured among the barren slopes and stones of the emyn muil, sometimes retracing their steps because they could find no way forward, sometimes discovering that they had wandered in a circle back to where they had been

 them was fading to a sullen brown. far away to the right the anduin, that had gleamed fitfully in sun-breaks during the day, was now hidden in shadow. but their eyes did not look beyond the river, back to gondor, to their friends, to the lands of men. south and east they stared to where, at the edge of the oncoming night, a dark line hung, like distant mountains of motionless smoke. every now and again a tiny red gleam far away flickered upwards on the rim of earth and sky.
`what a fix! ' said sam. `that's the one place in all the lands we've ever heard of that we don't want to see any closer; and that's the one place we're trying to get to! and that's just where we can't get, nohow. we've come the wrong way altogether, seemingly. we can't get down; and if we did get down, we'd find all that green land a nasty bog, i'll warrant. phew! can you smell it?' he sniffed at the wind.
'yes, i can smell it,' said frodo, but he did not move, and his eyes remained fixed, staring out towards the dar

k line and the flickering flame. `mordor! ' he muttered under his breath. 'if i must go there i wish i could come there quickly and make an end! ' he shuddered. the wind was chilly and yet heavy with an odour of cold decay. `well,' he said, at last withdrawing his eyes, `we cannot stay here all night, fix or no fix. we must find a more sheltered spot, and camp once more; and perhaps another day will show us a path.'
'or another and another and another,' muttered sam. `or maybe no day. we've come the wrong way.'
'i wonder,' said frodo. 'it's my doom, i think, to go to that shadow yonder, so that a way will be found. but will good or evil show it to me? what hope we had was in speed. delay plays into the enemy's hands-and here i am: delayed. is it the will of the dark tower that steers us? all my choices have proved ill. i should have left the company long before, and come down from the north, east of the river and of the emyn muil, and so over the hard of b

'only those, what d'you call 'em, lembas, mr. frodo. a fair supply. but they are better than naught, by a long bite. i never thought, though, when i first set tooth in them, that i should ever come to wish for a change. but i do now: a bit of plain bread, and a mug - aye, half a mug - of beer would go down proper. i've lugged my cooking-gear all the way from the last camp, and what use has it been? naught to make a fire with, for a

they turned away and went down into a stony hollow. the westering sun was caught into clouds, and night came swiftly. they slept as well as they could for the cold, turn and turn about, in a nook among great jagged pinnacles of weathered rock; at least they were sheltered from the easterly wind.
`did you see them again, mr. frodo?' asked sam, as they sat, stiff and chilled, munching wafers of lembas, in the cold grey of early morning.
'no,' said frodo. `i've heard nothing, and seen nothing, for two nights now.'
`nor me,' said sam. `grrr! those eyes did give me a turn! but perhaps we've shaken him off at last, the miserable slinker. gollum! i'll give him gollum in his throat, if ever i get my hands on his neck.'
'i hope you'll never need to,' said frodo. `i don't know how he followed us; but it may be that he's lost us again, as you

'i hope that's the way of it,' said sam. 'i wish we could be rid of him for good!'
'so do i,' said frodo; 'but he's not my chief trouble. i wish we could get away from these hills! i hate them. i feel all naked on the east side, stuck up here with nothing but the dead flats between me and that shadow yonder. there's an eye in it. come on! we've got to get down today somehow.'
but that day wore on, and when afternoon faded towards evening they were still scrambling along the ridge and had found no way of escape.

sighing over the edges of the stones - yet even that reminded them of breath softly hissing through sharp teeth.
all that day the outer ridge of the emyn muil had been bending gradually northward, as they struggled on. along its brink there now stretched a wide tumbled flat of scored and weathered rock, cut every now and again by trench-like gullies that sloped steeply down to deep notches in the cliff-face. to find a path in these clefts, which were becoming deeper and more frequent, frodo and sam were driven to their left, well away from the edge, and they did not notice that for several miles they had been going slowly but steadily downhill: the cliff-top was sinking towards the level of the lowlands.
at last they were brought to a halt. the ridge took a sharper bend northward and was gashed by a deeper ravine. on the further side it reared up again, many fathoms at a single leap: a great grey cliff loomed before them, cut sheer down as if by a knife stroke. they could go no further fo

rwards, and must turn now either west or east. but west would lead them only into more labour and delay, back towards the heart of the hills; east would take them to the outer precipice.
`there's nothing for it but to scramble down this gully, sam,' said frodo. `let's see what it leads to!'
'a nasty drop, i'll bet,' said sam.
the cleft was longer and deeper than it seemed. some way down they found a few gnarled and stunted trees, the first they had seen for days: twisted birch for the most part, with here and there a fir-tree. many were dead and gaunt, bitten to the core by the eastern winds. once in milder days there must have been a fair thicket in the ravine, but now, after some fifty yards, the trees came to an end, though old broken stumps straggled on almost to the cliff's brink. the bottom of the gully, whic

`look!' he said. `we must have come down a long way, or else the cliff has sunk. it's much lower here than it was, and it looks easier too.'
sam knelt beside him and peered reluctantly over the edge. then he glanced up at the great cliff rising up, away on their left. `easier! ' he grunted. `well, i suppose it's always easier getting down than up. those as can't fly can jump!'
`it would be a big jump still,' said frodo. `about, well' - he stood for a moment measuring it with his eyes - `about eighteen fathoms i should guess. not more.'
'and that's enough! ' said sam. `ugh! how i do hate looking down from a height! but looking's better t

the outer fall was indeed no longer sheer, but sloped outwards a little. it looked like a great rampart or sea-wall whose foundations had shifted, so that its courses were all twisted and disordered, leaving great fissures and long slanting edges that were in places almost as wide as stairs.
`and if we're going to try an

the smoky blur of the mountains in the east was lost in a deeper blackness that was already reaching out westwards with long arms. there was a distant mutter of thunder borne on the rising breeze. frodo sniffed the air and looked up doubtfully at the sky. he strapped his belt outside his cloak and tightened it, and settled his light pack on his back; then he stepped towards the edge. `i'm going to try it,' he said.
`very good! ' said sam gloomily. `but i'm going first.'
'you? ' said frodo. `what's made you change your mind about climbing?'
'i haven't changed my mind. but it's only sense: put the one lowest as is most likely to slip. i don't want to come down atop of you and knock you off no sense in killing two with one fall.'
before frodo could stop him, he sat down, swung his legs over the brink, and twisted round, scrabbling with his toes for a foothold. it is doubtful if he ever did anything braver in cold blood, or more un

'no, no! sam, you old ass! ' said frodo. `you'll kill yourself for certain going over like that without even a look to see what to make for. come back! ' he took sam under the armpits and hauled him up again. 'now, wait a bit and be patient! ' he said. then he lay on the ground, leaning out and looking down: but the light seemed to be fading quickly, although the sun had not yet set. 'i think we could manage this,' he said presently. `i could at any rate; and you could too. if you kept your head and followed me carefully.'
`i don't know how you can be so sure,' said sam. `why! you can't see to the bottom in this light. what if you comes to a place where the

'climb back, i suppose,' said frodo.
'easy said,' objected sam. 'better wait till morning and more light.'
`no! not if i can help it,' said frodo with a sudden strange vehemence. `i grudge every hour, every minute. i'm going down to try it out. don't you follow till i come back or call!'
gripping the stony lip of the fall with his fingers he let himself gently down, until when his arms were almost at full stretch, his toes found a ledge. 'on_ e step down! ' he said. 'and this ledge broadens out to the right. i could stand there without a hold. i'll-' his w

. there was a dry splitting crack of thunder right overhead. searing lightning smote down into the hills. then came a blast of savage wind, and with it, mingling with its roar, there came a high shrill shriek. the hobbits had heard just such a cry far away in the marish as they fled from hobbiton, and even there in the woods of the shire it had frozen their blood. out here in the waste its terror was far greater: it pierced them with cold blades of horror and despair, stopping heart and breath. sam fell flat on his face. involuntarily frodo loosed his hold and put his hands over his head and ears. he swayed, slipped, and slithered downwards with a wailing cry.
sam heard him and crawled with an effort to the edge. 'master, master! ' he called. 'master!'.
he heard no answer. he found he was shaking all over, but he gathered his breath, and once again he shouted: 'master!' the wind seemed to blow his voice back into his throat, but as it passed, roaring up the gully and away over the hills,

t to his feet on a wider ledge not many yards lower down. fortunately the rock-face at this point leaned well back and the wind had pressed him against the cliff, so that he had not toppled over. he steadied himself a little, laying his face against the cold stone, feeling his heart pounding. but either the darkness had grown complete, or else his eyes had lost their sight. all was black about him. he wondered if he had been struck blind. he took a deep breath.
`come back! come back! ' he heard sam's voice out of the blackness above.
`i can't,' he said. `i can't see. i can't find any hold. i can't move yet.'
`what can i do, mr. frodo? what can i do? ' shouted sam, leaning out dangerously far. why could not his master see? it was dim, certainly, but not as dark as all that. he could see frodo below him, a grey forlorn figure splayed against the cliff. but he was far out of the reach of any helping hand.
there was another crack of thunder; and then the rain came. in a blinding sheet, mingle

d with hail, it drove against the cliff, bitter cold.
'i'm coming down to you,' shouted sam, though how he hoped to help in that way he could not have said.
`no, no! wait! ' frodo called back, more strongly now. `i shall be better soon. i feel better already. wait! you can't do anything without a rope.'
`rope!' cried sam, talking wildly to himself in his excitement and relief. `well, if i don't deserve to be hung on the end of one as a warning to numbskulls! you're nowt but a ninnyhammer, sam gamgee: that's what the gaffer said to me often enough, it being a word of his. rope!'
`stop chattering!' cried frodo, now recovered enough to feel both amused and annoyed. 'never mind your gaffer! are you trying to tell yourself you've got some rope in your pocket? if so, out with it!
`yes, mr. frodo, in my pack and all. carried it hundreds of miles and i'd clean forgotten it!'
`then get busy and let an end down!'
quickly sam unslung his pack and rummaged in it. there indeed at the bottom was

a coil of the silken-grey rope made by the folk of lórien. he cast an end to his master. the darkness seemed to lift from frodo's eyes, or else his sight was returning. he could see the grey line as it came dangling down, and he thought it had a faint silver sheen. now that he had some point in the darkness to fix his eyes on, he felt less giddy. leaning his weight forward, he made the end fast round his waist, and then he grasped the line with both hands.
sam stepped back and braced his feet against a stump a yard or two from the edge. half hauled, half scrambling. frodo came up and threw himself on the ground.
thunder growled and rumbled in the distance, and the rain was still falling heavily. the hobbits crawled away back into the gully; but they did not find much shelter there. rills of water began to run down; soon they grew to a spate that splashed and fumed on the stones, and spouted out over the cliff like the gutters of a vast roof.

`better luck if i'd thought of it sooner,' said sam. 'maybe you remember them putting the ropes in the boats, as we started off: in the elvish country. i took a fancy to it, and i stowed a coil in my pack. years ago, it seems. "it may be a help in many needs," he said: haldir, or one of those folk. and he spoke right.'
`a pity i didn't think of bringing another length,' said frodo; `but i left the company in such a hurry and confusion. if only we had enough we could use it to get down. how long is your rope, i wonder?'
sam paid it out slowly, me

asuring it with his arms: 'five, ten, twenty, thirty ells, more or less,' he said.
'who'd have thought it!' frodo exclaimed.
`ah! who would? ' said sam. `elves are wonderful folk. it looks a bit thin, but it's tough; and soft as milk to the hand. packs close too, and as light as light. wonderful folk to be sure!'
`thirty ells! ' said frodo considering. 'i believe it would be enough. if the storm passes before nightfall, i'm going to try it.'
`the rain's nearly given over already,' said sam; 'but don't you go doing anything risky in the dim again, mr. frodo! and i haven't got over that shriek on the wind yet, if you have. like a black rider it sounded-but one up in the air, if they can fly. i'm thinking we'd best lay up in this crack till night's over.'
'and i'm thinking that i won't spend a moment longer than i need stuck up on this edge with the eyes of the dark country looking over the marshes,' said frodo.
with that he stood up and went down to the bottom of the gully again. h

, over the desert and the reeking marshes the deep blue sky of evening opened once more, and a few pallid stars appeared, like small white holes in the canopy above the crescent moon.
`it's good to be able to see again,' said frodo, breathing deep. `do you know, i thought for a bit that i had lost my sight? from the lightning or something else worse. i could see nothing, nothing at all, until the grey rope came down. it seemed to shimmer somehow.'
`it does look sort of silver in the dark,' said sam. `never noticed it before, though i can't remember as i've ever had it out since i first stowed it. but if you're so set on climbing, mr. frodo, how are you going to use it? thirty ells, or say, about eighteen fathom: that's no more than your guess at the height of the cliff.'
frodo thought for a while. `make it fast to that stump, sam! ' he said. `then i think you shall have your wish this time and go first. i'll lower you, and you need do no more than use your feet and hands to fend yourself

off the rock. though, if you put your weight on some of the ledges and give me a rest, it will help. when you're down, i'll follow. i feel quite myself again now.'
'very well,' said sam heavily. `if it must be, let's get it over! ' he took up the rope and made it fast over the stump nearest to the brink; then the other end he tied about his own waist. reluctantly he turned and prepared to go over the edge a second time.
it did not, however, turn out half as bad as he had expected. the rope seemed to give him confidence, though he shut his eyes more than once when he looked down between his feet. there was one awkward spot, where there was no ledge and the wall was sheer and ev

en undercut for a short space; there he slipped and swung out on the silver line. but frodo lowered him slowly and steadily, and it was over at last. his chief fear had been that the rope-length would give out while he was still high up, but there was still a good bight in frodo's hands, when sam came to the bottom and called up: `i'm down! ' his voice came up clearly from below, but frodo could not see him; his grey elven-cloak had melted into the twilight.
frodo took rather more time to follow him. he had the rope about his waist and it was fast above, and he had shortened it so that it would pull him up before he reached the ground; still he did not want to risk a fall, and he had not quite sam's faith in this slender grey line. he found two places, all the same, where he had to trus

`well!' he cried. `we've done it! we've escaped from the emyn muil! and now what next, i wonder? maybe we shall soon be sighing for good hard rock under foot again.'
but sam did not answer: he was staring back up the cliff. `ninnyhammers! ' he said. `noodles! my beautiful rope! there it is tied to a stump, and we're at the bottom. just as nice a little stair for that slinking gollum as we could leave. better put up a signpost to say which way we've gone! i thought it seemed a bit too easy.'
`if you can think of any way we could have both used the rope and yet brought it down with us, then you can pass on to me ninnyhammer, or any other name your gaffer gave you,' s

aid frodo. `climb up and untie it and let yourself down, if you want to!'
sam scratched his head. `no, i can't think how, begging your pardon,' he said. `but i don't like leaving it, and that's a fact.' he stroked the rope's end and shook it gently. `it goes hard parting with anything i brought out of the elf-country. made by galadriel herself, too, maybe. galadriel,' he murmured nodding his head mournfully. he looked up and gave one last pull to the rope as if in farewell.
to the complete surprise of both the hobbits it came loose. sam fell over, and the long grey coils

 slithered silently down on top of him. frodo laughed. `who tied the rope? ' he said. `a good thing it held as long as it did! to think that i trusted all my weight to your knot!'
sam did not laugh. `i may not be much good at climbing, mr. frodo,' he said in injured tones, `but i do know something about rope and about knots. it's in the family, as you might say. why, my grand-dad, and my uncle andy after him, him that was the gaffer's eldest brother he had a rope-walk over by tighfield many a year. and i put as fast a hitch over the stump as any one could have done, in the shire or out of it.'
`then the rope must have broken - frayed on the rock-edge, i expect,' said frodo.

`i bet it didn't! ' said sam in an even more injured voice. he stooped and examined the ends. `nor it hasn't neither. not a strand!'
'then i'm afraid it must have been the knot,' said frodo.
sam shook his head and did not answer. he was passing the rope through his fingers thoughtfully. `have it your own way, mr. frodo,' he said at last, `but i think the rope came off itself - when i called.' he coiled it up and stowed it lovingly in his pack.
'it certainly came,' said frodo, `and that's the chief thing. but now we've got to think of our next move. night will be on us soon. how beautiful the stars are, and the moon!'
'they do cheer the heart, don't they? ' said sam looking up. 'elvish

'yes,' said frodo; `but he won't be full for some days. i don't think we'll try the marshes by the light of half a moon.'
under the first shadows of night they started out on the next stage of their journey. after a while sam turned and looked back at the way they had come. the mouth of the gully was a black notch in the dim cliff. `i'm glad we've got the rope,' he said. 'we've set a little puzzle for that footpad, anyhow. he can try his nasty flappy feet on those ledges!'
they picked their steps away from the skirts of the cliff, among a wilderness of boulders and rough stones, wet and slippery with the heavy rain. the ground still fell away sharply. they had not gone very far when they came upon a great fissure th

at yawned suddenly black before their feet. it was not wide, but it was too wide to jump across in the dim light. they thought they could hear water gurgling in its depths. it curved away on their left northward, back towards the hills. and so barred their road in that direction, at any rate while darkness lasted.
'we had better try a way back southwards along the line of the cliff, i think,' said sam. `we might find some nook there, or even a cave or something.'
'i suppose so,' said frodo. 'i'm tired. and i don't think i can scramble among stones much longer tonight - though i grudge the delay. i wish there was a clear path in front of us: then i'd go on till my legs gave way.'
they did not find the going any easier at the broken feet of the emyn muil. nor did sam find any nook or hollow to shelter in: only bare stony slopes frowned over by the cliff, which now rose again, higher and more s

t of the precipice. there for some time they sat huddled mournfully together in the cold stony night, while sleep crept upon them in spite of all they could do to hold it off. the moon now rode high and clear. its thin white light lit up the faces of the rocks and drenched the cold frowning walls of the cliff, turning all the wide looming darkness into a chill pale grey scored with black shadows.
'well! ' said frodo, standing up and drawing his cloak more closely round him. `you sleep for a bit sam and take my blanket. i'll walk up and down on sentry for a while.' suddenly he stiffened, and stooping he gripped sam by the arm. `what's that? ' he whispered. `look over there on the cliff!'
sam looked and breathed in sharply through his teeth. `ssss!' he said. 'that's what it is. it's that gollum! snakes and adders! and to think that i thought that we'd puzzle him with our bit of a climb! look at him! like a nasty crawling spider on a wall.'

olds that no hobbit could ever have seen or used, but it looked as if it was just creeping down on sticky pads, like some large prowling thing of insect-kind. and it was coming down head first, as if it was smelling its way. now and again it lifted its head slowly, turning it right back on its long skinny neck, and the hobbits caught a glimpse of two small pale gleaming lights, its eyes that blinked at the moon for a moment and then were quickly lidded again.
`do you think he can see us? ' said sam.
`i don't know,' said frodo quietly, `but i think not. it is hard even for friendly eyes to see these elven-cloaks: i cannot see you in the shadow even at a few paces. and i've heard that he doesn't like sun or moon.'
`then why is he coming down just here? ' asked sam.
'quietly, sam! ' said frodo. `he can smell us, perhaps. and he can hear as keen as elves, i believe. i think he has heard something now: our voices probably. we did a lot of shouting away back there; and we were talking far too l

`well, i'm sick of him,' said sam. `he's come once too often for me and i'm going to have a word with him, if i can. i don't suppose we could give him the slip now anyway.' drawing his grey hood well over his face, sam crept stealthily towards the cliff.
`careful!' whispered frodo coming behind. `don't alarm him! he's much more dangerous than he looks.'
the black crawling shape was now three-quarters of the way down, and perhaps fifty feet or less above the cliff's foot. crouching stone-still in the shadow of a large boulder the hobbits watched him. he seemed to have come to a difficult passage or to be troubled about something. they could hear him snuffling, and now and again there was a harsh hiss of breath

he was getting lower now and the hisses became sharper and clearer. 'where iss it, where iss it: my precious, my precious? it's ours, it is, and we wants it. the thieves, the thieves, the filthy little thieves. where are they with my precious? curse them! we hates them.'
`it doesn't sound as if he knew we were here, does it? ' whispered sam. `and what's his precious? does he mean the'

indeed gollum had suddenly paused again, and his large head on its scrawny neck was lolling from side to side as if he was listening. his pale eyes were half unlidded. sam restrained himself, though his fingers were twitching. his eyes, filled with anger and disgust, were fixed on the wretched creature as he now began to move again, still whispering and hissing to himself

.
at last he was no more than a dozen feet from the ground, right above their heads. from that point there was a sheer drop, for the cliff was slightly undercut, and even gollum could not find a hold of any kind. he seemed to be trying to twist round, so as to go legs first, when suddenly with a shrill whistling shriek he fell. as he did so, he curled his legs and arms up round him, like a spider whose descending thread is snapped.
sam was out of his hiding in a flash and crossed the space between him and the cliff foot in a couple of leaps. before gollum could get up, he was on top of him. but he found gollum more than he bargained for, even taken like that, suddenly, off his guard after a fall. before sam could get a hold, long legs and arms were wound round him pinning his arms, and a clinging grip, soft but horribly strong, was squeezing him like slowly tightening cords; clammy fingers were feeling for his throat. then sh

things would have gone ill with sam, if he had been alone. but frodo sprang up, and drew sting from its sheath. with his left hand he drew back gollum's head by his thin lank hair, stretching his long neck, and forcing his pale venomous eyes to stare up at the sky.
`let go! gollum,' he said. `this is sting. you have seen it before once upon a time. let go, or you'll feel it this time! i'll cut your throat.'
gollum collapsed and went as loose as wet string. sam got up, fingering his shoulder. his eyes smouldered with anger, but he

 could not avenge himself: his miserable enemy lay grovelling on the stones whimpering.
`don't hurt us! don't let them hurt us, precious! they won't hurt us will they, nice little hobbitses? we didn't mean no harm, but they jumps on us like cats on poor mices, they did, precious. and we're so lonely, gollum. we'll be nice to them, very nice, if they'll be nice to us, won't we, yes, yess.'
`well, what's to be done with it? ' said sam. `tie it up, so as it can't come sneaking after us no more, i say.'
`but that would kill us, kill us,' whimpered gollum. `cruel little hobbitses. tie us up in the cold hard lands and leave us, gollum, gollum.' sobs welled up in his gobbling throat.
`no,' said frodo. `if we kill him, we must kill him outright. but we can't do that, not as things are. poor wretch! he has done us no harm.'
`oh hasn't he! ' said sam rubbing his shoulder. `anyway he meant to, and he means to, i'll warrant. throttle

'i daresay,' said frodo. `but what he means to do is another matter.' he paused for a while in thought. gollum lay still, but stopped whimpering. sam stood glowering over him.
it seemed to frodo then that he heard, quite plainly but far off, voices out of the past:
what a pity bilbo did not stub the vile creature, when he had a chance!
pity? it was pity that stayed his hand. pity, and mercy: not to strike without need.

sam stared at his master, who seemed to be speaking to some one who was not there. gollum lifted his head.
'yess, wretched we are, precious,' he whined. 'misery misery! hobbits won't kill us, nice hobbits.'
'no, we won't,' said frodo. `but we won't let you go, either. you're full of wickedness and mischief, gollum. you will have to come with us, that's all, while we keep an eye on you. but you must help us, if you can. one good turn deserves another.'
'yess, yes indeed,' said gollum sitting up. 'ni

sam scowled at him, and sucked his teeth; but he seemed to sense that there was something odd about his master's mood and that the matter was beyond argument. all the same he was amazed at frodo's reply.
frodo looked straight into gollum's eyes which flinched and twisted away. `you know that, or you guess well enough, sméagol,' he said. quietly and sternly. `we are going to mordor, of course. and you know the way there, i believe.'
`ach! sss! ' said gollum, covering his ears with his hands, as if such frankness, and the open speaking of the names, hurt him. `we guessed, yes we guessed,' he whispered; `and we didn't want them to go, did we? no, precious, not the

side. with their backs to the stony wall, resting their legs. there was no need for any arrangement by word: they knew that they must not sleep for a moment. slowly the moon went by. shadows fell down from the hills, and all grew dark before them. the stars grew thick and bright in the sky above. no one stirred. gollum sat with his legs drawn up, knees under chin, flat hands and feet splayed on the ground, his eyes closed; but he seemed tense, as if thinking or listening.
frodo looked across at sam. their eyes met and they understood. they relaxed, leaning their heads back, and shutting their eyes or seeming to. soon the sound of their soft breathing could be heard. gollum's hands twitched a little. hardly perceptibly his head moved to the left and the right, and first one eye and then the other opened a slit. the hobbits made no sign.
suddenly, with startling agility and speed, straight off the ground with a jump like a grasshopper or a frog. gollum bounded forward into the darkness. but

 that was just what frodo and sam had expected. sam was on him before he had gone two paces after his spring. frodo coming behind grabbed his leg and threw him.
'your rope might prove useful again, sam.' he said.
sam got out the rope. 'and where were you off to in the cold hard lands, mr. gollum?' he growled. 'we wonders. aye, we wonders. to find some of your orc-friends, i warrant. you nasty treacherous creature. it's round your neck this rope ought to go, and a tight noose too.'
gollum lay quiet and tried no further tricks. he did not answer sam, but gave him a swift venomous look.
`all we need is something to keep a hold on him,' said frodo. 'we want him to walk, so it's no good tying his legs-or his arm

s. he seems to use them nearly as much. tie one end to his ankle, and keep a grip on the other end.'
he stood over gollum, while sam tied the knot. the result surprised them both. gollum began to scream, a thin, tearing sound, very horrible to hear. he writhed, and tried to get his mouth to his ankle and bite the rope. he kept on screaming.
at last frodo was convinced that he really was in pain; but it could not be from the knot. he examined it and found that it was not too tight, indeed hardly tight enough. sam was gentler than his words. 'what's the matter with you? ' he said. `if you will try to run away. you must be tied

`no, i will not take it off you,' said frodo, `not unless' - he paused a moment in thought - `not unless there is any promise you can make that i can trust.'
'we will swear to do what he wants, yes, yess, said gollum, still twisting and grabbling at his ankle. `it hurts us.'
`swear? ' said frodo.
'sméagol,' said gollum suddenly and clearly, opening his eyes wide and staring at frodo with a strange light. 'sméagol will swear on the precious.'
frodo drew himself up, and again sam was startled by his words and his stern voice. 'on the precious? how dare you? ' he said. 'think!
one ring to rule them all and in the darkness bind them.
would you commit your promise to that, sméagol? it will hold you. but it is more treacherous than you are. it may twist your words. beware!'
gollum cowered. 'on the precious. on the precious! ' he repeated.
`and what would you swear? ' asked frodo.
`to be very very good,' said gollum. then crawling to frodo's feet he grovelled before him, wh

ng hoarsely: a shudder ran over him, as if the words shook his very bones with fear. 'sméagol will swear never, never, to let him have it. never! sméagol will save it. but he must swear on the precious.'
'no! not on it,' said frodo, looking down at him with stern pity. 'all you wish is to see it and touch it, if you can, though you know it would drive you mad. not on it. swear by it, if you will. for you know where it is. yes, you know, sméagol. it is before you.'
for a moment it appeared to sam that his master had grown and gollum had shrunk: a tall stern shadow, a mighty lord who hid his brightness in grey cloud, and at his feet a little whining dog. yet the two were in some way akin and not alien: they could reach one another's minds. gollum raised himself and began pawing at frodo, fawning at his knees.
'down! down! ' said frodo. `now speak your promise!'
`we promises, yes i promise!' said gollum. 'i will serve the master of the precious. good master, good sméagol, gollum, gollum!

' suddenly he began to weep and bite at his ankle again.
'take the rope off, sam!' said frodo.
reluctantly sam obeyed. at once gollum got up and began prancing about, like a whipped cur whose master has patted it. from that moment a change, which lasted for some time, came over him. he spoke with less hissing and whining, and he spoke to his companions direct, not to his precious self. he would cringe and flinch, if they stepped near him or made any sudden movement, and he avoided the touch of their elven-cloaks; but he was friendly, and indeed pitifully anxious to please. he would cackle with laughter

and caper, if any jest was made, or even if frodo spoke kindly to him, and weep if frodo rebuked him. sam said little to him of any sort. he suspected him more deeply than ever, and if possible liked the new gollum, the sméagol, less than the old.
'well, gollum, or whatever it is we're to call you,' he said. 'now for it! the moon's gone. and the night's going. we'd better start.'
'yes, yes,' agreed gollum, skipping about. 'off we go! there's only one way across between the north-end and the south-end. i found it, i did. orcs don't use it, orcs don't know it. orcs don't cross the marshes, they go r

he took a few steps away and looked back inquiringly, like a dog inviting them for a walk. 'wait a bit, gollum!' cried sam. `not too far ahead now! i'm going to be at your tail, and i've got the rope handy.'
'no, no! ' said gollum. 'sméagol promised.'
in the deep of night under hard clear stars they set off. gollum led them back northward for a while along the way they had come; then he slanted to the right away from the steep edge of the emyn muil, down the broken stony slopes towards the vast fens below. they faded swiftly and softly into the darkness. over all the leagues of waste before the gates of mordor the

chapter 2

the passage of the marshes

gollum moved quickly, with his head and neck thrust forward, often using his hands as well as his feet. frodo and sam were hard put to it to keep up with him; but he seemed no longer to have any thought of escaping, and if they fell behind, he would turn and wait for them. after a time he brought them to the brink of the narrow gully that they had struck before; but they were now further from the hills.
`here it is!' he cried. 'there is a way down inside, yes. now we follows it - out, out away over there.' he pointed south and east towards the marshes. the reek of them came to their nostrils, heavy and foul ev

they gnaws our feet.

all bare of meat.
but stream and pool

so nice for feet!
and now we wish -
'ha! ha! what does we wish?' he said, looking sidelong at the hobbits. 'we'll tell you.' he croaked. `he guessed it long ago, baggins guessed it.' a glint came into his eyes, and sam catching the gleam in the darkness thought it far from pleasant.

as cold as death;

so sleek, so fair!
what a joy to meet!

these words only made more pressing to sam's mind a problem that had been troubling him from the moment when he understood that hir master was going to adopt g

ollum as a guide: the problem of food. it did not occur to him that his master might also have thought of it. hut he supposed gollum had. indeed how had gollum kept himself in all his lonely wandering? 'not too well,' thought sam. 'he looks fair famished. not too dainty to try what hobbit tastes like if there ain't no fish, i'll wager - supposing as he could catch us napping. well, he won't: not sam gamgee for one.'
they stumbled along in the dark winding gully for a long time, or so it seemed to the tired feet of frodo and sam. the gully turned eastward, and as they went on it broadened and got gradually shallower. at last the sky above grew faint with the first grey of morning. gollum had shown no signs of tiring, but now he looked up and halted.
`day is near,' he whispered, as if day was something that might overhear him and spring on him. `sméagol will stay here: i will stay here, and

are too tired to go any further at present.'
`you are not wise to be glad of the yellow face,' said gollum. `it shows you up. nice sensible hobbits stay with sméagol. orcs and nasty things are about. they can see a long way. stay and hide with me! '
the three of them settled down to rest at the foot of the rocky wall of the gully. it was not much more than a tall man's height now, and at its base there were wide flat shelves of dry stone; the water ran in a channel on the other side. frodo and sam sat on one of the flats, resting their backs. gollum paddled and scrabbled in the stream.
`we must take a little food,' said frodo. `are you hungry, sméagol? we have very little to share, but we will spare you what we can.'
at the word hungry a greenish light was kindled in gollum's pale eyes, and they seemed to protrude further than ever from his thin sickly face. for a moment he relapsed into his old gollum-manner. 'we are famisshed, yes famisshed we are. precious,' he said. `what is it they

 and a fit of coughing shook him.
`ach! no! ' he spluttered. `you try to choke poor sméagol. dust and ashes, he can't eat that. he must starve. but sméagol doesn't mind. nice hobbits! sméagol has promised. he will starve. he can't eat hobbits' food. he will starve. poor thin sméagol! '
`i'm sorry,' said frodo; `but i can't help you, i'm afraid. i think this food would do you good, if you would try. but perhaps you can't even try, not yet anyway.'
the hobbits munched their lembas in silence. sam thought that it tasted far better, somehow, than it had for a good while: gollum's behaviour had made him attend to its flavour again. but he did not feel comfortable. gollum watched every morsel from hand to mouth, like an expectant dog by a diner's chair. only when they had finished and were preparing to rest, was he apparently convinced that they had no hidden dainties that he could share in. then he went and sat by himself a few paces away and whimpered a little.
'look here! ' sam whispered

 to frodo, not too softly: he did not really care whether gollum heard him or not. `we've got to get some sleep; but not both together with that hungry villain nigh, promise or no promise. sméagol or gollum, he won't change his habits in a hurry, i'll warrant. you go to sleep, mr. frodo, and i'll call you when i can't keep my eyelids propped up. turn and about, same as before, while he's loose.'
'perhaps you're right, sam,' said frodo speaking openly. 'there is a change in him, but just what kind of a change and how deep, i'm not sure yet. seriously though, i don't think there is any need for fear - at present. still watch if you wish. give me about two hours, not more, and then call me.'
so tired was frodo that his head fell forward on his breast and he slept. almost as soon as he had spoken the words. gollum seemed no longer to have any fears. he curled up and went quickly to sleep, quite unconcerned. presentl

y his breath was hissing softly through his clenched teeth, hut he lay still as stone. after a while, fearing that he would drop off himself, if he sat listening to his two companions breathing, sam got up and gently prodded gollum. his hands uncurled and twitched, but he made no other movement. sam bent down and said fissh close to his ear, but there was no response, not even a catch in gollum's breathing.
sam scratched his head. `must really be asleep,' he muttered. `and if i was like gollum, he wouldn't wake up never again.' he restrained the thoughts of his sword and the rope that sprang to his mind, and went and sat down by his master.
when he woke up the sky above was dim, not lighter but darker than when they had breakfasted. sam leapt to his feet. not least from his own feeling of vigour and hunger, he suddenly understood that he had slept the daylight away, nine hours at least. frodo was stil

l fast asleep, lying now stretched on his side. gollum was not to be seen. various reproachful names for himself came to sam's mind, drawn from the gaffer's large paternal word-hoard; then it also occurred to him that his master had been right: there had for the present been nothing to guard against. they were at any rate both alive and unthrottled.
'poor wretch! ' he said half remorsefully. 'now i wonder where he's got to? '
'not far, not far! ' said a voice above him. he looked up and saw the shape of gollum's large head and ears against the evening sky.
'here, what are you doing? ' cried sam, his suspicions coming

 back as soon as he saw that shape.
`sméagol is hungry,' said gollum. `be back soon.'
'come back now!' shouted sam. 'hi! come back!' but gollum had vanished.
frodo woke at the sound of sam's shout and sat up, rubbing his eyes. 'hullo!' he said. 'anything wrong? what's the time?'
'i dunno,' said sam. 'after sundown, i reckon. and he's gone off. says he's hungry.'
`don't worry!' said frodo. `there's no help for it. but he'll come back, you'll see. the promise will hold yet a while. and he won't leave his precious, anyway.'
frodo made light of it when he learned that they had slept soundly for hours with gollum, and a very hungry gollum too, loose beside them. `don't think of any of your gaffer's hard names,' he said. 'you were worn out, and it has turned out well: we are now both rested. an

`about the food,' said sam. 'how long's it going to take us to do this job? and when it's done, what are we going to do then? this waybread keeps you on your legs in a wonderful way, though it doesn't satisfy the innards proper, as you might say: not to my feeling anyhow, meaning no disrespect to them as made it. but you have to eat some of it every day, and it doesn't grow. i reckon we've got enough to last, say, three weeks or so, and that with a tight belt and a light tooth, mind you. we've been a bit free with it so

far.'
`i don't know how long we shall take to - to finish,' said frodo. `we were miserably delayed in the hills. but samwise gamgee, my dear hobbit - indeed, sam my dearest hobbit, friend of friends - i do not think we need give thought to what comes after that. to do the job as you put it - what hope is there that we ever shall? and if we do, who knows what will come of that? if the one goes into the fire, and we are at hand? i ask you, sam, are we ever likely to need bread again? i think not. if we can nurse our limbs to bring us to mount doom, that is all we can do. more than i can, i begin to feel.'
sam nodded silently. he took his master's hand and bent over it. he did not kiss it, though his tears fell on it. then he turned away, drew his sleeve over his nose, and got up, and stamped about, trying to whistle, and saying between the efforts: 'where's that dratted creature?'
it was actually not long before gollum returned; but

he came so quietly that they did not hear him till he stood before them. his fingers and face were soiled with black mud. he was still chewing and slavering. what he was chewing, they did not ask or like to think.
'worms or beetles or something slimy out of holes,' thought sam. 'brr! the nasty creature; the poor wretch! '
gollum said nothing to them, until he had drunk deeply and washed himself in the stream. then he came up to them, licking his lips. 'better now,' he said. `are we rested? ready to go on? nice hobbits, they sleep beautifully. trust sméagol now? very, very good.'
the next stage of their journey was much the same as the last. as they went on the gully became ever shallower and the slope of its floor more gradual. its bottom was less stony and more ear

ay go a long way. quite a long way, before he catches you, yes perhaps.'
it was already day, a windless and sullen morning, and the marsh-reeks lay in heavy banks. no sun pierced the low clouded sky, and gollum seemed anxious to continue the journey at once. so after a brief rest they set out again and were soon lost in a shadowy silent world, cut off from all view of the lands about, either the hills that they had left or the mountains that they sought. they went slowly in single file: gollum, sam, frodo.
frodo seemed the most weary of the three, and slow though they went. he often lagged. the hobbits soon found that what had looked like one vast fen was really an endless network of pools, and soft mires. and winding half-strangled water-courses. among these a cunning eye and foot could thread a wandering path. gollum certainly had that cunning, and needed all of it. his head on its long neck was ever turning this way and that, while he sniffed and muttered all the time to himself. somet

only a passing ghost of her could they see below, bleared, pale, giving no colour and no warmth. but even at this faint reminder of her presence gollum scowled and flinched. he halted their journey, and they rested, squatting like little hunted animals, in the borders of a great brown reed-thicket. there was a deep silence, only scraped on its surfaces by the faint quiver of empty seed-plumes, and broken grass-blades trembling in small air-movements that they could not feel.
'not a bird! ' said sam mournfully.
`no, no birds,' said gollum. `nice birds! ' he licked his teeth. 'no birds here. there are snakeses, wormses, things in the pools. lots of things, lots of nasty things. no birds,' he ended sadly. sam looked at him with distaste.
so passed the third day of their journey with gollum. before the shadows of evening were long in happier lands, they went on again, always on and on with only brief halts. these they made not so much for rest as to help gollum; for now even he had to go forw

 and it was dark.
they walked slowly, stooping, keeping close in line, following attentively every move that gollum made. the fens grew more wet, opening into wide stagnant meres, among which it grew more and more difficult to find the firmer places where feet could tread without sinking into gurgling mud. the travellers were light, or maybe none of them would ever have found a way through.
presently it grew altogether dark: the air itself seemed black and heavy to breathe. when lights appeared sam rubbed his eyes: he thought his head was going queer. he first saw one with the corner of his left eye, a wisp of pale sheen that faded away; but others appeared soon after: some like dimly shining smoke, some like misty flames flickering slowly above unseen candles; here and there they twisted like ghostly sheets unfurled by hidden hands. but neither of his companions spoke a word.
at last sam could bear it no longer. `what's all this, gollum? ' he said in a whisper. `these lights? they're all
 
 ___________________________
 
 round us now. are we trapped? who are they? '
gollum looked up. a dark water was before him, and he was crawling on the ground, this way and that, doubtful of the way. 'yes, they are all round us,' he whispered. 'the tricksy lights. candles of corpses, yes, yes. don't you heed them! don't look! don't follow them! where's the master? '
sam looked back and found that frodo had lagged again. he could not see him. he went some paces back into the darkness, not daring to move far, or to call in more than a hoarse whisper. suddenly he stumbled against frodo, who was standing lost in thought, looking at the pale lights. his hands hung stiff at his sides; water and slime were dripping from them.
`come, mr. frodo! ' said sam. 'don't look at them! gollum says we mustn't. let's keep up with him and get out of this cursed place as quick as

we can - if we can! '
`all right,' said frodo, as if returning out of a dream. 'i'm coming. go on! '
hurrying forward again, sam tripped, catching his foot in some old root or tussock. he fell and came heavily on his hands, which sank deep into sticky ooze, so that his face was brought close to the surface of the dark mere. there was a faint hiss, a noisome smell went up, the lights flickered and danced and swirled. for a moment the water below him looked like some window, glazed with grimy glass, through which he was peering. wrenching his hands out of the bog, he sprang back with a cry. 'there are dead things, dead fac

es in the water,' he said with horror. 'dead faces! '
gollum laughed. 'the dead marshes, yes, yes: that is their names,' he cackled. `you should not look in when the candles are lit.'
`who are they? what are they? ' asked sam shuddering, turning to frodo, who was now behind him.
'i don't know,' said frodo in a dreamlike voice. 'but i have seen them too. in the pools when the candles were lit. they lie in all the pools, pale faces, deep deep under the dark water. i saw them: grim faces and evil, and noble faces and sad. many faces proud and fair, and weeds in their silver hair. but all foul, all rotting, all dead. a fell light is in them.' frodo hid his eyes in his hands. 'i know not who they are; but i thought i saw
 
 ___________________________
 
, yes,' said gollum. `all dead, all rotten. elves and men and orcs. the dead marshes. there was a great battle long ago, yes, so they told him when sméagol was young, when i was young before the precious came. it was a great battle. tall men with long swords, and terrible elves, and orcses shrieking. they fought on the plain for days and months at the black gates. but the marshes have grown since then, swallowed up the graves; always creeping, creeping.'
'but that is an age and more ago,' said sam. 'the dead can't be really there! is it some devilry hatched in the dark land? '
`who knows? sméagol doesn't know,' answered gollum. 'you cannot reach them, you cannot touch them. we tried once, .yes, precious. i tried once; but you cannot reach them. only shapes to see, perhaps, not to touch. no precious! all dead.'
sam looked darkly at him and shuddered again, thinking that he guessed why sméagol had tried to touch them. `well, i don't want to see them,' he said. 'never again! can't we get

on and get away? '
`yes, yes,' said gollum. `but slowly, very slowly. very carefully! or hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles. follow sméagol! don't look at lights! '
he crawled away to the right, seeking for a path round the mere. they came close behind, stooping, often using their hands even as he did. 'three precious little gollums in a row we shall be, if this goes on much longer,' thought sam.
at last they came to the end of the black mere, and they crossed it, perilously, crawling or hopping from one treacherous island tussock to another. often they floundered, stepping or falling hands-first into waters as noisome as a cesspool, till they were slimed and fouled almost up to their necks and stank in one another's nostrils.
it was late in the night when at length they reached firmer ground again. gollum hissed and whispered to himself, but it appeared that he was pleased: in some my

we go! ' he said. 'nice hobbits! brave hobbits! very very weary, of course; so we are, my precious, all of us. but we must take master away from the wicked lights, yes, yes, we must.' with these words he started off again, almost at a trot, down what appeared to be a long lane between high reeds, and they stumbled after him as quickly as they could. but in a little while he stopped suddenly and sniffed the air doubtfully, hissing as if he was troubled or displeased again.
'what is it? ' growled sam, misinterpreting the signs. `what's the need to sniff? the stink nearly knocks me down with my nose held. you stink, and master stinks; the whole place stinks.'
'yes, yes, and sam stinks! ' answered gollum. `poor sméagol smells it, but good sméagol bears it. helps nice master. but that's no matter. the air's moving, change is coming. sméagol wonders; he's not happy.'
he went on again, but his uneasiness grew, and every now and again he stood up to his full height, craning his neck eastward a

nd southward. for some time the hobbits could not hear or feel what was troubling him. then suddenly all three halted, stiffening and listening. to frodo and sam it seemed that they heard, far away, a long wailing cry, high and thin and cruel. they shivered. at the same moment the stirring of the air became perceptible to them; and it grew very cold. as they stood straining their ears, they heard a noise like a wind coming in the distance. the misty lights wavered, dimmed, and went out.
gollum would not move. he stood shaking and gibbering to himself, until with a rush the wind came upon them, hissing and snarling over the marshes. the night became less dark, light enough for them to see, or half see, shapeless drifts of fog, curling and twisting as it rolled

 over them and passed them. looking up they saw the clouds breaking and shredding; and then high in the south the moon glimmered out, riding in the flying wrack.
for a moment the sight of it gladdened the hearts of the hobbits; but gollum cowered down, muttering curses on the white face. then frodo and sam staring at the sky, breathing deeply of the fresher air, saw it come: a small cloud flying from the accursed hills; a black shadow loosed from mordor; a vast shape winged and ominous. it scudded across the moon, and with a deadly cry went away westward, outrunning the wind in its fell speed.
they fell forward, grovelling heedlessly on the cold earth. but the shadow of horror wheeled and returned, passing lower now, right above them, sweeping the fen-reek with its ghastly wings. and then it was

gone, flying back to mordor with the speed of the wrath of sauron; and behind it the wind roared away, leaving the dead marshes bare and bleak. the naked waste, as far as the eye could pierce, even to the distant menace of the mountains, was dappled with the fitful moonlight.
frodo and sam got up, rubbing their eyes, like children wakened from an evil dream to find the familiar night still over the world. but gollum lay on the ground as if he had been stunned. they roused him with difficulty, and for some time he would not lift his face, but knelt forward on his elbows, covering the back of his head with his large flat hands.
`wraiths!' he wailed. `wraiths on wings! the precious is their master. they see everything, everything. nothing can hide from them. curse the white face! an

d they tell him everything. he sees, he knows. ach, gollum, gollum, gollum! ' it was not until the moon had sunk, westering far beyond tol brandir, that he would get up or make a move.
from that time on sam thought that he sensed a change in gollum again. he was more fawning and would-be friendly; but sam surprised some strange looks in his eyes at times, especially towards frodo; and he went back more and more into his old manner of speaking. and sam had another growing anxiety. frodo seemed to be weary, weary to the point of exhaustion. he said nothing. indeed he hardly spoke at all; and he did not complain, but he walked like one who carries a load, the weight of which is ever increasing; and he dragged along, slower and slower, so that sam had often to beg gollum to wait and not to leave their master behind.
in fact with every step towards the gates of mordor frodo felt the ring on its chain about his neck grow more burdensome. he was no

ing sense of a hostile will that strove with great power to pierce all shadows of cloud, and earth, and flesh, and to see you: to pin you under its deadly gaze, naked, immovable. so thin, so frail and thin, the veils were become that still warded it off. frodo knew just where the present habitation and heart of that will now was: as certainly as a man can tell the direction of the sun with his eyes shut. he was facing it, and its potency beat upon his brow.
gollum probably felt something of the same sort. but what went on in his wretched heart between the pressure of the eye, and the lust of the ring that was so near, and his grovelling promise made half in the fear of cold iron, the hobbits did not guess: frodo gave no thought to it. sam's mind was occupied mostly with his master hardly noticing the dark cloud that had fallen on his own heart. he put frodo in front of him now, and kept a watchful eye on every movement of his, supporting him if he stumbled, and trying to encourage him wit

they had come to the desolation that lay before mordor: the lasting monument to the dark labour of its slaves that should endure when all their purposes were made void; a land defiled, diseased beyond all healing - unless the great sea should enter in and wash it with oblivion. `i feel sick,' said sam. frodo did not speak.
for a while they stood there, like men on the edge of a sleep where nightmare lurks, holding it off, though they know that they can only come to morning through the shadows. the light broadened and hardened. the gasping pits and poisonous mounds grew hideously clear. the sun was up, walking among clouds and long flags of smoke, but even the sunlight was defiled. the hobbits had no welcome for that light; unfriendly it seemed, revealing them in their helplessness - little s

too weary to go further they sought for some place where they could rest. for a while they sat without speaking under the shadow of a mound of slag; but foul fumes leaked out of it, catching their throats and choking them. gollum was the first to get up. spluttering and cursing he rose, and without a word or a glance at the hobbits he crawled away on all fours. frodo and sam crawled after him, until they came to a wide almost circular pit, high-banked upon the west. it was cold and dead, and a foul sump of oily many-coloured ooze lay at its bottom. in this evil hole they cowered, hoping in its shadow to escape the attention of the eye.
the day passed slowly. a great thirst troubled them, but they drank only a few drops from their bottles-last filled in the gully, which now as they looked back in thought seemed to them a place of peace and beauty. the hobbits took i

t in turn to watch. at first, tired as they were, neither of them could sleep at all; but as the sun far away was climbing down into slow moving cloud, sam dozed. it was frodo's turn to be on guard. he lay back on the slope of the pit, but that did not ease the sense of burden that was on him. he looked up at the smoke-streaked sky and saw strange phantoms, dark riding shapes, and faces out of the past. he lost count of time, hovering between sleep and waking, until forgetfulness came over him.
suddenly sam woke up thinking that he heard his master calling. it was evening. frodo could not have called, for he had fallen asleep, and had slid down ne

arly to the bottom of the pit. gollum was by him. for a moment sam thought that he was trying to rouse frodo; then he saw that it was not so. gollum was talking to himself. sméagol was holding a debate with some other thought that used the same voice but made it squeak and hiss. a pale light and a green light alternated in his eyes as he spoke.
`sméagol promised,' said the first thought.
`yes, yes, my precious,' came the answer, 'we promised: to save our precious, not to let him have it - never. but it's going to him yes, nearer every step. what's the hobbit going to do with it, we wonders, yes we wonders.'
`i don't know. i can't help it. master's got it. sméagol promised to help the master.'
`yes, yes, to help the master: the mast

ast effort. `not now. not yet.'
'we wants it! but' - and here there was a long pause, as if a new thought had wakened. `not yet, eh? perhaps not. she might help. she might, yes.'
`no, no! not that way! ' wailed sméagol.
`yes! we wants it! we wants it! '
each time that the second thought spoke, gollum's long hand crept out slowly, pawing towards frodo, and then was drawn back with a jerk as sméagol spoke again. finally both arms, with long fingers flexed and twitching, clawed towards his neck.
sam had lain still, fascinated by this debate, but watching every move that gollum made from under his half-closed eye-lids. to his simple mind ordinary hunger, the desire to eat hobbits, had seemed the chief danger in gollum. he realized now that it was not so: gollum was feeling the terrible call of the ring. the dark lord was he, of course; but sam wondered who she was. one of the nasty friends the little wretch had made in his wanderings, he supposed. then he forgot the point, for things had pl

enough, and were getting dangerous. a great heaviness was in all his limbs, but he roused himself with an effort and sat up. something warned him to be careful and not to reveal that he had overheard the debate. he let out a loud sigh and gave a huge yawn.
`what's the time? ' he said sleepily.
gollum sent out a long hiss through his teeth. he stood up for a moment, tense and menacing; and then he collapsed, falling forward on to all fours and crawling up the bank of the pit. 'nice hobbits! nice sam! ' he said. 'sleepy heads, yes, sleepy heads! leave good sméagol to watch! but it's evening. dusk is creeping. time to go.'
`high time! ' thought sam. 'and time we parted, too.' yet it crossed his mind to wonder if indeed gollum was not now as dangerous turned loose as kept with them. 'curse him! i wish he was choked!' he muttered. he stumbled down the bank and roused his master.
strangely enough, frodo felt refreshed. he had been dreaming. the dark shadow had passed, and a fair vision had vis

he said. `you have guided us well and faithfully. this is the last stage. bring us to the gate, and then i will not ask you to go further. bring us to the gate, and you may go where you wish - only not to our enemies.'
'to the gate, eh?' gollum squeaked, seeming surprised and frightened. 'to the gate, master says! yes, he says so. and good sméagol does what he asks, o yes. but when we gets closer, we'll see perhaps we'll see then. it won't look nice at all. o no! o no!'
'go on with you! ' said sam. `let's get it over! '
in the falling dusk they scrambled out of the pit and slowly threaded their way through the dead land. they had not gone far before they felt once more the fear that had fallen on them when the winged shape swept over the marshes. they halted, cowering on the evil-smelling ground; but they saw nothing in the gloomy evening sky above, and soon the menace passed, high overhead, going maybe on some swift errand from barad-dûr. after a while gollum got up and crept forward a

he watch-towers they blared, and far away from hidden holds and outposts in the hills came answering calls; and further still, remote but deep and ominous, there echoed in the hollow land beyond the mighty horns and drums of barad-dûr. another dreadful day of fear and toil had come to mordor; and the night-guards were summoned to their dungeons and deep halls, and the day-guards, evil-eyed and fell, were marching to their posts. steel gleamed dimly on the battlement.
`well, here we are! ' said sam. `here's the gate, and it looks to me as if that's about as far as we are ever going to get. my word, but the gaffer would have a thing or two to say, if he saw me now! often said i'd come to a bad end, if i didn't watch my step, he did. but now i don't suppose i'll ever see the old fellow again. he'll miss his chance of i told'ee so, sam: more's the pity. he could go on telling me as long as he'd got breath, if only i could see his old face again. but i'd have to get a wash first, or he wouldn

`i suppose it's no good asking "what way do we go now?" we can't go no further-unless we want to ask the orcs for a lift.'

'then what the plague did you bring us here for? ' said sam, not feeling in the mood to be just or reasonable.
`master said so. master says: bring us to the gate. so good sméagol does so. master said so, wise master.'
'i did,' said frodo. his face was grim and set. but resolute. he was filthy, haggard, and pinched with weariness, but he cowered no longer, and his eyes were clear. `i said so, because i purpose to enter mordor, and i know no other way. therefore i shall go this way. i do not ask anyone to go with me.'
`no, no, master! ' wailed gollum; pa

'i am commanded to go to the land of mordor, and therefore i shall go,' said frodo. 'if there is only one way, then i must take it. what comes after must come.'
sam said nothing. the look on frodo's face was enough for him he knew that words of his were useless. and after all he never had any real hope in the affair from the beginning; but being a cheerful hobbit he had not needed hope, as long as despair could be postponed. now they were come to the bitter end. but he had stuck to his master all the way; that was what he had chiefly come for, and he would still stick to him. his master would not go to mordor alone. sam would go with him-and at any rate th

sam frowned. if he could have bored holes in gollum with his eyes, he would have done. his mind was full of doubt. to all appearances gollum was genuinely distressed and anxious to help frodo. but sam, remembering the overheard debate, found it hard to believe that the long submerged sméagol had come out on top: that voice at any rate had not had the last word in the debate. sam's guess was that the sméagol and gollum halves (or what in his own mind he called slinker and stinker) had made a truce

 and a temporary alliance: neither wanted the enemy to get the ring; both wished to keep frodo from capture, and under their eye, as long as possible - at any rate as long as stinker still had a chance of laying hands on his 'precious'. whether there really was another way into mordor sam doubted.
`and it's a good thing neither half of the old villain don't know what master means to do,' he thought. `if he knew that mr. frodo is trying to put an end to his precious for good and all, there'd be trouble pretty quick, i bet. anyhow old stinker is so frightened of the enemy - and he's under orders of some kind from him, or was - that he'd give us away rather than be caught helping us; and rather than let his precious be melted, maybe. at least that's my idea. and i hope the master w

ill think it out carefully. he's as wise as any, but he's soft-hearted, that's what he is. it's beyond any gamgee to guess what he'll do next.'
frodo did not answer gollum at once. while these doubts were passing through sam's slow but shrewd mind, he stood gazing out towards the dark cliff of cirith gorgor. the hollow in which they had taken refuge was delved in the side of a low hill, at some little height above a long trenchlike valley that lay between it and the outer buttresses of the mountains. in the midst of the valley stood the black foundations of the western watch-tower. by morning-light the roads that converged upon the gate of mordor could now be clearly seen, pale and dusty; one winding back northward

ay, so near to this vast menace, frodo quickly drew his frail grey hood close upon his head, and stepped down into the dell. then he turned to gollum.
`sméagol,' he said, `i will trust you once more. lndeed it seems that i must do so, and that it is my fate to receive help from you. where i least looked for it, and your fate to help me whom you long pursued with evil purpose. so far you have deserved well of me and have kept your promise truly. truly, i say and mean,' he added with a glance at sam, 'for twice now we have been in your power, and you have done no harm to us. nor have you tried to take from me what you once sought. may the third time prove the best! but i warn you, sméagol, you are in danger.'
`yes, yes, master! ' said gollum. `dreadful danger! sméagol's bones shake to think of it. but he doesn't run away. he must help nice master.'
'i did not mean the danger that we all share,' said frodo. 'i mean a danger to yourself alone. you swore a promise by what you call the preci

oolishly. give it back to sméagol you said. do not say that again! do not let that thought grow in you! you will never get it back. but the desire of it may betray you to a bitter end. you will never get it back. in the last need, sméagol, i should put on the precious; and the precious mastered you long ago. if i, wearing it, were to command you, you would obey, even if it were to leap from a precipice or to cast yourself into the fire. and such would be my command. so have a care, sméagol!'
sam looked at his master with approval, but also with surprise: there was a look in his face and a tone in his voice that he had not known before. it had always been a notion of his that the kindness of dear mr. frodo was of such a high degree that it must imply a fair measure of blindness. of course, he also firmly held the incompatible belief that mr. frodo was the wisest person in the world (with the possible exception of old mr. bilbo and of gandalf). gollum in his own way, and with much more e

`but how will that help us? ' asked sam. `surely the enemy knows all about his own mountains, and that road will be guarded as close as this? the tower isn't empty, is it? '
`o no, not empty! ' whispered gollum. `it seems empty, but it isn't, o no! very dreadful things live there. orcs. yes always orcs; but worse things, worse things live there too. the road climbs right under the shadow of the walls and passes the gate. nothing moves on the road that they don't know about. the things inside know: the silent watchers.'

`no, no indeed,' said gollum. `hobbits must see, must try to understand. he does not expect attack that way. his eye is all round, but it attends more to some places than to others. he can't see everything all at once, not yet. you see, he has conquered all the country west of the shadowy mountains down to the river, and he holds the bridges now. he thinks no one can come to the moontower without fighting big battle at the bridges, or get

'you seem to know a lot about what he's doing and thinking,' said sam. `have you been talking to him lately? or just hobnobbing with orcs? '
'not nice hobbit, not sensible,' said gollum, giving sam an angry glance and turning to frodo. 'sméagol has talked to orcs, yes of course, before he met master, and to many peoples: he has walked very far. and what he says now many peoples are saying. it's here in the north that the big danger is for him, and for us. he will come out of the black gate one day, one day soon. that is the only way big armies can come. but away down west he is not afraid, and there are the silent watchers.'

'a little path leading up into the mountains: and then a stair, a narrow stair, o yes, very long and narrow. and then more stairs. and then' - his voice sank even lower - `a tunnel, a dark tunnel; and at last a little cleft, and a path high above the main pass. it was that way that sméagol got out of the darkness. but it was years ago. the path may have vanished now; but perhaps not, perhaps not.'
`i don't like the sound of it at all,' said sam. `sounds too easy at any rate in the telling. if that path is still there, it'll be guarded too. wasn't it guarded, gollum? ' as he said this, he caught or fancied he caught a green gleam in gollum's eye. gollum muttered but did not reply.
'is it not guarded? ' asked frodo sternly. `and did you escape out of the darkness, sméagol? were you not rather permitted to depart upon an errand? that at least is w hat aragorn thought, who found you by the dead marshes some years ago.'

its name was cirith ungol, a name of dreadful rumour. aragorn could perhaps have told them that name and its significance: gandalf would have warned them. but they were alone, and aragorn was far away, and gandalf stood amid the ruin of isengard and strove with saruman, delayed by treason. yet even as he spoke his last words to saruman, and the palantír crashed in fire upon the steps of orthanc. his thought was ever upon frodo and samwise, over the long leagues his mind sought for them in hope and pity.
maybe frodo felt it, not knowing it, as he had upon amon hen, even though he believed that gandalf was gone, gone for ever into the shadow in moria far away. he sat upon the ground for a long while, silent, his head bowed, striving to recall all that gandalf had said to him. but for this choice he could recall no counsel. indeed gandalf's guidance had been taken from them too soon, too soon, while the dark land was still very

not even an eagle poised against the sun would have marked the hobbits sitting there, under the weight of doom, silent, µ not moving, shrouded in their thin grey cloaks. for a moment he might have paused to consider gollum, a tiny figure sprawling on the ground: there perhaps lay the famished skeleton of some child of men, its ragged garment still clinging to it, its long arms and legs almost bone-white and bone-thin: no flesh worth a peck.
frodo's head was bowed over his knees, but sam leaned back, with hands behind his head, staring out of his hood at the empty sky. at least for a long while it was empty. then presently sam thought he saw a dark bird-like figure wheel into the circle of his sight, and hover, and then wheel away again. two more followed, and then a fourth. they were very small to look at, yet he knew, somehow, that they were huge, with a vast stretch of pinion, flying at a great height. he covered his eyes and bent forward, cowering. the same warning fear was

 on him as he had felt in the presence of the black riders, the helpless horror that had come with the cry in the wind and the shadow on the moon, though now it was not so crushing or compelling: the menace was more remote. but menace it was. frodo felt it too. his thought was broken. he stirred and shivered, but he did not look up. gollum huddled himself together like a cornered spider. the winged shapes wheeled, and stooped swiftly down, speeding back to mordor.
sam took a deep breath. `the riders are about again, up in the air,' he said in a hoarse whisper. 'i saw them. do you think they could see us? they were very high up. and if they are black riders same as before, then they can't see much by daylight, can they? '
'no, perhaps not,' said frodo. `but their steeds could see. and these winged creatures that they ride on now, they can probably see more than any other creature. they are like great carrion birds. they are looking for something: the enemy is

 he was about to speak and to decide. but `hark!' he said. `what is that?'
a new fear was upon them. they heard singing and hoarse shouting. at first it seemed a long way off, but it drew nearer: it was coming towards them. it leaped into all their minds that the black wings had spied them and had sent armed soldiers to seize them: no speed seemed too great for these terrible servants of sauron. they crouched, listening. the voices and the clink of weapons and harness were very close. frodo and sam loosened their small swords in their sheaths. flight was impossible.
gollum rose slowly and crawled insect-like to the lip of the hollow. very cautiously he raised himself inch by inch, until he could peer over it between two broken points of stone. he remained there without moving for some time, making no sound. presently the voices began to recede again, and then they slowly faded away. far off a horn blew on the ramparts of the morannon. then quietly gollum drew back and slipped down into th

`were there any oliphaunts?' asked sam, forgetting his fear in his eagerness for news of strange places.
`no, no oliphaunts. what are oliphaunts? ' said gollum.
sam stood up, putting his hands behind his back (as he always did when 'speaking poetry'), and began:

big as a house.
nose like a snake,
i make the earth shake,
as i tramp through the grass;
trees crack as i pass.
with horns in my mouth

and i never lie.
'that,' said sam, when he had finished reciting, `that's a rhyme we have in the shire. nonsense maybe, and maybe not. but we have our tales too, and news out of the south, you know. in the old days hobbits used to go on their travels now and again. not that many ever came back, and not that all they said was believed: news from bree, and not sure as shiretalk, as the sayings go. but i've heard tales of the big folk down away in the sunlands. swertings we call 'em in our tales; and they ride on oliphaunts, 'tis

`no, no oliphaunts,' said gollum again. 'sméagol has not heard of them. he does not want to see them. he does not want them to be. sméagol wants to go away from here and hide somewhere safer. sméagol wants master to go. nice master, won't he come with sméagol? '
frodo stood up. he had laughed in the midst of all his cares when sam trotted out the old fireside rhyme of oliphaunt, and the laugh had released him from hesitation. `i wish we had a thousand oliphaunts with gandalf on a white one at their head,' he said. `then we'd break a way into this evil land, perhaps. but we've not; just our own tired legs, that's all. well, sméagol, the third turn may turn the best. i will come with you.'

ack gate that was still all too near, hidden though it was behind the gloomy heights. they looked about for a hiding-place where they could shelter from evil eyes while the light lasted.
the day passed uneasily. they lay deep in the heather and counted out the slow hours, in which there seemed little change; for they were still under the shadows of the ephel dúath, and the sun was veiled. frodo slept at times, deeply and peacefully, either trusting gollum or too tired to trouble about him; but sam found it difficult to do more than doze, even when gollum was plainly fast asleep, whiffling and twitching in his secret dreams. hunger, perhaps, more than mistrust kept him wakeful: he had begun to long for a good homely meal, `something hot out of the pot'.
as soon as the land faded into a formless grey under coming night, they started out again. in a little while gollum led them down on to the southward road; and after that they went on more quickly, though the danger was greater. their ears

and retched; but the hobbits breathed deep, and suddenly sam laughed, for heart's ease not for jest. they followed a stream that went quickly down before them. presently it brought them to a small clear lake in a shallow dell: it lay in the broken ruins of an ancient stone basin, the carven rim of which was almost wholly covered with mosses and rose-brambles; iris-swords stood in ranks about it. and water-lily leaves floated on its dark gently-rippling surface; but it was deep and fresh, and spilled ever softly out over a stony lip at the far end.

ing freshet. then they sought for a resting-place, and a hiding-place: for this land, fair-seeming still, was nonetheless now territory of the enemy. they had not come very far from the road, and yet even in so short a space they had seen scars of the old wars, and the newer wounds made by the orcs and other foul servants of the dark lord: a pit of uncovered filth and refuse; trees hewn down wantonly and left to die, with evil runes or the fell sign of the eye cut in rude strokes on their bark.
sam scrambling below the outfall of the lake. smelling and touching the unfamiliar plants and trees, forgetful for the moment of mordor, was reminded suddenly of their ever-present peril. he stumbled on a ring still scorched by fire, and in the midst of it he found a pile of charred and broken bones and skulls. the swift growth of the wild with briar and eglantine and trailing clematis was already drawing a veil over this place of dreadful feast and slaughter; but it was not ancient. he hurried bac

sam had been giving earnest thought to food as they marched. now that the despair of the impassable gate was behind him, he did not feel so inclined as his master to take no thought for their livelihood beyond the end of their errand; and anyway it seemed wiser to him to save the waybread of the elves for worse times ahead. six days or more had passed since he reckoned that they had only a bare supply for three weeks.
'if we reach the fire in that time, we'll be lucky at this rate! ' he thought. `a

besides, at the end of a long night-march, and after bathing and drinking, he felt even more hungry than usual. a supper, or a breakfast, by the fire in the old kitchen at bagshot row was what he really wanted. an idea struck him and he turned to gollum. gollum had just begun to sneak off on his own, and he was crawling away on all fours through the fern.
`hi! gollum! ' said sam. `where are you going? hunting? well see here, old noser, you don't like our food, and i'd not be sorry for a change myself. your new motto's always ready to help. could you find anything fit for a hungry hobbit? '
`yes, perhaps, yes,' said gollum. `sméagol always helps, if they asks - if they asks nicely.'
`right!' said sam `i does ask. and if that isn't nice enough, i begs.'
gollum disappeared. he was away some time, and frodo after a few mouthfuls of lembas settled deep into the brown fern

and went to sleep. sam looked at him. the early daylight was only just creeping down into the shadows under the trees, but he saw his master's face very clearly, and his hands, too, lying at rest on the ground beside him. he was reminded suddenly of frodo as he had lain, asleep in the house of elrond, after his deadly wound. then as he had kept watch sam had noticed that at times a light seemed to be shining faintly within; but now the light was even clearer and stronger. frodo's face was peaceful, the marks of fear and care had left it; but it looked old, old and beautiful, as if the chiselling of the shaping years was now revealed in many fine lines that had before been hidden, though the identity of the face was not changed. not that sam gamgee put it that way to himself. he shook his head, as if finding words useless, and murmured: `i love

him. he's like that, and sometimes it shines through, somehow. but i love him, whether or no.'
gollum returned quietly and peered over sam's shoulder. looking at frodo, he shut his eyes and crawled away without a sound. sam came to him a moment later and found him chewing something and muttering to himself. on the ground beside him lay two small rabbits, which he was beginning to eye greedily.
'sméagol always helps,' he said. `he has brought rabbits, nice rabbits. but master has gone to sleep, and perhaps sam wants to sleep. doesn't want rabbits now? sméagol tries to help, but he can't catch things all in a minute.'
sam, however, had no objection to rabbit at all, and said so. at least not to cooked rabbit. all

hobbits, of course, can cook, for they begin to learn the art before their letters (which many never reach): but sam was a good cook, even by hobbit reckoning, and he had done a good deal of the camp-cooking on their travels, when there was a chance. he still hopefully carried some of his gear in his pack: a small tinder-box, two small shallow pans, the smaller fitting into the larger; inside them a wooden spoon, a short two-pronged fork and some skewers were stowed; and hidden at the bottom of the pack in a flat wooden box a dwindling treasure, some salt. but he needed a fire, and other things besides. he th

ought for a bit, while he took out his knife, cleaned and whetted it, and began to dress the rabbits. he was not going to leave frodo alone asleep even for a few minutes.
'now, gollum,' he said, 'i've another job for you. go and fill these pans with water, and bring 'em back! '
'sméagol will fetch water, yes,' said gollum. 'but what does the hobbit want all that water for? he has drunk, he has washed.'
'never you mind,' said sam. `if you can't guess, you'll soon find out. and the sooner you fetch the water, the sooner you'll learn. don't you damage one of my pans, or i'll carve you into mincemeat.'
while gollum was away sam took another look at frodo. he was still sleeping quietly, but sam was now struck most by the leanness of his face and hands. 'too thin and drawn he is,' he muttered. 'not right for a hobbit. if i can get these coneys cooked, i'm going to wake him up.'
sam gathered a pile of the driest fern, and the

r at the top gave him a good supply. he cut out some turves at the foot of the bank just outside the fern-brake, and made a shallow hole and laid his fuel in it. being handy with flint and tinder he soon had a small blaze going. it made little or no smoke but gave off an aromatic scent. he was just stooping over his fire, shielding it and building it up with heavier wood, when gollum returned, carrying the pans carefully and grumbling to himself.
he set the pans down, and then suddenly saw what sam was doing. he gave a thin hissing shriek, and seemed to be both frightened and angry. `ach! sss - no!' he cried. `no! silly hobbits, foolish, yes foolish! they mustn't do it!'
`mustn't do what?' asked sam in surprise.
`not make the nassty red tongues,' hissed gollum. `fire, fire! it's dangerous, yes it is. it burns, it kills. and it will bring enemies, yes it will.'
'i don't think so,' said sam. `don't see why it should, if you don't put wet stuff on it and make a smother. but if it does, it do

es. i'm going to risk it, anyhow. i'm going to stew these coneys.'
'stew the rabbits!' squealed gollum in dismay. `spoil beautiful meat sméagol saved for you, poor hungry sméagol! what for? what for, silly hobbit? they are young, they are tender, they are nice. eat them, eat them!' he clawed at the nearest rabbit, already skinned and lying by the fire.
`now, now! ' said sam. `each to his own fashion. our bread chokes you, and raw coney chokes me. if you give me a coney, the coney's mine, see, to cook, if i have a mind. and i have. you needn't watch me. go and catch another and eat it as you fancy - somewhere private and out o' my sight. then you won't see the fire, and i shan't see you, and we'll both be the happier. i'll see the fire don't smoke, if that's any comfort to you.'
gollum withdrew grumbling, and crawled into the fern. sam busied himself with his pans.

 `what a hobbit needs with coney,' he said to himself, `is some herbs and roots, especially taters - not to mention bread. herbs we can manage, seemingly.'
`gollum!' he called softly. `third time pays for all. i want some herbs.' gollum's head peeped out of the fern, but his looks were neither helpful nor friendly. `a few bay-leaves, some thyme and sage, will do - before the water boils,' said sam.
`no! ' said gollum. `sméagol is not pleased. and sméagol doesn't like smelly leaves. he doesn't eat grasses or roots, no precious, not till he's starving or very sick, poor sméagol. '
`sméagol'll get into real true hot water, when this water boils, if he don't do as he's asked,' growled sam. `sam'll put his head in it, yes precious. and i'd make him look for turnips and carrots, and taters too, if it was the time o' the year. i'll bet there's all sorts of good things running wild in this c

ountry. i'd give a lot for half a dozen taters.'
`sméagol won't go, o no precious, not this time,' hissed gollum. `he's frightened, and he's very tired, and this hobbit's not nice, not nice at all. sméagol won't grub for roots and carrotses and - taters. what's taters, precious, eh, what's taters?
`po-ta-toes,' said sam. 'the gaffer's delight, and rare good ballast for an empty belly. but you won't find any, so you needn't look. but be good sméagol and fetch me the herbs, and i'll think better of you. what's more, if you turn over a new leaf, and keep it turned, i'll cook you some taters one of these days. i will: fried fish and chips served by s. gamgee. you couldn't say no to that.'
`yes, yes we could. spoiling nice fish, scorching it. give me fish now, and keep nassty chips! '
`oh you're hopeless,' said sa

m. 'go to sleep!'
in the end he had to find what he wanted for himself; but he did not have to go far, not out of sight of the place where his master lay, still sleeping. for a while sam sat musing, and tending the fire till the water boiled. the daylight grew and the air became warm; the dew faded off turf and leaf. soon the rabbits cut up lay simmering in their pans with the bunched herbs. almost sam fell asleep as the time went by. he let them stew for close on an hour, testing them now and again with his fork, and tasting the broth.
when he thought all was ready he lifted the pans off the fire, and crept along to frodo. frodo half opened his eyes as sam stood over him, and then he wakened from his dreaming: another gentle, unrecoverable dream of peace.
`hullo, sam! ' he said. `not resting? is anything wrong? what is the time? '
`about a couple of hours after daybreak,' said sam, `and nigh

 on half past eight by shire clocks, maybe. but nothing's wrong. though it ain't quite what i'd call right: no stock, no onions, no taters. i've got a bit of a stew for you, and some broth, mr. frodo. do you good. you'll have to sup it in your mug; or straight from the pan, when it's cooled a bit. i haven't brought no bowls, nor nothing proper.'
frodo yawned and stretched. 'you should have been resting sam,' he said. 'and lighting a fire was dangerous in these parts. but i do feel hungry. hmm! can i smell it from here? what have you stewed? '
'a present from sméagol,' said sam: `a brace o' young coneys; though i fancy gollum's regretting them now. but there's nought to go with them but a few herbs.'
sam and his master sat just within the fern-brake and ate their stew from the pans, sharing the old fork and spoon. they allowed themselves half a piece of the elvish waybread each. it seemed a feast

.
'wheew! gollum! ' sam called and whistled softly. 'come on! still time to change your mind. there's some left, if you want to try stewed coney.' there was no answer.
`oh well, i suppose he's gone off to find something for himself. we'll finish it,' said sam.
`and then you must take some sleep,' said frodo.
`don't you drop off, while i'm nodding, mr. frodo. i don't feel too sure of him. there's a good deal of stinker-the bad gollum, if you understand me-in him still, and it's getting stronger again. not but what i think he'd try to throttle me first now. we don't see eye to eye, and he's not pleased with sam, o no precious, not pleased at all.'
they finished, and sam went off to the stream to rinse his gear. as he stood up to return, he looked back

smoke, plain to see as it caught the sunlight, rising from a thicket above him. with a shock he realized that this was the smoke from his little cooking-fire, which he had neglected to put out.
`that won't do! never thought it would show like that! ' he muttered, and he started to hurry back. suddenly he halted and listened. had he heard a whistle or not? or was it the call of some strange bird? if it was a whistle, it did not come from frodo's direction. there it went again from another place! sam began to run as well as he could uphill.
he found that a small brand, burning away to its outer end, had kindled some fern at the edge of the fire, and the fern blazing up had set the turves smouldering. hastily he stamped out what was left of the fire, scattered the ashes, and laid the turves on the hole. then he crept back to frodo.
'did you hear a whistle, and what sounded like an answer? ' he asked. `a few minutes back. i hope it was only a bird, but it didn't sound quite like that: more li

hey were speaking low and furtively, but they were near, and coming nearer. then quite suddenly one spoke clearly close at hand.
`here! here is where the smoke came from! ' it said. `'twill be nigh at hand. in the fern, no doubt. we shall have it like a coney in a trap. then we shall learn what kind of thing it is.'
`aye, and what it knows! ' said a second voice.
at once four men came striding through the fern from different directions. since flight and hiding were no longer possible, frodo and sam sprang to their feet, putting back to back and whipping out their small swords.
if they were astonished at what they saw, their captors were even more astonished. four tall men stood there. two had spears in their hands with broad bright heads. two had great bows, almost of their own height, and great quivers of long green-feathered arrows. all had swords at their sides, and were clad in green and brown of varied hues, as if the better to walk unseen in the glades of ithilien. green gauntlets c

d in their manner of speech.
`we have not found what we sought,' said one. `but what have we found? '
'not orcs,' said another, releasing the hilt of his sword, which he had seized when he saw the glitter of sting in frodo's hand.
`elves? ' said a third, doubtfully.
`nay! not elves,' said the fourth, the tallest, and as it appeared the chief among them. `elves do not walk in ithilien in these days. and elves are wondrous fair to look upon, or so 'tis said.'
'meaning we're not, i take you,' said sam. `thank you kindly. and when you've finished discussing us, perhaps you'll say who you are, and why you can't let two tired travellers rest.'
the tall green man laughed grimly. `i am faramir, captain of gondor,' he said. `but there are no travellers in this land: only the servants of the dark tower, or of the white.'
`but we are neither,' said frodo. `and travellers we are, whatever captain faramir may say.'
'then make haste to declare yourselves and your errand,' said faramir. 'we have a work

ying breed of orc, i guess, or a creature of theirs. but he gave us the slip by some fox-trick.'
'i do not know where he is,' said frodo. 'he is only a chance companion met upon our road; and i am not answerable for him. if you come on him, spare him. bring him or send him to us. he is only a wretched gangrel creature, but i have him under my care for a while. but as for us, we are hobbits of the shire, far to the north and west, beyond many rivers. frodo son of drogo is my name, and with me is samwise son of hamfast, a worthy hobbit in my service. we have come by long ways - out of rivendell, or imladris as some call it.' here faramir started and grew intent. 'seven companions we had: one we lost at moria, the others we left at parth galen above rauros: two of my kin; a dwarf there was also, and an elf, and two men. they were aragorn; and boromir, who said that he came out of minas tirith, a city in the south.'
'boromir! ' all the four men exclaimed.

 come to teach them another lesson. great strength of them was reported to us some days ago, marching north. one of their regiments is due by our reckoning to pass by, some time ere noon-up on the road above, where it passes through the cloven way. the road may pass, but they shall not! not while faramir is captain. he leads now in all perilous ventures. but his life is charmed, or fate spares him for some other end.'
their talk died down into a listening silence. all seemed still and watchful. sam, crouched by the edge of the fern-brake, peered out. with his keen hobbit-eyes he saw that many more men were about. he could see them stealing up the slopes, singly or in long files, keeping always to the shade of grove or thicket, or crawling, hardly visible in their brown and green raiment, through grass and brake. all were hooded and masked, and had gauntlets on their hands, and were armed like faramir and his companions. before long they had all passed and vanished. the sun rose till it ne

`i wonder where that dratted gollum is? ' thought sam, as he crawled back into deeper shade. `he stands a fair chance of being spitted for an orc, or of being roasted by the yellow face. but i fancy he'll look after himself.' he lay down beside frodo and began to doze.
he woke, thinking that he had heard horns blowing. he sat up. it was now high noon. the guards stood alert and tense in the shadow of the trees. suddenly the horns rang out louder and beyond mistake from above, over the top of the slope. sam thought that he heard cries and wild shou

ting also, but the sound was faint, as if it came out of some distant cave. then presently the noise of fighting broke out near at hand, just above their hiding-place. he could hear plainly the ringing grate of steel on steel, the clang of sword on iron cap, the dull beat of blade on shield; men were yelling and screaming, and one clear loud voice was calling gondor! gondor!
`it sounds like a hundred blacksmiths all smithying together,' said sam to frodo. 'they're as near as i want them now.'
but the noise grew closer. `they are coming!' cried damrod. `see! some of the southrons have broken from the trap and are flying from the road. there they go! our men after them, and the captain leading.'
sam, eager to see more, went now and joined the guards. he scrambled a little way up into one of the larger of the bay-trees. for a moment he caught a glimpse of swarthy men in red running down the slope some way off with green-clad warriors leap

 in the air. then suddenly straight over the rim of their sheltering bank, a man fell, crashing through the slender trees, nearly on top of them. he came to rest in the fern a few feet away, face downward, green arrow-feathers sticking from his neck below a golden collar. his scarlet robes were tattered, his corslet of overlapping brazen plates was rent and hewn, his black plaits of hair braided with gold were drenched with blood. his brown hand still clutched the hilt of a broken sword.
it was sam's first view of a battle of men against men, and he did not like it much. he was glad that he could not see the dead face. he wondered what the man's name was and where he came from; and if he was really evil of heart, or what lies or threats had led him on the long march from his home; and if he would not really rather have stayed there in peace-all in a flash of thought which was quickly driven from his mind. for just as mablung stepped towards the fallen body, there was a new noise. great cr

'ware! ware!' cried damrod to his companion. 'may the valar turn him aside! mûmak! mûmak!'
to his astonishment and terror, and lasting delight, sam saw a vast shape crash out of the trees and come careering down the slope. big as a house, much bigger than a house, it looked to him, a grey-clad moving hill. fear and wonder, maybe, enlarged him in the hobbit's eyes, but the mûmak of harad was indeed a beast of vast bulk, and the like of him does not walk now in middle-earth; his kin that live still in latter days are but memories of his girth and majesty. on he came, straight towards the watchers, and then swerved aside in the nick of time,

on the great beast thundered, blundering in blind wrath through pool and thicket. arrows skipped and snapped harmlessly about the triple hide of his flanks. men of both sides fled before him, but many he overtook and crushed to the ground. soon he was lost to view, still trumpeting and stamping far away. what became of him sam never heard: whether he escaped to roam the wild for a time, until he perished far from his home or was trapped in some deep pit; or whether he raged on until he plunged in the great river and was swallowed up.
sam drew a deep breath. 'an oliphaunt it was!' he said. `so there are oliphaunts, and i have seen one. what a life! but no one at home will ever believe me. well, if that's over, i'll have a bit of sleep.'
'sleep while you may,' said mablung. `but the captain will return, if he is unhurt

; and when he comes we shall depart swiftly. we shall be pursued as soon as news of our deed reaches the enemy, and that will not be long.'
`go quietly when you must!' said sam. `no need to disturb my sleep. i was walking all night.'
mablung laughed. `i do not think the captain will leave you here, master samwise,' he said. 'but you shall see.'

chapter 5

it seemed to sam that he had only dozed for a few minutes when he awoke to find that it was late afternoon and faramir had come back. he had brought many men with him; indeed all the survivors of the foray were now gathered on the slope nearby, two or three hundred strong. they sat in a wide semicircle, between the arms of which faramir was seated on the ground, while frodo stood before him. it looked strangely like the trial of a prisoner.
sam crept out from the fern, but no one paid any attention to him, and

he placed himself at the end of the rows of men, where he could see and hear all that was going on. he watched and listened intently, ready to dash to his master's aid if needed. he could see faramir's face, which was now unmasked: it was stern and commanding, and a keen wit lay behind his searching glance. doubt was in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at frodo.
sam soon became aware that the captain was not satisfied with frodo's account of himself at several points: what part he had to play in the company that set out from rivendell; why he had left boromir; and where he was now going. in particular he returned often to isildur's bane. plainly he saw that frodo was concealing from him some matter of great importance.
'but it was at the coming of the halfling that isildur's bane should waken, or so one must read the words,' he insisted. `if then you are t

as already at rauros many days back, and intended then to go straight to your city, if you return, you may soon learn the answers there. my part in the company was known to him, as to all the others. for it was appointed to me by elrond of imladris himself before the whole council. on that errand i came into this country, but it is not mine to reveal to any outside the company. yet those who claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder it.'
frodo's tone was proud, whatever he felt, and sam approved of it; but it did not appease faramir.
`so!' he said. `you bid me mind my own affairs, and get me back home, and let you be. boromir will tell all, when he comes. when he comes, say you! were you a friend of boromir?'
vividly before frodo's mind came the memory of boromir's assault upon him, and for a moment he hesitated. faramir's eyes watching him grew harder. 'boromir was a valiant member of our company ' said frodo at length. 'yes, i was his friend, for my part.'
faramir smiled gri

a falsehood?'
`i would not snare even an orc with a falsehood,' said faramir.
`how then did he die, and how do you know of it? since you say that none of the company had reached the city when you left.'
'as to the manner of his death, i had hoped that his friend and companion would tell me how it was.'
`but he was alive and strong when we parted. and he lives still for all that i know. though surely there are many perils in the world.'
`many indeed,' said faramir, `and treachery not the least.'
sam had been getting more and more impatient and angry at this conversation. these last words were more than he could bear, and bursting into the middle of the ring, he strode up to his master's side.
'begging your pardon, mr. frodo,' he said, `but this has gone on long enough. he's no right to talk to you so. after all you've gone through, as much for his good and all these great men as for anyone else.
'see here, captain! ' he planted himself squarely in front of faramir his hands on his hips, an

'
sam sat down heavily with a red face. faramir turned to frodo again: 'you asked how do i know that the son of denethor is dead. tidings of death have many wings. night oft brings news to near kindred, 'tis said. boromir was my brother.'
a shadow of sorrow passed over his face. `do you remember aught of special mark that the lord boromir bore with him among his gear?'
frodo thought for a moment, fearing some further trap, and wondering how this debate would turn in the end. he had hardly saved the r

cried. where is thy horn? whither goest thou? o boromir! but he was gone. the boat turned into the stream and passed glimmering on into the night. dreamlike it was. and yet no dream, for there was no waking. and i do not doubt that he is dead and has passed down the river to the sea.'
'alas!' said frodo. 'that was indeed boromir as i knew him. for the golden belt was given to him in lothlórien by the lady galadriel. she it was that clothed us as you see us, in elven-grey. this brooch is of the same workmanship.' he touched the green and silver leaf that fastened his cloak beneath his throat.
faramir looked closely at it. `it is beautiful,' he said. 'yes, 'tis work of the same craft. so then you passed through the land of lórien? laurelindórenan it was named of old, but long now it has lain beyond the knowledge of men,' he added softly, regarding frodo with a new wonder in his eyes. `much that was strange about you i begin now to understand. will you not tell me more? for it is a bitter

ck to minas tirith to answer there to denethor, and my life will justly be forfeit, if i now choose a course that proves ill for my city. so i will not decide in haste what is to be done. yet we must move hence without more delay.'
he sprang to his feet and issued some orders. at once the men who were gathered round him broke up into small groups, and went off this way and that, vanishing quickly into the shadows of the rocks and trees. soon only mablung and damrod remained.
'now you, frodo and samwise, will come with me and my guards,' said faramir. `you cannot go along the road southwards, if that was your purpose. it will be unsafe for some days, and always more closely watched after this affray than it has been yet. and you cannot, i think, go far today in any case, for you are weary. and so are we. we are going now to a secret place we have, somewhat less than ten miles from here. the orcs and spies of the enemy have not found it yet, and if they did, we could hold it long even again

st many. there we may lie up and rest for a while, and you with us. in the morning i will decide what is best for me to do, and for you.'
there was nothing for frodo to do but to fall in with this request, or order. it seemed in any case a wise course for the moment, since this foray of the men of gondor had made a journey in ithilien more dangerous than ever.
they set out at once: mablung and damrod a little ahead, and faramir with frodo and sam behind. skirting the hither side of the pool where the hobbits had bathed, they crossed the stream, climbed a long bank, and passed into green-shadowed woodlands that marched ever downwards and westwards. while they walked, as swiftly as the hobbits could go, they talked in hushed voices.
'i broke off our speech together,' said faramir, 'not only because time pressed, as master samwise had reminded me, but also because we were drawing near to matters that were better not debated openly before m

`i told no lies, and of the truth all i could,' said frodo.
`i do not blame you,' said faramir. 'you spoke with skill in a hard place, and wisely, it seemed to me. but i learned or guessed more from you than your words said. you were not friendly with boromir, or you did not part in friendship. you, and master samwise, too, i guess have some grievance. now i loved him dearly, and would gladly avenge his death, yet i knew him well. isildur's bane - i would hazard that isildur's bane lay between you and was a cause of contention in your company. clearly it is a mighty heirloom of some sort, and such things do not breed peace among confederates, not if aught may be learned from ancient tales. do i not hit near the mark?'
`near,' said frodo, 'but not in the gold. there was no contention in our company, thoug

aramir's voice sank to a whisper. 'but this much i learned or guessed, and i have kept it ever secret in my heart since: that isildur took somewhat from the hand of the unnamed, ere he went away from gondor, never to be seen among mortal men again. here i thought was the answer to mithrandir's questioning. but it seemed then a matter that concerned only the seekers after ancient learning. nor when the riddling words of our dream were debated among us, did i think of isildur's bane as being this same thing. for isildur was ambushed and slain by orc-arrows, according to the only legend that we knew, and mithrandir had never told me more.
`what in truth this thing is i cannot yet guess; but some heirloom of power and peril it must be. a fell weapon, perchance, devised by the dark lord. if it were a thing that gave advantage in battle. i can well believe that boromir, the proud and fearless, often rash, ever anxious for the victory of minas tirith (and his own glory therein), might desire suc

'so fear me not! i do not ask you to tell me more. i do not even ask you to tell me whether i now speak nearer the mark. but if you will trust me, it may be that i can advise you in your present quest, whatever that be-yes, and even aid you.'
frodo made no answer. almost he yielded to the desire for help and counsel, to tell this grave young man, whose words seemed so wise and fair, all that was in his mind. but something held him back. his heart was heavy with fear and sorrow: if he and sam were indeed, as seemed likely, all that was now left of the nine walkers, then he was in sole command of the secret of their errand. better mistrust undeserved than rash words. and the memory of boromir, of the dreadful change that the lure of the ring had worked in him, was very present to his mind, when he looked at faramir and listened to his voice: unlike they were, and yet also much akin.
they walked on in silence for a while, passing like grey and green shadows under the old trees, their

feet making no sound; above them many birds sang, and the sun glistened on the polished roof of dark leaves in the evergreen woods of ithilien.
sam had taken no part in the conversation, though he had listened; and at the same time he had attended with his keen hobbit ears to all the soft woodland noises about them. one thing he had noted, that in all the talk the name of gollum had not once come up. he was glad, though he felt that it was too much to hope that he would never hear it again. he soon became aware also that though they walked alone, there were many men close at hand: not only damrod and mablung flitting in and out of the shadows ahead, but others on either side, all making their swift secret way to som

so they passed on, until the woodlands grew thinner and the land began to fall more steeply. then they turned aside again, to the right, and came quickly to a small river in a narrow gorge: it was the same stream that trickled far above out of the round pool, now grown to a swift torrent, leaping down over many stones in a deep-cloven bed, overhung with ilex and dark box-woods. looking west they could see, below them in a haze of light, lowlands and broad meads, and glinting far off in the westering sun the wide waters of the anduin.
'here, alas! i must do you a discourtesy,' said faramir. "i hope you will pardon it to one who has so far made his orders give way to courtesy as not to slay you or

with green scarves the two guards now bound up the hobbits' eyes and drew their hoods down almost to their mouths; then quickly they took each one by the hand and went on their way. all that frodo and sam knew of this last mile of the road they learned from guessing in the dark. after a little they found that they were on a path descending steeply; soon it grew so narrow that they went in single file, brushing a stony wall on either side; their guards steered them from behind with hands laid firmly on their shoulders. now and again they came to rough places and were lifted from their feet for a while, and then set down again. always the noise of the running water was on their right hand, and it

atest. all the southrons had been accounted for, save only the great mûmak: what happened to him none could say. of the enemy no movement could be seen; not even an orc-spy was abroad.
'you saw and heard nothing, anborn?' faramir asked of the latest comer.
`well, no, lord,' said the man. `no orc at least. but i saw, or thought i saw, something a little strange. it was getting deep dusk, when the eyes make things greater than they should be. so perhaps it may have been no more than a squirrel.' sam pricked up his ears at this. 'yet if so, it was a black squirrel, and i saw no tail. 'twas like a shadow on the ground, and it whisked behind a tree-trunk when i drew nigh and went up aloft as swift as any squirrel could. you will not have us slay wild beasts for no purpose, and it seemed no more, so i tried no arrow. it was too dark for sure shooting anyway, and the creature was gone into the gloom of the leaves in a twinkling. but i stayed for a while, for it seemed strange, and then i hasten

`perhaps,' said faramir. `but that would be an ill omen, if it were so. we do not want the escapes of mirkwood in ithilien.' sam fancied that he gave a swift glance towards the hobbits as he spoke; but sam said nothing. for a while he and frodo lay back and watched the torchlight, and the men moving to and fro speaking in hushed voices. then suddenly frodo fell asleep.
sam struggled with himself, arguing this way and that. `he may be all right,' he thought, 'and then he may not. fair speech may hide a foul heart.' he yawned. `i could sleep for a week, and i'd be better for it. and what can i do, if i do keep awake, me all alone, and all these great men about? nothing, sam gamgee; but you've got t

o keep awake all the same.' and somehow he managed it. the light faded from the cave door, and the grey veil of falling water grew dim and was lost in gathering shadow. always the sound of the water went on, never changing its note, morning or evening or night. it murmured and whispered of sleep. sam stuck his knuckles in his eyes.
now more torches were being lit. a cask of wine was broached. storage barrels were being opened. men were fetching water from the fall. some were laving their hands in basins. a wide copper bowl and a white cloth were brought to faramir and he washed.
`wake our guests,' he said, `and take them water. it is time to eat.'
frodo sat up and yawned and stretched. sam, not used to being waited on, looked with some surprise at the tall man who bowed, holding a basin of

water before him.
'put it on the ground, master, if you please! ' he said. 'easier for me and you.' then to the astonishment and amusement of the men he plunged his head into the cold water and splashed his neck and ears.
'is it the custom in your land to wash the head before supper? ' said the man who waited on the hobbits.
`no, before breakfast,' said sam. `but if you're short of sleep cold water on the neck's like rain on a wilted lettuce. there! now i can keep awake long enough to eat a bit.'
they were led then to seats beside faramir: barrels covered with pelts and high enough above the benches of the men for their convenience. before they ate, faramir and all his men turned and faced west in a moment of silence. faramir signed to frodo and sam that they should do likewise.
'so we always do.' he said, as they sat down: `we look towards númen

 '
`no,' said frodo, feeling strangely rustic and untutored. `but if we are guests, we bow to our host, and after we have eaten we rise and thank him.'
'that we do also,' said faramir.
after so long journeying and camping, and days spent ¤n the lonely wild, the evening meal seemed a feast to the hobbits: to drink pale yellow wine, cool and fragrant, and eat bread and butter, and salted meats, and dried fruits, and good red cheese, with clean hands and clean knives and plates. neither frodo nor sam refused anything that was offered, nor a second, nor indeed a third helping. the wine coursed in their veins and tired limbs, and they felt glad and easy of heart as they had not done since they left the land of lórien.
when all was done faramir led them to a recess at the back of the cave, partly screened by curtains; and a chair and two stools were brought there. a little earthenware lamp burned in a niche.
`you may soon desire to sleep,' he said, 'and especially good samwise, who would not

frodo no longer felt sleepy and he was willing to talk. but though the food and wine had put him at his ease, he had not lost all his caution. sam was beaming and humming to himself, but when frodo spoke he was at first content to listen, only occasionally venturing to make an exclamation of agreement.
frodo told many tales, yet always he steered the matter away from the quest of the company and from the ring, enlarging rather on the valiant part boromir had played in all their adventures. with the wolves of the wild, in the snows under caradhras, and in the mines of moria where gandalf fell. faramir was most moved by the story of the fig

rned what they would, and their lords speak our speech at need; yet for the most part they hold by the ways of their own fathers and to their own memories, and they speak among themselves their own north tongue. and we love them: tall men and fair women, valiant both alike, golden-haired, bright-eyed, and strong; they remind us of the youth of men, as they were in the elder days. indeed it is said by our lore-masters that they have from of old this affinity with us that they are come from those same three houses of men as were the númenoreans in their beginning not from hador the goldenhaired, the elf-friend, maybe, yet from such of his sons and people as went not over sea into the west, refusing the call.
'for so we reckon men in our lore, calling them the high, or men of the west, which were númenoreans; and the middle peoples, men of the twilight, such as are the rohirrim and their kin that dwell still far in the north; and the wild, the men of darkness.

aft of weapons and slaying, we esteem a warrior, nonetheless, above men of other crafts. such is the need of our days. so even was my brother, boromir: a man of prowess, and for that he was accounted the best man in gondor. and very valiant indeed he was: no heir of minas tirith has for long years been so hardy in toil, so onward into battle, or blown a mightier note on the great horn.' faramir sighed and fell silent for a while.
`you don't say much in all your tales about the elves, sir,' said sam, suddenly plucking up courage. he had noted that faramir seemed to refer to elves with reverence, and this even more than his courtesy, and his food and wine, had won sam's respect and quieted his suspicions.
`no indeed, master samwise,' said faramir, `for i am not learned in elven-lore. but there you touch upon another point in which we have changed, declining from númenor to middle-earth. for as you may know, if mithrandir was your companion and you have spoken with elrond, the edain, the fa

`yet there are among us still some who have dealings with the elves when they may, and ever and anon one will go in secret to lórien, seldom to return. not i. for i deem it perilous now for mortal man wilfully to seek out the elder people. yet i envy you that have spoken with the white lady.'
`the lady of lórien! galadriel!' cried sam. `you should see her indeed you should, sir. i am only a hobbit, and gardening's my job at home, sir, if you understand me, and i'm not much good at poetry - not at making it: a bit of a comic rhyme, perhaps. now and again, you know, but not real poetry - so i can't tell you what i mean. it ought to be sung. you'd have to get strider, aragorn that is, or old mr. bilbo, for that. but i wish i could make a song about her. beautiful she is, sir! lovely! sometimes like a great tree in flower, somet

'then she must be lovely indeed,' said faramir. `perilously fair.'
`i don't know about perilous,' said sam. `it strikes me that folk takes their peril with them into lórien, and finds it there because they've brought it. but perhaps you could call her perilous, because she's so strong in herself. you, you could dash yourself to pieces on her, like a ship on a rock; or drownd yourself, like a hobbit in a river. but neither rock nor river would be to blame. now boro - ' he stopped and went red in the face.

`yes sir, begging your pardon, and a fine man as your brother was if i may say so. but you've been warm on the scent all along. now i watched boromir and listened to him, from rivendell all down the road - looking after my master, as you'll understand, and not meaning any harm to boromir - and it's my opinion that in lórien he first saw clearly what i guessed sooner: what he wanted. from the moment he first saw it he wanted the enemy's ring!

`sam! ' cried frodo aghast. he had fallen deep into his own thoughts for a while, and came out of them suddenly and too late.
'save me! ' said sam turning white, and then flushing scarlet. `there i go again! when ever you open your big mouth you put your foot in it the gaffer used to say to me, and right enough. o dear, o dear!
`now look here, sir! ' he turned, facing up to faramir with all the courage that he could muster. `don't you go taking advantage of my master because his servant's no better

lowly and very softly, with a strange smile. `so that is the answer to all the riddles! the one ring that was thought to have perished from the world. and boromir tried to take it by force? and you escaped? and ran all the way - to me! and here in the wild i have you: two halflings, and a host of men at my call, and the ring of rings. a pretty stroke of fortune! a chance for faramir, captain of gondor, to show his quality! ha!' he stood up, very tall and stern, his grey eyes glinting.
frodo and sam sprang from their stools and set themselves side by side with their backs to the wall, fumbling for their sword-hilts. there was a silence. all the men in the cave stopped talking and looked towards them in wonder. but faramir sat down again in his chair and began to laugh quietly, and then suddenly became grave again.
'alas for boromir! it was too sore a trial! ' he said. `how you have increased my sorrow, you two strange wanderers from a far country, bearing the peril of men! but you are less

the hobbits came back to their seats and sat very quiet. men turned back to their drink and their talk, perceiving tha

'i was going to find a way into mordor,' he said faintly. `i was going to gorgoroth. i must find the mountain of fire and cast the thing into the gulf of doom. gandalf said so. i do not think i shall ever get there.'
faramir stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment. then suddenly he caught him as he swayed, and lifting him gently, carried him to the bed and laid him there, and covered him warmly. at once he fell into a deep sleep.
another bed was set beside him for his servant. sam hesitated for a moment, then bowing very low: `good night, captain, my lord,' he said. `you took the chance, sir.'
`did i so?' said faramir.
`yes sir, and showed your quality: the very highest.'
faramir smiled. 'a pert servant, master samwise. but nay: the praise of the praiseworthy is above all rewards. yet there was naught in this to praise. i had no lure or desire to do other than i have done.'
`ah well, sir,' said sam, `you said my master had an elvish air and that was good and true. but i

'is it morning already? ' said frodo yawning.
`not yet, but night is drawing to an end, and the full moon is setting. will you come and see it? also there is a matter on which i desire your counsel. i am sorry to rouse you from sleep, but will you come? '
`i will,' said frodo, rising and shivering a little as he left the warm blanket and pelts. it seemed cold in the fireless cave. the noise of the water was loud in the stillness. he put on his cloak and followed faramir.
sam, waking suddenly by some instinct of watchfulness, saw first his master's empty bed and leapt to his feet. then he saw two dark figures, frodo and a man, framed against the archway, which was now filled with a pale white light. he hurried after them, past rows of men sleeping on mattresses along the wall. as he went by the cave-mouth he saw that the curtain was now become a dazzling veil of silk and pearls and silver thread: melting icicles of moonlight. but he did not pause to admire it, and t

ol night-waters of the anduin. a black darkness loomed beyond, and in it glinted, here and there, cold, sharp, remote, white as the teeth of ghosts, the peaks of ered nimrais, the white mountains of the realm of gondor, tipped with everlasting snow.
for a while frodo stood there on the high stone, and a shiver ran through him, wondering if anywhere in the vastness of the night-lands his old companions walked or slept, or lay dead shrouded in mist. why was he brought here out of forgetful sleep?
sam was eager for an answer to the same question and could not refrain himself from muttering, for his master's ear alone as he thought: 'it's a fine view, no doubt, mr. frodo, but chilly to the heart, not to mention the bones! what's going on? '
faramir heard and answered. `moonset over gondor. fair ithil as he goes from middle-earth, glances upon the white locks of old mindolluin. it is worth a few shivers. but that is not what i brought you to see-though as for you, samwise, you were not brought

he stepped up beside the silent sentinel on the dark edge. and frodo followed. sam hung back. he already felt insecure enough on this high wet platform. faramir and frodo looked down. far below them they saw the white waters pour into a foaming bowl, and then swirl darkly about a deep oval basin in the rocks. until they found their way out again through a narrow gate, and flowed away, fuming and chattering, into calmer and more level reaches. the moonlight still slanted down to the fall's foot and gleamed on the ripples of the basin. presently frodo was aware of a small dark

`shall we shoot? ' said faramir, turning quickly to frodo.
frodo did not answer for a moment. then `no! ' he said. `no! i beg you not to.' if sam had dared, he would have said `yes,' quicker and louder. he could not see, but he guessed well enough from their words what they were looking at.
'you know, then, what this thing is? ' said faramir. `come, now you have seen, tell me why it should be spared. in all our words together you have not once spoken of your gangrel companion, and i let him be for the time. he could wait till he was caught and brought before me. i sent my keenest huntsmen to seek him, but he slipped them, and they had no

gollum turned and spat at him. the men picked him up, put a hood over his eyes, and carried him off.
frodo followed them, feeling very wretched. they went through the opening behind the bushes. and back, down the stairs and passages, into the cave. two or three torches had been lit. men were stirring. sam was there, and he gave a queer look at the limp bundle that the men carried. `got him?' he said to frodo.
'yes. well no, i didn't get him. he came to me, because he trusted me at first, i'm afraid. i did not want him tied up like this. i hope it will be all right; but i hate the whole business.'
`so do i,' said sam. `and nothing will ever be all right where that piece of misery is.'
a man came and beckoned to the hobbits, and took them to the recess at the back of the cave. faramir was sitting

frodo bowed low. 'i am answered,' he said, `and i place myself at your service, if that is of any worth to one so high and honourable.'
`it is of great worth,' said faramir. 'and now, do you take this creature, this sméagol, under your protection? '
`i do take sméagol under my protection,' said frodo. sam sighed audibly; and not at the courtesies, of which, as any hobbit would, he thoroughly approved. indeed in the shire such a matter would have required a great many more words and bows.
'then i say to you,' said faramir, turning to gollum, 'you are under doom of death; but while you walk with frodo you are safe for our part. yet if ever you be found by any man of gondor astray without him, the doom shall fall. and may death find you swiftly, within gondor or without, if you do not well serve hi

he rose and bowed low to frodo, and drawing the curtain passed out into the cave.

journey to the cross-roads

frodo and sam returned to their beds and lay there in silence resting for a little, while men bestirred themselves and the business of the day began. after a while water was brought to them, and then they were led to a table where food was set for three. faramir broke his fast with them. he had not slept since the battle on the day before, yet he did not look weary.
when they had finished they stood up. `may no hunger trouble you on the road,' said faramir. `you have little provision, but some small store of

o, 'it was said to me by elrond halfelven that i should find friendship upon the way, secret and unlooked for. certainly i looked for no such friendship as you have shown. to have found it turns evil to great good.'
now they made ready to depart. gollum was brought out of some corner or hiding-hole, and he seemed better pleased with himself than he had been, though he kept close to frodo and avoided the glance of faramir.
'your guide must be blindfolded,' said faramir, 'but you and your servant samwise i release from this, if you wish.'
gollum squealed, and squirmed, and clutched at frodo, when they came to bind his eyes; and frodo said: 'blindfold us all three, and cover up my eyes first, and then perhaps he will see that no harm is meant.' this was done, and they were led from the cave of henneth annûn. after they had passed the passages and stairs they felt the cool morning air, fresh and sweet, about them. still blind they went on for some little time, up and then gently down. at las

. then he turned and without looking back he left them and went to his two guards that stood at a little distance away. they marvelled to see with what speed these green-clad men now moved, vanishing almost in the twinkling of an eye. the forest where faramir had stood seemed empty and drear, as if a dream had passed.
frodo sighed and turned back southward. as if to mark his disregard of all such courtesy, gollum was scrabbling in the mould at the foot of a tree. `hungry again already?' thought sam. `well, now for it again!'
'have they gone at last? ' said gollum. `nassty wicked men! sméagol's neck still hurts him, yes it does. let's go! '
`yes, let us go,' said frodo. `but if you can only speak ill of those who showed you mercy, keep silent! '
`nice master! ' said gollum. `sméagol was only joking. always forgives, he does, yes, yes, even nice master's little trickses. oh yes, nice master, nice sméagol! '
frodo and sam did not answer. hoisting their packs and taking their staves in han

e nothing.
the sun rose and passed overhead unseen, and began to sink, and the light through the trees to the west grew golden; and always they walked in cool green shadow, and all about them was silence. the birds seemed all to have flown away or to have fallen dumb.
darkness came early to the silent woods, and before the fall of night they halted, weary, for they had walked seven leagues or more from henneth annûn. frodo lay and slept away the night on the deep mould beneath an ancient tree. sam beside him was more uneasy: he woke many times, but there was never a sign of gollum, who had slipped off as soon as the others had settled to rest. whether he had slept by himself in some hole nearby, or had wandered restlessly prowling through the night, he did not say; but he returned with the first glimmer of light, and roused his companions.
`must get up, yes they must!' he said. 'long ways to go still, south and east. hobbits must make haste!'
that day passed much as the day before had go

that eyes could not see. frodo shuddered as he looked again at the distant pinnacles now dwindling into night, and the sound of the water seemed cold and cruel: the voice of morgulduin, the polluted stream that flowed from the valley of the wraiths.
'what shall we do? ' he said. 'we have walked long and far. shall we look for some place in the woods behind where we can lie hidden? '
'no good hiding in the dark,' said gollum. 'it's in day that hobbits must hide now, yes in day.'
`oh come! ' said sam. 'we must rest for a bit, even if we get up again in the middle of the night. there'll still be hours of dark then time enough for you to take us a long march, if you know the way.'
gollum reluctantly agreed to this, and he turned back towards the trees, working eastward for a while along the straggling edges of the wood. he would not rest on the ground so near the evil road, and after some debate they all climbed up into the crotch of a large holm-oak, whose thick branches springing together f

rom the trunk made a good hiding-place and a fairly comfortable refuge. night fell and it grew altogether dark under the canopy of the tree. frodo and sam drank a little water and ate some bread and dried fruit, but gollum at once curled up and went to sleep. the hobbits did not shut their eyes.
it must have been a little after midnight when gollum woke up: suddenly they were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gleaming at them. he listened and sniffed, which seemed, as they had noticed before, his usual method of discovering the time of night.
'are we rested? have we had beautiful sleep?' he said. 'let's go!'
'we aren't, and we haven't,' growled sam

between, the mountains of the ephel dúath frowned at them, black and shapeless below where night lay thick and did not pass away, above with jagged tops and edges outlined hard and menacing against the fiery glow. away to their right a great shoulder of the mountains stood out, dark and black amid the shadows, thrusting westward.
`which way do we go from here?' asked frodo. `is that the opening of-of the morgul valley, away over there beyond that black mass?'
`need we think about it yet?' said sam, `surely we're not going to move any more today, if day it is?'
`perhaps not, perhaps not,' said gollum. `but we must go soon, to the cross-roads. yes, to the cross-roads. that's the way over there yes, master.'
the red glare over mordor died away. the twilight deepened as great vapours rose in the east and crawled above them. frodo and sam took a little food and then lay down, but gollum was restless. he would not eat any of their food, but he drank a little water and then crawled about under

`off hunting, i suppose,' said sam and yawned. it was his turn to sleep first, and he was soon deep in a dream. he thought he was back in the bag end garden looking for something; but he had a heavy pack on his back, which made him stoop. it all seemed very weedy and rank somehow, and thorns and bracken were invading the beds down near the bottom hedge.
`a job of work for me, i can see; but i'm so tired,' he kept on saying. presently he remembered what he was looking for. `my pipe!' he said, and with that he woke up.

his pack but he had no leaf, and next that he was hundreds of miles from bag end. he sat up. it seemed to be almost dark. why had his master let him sleep on out of turn, right on till evening?
`haven't you had no sleep, mr. frodo?' he said. 'what's the time? seems to be getting late!'
'no it isn't,' said frodo. `but the day is getting darker instead of lighter: darker and darker. as far as i can tell, it isn't midday yet, and you've only slept for about three hours.'
'i wonder what's up,' said sam. 'is there a storm coming? if so it's going to be the worst there ever was. we shall wish we were down a deep hole, not just stuck under a hedge.' he listened. `what's that? thunder, or drums, or what is it? '
'i don't know,' said frodo. `it's been going on for a good while now. sometimes the ground seems to tremble, sometimes it seems to be the heavy air throbbing in your ears.'
sam looked round. `where's gollum? ' he said. 'hasn't he come back yet?'
`no,' said frodo. `there's not been a sign

or sound of him.'
`well, i can't abide him,' said sam. `in fact, i've never taken anything on a journey that i'd have been less sorry to lose on the way. but it would be just like him, after coming all these miles, to go and get lost now, just when we shall need him most - that is, if he's ever going to be any use, which i doubt.'
`you forget the marshes,' said frodo. `i hope nothing has happened to him.'
`and i hope he's up to no tricks. and anyway i hope he doesn't fall into other hands, as you might say. because if he does, we shall soon be in

for trouble.'
at that moment a rolling and rumbling noise was heard again, louder now and deeper. the ground seemed to quiver under their feet. 'i think we are in for trouble anyhow,' said frodo. `i'm afraid our journey is drawing to an end.'
'maybe,' said sam; `but where there's life there's hope, as my gaffer used to say; and need of vittles, as he mostways used to add. you have a bite, mr. frodo, and then a bit of sleep.'
the afternoon, as sam supposed it must be called, wore on. looking out from the covert he could see only a dun, shadowless world, fading slowly into a featureless, colourless gloom. it felt stifling but not warm. frodo slept unquietly, turning and tossing, and sometimes murmuring. twice sam thought he heard him speaking gandalf's name. the time seemed to drag interminably. suddenly sam heard a hiss behind him, and there was gollum on all fours, peering at them with gleaming eyes.

sam stared at him suspiciously: he seemed frightened or excited. `go now? what's your little game? it isn't time yet. it can't be tea-time even, leastways not in decent places where there is tea-time.'
`silly! ' hissed gollum. `we're not in decent places. time's running short, yes, running fast. no time to lose. we must go. wake up. master, wake u he clawed at frodo; and frodo, startled out of sleep, sat up suddenly and seized him by the arm. gollum tore himself loose and backed away.

very stealthily gollum led them down the hillside, keeping under cover wherever it was possible, and running, almost bent to the ground, across any open space; but the light was now so dim that even a keen-eyed beast of the wild could scarcely have seen the hobbits, hooded, in their grey cloaks, nor heard the

ky; and the spaces between their immense boles were like the great dark arches of some ruined hall. in the very centre four ways met. behind them lay the road to the morannon; before them it ran out again upon its long journey south; to their right the road from old osgiliath came climbing up, and crossing, passed out eastward into darkness: the fourth way, the road they were to take.
standing there for a moment filled with dread frodo became aware that a light was shining; he saw it glowing on sam's face beside him. turning towards it, he saw, beyond an arch of boughs, the road to osgiliath running almost as straight as a stretched ribbon down, down, into the west. there, far away, beyond sad gondor now overwhelmed in shade, the sun was sinking, finding at last the hem of the great slow-rolling pall of cloud, and falling in an ominous fire towards the yet unsullied sea. the brief glow fell upon a huge sitting figure, still and solemn as the great stone kings of argonath. the years had gn

d it, and violent hands had maimed it. its head was gone, and in its place was set in mockery a round rough-hewn stone, rudely painted by savage hands in the likeness of a grinning face with one large red eye in the midst of its forehead. upon its knees and mighty chair, and all about the pedestal, were idle scrawls mixed with the foul symbols that the maggot-folk of mordor used.
suddenly, caught by the level beams, frodo saw the old king's head: it was lying rolled away by the roadside. `look, sam!' he cried, startled into speech. `look! the king has got a crown again!'
the eyes were hollow and the carven beard was broken, but about the high stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold. a trailing plant with flowers like small white stars had bound itself across the brows as if in reverence for the fallen king, and in the crevices of his stony hair yellow stonecrop gleamed.
'they cannot conquer for ever!' said frodo. and then suddenly the brief glimpse was gone. the sun dipped a

s his guide led him, out into the darkness of the east. they left the ring of trees and crept along the road towards the mountains. this road, too, ran straight for a while, but soon it began to bend away southwards, until it came right under the great shoulder of rock that they had seen from the distance. black and forbidding it loomed above them, darker than the dark sky behind. crawling under its shadow the road went on, and rounding it sprang east again and began to climb steeply.
frodo and sam were plodding along with heavy hearts, no longer able to care greatly about their peril. frodo's head was bowed; his burden was dragging him down again. as soon as the great cross-roads had been passed, the weight of it, almost forgotten in ithilien, had begun to grow once more. now, feeling the way become steep before his feet, he looked wearily up; and then he saw it, even as gollum had said that he would: the city of the ringwraiths. he cowered against the stony bank.

idge sprang. figures stood there at its head, carven with cunning in forms human and bestial, but all corrupt and loathsome. the water flowing beneath was silent, and it steamed, but the vapour that rose from it, curling and twisting about the bridge, was deadly cold. frodo felt his senses reeling and his mind darkening. then suddenly, as if some force were at work other than his own will, he began to hurry, tottering forward, his groping hands held out, his head lolling from side to side. both sam and gollum ran after him. sam caught his master in his arms, as he stumbled and almost fell, right on the threshold of the bridge.
`not that way! no, not that way! ' whispered gollum, but the breath between his teeth seemed to tear the heavy stillness like a whistle, and he cowered to the ground in terror.
`hold up, mr. frodo! ' muttered sam in frodo's ear. 'come back! not that way. gollum says not, and for once i agree with him.'
frodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenched his eyes away f

rom the city on the hill. the luminous tower fascinated him, and he fought the desire that was on him to run up the gleaming road towards its gate. at last with an effort he turned back, and as he did so, he felt the ring resisting him, dragging at the chain about his neck; and his eyes too, as he looked away, seemed for the moment to have been blinded. the darkness before him was impenetrable.
gollum, crawling on the ground like a frightened animal, was already vanishing into the gloom. sam, supporting and guiding his stumbling master, followed after him as quickly as he could. not far from the near bank of the stream there was a gap in the stone-wall beside the road. through this they passed, and sam saw that they were on a narrow path that gleamed faintly at first, as the main road did, until climbing above the meads of deadly flowers it faded and went dark, winding its crooked way up into the northern sides of the valley.
along this path the hobbits trudged, side by side, unabl

e to see gollum in front of them, except when he turned back to beckon them on. then his eyes shone with a green-white light, reflecting the noisome morgul-sheen perhaps, or kindled by some answering mood within. of that deadly gleam and of the dark eyeholes frodo and sam were always conscious, ever glancing fearfully over their shoulders, and ever dragging their eyes back to find the darkening path. slowly they laboured on. as they rose above the stench and vapours of the poisonous stream their breath became easier and their heads clearer; but now their limbs were deadly tired, as if they had walked all night under a burden, or had been swimming long against a heavy tide of water. at last they could go no further without a halt.

stone. they had now climbed up to the top of a great hump of bare rock. ahead of them there was a bay in the valley-side, and round the head of this the path went on, no more than a wide ledge with a chasm on the right; across the sheer southward face of the mountain it crawled upwards, until it disappeared into the blackness above.
`i must rest a while, sam,' whispered frodo. `it's heavy on me, sam lad, very heavy. i wonder how far i can carry it? anyway i must rest before we venture on to that.' he pointed to the narrow way ahead.
`sssh! ssh! ' hissed gollum hurrying back to them. `sssh! ' his fingers were on his lips and he shook his head urgently. tugging at frodo's sleeve, he pointed towards the path; but frodo would not move.
`not yet,' he said, 'not yet.' weariness and more than weariness oppressed him; it seemed as if a heavy spell was laid on his mind and body. `i must rest,' he m

at this gollum's fear and agitation became so great that he spoke again, hissing behind his hand, as if to keep the sound from unseen listeners in the air. `not here, no. not rest here. fools! eyes can see us. when they come to the bridge they will see us. come away! climb, climb! come! '
`come, mr. frodo,' said sam. `he's right, again. we can't stay here.'
'all right,' said frodo in a remote voice, as of one speaking half asleep. `i will try.' wearily he got to his feet.
but it was too late. at that moment the rock quivered and trembled beneath them. the great rumbling noise, louder than ever before, rolled in the ground and echoed in the mountains. then with searing suddenness there came a great red flash. far beyond the eastern mountains it leapt into the sky and splashed the lowering clouds with crimso

then at a great distance, as if it came out of memories of the shire, some sunlit early morning, when the day called and doors were opening, he heard sam's voice speaking. `wake up, mr. frodo! wake up! ' had the voice added: `your breakfast is ready,' he would hardly have been surprised. certainly sam was urgent. `wake up, mr. frodo! they're gone,' he said.
there was a dull clang. the gates of minas morgul had closed. the last rank of spears had vanished down the road. the tower still grinned across the valley, but the light was fading in it. the whole city was falling back into a dark brooding shade, and silence. yet still it was filled with wa

d not last long. soon the path reached a rounded angle where the mountain-side swelled out again, and there it suddenly entered a narrow opening in the rock. they had come to the first stair that gollum had spoken of. the darkness was almost complete, and they could see nothing much beyond their hands' stretch; but gollum's eyes shone pale, several feet above, as he turned back towards them.
`careful! ' he whispered. `steps. lots of steps. must be careful! '
care was certainly needed. frodo and sam at first felt easier, having now a wall on either side, but the stairway was almost as steep as a ladder, and as they climbed up and up, they became more and more aware of the long black fall behind them. and the steps were narrow, spaced unevenly, and often treacherous: they were worn and smooth at the edges, and some were broken, and some cracked as foot was set upon them. the hobbits struggled on, until at last they were clinging with desperate fingers to the steps ahead, and forcing their a

ching knees to bend and straighten; and ever as the stair cut its way deeper into the sheer mountain the rocky walls rose higher and higher above their heads.
at length, just as they felt that they could endure no more, they saw gollum's eyes peering down at them again. `we're up,' he whispered. 'first stair's past. clever hobbits to climb so high, very clever hobbits. just a few more little steps and that's all, yes.'
dizzy and very tired sam, and frodo following him, crawled up the last step, and sat down rubbing their legs and knees. they were in a deep dark passage that seemed still to go up before them, though at a gentler slope and without steps. gollum did not let them rest long.
'there's another stair still,' he said. `much longer stair. rest when we get to the top of next stair. not yet.'
sam groaned. 'longer, did you say? ' he asked.
'yes, yess, longer,' said gollum. `but not so difficult. hobbits have climbed the straight

stair. next comes the winding stair.'
'and what after that? ' said sam.
`we shall see,' said gollum softly. `o yes, we shall see! '
'i thought you said there was a tunnel,' said sam. `isn't there a tunnel or something to go through? '
'o yes, there's a tunnel,' said gollum. `but hobbits can rest before they try that. if they get through that, they'll be nearly at the top. very nearly, if they get through. o yes! '
frodo shivered. the climb had made him sweat, but now he felt cold and clammy, and there was a chill draught in the dark passage, blowing down from the invisible heights above. he got up and shook himself. `well, let's go on! ' he said. `this is no place to sit i

er side, like pillars holding up a vast sagging roof. they seemed to have climbed up many hundreds of feet, on to a wide shelf. a cliff was on their left and a chasm on their right.
gollum led the way close under the cliff. for the present they were no longer climbing, but the ground was now more broken and dangerous in the dark, and there were blocks and lumps of fallen stone in the way. their going was slow and cautious. how many hours had passed since they had entered the morgul vale neither sam nor frodo could any longer guess. the night seemed endless.
at length they were once more aware of a wall looming up, and once more a stairway opened before them. again they halted, and again they began to climb. it was a long and weary ascent; but this stairway did not delve into the mountain-side. here the huge cliff face sloped backwards, and the path like a snake wound to and fro across it. at one point it crawled sideways right to the edge of the dark chasm, and frodo glancing down saw bel

g up, saw, as he guessed, the very crown of this bitter road. against the sullen redness of the eastern sky a cleft was outlined in the topmost ridge, narrow, deep-cloven between two black shoulders; and on either shoulder was a horn of stone.
he paused and looked more attentively. the horn upon the left was tall and slender; and in it burned a red light, or else the red light in the land beyond was shining through a hole. he saw now: it was a black tower poised above the outer pass. he touched sam's arm and pointed.
'i don't like the look of that! ' said sam. `so this secret way of yours is guarded after all,' he growled, turning to gollum. 'as you knew all along, i suppose? '
'all ways are watched, yes,' said gollum. `of course they are. but hobbits must try some way. this may be least watched. perhaps they've all gone away to big battle, perhaps! '
'perhaps,' grunted sam. 'well, it still seems a long way off, and a long way up before we get there. and there's still the tunnel. i think

ap.' for so he felt it to be. the terrors of the land beyond, and the deed to be done there, seemed remote, too far off yet to trouble him. all his mind was bent on getting through or over this impenetrable wall and guard. if once he could do that impossible thing, then somehow the errand would be accomplished, or so it seemed to him in that dark hour of weariness, still labouring in the stony shadows under cirith ungol.
in a dark crevice between two great piers of rock they sat down: frodo and sam a little way within. and gollum crouched upon the ground near the opening. there the hobbits took what they expected would be their last meal before they went down into the nameless land, maybe the last meal they would ever eat together. some of the food of gondor they ate, and wafers of the waybread of the elves. and they drank a little. but of their water they were sparing and took only enough to moisten their dry mouths.
`i wonder when we'll find water again? ' said sam. 'but i suppose even

over there they drink? orcs drink, don't they? '
'yes, they drink,' said frodo. 'but do not let us speak of that. such drink is not for us.'
`then all the more need to fill our bottles,' said sam. `but there isn't any water up here: not a sound or a trickle have i heard. and anyway faramir said we were not to drink any water in morgul.'
'no water flowing out of imlad morgul, were his words,' said frodo. `we are not in that valley now, and if we came on a spring it would be flowing into it and not out of it.'
'i wouldn't trust it,' said sam, 'not till i was dying of thirst. there's a wicked feeling about this place.' he sniffed. 'and a smell, i fancy. do you notice it? a queer kind of a

smell, stuffy. i don't like it.'
'i don't like anything here at all.' said frodo, `step or stone, breath or bone. earth, air and water all seem accursed. but so our path is laid.'
'yes, that's so,' said sam. `and we shouldn't be here at all, if we'd known more about it before we started. but i suppose it's often that way. the brave things in the old tales and songs, mr. frodo: adventures, as i used to call them. i used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the stories went out and looked for, because they wanted them, because they were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might say. but that's not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones

stay in the mind. folk seem to have been just landed in them, usually - their paths were laid that way, as you put it. but i expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn't. and if they had, we shouldn't know, because they'd have been forgotten. we hear about those as just went on - and not all to a good end, mind you; at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end. you know, coming home, and finding things all right, though not quite the same - like old mr bilbo. but those aren't always the best tales to hear, though they may be the best tales to get landed in! i wonder what sort of a tale we've fallen into? '
`i wonder,' said frodo. 'but i don't know. and that's the way of a real tale. take any one that you're fond of. you may know, or guess, what kind of a tale it is, happy-ending or sad-ending, but the people in it don't know. and you don't want them to.'
'no, sir, of course not. beren now, he never thought he was going to get t

'
'no, they never end as tales,' said frodo. `but the people in them come, and go when their part's ended. our part will end later - or sooner.'
'and then we can have some rest and some sleep,' said sam. he laughed grimly. 'and i mean just that, mr. frodo. i mean plain ordinary rest, and sleep, and waking up to a morning's work in the garden. i'm afraid that's all i'm hoping for all the time. all the big important plans are not for my

`it's saying a lot too much,' said frodo, and he laughed, a long clear laugh from his heart. such a sound had not been heard in those places since sauron came to middle-earth. to sam suddenly it seemed as if all the stones were listening and the tall rocks leaning over them. but frodo did not heed them; he laughed again. 'why, sam,' he said, 'to hear you somehow makes me as merry as if the story was already written. but you've left out one of the chief characters: samwise the stouthearted. "i want to hear more about sam, dad. why didn't they put in more of his talk, dad? that's what i like, it makes me laugh. and frodo wouldn't have got far without sam, would he, dad? " '

`so was i,' said frodo, 'and so i am. we're going on a bit too fast. you and i, sam, are still stuck in the worst places of the story, and it is all too likely that some will say at this point: "shut the book now, dad; we don't want to read any more." '
`maybe,' said sam, 'but i wouldn't be one to say that. things done and over and made into part of the great tales are different. why, even gollum might be good in a tale, better than he is to have by you, anyway. and he used to like tales himself once, by his own account. i wonder if he thinks he's the hero or the villain?
`gollum!' he called. `would you like to be the hero - now where's he got to again?'
there was no sign of him at the mouth of their shelter nor in the shadows near. he had refused their food, t

hough he had, as usual, accepted a mouthful of water; and then he had seemed to curl up for a sleep: they had supposed that one at any rate of his objects in his long absence the day before had been to hunt for food to his own liking; and now he had evidently slipped off again while they talked. but what for this time?
`i don't like his sneaking off without saying,' said sam. 'and least of all now. he can't be looking for food up here, not unless there's some kind of rock he fancies. why, there isn't even a bit of moss! '
`it's no good worrying about him now,' said frodo. `we couldn't have got so far, not even within sight of the pass, without him, and so we'll have to put up with his ways. if he's false, he's false.'
'all the same, i'd rather have him under my eye,' said sam. 'all the more so, if he's false. do you remember he never would say if this pass was guar

on't think so,' answered frodo. 'even if he's up to some wickedness, and i suppose that's not unlikely, i don't think it's that: not to fetch orcs, or any servants of the enemy. why wait till now, and go through all the labour of the climb, and come so near the land he fears? he could probably have betrayed us to orcs many times since we met him. no, if it's anything, it will be some little private trick of his own-that he thinks is quite secret.'
`well, i suppose you're right, mr. frodo,' said sam. 'not that it comforts me mightily. i don't make no mistake: i don't doubt he'd hand me over to orcs as gladly as kiss his hand. but i was forgetting - his precious. no, i suppose the whole time it's been the precious for poor sméagol. that's the one idea in all his little schemes, if he has any. but how bringing us up here will help him in that is more than i can guess.'
'very likely he can't guess himself,' said frodo. `and i don't think he's got just one plain scheme in his muddled head. i

think he really is in part trying to save the precious from the enemy. as long as he can. for that would be the last disaster for himself too. if the enemy got it. and in the other part, perhaps, he's just biding his time and waiting on chance.'
'yes, slinker and stinker, as i've said before,' said sam. 'but the nearer they get to the enemy's land the more like stinker slinker will get. mark my words: if ever we get to the pass, he won't let us really take the precious thing over the border without making some kind of trouble.'
`we haven't got there yet,' said frodo.
'no, but we'd better keep our eyes skinned till we do. if we're caught napping, stinker will come out on top pretty quick. not but what it would be safe for you to have a wink now, master. safe, if you lay close to me. i'd be dea

`sleep!' said frodo and sighed, as if out of a desert he had seen a mirage of cool green. 'yes, even here i could sleep.'
`sleep then, master! lay your head in my lap.'
and so gollum found them hours later, when he returned, crawling and creeping down the path out of the gloom ahead. sam sat propped against the stone, his head dropping sideways and his breathing heavy. in his lap lay frodo's head, drowned deep in sleep; upon his white forehead lay one of sam's brown hands, and the other lay softly upon his master's breast. peace was in both their faces.
gollum looked at them. a strange expression passed over his lean hungry face. the gleam faded from his eyes, and they went dim and grey, old and tired. a spasm of pain seemed to twist him, and he turned away, peering back up tow

en he came back, and slowly putting out a trembling hand, very cautiously he touched frodo's knee - but almost the touch was a caress. for a fleeting moment, could one of the sleepers have seen him, they would have thought that they beheld an old weary hobbit, shrunken by the years that had carried him far beyond his time, beyond friends and kin, and the fields and streams of youth, an old starved pitiable thing.
but at that touch frodo stirred and cried out softly in his sleep, and immediately sam was wide awake. the first thing he saw was gollum - `pawing at master,' as he thought.
`hey you!' he said roughly. `what are you up to?'
'nothing, nothing,' said gollum softly. `nice master!'
`i daresay,' said sam. 'but where have you been to - sneaking off and sneaking back, you old villain? '
gollum withdrew himself, and a green glint flickered under his heavy lids. almost spider-like he looked now, crouched back on his bent limbs, with his protruding eyes. the fleeting moment had passed, bey

'hobbits always so polite, yes. o nice hobbits! sméagol brings them up secret ways that nobody else could find. tired he is, thirsty he is, yes thirsty; and he guides them and he searches for paths, and they say sneak, sneak. very nice friends, o yes my precious, very nice.'
sam felt a bit remorseful, though not more trustful. 'sorry.' he said. 'i'm sorry, but you startled me out of my sleep. and i shouldn't have been sleeping, and that made me a bit sharp. but mr. frodo. he's that tired, i asked him to have a wink; and well, that's how it is. sorry. but where have you been to?

'it's tomorrow,' said gollum, 'or this was tomorrow when hobbits went to sleep. very foolish, very dangerous-if poor sméagol wasn't sneaking about to watch.'
`i think we shall get tired of that word soon,' said sam. 'but never mind. i'll wake master up.' gently he smoothed the hair back from frodo's brow, and bending down spoke softly to him.
`wake up, mr. frodo! wake up! '
frodo stirred and opened his eyes, and smiled, seeing sam's face bending over him. `calling me early aren't you, sam?' he said. `it's dark still! '
'yes it's always dark here,' said sam. `but gollum's come back mr. frodo, and he says it's tomorrow. so we must be walking on. the last lap.'
frodo drew a deep breath and sat up. `the last lap! ' he said. 'hullo, sméagol! found any food? have you had any rest? '
`no food, no rest, nothing for sméagol,' said gollum. `he's a sneak.'
sam clicked his tongue, but restrained himself.

`sméagol has to take what's given him,' answered gollum. 'he was given that name by kind master samwise, the hobbit that knows so much.'
frodo looked at sam. 'yes sir,' he said. `i did use the word, waking up out of my sleep sudden and all and finding him at hand. i said i was sorry, but i soon shan't be.'
'come, let it pass then,' said frodo. 'but now we seem to have come to the point, you and i, sméagol. tell me. can we find the rest of the way by ourselves? we're in sight of the pass, of a way in, and if we can find it now, then i suppose our agreement can be said to be over. you have done what you promised, and you're free: free to go back to

they passed on, gollum in front and the hobbits now side by side, up the long ravine between the piers and columns of torn and weathered rock, standing like huge unshapen statues on either hand. there was no sound. some way ahead, a mile or so, perhaps, was a great grey wall, a last huge upthrusting mass of mountain-stone. darker it loomed, and steadily it rose as they approached, until it towered up high above them, shutting out the view of all that lay beyond. deep shadow lay before its feet. sam sniffed the air.
`ugh! that smell!' he said. `it's getting stronger and stronger.'
presently they were under the shadow, and there in the midst of it they saw the opening of a cave. `this is the way in,' said gollum softly. `this is the entrance to the tunnel.' he did not speak its name: torech ungol, shelob's lair. out of it came a stench, not the sickly odour of decay in the meads of morgul, but a foul reek, as if filth unnameable were piled and hoarded in the dark within.
`is this the only w

ay, sméagol? ' said frodo.
'yes, yes,' he answered. 'yes, we must go this way now.'
'd'you mean to say you've been through this hole?' said sam. `phew! but perhaps you don't mind bad smells.'
gollum's eyes glinted. `he doesn't know what we minds, does he precious? no, he doesn't. but sméagol can bear things. yes. he's been through. o yes, right through. it's the only way.'
`and what makes the smell, i wonder,' said sam. `it's like - well, i wouldn't like to say. some beastly hole of the orcs, i'll warrant, with a hundred years of their filth in it.'
'well,' said frodo, 'orcs or no, if it's the only way, we must take it.'
drawing a deep breath they passed inside. in a few steps they were in utter and impenetrable dark. not since the lightless passages of moria had frodo or sam known such darkness, and if possible here it was deeper and denser. there, there were airs moving, and echoes, and a sense of space. he

but for a while they could still feel, and indeed the senses of their feet and fingers at first seemed sharpened almost painfully. the walls felt, to their surprise, smooth, and the floor, save for a step now and again, was straight and even, going ever up at the same stiff slope. the tunnel was high and wide, so wide that, though the hobbits walked abreast, only touching the side-walls with their outstretched hands, they were separated, cut off alone in the darkness.
gollum had gone in first and seemed to be only a few steps ahead. while they were still able to give heed to such things, they could hear his breath hissing and gasping just in front of them. but after a time their senses became duller, both touch and hearing seemed to grow numb, and they kept

before they had gone very far, perhaps, but time and distance soon passed out of his reckoning, sam on the right, feeling the wall, was aware that there was an opening at the side: for a moment he caught a faint breath of some air less heavy, and then they passed it by.
'there's more than one passage here,' he whispered with an effort: it seemed hard to make his breath give any sound. `it's as orc-like a place as ever there could be! '
after that, first he on the right, and then frodo on the left, passed three or four such openings, some wider, some smaller; but there was as yet no doubt of t

 in the blind dark to sense some resistance thicker than the foul air. as they thrust forward they felt things brush against their heads, or against their hands, long tentacles, or hanging growths perhaps: they could not tell what they were. and still the stench grew. it grew, until almost it seemed to them that smell was the only clear sense left to them. and that was for their torment. one hour, two hours, three hours: how many had they passed in this lightless hole? hours-days, weeks rather. sam left the tunnel-side and shrank towards frodo, and their hands met and clasped. and so together they still went on.
at length frodo, groping along the left-hand wall, came suddenly to a void. almost he fell sideways into the emptiness. here was some opening in the rock far wider than any they had yet passed; and out of it came a reek so foul, and a sense of lurking malice so intense, that frodo reeled. and at that moment sam too lurched and fell forwards.
fighting off both the sickness and the

fear, frodo gripped sam's hand. `up! ' he said in a hoarse breath without voice. 'it all comes from here, the stench and the peril. now for it! quick! '
calling up his remaining strength and resolution, he dragged sam to his feet, and forced his own limbs to move. sam stumbled beside him. one step, two steps, three steps-at last six steps. maybe they had passed the dreadful unseen opening, but whether that was so or not, suddenly it was easier to move, as if some hostile will for the moment had released them. they struggled on, still hand in hand.
but almost at once they came to a new difficulty. the tunnel forked, or so it seemed, and in the dark they could not tell which was the wider way, or which kept nearer to the straight. which should they take, the l

`which way has gollum gone? ' panted sam. 'and why didn't he wait? '
`sméagol! ' said frodo, trying to call. 'sméagol! ' but his voice croaked, and the name fell dead almost as it left his lips. there was no answer, not an echo, not even a tremor of the air.
`he's really gone this time, i fancy,' muttered sam. `i guess this is just exactly where he meant to bring us. gollum! if ever i lay hands on you again, you'll be sorry for it.'
presently, groping and fumbling in the dark, they found that the opening on the left was blocked: either it was a blind, or else some great stone had fallen in the passage. 'this can't be the way,' frodo whispered. 'right or wrong, we must take the other.'
'and quick! ' sam panted. 'there's something worse than gollum about. i can feel something looking at us.'

not gone more than a few yards when from behind them came a sound, startling and horrible in the heavy padded silence: a gurgling, bubbling noise, and a long venomous hiss. they wheeled round, but nothing could be seen. still as stones they stood, staring, waiting for they did not know what.
`it's a trap!' said sam, and he laid his hand upon the hilt of his sword; and as he did so, he thought of the darkness of the barrow whence it came. 'i wish old tom was near us now!' he thought. then as he stood, darkness about him and a blackness of despair and anger in his heart. it seemed to him that he saw a light: a light in his mind, almost unbearably bright at first, as a sun-ray to the eyes of one long hidden in a windowless pit. then the light became colour: green, gold, silver, white. far off, as in a little

the bubbling hiss drew nearer, and there was a creaking as of some great jointed thing that moved with slow purpose in the dark. a reek came on before it. 'master, master!' cried sam, and the life and urgency came back into his voice. 'the lady's gift! the star-glass! a light to you in dark places, she said it was to be. the star-glass!'
`the star-glass?' muttered frodo, as one answering out of sleep, hardly comprehending. `why yes! why had i forgotten it? a light when all other lights go out! and now indeed light alone can help us.'
slowly his hand went to his bosom, and slowly he held aloft the phial of galadriel. for a moment it glimmered, faint as a rising star struggli

was aware of eyes growing visible, two great clusters of many-windowed eyes - the coming menace was unmasked at last. the radiance of the star-glass was broken and thrown back from their thousand facets, but behind the glitter a pale deadly fire began steadily to glow within, a flame kindled in some deep pit of evil thought. monstrous and abominable eyes they were, bestial and yet filled with purpose and with hideous delight, gloating over their prey trapped beyond all hope of escape.
frodo and sam, horror-stricken, began slowly to back away, their own gaze held by the dreadful stare of those baleful eyes; but as they backed so the eyes advanced. frodo's hand wavered, and slowly the phial drooped. then suddenly, released from the holding spell to run a little while in vain panic for the amusement of the eyes, they both turned and fled together; but even as they ran frodo looked back and saw with terror that at once the eyes came leaping up behind. the stench of death was like a cloud abou

eyes.
they wavered. doubt came into them as the light approached. one by one they dimmed, and slowly they drew back. no brightness so deadly had ever afflicted them before. from sun and moon and star they had been safe underground, but now a star had descended into the very earth. still it approached, and the eyes began to quail. one by one they all went dark; they turned away, and a great bulk, beyond the light's reach, heaved its huge shadow in between. they were gone.
'master, master!' cried sam. he was close behind, his own sword drawn and ready. 'stars and glory! but the elves would make a song of that, if ever they heard of it! and may i live to tell them and hear them sing. but don't go on, master. don't go down to that den! now's our only chance. now let's get out of this foul hole!'
and so back they turned once more, first walking and then running; for as they went the floor of the tunnel rose steeply, and with every stride they climbed higher above the stenches of the unseen lai

holding aloft the phial frodo looked and before him he saw a greyness which the radiance of the star-glass did not pierce and did not illuminate, as if it were a shadow that being cast by no light, no light could dissipate. across the width and height of the tunnel a vast web was spun, orderly as the web of some huge spider, but denser-woven and far greater, and each thread was as thick as rope.
sam laughed grimly. `cobwebs! ' he said. `is that all? cobwebs! but what a spider! have at 'em, down with 'em! '
in a fury he hewed at them with his sword, but the thread that he struck did not break. it gave a little and then sprang back like a plucked bowstring, turning the blade and tossing up both sword and arm. three times sam struck with all his force, and at last one single cord of all the countless cords snapped and twisted, curling and whipping through the air. one end of it lashed sam's h

and, and he cried out in pain, starting back and drawing his hand across his mouth.
`it will take days to clear the road like this,' he said. `what's to be done? have those eyes come back? '
`no, not to be seen,' said frodo. `but i still feel that they are looking at me, or thinking about me: making some other plan, perhaps. if this light were lowered, or if it failed, they would quickly come again.'
`trapped in the end! ' said sam bitterly, his anger rising again above weariness and despair. `gnats in a net. may the curse of faramir bite that gollum and bite him quick! '
'that would not help us now,' said frodo. `come! let us see what sting can do. it is an elven-blade. there were webs of horror in the dark ravines of beleriand where it was forged. but you must be the guard and hold back the eyes. here, take the star-glass. do not be afraid. hold it up and watch!'
then frodo stepped up to the great grey net, and hewed it

 night. the great smokes had risen and grown thinner, and the last hours of a sombre day were passing; the red glare of mordor had died away in sullen gloom. yet it seemed to frodo that he looked upon a morning of sudden hope. almost he had reached the summit of the wall. only a little higher now. the cleft, cirith ungol, was before him, a dim notch in the black ridge, and the horns of rock darkling in the sky on either side. a short race, a sprinter's course and he would be through!
`the pass, sam! ' he cried, not heeding the shrillness of his voice, that released from the choking airs of the tunnel rang out now high and wild. 'the pass! run, run, and we'll be through-through before any one can stop us! '
sam came up behind as fast as he could urge his legs; but glad as he was to be free, he was uneasy, and as he ran, he kept on glancing back at the dark arch of the tunnel, fearing to see eyes, or some shape beyond his imagining, spring out in pursuit. too little did he or his master kno

so they both lived, delighting in their own devices, and feared no assault, nor wrath, nor any end of their wickedness. never yet had any fly escaped from shelob's webs, and the greater now was her rage and hunger.
but nothing of this evil which they had stirred up against them did poor sam know, except that a fear was growing on him, a menace which he could not see; and such a weight did it become that it was a burden to him to run, and his feet seemed leaden.
dread was round him, and enemies before him in the pass, and his master was in a fey mood running heedlessly to meet them. turning his eyes away from the shadow behind and the deep gloom beneath the cliff upon his left, he looked ahead, and he saw two things that increased his dismay. he saw that the sword which frodo still

hardly had sam hidden the light of the star-glass when she came. a little way ahead and to his left he saw suddenly, issuing from a black hole of shadow under the cliff, the most loathly shape that he had ever beheld, horrible beyond the horror of an evil dream. most like a spider she was, but huger than the great hunting beasts, and more terrible than they because of the evil purpose in her remorseless eyes. those same eyes that he had thought daunted and defeated, there they were lit with a fell light again

as soon as she had squeezed her soft squelching body and its folded limbs out of the upper exit from her lair, she moved with a horrible speed, now running on her creaking legs, now making a sudden bound. she was between sam and his master. either she did not see sam, or she avoided him for the moment as the bearer of the light` and fixed all her intent upon one prey, upon frodo, bereft of his phial, running heedless up the path, unaware yet of his peril. swiftly he ran, but shelob was swifter; in a few leaps she would have him.
sam gasped and gathered all his remaining breath to shout. 'look out behind! ' he yelled. 'look out master! i'm' - but suddenly his cry was stifled.

`got him! ' hissed gollum in his ear. `at last, my precious, we've got him, yes, the nassty hobbit. we takes this one. she'll get the other. o yes, shelob will get him, not sméagol: he promised; he won't hurt master at all. but he's got you, you nassty filthy little sneak!' he spat on sam's neck.
fury at the treachery, and desperation at the delay when his master was in deadly peril, gave to sam a sudden violence and strength that was far beyond anything that gollum had expected from this slow stupid hobbit, as he thought him. not gollum himself could have twisted more quickly or more fiercely. his hold on sam's mouth slipped, and sam ducked and lunged forward again, trying to tear away from the grip on his neck. his sword was still in his hand, and on his left arm, hanging by i

then sam played his last trick. with all his strength he pulled away and got his feet firmly planted; then suddenly he drove his legs against the ground and with his whole force hurled himself backwards.
not expecting even this simple trick from sam, gollum fell over with sam on top, and he received the weight of the sturdy hobbit in his stomach. a sharp hiss came out of him, and for a second his hand upon sam's throat loosened; but his fingers still gripped the sword-hand. sam tore himself forward and

with a squeal gollum let go. then sam waded in; not waiting to change the staff from left to right he dealt another savage blow. quick as a snake gollum slithered aside. and the stroke aimed at his head fell across his back. the staff cracked and broke. that was enough for him. grabbing from behind was an old game of his, and seldom had he failed in it. but this time, misled by spite, he had made the mistake of speaking and gloating before he had both hands on his victim's neck. everything had gone wrong with his beautiful plan, si

nce that horrible light had so unexpectedly appeared in the darkness. and now he was face to face with a furious enemy, little less than his own size. this fight was not for him. sam swept up his sword from the ground and raised it. gollum squealed, and springing aside on to all fours, he jumped away in one big bound like a frog. before sam could reach him, he was off, running with amazing speed back towards the tunnel.
sword in hand sam went after him. for the moment he had forgotten everything else but the red fury in his brain and the desire to kill gollum. but before he could overtake him, gollum was gone. then as the dark hole stood before him and the stench came out to meet him, like a clap of thunder the thought of frodo and the monster smote upon sam's mind. he spun round, and rushed wildly up the path, calling and calling his master's name. he was too late. so far gollum's plot had succeeded.

frodo was lying face upward on the ground and the monster was bending over him, so intent upon her victim that she took no heed of sam and his cries, until he was close at hand. as he rushed up he saw that frodo was already bound in cords, wound about him from ankle to shoulder, and the monster with her great forelegs was beginning half to lift, half to drag his body away.
on the near side of him lay, gleaming on the ground, his elven-blade, where it had fallen useless from his grasp. sam did not wait to wonder what was to be done, or whether he was brave, or loyal, or filled with rage. he sprang forward with a yell, and seize

disturbed as if out of some gloating dream by his small yell she turned slowly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him. but almost before she was aware that a fury was upon her greater than any she had known in countless years, the shining sword bit upon her foot and shore away the claw. sam sprang in, inside the arches of her legs, and with a quick upthrust of his other hand stabbed at the clustered eyes upon her lowered head. one great eye went dark.
now the miserable creature was right under her, for the moment out of the reach of her sting and of her claws. her vast belly was above him with its putrid light, and the stench of it almost smote him down. still his fury held for one more blow, and before she could sink upon him, smothering him and all his little impudence of courag

but shelob was not as dragons are, no softer spot had she save only her eyes. knobbed and pitted with corruption was her age-old hide, but ever thickened from within with layer on layer of evil growth. the blade scored it with a dreadful gash, but those hideous folds could not be pierced by any strength of men, not though elf or dwarf should forge the steel or the hand of beren or of túrin wield it. she yielded to the stroke, and then heaved up the great bag of her belly high above sam's head. poison frothed and bubbled from the wound. now splaying her legs she drove her huge bulk down on him again. too soon. for sam still stood upon his feet, and dropping his own sword, with both hands he held the elven-blade point upwards, fending off that ghastly roof; and so shelob, with the driving force of her own cruel will, with strength greater than any warrior's hand, thrust herself upon a bitter spike. deep, deep it pricked, as sam was crushed slowly to the ground.

had shelob ever known, or dreamed of knowing, in all her long world of wickedness. not the doughtiest soldier of old gondor, nor the most savage orc entrapped, had ever thus endured her, or set blade to her beloved flesh. a shudder went through her. heaving up again, wrenching away from the pain, she bent her writhing limbs beneath her and sprang backwards in a convulsive leap.
sam had fallen to his knees by frodo's head, his senses reeling in the foul stench, his two hands still gripping the hilt of the sword. through the mist before his eyes he was aware dimly of frodo's face and stubbornly he fought to master himself and to drag himself out of the swoon that was upon him. slowly he raised his head and saw her, only a few paces away, eyeing him, her beak drabbling a spittle of venom, and a green ooze trickling from below her wounded eye. there she crouched, her shudderi

even as sam himself crouched, looking at her, seeing his death in her eyes, a thought came to him, as if some remote voice had spoken. and he fumbled in his breast with his left hand, and found what he sought: cold and hard and solid it seemed to his touch in a phantom world of horror, the phial of galadriel.
'galadriel! ' he said faintly, and then he heard voices far off but clear: the crying of the elves as they walked under the stars in the beloved shadows of the shire, and the music of the elves as it

`now come, you filth!' he cried. `you've hurt my master, you brute, and you'll pay for it. we're going on; but we'll settle with you first. come on, and taste it again!'
as if his indomitable spirit had set its potency in motion, the glass blazed suddenly like a white torch in his hand. it flamed like a star that leaping from the firmament sears the dark air with intolerable light. no such terror out of heaven had ever burned in shelob's face before. the be

sam came on. he was reeling like a drunken man, but he came on. and shelob cowed at last, shrunken in defeat, jerked and quivered as she tried to hasten from him. she reached the hole, and squeezing down, leaving a trail of green-yellow slime, she slipped in, even as sam hewed a last stroke at her dragging legs. then he fell to the ground.

sam was left alone. wearily, as the evening of the nameless land fell upon the place of battle, he crawled back to his master.
'master, dear master,' he said, but frodo did not speak. as he had run forward, eager, rejoicing to be free, shelob with hideous speed had come behind and with one swift stroke had stung him in the neck. he lay now pale, and heard no voice. and did not move.

`frodo, mr. frodo! ' he called. 'don't leave me here alone! it's your sam calling. don't go where i can't follow! wake up, mr. frodo! o wake up, frodo, me dear, me dear. wake up!'
then anger surged over hint, and he ran about his master's body in a rage, stabbing the air, and smiting the stones, and shouting challenges. presently he came back, and bending looked at frodo's face, pale beneath him in the dusk. and suddenly he saw that he was in the picture that was revealed to him in the mirror of galadriel in lórien: frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep under a g

reat dark cliff. or fast asleep he had thought then. `he's dead! ' he said. 'not asleep, dead! ' and as he said it, as if the words had set the venom to its work again. it seemed to him that the hue of the face grew livid green.
and then black despair came down on him, and sam bowed to the ground, and drew his grey hood over his head, and night came into his heart, and he knew no more.
when at last the blackness passed, sam looked up and shadows were about him; but for how many minutes or hours the world had gone dragging on he could not tell. he was still in the same place, and still his master lay beside him dead. the mountains had not crumbled nor the earth fallen into ruin.
'what shall i do, what shall i do? ' he said. `did i come all this way with him for nothing? ' and then he remembered his own voice speaking words that at the time he did not understand himself, at the beginning of their journey: i have som

'but you haven't put yourself forward; you've been put forward. and as for not being the right and proper person, why, mr. frodo wasn't as you might say, nor mr. bilbo. they didn't choose themselves.'
`ah well, i must make up my own mind. i will make it up. but i'll be sure to go wrong: that'd be sam gamgee all over.

he stooped. very gently he undid the clasp at the neck and slipped his hand inside frodo's tunic; then with his other hand raising the head, he kissed the cold forehead, and softly drew the chain over it. and then the head lay quietly back again in rest. no change came over the still face, and by that more than by all other tokens sam was convinced at last that frodo had died and laid aside the quest.
`good-bye, master, my dear! ' he murmured. 'forgive your sam. he'll come back to this spot when the job's done - if he manages it. and then he'll not leave you again. rest you quiet till i come; and may no foul creature come anigh you! and if the lady could hear me and give me one wish, i would wish to come back and find you again. good-bye!

became less, or new strength grew in him, he raised his head, and then with a great effort got to his feet and found that he could walk and bear his burden. and for a moment he lifted up the phial and looked down at his master, and the light burned gently now with the soft radiance of the evening-star in summer, and in that light frodo's face was fair of hue again, pale but beautiful with an elvish beauty, as of one who has long passed the shadows. and with the bitter comfort of that last sight sam turned and hid the light and stumbled on into the growing dark.
he had not far to go. the tunnel was some way behind; the cleft a couple of hundred yards ahead, or less. the path was visible in the dusk` a deep rut worn in ages of passage, running now gently up in a long trough with cliffs on either side. the trough narrowed rapidly. soon sam came to a long flight of broad shallow steps. now the orc-tower was right above him, frowning black, and in it the red eye glowed. now he was hidden in th

ing down had sighted one another, and both parties were now hurrying and shouting. he heard them both clearly, and he understood what they said. perhaps the ring gave understanding of tongues, or simply understanding, especially of the servants of sauron its maker, so that if he gave heed, he understood and translated the thought to himself. certainly the ring had grown greatly in power as it approached the places of its forging; but one thing it did not confer, and that was courage. at present sam still thought only of hiding, of lying low till all was quiet again; and he listened anxiously. he could not tell how near the voices were, the words seemed almost in his ears.
'hola! gorbag! what are you doing up here? had enough of war already? '
'orders, you lubber. and what are you doing, shagrat? tired of lurking up there? thinking of coming down to fight? '
'orders to you. i'm in command of this pass. so speak civil. what's your report? '
'nothing.'
`hai! hai! yoi!' a yell broke into the

exchanges of the leaders. the orcs lower down had suddenly seen something. they began to run. so did the others.
`hai! hola! here's something! lying right in the road. a spy, a spy! ' there was a hoot of snarling horns and a babel of baying voices.
with a dreadful stroke sam was wakened from his cowering mood. they had seen his master. what would they do? he had heard tales of the orcs to make the blood run cold. it could not be borne. he sprang up. he flung the quest and all his decisions away, and fear and doubt with them. he knew now where his place was and had been: at his master's side, though what he could do there was not clear. back he ran down the steps, down the path towards frodo.
`how many are there?' he thought. `thirty or forty from the tower at least

there they were again! a good way ahead still. a cluster of figures round something lying on the ground; a few seemed to be darting this way and that, bent like dogs on a trail. he tried to make a spurt.
'come on, sam! ' he said, `or you'll be too late again.' he loosened the sword in its sheath. in a minute he would draw it, and then-
there was a wild clamour, hooting and laughing, as something was lifted from the ground. 'ya hoi! ya harri hoi! up! up! '
then a voice shouted: `now off! the quick way. back to the undergate! she'll not trouble us tonight by all the signs.' the whole band of orc-figures began to move. four in the middle were carrying a body high on their shoulders. `ya hoi! '
they had taken fr

odo's body. they were off. he could not catch them up. still he laboured on. the orcs reached the tunnel and were passing in. those with the burden went first, and behind them there was a good deal of struggling and jostling. sam came on. he drew the sword, a flicker of blue in his wavering hand, but they did not see it. even as he came panting up, the last of them vanished into the black hole.
for a moment he stood, gasping, clutching his breast. then he drew his sleeve across his face, wiping away the grime, and sweat, and tears. 'curse the filth! ' he said, and sprang after them into the darkness.
it no longer seemed very dark to him in the tunnel, rather it was as if he had stepped out of a thin mist into a heavier

 shelob had taken up her abode in ages past. they did not know: but many byways they had themselves delved about in on either side, so as to escape the lair in their goings to and fro on the business of their masters. tonight they did not intend to go far down. but were hastening to find a side-passage that led back to their watch-tower on the cliff. must of them were gleeful, delighted with what they had found and seen, and as they ran they gabbled and yammered after the fashion of their kind. sam heard the noise of their harsh voices, flat and hard in the dead air, and he could distinguish two voices from among all the rest: they were louder, and nearer to him. the captains of the two parties seemed to be bringing up the rear, debating as they went.
'can't you stop your rabble making such a racket, shagrat? ' grunted the one. `we don't want shelob on us.'
`go on, gorbag! yours are making more than half the noise,' said the other. `but let the lads play! no need to worry about shelob for

m laugh. and we've struck a bit of luck at last: got something that lugbúrz wants.'
'lugbúrz wants it, eh? what is it, d'you think? elvish it looked to me, but undersized. what's the danger in a thing like that? '
'don't know till we've had a look.'
'oho! so they haven't told you what to expect? they don't tell us all they know, do they? not by half. but they can make mistakes, even the top ones can.'
`sh, gorbag!' shagrat's voice was lowered, so that even with his strangely sharpened hearing sam could only just catch what was said. 'they may, but they've got eyes and ears everywhere; some among my lot, as like as not. but there's no doubt about it, they're troubled about something. the nazgûl down below are, by your account; and lugbúrz is too. something nearly slipped.'
`nearly, you say! ' said gorbag.
`all right,' said shagrat, `but we'll talk of that later: wait till we get to the under-way. there's a place there where we can talk a bit, while the lads go on.'

am saw the torches disappear. then there was a rumbling noise, and just as he hurried up, a bump. as far as he could guess the orcs had turned and gone into the very opening which frodo and he had tried and found blocked. it was still blocked.
there seemed to be a great stone in the way, but the orcs had got through somehow, for he could hear their voices on the other side. they were still running along, deeper and deeper into the mountain, back towards the tower. sam felt desperate. they were carrying off his master's body for some foul purpose and he could not follow. he thrust and pushed at the block, and he threw himself against it, but it did not yield. then not far inside, or so he thought, he heard the two captains' voices talking again. he stood still listening for a little hoping perhaps to learn something useful. perhaps gorbag, who seemed to belong to minas morgul, would come out, and he could then slip in.
`no, i don't know,' said gorbag's voice.

you use your eyes back there? i tell you i'm not easy in my mind. whatever came up the stairs, did get by. it cut her web and got clean out of the hole. that's something to think about! '
`ah well, but she got him in the end, didn't she? '
`got him? got who? this little fellow? but if he was the only one then she'd have had him off to her larder long before, and there he'd be now. and if lugbúrz wanted him, you'd have to go and get him. nice for you. but there was more than one.'
at this point sam began to listen more attentively and pressed his ear against the stone.
'who cut the cords she'd put round him, shagrat? same one as cut the web. didn't you see that? and who stuck a pin into her ladyship? same one, i reckon. and where is he? where is he, shagrat? '
shagrat made no reply.
`you may well put your thinking cap on, if you've got one. it's no laughing matter. no one, no one has ever stuck a pin in shelob before, as you should know well enough. there's no grief in that; but think-the

re's someone loose hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damned rebel that ever walked since the bad old times, since the great siege. something has slipped.'
`and what is it then? ' growled shagrat.
`by all the signs, captain shagrat, i'd say there's a large warrior loose, elf most likely, with an elf-sword anyway, and an axe as well maybe: and he's loose in your bounds, too, and you've never spotted him. very funny indeed! ' gorbag spat. sam smiled grimly at this description of himself.
'ah well, you always did take a gloomy view.' said shagrat. 'you can read the signs how you like, but there may be other ways to explain them. anyhow. i've got watchers at every point, and i'm going to deal with one thing at a time. when i've had a look at the fellow we have caught, then i'll begin to worry about something else.'
`it's my guess you won't find much in that little fellow,' said gorbag. 'he may have had nothing to do with the real misc

hat difficult,' laughed gorbag. 'he's nothing but carrion now. what lugbúrz will do with such stuff i can't guess. he might as well go in the pot.'
'you fool,' snarled shagrat. 'you've been talking very clever, but there's a lot you don't know, though most other folk do. you'll be for the pot or for shelob, if you don't take care. carrion! is that all you know of her ladyship? when she binds with cords, she's after meat. she doesn't eat dead meat, nor suck cold blood. this fellow isn't dead! '
sam reeled, clutching at the stone. he felt as if the whole dark world was turning upside down. so great was the shock that he almost swooned, but even as he fought to keep a hold on his senses, deep inside him he was aware of the comment: 'you fool, he isn't dead, and your heart knew it. don't trust your head, samwise, it is not the best part of you. the trouble with you is that you never really had any hope. now what is to be done? ' fur the moment nothing, but to prop himself against the unmovin

ing else. i don't suppose he's ever been in lovely lugbúrz, so he may like to know what to expect. this is going to be more funny than i thought. let's go!'
`there's going to be no fun, i tell you,' said shagrat. 'and he's got to be kept safe, or we're all as good as dead.'
`all right! but if i were you, i'd catch the big one that's loose, before you send in any report to lugbúrz. it won't sound too pretty to say you've caught the kitten and let the cat escape.'
the voices began to move away. sam heard the sound of feet receding. he was recovering from his shock, and now a wild fury was on him. `i got it all wrong! ' he cried. `i knew i would. now they've got him, the devils! the filth! never leave your master, never, never: that was my right rule. and i knew it in my heart. may i be forgiven! now i've got to get back to him. somehow, somehow! '
he drew his sword again and beat on the stone with the hilt, but it only gave out a dull sound. the sword, however, blazed so brightly now that

 he could see dimly in its light. to his surprise he noticed that the great block was shaped like a heavy door, and was less than twice his own height. above it was a dark blank space between the top and the low arch of the opening. it was probably only meant to be a stop against the intrusion of shelob, fastened on the inside with some latch or bolt beyond the reach of her cunning. with his remaining strength sam leaped and caught the top, scrambled up, and dropped; and then he ran madly, sword blazing in hand, round a bend and up a winding tunnel.
the news that his master was still alive roused him to a last effort beyond thought of weariness. he could not see anything ahead. for this new passage twisted and turned constantly; but he thought he was catching the two orcs up: their voices were growing nearer again. now they seemed quite close.
`that's what i'm going to do,' said shagrat in angry tones. '

put him right up in the top chamber.'
`what for? ' growled gorbag. `haven't you any lock-ups down below? '
`he's going out of harm's way, i tell you,' answered shagrat. 'see? he's precious. i don't trust all my lads, and none of yours; nor you neither, when you're mad for fun. he's going where i want him, and where you won't come, if you don't keep civil. up to the top, i say. he'll be safe there.'
`will he?' said sam. 'you're forgetting the great big elvish warrior that's loose!' and with that he raced round the last corner, only to find that by some trick of the tunnel, or of the hearing which the ring gave him, he had misjudged the distance.
the two orc-figures were still some way ahead. he could see them now, black and squat against a red glare. the passage ran straight at last, up an incline; and at the end, wide open, were great double doors, leading probably to deep chambers far below the high horn of

 the tower. already the orcs with their burden had passed inside. gorbag and shagrat were drawing near the gate.
sam heard a burst of hoarse singing, blaring of horns and banging of gongs, a hideous clamour. gorbag and shagrat were already on the threshold.
sam yelled and brandished sting, but his little voice was drowned in the tumult. no one heeded him.
the great doors slammed to. boom. the bars of iron fell into place inside. clang. the gate was shut. sam hurled himself against the bolted brazen plates and fell senseless to the ground. he was out in the darkness. frodo was alive but taken by the enemy.
here ends the second part of the history of the war of the ring.

the third part tells of the last defence against the shadow, and the end of the mission of the ring-bearer in the return of the king.
