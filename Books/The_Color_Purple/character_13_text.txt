r and all the children got in the prizefighter car and went to town. clam out on the street looking

try to ruin my game


dear god,


sofia say to me today, i just can't understand it.

what that? i ast.

why we ain't already kill them off.

three years after she beat she out of the wash house, got her color and her weight back, look like her old self, just all time
think bout killing somebody.

too many to kill off, i say. us outnumbered from the start. i speck we knock over one or two, though, here and there,
through the years, i say.

we sit on a piece of old crate out near the edge of miss millie's yard. rusty nails stick out long the bottom and when us
move they creak gainst the wood.

sofia job to watch the children play ball. the little boy throw the ball to the little girl, she try to catch it with her eyes shut.
it roll up under sofia foot.

throw me the ball, say the little boy, with his hands on his hip. throw me the ball.

sofia mutter to herself, half to me. i'm here to watch, not to throw, she say. she don't make a move toward the ball.

don't you hear me talking to you, he sh

where us sit, haul off and kick sofia leg. she swing her foot to one side and he scream.

sure enough, blood come leaking through his shoe.

his little sister come watch him cry. he turn redder and redder. call his mama.

miss millie come running. she scared of sofia. everytime she talk to her it like she expect the worst. she don't stand close
to her either. when she git a few yards from where us sit, she motion for billy to come there.

 just as crazy as you can be.

this the first giggle i heard in three years.


dear god,


sofia would make a dog laugh, talking about those people she work for. they have the nerve to try to make us think
slavery fell through because of us, say sofia. like us didn't have sense enough to handle it. all the time breaking hoe
handles and letting the mules loose in the wheat. but how anything they build can last a day is a wonder to me. they
backward, she say. clumsy, and unlucky.

mayor bought miz millie a new car, cause she said if colored could have cars then one for her was past due. so he

bought her a car, only he refuse to show her how to drive it. every day he come home from town he look at her, look out
the window at her car, say. how you enjoying 'er miz millie. she fly off the sofa in a huff, slam the door going in the
bathroom.

she ain't got no friends.

so one day she say to me, car been sitting out in the yard two months, sofia, do you know how to drive? i guess she
remembered fir

ly bigger than odessa's porch, and just
about as warm in the winter time. i'm at they beck and call all night and all day. they won't let me see my children. they
won't let me see no mens. well, after five years they let me see you once a year. i'm a slave, she say. what would you call
it?

a captive, he say.

sofia go on with her story, only look at him like she glad he hers.

so i say. yes ma'am. i can teach you, if it the same kind of car i learned on.

next thing you know there go me and miz millie all up and down the road. first i drive and she watch, then she start to try
to drive and i watch her. up and down the road. soon as i finish cooking breakfast, putting it on the table, washing dishes
and sweeping the floor— and just before i go git the mail out of the box down by the road— we go give miz millie her
driving lesson.

well, after while she got the hang of it, more or less. then she really git it. then one day when we come home from
riding, she say to me, i'm gonna drive you h

roat.

finally she say, sofia, with a little laugh. this is the south.

yes ma'am, i say.

she clear her throat, laugh some more. look where you sitting, she say.

i'm sitting where i always sit, i say.

that's the problem, she say. have you ever seen a white person and a colored sitting side by side in a car, when one of
'em wasn't showing the other one how to drive it or clean it?

i got out the car, opened the back door and clammed in. she sat down up front. off us traveled down the road, miz millie
hair blowing all out the window.

it's real pretty country out this way, she say, when we hit the marshall county road, coming toward odessa's house.

yes ma'am, i say.

then us pull into the yard and all the children come crowding round the car. nobody told them i was coming, so they
don't know who i is. except the oldest two. they fall on me, and hug me. and then all the little ones start to hug me too. i
don't think they even notice i was sitting in the back of the car. odessa and jack come

out after i was out, so they didn't
see it.


us all stand round kissing and hugging each other, miz millie just watching. finally, she lean out the window and say,
sofia, you only got the rest of the day. i'll be back to pick you up at five o'clock the children was all pulling me into the
house, so sort of over my shoulder i say. yes ma'am, and i thought i heard her drive off.

but fifteen minutes later, marion says. that white lady still out there.

maybe she going to wait to take you back, say jack.

maybe she sick, say odessa. you always say how sickly they is.

i go out to the car, say sofia, an

ngine dead.

don't worry, i say, odessa's husband jack will drive you home. that's his pick-up right there.

oh, she say, i couldn't ride in a pick-up with a strange colored man.

i'll ask odessa to squeeze in too, i say. that would give me a chance to spend a little time with the children, i thought. but
she say. no, i don't know her neither.

so it end up with me and jack driving her back home in the pick-up, then jack driving me to town to git a mechanic, and at
five o'clock i was driving miz millie's car back to her house.

i spent fifteen minutes with my children.

and she been going on for months bout how ungrateful i is.

white folks is a miracle of affliction, say sofia.
