red four shots more
into the inert body, on which they left no visible trace. and each successive shot was
another loud, fateful rap on the door of my undoing.

i was questioned several times immediately after my arrest. but they were all formal
examinations, as to my identity and so forth. at the first of these, which took place at
the police station, nobody seemed to have much interest in the case. however, when
i was brought before the examining magistrate a week later, i noticed that he eyed
me with distinct curiosity. like the others, he began by asking my name, address,
and occupation, the date and place of my birth. then he inquired if i had chosen a
lawyer to defend me. i answered, “no,” i hadn’t thought about it, and asked him if it
was really necessary for me to have one.

“why do you ask that?” he said. i replied that i regarded my case as very simple.
he smiled. “well, it may seem so to you. but we’ve got to abide by the la

i answered that, of recent years, i’d rather lost the habit of noting my feelings, and
hardly knew what to answer. i could truthfully say i’d been quite fond of mother—
but really that didn’t mean much. all normal people, i added as on afterthought, had
more or less desired the death of those they loved, at some time or another.

here the lawyer interrupted me, looking greatly perturbed.
“you  must  promise  me  not  to  say  anything  of  that  sort  at  the  trial,  or  to  the

examining magistrate.”

i promised, to satisfy him, but i explained that my physical condition at any given
moment often influenced my feelings. for instance, on the day i attended mother’s
funeral, i was fagged out and only half awake. so, really, i hardly took stock of what
was  happening.  anyhow,  i  could  assure  him  of  one  thing:  that  i’d  rather  mother
hadn’t died.

the lawyer, however, looked displeased. “that’s not enough,” he said curtly.
after considering for a bit he asked me if he

my  defense,  but,  if  i  might  put  it  so,  spontaneously.  i  could  see  that  i  got  on  his
nerves; he couldn’t make me out, and, naturally enough, this irritated him. once or
twice i had a mind to assure him that i was just like everybody else; quite an ordinary

person. but really that would have served no great purpose, and i let it go—out of
laziness as much as anything else.

later in the day i was taken again to the examining magistrate’s office. it was two
in the afternoon and, this time, the room was flooded with light—there was only a
thin curtain on the window—and extremely hot.

after inviting me to sit down, the magistrate  informed  me  in  a  very  polite  tone
that,  “owing  to  unforeseen  circumstances,”  my  lawyer  was  unable  to  be  present.  i
should be quite entitled, he added, to reserve my answers to his questions until my
lawyer could attend.

to this i replied that i could answer for myself. he
