Count Ugolino - 
                A
traitor condemned to the Second Ring of the Ninth Circle of Hell.
Ugolino gnaws on the head of another damned traitor, Archbishop
Ruggieri. When Ruggieri imprisoned Ugolino and his sons, denying them
food, Ugolino was driven to eat the corpses of his starved sons.
