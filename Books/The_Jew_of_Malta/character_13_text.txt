 pygmalion to contend,
     or painting with apelles, doubtless the end
     must be disgrace:  our actor did not so,--
     he only aim'd to go, but not out-go.
     nor think that this day any prize was play'd; [9]
     here were no bets at all, no wagers laid: [10]
     all the ambition that his mind doth swell,
     is but to hear from you (by me) 'twas well.

     to shun suspicion, therefore, let us part.

     barabas. farewell, my joy, and by my fingers take
     a kiss from him that sends it from his soul.

          enter ferneze, [60] martin del bosco, knights, and officers.

     ferneze. now, captain, tell us whither thou art bound?
     whence is thy ship that anchors in our road?
     and why thou cam'st ashore without our leave?

     martin del bosco. governor of malta, hither am i bound;
     my ship, the flying dragon, is of spain,
     and so am i; del bosco is my name,
     vice-admiral unto the catholic king.

     first knight. 'tis true, my lord; therefore entreat [61] him well.

ns, turks, and afric moors;
     for late upon the coast of corsica,
     because we vail'd not [62] to the turkish [63] fleet,
     their creeping galleys had us in the chase:
     but suddenly the wind began to rise,
     and then we luff'd and tack'd, [64] and fought at ease:
     some have we fir'd, and many have we sunk;
     but one amongst the rest became our prize:
     the captain's slain; the rest remain our slaves,
     of whom we would make sale in malta here.

     ferneze. martin del bosco, i have heard of thee:
     welcome to malta, and to all of us!
     but to admit a sale of these thy turks,
     we may not, nay, we dare not give consent,
     by reason of a tributary league.

     first knight. del bosco, as thou lov'st and honour'st us,
     persuade our governor against the turk:
     this truce we have is but in hope of gold,
     and with that sum he craves might we wage war.

     martin del bosco. will knights of malta be in league with turks,
     and buy it basely t

oo for sums of gold?
     my lord, remember that, to europe's shame,
     the christian isle of rhodes, from whence you came,
     was lately lost, and you were stated [65] here
     to be at deadly enmity with turks.

     ferneze. captain, we know it; but our force is small.

     martin del bosco. what is the sum that calymath requires?

     ferneze. a hundred thousand crowns.

     martin del bosco. my lord and king hath title to this isle,
     and he means quickly to expel you hence;
     therefore be rul'd by me, and keep the gold:
     i'll write unto his majesty for aid,
     and not depart until i see you free.

     ferneze. on this condition shall thy turks be sold.--
     go, officers, and set them straight in show.--
          [exeunt officers.]
     bosco, thou shalt be malta's general;
     we and our warlike knights will follow thee

urks.

     martin del bosco. so shall you imitate those you succeed;
     for, when their hideous force environ'd rhodes,
     small though the number was that kept the town,
     they fought it out, and not a man surviv'd
     to bring the hapless news to christendom.

     ferneze. so will we fight it out:  come, let's away.
     proud daring calymath, instead of gold,
     we'll send thee bullets wrapt in smoke and fire:
     claim tribute where thou wilt, we are resolv'd,--

ithamore, go set it down;
     and come again so soon as thou hast done,
     for i have other business for thee.

     ithamore. here's a drench to poison a whole stable of flanders
     mares:  i'll carry't to the nuns with a powder.

     barabas. and the horse-pestilence to boot:  away!

     ithamore. i am gone:
     pay me my wages, for my work is done.
          [exit with the pot.]

     barabas. i'll pay thee with a vengeance, ithamore!
          [exit.]

          enter ferneze, [116] martin del bosco, knights, and basso.

     ferneze. welcome, great basso: [117]  how fares calymath?
     what wind drives you thus into malta-road?

     basso. the wind that bloweth all the world besides,
     desire of gold.

     ferneze. desire of gold, great sir!
     that's to be gotten in the western inde:
     in malta are no golden minerals.

     basso. to you of malta thus saith calymath:
     the time you took for respite is at hand
     for the performance of your promise pass'd;
     and for the

     --bid him deliver thee a thousand crowns, by the same token
     that the nuns loved rice, that friar barnardine slept in his
     own clothes; any of 'em will do it.

     pilia-borza. let me alone to urge it, now i know the meaning.

     ithamore. the meaning has a meaning.  come, let's in:
     to undo a jew is charity, and not sin.

          enter ferneze, [179] knights, martin del bosco, and officers.

     ferneze. now, gentlemen, betake you to your arms,
     and see that malta be well fortified;
     and it behoves you to be resolute;
     for calymath, having hover'd here so long,
     will win the town, or die before the walls.

     first knight. and die he shall; for we will never yield.

          enter bellamira and pilia-borza.

     bellamira. o, bring us to the governor!

     ferneze. away with her! she is a courtezan.

ferneze, 'twas thy son that murder'd him.

     ferneze. be patient, gentle madam:  it was he;
     he forg'd the daring challenge made them fight.

     katharine. where is the jew? where is that murderer?

     ferneze. in prison, till the law has pass'd on him.

          re-enter first officer.

     first officer. my lord, the courtezan and her man are dead;
     so is the turk and barabas the jew.

     ferneze. dead!

     first officer. dead, my lord, and here they bring his body.

     martin del bosco. this sudden death of his is very strange.

          re-enter officers, carrying barabas as dead.

     ferneze. wonder not at it, sir; the heavens are just;
     their deaths were like their lives; then think not of 'em.--
     since they are dead, let them be buried:
     for the jew's body, throw that o'er the walls,
     to be a prey for vultures and wild beasts.--
     so, now away and fortify the town.

     we'll in this summer-evening feast with him.

     messenger. i shall, my lord.
          [exit.]

     calymath. and now, bold bassoes, let us to our tents,
     and meditate how we may grace us best,
     to solemnize our governor's great feast.

          enter ferneze, [198] knights, and martin del bosco.

     ferneze. in this, my countrymen, be rul'd by me:
     have special care that no man sally forth
     till you shall hear a culverin discharg'd
     by him that bears the linstock, [199] kindled thus;
     then issue out and come to rescue me,
     for happily i shall be in distress,
     or you released of this servitude.

     first knight. rather than thus to live as turkish thralls,
     what will we not adventure?

     ferneze. on, then; be gone.

     calymath. how now! what means this?
