“okay,” i say. so i keep holding on, but i can’t help feeling 
strange about the way cinna has linked us together. it’s not 
really fair to present us as a team and then lock us into the 
arena to kill each other. 
the twelve chariots fill the loop of the city circle. on the 
buildings that surround the circle, every window is packed 
with the most prestigious citizens of the capitol. our horses 
pull our chariot right up to president snow’s mansion, and we 
come to a halt. the music ends with a flourish. 
the president, a small, thin man with paper-white hair, 
gives the official welcome from a balcony above us. it is tradi-
tional to cut away to the faces of the tributes during the 
speech. but i can see on the screen that we are getting way 
more than our share of airtime. the darker it becomes, the 
more difficult it is to take your eyes off our flickering. when 
the national anthem plays, they do make an effort to do a

they end not with the announcement of our victory, but 
with me pounding on the glass door of the hovercraft, scream-
ing peeta’s name as they try to revive him. 
in terms of survival, it’s my best moment all night. 
the anthem’s playing yet again and we rise as president 
snow himself takes the stage followed by a little girl carrying 
a cushion that holds the crown. there’s just one crown, 
though, and you can hear the crowd’s confusion — whose 
head will he place it on? — until president snow gives it a 
twist and it separates into two halves. he places the first 
around peeta’s brow with a smile. he’s still smiling when he 
settles the second on my head, but his eyes, just inches from 
mine, are as unforgiving as a snake’s. 
that’s when i know that even though both of us would have 
eaten the berries, i am to blame for having the idea. i’m the in-
stigator. i’m the one to be punished.

tol officials and particularly generous sponsors elbow one 
another out of the way as they try to get their picture with us. 
face after beaming face flashes by, becoming increasingly in-
toxicated as the evening wears on. occasionally, i catch a 
glimpse of haymitch, which is reassuring, or president snow, 
which is terrifying, but i keep laughing and thanking people 
and smiling as my picture is taken. the one thing i never do is 
let go of peeta’s hand. 
the sun is just peeking over the horizon when we straggle 
back to the twelfth floor of the training center. i think now i’ll 
finally get a word alone with peeta, but haymitch sends him 
off with portia to get something fitted for the interview and 
personally escorts me to my door. 
“why can’t i talk to him?” i ask.
