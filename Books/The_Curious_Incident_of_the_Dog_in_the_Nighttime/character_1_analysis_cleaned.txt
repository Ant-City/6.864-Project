[CHARACTER]([CHARACTER])
[CHARACTER]often goes to extremes when demonstrating his emotions,
                occasionally blowing up in anger, and he lacks the confidence to work through his
                problems verbally. when trying to explain himself he stutters and stops and often
                has trouble connecting sentences. like christopher, he has very few friends--rhodri
                is the only one the novel mentions. he also feels emotionally devastated by the way
                his relationship with his wife (christopher's mother) ended two years earlier, and
                because he has no one to help him cope with his emotions, he bottles them up until
                he explodes in anger during stressful situations.
[CHARACTER]lovingly and diligently cares for christopher, yet he
                also struggles with the frustration he feels as a result of not always being able to
                understand christopher's behavior. he carefully prepares all of christopher's meals
                according to christopher's rigid list of likes and dislikes, but he also becomes
                angry with christopher when christopher misunderstands him. notably, he is extremely
                protective of christopher. this impulse to protect christopher and his desire to
                punish christopher's mother for the way she left leads him to lie to christopher
                about mother's leaving. as christopher discovers more and more of the truth about
                his mother, [CHARACTER]can see his relationship with christopher
                deteriorating. [CHARACTER]must work to regain christopher's trust, and the
                novel's final chapters focus on his efforts to reestablish a relationship with
                christopher.
