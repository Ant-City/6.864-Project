 the grass.
     his companion seemed less at ease. he was small, with wide, staring eyes and
a way of raising and turning his head which suggested not so much caution as a
kind of ceaseless, nervous tension. his nose moved continually, and when a
bumblebee flew humming to a thistle bloom behind him, he jumped and spun
round with a start that sent two nearby rabbits scurrying for holes before the
nearest, a buck with black-tipped ears, recognized him and returned to feeding.
     "oh, it's only fiver," said the black-tipped rabbit, "jumping at bluebottles
again. come on, buckthorn, what were you telling me?"
     "fiver?" said the other rabbit. "why's he called that?"
     "five in the litter, you know: he was the last -- and the smallest. you'd wonder
nothing had got him by now. i always say a man couldn't see him and a fox
wouldn't want him. still, i admit he seems to be able to keep out of harm's way."*
     the small rabbit came closer to his companion, lolloping on long hind legs.

 "let's go a bit further, hazel," he said. "you know, there's something queer
about the warren this evening, although i can't tell exactly what it is. shall we go

down to the brook?"
     "all right," answered hazel, "and you can find me a cowslip. if you can't find
one, no one can."
     he led the way down the slope, his shadow stretching behind him on the grass.
they reached the brook and began nibbling and searching close beside the wheel
ruts of the track.
     it was not long before fiver found what they were looking for. cowslips are a
delicacy among rabbits, and as a rule there are very few left by late may in the
neighborhood of even a small warren. this one had not bloomed and its flat
spread of leaves was almost hidden under the long grass. they were just starting
on it when two larger rabbits came running across from the other side of the
nearby cattle wade.
     "cowslip?" said one. "all right -- just leave it to us. come on, hurry up," he
added, as fiver hesitated. "you

heard me, didn't you?"
     "fiver found it, toadflax," said hazel.
     "and we'll eat it," replied toadflax. "cowslips are for owsla* -- don't you know
that? if you don't, we can easily teach you."
     fiver had already turned away. hazel caught him up by the culvert.
     "i'm sick and tired of it," he said. "it's the same all the time. 'these are my
claws, so this is my cowslip.' 'these are my teeth, so this is my burrow.' i'll tell
you, if ever i get into the owsla, i'll treat outskirters with a bit of decency."
     "well, you can at least expect to be in the owsla one day," answered fiver.
"you've got some weight coming and that's more than i shall ever have."
     "you don't suppose i'll leav

e you to look after yourself, do you?" said hazel.
"but to tell you the truth, i sometimes feel like clearing out of this warren
altogether. still, let's forget it now and try to enjoy the evening. i tell you what --
shall we go across the brook? there'll be fewer rabbits and we can have a bit of
peace. unless you feel it isn't safe?" he added.
     the way in which he asked suggested that he did in fact think that fiver was
likely to know better than himself, and it was clear from fiver's reply that this
was accepted between them.
     "no, it's safe enough," he answered. "if i start feeling there's anything
dangerous i'll tell you. but it's not exactly danger that i seem to feel about the
place. it's -- oh, i don't know -- something oppressive, like thunder: i can't tell
what; but it worries me. all the same, i'll come across with you."
     they ran over the culvert. the grass was wet and thick near the stream and
they made their way up the opposite slope, looking for drier

ground. part of the
slope was in shadow, for the sun was sinking ahead of them, and hazel, who
wanted a warm, sunny spot, went on until they were quite near the lane. as they
approached the gate he stopped, staring.
     "fiver, what's that? look!"
     a little way in front of them, the ground had been freshly disturbed. two piles
of earth lay on the grass. heavy posts, reeking of creosote and paint, towered up
as high as the holly trees in the hedge, and the board they carried threw a long
shadow across the top of the field. near one of the posts, a hammer and a few
nails had been left behind.
     the two rabbits went up to the board at a hopping run and crouched in a patch

of nettles on the far side, wrinkling t

heir noses at the smell of a dead cigarette end
somewhere in the grass. suddenly fiver shivered and cowered down.
     "oh, hazel! this is where it comes from! i know now -- something very bad!
some terrible thing -- coming closer and closer."
     he began to whimper with fear.
     "what sort of thing -- what do you mean? i thought you said there was no
danger?"
     "i don't know what it is," answered fiver wretchedly. "there isn't any danger
here, at this moment. but it's coming -- it's coming. oh, hazel, look! the field! it's
covered with blood!"
     "don't be silly, it's only the light of the sunset. fiver, come on, don't talk like
this, you're frightening me!"
     fiver sat trembling and crying among the nettles as hazel tried to reassure him
and to find out what it could be that had suddenly driven him beside himself. if
he was terrified, why did he not run for safety, as any sensible rabbi

t would? but
fiver could not explain and only grew more and more distressed. at last hazel
said,
     "fiver, you can't sit crying here. anyway, it's getting dark. we'd better go back
to the burrow."
     "back to the burrow?" whimpered fiver. "it'll come there -- don't think it
won't! i tell you, the field's full of blood--"
     "now stop it," said hazel firmly. "just let me look after you for a bit. whatever
the trouble is, it's time we got back."
     he ran down the field and over the brook to the cattle wade. here there was a
delay, for fiver -- surrounded on all sides by the quiet summer evening -- became
helpless and almost paralyzed with fear. when at last hazel had got him back to
the ditch, he refused at first to go under

     he did not stay, nor go.

     in the darkness and warmth of the burrow hazel suddenly woke, struggling
and kicking with his back legs. something was attacking him. there was no smell
of ferret or weasel. no instinct told him to run. his head cleared and he realized
that he was alone except for fiver. it was fiver who was clambering over him,
clawing and grabbing like a rabbit trying to climb a wire fence in a panic.
     "fiver! fiver, wake up, you silly fellow! it's hazel. you'll hurt me in a moment.
wake up!"
     he held him down. fiver struggled and woke.
     "oh, hazel! i was dreaming. it was dreadful. you were there. we were sitting
on water, going down a great, deep stream, and then i realized we were on a
board -- like that board in the field -- all white and covered with black li

? don't be silly. they won't come. they'll say you're out of
your wits."
     "then they'll be here when the bad thing comes. you must listen to me, hazel.
believe me, something very bad is close upon us and we ought to go away."
     "well, i suppose we'd better go and see the chief rabbit and you can tell him
about it. or i'll try to. but i don't expect he'll like the idea at all."

     hazel led the way down the slope of the run and up toward the bramble
curtain. he did not want to believe fiver, and he was afraid not to.
     it was a little after ni-frith, or noon. the whole warren were underground,
mostly asleep. hazel and fiver went a short way above ground and then into a
wide, open hole in a sand patch and so down, by various runs, until they were
thirty feet into the wood, among the roots of an oak. here they were stopped by a
large, heavily built rabbit -- one of the owsla. he had a curious, heavy growth of
fur on the crown of his head, which gave him an odd appearance, as thou

were wearing a kind of cap. this had given him his name, thlayli, which means,
literally, "furhead" or, as we might say, "bigwig."
     "hazel?" said bigwig, sniffing at him in the deep twilight among the tree roots.
"it is hazel, isn't it? what are you doing here? and at this time of day?" he
ignored fiver, who was waiting further down the run.
     "we want to see the chief rabbit," said hazel. "it's important, bigwig. can you
help us?"
     "we?" said bigwig. "is he going to see him, too?"
     "yes, he must. do trust me, bigwig. i don't usually come and talk like this, do
i? when did i ever ask to see the chief rabbit before?"
     "well, i'll do it for you, hazel, although i'll probably get my head bitten off. i'll
tell him i know you're a sensible fellow. he ought to know you himself, of cou

but he's getting old. wait here, will you?"
     bigwig went a little way down the run and stopped at the entrance to a large
burrow. after speaking a few words that hazel could not catch, he was evidently
called inside. the two rabbits waited in silence, broken only by the continual
nervous fidgeting of fiver.
     the chief rabbit's name and style was threarah, meaning "lord rowan tree."
for some reason he was always referred to as "the threarah" -- perhaps because
there happened to be only one threar, or rowan, near the warren, from which he
took his name. he had won his position not only by strength in his prime, but
also by level-headedness and a certain self-contained detachment, quite unlike
the impulsive behavior of most rabbits. it was well known that he never let
himself become excited by r

ht of the myxomatosis, ruthlessly
driving out every rabbit who seemed to be sickening. he had resisted all ideas of
mass emigration and enforced complete isolation on the warren, thereby almost
certainly saving it from extinction. it was he, too, who had once dealt with a
particularly troublesome stoat by leading it down among the pheasant coops and
so (at the risk of his own life) onto a keeper's gun. he was now, as bigwig said,
getting old, but his wits were still clear enough. when hazel and fiver were
brought in, he greeted them politely. owsla like toadflax might threaten and
bully. the threarah had no need.
     "ah, walnut. it is walnut, isn't it?"
     "hazel," said hazel.
     "hazel, of course. how very nice of you to come and see me. i knew your
mother well. and your friend--"
     "my brother."
     "your brother," said the threarah, with the faintest suggestion of "don't

e chief rabbit's lettuce was stolen by the owsla from a garden half a mile
away across the fields. outskirters seldom or never saw lettuce. hazel took a
small leaf and nibbled politely. fiver refused, and sat blinking and twitching
miserably.
     "now, how are things with you?" said the chief rabbit. "do tell me how i can
help you."
     "well, sir," said hazel rather hesitantly, "it's because of my brother -- fiver
here. he can often tell when there's anything bad about, and i've found him right
again and again. he knew the flood was coming last autumn and sometimes he
can tell where a wire's been set. and now he says he can sense a bad danger
coming upon the warren."
     "a bad danger. yes, i see. how very upsetting," said the chief rabbit, looking
anything but upset. "now, what sort of danger, i wonder?" he looked at fiver.
     "i don't know," said fiver. "b-but it's bad. it's so b-bad that -- it's ve

concluded miserably.
     the threarah waited politely for a few moments and then he said, "well, now,
and what ought we to do about it, i wonder?"
     "go away," said fiver instantly. "go away. all of us. now. threarah, sir, we
must all go away."
     the threarah waited again. then, in an extremely understanding voice, he
said, "well, i never did! that's rather a tall order, isn't it? what do you think
yourself?"
     "well, sir," said hazel, "my brother doesn't really think about these feelings he
gets. he just has the feelings, if you see what i mean. i'm sure you're the right
person to decide what we ought to do."
     "well, that's very nice of you to say tha

r fellows,
let's just think about this a moment, shall we? it's may, isn't it? everyone's busy
and most of the rabbits are enjoying themselves. no elil for miles, or so they tell
me. no illness, good weather. and you want me to tell the warren that young -- er
-- young -- er -- your brother here has got a hunch and we must all go traipsing
across country to goodness knows where and risk the consequences, eh? what do
you think they'll say? all delighted, eh?"
     "they'd take it from you," said fiver suddenly.
     "that's very nice of you," said the threarah again. "well, perhaps they would,
perhaps they would. but i should have to consider it very carefully indeed. a most
serious step, of course. and then--"
     "but there's no time, threarah, sir," blurted out fiver. "i can feel the danger
like a wire round my neck -- like a wire -- hazel, help!" he squealed and rolled
over in the sand, kicking frantically, as a rabbit does in a snare. hazel held him
down with both forepaws and he grew

quieter.
     "i'm awfully sorry, chief rabbit," said hazel. "he gets like this sometimes.
he'll be all right in a minute."
     "what a shame! what a shame! poor fellow, perhaps he ought to go home and
rest. yes, you'd better take him along now. well, it's really been extremely good of
you to come and see me, walnut. i appreciate it very much indeed. and i shall

think over all you've said most carefully, you can be quite sure of that. bigwig,
just wait a moment, will you?"
     as hazel and fiver made their way dejectedly down the run outside the
threarah's burrow, they could just hear, from inside, the chief rabbit's voice
assuming a rather sharper note, interspersed with an occasional "yes, sir," "no,
sir."
     bigwig, as he had predicted, was getting his head bitten off.

 "but, hazel, you didn't really think the chief rabbit would act on your advice,
did you? what were you expecting?"
     it was evening once more and hazel and fiver were feeding outside the wood
with two friends. blackberry, the rabbit with tipped ears who had been startled by
fiver the night before, had listened carefully to hazel's description of the notice
board, remarking that he had always felt sure that men left these things about to
act as signs or messages of some kind, in the same way that rabbits left marks on
runs and gaps. it was another neighbor, dandelion, who had now brought the
talk back to the threarah and his indifference to fiver's fear.
     "i don't know what i expected," said hazel. "i'd never been near the chief
rabbit before. but i thought, 'well, e

ven if he won't listen, at least no one can say
afterward that we didn't do our best to warn him.'"
     "you're sure, then, that there's really something to be afraid of?"
     "i'm quite certain. i've always known fiver, you see."
     blackberry was about to reply when another rabbit came noisily through the
thick dog's mercury in the wood, blundered down into the brambles and pushed
his way up from the ditch. it was bigwig.
     "hello, bigwig," said hazel. "you're off duty?"
     "off duty" said bigwig, "and likely to remain off duty."
     "how do you mean?"
     "i've left the owsla, that's what i mean."
     "not on our account?"
     "you could say that. the threarah's rather good at making himself unpl

t quiet and thought about keeping on the right side of the
chief, but i'm afraid i'm not much good at that. i told him that the owsla's
privileges didn't mean all that much to me in any case and that a strong rabbit
could always do just as well by leaving the warren. he told me not to be impulsive
and think it over, but i shan't stay. lettuce-stealing isn't my idea of a jolly life, nor
sentry duty in the burrow. i'm in a fine temper, i can tell you."
     "no one will steal lettuces soon," said fiver quietly.

     "oh, that's you, fiver, is it?" said bigwig, noticing him for the first time. "good,
i was coming to look for you. i've been thinking about what you said to the chief
rabbit. tell me, is it a sort of tremendous hoax to make yourself important, or is
it true?"
     "it is true," said fiver. "i wish it weren't."
     "then you'll be leaving the warren?"
     they were all startled by the bluntness with which bigwig went to the point.
dandelion muttered, "leave the warren, frithrah

!" while blackberry twitched his
ears and looked very intently, first at bigwig and then at hazel.
     it was hazel who replied. "fiver and i will be leaving the warren tonight," he
said deliberately. "i don't know exactly where we shall go, but we'll take anyone
who's ready to come with us."
     "right," said bigwig, "then you can take me."
     the last thing hazel had expected was the immediate support of a member of
the owsla. it crossed his mind that although bigwig would certainly be a useful
rabbit in a tight corner, he would also be a difficult one to get on with. he
certainly would not want to do what he was told -- o
 
 ___________________________
 
r even asked -- by an
outskirter. "i don't care if he is in the owsla," thought hazel. "if we get away from
the warren, i'm not going to let bigwig run everything, or why bother to go?" but
he answered only, "good. we shall be glad to have you."
     he looked round at the other rabbits, who were all staring either at bigwig or
at himself. it was blackberry who spoke next.
     "i think i'll come," he said. "i don't quite know whether it's you who've
persuaded me, fiver. but anyway, there are too many bucks in this warren, and
it's pretty poor fun for any rabbit that's not in the owsla. the funny thing is that
you feel terrified to stay and i feel terrified to go. foxes here, weasels there, fiver
in the middle, begone dull care!"
     he pulled out a burnet leaf and ate it slowly, concealing his fear as best he
could; for all his instincts were warning him of the dangers in the unknown
country beyond the warren.
     "if we believe fiver," said hazel, "it mean
 
 ___________________________
 
s that we think no rabbits at all ought
to stay here. so between now and the time when we go, we ought to persuade as
many as we can to join us."
     "i think there are one or two in the owsla who might be worth sounding," said
bigwig. "if i can talk them over, they'll be with me when i join you tonight. but
they won't come because of fiver. they'll be juniors, discontented fellows like me.
you need to have heard fiver yourself to be convinced by him. he's convinced
me. it's obvious that he's been sent some kind of message, and i believe in these
things. i can't think why he didn't convince the threarah."
     "because the threarah doesn't like anything he hasn't thought of for himself,"
answered hazel. "but we can't bother with him any more now. we've got to try to
collect some more rabbits and meet again here, fu inlé. and we'll start fu inlé,
too: we can't wait longer. the danger's coming closer all the

seeing this has seen at work the current that flows (among creatures who think of
themselves primarily as part of a group and only secondarily, if at all, as

thought or will: has seen at work the angel which drove the first crusade into
antioch and drives the lemmings into the sea.
     it was actually about an hour after moonrise and a good while before midnight
when hazel and fiver once more came out of their burrow behind the brambles
and slipped quietly along the bottom of the ditch. with them was a third rabbit,
hlao -- pipkin -- a friend of fiver. (hlao means any small concavity in the grass
where moisture may collect -- e.g., the dimple formed by a dandelion or thistle
cup.) he too was small, and inclined to be timid, and hazel and fiver had spent
the greater part of their last evening in the warren in persuading him to join
them. pipkin had agreed rather hesitantly.

off worst
in some scuffle over a doe and taken it hard. well, with him and bigwig, at least
we shan't be too badly off if we run into any fighting."
     he did not recognize the other two rabbits and when blackberry told him their
names -- speedwell and acorn -- he was none the wiser. but this was not
surprising, for they were typical outskirters -- thin-looking six-monthers, with the
strained, wary look of those who are only too well used to the thin end of the
stick. they looked curiously at fiver. from what blackberry had told them, they
had been almost expecting to find fiver foretelling doom in a poetic torrent.
instead, he seemed more calm and normal than the rest. the certainty of going
had lifted a weight from fiver.
     more time went slowly by. blackberry scrambled up into the fern and then
returned to the top of the bank, fidgeting nervously and half inclined to bolt at
nothing. hazel and fiver remained in the ditch, nibbling halfheartedly at the dark
grass. at last hazel heard

eaking. this was

silver, a nephew of the threarah, who was serving his first month in the owsla.
     hazel could not help feeling relieved that bigwig had brought only silver -- a
quiet, straightforward fellow who had not yet really found his feet among the
veterans. when bigwig had spoken earlier of sounding out the owsla, hazel had
been in two minds. it was only too likely that they would encounter dangers
beyond the warren and that they would stand in need of some good fighters.
again, if fiver was right and the whole warren was in imminent peril, then of
course they ought to welcome any rabbit who was ready to join them. on the
other hand, there seemed no point in taking particular pains to get hold of rabbits
who were going to behave like toadflax.
     "wherever we settle down in the end," thought hazel, "i'm determined to see
that pipkin and fiver aren't sat on and cuffed around until they're ready to run
any risk just to get away. but is bigwig going to see it like that?"
     "y

 silver seemed about to speak when suddenly there was a pattering in the
undergrowth above and three more rabbits came over the bank from the wood.
their movement was direct and purposeful, quite unlike the earlier, haphazard
approach of those who were now gathered in the ditch. the largest of the three
newcomers was in front and the other two followed him, as though under orders.
hazel, sensing at once that they had nothing in common with himself and his
companions, started and sat up tensely. fiver muttered in his ear, "oh, hazel,
they've come to--" but broke off short. bigwig turned toward them and stared, his
nose working rapidly. the three came straight up to him.
     "thlayli?" said the leader.
     "you know me perfectly well," replied bigwig, "and i know you, holly. what do
you want?"
     "you're under arrest."
     "under arrest? what do you mean? what for?"
     "spreading dissension and inciting to mutiny. silver, you're under arrest too,
for failing to report to toadflax this

know that, don't you?"
     "go," repeated hazel, "or you will be killed."
     "it is you who will be killed," replied holly. without another word he, too,
went back up the bank and vanished into the wood.
     dandelion was bleeding from the shoulder. he licked the wound for a few
moments and then turned to hazel.
     "they won't be long coming back, you know, hazel," he said. "they've gone to
turn out the owsla, and then we'll be for it right enough."
     "we ought to go at once," said fiver.
     "yes, the time's come now, all right," replied hazel. "come on, down to the
stream. then we'll follow the bank -- that'll help us to keep together."
     "if you'll take my advice--" began bigwig.
     "if we stay here any longer i shan't be able to," answered hazel.
     with fiver beside him, he led the way out of the ditch and down the slope. in
less than a minute the little band of rabbits had disappeared into the dim,
moonlit night.

ell prove safer than
wandering about the fields in one direction and another, with the risk of finding
themselves, in the end, back at the warren. he decided to go straight into the
wood without consulting bigwig, and to trust that the rest would follow.
     "if we don't run into any trouble and the brook takes us through the wood," he
thought, "we really shall be clear of the warren and then we can look for
somewhere to rest for a bit. most of them still seem to be more or less all right,
but fiver and pipkin will have had as much as they can stand before long."
     from the moment he entered it, the wood seemed full of noises. there was a

smell of damp leaves and moss, and everywhere the splash of water went
whispering about. just inside, the brook made a little fall into a pool, and the
sound, enclosed among the trees, echoed as though in a cave. roosting birds
rustled overhead; the night breeze stirred the leaves; here and there a dead twig
fell. and there were more sinister, uniden

     "hazel, we'll have to stop here," said bigwig, coming up between the panting,
crouching bodies of the others. "i know it's not a good place, but fiver and this
other half-sized fellow you've got here -- they're pretty well all in. they won't be
able to go on if we don't rest."
     the truth was that every one of them was tired. many rabbits spend all their
lives in the same place and never run more than a hundred yards at a stretch.
even though they may live and sleep above ground for months at a time, they
prefer not to be out of distance of some sort of refuge that will serve for a hole.

since entering the wood they had been in severe anxiety. several were almost
tharn -- that is, in that state of staring, glazed paralysis that comes over terrified
or exhausted rabbits, so that they sit and watch their enemies -- weasels or
humans -- approach to take their lives. pipkin sat trembling under a fern, his ears
drooping on either side of his head. he held one paw forward in an awkward,
unnatural way and kept licking it miserably. fiver was little better off. he still
looked cheerful, but very weary. hazel realized that until they were rested they
would all be safer where they were than stumbling along in the open with no
strength left to run from an enemy. but if they lay brooding, unable to feed or go
underground, all their troubles would come crowding into their hearts, their fears
would mount and they might very likely scatter, or even try to return to the
warren. he had an idea.

 moving and several of them trembled
where they sat.
     "well, this is a nice surprise, hazel," said bigwig at length. "or were you
expecting this when you took us into the wood?"
     hazel realized wearily that bigwig was probably going to be troublesome. he
was certainly no coward, but he was likely to remain steady only as long as he
could see his way clear and be sure of what to do. to him, perplexity was worse
than danger; and when he was perplexed he usually grew angry. the day before,
fiver's warning had troubled him, and he had spoken in anger to the threarah
and left the owsla. then, while he was in an uncertain mood about the idea of
leaving the warren, captain holly had appeared in capital time to be attacked and
to provide a perfect reason for their departure. now, at the sight of the river,
bigwig's assurance was leaking again and unless he, hazel, could restore it in
some way, they were likely to be in for trouble. he thought of the threarah and
his wily courtesy.

me."
     "it had killed before it met us," said blackberry with a shudder. "i saw the
blood on its lips."
     "a rat, perhaps, or pheasant chicks. lucky for us it had killed, otherwise it
might have been quicker. still, fortunately we did the right thing. we really came
out of it very well," said bigwig.
     fiver came limping down the path with pipkin. they, too, checked and stared
at the sight of the river.
     "what do you think we ought to do now, fiver?" asked hazel.
     fiver looked down at the water and twitched his ears.
     "we shall have to cross it," he said. "but i don't think i can swim, hazel. i'm
worn out, and pipkin's a good deal worse than i am."
     "cross it?" cried bigwig. "cross it? who's going to cross it? what do you want
to cross it for? i never heard such nonsense."

 all wild animals, rabbits can swim if they have to; and some even swim
when it suits them. rabbits have been known to live on the edge of a wood and
regularly swim a brook to feed in the fields beyond. but most rabbits avoid
swimming, and certainly an exhausted rabbit could not swim the enborne.
     "i don't want to jump in there," said speedwell.
     "why not just go along the bank?" asked hawkbit.
     hazel suspected that if fiver felt they ought to cross the river, it might be
dangerous not to. but how were the others to be persuaded? at this moment, as
he was still wondering what to say to them, he suddenly realized that something
had lightened his spirits. what could it be? a smell? a sound? then he knew.
nearby, across the river, a lark had begun to twitter and climb. it was morning. a
blackbird called one or two deep, slow notes and was followed by a wood pigeon.
soon they were in a gray twilight and could see that

ot flower for nearly two months yet. the only blooms
were a few early meadowsweet and a patch of pink butterbur. looking back at the
face of the bank, they could see that it was in fact dotted thickly with martins'
holes. there was a narrow foreshore at the foot of the little cliff and this was
littered with the rubbish of the colony -- sticks, droppings, feathers, a broken egg
and a dead nestling or two. the martins were now coming and going in numbers
over the water.
     hazel moved close to fiver and quietly edged him away from the others,
feeding as he went. when they were a little way off, and half concealed by a patch
of reeds, he said, "are you sure we've got to cross the river, fiver? what about
going along the bank one way or the other?"
     "no, we need to cross the river, hazel, so that we can get into those fields --
and on beyond them too. i know what we ought to be looking for -- a high, lonely
place with dry soil, where rabbits can see and hear all round and men hardly ever

     "yes, of course it would. but is there such a place?"
     "not near a river -- i needn't tell you that. but if you cross a river you start
going up again, don't you? we ought to be on the top -- on the top and in the
open."
     "but, fiver, i think they may refuse to go much further. and then again, you
say all this and yet you say you're too tired to swim?"
     "i can rest, hazel, but pipkin's in a pretty bad way. i think he's injured. we
may have to stay here half the day."
     "well, let's go and talk to the others. they may not mind staying. it's crossing
they're not going to fancy, unless something frightens them into it."
     as soon as they had made their way back, bigwig came across to them from the

must have broken loose. it may be on the lendri's scent, but the lendri will be
underground by now. what do you think will happen when it picks up our scent,
running from one side of the wood to the other, with dew on it? come on, let's get
over quickly,"
     hazel felt at a loss. in front of him stood bigwig, sodden wet, undaunted,
single-minded -- the very picture of decision. at his shoulder was fiver, silent and
twitching. he saw blackberry watching him intently, waiting for his lead and
disregarding bigwig's. then he looked at pipkin, huddled into a fold of sand,
more panic-stricken and helpless than any rabbit he had ever seen. at this
moment, up in the wood, there broke out an excited yelping and a jay began to
scold.
     hazel spoke through a kind of light-headed trance. "well, you'd better get on,
then," he said, "and anyone else who wants to. personally, i'm going to wait until
fiver

 and pipkin are fit to tackle it."
     "you silly blockhead!" cried bigwig. "we'll all be finished! we'll--"
     "don't stamp about," said hazel, "you may be heard. what do you suggest,
then?"
     "suggest? there's no suggesting to be done. those who can swim, swim. the

others will have to stay here and hope for the best. the dog may not come."
     "i'm afraid that won't do for me. i got pipkin into this and i'm going to get him
out."
     "well, you didn't get fiver into it, did you? he got you into it."
     hazel could not help noticing, with reluctant admiration, that although bigwig
had lost his temper, he was apparently in no hurry on his own account and
seemed less frightened than any of them. looking round for blackberry, he saw
that he had left them and was up at the top of the pool, where the narrow beach
tailed away into a gravel spit. his paws were half buried in the wet gravel and he
was nosing at something large and flat on the waterline. it l

wood.
     "blackberry," he said, "can you come back here a moment?"
     blackberry looked up, tugged out his paws and ran back.
     "hazel," he said quickly, "that's a piece of flat wood -- like that piece that closed
the gap by the green loose above the warren -- you remember? it must have
drifted down the river. so it floats. we could put fiver and pipkin on it and make
it float again. it might go across the river. can you understand?"
     hazel had no idea what he meant. blackberry's flood of apparent nonsense
only seemed to draw tighter the mesh of danger and bewilderment. as though
bigwig's angry impatience, pipkin's terror and the approaching dog were not
enough to contend with, the cleverest rabbit among them had evidently gone out
of his mind. he felt close to despair.
     "frithrah, yes, i see!" said an excited voice at his e

ar. it was fiver. "quick,
hazel, don't wait! come on, and bring pipkin!"
     it was blackberry who bullied the stupefied pipkin to his feet and forced him to
limp the few yards to the gravel spit. the piece of wood, hardly bigger than a large
rhubarb leaf, was lightly aground. blackberry almost drove pipkin onto it with his
claws. pipkin crouched shivering and fiver followed him aboard.
     "who's strong?" said blackberry. "bigwig! silver! push it out!"
     no one obeyed him. all squatted, puzzled and uncertain. blackberry buried his
nose in the gravel under the landward edge of the board and raised it, pushing.
the board tipped. pipkin squealed and fiver lowered his head and splayed his
claws. then the board righted itself and drifted out a few feet into the pool with
the two rabbits hunched upon it, rigid and motionless. it rotated slowly and they

     "frith and inlé!" said dandelion. "they're sitting on the water! why don't they
sink?"
     "they're sitting on the wood and the wood floats, can't you see?" said
blackberry. "now we swim over ourselves. can we start, hazel?"
     during the last few minutes hazel had been as near to losing his head as he
was ever to come. he had been at his wits' end, with no reply to bigwig's scornful
impatience except his readiness to risk his own life in company with fiver and
pipkin. he still could not understand what had happened, but at least he realized
that blackberry wanted him to show authority. his head cleared.
     "swim," he said. "everybody swim."
     he watched them as they went in. dandelion swam as well as he ran, swiftly
and easily. silver, too, was strong. the others paddled and scrambled over

     bigwig was still in the water, on the other side of the pool. he had swum to the
raft, put his head against it and was pushing it forward with heavy thrusts of his
back legs. "keep still," hazel heard him say in a quick, gulping voice. then he
sank. but a moment later he was up again and had thrust his head over the back
of the board. as he kicked and struggled, it tilted and then, while the rabbits
watched from the bank, moved slowly across the pool and grounded on the
opposite side. fiver pushed pipkin onto the stones and bigwig waded out beside
them, shivering and breathless.
     "i got the idea once blackberry had shown us," he said. "but it's hard to push it
when you're in the water. i hope it's not long to sunrise. i'm cold. let's get on."
     there was no sign of the dog as they made haste through the alders and up the
field to the first hedgerow. most of them had not understood blackberry's
discovery of the raft and at once forgot it. fiver, however, came over to where

"only a little way."
     they became widely separated as they straggled up the slope. silver and bigwig
led the way, with hazel and buckthorn a short distance behind. the rest idled
along, hopping a few yards and then pausing to nibble or to pass droppings on the
warm, sunny grass. silver was almost at the crest when suddenly, from halfway
up, there came a high screaming -- the sound a rabbit makes, not to call for help
or to frighten an enemy, but simply out of terror. fiver and pipkin, limping
behind the others, and conspicuously undersized and tired, were being attacked
by the crow. it had flown low along the ground. then, pouncing, it had aimed a
blow of its great bill at fiver, who just managed to dodge in time. now it was
leaping and hopping among the grass tussocks, striking at the two rabbits with
terrible darts of its head. crows aim at the eyes and pipkin, sensing this, had
buried his head in a clump of rank grass and was trying to burrow further in. it

they watched it clear the further hedge and disappear into the wood beyond the
river. in the silence there was a gentle, tearing sound as a grazing cow moved
nearer.
     bigwig strolled over to pipkin, muttering a ribald owsla lampoon.

     "hoi, hoi u embleer hrair,
     m'saion ulé hraka vair."*

     "come on, hlao-roo," he said. "you can get your head out now. having quite a
day, aren't we?"
     he turned away and pipkin tried to follow him. hazel remembered that fiver
had said he thought he was injured. now, as he watched him limping and
staggering up the slope, it occurred to him that he might actually be wounded in
some way. he kept trying to put his near-side front paw to the ground and then
drawing it up again, hopping on three legs.

     "i'll have a look at him as soon as they're settled under cover," he thought.
"poor little chap, he won't be able to get much further like that."
     at the top of the slope buckthorn was already leading the way into

patient effort hazel succeeded in working out enough of the stump to get a grip
with his teeth. the thorn came out smoothly and the wound bled. the spine was
so long and thick that hawkbit, who happened to be close by, woke speedwell to
have a look at it.
     "frith above, pipkin!" said speedwell, sniffing at the thorn where it lay on a
pebble. "you'd better collect a few more like that: then you can make a notice
board and frighten fiver. you might have poked the lendri's eye out for us, if
you'd only known."
     "lick the place, hlao," said hazel. "lick it until it feels better and then go to

they'll come in time."
     it was in fact a long time before all the rabbits had come back to the hollow in
the middle of the field. as he waited, hazel realized more fully than ever how
dangerous was their position, without holes, wandering in country they did not
know. the lendri, the dog, the crow, the marksman -- they had been lucky to
escape them. how long would their luck hold? would they really be able to travel
on as far as fiver's high place -- wherever it might be?
     "i'd settle for any decent, dry bank, myself," he thought, "as long as there was
some grass and no men with guns. and the sooner we can find one the better."
     hawkbit was the last to return and as he came up hazel set off at once. he
looked cautiously out from among the beans and then darted into the hedgerow.

     "it's the place that worries you," said hazel. "i don't like it myself, but it won't
go on forever."
     hawkbit looked sly and shifty. "we don't believe you know where we are
going," he said. "you didn't know about the road, did you? and you don't know
what there is in front of us."
     "look here," said hazel, "suppose you tell me what you want to do and i'll tell
you what i think about it."
     "we want to go back," said acorn. "we think fiver was wrong."
     "how can you go back through all we've come through?" replied hazel. "and
probably get killed for wounding an owsla officer, if you ever do get back? talk
sense, for frith's sake."
     "it wasn't we who wounded holly," said speedwell.
     "you were there and blackberry brought you there. do you think they won't

     hazel stopped as fiver approached, followed by bigwig.
     "hazel," said fiver, "could you come up on the bank with me for a few

     "and while you're there," said bigwig, scowling round at the others from under
the great sheaf of fur on his head, "i'll just have a few words with these three.
why don't you get washed, hawkbit? you look like the end of a rat's tail left in a
trap. and as for you, speedwell--"
     hazel did not wait to hear what speedwell looked like. following fiver, he
scrambled up the lumps and shelves of peat to the overhang of gravelly earth and
thin grass that topped them. as soon as fiver had found a place to clamber out,
he led the way along the edge to the bank which hazel had been looking at before
hawkbit spoke to him. it stood a few feet above the nodding, windy heather and
was open and grassy at the top. they climbed it and squatted down. to their right
the moon, smoky and yellow in thin night cloud, stood over a clump of distant
pine trees. th

ey looked southward across the dismal waste. hazel waited for fiver
to speak, but he remained silent.
     "what was it you wanted to say to me?" asked hazel at last.
     fiver made no reply and hazel paused in perplexity. from below, bigwig was
just audible.
     "and you, acorn, you dog-eared, dung-faced disgrace to a gamekeeper's gibbet,
if i only had time to tell you--"
     the moon sailed free of the cloud and lit the heather more brightly, but neither
hazel nor fiver moved from the top of the bank. fiver was looking far out beyond
the edge of the common. four miles away, along the southern skyline, rose the
seven-hundred-and-fifty-foot ridge of the downs. on the highest point, the beech
trees of cottington's clump were moving in a stronger wind than that which blew
across the heather.
     "look!" said fiver suddenly. "that's the place for us, hazel. high, lonely hills,
where the wind and the sound carry and the ground's as dry as straw in a barn.
that's wh

ere we ought to be. that's where we have to get to."
     hazel looked at the dim, far-off hills. obviously, the idea of trying to reach
them was out of the question. it might well prove to be all they could do to find
their way across the heather to some quiet field or copse bank like those they had
been used to. it was lucky that fiver had not come out with this foolish notion in
front of any of the others, especially as there was trouble enough already. if only
he could be persuaded to drop it here and now, there would be no harm done --
unless, indeed, he had already said anything to pipkin.
     "i don't think we could get the others to go as far as that, fiver," he said.
"they're frightened and tired as it is, you know. what we need is to find a safe
place soon, and i'd rather succeed in doing what we can than fail to do 
 
 ___________________________
 
what we
can't."
     fiver gave no sign of having heard him. he seemed to be lost in his own
thoughts. when he spoke again, it was as though he were talking to himself.
"there's a thick mist between the hills and us. i can't see through it, but through
it we shall have to go. or into it, anyway."
     "a mist?" said hazel. "what do you mean?"

     "we're in for some mysterious trouble," whispered fiver, "and it's not elil. it
feels more like -- like mist. like being deceived and losing our way."
     there was no mist around them. the may night was clear and fresh. hazel
waited in silence and after a time fiver said, slowly and expressionlessly, "but we
must go on, until we reach the hills." his voice sank and became that of a sleep-
talker. "until we reach the hills. the rabbit that goes back through the gap will
run his head into trouble. that running -- not wise. that running -- not safe.

 
 ___________________________
 
running -- not--" he trembled violently, kicked once or twice and became quiet.
     in the hollow below, bigwig seemed to be drawing to a close. "and now, you
bunch of mole-snouted, muck-raking, hutch-hearted sheep ticks, get out of my
sight sharp. otherwise i'll--" he became inaudible again.
     hazel looked once more at the faint line of the hills. then, as fiver stirred and
muttered beside him, he pushed him gently with one forepaw and nuzzled his
shoulder.
     fiver started. "what was i saying, hazel?" he asked. "i'm afraid i can't
remember. i meant to tell you--"
     "never mind," answered hazel. "we'll go down now. it's time we were getting
them on again. if you have any more queer feelings like that, keep close to me. i'll
look after you."

     when hazel and fiver reached the floor of the hollow they found blackberry
wailing for them, crouching on the peat and nibbling at a few brown stalks of
sedge grass.
     "hello," said hazel. "what's happened? where are the others?"
     "over there," answered blackberry. "there's been a fearful row. bigwig told
hawkbit and speedwell that he'd scratch them to pieces if they didn't obey him.

questions and no spirit left to force himself to think about them. behind him,
pipkin shivered in the damp, and he turned and nuzzled him -- much as the
general, with nothing left to do, might fall to considering the welfare of his
servant, simply because the servant happened to be there.
     the light grew stronger and soon he could see that a little way ahead there was
an open track of bare gravel. he limped out of the heather, sat on the stones and

shook the wet from his fur. he could see fiver's hills plainly now, greenish-gray
and seeming close in the rain-laden air. he could even pick out the dots of furze
bushes and stunted yew trees on the steep slopes. as he gazed at them, he heard
an excited voice further down the track.
     "he's done it! didn't i tell you he'd do it?"
     hazel turned his head and saw blackberry on the path. he was bedraggled and
exhausted, but it was he who was speaking. out of the heather behind him came
acorn, speedwell and buckthorn. all four rabbits we

     hazel did not know what to reply. he looked at them in silence and it was
acorn who spoke next.
     "come on!" he said. "who's going to be first into that field? i can still run." he
was off, slowly enough, down the slope, but when hazel stamped for him to stop
he did so at once.
     "where are the others?" said hazel. "dandelion? bigwig?"
     at that moment dandelion appeared out of the heather and sat on the path,
looking at the field. he was followed first by hawkbit and then by fiver. hazel
was watching fiver as he took in the sight of the field, when buckthorn drew his
attention back to the foot of the slope.
     "look, hazel," he said, "silver and bigwig are down there. they're waiting for
us."
     silver's light-gray fur showed up plainly against a low spray of gorse, but hazel
could not see bigwig until he sat up and ran toward them.
     "splendid, hazel," he said. "everybody's here. let's get them into that field."
     a few moments later they were under the silver

d hawkbit chased each other through the long grass. speedwell
jumped over the little brook that ran down the middle of the field and when
acorn tried to follow him and fell short, silver joked with him as he scrambled
out and rolled him in a patch of dead oak leaves until he was dry. as the sun rose
higher, shortening the shadows and drawing the dew from the grass, most of the
rabbits came wandering back to the sun-flecked shade among the cow parsley
along the edge of the ditch. here, hazel and fiver were sitting with dandelion
under a flowering wild cherry. the white petals spun down around them,
covering the grass and speckling their fur, while thirty feet above a thrush sang,
"cherry dew, cherry dew. knee deep, knee deep, knee deep."
     "well, this is the place all right, isn't it, hazel?" said dandelion lazily. "i

i'm in no particular hurry. but i've got an idea it may be going to rain before

     fiver looked as though he were about to speak, but then shook his ears and
turned to nibbling at a dandelion.
     "that looks a good bank, along the edge of the trees up there," answered hazel.
"what do you say, fiver? shall we go up there now or shall we wait a bit longer?"
     fiver hesitated and then replied, "just as you think, hazel."
     "well, there's no need to do any serious digging, is there?" said bigwig. "that
sort of thing's all right for does, but not for us."
     "still, we'd better make one or two scrapes, don't you think?" said hazel.
"something to give us shelter at a pinch. let's go up to the copse and look round.
we might as well take our time and make quite sure where we'd like to have
them. we don't want to have to do the work twice."

"the farm's a good way away and the fields between don't show any signs of elil at

were used a good deal. scent's fresh and there are the ends of those little white
sticks that they burn in their mouths. but that's all for the best, i reckon. we keep
away from the men and the men frighten the elil away."
     "why do the men come, do you suppose?" asked fiver.
     "who knows why men do anything? they may drive cows or sheep in the
fields, or cut wood in the copses. what does it matter? i'd rather dodge a man
than a stoat or a fox."
     "well, that's fine," said hazel. "you've found out a lot, bigwig, and all to the
good. we were just going to make some scrapes along the bank there. we'd better

although it is not work that they tackle at all seriously. during the morning the
digging proceeded in a light-hearted and intermittent way. the bank on each side
of the oak tree was bare and consisted of a light, gravelly soil. there were several
false starts and fresh choices, but by ni-frith they had three scrapes of a sort.
hazel, watching, lent help here and there and encouraged the others. every so
often he slipped back to look out over the field and make sure that all was safe.
only fiver remained solitary. he took no part in the digging but squatted on the
edge of the ditch, fidgeting backward and forward, sometimes nibbling and then
starting up suddenly as though he could hear some sound in the wood. after
speaking to him once or twice and receiving no reply, hazel thought it best to let
him alone. the next time he left the digging he kept away from fiver and sat
looking at the bank, as though entirely concerned with the work.
     a little while after ni-frith the sky clouded

 over thickly. the light grew dull and
they could smell rain approaching from the west. the blue tit that had been
swinging on a bramble, singing "heigh ho, go-and-get-another-bit-of-moss,"
stopped his acrobatics and flew into the wood. hazel was just wondering whether
it would be worthwhile starting a side passage to link bigwig's hole to
dandelion's, when he felt a stamp of warning from somewhere close by. he
turned quickly. it was fiver who had stamped and he was now staring intently
across the field.
     beside a tussock of grass a little way outside the opposite copse, a rabbit was
sitting and gazing at them. its ears were erect and it was evidently giving them the
full attention of sight, smell and hearing. hazel rose on his hind legs, paused, and
then sat back on his haunches, in full view. the other rabbit remained motionless.
hazel, never taking his eyes off it, heard three or four of the others coming up
behind him. af

rabbits with an air of being too polite to comment. "but it can be hard to defend
oneself against the weather. there's going to be rain and i don't think your
scrapes are finished." he looked at bigwig, as though waiting for him to ask
another question. bigwig seemed confused. clearly, he could make no more of the
situation than hazel. there was silence except for the sound of the rising wind.
above them, the branches of the oak tree were beginning to creak and sway.
suddenly, fiver came forward.
     "we don't understand you," he said. "it's best to say so and try to get things
clear. can we trust you? are there many other rabbits here? those are the things
we want to know."
     cowslip showed no more concern at fiver's tense manner than he had at
anything that had gone before. he drew a forepaw down the back of one ear and
then replied,
     "i think you're puzzling yourselves unnecessarily. but if you want the answers
to your questions, then i'd say yes, you can trust

kin inside their ears.
     "fine, big fellow, isn't he?" said buckthorn. "he doesn't look as though he had
much to bother about, living here."
     "what should we do, hazel, do you think?" asked silver. "it's true what he said,
isn't it? these scrapes -- well, we can crouch in them out of the weather, but no
more than that. and as we can't all get into one, we shall have to split up."
     "we'll join them together," said hazel, "and while we're doing that i'd like to
talk about what he said. fiver, bigwig and blackberry, can you come with me?
the rest of you split how you like."
     the new hole was short, narrow and rough. there was no room for two rabbits
to pass. four were like beans in a pod. for the first time, hazel began to realize
how much they had left behind. the holes and tunnels of an old warren become
smooth, reassuring and comfortable with use. there are no snags or rough
corners. every length smells of rabbit -- of that great, indestructible flood of
rabbitry in which eac

to join their warren?"
     "fools attract elil by being easy prey," said bigwig, cleaning the mud out of his
whiskers and blowing through his long front teeth. "and we're fools until we've
learned to live here. safer to teach us, perhaps. i don't know -- give it up. but i'm
not afraid to go and find out. if they do try any tricks, they'll find i know a few as
well. i wouldn't mind taking a chance, to sleep somewhere more comfortable than
this. we haven't slept since yesterday afternoon."
     "fiver?"
     "i think we ought to have nothing to do with that rabbit or his warren. we
ought to leave this place at once. but what's the good of talking?"
     cold and damp, hazel felt impatient. he had always been accustomed to rely
on fiver and now, when he really needed him, he was letting them down.
blackberry's reasoning had been first-rate and bigwig had at least shown which
way any sound-hearted rabbit would be likely to lean. apparently the only
contribution fiver could make was this beetle

-spirited vaporing. he tried to
remember that fiver was undersized and that they had had an anxious time and
were all weary. at this moment the soil at the far end of the burrow began to
crumble inward, then it fell away and silver's head and front paws appeared.
     "here we are," said silver cheerfully. "we've done what you wanted, hazel, and
buckthorn's through next door. but what i'd like to know is, how about what's-
his-name? cowpat -- no -- cowslip? are we going to his warren or not? surely

bigwig, cheerful at the prospect of action. the steady, reliable silver. dandelion,
the dashing storyteller, so eager to be off that he jumped the ditch and ran a little
way into the field before stopping to wait for the rest. buckthorn, perhaps the
most sensible and staunch of them all. pipkin, who looked round for hazel and
then came over to wait beside him. acorn, hawkbit and speedwell, decent
enough rank-and-filers as long as they were not pushed beyond their limits. last
of all came fiver, dejected and reluctant as a sparrow in the frost. as hazel turned
from the hole, the clouds in the west broke slightly and there was a sudden dazzle
of watery, pale gold light.
     "o el-ahrairah!" thought hazel. "these are rabbits we're going to meet. you
know them as well as you know us. let it be the right thing that i'm doing."
     "now, brace up, fiver!" he said aloud. "we're waiting for you, and getting
wetter every moment."

 manner of tentative appraisals, slowly moved, like
a hemisphere of the world into summer, to a warmer, brighter region of mutual
liking and approval, until all felt sure that they had nothing to fear. pipkin, some
way away from hazel, crouched at his ease between two huge rabbits who could
have broken his back in a second, while buckthorn and cowslip started a playful
scuffle, nipping each other like kittens and then breaking off to comb their ears in
a comical pretense of sudden gravity. only fiver sat alone and apart. he seemed
either ill or very much depressed, and the strangers avoided him instinctively.
     the knowledge that the gathering was safely round the corner came to hazel in
the form of a recollection of silver's head and paws breaking through gravel. at
once, he felt warm and relaxed. he had already crossed the whole length of the
hall and was pressed close to two rabbits, a buck and a doe, each of whom was
fully as large as cowslip. when both together took a few slow hops

 them.
     the rain was still falling steadily. the night was dark and, for may, cold. they
all three hunched themselves in the grass and nibbled while the rain ran off their
fur in streams.
     "my goodness, hazel," said blackberry, "did you really want to silflay? this is
terrible! i was just going to eat whatever it is they have and then go to sleep.
what's the idea?"
     "i don't know," replied hazel. "i suddenly felt i had to get out and i wanted
your company. i can see what's troubling fiver; though he'll get over it, i dare say.
there is something strange about these rabbits. do you know they push stones
into the wall?"
     "they do what?"
     hazel explained. blackberry was as much at a loss as he had been himself. "but
i'll tell you another thing," he said. "bigwig wasn't so far wrong. they do sing like
the birds. i was in a burrow belonging to a rabbit called betony. his doe has a
litter and she was making a noise over them rather like a robin in autumn. to
send them to sleep

k and looked round him again.
several rabbits were already running down the field toward a distant hedge
dappled white with great patches of maybloom. he saw bigwig and silver and
went to join them, flicking the wet off his front paws step by step, like a cat.
     "i hope your friends have been looking after you as well as these fellows have
looked after us, hazel," said bigwig. "silver and i really feel at home again. if you
ask me, i reckon we've all made a big change for the better. even if fiver's wrong
and nothing terrible has happened back at the old warren, i'd still say we're better

off here. are you coming along to feed?"
     "what is this business about going to feed, do you know?" asked hazel.
     "haven't they told you? apparently there's flayrah to be had down the fields.
most of them go every day."
     (rabbits usually eat grass, as everyone knows. but more appetizing food -- e.g.,
lettuce or carrots, for which they will make an expedition or rob a garden -- is
flayrah.)

eral times. but cowslip was encouraging and he was determined to keep up
his position as the resourceful leader of the newcomers. at his suggestion they
both waited at the mouth of one of the larger holes to see how his companions
were shaping. they all seemed to be making an effort and doing their best,
although the smaller rabbits -- especially pipkin -- clearly found the task an
awkward one.
     "cheer up, pipkin," said hazel. "think how much you'll enjoy eating it tonight.
anyway, i'm sure fiver must find it as hard as you: he's just as small."
     "i don't know where he is," said pipkin. "have you seen him?"
     now that hazel thought about it, he had not. he became a little anxious and,
as he returned across the field with cowslip, did his best to explain something of
fiver's peculiar temperament. "i do hope he's all right," he said. "i think perhaps
i'll go and look for him when we've carried this next lot. have you any idea where
he might be?"
     he waited for cowslip to reply,
 
 ___________________________
 
 but he was disappointed. after a few moments
cowslip said, "look, do you see those jackdaws hanging round the carrots?
they've been a nuisance for several days now. i must get someone to try to keep
them off until we've finished carrying. but they're really too big for a rabbit to
tackle. now, sparrows--"
     "what's that got to do with fiver?" asked hazel sharply.
     "in fact," said cowslip, breaking into a run, "i'll go myself."
     but he did not engage the jackdaws and hazel saw him pick up another carrot
and start back with it. annoyed, he joined buckthorn and dandelion and the
three of them returned together. as they came up to the warren bank he suddenly
caught sight of fiver. he was sitting half concealed under the low spread of a yew
tree on the edge of the copse, some way from the holes of the warren. putting

arrot, hazel ran across, scrambled up the bank and joined him on the

bare ground under the low, close boughs. fiver said nothing and continued to
stare over the field.
     "aren't you coming to learn to carry, fiver?" asked hazel at length. "it's not too
difficult once you get the hang of it."
     "i'll have nothing to do with it," answered fiver in a low voice. "dogs -- you're
like dogs carrying sticks."
     "fiver! are you trying to make me angry? i'm not going to get angry because
you call me stupid names. but you're letting the others do all the work."
     "i'm the one who ought to get angry," said fiver. "but i'm no good at it, that's
the trouble. why should they listen to me? half of them think i'm mad. you're to
blame, hazel, because you know i'm not and still you won't listen."
     "so you don't like this warren any better even now? well, i think you're wrong.

are rabbits down there, trotting along like a lot of squirrels with nuts.
how can that be right?"
     "well, i'd say they've copied a good idea from the squirrels and that makes
them better rabbits."
     "do you suppose the man, whoever he is, puts the roots out there because he
has a kind heart? what's he up to?"
     "he's just throwing away rubbish. how many rabbits have had a good meal off
men's rubbish heaps? shot lettuces, old turnips? you know we all do, when we
can. it's not poisoned, fiver, i can tell you that. and if he wanted to shoot rabbits
he's had plenty of chances this morning. but he hasn't done it."
     fiver seemed to grow even smaller as he flattened himself on the hard earth.
"i'm a fool to try to argue," he said miserably. "hazel -- dear old hazel -- it's
simply that i know there's something unnatural and evil twisted all round this
place. i don't know what it is, so no wonder i can't talk about it. i keep getting
near it, though. you know how you poke your nose aga

it up against an apple tree, but you still can't bite the bark because of the wire. i'm
close to this -- whatever it is -- but i can't grip it. if i sit here alone i may reach it
yet."
     "fiver, why not do as i say? have a meal on those roots and then go
underground and sleep. you'll feel all the better for it."
     "i tell you i'll have nothing to do with the place," said fiver. "as for going
underground, i'd rather go back over the heather. the roof of that hall is made of
bones."
     "no, no -- tree roots. but, after all, you were underground all night."
     "i wasn't," said fiver.
     "what? where were you, then?"
     "here."
     "all night?"
     "yes. a yew tree gives good shelter, you know."
     hazel was now seriously worried. if fiver's horrors had kept him above ground
all night in the rain, oblivious of cold and prowling elil, then clearly it was not

oing to be easy to talk him out of them. he was silent for some time. at last he
said, "what a shame! i still think you'd do better to come and join us. but i'll let

you alone now and come and see how you're feeling later. don't go eating the yew
tree, either."
     fiver made no reply and hazel went back to the field.
     the day was certainly not one to encourage foreboding. by ni-frith it was so
hot that the lower part of the field was humid. the air was heavy with thick,
herbal smells, as though it were already late june; the water mint and marjoram,
not yet flowering, gave off scent from their leaves and here and there an early
meadowsweet stood in bloom. the chiffchaff was busy all morning, high in a
silver birch near the abandoned holes across the dip; a

nd from deep in the copse,
somewhere by the disused well, came the beautiful song of the blackcap. by early
afternoon there was a stillness of heat, and a herd of cows from the higher fields
slowly grazed their way down into the shade. only a few of the rabbits remained
above ground. almost all were asleep in the burrows. but still fiver sat alone
under the yew tree.
     in the early evening hazel sought out bigwig and together they ventured into
the copse behind the warren. at first they moved cautiously, but before long they
grew confident at finding no trace of any creature larger than a mouse.
     "there's nothing to smell," said bigwig, "and no tracks. i think cowslip's told
us no more than the truth. there really aren't any elil here. different from that
wood where we crossed the river. i don't mind telling you, hazel,

he said they weren't fighters. so they're keeping up a mystery to stay even with us.
it's best just to put up with it. we don't want to upset them and it's bound to
smooth itself out in time."
     "there's more rain coming tonight," said bigwig. "soon, too, i think. let's go
underground and see if we can get them to talk a bit more freely."
     "i think that's something we can only wait for. but i agree about going
underground now. and for goodness' sake let's get fiver to come with us. he
troubles me. do you know he was out all night in the rain?"
     as they went back through the copse hazel recounted his talk with fiver that
morning. they found him under the yew tree and after a rather stormy scene,
during which bigwig grew rough and impatient, he was bullied rather than
persuaded into going down with them into the great burrow.
     it was crowded, and as the rain began to fall more rabbits came down the runs.
they pushed about, cheerful and chattering. t

ng," he added hastily.
     "el-ahrairah is a trickster," said buckthorn, "and rabbits will always need
tricks."
     "no," said a new voice from the further end of the hall, beyond cowslip.
"rabbits need dignity and, above all, the will to accept their fate."
     "we think silverweed is one of the best poets we've had for many months,"
said cowslip. "his ideas have a great following. would you like to hear him now?"
     "yes, yes," said voices from all sides. "silverweed!"
     "hazel," said fiver suddenly, "i want to get a clear idea of this silverweed, but i
daren't go closer by myself. will you come with me?"
     "why, fiver, whatever do you mean? what is there to be afraid of?"
     "oh, frith help me!" said fiver, trembling. "i can smell him from here. he
terrifies me."
     "oh, fiver, don't be absurd! he just smells the same as the rest of them."
     "he smells like barley rained down and left to rot in the fields. he smells like a
wounded mole that can't get underground."

     far away, to the heart of light, the silence.

     fiver, as he listened, had shown a mixture of intense absorption and
incredulous horror. at one and the same time he seemed to accept every word
and yet to be stricken with fear. once he drew in his breath, as though startled to
recognize his own half-known thoughts; and when the poem was ended he
seemed to be struggling to come to himself. he bared his teeth and licked his lips,
as blackberry had done before the dead hedgehog on the road.

 still, either fascinated
or else trusting to its natural inconspicuousness to remain unnoticed. but then,
unless the fascination is too powerful, there comes the point when keeping still is
discarded and the rabbit, as though breaking a spell, turns in an instant to its
other resource -- flight. so it seemed to be with fiver now. suddenly he leaped up
and began to push his way violently across the great burrow. several rabbits were
jostled and turned angrily on him, but he took no notice. then he came to a place
where he could not push between two heavy warren bucks. he became hysterical,
kicking and scuffling, and hazel, who was behind him, had difficulty in
preventing a fight.
     "my brother's a sort of poet, too, you know," he said to the bristling strangers.
"things affect him very strongly sometimes and he d

oesn't always know why."
     one of the rabbits seemed to accept what hazel had said, but the other replied,
"oh, another poet? let's hear him, then. that'll be some return for my shoulder,
anyway. he's scratched a great tuft of fur out."
     fiver was already beyond them and thrusting toward the further entrance
tunnel. hazel felt that he must follow him. but after all the trouble that he

himself had taken to be friendly, he felt so cross at the way in which fiver had
antagonized their new friends that as he passed bigwig, he said, "come and help
me to get some sense into him. the last thing we want is a fight now." he felt that
fiver really deserved a short touch of bigwig.
     they followed fiver up the run and overtook him at the entrance. before either
of them could say a word, he turned and began to speak as though they had asked
him a question.
     "you felt it, then? and you want to know whether i did? of course i did. that's
the worst part of i

ly that covers the whole sky: and we shall never see to go by
frith's light any more. oh, what will become of us? a thing can be true and still be
desperate folly, hazel."
     "what on earth's all this?" said hazel to bigwig in perplexity.
     "he's talking about that lop-eared nitwit of a poet down there," answered
bigwig. "i know that much. but why he seems to think we should want to have
anything to do with him and his fancy talk -- that's more than i can imagine. you
can save your breath, fiver. the only thing that's bothering us is the row you've
started. as for silverweed, all i can say is, i'll keep silver and he can be just plain
weed."
     fiver gazed back at him with eyes that, like a fly's, seemed larger than his head.
"you think that," he said. "you believe that. but each of you, in his own way, is
thick in that mist. where is the--"
     hazel interrupted him and as he did so fiver started. "fiver, i won't pretend
that i didn't follow you up here to speak angrily. you've end

angered our good
start in this warren--
     "endangered?" cried fiver. "endangered? why, the whole place--"
     "be quiet. i was going to be angry, but you're obviously so much upset that it
would be pointless. but what you are going to do now is to come underground
with the two of us and sleep. come on! and don't say any more for the moment."
     one respect in which rabbits' lives are less complicated than those of humans
is that they are not ashamed to use force. having no alternative, fiver
accompanied hazel and bigwig to the burrow where hazel had spent the previous
night. there was no one there and they lay down and slept.

     it was cold, it was cold and the roof was made of bones. the roof was made of
the interlaced sprays of the yew tree, stiff twigs twisted in and out, over and
under, hard as ice and set with dull red berries. "come on, hazel," said cowslip.
"we're going to carry the yew berries home in our mouths and eat them in the
great burrow. your friends must learn to do that if they want to go our way." "no!
no!" cried fiver. "hazel, no!" but then came bigwig, twisting in and out of the
branches, his mouth full of berries. "look," said bigwig, "i can do it. i'm running
another way. ask me where, hazel! ask me where! ask me where!" then they
were running another way, running, not to the warren but over the fields in the
cold, and bigwig dropped the berries -- blood-red drops, red droppings hard as
wire. "it's no good," he said. "no good biting them. they're cold."
     hazel woke. he was in the burrow. he shivered. 
 
 ___________________________
 
why was there no warmth of
rabbit bodies lying close together? where was fiver? he sat up. nearby, bigwig
was stirring and twitching in his sleep, searching for warmth, trying to press
against another rabbit's body no longer there. the shallow hollow in the sandy
floor where fiver had lain was not quite cold: but fiver was gone.
     "fiver!" said hazel in the dark.
     as soon as he had spoken he knew there would be no reply. he pushed bigwig
with his nose, butting urgently. "bigwig! fiver's gone! bigwig!"
     bigwig was wide awake on the instant and hazel had never felt so glad of his
sturdy readiness.
     "what did you say? what's wrong?"
     "fiver's gone."
     "where's he gone?"
     "silf -- outside. it can only be silf. you know he wouldn't go wandering about in
the warren. he hates it."
     "he's a nuisance, isn't he? he's left this burrow cold, too. you think he's in
danger, don't you? you want to go and look for him?"
     "yes, i must. he's upset and overwrought an

to push us," said bigwig, "we may as well make sure the place
isn't crawling with stoats and owls before we go out."
     at that moment a brown owl's call sounded from the opposite wood. it was the

first call, and by instinct they both crouched motionless, counting four heartbeats
until the second followed.
     "it's moving away," said hazel.
     "how many field mice say that every night, i wonder? you know the call's
deceptive. it's meant to be."
     "well, i can't help it," said hazel. "fiver's somewhere out there and i'm going
after him. you were right, anyway. it is light -- just."
     "shall we look under the yew tree first?"
     but fiver was not under the yew tree. the light, as it grew, began to show the
upper field, while the distant hedge and brook remained dark, linear shapes
below. bigwig jumped down from the bank into the field and ran in a long curve
across the wet grass. he stopped almost opposite the hole by which they had
come up, and hazel joined him.
     "here's

his line, all right," said bigwig. "fresh, too. from the hole straight
down toward the brook. he won't be far away."
     when raindrops are lying it is easy to see where grass has recently been
crossed. they followed the line down the field and reached the hedge beside the
carrot ground and the source of the brook. bigwig had been right when he said
the line was fresh. as soon as they had come through the hedge they saw fiver.
he was feeding, alone. a few fragments of carrot were still lying about near the
spring, but he had left these untouched and was eating the grass not far from the
gnarled crab-apple tree. they approached and he looked up.
     hazel said nothing and began to feed beside him. he was now regretting that
he had brought bigwig. in the darkness before morning and the first shock of
discovering that fiver was gone, bigwig had been a comfort and a stand-by. but
now, as he saw fiver, small and familia

r, incapable of hurting anyone or of
concealing what he felt, trembling in the wet grass, either from fear or from cold,
his anger melted away. he felt only sorry for him and sure that, if they could stay
alone together for a while, fiver would come round to an easier state of mind. but
it was probably too late to persuade bigwig to be gentle: he could only hope for
the best.
     contrary to his fears, however, bigwig remained as silent as himself. evidently
he had been expecting hazel to speak first and was somewhat at a loss. for some
time all three moved on quietly over the grass, while the shadows grew stronger
and the wood pigeons clattered among the distant trees. hazel was beginning to
feel that all would be well and tha

t bigwig had more sense than he had given him
credit for, when fiver sat up on his hind legs, cleaned his face with his paws and
then, for the first time, looked directly at him.
     "i'm going now," he said. "i feel very sad. i'd like to wish you well, hazel, but
there's no good to wish you in this place. so just goodbye."
     "but where are you going, fiver?"
     "away. to the hills, if i can get there."
     "by yourself, alone? you can't. you'd die."
     "you wouldn't have a hope, old chap," said bigwig. "something would get you
before ni-frith."
     "no," said fiver very quietly. "you are closer to death than i."
     "are you trying to frighten me, you miserable little lump of chattering

chickweed?" cried bigwig. "i've a good mind--"
     "wait, bigwig," said hazel. "don't speak roughly to him."
     "why, you said yourself--" began bigwi

     "i know. but i feel differently now. i'm sorry, bigwig. i was going to ask you to
help me to make him come back to the warren. but now -- well, i've always found
that there was something in what fiver had to say. for the last two days i've
refused to listen to him and i still think he's out of his senses. but i haven't the
heart to drive him back to the warren. i really believe that for some reason or
other the place is frightening him out of his wits. i'll go with him a little way and
perhaps we can talk. i can't ask you to risk it, too. anyway, the others ought to
know what we're doing and they won't unless you go and tell them. i'll be back

wig stared. then he turned furiously on fiver. "you wretched little black
beetle," he said. "you've never learned to obey orders, have you? it's me, me, me
all the time. 'oh, i've got a funny feeling in my toe, so we must all go and stand on
our heads!' and now we've found a fine warren and got into it without even
having to fight, you've got to do your best to upset everyone! and then you risk
the life of one of the best rabbits we've got, just to play nursey while you go
wandering about like a moonstruck field mouse. well, i'm finished w

i'm going back to the warren to make sure everyone else
is finished with you as well. and they will be -- don't make any mistake about
that."
     he turned and dashed back through the nearest gap in the hedge. on the
instant, a fearful commotion began on the farther side. there were sounds of
kicking and plunging. a stick flew into the air. then a flat, wet clod of dead leaves
shot clean through the gap and landed clear of the hedge, close to hazel. the
brambles thrashed up and down. hazel and fiver stared at each other, both
fighting against the impulse to run. what enemy was at work on the other side of
the hedge? there were no cries -- no spitting of a cat, no squealing of a rabbit --
only the crackling of twigs and the tearing of the grass in violence.
     by an effort of courage against all instinct, hazel forced himself forward into
the gap, with fiver following. a terrible sight lay before them. the rotten leaves
had been thrown up in showers. the earth had been laid bare and was s

a pause. then bigwig's back legs began to kick once more, but
feebly. his ears drooped. his eyes opened unseeing and the whites showed
bloodshot as the brown irises rolled one way and the other. after a moment his
voice came thick and low, bubbling out of the bloody spume in his mouth.
     "owsla -- no good -- biting wire. peg -- got to -- dig out."
     a convulsion shook him and he scrabbled at the ground, covering himself in a
mask of wet earth and blood. then he was still again.
     "run, fiver, run to the warren," cried hazel. "get the others -- blackberry,
silver. be quick! he'll die."
     fiver was off up the field like a hare. hazel, left alone, tried to understand what
was needed. what was the peg? how was he to dig it out? he looked down at the
foul mess before him. bigwig was lying across the wire, which came out under his
belly and seemed to disappear into the ground. hazel struggled with his own
incomprehension. bigwig had said, "dig." that at least he understood. he began

thing smooth and firm. as he paused, perplexed, he found
blackberry at his shoulder.
     "bigwig just spoke," he said to him, "but i don't think he can now. he said, 'dig
out the peg.' what does that mean? what have we got to do?"
     "wait a moment," said blackberry. "let me think, and try not to be impatient."
     hazel turned his head and looked down the course of the brook. far away,
between the two copses, he could see the cherry tree where two days before he
had sat with blackberry and fiver in the sunrise. he remembered how bigwig had
chased hawkbit through the long grass, forgetting the quarrel of the previous
night in the joy of their arrival. he could see hawkbit running toward him now
and two or three of the others -- silver, dandelion and pipkin. dandelion, well in
front, dashed up to the gap and checked, twitching and staring.
     "what is it, hazel? what's happened? fiver said--"
     "bigwig's in a wire. let him alone till blackberry tells us. stop the others

nd."
     dandelion turned and raced back as pipkin came up.
     "is cowslip coming?" said hazel. "perhaps he knows--"
     "he wouldn't come," replied pipkin. "he told fiver to stop talking about it."
     "told him what?" asked hazel incredulously. but at that moment blackberry
spoke and hazel was beside him in a flash.
     "this is it," said blackberry. "the wire's on a peg and the peg's in the ground --
there, look. we've got to dig it out. come on -- dig beside it."
     hazel dug once more, his forepaws throwing up the soft, wet soil and slipping
against the hard sides of the peg. dimly, he was aware of the others waiting
nearby. after a time he was forced to

he hole and rubbed the mud off his face.
     "the peg's narrower down there," he said. "it tapers. i think it could be bitten
through, but i can't get my teeth to it."

     "send pipkin in," said blackberry. "he's smaller."
     pipkin plunged into the hole. they could hear the wood splintering under his
teeth -- a sound like a mouse in a shed wainscot at midnight. he came out with
his nose bleeding.
     "the splinters prick you and it's hard to breathe, but the peg's nearly through."
     "fiver, go in," said hazel.
     fiver was not long in the hole. he, too, came out bleeding.
     "it's broken in two. it's free."
     blackberry pressed his nose against bigwig's head. as he nuzzled him gently
the head rolled sideways and back again.
     "bigwig," said blackberry in his ear, "the peg's out."
     there was no response. bigwig lay still as before. a great fly settled on one of
his ears. blackberry thrust at it angrily and it flew up, buzzing, into the sunshine.
     "i think he's go

all of them -- even he himself -- put what had
happened out of mind, forever.
     "my heart has joined the thousand, for my friend stopped running today," he
said to blackberry, quoting a rabbit proverb.
     "if only it were not bigwig," said blackberry. "what shall we do without him?"
     "the others are waiting," said hazel. "we have to stay alive. there has to be
something for them to think about. help me, or it will be more than i can do."
     he turned away from the body and looked for fiver among the rabbits behind
him. but fiver was nowhere to be seen and hazel was afraid to ask for him, in
case to do so should seem like weakness and a need for comfort.
     "pipkin," he snapped, "why don't you clean up your face and stop the bleeding?
the smell of blood attracts elil. you know that, don't you?"
     "yes, hazel. i'm sorry. will bigwig--"
     "and another thing," said hazel desperately. "what was it you were telling me
about cowslip? did you say he told fiver to be quiet?"
     
 
 ___________________________
 
"yes, hazel. fiver came into the warren and told us about the snare, and that
poor bigwig--"
     "yes, all right. and then cowslip--?"
     "cowslip and strawberry and the others pretended not to hear. it was
ridiculous, because fiver was calling out to everybody. and then as we were
running out silver said to cowslip, 'surely you're coming?' and cowslip simply
turned his back. so then fiver went up and spoke to him very quietly, but i heard

what cowslip answered. he said, 'hills or inlé, it's all one to me where you go.
you hold your tongue.' and then he struck at fiver and scratched his ear."
     "i'll kill him," gasped a low, choking voice behind them. they all leaped round.
bigwig had raised his head and was supporting himself on his forepaws alone. his
body was twisted and his hind parts and back legs still lay along the ground. his
eyes were open, but his face was such a

cowards. let's drive them out -- kill them! take the warren and live there
ourselves!"
     "yes! yes!" they all answered. "come on! back to the warren! down with
cowslip! down with silverweed! kill them!"
     "o embleer frith!" cried a squealing voice in the long grass.
     at this shocking impiety, the tumult died away. they looked about them,
wondering who could have spoken. there was silence. then, from between two
great tussocks of hair grass came fiver, his eyes blazing with a frantic urgency. he
growled and gibbered at them like a witch hare and those nearest to him fell back
in fear. even hazel could not have said a word for his life. they realized that he
was speaking.
     "the warren? you're going to the warren? you fools! that warren's nothing but
a death hole! the whole place is one foul elil's larder! it's snared -- everywhere,
every day! that explains everything: everything that's happened since we came
here."

but one strict rule they had; oh yes, the strictest. no one must ever ask where
another rabbit was and anyone who asked 'where?' -- except in a song or a poem
-- must be silenced. to say 'where?' was bad enough, but to speak openly of the
wires -- that was intolerable. for that they would scratch and kill."
     he stopped. no one moved. then, in the silence, bigwig lurched to his feet,
swayed a moment, tottered a few steps toward fiver and fell again. fiver paid him
no heed, but looked from one to another among the rabbits. then he began
speaking again.
     "and then we came, over the heather in the night. wild rabbits, making
scrapes across the valley. the warren rabbits didn't show themselves at once.
they needed to think what was best to be done. but they hit on it quite soon. to
bring us into the warren and tell us nothing. don't you see? the farmer only sets
so many snares at a time, and if one rabbit dies, the others w

that hazel should tell them our adventures, blackberry,

ashamed of his own, and who likes an open, honest tale from someone he's
deceiving? do you want me to go on? i tell you, every single thing that's happened
fits like a bee in a foxglove. and kill them, you say, and help ourselves to the great
burrow? we shall help ourselves to a roof of bones, hung with shining wires! help
ourselves to misery and death!"
     fiver sank down into the grass. bigwig, still trailing his horrible, smooth peg,
staggered up to him and touched his nose with his own.
     "i'm still alive, fiver," he said. "so are all of us. you've bitten through a bigger

peg than this one i'm dragging. tell us what to do."
     "do?" replied fiver. "why, go -- now. i told cowslip we were going before i left
the burrow."
     "where?" said bigwig. but it was hazel who answered.
     "to the hills," he said.

motionless, with silver at his side.
     "hazel," said strawberry, "are you going away?"
     hazel made no answer, but silver said sharply, "what's that to you?"
     "take me with you." there was no reply and he repeated, "take me with you."
     "we don't care for creatures who deceive us," said silver. "better go back to
nildro-hain. no doubt she's less particular."
     strawberry gave a kind of choking squeal, as though he had been wounded. he
looked from silver to hazel and then to fiver. at last, in a pitiful whisper, he said,
     "the wires."
     silver was about to answer, but hazel spoke first.
     "you can come with us," he said. "don't say any more. poor fellow."
     a few minutes later the rabbits had crossed the cart track and vanished into
the copse beyond. a magpie, seeing some light-colored object conspicuous on the
empty slope, flew closer to look. but all that lay there was a splintered peg and a
twisted length of wire.

foreleg, and the wound, in the manner of a rat bite, was irritant and
painful. skirting a small lake, they had stared to see a great gray fisher bird that
stabbed and paddled in the sedge, until a flight of wild duck had frightened them
away with their clamor. they had crossed more than half a mile of open pasture
without a trace of cover, expecting every moment some attack that did not come.
they had heard the unnatural humming of a pylon in the summer air; and had
actually gone beneath it, on fiver's assurance that it could do them no harm. now
they lay under the spindle trees and sniffed in weariness and doubt at the strange,
bare country round them.

     since leaving the warren of the snares they had become warier, shrewder, a
tenacious band who understood each other and worked together. there was no
more quarreling. the truth about the warren had been a grim shock. they had
come closer together, relying on and valuing each other's capacities. they knew
now that it was on these and o

g to waste anything they possessed between them. in spite of
hazel's efforts beside the snare, there was not one of them who had not turned
sick at heart to think that bigwig was dead and wondered, like blackberry, what
would become of them now. without hazel, without blackberry, buckthorn and
pipkin -- bigwig would have died. without himself he would have died, for which
else, of them all, would not have stopped running after such punishment? there
was no more questioning of bigwig's strength, fiver's insight, blackberry's wits or
hazel's authority. when the rats came, buckthorn and silver had obeyed bigwig
and stood their ground. the rest had followed hazel when he roused them and,
without explanation, told them to go quickly outside the barn. later, hazel had
said that there was nothing for it but to cross the open pasture and under silver's
direction they had crossed it, with dandelion running ahead to reconnoiter.
when fiver said the iron tree was harmless they believed him.

sleep and at the sound of scratching had started up at once. he would not let
silver and buckthorn fight alone, but he had felt obliged to leave the worst of it to
them. for the first time in his life, bigwig had found himself driven to moderation
and prudence.
     as the sun sank lower and touched the edge of the cloud belt on the horizon,
hazel came out from under the branches and looked carefully round the lower
slope. then he stared upward over the anthills, to the open down rising above.
fiver and acorn followed him out and fell to nibbling at a patch of sainfoin. it was
new to them, but they did not need to be told that it was good and it raised their
spirits. hazel turned back and joined them among the big, rosy-veined, magenta
flower spikes.
     "fiver," he said, "let me get this right. you want us to climb up this place,
however far it is, and find shelter on the top. is that it?"
     "yes, hazel."
     "but the top must be very high. i can't even see it from here. it'll be ope

tired out. i'm sure it's dangerous to stay here. we've nowhere to run to. we don't
know the country and we can't get underground. but it seems out of the question
for everybody to climb up there tonight. we should be even less safe."
     "we shall be forced to dig, shan't we?" said acorn. "this place is almost as
open as that heather we crossed, and the trees won't hide us from anything
hunting on four feet."
     "it would have been the same any time we came," said fiver.
     "i'm not saying anything against it, fiver," replied acorn, "but we need holes.
it's a bad place not to be able to get underground."
     "before everyone goes up to the top," said hazel, "we ought to find out what it's
like. i'm going up myself to have a look round. i'll be as quick as i can and you'll
have to hope for the best until i get back. you can rest and feed, anyway."
     "you're not going alone," said fiver firmly.

 trees and hedges. now, with his head pointing
upward, he found himself gazing at the ridge, as over the skyline came the silent,
moving, red-tinged cumuli. their movement was disturbing, unlike that of trees
or grass or rabbits. these great masses moved steadily, noiselessly and always in
the same direction. they were not of his world.
     "o frith," thought hazel, turning his head for a moment to the bright glow in
the west, "are you sending us to live among the clouds? if you spoke truly to
fiver, help me to trust him." at this moment he saw dandelion, who had run well
ahead, squatting on an anthill clear against the sky. alarmed, he dashed forward.
     "dandelion, get down!" he said. "why are you sitting up there?"
     "because i can see," replied dandelion, with a kind of excited joy. "come and
look! you can see the whole world."
     hazel came up to him. there was another anthill nearby and he copied
dandelion, sitting upright on his hind legs and looking about him. he realized

they were on top of the down. perched above the grass, they could see far in
every direction. their surroundings were empty. if anything had been moving
they would have seen it immediately: and where the turf ended, the sky began. a
man, a fox -- even a rabbit -- coming over the down would be conspicuous. fiver
had been right. up here, they would have clear warning of any approach.
     the wind ruffled their fur and tugged at the grass, which smelled of thyme and
self-heal. the solitude seemed like a release and a blessing. the height, the sky
and the distance went to their heads and they skipped in the sunset. "o frith on
the hills!" cried dandelion. "he must have made it for us!"
     "he may have made it, but fiver thought of it for us," answered hazel. "wait
till we get him up here! fiver-rah!"

aring about for some time, they ran across to a little mound some
way away and looked again. but they saw nothing except a field mouse, which
came out of its hole and began furricking in a path of seeded grasses.
     "he must have gone down," said dandelion.
     "well, whether he has or not," said hazel, "we can't go on looking for him. the
others are waiting and they may be in danger. we must go down ourselves."
     "what a shame to lose him, though," said dandelion, "just when we'd reached
fiver's hills without losing anyone. he's such a duffer; we shouldn't have brought
him up. but how could anything have got hold of him here, without our seeing?"

     "no, he's gone back, for sure," said hazel. "i wonder what bigwig will say to
him? i hope he won't bite him again. we'd better get on."
     "are you going to bring them up tonight?" asked dandelion.
     "i don't know," said hazel. "it's a problem. where's the shelter to be found?"
     they made for the steep edge. the light was beg

 long way off. people who record birdsong generally do it very early --
before six o'clock -- if they can. soon after that, the invasion of distant noise in
most woodland becomes too constant and too loud. during the last fifty years the
silence of much of the country has been destroyed. but here, on watership down,
there floated up only faint traces of the daylight noise below.
     the sun was well up, though not yet as high as the down, when hazel woke.
with him in the burrow were buckthorn, fiver and pipkin. he was nearest to the
mouth of the hole and did not wake them as he slipped up the run. outside, he
stopped to pass hraka and then hopped through the thorn patch to the open
grass. below, the country was covered with early-morning mist which was
beginning to clear. here and there, far off, were the shapes of trees and roofs,
from which streamers of mist trailed down like broken waves pouring from rocks.
the sky was cloudless and deep blue, darkening to mauve along the whole rim of

horizon. the wind had dropped and the spiders had already gone well down
into the grass. it was going to be a hot day.
     hazel rambled about in the usual way of a rabbit feeding -- five or six slow,
rocking hops through the grass; a pause to look round, sitting up with ears erect;
then busy nibbling for a short time, followed by another move of a few yards. for
the first time for many days he felt relaxed and safe. he began to wonder whether
they had much to learn about their new home.
     "fiver was right," he thought. "this is the place for us. but we shall need to get
used to it and the fewer mistakes we make the better. i wonder what became of
the rabbits who made these holes? did they stop running or did they just move
away? if we could only find them they could tell us a lot."
     at this moment he saw a rabbit come rather hesitantly out of the hole furthest
from himself. it was blackberry. he, too, passed hraka, scratched himself and
then hopped into the full sunlight and combed

     "no, i don't," said hazel. "i've never seen it before."
     "there's a lot we don't know," said blackberry. "about this place, i mean. the

plants are new, the smells are new. we're going to need some new ideas
ourselves."
     "well, you're the fellow for ideas," said hazel. "i never know anything until you
tell me."
     "but you go in front and take the risks first," answered blackberry. "we've all
seen that. and now our journey's over, isn't it? this place is as safe as fiver said it
would be. nothing can get near us without our knowing: that is, as long as we can
smell and see and hear."
     "we can all do that."
     "not when we're asleep: and we can't see in the dark."
     "it's bound to be dark at night," said hazel, "and rabbits have got to sleep."
     "in the open?"
     "well, we can go on using these holes if we want to, but i expect a good many
will lie out. after all, you can't expect a bunch of bucks to dig. they might make a

somewhere else, perhaps; but not here."
     "it'll mean a lot of work."
     "look, there's bigwig come up now and some of the others with him. why not
put it to them and see what they say?"
     during silflay, however, hazel mentioned blackberry's idea to no one but
fiver. later on, when most of the rabbits had finished feeding and were either
playing in the grass or lying in the sunshine, he suggested that they might go
across to the hanger -- "just to see what sort of a wood it is." bigwig and silver
agreed at once and in the end no one stayed behind.
     it was different from the meadow copses they had left: a narrow belt of trees,
four or five hundred yards long but barely fifty wide; a kind of windbreak
common on the downs. it consisted almost entirely of

they could not make out why the wood was so light and still and why they could
see so far between the trees. the continuous, gentle rustling of the beech leaves
was unlike the sounds to be heard in a copse of nut bushes, oak and silver birch.
     moving uncertainly in and out along the edge of the hanger, they came to the
northeast corner. here there was a bank from which they looked out over the
empty stretches of grass beyond. fiver, absurdly small beside the hulking bigwig,
turned to hazel with an air of happy confidence.
     "i'm sure blackberry's right, hazel," he said. "we ought to do our best to make
some holes here. i'm ready to try, anyway."
     the others were taken aback. pipkin, however, readily joined hazel at the foot
of the bank and soon two or three more began scratching at the light soil. the
digging was easy and although they often broke off to feed or merely to sit in the
sun, before midday hazel was out

ed all its movements, until
one evening it left as suddenly as it had come. although he had decided on his
own initiative to arrest bigwig, he had not the reputation of being vindictive. he
was, rather, a stander of no nonsense who knew when duty was done and did it
himself. sound, unassuming, conscientious, a bit lacking in the rabbit sense of
mischief, he was something of the born second-in-command. there could have
been no question of trying to persuade him to leave the warren with hazel and
fiver. to find him under watership down at all, therefore, was astonishing
enough. but to find him in such a condition was all but incredible.
     in the first moments after they had recognized the poor creature under the
hemlock, hazel and dandelion felt completely stupefied, as though they had
come upon a squirrel underground or a stream that flowed uphill. they could not
trust their senses. the voice in the dark had proved not to be supernatural, but
the reality was frightening enough. how could

tion of the hall (which came to be known among them as the
honeycomb) turned out to be something of a triumph for strawberry. hazel
contented himself with organizing the diggers and left it to strawberry to say
what was actually to be done. the work went on in shifts and the rabbits took it in
turns to feed, play and lie in the sun above ground. throughout the day the
solitude remained unbroken by noise, men, tractors, or even cattle, and they

began to feel still more deeply what they owed to fiver's insight. by the late
afternoon the big burrow was beginning to take shape. at the north end, the
beech roots formed a kind of irregular colonnade. this gave way to a more open
central space: and beyond, where there were no supporting roots, strawberry left
blocks of the earth untouched, so that the south end consisted of three or four
separate bays. these narrowed into low-roofed runs that led away into sleeping
burrows.

into the heart of every rabbit that hears it."
     he himself looked so sad and dark as he spoke that no one made any reply, and
after a few moments all six rabbits made their way up the slope in silence. when
they reached the corner of the wood, they found the others feeding or basking in
the evening sun on the north side of the beech trees. after a glance round among
them holly went up to silver, who was feeding with fiver in a patch of yellow
trefoil.
     "i'm glad to see you here, silver," he said. "i hear you've had a rough time."
     "it hasn't been easy," answered silver. "hazel's done wonders and we owe a lot
to fiver here as well."
     "i've heard of you," said holly, turning to fiver. "you're the rabbit who saw it
all coming. you talked to the threarah, didn't you?"
     "he talked to me," said fiver.

was no point in risking lives by following you. if you were gone, you were gone.
but anyone who came back was to be arrested. so then i called off the search.
     "nothing unusual happened the next day. there was a certain amount of talk
about fiver and the rabbits who'd gone with him. everyone knew that fiver had
said that something bad was going to happen and all sorts of rumors started. a lot
of rabbits said there was nothing in it, but some thought that fiver might have
foreseen men with guns and ferrets. that was the worst thing anyone could think
of -- that or the white blindness.
     "willow and i talked things over with the threarah. 'these rabbits,' he said,
'who claim to have the second sight -- i've known one or two in my time.

get it back in a hurry. at the best, you've got a big bunch of hlessil trailing round
in the open, probably with does and kittens tacked on. elil appear in hordes. the
remedy's worse than the disease. almost always, it's better for the warren as a
whole if rabbits sit tight and do their best to dodge their dangers underground.'"
     "of course, i never sat down and thought," said fiver. "it would take the
threarah to think all that out. i simply had the screaming horrors. great golden
frith, i hope i never have them like that again! i shall never forget it -- that and
the night i spent under the yew tree. there's terrible evil in the world."
     "it comes from men," said holly. "all other elil do what they have to do and
frith moves them as he moves us. they live on the earth and they need food. men
will never rest till they've spoiled the earth and destroyed the animals. bu

     "the day before yesterday," said holly, "early in the morning. when i woke it
was still some time before ni-frith. everything was quiet and all i could smell was
rabbit, but i felt at once that something was wrong. i woke bluebell and i was just
going to wake pimpernel when i realized that there was a whole bunch of rabbits
all round us. they were great, big fellows and they had a very odd smell. it was
like -- well, like--"
     "we know what it was like," said fiver.
     "i thought you probably did. then one of them said, 'my name's cowslip. who

are you and what are you doing here?' i didn't like the way he spoke, but i
couldn't see that they had any reason to wish us harm, so i told him that we'd had
a bad time and come a long way and that we were looking for some rabbits from
our warren -- hazel, fiver and bigwig. as soon as i said those names this rabbit
turned to the others and cried, 'i knew it! tear them to pieces!' and they all set on

lollop back to the wood. "let it try keeping the kestrels off for a bit."
     "what's the idea, hazel?" said silver. "that's a savage brute. you can't make a
friend out of that."
     "you may be right," said hazel. "but what's the good of a blue tit or a robin to
us? they don't fly any distance. we need a big bird."
     "but why do you want a bird so particularly?"
     "i'll explain later," said hazel. "i'd like blackberry and fiver to hear as well.
but let's go underground now. if you don't want to chew pellets, i do."
     during the afternoon hazel organized more work on the warren. the
honeycomb was as good as finished -- though rabbits are not methodical and are
never really certain when anything is finished -- and the surrounding burrows

and runs were taking shape. quite early in the evening, however, he made his way
once more to the hollow. the bird was still there. it looked weaker and less alert,

ocilely enough across the grass, but he was careful to keep
out of its reach. their arrival outside the wood caused something of a sensation,
which hazel cut short with a peremptory sharpness quite unlike his usual
manner.
     "come on, get busy," he said to dandelion and buckthorn. "this bird's hurt
and we're going to shelter it until it's better. ask bigwig to show you how to get it
some food. it eats worms and insects. try grasshoppers, spiders -- anything.
hawkbit! acorn! yes, and you too, fiver -- come out of that rapt trance, or
whatever you're in. we need an open, wide hole, broader than it's deep, with a flat
floor a little below the level of the entrance: by nightfall."
     "we've been digging all the afternoon, hazel--"
     "i know. i'll come and help you," said hazel, "in just a little while. only get
started. the night's coming."
     the astonished rabbits obeyed him, grumbling. hazel's authority was put to
something of a test, but held firm with the support of bigwig. altho

spring. it was nothing much, but it held him up. he rested and hung around a
rookery for a bit. then he got stronger and left them, and he was coming along
when he stopped in the farmyard and met this foul cat."
     "so when it's better it'll go on again?" said hazel.
     "yes."
     "we've been wasting our time, then."
     "why, hazel, what is it you have in mind?"
     "go and get blackberry and fiver: we'd better have silver, too. then i'll
explain."
     the quiet of the evening silflay, when the western sun shone straight along the
ridge, the grass tussocks threw shadows twice as long as themselves and the cool
air smelled of thyme and dog roses, was something which they had all come to
enjoy even more than former evenings in the meadows of sandleford. although
they could not know it, the down was more lonely than it had been for hundreds
of years. there were no sheep, and villagers from

h winds from the south laid the grass flat all day, turning it to a dull,
damascene silver. the great branches of the beeches moved little, but spoke
loudly. there were squalls of rain on the wind. the weather made kehaar restless.
he walked about a good deal, watched the flying clouds and snapped up
everything the foragers brought. searching became harder, for in the wet the
insects burrowed into the deep grass and had to be scratched out.
     one afternoon hazel, who now shared a burrow with fiver as in the old days,
was woken by bigwig to be told that kehaar had something to say to him. he
made his way to kehaar's lobby without coming above ground. the first thing he
noticed was that the gull's head was molting and turning white, though a dark

brown patch remained behind each eye. hazel greeted him and was surprised to
be answered in a few words of halting, broken lapine. evidently kehaar had
prepared a short speech.
     "meester 'azel, ees rabbits vork 'ard," said kehaar. "i no fini

ews that kehaar had set out.
     the gull was away several days -- longer than the rabbits had expected. hazel
could not help wondering whether he really would return, for he knew that
kehaar, like themselves, felt the mating urge and he thought it quite likely that
after all he would be off to the big water and the raucous, teeming gull colonies
of which he had spoken with such feeling to bigwig. as far as he was able, he kept
his anxiety to himself, but one day when they were alone, he asked fiver whether
he thought kehaar would return.
     "he will return," said fiver unhesitatingly.
     "and what will he bring with him?"
     "how can i tell?" replied fiver. but later, when they were underground, silent
and drowsy, he said suddenly, "the gifts of el-ahrairah. trickery; great danger;

and blessing for the warren." when hazel questioned him again, he seemed to be
unaware that he had spoken and could add nothing more.

ergeant-major spirit and cuffed and abused him twice
round the honeycomb, until holly intervened to save his faithful jester from
further trouble.
     it was late one afternoon, with a light north wind blowing and the smell of hay
drifting up from the fields of sydmonton, when bigwig came hurtling down into
the honeycomb to announce that kehaar was back. hazel suppressed his
excitement and told everyone to keep out of the way while he went to see him
alone. on second thoughts, however, he took fiver and bigwig with him.
     the three of them found kehaar back in his lobby. it was full of droppings,
messy and malodorous. rabbits will not excrete underground and kehaar's habit
of fouling his own nest had always disgusted hazel. now, in his eagerness to hear
his news, the guano smell seemed almost welcome.
     "glad to see you back, kehaar," he said. "are you tired?"
     "ving 'e still go tired. fly liddle bit, stop liddle bit, everyt'ing go fine."
     "are you hungry? shall we get you so

     "fine. fine. good fellas. plenty beetle." (all insects were "beetle" to kehaar.)
     clearly, he had missed their attentions and was ready to enjoy being back.
although he no longer needed to have food brought to the lobby, he evidently felt
that he deserved it. bigwig went to get his foragers and kehaar kept them busy
until sunset at last he looked shrewdly at fiver and said,
     "eh, meester liddle von, you know vat i pring, ya?"
     "i've no idea," replied fiver, rather shortly.

     he stopped. hazel looked at fiver apprehensively.

     "no, we don't know it. but go on."

     "did you go to the big water, then?" asked bigwig.
     "na, na, not near so far. but out dis vay ees river, you know?"

     "no, we haven't been so far."
     "ees river," repeated kehaar. "und here ees town of rabbits."

     "iron road?" asked fiver.
     "ya, ya, iron road. you not seen heem -- iron road? men make heem."
     kehaar's speech was so outlandish and distorted at the best of times that it was
only too common for the rabbits to be unsure what he meant. the vernacular
words which he used now for "iron" and "road" (familiar enough to seagulls) his
listeners had scarcely ever heard. kehaar was quick to impatience and now, as
often, they felt at a disadvantage in the face of his familiarity with a wider world
than their own. hazel

as long as it would, until at last they dispersed and slept.
     the next morning they went about their lives as usual, feeding kehaar and
themselves, playing and digging. but all this time, just as a drop of water slowly
swells until it is heavy enough to fall from a twig, the idea of what they meant to
do was becoming clear and unanimous. by the following day hazel saw it plain. it
so happened that the time for speaking came when he was sitting on the bank at
sunrise, with fiver and three or four others. there was no need to summon a
general gathering. the thing was settled. when it reached them, those who were
not there would accept what he had said without having heard him at all.
     "this warren that kehaar found," said hazel, "he said it was big."
     "so we can't take it by force," said bigwig.
     "i don't think i want to go and join it," said hazel. "do you?"
     "and leave here?" replied dandelion. "after all our work? besides, i reckon

nd they set out only
when the light was beginning to fade. they took their time and reached the
hanger a little before dark, with nothing worse to trouble them than the
discomfort of soaking-wet fur. only two or three of the rabbits were out to a
rather subdued silflay in the wet. no one remarked on their absence and hazel
went underground at once, telling pipkin to say nothing about their adventure for

the time being. he found his burrow empty, lay down and fell asleep.
     waking, he found fiver beside him as usual. it was some time before dawn.
the earth floor felt pleasantly dry and snug and he was about to go back to sleep
when fiver spoke.
     "you've been wet through, hazel."
     "well, what about it? the grass is wet, you know."
     "you didn't get so wet on silflay. you were soaked. you weren't here at all
yesterday, were you?"
     "oh, i went foraging down the hill."
     "eating swedes: and your feet smell of farmyard -- hens' droppings and bran.

     "well, i had a bit of a brush with a cat, but why worry?"
     "because you're concealing something, hazel. something dangerous."
     "it's holly that's in danger, not i. why bother about me?"
     "holly?" replied fiver in surprise. "but holly and the others reached the big
warren early yesterday evening. kehaar told us. do you mean to say you didn't
know?"
     hazel felt fairly caught out. "well, i know now," he replied. "i'm glad to hear
it."
     "so it comes to this," said fiver. "you went to a farm yesterday and escaped
from a cat. and whatever you were up to, it was so much on your mind that you
forgot to ask about holly last night."
     "well, all right, fiver -- i'll tell you all about it. i took pip

t, to come and join us here."
     "what for?"
     "well, two of them are does, that's what for."
     "but if holly's successful we shall soon have plenty of does: and from all i've
ever heard of hutch rabbits, they don't take easily to wild life. the truth is, you're
just a silly show-off."
     "a silly show-off?" said hazel. "well, we'll just see whether bigwig and
blackberry think so."
     "risking your life and other rabbits' lives for something that's of little or no
value to us," said fiver. "oh, yes, of course the others will go with you. you're
their chief rabbit. you're supposed to decide what's sensible and they trust you.
persuading them will prove nothing, but three or four dead rabbits will prove
you're a fool, when it's too late."
     "oh, be quiet," answered hazel. "i'm going to sleep."
     during silflay next morning, with pipkin for a respectful chorus, he told the
others about his visit to the farm. as he had expected, bigwig jumped at the idea
of a raid to free the

whole world to be covered with rain. but a man built a great floating hutch that
held all the animals and birds until frith returned and let them out.
     "it won't happen tonight, will it, hazel-rah?" asked pipkin, listening to the rain
in the beech leaves outside. "there's no hutch here."
     "kehaar'll fly you up to the moon, hlao-roo," said bluebell, "and you can come
down on bigwig's head like a birch branch in the frost. but there's time to go to
sleep first."
     before fiver slept, however, he talked again to hazel about the raid.
     "i suppose it's no good asking you not to go?" he said.
     "look here," answered hazel, "have you got one of your bad turns about the
farm? if you have, why not say so straight out? then we'd all know where we
were."
     "i've no feelings about the farm one way or the other," said fiver. "but that
doesn't necessarily mean it's all right. the feelings come when they will -- they
don't always come. not for the lendri, not for the cr

ow. if it comes to that, i've no
idea what's happening to holly and the others. it might be good or bad. but
there's something that frightens me about you yourself, hazel: just you, not any
of the others. you're all alone, sharp and clear, like a dead branch against the
sky."
     "well, if you mean you can see trouble for me and not for any of the others, tell
them and i'll leave it to them to decide whether i ought to keep out of it. but
that's giving up a lot, fiver, you know. even with your word for it, someone's
bound to think i'm afraid."
     "well, i say it's not worth the risk, hazel. why not wait for holly to come back?
that's all we have to do."

     "i'll be snared if i wait for holly. can't you see that the very thing i want is to
have these does here when he comes back? but look, fiver, i'll tell you what. i've
come to trust you so much that i'll take the greatest care. in fact, i won't even go
into the farmyard myself. i'll stay outside, at t

meeting your fears halfway, then i don't know what is."
     fiver said no more and hazel turned his thoughts to the raid and the difficulty
he foresaw of getting the hutch rabbits to go the distance back to the warren.
     the next day was bright and dry, with a fresh wind that cleared up what
remained of the wet. the clouds came racing over the ridge from the south as they
had on the may evening when hazel first climbed the down. but now they were
higher and smaller, settling at last into a mackerel sky like a beach at low tide.

erry to the edge of the escarpment, whence they
could look across to nuthanger on its little hill. he described the approach and
went on to explain how the rabbit hutch was to be found. bigwig was in high
spirits. the wind and the prospect of action excited him and he spent some time
with dandelion, hawkbit and speedwell, pretending to be a cat and encouraging
them to attack him as realistically as they could. hazel, whose talk with fiver had
somewhat clouded him, recovered as he watched them tussling over the grass and
ended by joining in himself, first as an attacker and then as the cat, staring and
quivering for all the world like the nuthanger tabby.
     "i shall be disappointed if we don't meet a cat after all this," said dandelion, as
he waited for his turn to run at a fallen beech branch from one side, claw it twice
and dash out again. "i feel a really dangerous animal."
     "you vatch heem, meester dando," said kehaar,

hazel, "it'll probably take these rabbits a long time to
get to the down. we shall have to be patient with them. i'd rather do that in
darkness, elil or no elil. we don't want to be messing about in broad daylight."
     "if it comes to the worst," said bigwig, "we can leave the hutch rabbits and bolt.
elil take the hindmost, don't they? i know it's tough, but if there's real trouble we
ought to save our own rabbits first. let's hope that doesn't happen, though."
     when they came to set out, fiver was nowhere to be seen. hazel felt relieved,
for he had been afraid that fiver might say something that would lower their

spirits. but there was nothing worse to contend with than pipkin's
disappointment at being left behind; and this was dispelled when hazel assured
him that the only reason was that he had already done his bit. bluebell, acorn and
pipkin came with them to the foot of the hill and watched them down the
hedgerow.
     they reached the sheds in the twilight after sunset the sum

quite gone.
     rabbits do not name the stars, but nevertheless hazel was familiar with the
sight of capella rising; and he watched it now until it stood gold and bright in the
dark northeastern horizon to the right of the farm. when it reached a certain
point which he had fixed, beside a bare branch, he roused the others and led them
up the slope toward the elms. near the top he slipped through the hedge and
brought them down into the lane.
     hazel had already told bigwig of his promise to fiver to keep out of danger;
and bigwig, who had changed much since the early days, had no fault to find.
     "if that's what fiver says, you'd better do it, hazel," he said. "anyhow it'll suit
us. you stay outside the farm in a safe place and we'll bring the rabbits out to you:
then you can take over and get us all away." what hazel had not said was that the
idea that he should remain in the lane was his own suggestion, and that fiver had
acquiesced only because he could not persuade him to give up

usly back up

the lane. they found the bottom of the ditch trampled by boots and streaked with
blood, and returned to tell the others.
     the journey back, with the three limping hutch rabbits, lasted more than two
weary hours. all were dejected and wretched. when at last they reached the foot
of the down bigwig told blackberry, speedwell and hawkbit to leave them and go
on to the warren. they approached the wood just at first light and a rabbit ran to
meet them through the wet grass. it was fiver. blackberry stopped and waited
beside him while the other two went on in silence.
     "fiver," he said, "there's bad news. hazel--"
     "i know," replied fiver. "i know now."
     "how do you know?" asked blackberry, startled.
     "as you came through the grass just now," said fiver, very low, "there was a
fourth rabbit behind you, limping and covered with blood. i ran to see who it was,
and then there were only three of you, side by side."
     he paused and looked across the down, as thoug

h still seeking the bleeding
rabbit who had vanished in the half-light. then, as blackberry said nothing more,
he asked, "do you know what happened?"
     when blackberry had told his news, fiver returned to the warren and went
underground to his empty burrow. a little later bigwig brought the hutch rabbits
up the hill and at once called everyone to meet in the honeycomb. fiver did not
appear.
     it was a dismal welcome for the strangers. not even bluebell could find a
cheerful word. dandelion was inconsolable to think that he might have stopped
hazel breaking from the ditch. the meeting came to an end in a dreary silence
and a half-hearted silflay.
     later that morning holly came limping into the warren. of his three
companions, only silver was alert and unharmed. buckthorn was wounded in the
face and strawberry was shivering and evidently ill from exhaustion. t

26.     fiver beyond

     on his dreadful journey, after the shaman has wandered through dark forests
and over great ranges of mountains,... he reaches an opening in the ground. the
most difficult stage of the adventure now begins. the depths of the underworld
open before him.
          uno harva, quoted by joseph campbell in the hero with a thousand
faces

     fiver lay on the earth floor of the burrow. outside, the downs were still in the
intense, bright heat of noon. the dew and gossamer had dried early from the
grass and by midmorning the finches had fallen silent. now, along the lonely
expanses of wiry turf, the air wavered. on the footpath that led past the warren,
bright threads of light -- watery, a mirage -- trickled and glittered across the
shortest, smoothest grass. from a distance the trees along the edge of the beech
hanger appeared full of gre

the only sound was the "zip, zip" of the grasshoppers, the only scent that of the
warm thyme.
     in the burrow, fiver slept and woke uneasily through the heat of the day,
fidgeting and scratching as the last traces of moisture dried out of the earth above
him. once, when a trickle of powdery soil fell from the roof, he leaped out of sleep
and was in the mouth of the run before he came to himself and returned to where
he had been lying. each time he woke, he remembered the loss of hazel and
suffered once more the knowledge that had pierced him as the shadowy, limping
rabbit disappeared in the first light of mor

ning on the down. where was that
rabbit now? where had it gone? he began to follow it among the tangled paths of
his own thoughts, over the cold, dew-wet ridge and down into the dawn mist of
the fields below.
     the mist swirled round fiver as he crept through thistles and nettles. now he
could no longer see the limping rabbit ahead. he was alone and afraid, yet
perceiving old, familiar sounds and smells -- those of the field where he was born.
the thick weeds of summer were gone. he was under the bare ash boughs and the
flowering blackthorn of march. he was crossing the brook, going up the slope
toward the lane, toward the place where hazel and he had come upon the notice
board. would the board still be there? he looked timidly u

p the slope. the view
was blotted with mist, but as he neared the top he saw a man busy over a pile of
tools -- a spade, a rope and other, smaller implements, the use of which he did
not know. the notice board lay flat on the ground. it was smaller than he
remembered and fixed to a single, long, square post, sharpened at the further end
to put into the earth. the surface of the board was white, just as he had seen it
before, and covered with the sharp black lines like sticks. fiver came hesitantly
up the slope and stopped close to the man, who stood looking down into a deep,
narrow hole sunk in the ground at his feet. the man turned to fiver with the kind
of amiability that an ogre might show to a victim whom they both know that he
will kill and eat as soon as it suits him to do so.
     "ah! an' what am i doin', eh?" asked the man.
     "what are you doing?" answered fiver, staring and twitching with fear.
     "i'm just putt'n up this 'ere ol' board," said the man. "and

that's why we kills you when we 'as a mind to. now, you wants take a good look
at that there board and then very likely you'll know more 'n what you knows

     in the livid, foggy twilight, fiver stared at the board. as he stared, the black
sticks flickered on the white surface. they raised their sharp, wedge-shaped little
heads and chattered together like a nestful o

to call again. then the man bent down and hit him between the ears.
     fiver was struggling in a thick cloud of earth, soft and powdery. someone was
saying, "steady, fiver, steady!" he sat up. there was soil in his eyes, his ears and
nostrils. he could not smell. he shook himself and said, "who is it?"
     "it's blackberry. i came to see how you were. it's all right; a bit of the roof's
fallen, that's all. there've been falls all over the warren today -- it's the heat.
anyway, it woke you from a nightmare, if i know anything. you were thrashing
about and calling out for hazel. you poor old chap! what a miserable thing it is to
have happened! we must try to bear

it as best we can. we've all got to stop
running one day, you know. they say frith knows all the rabbits, every one."
     "is it evening?" asked fiver.
     "not yet, no. but it's a fair time after ni-frith. holly and the others have come
back, you know. strawberry's very ill and they haven't any does with them -- not
one. everything's as bad as it could be. holly's still asleep -- he was completely
exhausted. he said he'd tell us what happened this evening. when we told him
about poor hazel, he said -- fiver, you're not listening. i expect you'd rather i
kept quiet."
     "blackberry," said fiver, "do you know the place where hazel was shot?

"
     "yes, bigwig and i went and looked at the ditch before we came away. but you
mustn't--"
     "could you go there with me now?"
     "go back there? oh, no. it's a long way, fiver, and what would be the good?
the risk, and this fearful heat, and you'd only make yourself wretched."
     "hazel isn't dead," said fiver.
     "yes, the men took him away. fiver, i saw the blood."
     "yes, but you didn't see hazel, because he isn't dead. blackberry, you must do
what i ask."
     "you're asking too much."
     "then i shall have to go alone. but what i'm asking you to do is to come and
save hazel's life."
     when at last blackberry had reluctantly given in and they had set out down the
hill, fiver went almost as fast as though he were running for cover. again and
again he urged blackberry to make haste. the fields were empty in the glare.

ture bigger than a bluebottle was sheltering from the heat. when they
reached the outlying sheds beside the lane, blackberry began to explain how he
and bigwig had gone back to search; but fiver cut him short.
     "we have to go up the slope, i know that: but you must show me the ditch."

     the elms were still. there was not the least sound in the leaves. the ditch was
thick with cow parsley, hemlock and long trails of green-flowering bryony.
blackberry led the way to the trampled patch of nettles and fiver sat still among
them, sniffing and looking about him in the silence. blackberry watched him
disconsolately. a faint breath of wind stole across the fields and a blackbird began

to sing from somewhere beyond the elms. at last fiver began to move along the
bottom of the ditch. the insects buzzed round his ears and suddenly a little cloud
of flies flew up, disturbed from a projecting stone. no, not a stone. it was smooth
and regular -- a circular lip of earthenware. the brown mouth of a drain, stained
black at the lower edge by a thin, dried thread of blood: of rabbit's blood.
     "the bloody hole!" whispered fiver. "the bloody hole!"
     he peered into the dark opening. it was blocked. blocked by a rabbit. that was
plain to be smelled. a rabbit whose faint pulse could just be heard, magnified in
the confined tunnel.
     "hazel?" said fiver.
     blackberry was beside him at once. "what is it, fiver?"
     "hazel's in that hole," said fiver, "and he's alive."

 and how were these does to
make themselves at home in strange conditions and a place where everyone was
lost so poorly in his thoughts? they would die, perhaps, or wander away. he

buckled once more to the task of explaining that he was sure better times lay
ahead -- and as he did so, felt himself the least convinced of any.
     bigwig had sent acorn to see whether there was anyone still to come. acorn
returned to say that strawberry felt too ill and that he could find neither
blackberry nor fiver.
     "well, leave fiver," said bigwig. "poor fellow, he'll feel better by himself for a
time, i dare say."
     "he's not in his burrow, though," said acorn.
     "never mind," said bigwig. but the thought came to him, "fiver and
blackberry? could they have left the warren without telling anyone? if they have,
what will happen when the others get to know?" should he ask kehaar to go and
look for them while there was still light? but if kehaar found them, what then?
they could not be compelled

topped continually to sit up and sniff about
him at the peaceful, empty down. when he noticed bigwig, a little way off, staring
fixedly to the north, he at once followed his gaze.

     "what is it?" he asked.
     "it's blackberry," replied bigwig. he sounded relieved.
     blackberry came hopping rather slowly down from the skyline. he looked tired
out, but as soon as he saw the other rabbits he came on faster and made his way
to bigwig.
     "where have you been?" asked bigwig. "and where's fiver? wasn't he with
you?"
     "fiver's with hazel," said blackberry. "hazel's alive. he's been wounded -- it's
hard to tell how badly -- but he won't die."
     the other three rabbits looked at him speechlessly. blackberry waited,
enjoying the effect.
     "hazel's alive?" said bigwig. "are you sure?"
     "quite sure," said blackberry. "he's at the foot of the hill at this very moment,
in that ditch where you were the night holly and bluebell arrived."
     "i can hardly believe it," said holly.
 
 ___________________________
 
 "if it's true, it's the best news i've ever
heard in my life. blackberry, you really are sure? what happened? tell us."
     "fiver found him," said blackberry. "fiver took me with him, nearly all the way
back to the farm: then he went along the ditch and found hazel gone to ground
up a land drain. he was very weak from loss of blood and he couldn't get out of
the drain by himself. we had to drag him by his good hind leg. he couldn't turn
round, you see."
     "but how on earth did fiver know?"
     "how does fiver know what he knows? you'd better ask him. when we'd got
hazel into the ditch, fiver looked to see how badly he was hurt. he's got a nasty
wound in one hind leg, but the bone isn't broken: and he's torn all along one side.
we cleaned up the places as well as we could and then we started out to bring him
back. it's taken us the whole evening. can you imagine it -- daylight, dead silence
and a lame rabbit reeking of fresh blood? luckily, it's been the hottest day we've

had this summer -- not a mouse stirring. time and again we had to take cover in
the cow parsley and rest. i was all on the jump, but fiver was like a butterfly on a
stone. he sat in the grass and combed his ears. 'don't get upset,' he kept saying.
'there's nothing to worry about. we can take our time.' after what i'd seen, i'd
have believed him if he'd said we could hunt foxes. but when we got to the bottom
of the hill hazel was completely finished and he couldn't go any further. he and
fiver have taken shelter in the overgrown ditch and i came on to tell you. and
here i am."
     there was silence while bigwig and holly took in the news. at last bigwig said,
"will they stay there tonight?"
     "i think so," replied blackberry. "i'm sure hazel won't be able to manage the
hill until he's a good deal stronger."
     "i'll go down there," said bigwig. "i can help to make the ditch a bit more
comfortable, and probably fiver will be able to do with someone else to help to

soon."
     "hah!" said bigwig, "if i meet a stoat, it'd better look out, that's all. i'll bring
you one back tomorrow, shall i?" he raced off and disappeared over the edge.

     "let's go and get the others together," said holly. "come on, blackberry, you'll
have to tell the whole thing, from the beginning."
     the three quarters of a mile in the blazing heat, from nuthanger to the foot of
the hill, had cost hazel more pain and effort than anything in his life. if fiver had
not found him, he would have died in the drain. when fiver's urging had
penetrated his dark, ebbing stupor, he had at first actually tried not to respond. it
was so much easier to remain where he was, on the far side of the suffering he
had undergone. later, when he found himself lying in the green gloom of the
ditch, with fiver searching his wounds and assuring him that he could stand and
move, still he could not face the idea of setting out to return. his torn side
throbbed and the pain i

n his leg seemed to have affected his senses. he felt dizzy
and could not hear or smell properly. at last, when he understood that fiver and
blackberry had risked a second journey to the farm, in the broadest of daylight,
solely to find him and save his life, he forced himself to his feet and began to
stumble down the slope to the road. his sight was swimming and he had to stop
again and again. without fiver's encouragement he would have lain down once
more and given up. in the road, he could not climb the bank and had to limp
along the verge until he could crawl under a gate. much later, as they came under
the pylon line, he remembered the overgrown ditch at the foot of the hill and set
himself to reach it. once there, he lay down and at once returned to the sleep of
total exhaustion.
     when bigwig arrived, just before dark, he found fiver snatching a quick feed
in the long grass. it was out of

gvig, you find meester 'azel?"
     "yes," said bigwig, "he's in the ditch here."
     "'e not dead?"
     "no, but he's wounded and very weak. the farm man shot him with a gun, you
know."
     "you get black stones out?"
     "how do you mean?"
     "alvays vid gun ees coming liddle black stones. you never see?"
     "no, i don't know about guns."
     "take out black stones, 'e get better. 'e come now, ya?"
     "i'll see," said bigwig. he went down to hazel and found him awake and
talking to fiver. when bigwig told him that kehaar was outside he dragged
himself up the short run and into the grass.
     "dis damn gun," said kehaar. "'e put liddle stones for 'urt you. i look, ya?"
     "i suppose you'd better," said hazel. "my leg's still very bad, i'm afraid."
     he lay down and kehaar's head flicked from side to side as though he were
looking for snails in hazel's brown fur. he peered closely up the length of the torn
flank.
     "ees not stones 'ere," he said. "go in, go out -- no sto

     as things turned out, hazel stayed three days at the foot of the hill. the hot
weather continued and for much of the time he sat under the elder branches,
dozing above ground like some solitary hlessi and feeling his strength returning.
fiver stayed with him, keeping the wounds clean and watching his recovery.
often they would say nothing for hours together, lying in the rough, warm grass
while the shadows moved to evening, until at last the local blackbird cocked its
tail and tuck-tucked away to roost. neither spoke of nuthanger farm, but hazel
showed plainly enough that for the future fiver, when he gave advice, would have
no hard task to get him to accept it.
     "hrairoo," said hazel one evening, "what would we have done withou

t you?
we'd none of us be here, would we?"
     "you're sure we are here, then?" asked fiver.
     "that's too mysterious for me," replied hazel. "what do you mean?"
     "well, there's another place -- another country, isn't there? we go there when
we sleep; at other times, too; and when we die. el-ahrairah comes and goes
between the two as he wants, i suppose, but i could never quite make that out,
from the tales. some rabbits will tell you it's all easy there, compared with the
waking dangers that they understand. but i think that only shows they don't

he's dead. they'd got him, all right -- the ones in that country. they don't give
their secrets away for nothing, you know. but look! here come holly and
blackberry, so we'd better feel sure we're here just for the moment, anyway."
     holly had already come down the hill on the previous day to see hazel and tell
again the story of his escape from efrafa. when he had spoken of his deliverance
by the great apparition in the night, fiver had listened attentively and asked one
question, "did it make a noise?" later, when holly had gone back, he told hazel
that he felt sure there was some natural explanation, though he had no idea what
it could be. hazel, however, had not been greatly interested. for him, the
important thing was their disappointment and the reason for it. holly had
achieved nothing and this was entirely due to the unexpected unfriendliness of
the efrafan rabbits. this evening, as soon as they had begun to feed, h

mmed around the dense white cymes hanging low above the grass. a
pair of brown-and-orange beetles, disturbed by the feeding rabbits, took off from
a grass stem and flew away, still coupled together.
     "they mate. we don't," said hazel, watching them go. "a trick, blackberry: a
trick to put us right once and for all."
     "i can see how to do the first thing," said blackberry. "at least, i think i can.
but it's dangerous. the other two i can't see at all yet and i'd like to talk it over
with fiver."
     "the sooner fiver and i get back to the warren the better," said hazel. "my
leg's good enough now, but all the same i think we'll leave it for tonight. good old
holly, will you tell them that fiver and i will come early tomorrow morning? it
worries me to think that bigwig and silver may start fighting about clover at any
moment."
     "hazel," said holly, "listen. i don't like this idea of yours at all. i've been in
efrafa and you haven't. you're making a bad mistake and you might very w

     it was fiver who replied. "it ought to feel like that, i know," he said, "but
somehow it doesn't: not to me. i believe we can do it. anyway, i'm sure hazel's
right when he says it's the only chance we've got. suppose we go on talking about
it for a bit?"
     "not now," said hazel. "time for underground down here -- come on. but if
you two race up the hill, you'll probably be in time for some more sunshine at the
top. good night."

     the following morning all the rabbits were out at silflay by dawn and there was
a good deal of excitement as they waited for hazel. during the previous few days
blackberry had had to repeat several times the story of the journey to the farm
and the finding of hazel in the drain. one or two had suggested that kehaar must
have found hazel and told fiver secretly. but kehaar denied this and, when

pressed, replied cryptically that fiver was one who had traveled a good deal
further than he had himself. as for hazel, he had acquired, in everyone's eyes, a
kind of magical quality. of all the warren, dandelion was the last rabbit to fail to
do justice to a good story and he had made the most of hazel's heroic dash out of
the ditch to save his friends from the farmers. no one had even suggested that
hazel might have been reckless in going to the fa

rm. against all odds he had got
them two does: and now he was bringing their luck back to the warren.
     just before sunrise pipkin and speedwell saw fiver coming through the wet
grass near the summit of the down. they ran out to meet him and waited with
him until hazel came up to them. hazel was limping and had evidently found the
climb a strain, but after resting and feeding for a short time he was able to run
down to the warren almost as fast as the others. the rabbits crowded round.

     "would we have to go into efrafa?" asked pipkin timidly.
     "no," said hazel, "we shall--"
     "i never thought, hazel," interrupted holly, "i never thought that the time
would come when i should feel obliged to speak against you. but i can only say
again that this is likely to be a complete disaster. i know what you think -- you're
counting on general woundwort not having anyone as clever as blackberry and
fiver. you're quite right -- i don't think he has. but the fact remains that no one
can get a bunch of does away from that place. you all know that i've spent my life
patrolling and tracking in the open. well, there are rabbits in the efrafan owsla

other! i know you want only to help us all, but do be sensible and give this

make the best of things as they are, or we can put them right once and
for all. of course there's a risk: anyone knows that who's heard what happened to
holly and the others. but haven't we faced one risk after another, all the way from
the warren we left? what do you mean to do? stay here and scratch each other's
eyes out over two does, when there are plenty in efrafa that you're afraid to go
and get, even though they'd be only too glad to come and join us?"
     someone called out, "what does fiver think?"

     "i'm certainly going," said fiver quietly. "hazel's perfectly right and there's
nothing the matter with his plan. but i promise you this, all of you. if i do come,
later on, to feel any kind of misgiving, i shan't keep it to myself."
     "and if that happens, i shan't ignore it," said hazel.
     there was silence. then bigwig spoke.
     "you may as well all know that i'm going," he said, "and we shall have kehaar
with us, if that appeals to you at all."
     there was a buzz o

r longing and
need to find more does and the knowledge that there were plenty of does in
efrafa. then there was their sense of mischief. all rabbits love to trespass and
steal and when it comes to the point very few will admit that they are afraid to do
so; unless (like buckthorn or strawberry on this occasion) they know that they
are not fit and that their bodies may let them down in the pinch. again, in
speaking about his secret plan, hazel had aroused their curiosity. he had hoped
that, with fiver behind him, he could lure them with hints and promises: and he
had been right. the rabbits trusted him and fiver, who had gotten them out of
sandleford before it was too late, crossed the enborne and the common, taken
bigwig out of the wire, founded the warren on the downs, made an ally of kehaar
and produced two does against all odds. there was no telling what they would do
next. but they were evidently up to something; and since bigwig and blackberry
seemed to be confidently in on it, no one

ce were
numerous and so were the kestrels. the kestrels were disturbing, but hazel had
been right when he guessed that a healthy, full-grown rabbit was too large a
quarry for them. at all events, no one was attacked from above.
     some time before ni-frith, in the heat of the day, silver paused in a little patch
of thorn. there was no breeze and the air was full of the sweet, chrysanthemum-
like smell of the flowering compositae of dry uplands -- corn chamomile, yarrow
and tansy. as hazel and fiver came up and squatted beside him, he looked out
across the open ground ahead.
     "there, hazel-rah," he said, "that's the wood that holly didn't like."
     two or three hundred yards away and directly across their line, a belt of trees
ran straight across the down, stretching in each direction as far as they could see.
they had come to the line of the portway -- only intermittently a road -- which
runs from north of andover, through st. mary bourne with its bells and streams
and watercress be

 woodland as
straight as the road, narrow indeed but more than three miles long. in this hot
noonday the trees of the belt were looped and netted with darkest shadow. the
sun lay outside, the shadows inside the trees. all was still, save for the
grasshoppers and the falling finch song of the yellowhammer on the thorn. hazel
looked steadily for a long time, listening with raised ears and wrinkling his nose
in the unmoving air.
     "i can't see anything wrong with it," he said at last. "can you, fiver?"
     "no," replied fiver. "holly thought it was a strange kind of wood and so it is,
but there don't seem to be any men there. all the same, someone ought to go and
make sure, i suppose. shall i?"
     the third group had come up while hazel had been gazing at the belt, and now
all the rabbits were either nibbling quietly or resting, with ears laid flat, in the
light green sun-and-shade of the thorn thicket
     "is bigwig there?" asked hazel.
     throughout the morning bigwig had seemed unl

ike himself -- silent and
preoccupied, with little attention for what was going on around him. if his
courage had not been beyond question, it might have been thought that he was
feeling nervous. during one long halt bluebell had overheard him talking with
hazel, fiver and blackberry, and later had told pipkin that it sounded for all the
world as though bigwig were being reassured. "fighting, yes, anywhere," he had
heard him say, "but i still reckon that this game is more in someone else's line
than mine." "no," replied hazel, "you're the only one that can do it: and
remember, this isn't sport, if the farm raid was. everything depends on it." then,
realizing that bluebell could hear him, he added, "anyway, keep on thinking

about it and try to get used to th

     less than half a mile to the west, they came upon a spinney adjoining the
southern edge of caesar's belt. to the west again was a shallow, dry downland
combe, perhaps four hundred yards across and overgrown with weeds and rough,
yellowing summer tussocks. there, well before sunset, kehaar, flying westward
down the belt, spotted the rabbits lying up, all among the nettles and goose grass.
he sailed down and alighted near hazel and fiver.
     "how's holly?" asked hazel.
     "'e sad," said kehaar. "'e say you no come back." then he added, "mees clover,
she ready for mudder."
     "that's good," said hazel. "is anyone doing anything about it?"
     "ya, ya, ees all to fight."
     "oh, well, i suppose it'll sort itself out."
     "vat you do now, meester 'azel?"

     "and you think that's the best we can do?"

     "what do you think?" said hazel to fiver.
     "it sounds better than i'd hoped for," said fiver. "i hate to say it, but i think we
ought to go straight there as fast as we can, even if it makes everyone exhausted.
we're in danger all the time we're on the down, but once we get off it we can rest."
     "well, i suppose we'd better go on by night, if they'll do it -- we've done it

edge, and after parrying one or two
questions about the plan, he began to wonder how he could distract their
thoughts and get them to relax until they were ready to set off again. he
remembered the time, on the first night of his leadership, when they had been
forced to rest in the wood above the enborne. at least it was good to see that no
one was exhausted now: they were as tough a bunch of hlessil as ever raided a
garden. not a blade of grass to choose between them, thought hazel: pipkin and
fiver looked as fresh as silver and bigwig. still, a little entertainment would be all
to the good and raise their spirits. he was just going to speak up when acorn
saved him the trouble.
     "will you tell us a story, dandelion?" he asked.
     "yes! yes!" said several others. "come on! make it a stunner while you're at it!"
     "all right," said dandelion. "how about 'el-ahrairah and the fox in the
water'?"
     "let's have 'the hole in the sky,'" said hawkbit.
     "no, not that," said bigwig su

huge rabbit hole. in the freezing cold and silence, el-ahrairah stamped and
flashed his tail to rabscuttle. and then, as they were about to go into the tunnel,
they realized that what they had thought, in the gloom, to be a part of the rock
was not rock. it was the black rabbit of inlé, close beside them, still as lichen and
cold as the stone."
     "hazel," said pipkin, staring into the dusk and trembling, "i don't like this
story. i know i'm not brave--"
     "it's all right, hlao-roo," said fiver, "you're not the only one." in fact he
himself seemed composed and even detached, which was more than could be said
for any other rabbit in the audience: but pipkin was hardly to realize this. "let's
go out there for a bit and watch the spiders catching moths, shall we?" said fiver.
"i think i can remember where i left a patch of vetch -- it must be somewhere this
way." still talking quietly, he led pipkin out into the overgrown combe. hazel
turned to make sure of the direction they had taken a

its who had been listening to dandelion's
story had ever seen a fox. nevertheless, they knew that a fox in the open, plain to
be seen, is not dangerous as long as it is spotted in time. hazel realized that he

had been careless to allow everyone to gather round dandelion and to have failed
to post even one sentry. what wind there was was from the northeast and the fox,
coming up the combe from the west, might have broken in upon them without
warning. but from this danger they had been saved by fiver and pipkin going into
the open. even in his flash of alarm as pipkin spoke, it crossed hazel's mind that
fiver, no doubt reluctant to advise him in front of the others, had probably seized
the opportunity provided by pipkin's fear to post himself as a sentry.
     hazel thought quickly. if the fox were not too close, all they had to do was run.
there was woodland nearby and they could vanish into it, keeping more or less
together, and simply continue on their way. he pushed through the burdocks

.
     "how close is it?" he asked. "and where's fiver?"
     "i'm here," replied fiver, from a few yards away. he was squatting under the
long briars of a dog rose and did not turn his head as hazel came up beside him.
"and there's the fox," he added. hazel followed his gaze.
     the rough, weed-covered ground of the combe sloped away below them, a long
dip bounded on the north by caesar's belt. the last of the setting sun shone
straight up it through a break in the trees. the fox was below them and still some
way off. although it was almost directly downwind and therefore must

smell them, it did not look as though it were particularly interested in rabbits. it
was trotting steadily up the combe like a dog, trailing its white-tipped brush. in
color it was sandy brown, with dark legs and ears. even now, though obviously
not hunting, it had a crafty, predatory look that made the watchers among the
dog roses shiver. as it passed behind a patch of thistles and disappeared from
view, hazel and fiver returned to the others.
     "come on," said hazel. "if you've never seen a fox, don't bother to go and look
now. just follow me."
     he was about to lead the way up the south side of the combe when suddenly a
rabbit shouldered him roughly aside, pushed past fiver and was gone into the
open. hazel stopped and looked round in amazement.
     "who was that?" he asked.
     "bigwig," answered fiver, staring.
     together they went quickly back to the briars and once more looked into the
combe.

lver from behind, "shall i--?"
     "no one is to move," said hazel quickly. "keep still, all of you."
     at about thirty yards' distance the fox saw the approaching rabbit. it paused
for a moment and then continued to trot forward. it was almost upon him before
bigwig turned and began to limp up the north slope of the combe toward the trees
of the belt. the fox hesitated again and then followed him.
     "what's he up to?" muttered blackberry.
     "trying to draw it off, i suppose," replied fiver.
     "but he didn't have to! we should have got away without that."
     "confounded fool!" said hazel. "i don't know when i've been so angry."
     the fox had quickened its pace and was now some distance away from them. it
appeared to be overtaking bigwig. the sun had set and in the failing light they
could just make him out as he entered the undergrowth. he disappeared and the

fox followed. for several moments all was quiet. then, horribly clear across the

him, the rabbits fidgeted nervously. several had begun to feel a dreamlike sense
of unreality. the long day above ground, the close, overgrown combe, the
frightening story in which they had been absorbed, the sudden appearance of the
fox, the shock of bigwig's inexplicable adventure -- all these, following one upon
another, had flooded their spirits and left them dull and bemused.
     "get them out, hazel," whispered fiver, "before they all go tharn."
     hazel turned at once. "well, no fox," he said cheerfully. "it's gone and we'll go,
too. for goodness' sake keep close together, because if anyone gets lost in the
dark we may not find him again. and remember, if we come upon any strange
rabbits, you're to attack them at once and ask questions afterward."
     they skirted the side of the wood that lay along the southern edge of the combe

     "oh, curse these confounded patrols!" cried hazel. "come on, all of you, get
down the field into that wood! yes, you, too, speedwell, unless you want to have
your ears chewed off in efrafa. come on, move!"
     they tottered over the pasture to the woodland beyond and lay completely
exhausted on flat, bare ground under fir trees. hazel and fiver consulted kehaar
again.
     "it's no good expecting them to go any further, kehaar," said hazel. "they've
been going all night, you know. we'll have to sleep here today. did you actually
see a patrol?"
     "ya, ya, come all along by udder side iron road. yoost in time you go."
     "well, then, you saved us. but look, kehaar, could you go and see where they

the noise of a crowd, can form an idea of its size. the sound of the river told the
rabbits that it must be bigger than any they had known before -- wide, smooth
and swift. pausing among the comfrey and ground elder, they stared at each
other, seeking reassurance. then they began to lollop hesitantly forward into
more open ground. there was still no river to be seen, but in front they could
perceive a flicker and dance of mirrored light in the air. soon afterward hazel,
limping ahead with fiver near him, found himself on a narrow green path that
divided the wilderness from the riverbank.
     the path was almost as smooth as a lawn and clear of bushes and weeds, for it
was kept cut for fishermen. along its further side the riparian plants grew thickly,
so that it was separated from the river by a kind of hedge of purple loosestrife,
great willow herb, fleabane, figwort and hemp agrimony, here and there already
in bloom. two or three more of the rabbits emerged from the wood. peering

hedge, the sound of a fairly heavy splash: but what creature
might have made it there was no telling.
     looking round for hazel, pipkin caught sight of kehaar, a little way off,
standing in a patch of shallow water between two clumps of willow herb. he was
stabbing and snapping at something in the mud and after a few moments pulled
out a six-inch leech and swallowed it whole. beyond him, some distance down the
path, hazel was combing the goose grass out of his coat and evidently listening to
fiver as they sat together under a rhododendron. pipkin ran along the bank and
joined them.
     "there's nothing wrong with the place," fiver was saying. "there's no more
danger here than anywhere else. kehaar's going to show us where to get across,
isn't he? the thing to do is to get on with it before it gets dark."
     "they'll never stop here," replied hazel. "we can't stay and wait for bigwig in a
place like this. it's unnatural for rabbits."
     "yes, we can -- calm down. they'll get used to

you, it's better than one or two other places we've been in. not all strange things
are bad. would you like me to take them over? say it's because of your leg."
     "fine," said hazel. "hlao-roo, can you get everyone along here?"
     when pipkin had gone, he said, "i feel troubled, fiver. i'm asking so much of
them, and there are so many risks in this plan."
     "they're a better lot than you give them credit for," replied fiver. "if you were
to--"
     kehaar called raucously across, startling a wren out of the bushes.
     "meester 'azel, vat for you vait?"
     "to know where to go," answered fiver.
     "pridge near. you go on, you see."
     where they were, the undergrowth stood close to the green path, but beyond --
downstream, as they all intuitively felt -- it gave way to open parkland. out into
this they went, hazel following fiver.

hazel saw without surprise the road crossing the river. what worried him was
that where it did so there were only very narrow verges of short grass, offering no
cover. his rabbits would be exposed to view and unable to bolt, except along the
road.
     "do you think we can risk it, fiver?" he asked.
     "i can't see why you're bothered," answered fiver. "you went into the farmyard
and the shed where the hutch rabbits were. this is much less dangerous. come on
-- they're all watching while we hesitate."
     fiver hopped out on the road. he looked round for a moment and then made
his way to the nearer end of the bridge. hazel followed him along the verge,
keeping close beside the rail on the upstream side. looking round, he saw pipkin
close behind. in the middle of the bridge f

iver, who was perfectly calm and
unhurried, stopped and sat up. the other two joined him.
     "let's put on a bit of an act," said fiver. "make them inquisitive. they'll follow
us just to see what we're looking at."
     there was no sill along the edge of the bridge: they could have walked off it
into the water three feet below. from under the lowest rail they looked out,
upstream, and now, for the first time, saw the whole river plainly. if the bridge
had not startled hazel, the river did. he remembered the enborne, its surface
broken by gravel spits and plant growth. the test, a weed-cut, carefully tended

surface. a moment later its blunt nose thrust clear of the stream and they saw the
open mouth, pure white inside. rhythmically, without haste, it sucked down a
floating sedge fly and sank back under water. a ripple spread outward in
subsiding circles, breaking both the reflections and the transparency. gradually
the stream grew smooth and once more they saw the fish below them, waving its
tail as it held its place in the current.
     "a water hawk!" said fiver. "so they hunt and eat down there, too! don't fall
in, hlao-roo. remember el-ahrairah and the pike."
     "would it eat me?" asked pipkin, staring.
     "there may be creatures in there that could," said hazel. "how do we know?
come on, let's get across. what would you do if a hrududu came?"
     "run," said fiver simply, "like this." and he scurried off the further end of the
bridge into the grass beyond.

nded almost down to the bridge. the ground was marshy, but at least there
was plenty of cover. fiver and pipkin began at once on some scrapes, while hazel
sat chewing pellets and resting his injured leg. soon they were joined by silver
and dandelion, but the other rabbits, more hesitant even than hazel, remained
crouching in the long grass on the right bank. at last, just before darkness fell,
fiver re-crossed the bridge and coaxed them to follow him back. bigwig, to
everyone's surprise, showed considerable reluctance, and only crossed in the end
after kehaar, returning from another flight over efrafa, had asked whether he
would like him to go and fetch a fox.
     the night that followed seemed to all of them disorganized and precarious.
hazel, still conscious of being in man country, was half expecting either a dog or a
cat. but although they heard owls more than once, no elil attacked t

     "what is it, kehaar? not a patrol?"
     "na, na. ees all fine for sleep like bloody owls. maybe i go for peeg vater.

     "no, you're right, kehaar, we must start now. the trouble is, i can see how to
start but not how to finish."
     hazel made his way through the grass, roused the first rabbit he found -- who
happened to be bluebell -- and sent him to fetch bigwig, blackberry and fiver.
when they came, he took them to join kehaar on the short grass of the riverbank.
     "this is the problem, blackberry," he said. "you remember that when we were
under the down that evening i said we should have to do three things: get the
does out of efrafa, break up the pursuit and then get right away so that they
wouldn't find us. this plan you've thought up is clever. it'll do the first two things,

already rising to the evening hatch of fly. just above the fall a plank footbridge
crossed the river. kehaar flew up, circled the pool and perched on the hand rail.
     "this is more sheltered and lonely than the bridge we crossed last night," said
blackberry. "perhaps we could make some use of it. you didn't know about this
bridge, kehaar, did you?"
     "na, not know, not see heem. but ees goot pridge -- no von come."

     "i'd like to go across, hazel-rah," said blackberry.
     "well, fiver's the rabbit for that," replied hazel. "he simply loves crossing
bridges. you carry on. i'll come behind, with bigwig and bluebell here."
     the five rabbits hopped slowly along the planks, their great, sensitive ears full
of the sound of the falling water. hazel, who was not sure of his footing, had to
stop several times. when at length he reached the further side, he found that
fiver and blackberry had already gone a little way downstream below the fall and
were looking at some large object

 sticking out from the bank. at first he thought
that it must be a fallen tree trunk, but as he came closer he saw that, although it
was certainly wooden, it was not round, but flat, or nearly flat, with raised edges
-- some man thing. he remembered how once, long ago, sniffing over a farm
rubbish heap with fiver, he had come upon a similar object -- large, smooth and
flat. (that had, in fact, been an old, discarded door.) it had been of no use to them
and they had left it alone. his inclination was to leave this alone, too.
     one end of the thing was pressed into the bank, but along its length it
diverged, sticking out slightly into the stream. there were ripples round it, for
under the banks the current was as swift as in midstream, on account of weed-
cutting and sound camp-sheeting. as hazel came

     kehaar went on pecking at the broken pieces of stale bread. blackberry, who
had finished the fragments of lettuce he had found, was sitting up and looking
over the very low side, watching a stone-colored, black-spotted trout swim up
into the fall. the "boat" was a miniature punt, used for reed-cutting -- little more
than a raft, with a single thwart amidships. even when it was unmanned, as now,
there were only a few inches of freeboard.
     "you know," said fiver from the bank, "seeing you sitting there reminds me of
that other wooden thing you found when the dog was in the wood and you got
pipkin and me over the river. do you remember?"
     "i remember shoving you along," said bigwig. "it was jolly cold."
     "what puzzles me," said blackberry, "is why this boat thing doesn't go along.
everything in this river goes along, and fast, too -- see there." he looked out at a
piece of stick floating down on the even two-mile-an-hour current. "so what's

ping this thing from going?"
     kehaar had a short-way-with-landlubbers manner which he sometimes used to
those of the rabbits that he did not particularly like. blackberry was not one of his

favorites: he preferred straightforward characters such as bigwig, buckthorn and
silver.
     "ees rope. you like bite heem, den you go damn queek, all de vay."
     "yes, i see," said fiver. "the rope goes round that metal thing where hazel's
sitting: and the other end's fixed on the bank here. it's like the stalk of a big leaf.
you could gnaw it through and the leaf -- the boat -- would drop off the bank."
     "well, anyway, let's go back now," said hazel, rather dejectedly. "i'm afraid we
don't seem to be any nearer to finding what we're looking for, kehaar. can you
possibly wait until tomorrow? i had the idea that we might all move to
somewhere a bit drier before tonight -- hi

"do you know, i'd quite decided to become a
water rabbit."
     "a what?" asked bigwig.
     "a water rabbit," repeated bluebell. "well, there are water rats and water
beetles and pipkin says that last night he saw a water hawk. so why not a water
rabbit? i shall float merrily along--"
     "great golden frith on a hill!" cried blackberry suddenly. "great jumping
rabscuttle! that's it! that's it! bluebell, you shall be a water rabbit!" he began
leaping and skipping about on the bank and cuffing fiver with his front paws.
"don't you see, fiver? don't you see? we bite the rope and off we go: and general
woundwort doesn't know!"
     fiver paused. "yes, i do see," he replied at length. "you mean on the boat. i
must say, blackberry, you're a clever fellow. i remember now that after we'd
crossed that other river you said that that floating trick might come in handy
again sometime."
     "here, wait a moment," said hazel. "we're just simple rabbits, bigwig and i.

and the pouring waterfall, blackberry and fiver explained.
     "could you just go and try the rope, hazel-rah?" added blackberry, when he
had finished. "it may be too thick."
     they went back to the punt.
     "no, it's not," said hazel, "and it's stretched tight, of course, which makes it
much easier to gnaw. i can gnaw that, all right."

ke most creatures who have experienced hardship and danger, he could
recognize and respect suffering when he saw it. he was accustomed to sizing up
other rabbits and deciding what they were good for. it struck him that these does
were not far from the end of their powers. a wild animal that feels that it no
longer has any reason to live reaches in the end a point when its remaining
energies may actually be directed toward dying. it was this state of mind that
bigwig had mistakenly attributed to fiver in the warren of the snares. since then
his judgment had matured. he felt that despair was not far from these does; and
from all that he had heard of efrafa, both from holly and from chervil, he could
understand why. he knew that the effects of overcrowding and tension in a
warren show themselves first in the does. they become infertile and aggressive.
but if aggression cannot mend their troubles, then often they begin to drift
toward the only other way out. he wondered what point on this disma

were closed and her claws dug into the floor.
     "hyzenthlay," whispered bigwig in her ear, "listen carefully. you remember
that many days ago now, four rabbits came to efrafa in the evening. one had very
pale gray fur and one had a healed rat bite in his foreleg. you talked with their
leader -- his name was holly. i know what he told you."
     she turned her head in fear. "how do you know?"
     "never mind. only listen to me."
     then bigwig spoke of hazel and fiver; of the destruction of the sandleford
warren and the journey to watership down. hyzenthlay neither moved nor
interrupted.
     "the rabbits who talked to you that evening," said bigwig, "who told you about
the warren that was destroyed and of how they had come to ask for does from
efrafa -- do you know what became of them?"
     hyzenthlay's reply was no more than the faintest murmur in his ear.

     bigwig wavered gradually up from sleep, like a bubble of marsh gas from the
bed of a still stream. there was another rabbit beside him in the burrow -- a buck.
he started up at once and said, "who is it?"
     "avens," replied the other. "time for silflay, thlayli. larks have gone up.
you're a sound sleeper."
     "i dare say," said bigwig. "well, i'm ready." he was about to lead the way down
the run, but avens' next words brought him to a halt.
     "who's fiver?" said avens.
     bigwig grew tense. "what did you say?"
     "i said, who's fiver?"
     "how should i know?"
     "well, you were talking in your sleep. you kept saying, 'ask fiver, ask fiver.' i
wondered who he was."
     "oh, i see. a rabbit i knew once. he used to foretell the weather and so on."

     "well, he could do it now, then. can you smell the thunder?"
     bigwig sniffed. mixed with the scents of grass and cattle came the warm, thick
smell of a heavy cloud mass, still far off.

to one of the police escort, who was blocking the mouth to make sure that
blackavar did not try to bolt as he was taken down.
     "get out of my way, you dirty little tale-bearing bloodsucker," said bigwig.
"now go and report that," he added over his shoulder, as he went down to his
burrow.

          -<*>-

     as the light faded from the thick sky, hazel slipped once more across the hard,
bare earth under the railway arch, came out on the north side and sat up to listen.
a few moments later fiver joined him and they crept a little way into the field,
toward efrafa. the air was close and warm and smelled of rain and ripening
barley. there was no sound close by, but behind and below them, from the water
meadow on the nearer bank of the test, came faintly the shrill, incessant fussing

of a pair of sandpipers. kehaar flew down from the top of the embankment.

     hazel made no reply.

the bottom of a river. anything could be happening in there."
     "bigwig's there. suppose he's dead? suppose they're trying to make him tell
them--"
     "hazel," said fiver. "hazel-rah, you won't help him by staying here in the dark
and worrying. quite likely there's nothing wrong. he's just had to sit tight for
some reason. anyway, he won't come tonight -- that's certain now -- and our
rabbits are in danger here. kehaar can go up tomorrow at dawn and bring us
another message."
     "i dare say you're right," said hazel, "but i hate to go. just suppose he were to

     "listen, hazel-rah," said blackberry. "we ought to reach the iron road at the
same time as bigwig and not a moment before. why don't you take them all over
the river now and wait in the undergrowth, near the boat? once kehaar's attacked
the sentries, he can fly back and tell us."
     "yes, that's it," answered hazel. "but once he's told us, we must get up there in
no time at all. bigwig's going to need us as well as kehaar."
     "well, you won't be able to dash up to the arch," said fiver, "with your leg. the
best thing you can do is to get on the boat and have the rope gnawed half through
by the time we come back. silver can look after the fighting, if there's going to be
any."
     hazel hesitated. "but some of us are probably going to get hurt. i can't stay
behind."
     "fiver's right," said blackberry. "you will have to wait on the boat, hazel. we

creature visible above the ground haze. bigwig and silver brought them together
as best they could and made them understand that they were to help to get the

     "go back to blackberry, go back to blackberry," silver kept repeating. "i left
three of our rabbits in different places to mark the way back," he explained to
bigwig. "blackberry's first, then bluebell, then fiver -- he's quite near the river."
     "and there is blackberry," said bigwig.
     "you did it, then, bigwig," said blackberry, shivering. "was it very bad? good
heavens, your shoulder--"
     "it's not finished yet," said bigwig. "has everyone passed you?"
     "you're the last," said blackberry. "can we go? this storm's terrifying me!"

     fiver came running through the undergrowth.

of them won't trust me. they just keep asking where you are."
     bigwig ran behind him and came out on the green path by the bank. all the
surface of the river was winking and plopping in the rain. the level did not appear
to have risen much as yet. the boat was just as he remembered it -- one end
against the bank, the other a little way out in the stream. on the raised par

    bigwig began to understand why woundwort's officers followed him and
fought for him as they did.
     "he's not like a rabbit at all," he thought. "flight's the last thing he ever thinks
of. if i'd known three nights ago what i know now, i don't believe i'd ever have
gone into efrafa. i suppose he hasn't realized about the boat, too? it wouldn't
surprise me." he dashed across the grass and jumped on the planking beside
hazel.
     the appearance of woundwort had achieved what blackberry and fiver could
not. every one of the does ran from the bank to the boat. blackberry and fiver
ran with them. woundwort, following them close, reached the edge of the bank
and came face to face with bigwig. as he stood his ground, bigwig could hear
blackberry just behind him, speaking urgently to hazel.
     "dandelion's not here," said blackberry. "he's the only one."
     hazel spoke for the first time. "we shall have to leave him," he answered. "it's

confusion of boarding the punt, had found themselves in this water, but now all
had got clear of it -- most either to bows or stern, though thethuthinnang and
speedwell were hunched on the narrow thwart, amidships. in addition to their
discomfort, they were exposed and helpless. finally, there was no way of
controlling the punt and they did not know where they were going. but these last
were troubles beyond the understanding of everyone but hazel, fiver and
blackberry.

     bigwig had collapsed beside hazel and lay on his side, exhausted. the feverish
courage which had brought him from efrafa to the river had gone and his
wounded shoulder had begun to hurt badly. in spite of the rain and the throbbing
pulse down his foreleg, he felt ready to sleep where he was, stretched upon the
planking. he opened his eyes and looked up at hazel.
     "i couldn't do it again, hazel-rah," he said.
     "you haven't got to," replied hazel.

     "did you beat him?"
     "oh, yes -- or i shouldn't be here. i should think he'll stop running. i say,
hazel-rah, we've got the does. what's going to happen now?"
     "i don't know," said hazel. "we need one of these clever rabbits to tell us. and
kehaar -- where's he gone? he's supposed to know about this thing we're sitting
on."
     dandelion, crouching beside hazel, got up at the mention of "clever rabbits,"
made his way across the puddled floor and returned with blackberry and fiver.
     "we're all wondering what to do next," said hazel.
     "well," said blackberry, "i suppose we shall drift into the bank before long and
then we can get out and find cover. there's no harm, though, in going a good long
way from those friends of bigwig's."
     "there is," said hazel. "we're stuck here in full view and we can't run. if a man
sees us we're in trouble."
     "men don't like rain," said blackberry. "neither do i, if it comes to that, but it
makes us safer just now."

with wet fur."
     kehaar reappeared on the parapet above.
     "you go now," he said shortly.
     still the wretched hazel hung back. his leg had begun to hurt again. the sight
of bigwig -- bigwig of all rabbits -- at the end of his tether, half unconscious,
playing no part in this desperate exploit, lowered his courage still more. he knew
that he had not got it in him to jump into the water. the horrible situation was
beyond him. he stumbled on the slippery planking and, as he sat up, found fiver
beside him.
     "i'll go, hazel," said fiver quietly. "i think it'll be all right."
     he put his front paws on the edge of the bow. then, on the instant, all the
rabbits froze motionless. one of the does stamped on the puddled floor of the
punt. from above came the sounds of approaching footsteps and men's voices,
and the smell of a burning white stick.
     kehaar flew away. not a rabbit moved. the footsteps grew nearer, the voices
louder. they were on the bridge above, no further away tha

track was empty and there was nothing to be heard or smelled. they crossed it
and reached the end of the bridge on the upstream side. here the bank dropped
almost sheer to the river, some six feet below. blackavar scrambled down without
hesitation, but hazel followed more slowly. just above the bridge, between it and
a thorn bush upstream, was a ledge of turf which overhung the water. out in the
river, a few feet away, the punt lay against the weedy piers.
     "silver!" said hazel. "fiver! come on, get them into the water. it's all right
below the bridge. get the does in first, if you can. there's no time to lose. the
men may come back."
     it was no easy matter to rouse the torpid, bewildered does and make them
understand what they had to do. silver went from one to another. dandelion, as
soon as he saw hazel on the bank, went at once to the bow and plunged in.
speedwell followed, but as fiver was about to go silver stopped him.
     "if all our bucks go, hazel," he said, "th

 and in this
way acorn, hawkbit and bluebell all scrambled over the side. the injured doe,
thrayonlosa, was clearly in a bad way and blackberry and thethuthinnang swam
through together, one in front of her and one behind.
     as darkness closed in, the rain stopped. hazel and blackavar went back to the
bank of the pool below the bridge. the sky cleared and the oppression lifted as
the thunder moved away eastward. but it was fu inlé before bigwig himself came
through the bridge with silver and fiver. it was as much as ever he could do to
keep afloat, and when he reached the grating he rolled over in the water, belly
uppermost, like a dying fish. he drifted into the shallows and, with silver's help,
pulled himself out. hazel and several of the others were waiting for him, but he
cut them short with a flash of his old bullying manner. "come on, get out of the
way," he said. "i'm going to sleep now, hazel, and frith help you if you say i'm
not."
     "that's how we go on, you see," said hazel

g, with many halts in cover,
they found themselves, late one afternoon, once more in sight of caesar's belt,
but further west than before, close to a little copse at the top of some rising
ground. everyone was tired and when they had fed -- "evening silflay every day,
just as you promised," said hyzenthlay to bigwig -- bluebell and speedwell
suggested that it might be worthwhile to dig some scrapes in the light soil under
the trees and live there for a day or two. hazel felt willing enough, but fiver
needed persuasion.
     "i know we can do with a rest, but somehow i don't altogether like it, hazel-
rah," he said. "i suppose i've got to try to think why?"
     "not on my account," answered hazel. "but i doubt you'll shift the others this
time. one or two of these does are 'ready for mudder,' as kehaar would say, and
that's the real reason why bluebell and the rest are prepared to be at the trouble
of digging scrapes. surely it'll be all right at that rate, won't it? you know what
they say

-- 'rabbit underground, rabbit safe and sound.'"
     "well, you may be right," said fiver. "that vilthuril's a beautiful doe. i'd like a
chance to get to know her better. after all, it's not natural to rabbits, is it? -- on
and on day after day."
     later, however, when blackavar returned with dandelion from a patrol they
had undertaken on their own initiative, he came out more strongly against the
idea.
     "this is no place to stop, hazel-rah," he said. "no wide patrol would bivouac
here. it's fox country. we ought to try to get further before dark."
     bigwig's shoulder had

t about a story now?" said bluebell. "come on, dandelion. 'how i nearly
missed the boat.' what about that?"
     "oh, you mean 'woundwort dismayed,'" said dandelion. "that's bigwig's story
-- i wouldn't presume to tell it. but it makes a change to be thinking about winter
on an evening like this. it reminds me of a story i've listened to but never tried to
tell myself. so some of you may know it and perhaps some won't. it's the story of
rowsby woof and the fairy wogdog."
     "off you go," said fiver, "and lay it on thick."

     "there was a big rabbit," said dandelion. "there was a small rabbit. there was
el-ahrairah; and he had the frost in his fine new whiskers. the earth up and down
the runs of the warren was so hard that you could cut your paws on it, and the
robins answered each other across the bare, still copses, 'this is my bit here. you
go and starve in your own.'

aged to leave."
     "well, don't you leave," said hazel, "or i'll tell kehaar to bring you back by the
scruff of the neck. i'm relying on you to produce us a really good owsla."
     "it's certainly something to look forward to," said bigwig. "take a pack of
young fellows across to the farm and chase the cats out of the barn to get an
appetite. well, it'll come. i say, this grass is as dry as horsehair on barbed wire,
isn't it? what about a run down the hill to the fields -- just you and i and fiver?
corn's been cut, you know, and there should be good pickings. i expect they're
going to burn off the field, but they haven't done it yet."
     "no, we must wait a bit," said hazel. "i want to hear what holly and blackavar
have to say when they come in."
     "that needn't keep you long," replied bigwig. "here they come already, unless
i'm much mistaken. straight down the open track, too! not bothered about
keeping hidden, are they? what a rate they're going!"

d of the
clever track they had run. but what could stop woundwort? what could save
them now? nothing, he knew -- unless some tremendous blow were to fall upon
the efrafans from outside: and of that there was no chance. he turned away from
buckthorn.

     scratch, scratch: scratch, scratch came the sound of the digging above.
crossing the floor in the dark, hazel found himself beside another rabbit, who
was crouching silently on the near side of the new-piled wall. he stopped,
sniffing. it was fiver.
     "aren't you working?" he asked listlessly.
     "no," replied fiver. "i'm listening."
     "to the digging, you mean?"
     "no, not the digging. there's something i'm trying to hear -- something the
others can't hear. only i can't hear it either. but it's close. deep. leaf-drift, deep.
i'm going away, hazel -- going away." his voice grew slow and drowsy. "falling.
but it's cold. cold."
     the air in the dark burrow was stifling. hazel bent over fiver, pushing the limp
body with his nos

     "cold," muttered fiver. "how -- how. how -- how cold!"
     there was a long silence.
     "fiver?" said hazel. "fiver? can you hear me?"
     suddenly a terrible sound broke from fiver; a sound at which every rabbit in
the warren leaped in dreadful fear; a sound that no rabbit had ever made, that no
rabbit had the power to make. it was deep and utterly unnatural. the rabbits
working on the far side of the wall crouched terrified. one of the does began to
squeal.
     "dirty little beasts," yelped fiver. "how -- how dare you? get out -- out! out --
out!"
     bigwig burst through the piled earth, twitching and panting.
     "in the name of frith, stop him!" he gasped. "they'll

 all go mad!"
     shuddering, hazel clawed at fiver's side.
     "wake! fiver, wake!"
     but fiver was lying in a deep stupor.
     in hazel's mind, green branches were straining in the wind. up and down they
swayed, thresh and ply. there was something -- something he could glimpse
between them. what was it? water he sensed; and fear. then suddenly he saw
clearly, for an instant, a little huddle of rabbits on the bank of a stream at dawn,
listening to the sound of yelping in the wood above and the scolding of a jay.
     "if i were you, i shouldn't wait until ni-frith. i should go now. in fa

he was in the honeycomb, facing bigwig in the dark, across the motionless body
of fiver. the scratching from above was louder and closer.
     "bigwig," said hazel, "do as i say at once, there's a good fellow. we've got
hardly any time. go and get dandelion and blackberry and bring them to me at
the foot of kehaar's run, quickly."
     at the foot of the run buckthorn was still in his place. he had not moved at
fiver's cry, but his breath was short and his pulse very quick. he and the other
three rabbits gathered about hazel without a word.
     "i've got a plan," said hazel. "if

like woundwort."
     "but suppose they break through the wall somewhere else?" said holly.
     "you must try to make them do it here," replied bigwig. "when you hear them
on the other side, make a noise -- do a bit of scratching or something -- just above
where i am. anything to get them interested. come on, help me to dig. and,
silver, get everyone back out of the honeycomb now and close this wall
completely."

     "bigwig," said pipkin, "i can't wake fiver. he's still lying out there in the
middle of the floor. what's to be done?"
     "i'm afraid there's nothing we can do now," replied bigwig. "it's a great pity,
but we'll have to leave him."
     "oh, bigwig," cried pipkin, "let me stay out there with him! you'll never miss
me, and i can go on trying--"
     "hlao-roo," said holly as kindly as he could, "if we lose no one but fiver before
this business is ended, then the lord frith himself will be fighting for us. no, i'm

choking. though bigwig did not know it, his earlier blows had torn woundwort
across the nose. his nostrils were full of his own blood, and with jaws closed in
bigwig's fur he could not draw his breath. a moment more and he let go his hold.
bigwig, utterly exhausted, lay where he was. after a few moments he tried to get
up, but a faintness came over him and a feeling of turning over and over in a ditch

of leaves. he closed his eyes. there was silence and then, quite clearly, he heard
fiver speaking in the long grass. "you are closer to death than i. you are closer to
death than i."
     "the wire!" squealed bigwig. he jerked himself up and opened his eyes. the
run was empty. general woundwort was gone.

          -<*>-

     woundwort clambered out into the honeycomb, now dimly lit down the shaft
by the daylight outside. he had never felt so tired. he saw vervain and thunder
looking at him uncertainly. he sat on his haunches and tried to clean his face with
his front paws.

keep going. during the afternoon of the following day, while the off fore mark
were at silflay, he came limping through the sentry line with a straggling handful
of six or seven rabbits. he was close to collapse himself and scarcely able to give
the council any account of the disaster.
     only groundsel, thistle and three others had the presence of mind to dart
down the opened run when the dog came. back in the honeycomb, groundsel
immediately surrendered himself and his fugitives to fiver, who was still
bemused from his long trance, and scarcely restored to his senses sufficiently to
grasp what was toward. at length, however, after the five efrafans had remained
crouching for some time in the burrow, listening to the sounds of the dog hunting
above, fiver recovered himself, made his way to the mouth of the run where
bigwig still lay half conscious, and succeeded in making holly and silver
understand that the siege was ended. there was no lack of helpers to tear open
the blocked

gaps in the south wall. it so happened that bluebell was the first
through into the honeycomb; and for many days afterward he was still improving
upon his imitation of captain fiver at the head of his crowd of efrafan prisoners
-- "like a tomtit rounding up a bunch of molting jackdaws," as he put it.

     no one was inclined to pay them much attention at the time, however, for the
only thoughts throughout the warren were for hazel and bigwig. bigwig seemed
likely to die. bleeding in half a dozen places, he lay with closed eyes in the run he
had defended and made no reply when hyzenthlay told him that the efrafans
were defeated and the warren was saved. after a time, they

s the day wore on the does, each in turn, remained beside
him, licking his wounds and listening to his low, unsteady breathing.
     before this, blackberry and dandelion had burrowed their way in from
kehaar's run -- it had not been blocked very heavily -- and told their story. they
could not say what might have happened to hazel after the dog broke loose, and
by the early afternoon everyone feared the worst. at last pipkin, in great anxiety
and distress, insisted on setting out for nuthanger. fiver at once said that he
would go with him and together they left the wood and set off northward over the
down. they had gone only a short distance when fiver, sitting up on an anthill to
look about, saw a rabbit approaching over the high ground to the west. they both
ran nearer and recognized hazel. fiver went to meet him while pipkin raced back
to the honeycomb with the news.
     as soon as he had learned all that had happened -- including what groundsel
had to tell -- hazel asked holly to take

     "and you flew the rest, i suppose," said bigwig, "burning a white stick in your
mouth? come on, tell me sensibly. what's the matter, hyzenthlay?"
     "oh!" said hyzenthlay, staring. "oh!"
     "what is it?"
     "he did!"
     "did what?"
     "he did ride home in a hrududu. and i saw him as he came -- that night in
efrafa, when i was with you in your burrow. do you remember?"

     "i remember," said bigwig. "i remember what i said, too. i said you'd better tell
it to fiver. that's a good idea -- let's go and do it. and if he'll believe you, hazel-
rah, then i will."

the time of greatest fertility for the does starts about february. there are fine

days when silflay is still enjoyable. for the adventurous, garden-raiding has its
charms. and underground there are stories to be told and games to be played --
bob-stones and the like. for rabbits, winter remains what it was for men in the
middle ages -- hard, but bearable by the resourceful and not altogether without
compensations.
     on the west side of the beech hanger, in the evening sun, hazel and fiver were
sitting with holly, silver and groundsel. the efrafan survivors had been allowed
to join the warren and after a shaky start, when they were regarded with dislike
and suspicion, were settling down pretty well, largely because hazel was
determined that they should.
     since the night of the siege, fiver had spent much time alone and even in the
honeycomb, or at morning and evening silflay, was often silent and preoccupied.
no one resented this -- "he looks right through you in such a nice,
 
 ___________________________
 
 friendly way,"
as bluebell put it -- for each in his own manner recognized that fiver was now
more than ever governed, whether he would or no, by the pulse of that mysterious
world of which he had once spoken to hazel during the late june days they had
spent together at the foot of the down. it was bigwig who said -- one evening
when fiver was absent from the honeycomb at story time -- that fiver was one
who had paid more dearly than even himself for the night's victory over the
efrafans. yet to his doe, vilthuril, fiver was devotedly attached, while she had
come to understand him almost as deeply as ever hazel had.
     just outside the beech hanger, hyzenthlay's litter of four young rabbits were
playing in the grass. they had first been brought up to graze about seven days
before. if hyzenthlay had had a second litter she would by this time have left
them to look after themselves. as

sun sank lower. at last, just as
vilthuril was about to go on with the story, they heard hooves on the turf and the
horseman appeared from the west, cantering easily along the track toward
cannon heath down.
     "he won't bother us," said silver. "no need to run: he'll just go by. you're a
funny chap, though, young threar, to spot him so far off."
     "he's always doing things like that," said vilthuril. "the other day he told me
what a river looked like and said he'd seen it in a dream. it's fiver's blood, you
know. it's only to be expected with fiver's blood."
     "fiver's blood?" said hazel. "well, as long as we've got some of that i dare say
we'll be all right. but, you know, it's turning chilly here, isn't it? come on, let's go
down, and hear the rest of that story in a good, warm burrow. look, there's fiver
over on the bank now. who's going to get to him first?"
     a few minutes later there was not a rabbit to be seen on the down. the sun

     "and what happened in the end?" asks the reader who has followed hazel and
his comrades in all their adventures and returned with them at last to the warren
where fiver brought them from the fields of sandleford. the wise mr. lockley has
told us that wild rabbits live for two or three years. he knows everything about
rabbits: but all the same, hazel lived longer than that. he lived a tidy few
summers -- as they say in that part of the world -- and learned to know well the
changes of the downs to spring, to winter and to spring again. he saw more young
rabbits than he could remember. and sometimes, when they told tales on a sunny
