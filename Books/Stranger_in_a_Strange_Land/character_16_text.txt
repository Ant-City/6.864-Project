 "thanks, i'll wait right here."
 they waited. frisby broke out a cigar, cavendish waited with the calm patience of one who has
seen all manner of good and evil and now counts them both the same, caxton uttered and tried to keep
from biting his nails. at last the snow queen behind the desk announced, "mr. berquist will see you."
 "berquist? gil berquist?"
 "i believe his name is mr. gilbert berquist."
 caxton thought about it-gil berquist was one of secretary douglas's large squad of stooges, or
"executive assistants." he specialized in chaperoning official visitors. "i don't want to see berquist; i want
the director."
 but berquist was already coming out, hand shoved out before him, greeter's grin plastered on his
face. "benny caxton! how are you, chum? long time and so forth. still peddling the same old line of
hoke?" he glanced at the fair witness, but his expression admitted nothing.

to talk him out of it, then went with him. it now appears that this same top-level stooge also dropped out
of sight last thursday - . . and i don't think it is a coincidence, not when he appears to have been in
charge of the phony 'man from mars.' if we find him, we may find ben, gilbert berquist is his name and i
have reason-"
 "berquist?"
 "that's the name. and i have reason to suspect that-jill, what's the trouble? stop it! don't faint,
or sweip me, i'll dunk you in the pool!"
 "jubal. this 'berquist.' is there more than one berquist?"
 "eh? i suppose so ... though from all i can find out he does seem to be a bit of a bastard; there
might be only one. out i mean the one on the executive staff. why? do you know him?"
 "i don't know. but if it is the same one ... i don't think there's

bal reviewed in his own excellent memory all that witness cavendish had reported concerning the
missing berquist, plus the report on him from the detective service. yup, he thought happily, this lad is at
least three rungs down the ladder from where berquist was-so let's shake him up a little . . . and climb a
couple of rungs in the process.
 the face said woodenly, "we have no mr. berquist here."
 "i don't care where he is. get him! if you don't know gil berquist personally, ask your boss. mr.
gilbert berquist, personal assistant to mr. douglas. if you've been around the palace more than two
weeks you've at least seen mr. berquist at a distance-thirty-five years old, about six feet and a hundred
and eighty pounds, sandy hair a little thin on top, smiles a lot and has perfect teeth. you've seen him. if
you don't dare disturb him yourself, dump it in your boss's lap. but quit biting your nails and do
something. i'm getting annoyed."
 without expression the young man said, "please hold on. i will enquir

sooner or later. "all right, go ahead. but come talk to me about it later."
 "yes, jubal."
 harshaw was about to add some advice intended to offset mike's tendency to take literally
anything he saw or heard. but the telephone's soothing "hold" music suddenly went down and out, and
the screen filled with an image-a man in his forties whom jubal at once labeled in his mind as "cop."
 jubal said aggressively, "you aren't gil berquist."
 the man said, "what is your interest in gilbert berquist?"
 jubal answered with pained patience, "i wish to speak to him. see here, my good man, are you a
public employee?"
 the man barely hesitated. "yes. you must-"
 "i 'must' nothing! i am a citizen in good standing and my taxes go to pay your wages. all morning
i have been trying to make a simple phone call-and i have been passed from one butterfly-brained
bovine to another, and every one of them feeding out of the public trough. i am sick of it and i do not
intend to put up with it any longer. an

his identification, which jubal glanced at, then turned back to him for him
to show to anne. heinrich then stated his full name, said that he was a captain of police, federation
special service bureau, and recited his pay number. one by one, the other six men who had left the car,
and at last the driver, went through the same rigamarole at heinrich's frozen-faced orders.
 when they were done, jubal said sweetly, "and now, captain heinrich, how may i help you?"
 "i have a search warrant here for gilbert berquist, which warrant names this property, its
buildings and grounds."
 "show it to me, then show it to the witness."
 "i will do so. but i have another search warrant, similar to the first, for gillian boardman."
 "who?"
 "gillian boardman. the charge is kidnapping."
 "my goodness!"
 "and another for hector c. johnson ... and one for valentine michael smith . . . and one for
you, jubal harshaw."
 "me? taxes again?"
 "no. look at it. accessory to this and that ... and material witness on some other th
