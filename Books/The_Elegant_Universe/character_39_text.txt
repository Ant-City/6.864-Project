l feel the familiar force of the floor on your feet, just as in the scenario of
upward  acceleration;  this  is  exactly  the  same  equivalence  albert  exploited  in  his  solution  for
launching the terrorist bomb into space. if your compartment is resting on its back end you will feel
the force of your seat on your back (preventing you from falling), just as when you were accelerating
horizontally.  einstein  called  the  indistinguishability  between  accelerated  motion  and  gravity  the
equivalence principle. it plays a central role in general relativity.2

this  description  shows  that  general  relativity  finishes  a  job  initiated  by  special  relativity.
through  its  principle  of  relativity,  the  special  theory  of  relativity  declares  a  democracy  of
observational  vantage  points:  the  laws  of  physics  appear  identical  to  all  observers  undergoing

constant-velocity motion. but this is limited democracy indeed, for it excludes an enormous number
of other viewpoints—those

 question  of  why  a  certain  force
exists to why nature respects its associated symmetry principle. but this certainly feels like progress,
especially  when  the  symmetry  in  question  is  one  that  seems  eminently  natural.  for  example,  why
should  one  observer's  frame  of  reference  be  treated  differently  from  another's?  it  seems  far  more
natural  for  the  laws  of  the  universe  to  treat  all  observational  vantage  points  equally;  this  is
accomplished through the equivalence principle and the introduction of gravity into the structure of
the cosmos. although it requires some mathematical background to appreciate fully, as we indicated
in  chapter  5,  there  is  a  similar  rationale  behind  the  gauge  symmetries  underlying  the  three
nongravitational forces.

string theory takes us down another notch on the scale of explanatory depth because all of these
symmetry  principles,  as  well  as  another—supersymmetry—emerge  from  its  structure.  in  fact,  had

followed a different course—and had physicists come upon string theory some hundred years
earlier—we can imagine that these symmetry principles would have all been discovered by studying
its properties. but bear in mind that whereas the equivalence principle gives us some understanding
of why gravity exists, and the gauge symmetries give us some sense of why the nongravitational forces
exist, in the context of string theory these symmetries are consequences; although their importance is
in no way diminished, they are part of the end product of a much larger theoretical structure.

this  discussion  brings  the  following  question  into  sharp  relief:  is  string  theory  itself  an
inevitable  consequence  of  some  broader  principle—possibly

 but  not  necessarily  a  symmetry
principle—in much the same way that the equivalence principle inexorably leads to general relativity
or that gauge symmetries lead to the nongravitational forces? as of this writing, no one has any insight
into the answer to this question. to appreciate its importance, we need only imagine einstein trying to
formulate general relativity without having had the happy thought he experienced in the bern patent
office  in  1907  that  led  him  to  the  principle  of  equivalence.  it  would  not  have  been  impossible  to
formulate  general  relativity  with

out  first  having  this  key  insight,  but  it  certainly  would  have  been
extremely  difficult.  the  equivalence  principle  provides  a  succinct,  systematic,  and  powerful
organizational framework for analyzing the gravitational force. the description of general relativity
we gave in chapter 3, for example, relied centrally on the equivalence principle, and its role in the
full mathematical formalism of the theory is even more crucial.

currently, string theorists are in a position analogous to an einstein bereft of the equivalence
principle. since veneziano's insightful guess in 1968, the theory has been pieced together, discovery
by  discovery,  revolution  by  revolution.  but  a  central  organizing  principle  that  embraces  these
discoveries and all other features of the theory within one overarching and systematic framework—a

2. a bit more precisely, einstein realized that the equivalence principle holds so long as your
observations are confined to a small enough region of space—that is, so long as your "compartment"
is  small  enough.  the  reason  is  the  following.  gravitational  fields  can  vary  in  strength  (and  in
direction) from place to place. but we are imagining that your whole compartment accelerates as a
single unit and therefore your acceleration simulates a single, uniform gravitational force field. as
your compartment gets ever smaller, though, there is ever less ro
