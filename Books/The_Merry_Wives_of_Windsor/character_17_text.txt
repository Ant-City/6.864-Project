, being reconciled
to the prince your brother: i owe you all
duetie

   iohn. i thanke you, i am not of many words, but i
thanke you

   leon. please it your grace leade on?
  pedro. your hand leonato, we will goe together.

exeunt. manet benedicke and claudio.

  clau. benedicke, didst thou note the daughter of signior
leonato?
  bene. i noted her not, but i lookt on her

   claud. is she not a modest yong ladie?
  bene. doe you question me as an honest man should
doe, for my simple true iudgement? or would you haue
me speake after my custome, as being a professed tyrant
to their sexe?
  clau. no, i pray thee speake in sober iudgement

   bene. why yfaith me thinks shee's too low for a hie
praise, too browne for a faire praise, and too little for a
great praise, onely this commendation i can affoord her,
that were shee other then she is, she were vnhandsome,
and being no other, but as she is, i doe not like her

   clau. thou think'st i am in sport, i pray thee

 truth, i neuer yet saw man,
how wise, how noble, yong, how rarely featur'd.
but she would spell him backward: if faire fac'd,
she would sweare the gentleman should be her sister:
if blacke, why nature drawing of an anticke,
made a foule blot: if tall, a launce ill headed:
if low, an agot very vildlie cut:
if speaking, why a vane blowne with all windes:
if silent, why a blocke moued with none.
so turnes she euery man the wrong side out,
and neuer giues to truth and vertue, that
which simplenesse and merit purchaseth

   vrsu. sure, sure, such carping is not commendable

   hero. no, not to be so odde, and from all fashions,
as beatrice is, cannot be commendable,
but who dare tell her so? if i should speake,
she would mocke me into ayre, o she would laugh me
out of my selfe, presse me to death with wit,
therefore let benedicke like couered fire,
consume away in sighes, waste inwardly:
it were a better death, to die with mockes,
which is as bad as die with tickling

 i to giue you back, whose worth
may counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
  prin. nothing, vnlesse you render her againe

   clau. sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulnes:
there leonato, take her backe againe,
giue not this rotten orenge to your friend,
shee's but the signe and semblance of her honour:
behold how like a maid she blushes heere!
o what authoritie and shew of truth
can cunning sinne couer it selfe withall!
comes not that bloud, as modest euidence,
to witnesse simple vertue? would you not sweare
all you that see her, that she were a maide,
by these exterior shewes? but she is none:
she knowes the heat of a luxurious bed:
her blush is guiltinesse, not modestie

   leonato. what doe you meane, my lord?
  clau. not to be married,
not to knit my soule to an approued wanton

   leon. deere my lord, if you in your owne proofe,
haue vanquisht the resistance of her youth,
and made defeat of her virginitie

   clau. i know what you would say: if i haue
