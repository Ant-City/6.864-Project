the [CHARACTER] - 
                the
[CHARACTER] of brobdingnag, who, in contrast to the emperor of lilliput,
seems to be a true intellectual, well versed in political science
among other disciplines. while his wife has an intimate, friendly
relationship with the diminutive visitor, the [CHARACTER]'s relation to gulliver
is limited to serious discussions about the history and institutions
of gulliver's native land. he is thus a figure of rational thought
who somewhat prefigures the houyhnhnms in book iv.
