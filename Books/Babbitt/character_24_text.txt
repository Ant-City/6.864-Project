's house all evening while you sit and gas about lite'ature
and the highbrows you're going to marry--if they only propose!"

"well, dad oughtn't to ever let you have it! you and those beastly jones
boys drive like maniacs. the idea of your taking the turn on chautauqua
place at forty miles an hour!"

"aw, where do you get that stuff! you're so darn scared of the car that
you drive up-hill with the emergency brake on!"

"i do not! and you--always talking about how much you know about motors,
and eunice littlefield told me you said the battery fed the generator!"

"you--why, my good woman, you don't know a generator from a
differential." not unreasonably was ted lofty with her. he was a natural
mechanic, a maker and tinkerer of machines; he lisped in blueprints for
the blueprints came.

"that'll do now!" babbitt flung in mechanically, as he lighted the
gloriously satisfying first cigar of the day and tasted the exhilarating
drug of the advocate-times headlines.

ted negotiated: "gee, honest, rone, i don't

 digamma this year. there's two fellows that their dads
are millionaires. say, gee, i ought to have a car of my own, like lots
of the fellows." babbitt almost rose. "a car of your own! don't you want
a yacht, and a house and lot? that pretty nearly takes the cake! a boy
that can't pass his latin examinations, like any other boy ought to, and
he expects me to give him a motor-car, and i suppose a chauffeur, and an
areoplane maybe, as a reward for the hard work he puts in going to the
movies with eunice littlefield! well, when you see me giving you--"

somewhat later, after diplomacies, ted persuaded verona to admit that
she was merely going to the armory, that evening, to see the dog and
cat show. she was then, ted planned, to park the car in front of the
candy-store across from the armory and he would pick it up. there were
masterly arrangements regarding leaving the key, and having the gasoline
tank filled; and passionately, devotees of the great god motor, they
hymned the patch on the spare inner-tube

 was as a spiritual example. despite
his strange learnings he was as strict a presbyterian and as firm a
republican as george f. babbitt. he confirmed the business men in the
faith. where they knew only by passionate instinct that their system of
industry and manners was perfect, dr. howard littlefield proved it
to them, out of history, economics, and the confessions of reformed
radicals.

babbitt had a good deal of honest pride in being the neighbor of such a
savant, and in ted's intimacy with eunice littlefield. at sixteen
eunice was interested in no statistics save those regarding the ages
and salaries of motion-picture stars, but--as babbitt definitively put
it--"she was her father's daughter."

the difference between a light man like sam doppelbrau and a really fine
character like littlefield was revealed in their appearances. doppelbrau
was disturbingly young for a man of forty-eight. he wore his derby on
the back of his head, and his red face was wrinkled with meaningless
laughter. but littlefiel

fon, coral velvet, or cloth of gold, and
around their dipping bobbed hair were shining wreaths. he had it, upon
urgent and secret inquiry, that no corsets were known to be parked
upstairs; but certainly these eager bodies were not stiff with steel.
their stockings were of lustrous silk, their slippers costly and
unnatural, their lips carmined and their eyebrows penciled. they danced
cheek to cheek with the boys, and babbitt sickened with apprehension and
unconscious envy.

worst of them all was eunice littlefield, and maddest of all the boys
was ted. eunice was a flying demon. she slid the length of the room; her
tender shoulders swayed; her feet were deft as a weaver's shuttle; she
laughed, and enticed babbitt to dance with her.

then he discovered the annex to the party.

the boys and girls disappeared occasionally, and he remembered rumors
of their drinking together from hip-pocket flasks. he tiptoed round the
house, and in each of the dozen cars waiting in the street he saw the
points of light from

ed. "myra simply can't understand. all
she sees in life is getting along by being just like other folks. but
tanis, she'd tell me i was all right."

then he broke, and one evening, late, he did run to tanis. he had not
dared to hope for it, but she was in, and alone. only she wasn't tanis.
she was a courteous, brow-lifting, ice-armored woman who looked like
tanis. she said, "yes, george, what is it?" in even and uninterested
tones, and he crept away, whipped.

his first comfort was from ted and eunice littlefield.

they danced in one evening when ted was home from the university, and
ted chuckled, "what's this i hear from euny, dad? she says her dad says
you raised cain by boosting old seneca doane. hot dog! give 'em fits!
stir 'em up! this old burg is asleep!" eunice plumped down on babbitt's
lap, kissed him, nestled her bobbed hair against his chin, and crowed;
"i think you're lots nicer than howard. why is it," confidentially,
"that howard is such an old grouch? the man has a good heart, and

the secret purchase of lots along the evanston road. but as he drove to
his office he struggled, "i'm going to run things and figure out things

ted had come down from the university for the week-end. though he no
longer spoke of mechanical engineering and though he was reticent about
his opinion of his instructors, he seemed no more reconciled to college,
and his chief interest was his wireless telephone set.

on saturday evening he took eunice littlefield to a dance at devon
woods. babbitt had a glimpse of her, bouncing in the seat of the car,
brilliant in a scarlet cloak over a frock of thinnest creamy silk. they
two had not returned when the babbitts went to bed, at half-past eleven.
at a blurred indefinite time of late night babbitt was awakened by
the ring of the telephone and gloomily crawled down-stairs. howard
littlefield was speaking:

"george, euny isn't back yet. is ted?"

"no--at least his door is open--"

"they ought to be home. euni
