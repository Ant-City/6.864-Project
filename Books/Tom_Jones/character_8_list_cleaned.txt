 - 
                bridget allworthy is the mother of blifil and tom. an unattractive lady who 
resents beautiful women, bridget marries captain blifil because he flatters her 
religious views. although bridget's affection wavers between blifil and tom as 
the boys mature, she becomes devoted to tom before her death--largely due 
to his good looks and gallantry.
