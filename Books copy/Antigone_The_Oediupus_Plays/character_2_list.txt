Antigone - 
                	Child
of Oedipus and Jocasta, and therefore both Oedipus's daughter and
his sister. Antigone appears briefly at the end of Oedipus
the King, when she says goodbye to her father as Creon
prepares to banish Oedipus. She appears at greater length in Oedipus
at Colonus, leading and caring for her old, blind father
in his exile. But Antigone comes into her own in Antigone. As
that play's protagonist, she demonstrates a courage and clarity
of sight unparalleled by any other character in the three Theban
plays. Whereas other characters--Oedipus, Creon, Polynices--are reluctant to
acknowledge the consequences of their actions, Antigone is unabashed
in her conviction that she has done right.

                    in-depth analysis of Antigone.
