none of them answered, but my father, who was one of those hidden among the rocks, came forward down the sloping beach.
he thrust his spear into the sand.
'i am the chief of ghalas-at,' he said. 'my name is chief chowig.'
i was surprised that he gave his teal name to a stranger. everyone in our tribe had two names, the real one which was secret
and was seldom used, and one which was common, for if people use your secret name it becomes worn out and loses its
magic. thus i was known as won-a-pa-lei, which means the girl with the long black hair, though my secret name is 
karana. my father's secret name was chowig. why he gave it to a stranger i do not know.

'mah-nay, won-a-pa-lei,' she said.
'pah-say-no, tutok,' i replied.

then i went to the headland and brought the baskets back to the cave.
tutok came again the next day. we sat on the rock in the bright sun, trading words and laughing. the sun went fast in the

. the time came soon when she had to leave, but she returned on the day that followed. it was on this day, when she was
leaving, that i told her my secret name.

'won-a-pa-lei,' she said, frowning.
