ar as the motion of his head and arm allowed, he surveyed the 
room. two young men -- apparently nephews, one of whom was a high-school 
pupil -- were leaving the room, crossing themselves as they did so. an old 
woman was standing motionless, and a lady with strangely arched eyebrows was 
saying something to her in a whisper. a vigorous, resolute church reader, in a 
frock- coat, was reading something in a loud voice with an expression that 
precluded any contradiction. the butler's assistant, gerasim, stepping lightly in 
front of peter ivanovich, was strewing something on the floor. noticing this, peter 
ivanovich was immediately aware of a faint odor of a decomposing body.  
 
the last time he had called on ivan ilyich, peter ivanovich had seen gerasim in 
the study. ivan ilyich had been particularly fond of him and he was performing the 
duty of a sick nurse.  
 
peter ivanovich continued to make the sign of the cross slightly inclining his head 
in an intermediate direction between the

when he saw peter ivanovich he scowled morosely and shamefacedly. peter 
ivanovich nodded to him and entered the death-chamber. the service began: 
candles, groans, incense, tears, and sobs. peter ivanovich stood looking 
gloomily down at his feet. he did not look once at the dead man, did not yield to 
any depressing influence, and was one of the first to leave the room. there was 
no one in the anteroom, but gerasim darted out of the dead man's room, 
rummaged with his strong hands among the fur coats to find peter ivanovich's 
and helped him on with it.  
 
"well, friend gerasim," said peter ivanovich, so as to say something. "it's a sad 
affair, isn't it?"  
 
"it's god will. we shall all come to it some day," said gerasim, displaying 
his teeth -- the even white teeth of a healthy peasant -- and, like a man in 
the thick of urgent work, he briskly opened the front door, called the

ks. ivan ilyich now watched it with a new and oppressive feeling.  
 
he reached home and began to tell his wife about it. she listened, but in the 
middle of his account his daughter came in with her hat on, ready to go out with 
her mother. she sat down reluctantly to listen to this tedious story, but could not 
stand it long, and her mother too did not hear him to the end.  
 
"well, i am very glad," she said. "mind now to take your medicine regularly. give 
me the prescription and i'll send gerasim to the chemist's." and she went to get 
ready to go out.  
 
while she was in the room ivan ilyich had hardly taken time to breathe, but he 
sighed deeply when she left it.  
 

"well," he thought, "perhaps it isn't so bad after all."  
 
he began taking his medicine and following the doctor's directions, which had 
been altered after the examination of the urine. but then it happened that there 
was a contradiction between the indications drawn from the examination of the 
urine and the sympt

special foods were prepared for him by the doctors' orders, but all those foods 
became increasingly distasteful and disgusting to him.  
 
for his excretions also special arrangements had to be made, and this was a 
torment to him every time -- a torment from the uncleanliness, the unseemliness, 
and the smell, and from knowing that another person had to take part in it.  
 
but just through his most unpleasant matter, ivan ilyich obtained comfort. 
gerasim, the butler's young assistant, always came in to carry the things out. 
gerasim was a clean, fresh peasant lad, grown stout on town food and always 
cheerful and bright. at first the sight of him, in his clean russian peasant 
costume, engaged on that disgusting task embarrassed ivan ilyich.  
 
once when he got up from the commode to weak to draw up his trousers, he 
dropped into a soft armchair and looked with horror at his bare, enfeebled thighs 
with the muscles so sharply marked on them.

gerasim with a firm light tread, his heavy boots emitting a pleasant smell of tar 
and fresh winter air, came in wearing a clean hessian apron, the sleeves of his 
print shirt tucked up over his strong bare young arms; and refraining from looking 
at his sick master out of consideration for his feelings, and restraining the joy of 
life that beamed from his face, he went up to the commode.  
 
"gerasim!" said ivan ilyich in a weak voice.  
 
gerasim started, evidently afraid he might have committed some blunder, and 
with a rapid movement turned his fresh, kind, simple young face which just 
showed the first downy signs of a beard.  
 
"yes, sir?"  
 
"that must be very unpleasant for you. you must forgive me. i am helpless."  
 
"oh, why, sir," and gerasim's eyes beamed and he showed his glistening white 
teeth, "what's a little trouble? it's a case of illness with you, sir."  
 

and his deft strong hands did their accustomed task, and

he went out of the room 
stepping lightly. five minutes later he as lightly returned.  
 
ivan ilyich was still sitting in the same position in the armchair.  
 
"gerasim," he said when the latter had replaced the freshly- washed utensil. 
"please come here and help me." gerasim went up to him. "lift me up. it is hard 
for me to get up, and i have sent dmitri away."  
 
gerasim went up to him, grasped his master with his strong arms deftly but 
gently, in the same way that he stepped -- lifted him, supported him with one 
hand, and with the other drew up his trousers and would have set him down 
again, but ivan ilyich asked to be led to the sofa. gerasim, without an effort and 
without apparent pressure, led him, almost lifting him, to the sofa and placed him 
on it.  
 
"that you. how easily and well you do it all!"  
 
gerasim smiled again and turned to leave the ro

om. but ivan ilyich felt his 
presence such a comfort that he did not want to let him go.  
 
"one thing more, please move up that chair. no, the other one -- under my feet. it 
is easier for me when my feet are raised."  
 
gerasim brought the chair, set it down gently in place, and raised ivan ilyich's 
legs on it. it seemed to ivan ilyich that he felt better while gerasim was holding 
up his legs.  
 
"it's better when my legs are higher," he said. "place that cushion under them."  
 
gerasim did so. he again lifted the legs and placed them, and again ivan ilyich 
felt better while gerasim held his legs. when he set them down ivan ilyich 
fancied he felt worse.  
 
"gerasim," he said. "are you busy now?"  
 
"not at all, sir," said gerasim, who had learnt from the townsfolk how to speak to 
gentlefolk.  
 
"what have you still to do?"  
 
"what have i to do? i've done everything except chopping the logs for 
tomorrow."  
 
"then hold my legs up a bit higher, can you?"

se i can. why not?" and gerasim raised his master's legs higher and 
ivan ilyich thought that in that position he did not feel any pain at all.  
 
"and how about the logs?"  
 
"don't trouble about that, sir. there's plenty of time." ivan ilyich told gerasim to 
sit down and hold his legs, and began to talk to him. and strange to say it 
seemed to him that he felt better while gerasim held his legs up.  
 
after that ivan ilyich would sometimes call gerasim and get him to hold his legs 
on his shoulders, and he liked talking to him. gerasim did it all easily, willingly, 
simply, and with a good nature that touched ivan ilyich. health, strength, and 
vitality in other people were offensive to him, but gerasim's strength and vitality 
did not mortify but soothed him.  
 
what tormented ivan ilyich most was the deception, the lie, which for some 
reason they all accepted, that he was not dying but was simply ill, and the only 
need keep quiet and und

i am dying. then at least stop lying about it!" but he had never had the spirit to 
do it. the awful, terrible act of his dying was, he could see, reduced by those 
about him to the level of a casual, unpleasant, and almost indecorous incident 
(as if someone entered a drawing room defusing an unpleasant odor) and this 
was done by that very decorum which he had served all his life long. he saw that 
no one felt for him, because no one even wished to grasp his position. only 
gerasim recognized it and pitied him. and so ivan ilyich felt at ease only with 
him. he felt comforted when gerasim supported his legs (sometimes all night 
long) and refused to go to bed, saying: "don't you worry, ivan ilyich. i'll get sleep 
enough later on," or when he suddenly became familiar and exclaimed: "if you 
weren't sick it would be another matter, but as it is, why should i grudge a little 
trouble?" gerasim alone did not lie; everything showed that he alone understood

part from this lying, or because of it, what most tormented ivan ilyich was that 
no one pitied him as he wished to be pitied. at certain moments after prolonged 
suffering he wished most of all (though he would have been ashamed to confess 
it) for someone to pity him as a sick child is pitied. he longed to be petted and 
comforted. he knew he was an important functionary, that he had a beard turning 
gray, and that therefore what he long for was impossible, but still he longed for it. 
and in gerasim's attitude towards him there was something akin to what he 
wished for, and so that attitude comforted him. ivan ilyich wanted to weep, 
wanted to be petted and cried over, and then his colleague shebek would come, 
and instead of weeping and being petted, ivan ilyich would assume a serious, 
severe, and profound air, and by force of habit would express his opinion on a 
decision of the court of cassation and would stubbornly insist on that view. this 
falsity around him and within him did more

it was morning. he knew it was morning because gerasim had gone, and peter 
the footman had come and put out the candles, drawn back one of the curtains, 
and begun quietly to tidy up. whether it was morning or evening, friday or 
sunday, made no difference, it was all just the same: the gnawing, unmitigated, 
agonizing pain, never ceasing for an instant, the consciousness of life inexorably 
waning but not yet extinguished, the approach of that ever dreaded and hateful 
death which was the only reality, and always the same falsity. what were days,

had adopted a certain relation to his patient which he could not abandon, so had 
she formed one towards him -- that he was not doing something he ought to do 
and was himself to blame, and that she reproached him lovingly for this -- and 
she could not now change that attitude.  
 
"you see he doesn't listen to me and doesn't take his medicine at the proper 
time. and above all he lies in a position that is no doubt bad for him -- with his 
legs up."  
 
she described how he made gerasim hold his legs up.  
 
the doctor smiled with a contemptuous affability that said: "what's to be done? 
these sick people do have foolish fancies of that kind, but we must forgive 
them."  
 
when the examination was over the doctor looked at his watch, and then 
praskovya fedorovna announced to ivan ilyich that it was of course as he 
pleased, but she had sent today for a celebrated specialist who would examine 
him and have a consultation with michael danilovich (their regular doctor).

tightly drawn on, and was holding his opera hat in his hand.  
 
following him the schoolboy crept in unnoticed, in a new uniform, poor little 
fellow, and wearing gloves. terribly dark shadows showed under his eyes, the 
meaning of which ivan ilyich knew well.  
 
his son had always seemed pathetic to him, and now it was dreadful to see the 
boy's frightened look of pity. it seemed to ivan ilyich that vasya was the only one 
besides gerasim who understood and pitied him.  
 
they all sat down and again asked how he was. a silence followed. lisa asked 
her mother about the opera glasses, and there was an altercation between 
mother and daughter as to who had taken them and where they had been put. 
this occasioned some unpleasantness.  
 
fedor petrovich inquired of ivan ilyich whether he had ever seen sarah 
bernhardt. ivan ilyich did not at first catch the question, but then replied: "no, 
have you seen her before?"

made everything monotonously alike, nothing harder and nothing easier. 
everything was worse.  
 
again minute followed minute and hour followed hour. everything remained the 
same and there was no cessation. and the inevitable end of it all became more 
and more terrible.

his wife returned late at night. she came in on tiptoe, but he heard her, opened 
his eyes, and made haste to close them again. she wished to send gerasim 
away and to sit with him herself, but he opened his eyes and said: "no, go 
away."  
 
"are you in great pain?"

him that he and his pain were being thrust into a narrow, deep black sack, but 
though they were pushed further and further in they could not be pushed to the 
bottom. and this, terrible enough in itself, was accompanied by suffering. he was 
frightened yet wanted to fall through the sack, he struggled but yet co-operated. 
and suddenly he broke through, fell, and regained consciousness. gerasim was 
sitting at the foot of the bed dozing quietly and patiently, while he himself lay with 
his emaciated stockened legs resting on gerasim's shoulders; the same shaded 
candle was there and the same unceasing pain.  

 
"go away, gerasim," he whispered.  
 
"it's all right, sir. i'll stay a while."  
 
"no. go away."

and felt sorry for himself. he only waited till gerasim had gone into the next room

the doctor went into the drawing room and told praskovya fedorovna that the 
case was very serious and that the only resource left was opium to allay her 
husband's sufferings, which must be terrible.  
 
it was true, as the doctor said, that ivan ilyich's physical sufferings were terrible, 
but worse than the physical sufferings were his mental sufferings which were his 
chief torture.  
 
his mental sufferings were due to the fact that that night, as he looked at 
gerasim's sleepy, good-natured face with it prominent cheek-bones, the question 
suddenly occurred to him: "what if my whole life has been wrong?"  
 
it occurred to him that what had appeared perfectly impossible before, namely 
that he had not spent his life as he should have done, might after all be true. it 
occurred to him that his scarcely perceptible attempts to struggle against what 
was considered good by the most highly placed people, those scarcely 
noticeable impulses which he had immediate
