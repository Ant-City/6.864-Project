    what men are you?
  bastard. your faithful subject i, a gentleman
    born in northamptonshire, and eldest son,
    as i suppose, to robert faulconbridge-
    a soldier by the honour-giving hand
    of coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.
  king john. what art thou?
  robert. the son and heir to that same faulconbridge.
  king john. is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
    you came not of one mother then, it seems.
  bastard. most certain of o

    that is well known- and, as i think, one father;
    but for the certain knowledge of that truth
    i put you o'er to heaven and to my mother.
    of that i doubt, as all men's children may.
  elinor. out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother,
    and wound her honour with this diffidence.
  bastard. i, madam? no, i have no reason for it-
    that is my brother's plea, and none of mine;
    the which if he can prove, 'a pops me out
    at least from fair five hundred pound a year.
    heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!
  king john. a good blunt fellow. why, being younger born,
    doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?
  bastard. i know not why, except to get the land.
    but once he slander'd me with bastardy;
    but whe'er i be as true begot or no,

    o old sir robert, father, on my knee
    i give heaven thanks i was not like to thee!
  king john. why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!
  elinor. he hath a trick of coeur-de-lion's face;
    the accent of his tongue affecteth him.
    do you not read some tokens of my son
    in the large composition of this man?
  king john. mine eye hath well examined his parts
    and finds them perfect richard. sirrah, speak,
    what doth move you to claim your brother's land?
  bastard. because he hath a half-face, like my father.
    with half that face would he have all my land:
    a half-fac'd groat five hundred pound a year!
  robert. my gracious liege, when that my father liv'd,
    your brother did employ my father much-
  bastard. well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:
    your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.
  robert. and once dispatch'd him in an embassy
    to germany, there with the emperor
    to treat of high affairs touching that time.

 this son for his?
    in sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
    this calf, bred from his cow, from all the world;
    in sooth, he might; then, if he were my brother's,
    my brother might not claim him; nor your father,
    being none of his, refuse him. this concludes:
    my mother's son did get your father's heir;
    your father's heir must have your father's land.
  robert. shall then my father's will be of no force
    to dispossess that child which is not his?
  bastard. of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
    than was his will to get me, as i think.
  elinor. whether hadst thou rather be a faulconbridge,
    and like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,
    or the reputed son of coeur-de-lion,
    lord of thy presence and no land beside?
  bastard. madam, an if my brother had my shape
    and i had his, sir robert's his, like him;
    and if my legs were two such riding-rods,
    my arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin
    that in mine ear i

    i would give it every foot to have this face!
    i would not be sir nob in any case.
  elinor. i like thee well. wilt thou forsake thy fortune,
    bequeath thy land to him and follow me?
    i am a soldier and now bound to france.
  bastard. brother, take you my land, i'll take my chance.
    your face hath got five hundred pound a year,
    yet sell your face for fivepence and 'tis dear.
    madam, i'll follow you unto the death.
  elinor. nay, i would have you go before me thither.
  bastard. our country manners give our betters way.
  king john. what is thy name?
  bastard. philip, my liege, so is my name begun:

    at your employment, at your service, sir!'
    'no, sir,' says question 'i, sweet sir, at yours.'
    and so, ere answer knows what question would,
    saving in dialogue of compliment,
    and talking of the alps and apennines,
    the pyrenean and the river po-
    it draws toward supper in conclusion so.
    but this is worshipful society,
    and fits the mounting spirit like myself;
    for he is but a bastard to the time
    that doth not smack of observation-
    and so am i, whether i smack or no;
    and not alone in habit and device,
    exterior form, outward accoutrement,
    but from the inward motion to deliver
    sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth;
    which, though i will not practise to deceive,
    yet, to avoid deceit, i mean to learn;
    for it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
    but who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
    what woman-post is this?

    to whom am i beholding for these limbs?
    sir robert never holp to make this leg.

    what! i am dubb'd; i have it on my shoulder.
    but, mother, i am not sir robert's son:
    i have disclaim'd sir robert and my land;
    legitimation, name, and all is gone.
    then, good my mother, let me know my father-

    rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,

ar mother england, blush for shame;
    for your own ladies and pale-visag'd maids,
    like amazons, come tripping after drums,
    their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,
    their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts
    to fierce and bloody inclination.
  lewis. there end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;
    we grant thou canst outscold us. fare thee well;
    we hold our time too precious to be spent
    with such a brabbler.
  pandulph. give me leave to speak.
  bastard. no, i will speak.
  lewis. we will attend to neither.
    strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war,
    plead for our interest and our being here.
  bastard. indeed, your drums, being beaten, will cry out;
    and so shall you, being beaten. do but start
    and echo with the clamour of thy drum,
    and even at hand a drum is ready brac'd
    that shall reverberate all as loud as thine:
    sound but another, and another shall,
    as loud as thine, rattle the welkin's ear

    a bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
    to feast upon whole thousands of the french.

  bastard. hubert, i think.
  hubert. thou hast a perfect thought.

    thou art my friend that know'st my tongue so well.

    that any accent breaking from thy tongue
    should scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.

  hubert. why, here walk i in the black brow of night
    to find you out.

  hubert. o, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,
    black, fearful, comfortless, and horrible.
  bastard. show me the very wound of this ill news;
    i am no woman, i'll not swoon at it.
  hubert. the king, i fear, is poison'd by a monk;
    i left him almost speechless and broke out
    to acquaint you with this evil, that you might

    than if you had at leisure known of this.

  hubert. a monk, i tell you; a resolved villain,
    whose bowels suddenly burst out. the king
    yet speaks, and peradventure may recover.
  bastard. who didst thou leave to tend his majesty?
  hubert. why, know you not? the lords are all come back,
    and brought prince henry in their company;
    at whose request the king hath pardon'd them,
    and they are all about his majesty.
  bastard. withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,
    and tempt us not to bear above our power!
    i'll tell thee, hubert, half my power this night,
    passing these flats, are taken by the tide-
    these lincoln washes have devoured them;
    myself, well-mounted, hardly have escap'd.
