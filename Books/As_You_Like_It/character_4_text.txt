enter rosalind and celia


  celia. i pray thee, rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.

  rosalind. dear celia, i show more mirth than i am mistress of; and
    would you yet i were merrier? unless you could teach me to forget
    a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any
    extraordinary pleasure.

  celia. herein i see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that i
    love thee. if my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy
    uncle, the duke my father, so thou hadst been still with

 me,
    i could have taught my love to take thy father for mine; so wouldst
    thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously temper'd
    as mine is to thee.

  rosalind. well, i will forget the condition of my estate, to
    rejoice in yours.

  celia. you know my father hath no child but i, nor none is like to
    have; and, truly, when he dies thou shalt be his heir; for what
    he hath taken away from thy father perforce, i will render thee
    again in affection. by mine honour, i will; and when i break that
    oath, let me turn monster; therefore, my sweet rose, my dear
    rose, be merry.

  rosalind. from henceforth i will, coz, and devise sports.
    let me see; what think you of falling in love?

  celia. marry, i prithe

    of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again.

  rosalind. what shall be our sport, then?

  celia. let us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from her
    wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.

  rosalind. i would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily
    misplaced; and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her
    gifts to women.

  celia. 'tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes
    honest; and those that she makes honest she makes very
    ill-favouredly.

  rosalind. nay; now thou goest from fortune's office to nature'

    fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of
    nature.

  celia. no; when nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by
    fortune fall into the fire? though nature hath given us wit to
    flout at fortune, hath not fortune sent in this fool to cut off
    the argument?

  rosalind. indeed, there is fortune too hard for nature, when
    fortune makes nature's natural the cutter-off of nature's wit.

  celia. peradventure this is not fortune's work neither, but
    nature's, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of
    such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for
    always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits.
    how now, wit! whither wander you?

  touchstone. mistress, you must come away to your father.

  celia. were you made the messenger?

  touchstone. no, by mine honour; but i was bid to come for you.

    now i'll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard
    was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.

  celia. how prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge?

  rosalind. ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.

  touchstone. stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear
    by your beards that i am a knave.

  celia. by our beards, if we had them, thou art.

  touchstone. by my knavery, if i had it, then i were. but if you
    swear by that that not, you are not forsworn; no more was this
    knight, swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he

  celia. prithee, who is't that thou mean'st?

  touchstone. one that old frederick, your father, loves.

  celia. my father's love is enough to honour him. enough, speak no
    more of him; you'll be whipt for taxation one of these days.

  touchstone. the more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise
    men do foolishly.

  celia. by my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit that
    fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have
    makes a great show. here comes monsieur le beau.

                           enter le beau


  rosalind. with his mouth full of news.

  celia. which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.

  rosalind. then shall we be news-cramm'd.

  celia. all the better; we shall be the more marketable. bon jour,
    monsieur le beau. what's the news?

  le beau. fair princess, you have lost much good sport.

  celia. sport! of what colour?

  le beau. what colour, madam? how shall i answer you?

  rosalind. as wit and fortune will.

  touchstone. or as the destinies decrees.

  celia. well said; that was laid on with a trowel.

  touchstone. nay, if i keep not my rank-

  rosalind. thou losest thy old smell.

  le beau. you amaze me, ladies. i would have told you of good
    wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.

  rosalind. yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.

  le beau. i will tell you the beginning, and, if it please your
    ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is yet to do; and
    here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.

  celia. well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.

  le beau. there comes an old man and his three sons-

  celia. i could match this beginning with an old tale.

  le beau. three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.

  rosalind. with bills on their necks: 'be it known unto all men by
    these presents'-

  le beau. the eldest of the three wrestled with charles, the duke's
    wrestler; which charles in a moment threw him, and broke three of
    his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him. so he serv'd
    the second, and so the third. yonder they lie; the poor old man,

    beholders take his part with weeping.

  rosalind. alas!

  touchstone. but what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have
    lost?

  le beau. why, this that i speak of.

  touchstone. thus men may grow wiser every day. it is the first time
    that ever i heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.

  celia. or i, i promise thee.

  rosalind. but is there any else longs to see this broken music in
    his sides? is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking?
    shall we see this wrestling, cousin?

  le beau. you must, if you stay here; for here is the place
    appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.

  celia. yonder, sure, they are coming. let us now stay and see it.

  frederick. how now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither to
    see the wrestling?

  rosalind. ay, my liege; so please you give us leave.

  frederick. you will take little delight in it, i can tell you,

    there is such odds in the man. in pity of the challenger's youth
    i would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated.

  celia. young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years.
    you have seen cruel proof of this man's strength; if you saw
    yourself with your eyes, or knew yourself with your judgment, the
    fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal
    enterprise. we pray you, for your own sake, to embrace your own

    but at this hour the house doth keep itself;
    there's none within.

  oliver. if that an eye may profit by a tongue,
    then should i know you by description-
    such garments, and such years: 'the boy is fair,
    of female favour, and bestows himself
    like a ripe sister; the woman low,
    and browner than her brother.' a

re not you
    the owner of the house i did inquire for?

  celia. it is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.

  oliver. orlando doth commend him to you both;
    and to that youth he calls his rosalind
    he sends this bloody napkin. are you he?

  rosalind. i am. what must we understand by this?

  oliver. some of my shame; if you will know of me
    what man i am, and how, and why, and where,
    this handkercher was stain'd.

  celia. i pray you, tell it.

  oliver. when last the young orlando parted from you,
    he left a promise to return again
    within an hour; and, pacing through the forest,
    chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
    lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,
    and mark what object did present itself.
    under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age,
    and high top bald with dry antiquity,
    a wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
    lay sleeping on his back. about his

 his mouth; but suddenly,
    seeing orlando, it unlink'd itself,
    and with indented glides did slip away
    into a bush; under which bush's shade
    a lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
    lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,
    when that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
    the royal disposition of that beast
    to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.
    this seen, orlando did approach the man,
    and found it was his brother, his elder brother.

  celia. o, i have heard him speak of that same brother;
    and he did render him the most unnatural
    that liv'd amongst men.

  oliver. and well he might so do,
    for well i know he was unnatural.

  rosalind. but, to orlando: did he leave him there,
    food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?

  oliver. twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;
    but kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
    and nature, stronger than his just occasion,
    made him give battle to the lioness,

  who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling
    from miserable slumber i awak'd.

  celia. are you his brother?

  rosalind. was't you he rescu'd?

  celia. was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?

  oliver. 'twas i; but 'tis not i. i do not shame
    to tell you what i was, since my conversion
    so sweetly tastes, being the thing i am.

  rosalind. but for the bloody napkin?

  oliver. by and by.
    when from the first to last, betwixt us two,
    tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd,
    as how i came into that desert place-
    in brief, he led me to the gentle duke,
    who gave me fresh array and entertainment

 all this while had bled; and now he fainted,
    and cried, in fainting, upon rosalind.
    brief, i recover'd him, bound up his wound,
    and, after some small space, being strong at heart,
    he sent me hither, stranger as i am,
    to tell this story, that you might excuse
    his broken promise, and to give this napkin,
    dy'd in his blood, unto the shepherd youth
    that he in sport doth call his rosalind.

  celia. why, how now, ganymede! sweet ganymede!

  oliver. many will swoon when they do look on blood.

  celia. there is more in it. cousin ganymede!

  oliver. look, he recovers.

  rosalind. i would i were at home.

  celia. we'll lead you thither.
    i pray you, will you take him by the arm?

  oliver. be of good cheer, youth. you a man!
    you lack a man's heart.

  rosalind. i do so, i confess it. ah, sirrah, a body would think
    this was well counterfeited. i pray you tell

your brother how
    well i counterfeited. heigh-ho!

  oliver. this was not counterfeit; there is too great testimony in
    your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.

  rosalind. counterfeit, i assure you.

  oliver. well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.

  rosalind. so i do; but, i' faith, i should have been a woman by
    right.

  celia. come, you look paler and paler; pray you draw homewards.
    good sir, go with us.

  oliver. that will i, for i must bear answer back
    how you excuse my brother, rosalind.

  rosalind. i shall devise something; but, i pray you, commend my
    counterfeiting to him. will you go?                   exeunt

  duke senior. dost thou believe, orlando, that the boy
    can do all this that he hath promised?

  orlando. i sometimes do believe and sometimes do not:
    as those that fear they hope, and know they fear.

    you say, if i bring in your rosalind,
    you will bestow her on orlando here?

o have her and death were both one thing.

  rosalind. i have promis'd to make all this matter even.
    keep you your word, o duke, to give your daughter;
    you yours, orlando, to receive his daughter;
    keep your word, phebe, that you'll marry me,
    or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd;
    keep your word, silvius, that you'll marry her
    if she refuse me; and from hence i go,
    to make these doubts all even.

  duke senior. i do remember in this shepherd boy
    some lively touches of my daughter's favour.

  orlando. my lord, the first time that i ever saw him
    methought he was a brother to your daughter.
    but, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
    and hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
    of many desperate studies by his uncle,
    whom he reports to be a great magician,
    obscured in the circle of this forest.

ot take up a quarrel; but when the parties were
    met themselves, one of them thought but of an if, as: 'if you
    said so, then i said so.' and they shook hands, and swore
    brothers. your if is the only peace-maker; much virtue in if.

  jaques. is not this a rare fellow, my lord?
    he's as good at any thing, and yet a fool.

  duke senior. he uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the
    presentation of that he shoots his wit:

              when earthly things made even
                atone together.
              good duke, receive thy daughter;
              hymen from heaven brought her,
                yea, brought her hither,
              that thou mightst join her hand with his,
              whose heart within his bosom is.
