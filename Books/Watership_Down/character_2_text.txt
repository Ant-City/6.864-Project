l and fiver went a short way above ground and then into a
wide, open hole in a sand patch and so down, by various runs, until they were
thirty feet into the wood, among the roots of an oak. here they were stopped by a
large, heavily built rabbit -- one of the owsla. he had a curious, heavy growth of
fur on the crown of his head, which gave him an odd appearance, as though he
were wearing a kind of cap. this had given him his name, thlayli, which means,
literally, "furhead" or, as we might say, "bigwig."
     "hazel?" said bigwig, sniffing at him in the deep twilight among the tree roots.
"it is hazel, isn't it? what are you doing here? and at this time of day?" he
ignored fiver, who was waiting further down the run.
     "we want to see the chief rabbit," said hazel. "it's important, bigwig. can you
help us?"
     "we?" said bigwig. "is he going to see him, too?"
     "yes, he must. do trust me, bigwig. i don't usually come and talk like this, do
i? when did i ever ask to see the chief rabbi

t before?"
     "well, i'll do it for you, hazel, although i'll probably get my head bitten off. i'll
tell him i know you're a sensible fellow. he ought to know you himself, of course,
but he's getting old. wait here, will you?"
     bigwig went a little way down the run and stopped at the entrance to a large
burrow. after speaking a few words that hazel could not catch, he was evidently
called inside. the two rabbits waited in silence, broken only by the continual
nervous fidgeting of fiver.
     the chief rabbit's name and style was threarah, meaning "lord rowan tree."
for some reason he was always referred to as "the threarah" -- perhaps because
there happened to be only one threar, or rowan, near the warren, from which he

e had coolly -- some even said
coldly -- stood firm during the terrible onslaught of the myxomatosis, ruthlessly
driving out every rabbit who seemed to be sickening. he had resisted all ideas of
mass emigration and enforced complete isolation on the warren, thereby almost
certainly saving it from extinction. it was he, too, who had once dealt with a
particularly troublesome stoat by leading it down among the pheasant coops and
so (at the risk of his own life) onto a keeper's gun. he was now, as bigwig said,
getting old, but his wits were still clear enough. when hazel and fiver were
brought in, he greeted them politely. owsla like toadflax might threaten and
bully. the threarah had no need.
     "ah, walnut. it is walnut, isn't it?"
     "hazel," said hazel.
     "hazel, of course. how very nice of you to come and see me. i knew your
mother well. and your friend--"
     "my brother."
     "your brother," said the threarah, with the faintest suggestion of "don't

snare. hazel held him
down with both forepaws and he grew quieter.
     "i'm awfully sorry, chief rabbit," said hazel. "he gets like this sometimes.
he'll be all right in a minute."
     "what a shame! what a shame! poor fellow, perhaps he ought to go home and
rest. yes, you'd better take him along now. well, it's really been extremely good of
you to come and see me, walnut. i appreciate it very much indeed. and i shall

think over all you've said most carefully, you can be quite sure of that. bigwig,
just wait a moment, will you?"
     as hazel and fiver made their way dejectedly down the run outside the
threarah's burrow, they could just hear, from inside, the chief rabbit's voice
assuming a rather sharper note, interspersed with an occasional "yes, sir," "no,
sir."
     bigwig, as he had predicted, was getting his head bitten off.

hazel. "i'd never been near the chief
rabbit before. but i thought, 'well, even if he won't listen, at least no one can say
afterward that we didn't do our best to warn him.'"
     "you're sure, then, that there's really something to be afraid of?"
     "i'm quite certain. i've always known fiver, you see."
     blackberry was about to reply when another rabbit came noisily through the
thick dog's mercury in the wood, blundered down into the brambles and pushed
his way up from the ditch. it was bigwig.
     "hello, bigwig," said hazel. "you're off duty?"
     "off duty" said bigwig, "and likely to remain off duty."
     "how do you mean?"
     "i've left the owsla, that's what i mean."
     "not on our account?"
     "you could say that. the threarah's rather good at making himself unpleasant
when he's been woken up at ni-frith for what he considers a piece of trivial
nonsense. he certainly knows how to get under your skin. i dare say a good many
rabbits would have kept quiet and thought abo

chief, but i'm afraid i'm not much good at that. i told him that the owsla's
privileges didn't mean all that much to me in any case and that a strong rabbit
could always do just as well by leaving the warren. he told me not to be impulsive
and think it over, but i shan't stay. lettuce-stealing isn't my idea of a jolly life, nor
sentry duty in the burrow. i'm in a fine temper, i can tell you."
     "no one will steal lettuces soon," said fiver quietly.

     "oh, that's you, fiver, is it?" said bigwig, noticing him for the first time. "good,
i was coming to look for you. i've been thinking about what you said to the chief
rabbit. tell me, is it a sort of tremendous hoax to make yourself important, or is
it true?"
     "it is true," said fiver. "i wish it weren't."
     "then you'll be leaving the warren?"
     they were all startled by the bluntness with which bigwig went to the point.
dandelion muttered, "leave the warren, frithrah!" while blackberry twitched his
ears and looked very intent

ly, first at bigwig and then at hazel.
     it was hazel who replied. "fiver and i will be leaving the warren tonight," he
said deliberately. "i don't know exactly where we shall go, but we'll take anyone
who's ready to come with us."
     "right," said bigwig, "then you can take me."
     the last thing hazel had expected was the immediate support of a member of
the owsla. it crossed his mind that although bigwig would certainly be a useful
rabbit in a tight corner, he would also be a difficult one to get on with. he
certainly would not want to do what he was told -- or even asked -- by an
outskirter. "i don't care if he is in the owsla," thought hazel. "if we get away from
the warren, i'm not going to let bigwig run everything, or why bother to go?" but
he answered only, "good. we shall be glad to have you."
     he looked round at the other rabbits, who were all staring either at bigwig or
at himself.

er
in the middle, begone dull care!"
     he pulled out a burnet leaf and ate it slowly, concealing his fear as best he
could; for all his instincts were warning him of the dangers in the unknown
country beyond the warren.
     "if we believe fiver," said hazel, "it means that we think no rabbits at all ought
to stay here. so between now and the time when we go, we ought to persuade as
many as we can to join us."
     "i think there are one or two in the owsla who might be worth sounding," said
bigwig. "if i can talk them over, they'll be with me when i join you tonight. but
they won't come because of fiver. they'll be juniors, discontented fellows like me.
you need to have heard fiver yourself to be convinced by him. he's convinced
me. it's obvious that he's been sent some kind of message, and i believe in these
things. i can't think why he didn't convince the threarah."
     "because the threarah doesn't like anything he hasn't thought of for himself,"
answered hazel. "but we can't bother

too: we can't wait longer. the danger's coming closer all the time -- whatever it is
-- and, besides, the threarah isn't going to like it if he finds out that you've been
trying to get at rabbits in the owsla, bigwig. neither is captain holly, i dare say.
they won't mind odds and ends like us clearing off, but they won't want to lose
you. if i were in your place, i'd be careful whom i picked to talk to."

'm hawkbit," said the rabbit who was peering over the edge. he jumped
down among them, landing rather heavily. "do you remember me, hazel? we

were in the same burrow during the snow last winter. dandelion told me you
were going to leave the warren tonight. if you are, i'll come with you."
     hazel could recall hawkbit -- a rather slow, stupid rabbit whose company for
five snowbound days underground had been distinctly tedious. still, he thought,
this was no time to pick and choose. although bigwig might succeed in talking
over one or two, most of the rabbits they could expect to join them would not
come from the owsla. they would be outskirters who were getting a thin time
and wondering what to do about it. he was running over some of these in his
mind when dandelion appeared.
     "the sooner we're off the better, i reckon," said dandelion. "i don't much like
the look of things. after i'd persuaded hawkbit here to join us, i was just starting
to talk to a few more, when i found that toa

rass. at last, just as hazel was about to run down the slope to
blackberry's burrow, he saw him come out of his hole, followed by no less than
three rabbits. one of these, buckthorn, hazel knew well. he was glad to see him,
for he knew him for a tough, sturdy fellow who was considered certain to get into
the owsla as soon as he reached full weight.
     "but i dare say he's impatient," thought hazel, "or he may have come off worst
in some scuffle over a doe and taken it hard. well, with him and bigwig, at least
we shan't be too badly off if we run into any fighting."
     he did not recognize the other two rabbits and when blackberry told him their
names -- speedwell and acorn -- he was none the wiser. but this was not
surprising, for they were typical outskirters -- thin-looking six-monthers, with the
strained, wary look of those who are only too well used to the thin end of the
stick. they looked curiously at fiver. from what blackberry had told them, they
had been almost expecting to find

instead, he seemed more calm and normal than the rest. the certainty of going
had lifted a weight from fiver.
     more time went slowly by. blackberry scrambled up into the fern and then
returned to the top of the bank, fidgeting nervously and half inclined to bolt at
nothing. hazel and fiver remained in the ditch, nibbling halfheartedly at the dark
grass. at last hazel heard what he was listening for; a rabbit -- or was it two? --
approaching from the wood.
     a few moments later bigwig was in the ditch. behind him came a hefty, brisk-
looking rabbit something over twelve months old. he was well known by sight to
all the warren, for his fur was entirely gray, with patches of near-white that now
caught the moonlight as he sat scratching himself without speaking. this was

silver, a nephew of the threarah, who was serving his first month in the owsla.
     hazel could not help feeling relieved that bigwig had brought only silver -- a
quiet, straightforward fellow who had not ye

t really found his feet among the
veterans. when bigwig had spoken earlier of sounding out the owsla, hazel had
been in two minds. it was only too likely that they would encounter dangers
beyond the warren and that they would stand in need of some good fighters.
again, if fiver was right and the whole warren was in imminent peril, then of
course they ought to welcome any rabbit who was ready to join them. on the
other hand, there seemed no point in taking particular pains to get hold of rabbits
who were going to behave like toadflax.
     "wherever

we settle down in the end," thought hazel, "i'm determined to see
that pipkin and fiver aren't sat on and cuffed around until they're ready to run
any risk just to get away. but is bigwig going to see it like that?"
     "you know silver, don't you?" asked bigwig, breaking in on his thoughts.
"apparently some of the younger fellows in the owsla have been giving him a thin
time -- teasing him about his fur, you know, and saying he only got his place
because of the threarah. i thought i was going to get some more, but i suppose
nearly all the owsla feel they're very well off as they are."
     he looked about him. "i say, there aren't many here, are there? do you think
it's really worth going on with this idea?"
     silver seemed about to speak when sudd

rowth above and three more rabbits came over the bank from the wood.
their movement was direct and purposeful, quite unlike the earlier, haphazard
approach of those who were now gathered in the ditch. the largest of the three
newcomers was in front and the other two followed him, as though under orders.
hazel, sensing at once that they had nothing in common with himself and his
companions, started and sat up tensely. fiver muttered in his ear, "oh, hazel,
they've come to--" but broke off short. bigwig turned toward them and stared, his
nose working rapidly. the three came straight up to him.
     "thlayli?" said the leader.
     "you know me perfectly well," replied bigwig, "and i know you, holly. what do
you want?"
     "you're under arrest."
     "under arrest? what do you mean? what for?"
     "spreading dissension and inciting to mutiny. silver, you're under arrest too,
for failing to report to toadflax this evening and causing your duty to devolve on
a comrade. you're both to come with

me."
     immediately bigwig fell upon him, scratching and kicking. holly fought back.
his followers closed in, looking for an opening to join the fight and pin bigwig
down. suddenly, from the top of the bank, buckthorn flung himself headlong into
the scuffle, knocked one of the guards flying with a kick from his back legs and
then closed with the other. he was followed a moment later by dandelion, who
landed full on the rabbit whom buckthorn had kicked. both guards broke clear,
looked round for a moment and then leaped up the bank into the wood. holly
struggled free of bigwig and crouched on his haunches, scuffling his front paws
and growling, as rabbits wil

the wood.
     dandelion was bleeding from the shoulder. he licked the wound for a few
moments and then turned to hazel.
     "they won't be long coming back, you know, hazel," he said. "they've gone to
turn out the owsla, and then we'll be for it right enough."
     "we ought to go at once," said fiver.
     "yes, the time's come now, all right," replied hazel. "come on, down to the
stream. then we'll follow the bank -- that'll help us to keep together."
     "if you'll take my advice--" began bigwig.
     "if we stay here any longer i shan't be able to," answered hazel.
     with fiver beside him, he led the way out of the ditch and down the slope. in
less than a minute the little band of rabbits had disappeared into the dim,
moonlit night.

5.     in the woods

     these young rabbits... must move out if they are to survive. in a wild and free
state they... stray sometimes for miles... wandering until they find a suitable
environment.

its avoid close woodland, where the ground is shady, damp and grassless
and they feel menaced by the undergrowth. hazel did not care for the look of the
trees. still, he thought, holly would no doubt think twice before following them
into a place like that, and to keep beside the brook might well prove safer than
wandering about the fields in one direction and another, with the risk of finding
themselves, in the end, back at the warren. he decided to go straight into the
wood without consulting bigwig, and to trust that the rest would follow.
     "if we don't run into any trouble and the brook takes us through the wood," he
thought, "we really shall be clear of the warren and then we can look for
somewhere to rest for a bit. most of them still seem to be more or less all right,
but fiver and pipkin will have had as much as they can stand before long."
     from the moment he entered it, the wood seemed full of noises. there was a

smell of damp leaves and moss, and everywhere the splash of

little, it drifted to the bank and el-ahrairah dragged it out and waited a while
before pushing it in again. after an hour of this, the pike left it alone, and when it
had done so for the fifth time, el-ahrairah swam across himself and went home.
some rabbits say he controls the weather, because the wind, the damp and the

dew are friends and instruments to rabbits against their enemies.
     "hazel, we'll have to stop here," said bigwig, coming up between the panting,
crouching bodies of the others. "i know it's not a good place, but fiver and this
other half-sized fellow you've got here -- they're pretty well all in. they won't be
able to go on if we don't rest."
     the truth was that every one of them was tired. many rabbits spend all their
lives in the same place and never run more than a hundred yards at a stretch.
even though they may live and sleep above ground for months at a time, they
prefer not to be out of distanc

 the rabbit were friends and they
both ate grass. and there was plenty of grass and plenty of flies, because the
world was new and frith shone down bright and warm all day.
     "now, el-ahrairah was among the animals in those days and he had many
wives. he had so many wives that there was no counting them, and the wives had
so many young that even frith could not count them, and they ate the grass and
the dandelions and the lettuces and the clover, and el-ahrairah was the father of
them all." (bigwig growled appreciatively.) "and after a time," went on
dandelion, "after a time the grass began to grow thin and the rabbits wandered
everywhere, multiplying and eating as they went.
     "then frith said to el-ahrairah, 'prince rabbit, if you cannot control your
people, i shall find ways to control them. so mark what i say.' but el-ahrairah
would not listen and he said to frith, 'my people are the strongest in the world,
for they breed faster and eat more than any of the other people. and this s

se to the ground. behind, they could
just discern great, powerful paws and a shaggy black body. the eyes were peering
at them, full of savage cunning. the head moved slowly, taking in the dusky
lengths of the wood ride in both directions, and then fixed them once more with
its fierce, terrible stare. the jaws opened wider and they could see the teeth,
glimmering white as the stripes along the head. for long moments it gazed and
the rabbits remained motionless, staring back without a sound. then bigwig, who
was nearest to the path, turned and slipped back among the others.
     "a lendri," he muttered as he passed through them. "it may be dangerous and
it may not, but i'm taking no chances with it. let's get away."
     they followed him through the fern and very soon came upon another, parallel
path. bigwig turned into it and broke into a run. dandelion overtook him and the
two disappeared among the ilex trees. hazel and the others followed as best they
could, with pipkin limping and stagger

ing behind, his fear driving him on in spite
of the pain in his paw.
     hazel came out on the further side of the ilexes and followed the path round a
bend. then he stopped dead and sat back on his haunches. immediately in front
of him, bigwig and dandelion were staring out from the sheer edge of a high
bank, and below the bank ran a stream. it was in fact the little river enborne,
twelve to fifteen feet wide and at this time of year two or three feet deep with
spring rain, but to the rabbits it seemed immense, such a river as they had never
imagined. the moon had almost set and the night was now dark, but they could
see the water faintly shining as it flowed and could just make out, on the further
side, a thin belt of nut trees and

alders. somewhere beyond, a plover called three
or four times and was silent.
     one by one, most of the others came up, stopped at the bank and looked at the
water without speaking. a chilly breeze was moving and several of them trembled
where they sat.
     "well, this is a nice surprise, hazel," said bigwig at length. "or were you
expecting this when you took us into the wood?"
     hazel realized wearily that bigwig was probably going to be troublesome. he
was certainly no coward, but he was likely to remain steady only as long as he
could see his way clear and be sure of what to do. to him, perplexity was worse
than danger; and when he was perplexed he usually grew angry. the day before,
fiver's warning had troubled him, and he had spoken in anger to the threarah
and left the owsla. then, while he was in an uncertain mood about the idea of
leaving the warren, captain holly had appeared in capital time to 
 
 ___________________________
 
be attacked and
to provide a perfect reason for their departure. now, at the sight of the river,
bigwig's assurance was leaking again and unless he, hazel, could restore it in
some way, they were likely to be in for trouble. he thought of the threarah and
his wily courtesy.
     "i don't know what we should have done without you just now, bigwig," he

said. "what was that animal? would it have killed us?"
     "a lendri," said bigwig. "i've heard about them in the owsla. they're not really
dangerous. they can't catch a rabbit that runs, and nearly always you can smell
them coming. they're funny things: i've heard of rabbits living almost on top of
them and coming to no harm. but they're best avoided, all the same. they'll dig
out rabbit kittens and they'll kill an injured rabbit if they find one. they're one of
the thousand, all right. i ought to have guessed from the smell, but it was new to
me."
     "it had killed before

 it met us," said blackberry with a shudder. "i saw the
blood on its lips."
     "a rat, perhaps, or pheasant chicks. lucky for us it had killed, otherwise it
might have been quicker. still, fortunately we did the right thing. we really came
out of it very well," said bigwig.
     fiver came limping down the path with pipkin. they, too, checked and stared
at the sight of the river.
     "what do you think we ought to do now, fiver?" asked hazel.
     fiver looked down at the water and twitched his ears.
     "we shall have to cross it," he said. "but i don't think i can swim, hazel. i'm
worn out, and pipkin's a good deal worse than i am."
     "cross it?" cried bigwig. "cross it? who's going to cross it? what do you want
to cross it for? i never heard such nonsense

he top -- on the top and in the
open."
     "but, fiver, i think they may refuse to go much further. and then again, you
say all this and yet you say you're too tired to swim?"
     "i can rest, hazel, but pipkin's in a pretty bad way. i think he's injured. we
may have to stay here half the day."
     "well, let's go and talk to the others. they may not mind staying. it's crossing
they're not going to fancy, unless something frightens them into it."
     as soon as they had made their way back, bigwig came across to them from the
bushes at the edge of the path.
     "i was wondering where you'd got to," he said to hazel. "are you ready to move
on?"
     "no, i'm not," answered hazel firmly. "i think we ought to stay here until ni-

frith. that'll give everyone a chance to rest and then we can swim across to those
fields."
     bigwig was about to reply, but blackberry spoke first.
     "bigwig," he said, "why don't you swim over now, and then go out into the field
and have a look round? the

 wood may not stretch very far one way or the other.
you could see from there; and then we might know which would be the best way
to go."
     "oh, well," said bigwig rather grudgingly, "i suppose there's some sense in
that. i'll swim the embleer* river as many times as you like. always glad to
oblige."
     without the slightest hesitation, he took two hops to the water, waded in and
swam across the deep, still pool. they watched him pull himself out beside a
flowering clump of figwort, gripping one of the tough stems in his teeth, shake a
shower of drops out of his fur and scutter into the alder bushes. a moment later,
between the nut trees, they saw him r

unning off into the field.
     "i'm glad he's with us," said hazel to silver. again he thought wryly of the
threarah. "he's the fellow to find out all we need to know. oh, i say, look, he's
coming back already."
     bigwig was racing back across the field, looking more agitated than he had at
any time since the encounter with captain holly. he ran into the water almost
headlong and paddled over fast, leaving an arrowhead ripple on the calm brown
surface. he was speaking as he jerked himself out on the sandy foreshore.
     "well, hazel, if i were you i shouldn't wait until ni-frith. i should go now. in
fact, i think you'll have to."
     "why?" asked hazel.
     "there's a large dog loose in the wood."
     hazel

said. "how do you know?"
     "when you get into the field you can see the wood sloping down to the river.
parts of it are open. i saw the dog crossing a clearing. it was trailing a chain, so it
must have broken loose. it may be on the lendri's scent, but the lendri will be
underground by now. what do you think will happen when it picks up our scent,
running from one side of the wood to the other, with dew on it? come on, let's get
over quickly,"
     hazel felt at a loss. in front of him stood bigwig, sodden wet, undaunted,
single-minded -- the very picture of decision. at his shoulder was fiver, silent and
twitching. he saw blackberry watching him intently, waiting for his lead and
disregarding bigwig's. then he looked at pipkin, huddled into a fold of sand,
more panic-stricken and helpless than any rabbit he had ever seen. at this
moment, up in the wood, there broke out an excited yelping and a jay began to
scold.
     hazel spoke through a kind of light-headed trance. "well, you'd better

 get on,
then," he said, "and anyone else who wants to. personally, i'm going to wait until
fiver and pipkin are fit to tackle it."
     "you silly blockhead!" cried bigwig. "we'll all be finished! we'll--"
     "don't stamp about," said hazel, "you may be heard. what do you suggest,
then?"
     "suggest? there's no suggesting to be done. those who can swim, swim. the

others will have to stay here and hope for the best. the dog may not come."
     "i'm afraid that won't do for me. i got pipkin into this and i'm going to get him
out."
     "well, you didn't get fiver into it, did you? he got you into it."
     hazel could not help noticing, with reluctant admirat

had lost his temper, he was apparently in no hurry on his own account and
seemed less frightened than any of them. looking round for blackberry, he saw
that he had left them and was up at the top of the pool, where the narrow beach
tailed away into a gravel spit. his paws were half buried in the wet gravel and he
was nosing at something large and flat on the waterline. it looked like a piece of
wood.
     "blackberry," he said, "can you come back here a moment?"
     blackberry looked up, tugge

d out his paws and ran back.
     "hazel," he said quickly, "that's a piece of flat wood -- like that piece that closed
the gap by the green loose above the warren -- you remember? it must have
drifted down the river. so it floats. we could put fiver and pipkin on it and make
it float again. it might go across the river. can you understand?"
     hazel had no idea what he meant. blackberry's flood of apparent nonsense
only seemed to draw tighter the mesh of danger and bewilderment. as though
bigwig's angry impatience, pipkin's terror and the approaching dog were not
enough to contend with, the cleverest rabbit among them had evidently gone out
of his mind. he felt close to despair.
     "frithrah, yes, i see!" said an excited voice at his ear. it was fiver. "quick,
hazel, don't wait! come on, and bring pipkin!"
     it was blackberry who bullied the stupefied pipkin to his feet and forced him to
limp the few yards to the gravel spit. the piece of wood, hardly bigger than a large
rhubarb l

eaf, was lightly aground. blackberry almost drove pipkin onto it with his
claws. pipkin crouched shivering and fiver followed him aboard.
     "who's strong?" said blackberry. "bigwig! silver! push it out!"
     no one obeyed him. all squatted, puzzled and uncertain. blackberry buried his
nose in the gravel under the landward edge of the board and raised it, pushing.
the board tipped. pipkin squealed and fiver lowered his head and splayed his
claws. then the board righted itself and drifted out a few feet into the pool with
the two rabbits hunched upon it, rigid and motionless. it rotated slowly and they
found themselves staring back at their comrades.
     "frith and inlé!

" said dandelion. "they're sitting on the water! why don't they
sink?"
     "they're sitting on the wood and the wood floats, can't you see?" said
blackberry. "now we swim over ourselves. can we start, hazel?"
     during the last few minutes hazel had been as near to losing his head as he
was ever to come. he had been at his wits' end, with no reply to bigwig's scornful
impatience except his readiness to risk his own life in company with fiver and
pipkin. he still could not understand what had happened, but at least he realized
that blackberry wanted him to show authority. his head cleared.
     "swim," he said. "everybody swim."
     he watched them as they went in. dandelion swam as well as he ran, swiftly
and easily. silver, too, was strong. the others paddled and scrambled over

somehow, and as they began to reach the other side, hazel plunged.

 the cold
water penetrated his fur almost at once. his breath came short and as his head
went under he could hear a faint grating of gravel along the bottom. he paddled
across awkwardly, his head tilted high out of the water, and made for the figwort.
as he pulled himself out, he looked round among the sopping rabbits in the
alders.
     "where's bigwig?" he asked.
     "behind you," answered blackberry, his teeth chattering.
     bigwig was still in the water, on the other side of the pool. he had swum to the
raft, put his head against it and was pushing it forward with heavy thrusts of his
back legs. "keep still," hazel heard him say in a quick, gulping voice. then he
sank. but a moment later he was up again and had thrust his head over the back
of the board. as he kicked and struggled, it tilted and then, while the rabbits
watched from the bank, moved slowly across the pool and grounded on the
opposite side. fiver pushed pip

kin onto the stones and bigwig waded out beside
them, shivering and breathless.
     "i got the idea once blackberry had shown us," he said. "but it's hard to push it
when you're in the water. i hope it's not long to sunrise. i'm cold. let's get on."
     there was no sign of the dog as they made haste through the alders and up the
field to the first hedgerow. most of them had not understood blackberry's
discovery of the raft and at once forgot it. fiver, however, came over to where
blackberry was lying against the stem of a

was healthy enough. there was no harm in it. but what was it and why was it so
strong? how could it exclude every other smell, in open country on a south wind?
the source must be close by. hazel wondered whether to send one of the rabbits
to find out. dandelion would be over the top and back almost as fast as a hare.
then his sense of adventure and mischief prompted him. he would go himself
and bring back some news before they even knew that he had gone. that would
give bigwig something to bite on.
     he ran easily up the meadow toward the cows. as he came they raised their
heads and gazed at him, all together, for a moment, before returning to their
feeding. a great black bird was flapping and hopping a little way behind the herd.
it looked rather like a large rook, but, unlike a rook, it was alone. he watched its
greenish, powerful beak stabbing the ground, but could not make out what it was
doing. it so happened that hazel had never seen a crow. it did not occur

, and once he had been in a field of
turnips. but this was entirely different from any of those and seemed, somehow,
attractive, wholesome, propitious. true, rabbits could not eat these plants: he
could smell that. but they could lie safely among them for as long as they liked,
and they could move through them easily and unseen. hazel determined then and
there to bring the rabbits up to the beanfield to shelter and rest until the evening.
he ran back and found the others where he had left them. bigwig and silver were
awake, but all the rest were still napping uneasily.
     "not asleep, silver?" he said.
     "it's too dangerous, hazel," replied silver. "i'd like to sleep as much as anyone,
but if we all sleep and something comes, who's going to spot it?"
     "i know. i've found a place where we can sleep safely for as long as we like."
     "a burrow?"
     "no, not a burrow. a great field of scented plants that will cover us, sight and
smell, until we're rested. come out here and smell it

, if you like."
     both rabbits did so. "you say you've seen these plants?" said bigwig, turning
his ears to catch the distant rustling of the beans."

     "yes, they're only just over the top. come on, let's get the others moving before
a man comes with a hrududu* or they'll scatter all over the place."
     silver roused the others and began to coax them into the field. they stumbled
out drowsily, responding with reluctance to his repeated assurance that it was
"only a little way."
     they became widely separated as they straggled up the slope. silver and bigwig
led the way,

 two rabbits with
terrible darts of its head. crows aim at the eyes and pipkin, sensing this, had
buried his head in a clump of rank grass and was trying to burrow further in. it
was he who was screaming.
     hazel covered the distance down the slope in a few seconds. he had no idea
what he was going to do, and if the crow had ignored him he would probably have
been at a loss. but by dashing up he distracted its attention and it turned on him.
he swerved past it, stopped and, looking back, saw bigwig come racing in from
the opposite side. the crow turned again, struck at bigwig and missed. hazel
heard its beak hit a pebble in the grass with a sound like a snail shell when a
thrush beats it on a stone. as silver followed bigwig, it recovered itself and faced
him squarely. silver stopped short in fear and the crow seemed to dance before
him, its great black wings flapping in a horrible commotion. it was just about to
stab when bigwig ran straight into it from behind and knocked it sideways, s

that it staggered across the turf with a harsh, raucous cawing of rage.
     "keep at it!" cried bigwig. "come in behind it! they're cowards! they only
attack helpless rabbits."
     but already the crow was making off, flying low with slow, heavy wing beats.
they watched it clear the further hedge and disappear into the wood beyond the
river. in the silence there was a gentle, tearing sound as a grazing cow moved
nearer.
     bigwig strolled over to pipkin, muttering a ribald owsla lampoon.

     "hoi, hoi u embleer hrair,
     m'saion ulé hraka vair."*

     "come on, hlao-roo," he said. "you can get your head out now. having quite a
day, aren't we?"
     he turned away and pipkin tried to follow him. hazel remembered that fiver
had said he thought he was injured. now, as he watched him limping and
staggering up the slope, it occurred to him that he might actually be wounded in
some way. he kept trying to put his near-si

rom the edge of the
primrose wood at home. it passed in a flash of man-made, unnatural color,
glittering here and there and brighter than a winter holly tree. a few moments
later came the smells of petrol and exhaust. hazel stared, twitching his nose. he
could not understand how the hrududu could move so quickly and smoothly
through the fields. would it return? would it come through the fields faster than
they could run, and hunt them down?
     as he paused, wondering what was best to be done, bigwig came up.
     "there's a road there, then," he said. "that'll give some of them a surprise,
won't it?"
     "a road?" said hazel, thinking of the lane by the notice board. "how do you
know?"
     "well, how do you suppose a hrududu can go that fast? besides, can't you smell
it?"
     the smell of warm tar was now plain on the evening air.
     "i've never smelled that in my life," said hazel with a touch of irritation.
     "ah," said bigwig, "but then you were never sent out stealing lettuces 
 
 ___________________________
 
up with you and we'll let
the others follow."
     they ran on and crept through the hedge. hazel looked down at the road in
astonishment. for a moment he thought that he was looking at another river --
black, smooth and straight between its banks. then he saw the gravel embedded
in the tar and watched a spider running over the surface.
     "but that's not natural," he said, sniffing the strange, strong smells of tar and

oil. "what is it? how did it come there?"
     "it's a man thing," said bigwig. "they put that stuff there and then the hrududil
run on it -- faster than we can; and what else can run faster than we?"
     "it's dangerous, then? they can catch us?"
     "no, that's what's so odd. they don't take any notice of us at all. i'll show you,
if you like."
     the other rabbits were beginning to reach the hedge as bigwig hopped down
the bank and crouched on the verge of the road. from beyond the bend came the
sound of another approaching car. hazel and silver watched tensely. th

appeared, flashing green and white, and raced down toward bigwig. for an
instant it filled the whole world with noise and fear. then it was gone and
bigwig's fur was blowing in the whack of wind that followed it down the hedges.
he jumped back up the bank among the staring rabbits.
     "see? they don't hurt you," said bigwig. "as a matter of fact, i don't think
they're alive at all. but i must admit i can't altogether make it out."
     as on the riverbank, blackberry had moved away and was already down on the
road on his own account, sniffing out toward the middle, halfway between hazel
and the bend. they saw him start and jump back to the shelter of the bank.
     "what is it?" said hazel.
     blackberry did not answer, and hazel and bigwig hopped toward him along
the verge. he was opening and shutting his mouth

 and licking his lips, much as a
cat does when something disgusts it.
     "you say they're not dangerous, bigwig," he said quietly. "but i think they must
be, for all that."
     in the middle of the road was a flattened, bloody mass of brown prickles and
white fur, with small black feet and snout crushed round the edges. the flies
crawled upon it, and here and there the sharp points of gravel pressed up through
the flesh.
     "a yona," said blackberry. "what harm does a yona do to anything but slugs
and beetles? and what can eat a yona?"
     "it must have come at night," said bigwig.
     "yes, of cour

trees, herbage, even the soil -- all were unfamiliar. they hesitated among the
thick heather, unable to see more than a few feet ahead. their fur became soaked

with the dew. the ground was broken by rifts and pits of naked black peat, where
water lay and sharp white stones, some as big as a pigeon's, some as a rabbit's
skull, glimmered in the moonlight. whenever they reached one of these rifts the
rabbits huddled together, waiting for hazel or bigwig to climb the further side
and find a way forward. everywhere they came upon beetles, spiders and small
lizards which scurried away as they pushed through the fibrous, resistant heather.
once buckthorn disturbed a snake, and leaped into the air as it whipped between
his paws to vanish down a hole at the foot of a birch.
     the very plants were unknown to them -- pink lousewort with its sprays of
hooked flowers, bog asphodel and the thin-stemmed blooms of the sundews,

     "we want to go back," said acorn. "we think fiver was wrong."
     "how can you go back through all we've come through?" replied hazel. "and
probably get killed for wounding an owsla officer, if you ever do get back? talk
sense, for frith's sake."
     "it wasn't we who wounded holly," said speedwell.
     "you were there and blackberry brought you there. do you think they won't

remember that? besides--"
     hazel stopped as fiver approached, followed by bigwig.
     "hazel," said fiver, "could you come up on the bank with me for a few
moments? it's important."
     "and while you're there," said bigwig, scowling round at the others from under
the great sheaf of fur on his head, "i'll just have a few words with these three.
why don't you get washed, hawkbit? you look like the end of a rat's tail left in a
trap. and as for you, speedwell--"
     hazel did not wait to hear what speedwell looked like. following fiver, he
scrambled up the lumps and shelve

 at before
hawkbit spoke to him. it stood a few feet above the nodding, windy heather and
was open and grassy at the top. they climbed it and squatted down. to their right
the moon, smoky and yellow in thin night cloud, stood over a clump of distant
pine trees. they looked southward across the dismal waste. hazel waited for fiver
to speak, but he remained silent.
     "what was it you wanted to say to me?" asked hazel at last.
     fiver made no reply and hazel paused in perplexity. from below, bigwig was
just audible.
     "and you, acorn, you dog-eared, dung-faced disgrace to a gamekeeper's gibbet,
if i only had time to tell you--"
     the moon sailed free of the cloud and lit the heather more brightly, but neither
hazel nor fiver moved from the top of the bank. fiver was looking far out beyond
the edge of the common. four miles away, along the southern skyline, rose the
seven-hundred-and-fifty-foot ridge of the downs. on the highest point, the beech
trees of cottington's clump were movin

 was no mist around them. the may night was clear and fresh. hazel
waited in silence and after a time fiver said, slowly and expressionlessly, "but we
must go on, until we reach the hills." his voice sank and became that of a sleep-
talker. "until we reach the hills. the rabbit that goes back through the gap will
run his head into trouble. that running -- not wise. that running -- not safe.
running -- not--" he trembled violently, kicked once or twice and became quiet.
     in the hollow below, bigwig seemed to be drawing to a close. "and now, you
bunch of mole-snouted, muck-raking, hutch-hearted sheep ticks, get out of my
sight sharp. otherwise i'll--" he became inaudible again.
     hazel looked once more at the faint line of the hills. then, as fiver stirred and
muttered beside him, he pushed him gently with one forepaw and nuzzled his
shoulder.
     fiver started. "what was i saying, hazel?" he asked. "i'm afraid i can't
remember. i meant to tell you--"
     "never mind," answered hazel.

          malory, le morte d'arthur

     when hazel and fiver reached the floor of the hollow they found blackberry
wailing for them, crouching on the peat and nibbling at a few brown stalks of
sedge grass.
     "hello," said hazel. "what's happened? where are the others?"
     "over there," answered blackberry. "there's been a fearful row. bigwig told
hawkbit and speedwell that he'd scratch them to pieces if they didn't obey him.
and when hawkbit said he wanted to know who was chief rabbit, bigwig bit
him. it seems a nasty business. who is chief rabbit, anyway -- you or bigwig?"
     "i don't know," answered hazel, "but bigwig's certainly the strongest. there
was no need to go biting hawkbit: he couldn't have gone back if he'd tried. he
and his friends would have seen that if they'd been allowed to talk for a bit. now

there are too few of us for giving orders and biting people. frith in a fog! isn't
there enough trouble and danger already?"
     they went over to the far end of the pit. bigwig and silver were talking with
buckthorn under an overhanging broom. nearby, pipkin and dandelion were
pretending to feed on a patch of scrub. some way away, acorn was making a great

business of licking hawkbit's throat, while speedwell watched.
     "keep still if you can, poor old chap," said acorn, who obviously wanted to be
overheard. "just let me clean the blood out. steady, now!" hawkbit winced in an
exaggerated manner and backed away. as hazel came up, all the rabbits turned

ce dandelion struck the smell of a stoat and they all
joined him, whispering and sniffing over the ground. but the scent was old and
after a time they went on again. in this low undergrowth their disorganized
progress and uneven, differing rhythms of movement delayed them still more
than in the wood. there were continual stampings of alarm, pausing, freezing to
the spot at the sound of movement real or imagined. it was so dark that hazel
seldom knew for certain whether he was leading or whether bigwig or silver
might not be ahead. once, hearing an unaccountable noise in front of him, which
ceased on the instant, he kept still for a long time; and when at last he moved
cautiously forward, found silver crouching behind a tussock of cocksfoot for fear
of the sound of his own approach. all was confusion, ignorance, clambering and
exhaustion. throughout the bad dream of the night's journey, pipkin seemed to
be always close beside him. though each of the others vanished and reappeared

 thought you were making it up. i should have known better.
frithrah, you're what i call a chief rabbit!"
     "well done, hazel!" said buckthorn. "well done!"
     hazel did not know what to reply. he looked at them in silence and it was
acorn who spoke next.
     "come on!" he said. "who's going to be first into that field? i can still run." he
was off, slowly enough, down the slope, but when hazel stamped for him to stop
he did so at once.
     "where are the others?" said hazel. "dandelion? bigwig?"
     at that moment dandelion appeared out of the heather and sat on the path,
looking at the field. he was followed first by hawkbit and then by fiver. hazel
was watching fiver as he took in the sight of the field, when buckthorn drew his
attention back to the foot of the slope.
     "look, hazel," he said, "silver and bigwig are down there. they're waiting for
us."
     silver's light-gray fur showed up plainly against a low spray of gorse, but hazel
could not see bigwig until he sat up and

e earth is scented; and the hares bound and skip in the
warm wind. hopelessness and reluctance are blown away like a fog and the dumb
solitude where they crept, a place desolate as a crack in the ground, opens like a
rose and stretches to the hills and the sky.
     the tired rabbits fed and basked in the sunny meadow as though they had
come no further than from the bank at the edge of the nearby copse. the heather
and the stumbling darkness were forgotten as though the sunrise had melted
them. bigwig and hawkbit chased each other through the long grass. speedwell
jumped over the little brook that ran down the middle of the field and when
acorn tried to follow him and fell short, silver joked with him as he scrambled
out and rolled him in a patch of dead oak leaves until he was dry. as the sun rose
higher, shortening the shadows and drawing the dew from the grass, most of the
rabbits came wandering back to the sun-flecked shade among the cow parsley
along the edge of the ditch. here, hazel a

much longer."
     fiver looked as though he were about to speak, but then shook his ears and
turned to nibbling at a dandelion.
     "that looks a good bank, along the edge of the trees up there," answered hazel.
"what do you say, fiver? shall we go up there now or shall we wait a bit longer?"
     fiver hesitated and then replied, "just as you think, hazel."
     "well, there's no need to do any serious digging, is there?" said bigwig. "that
sort of thing's all right for does, but not for us."
     "still, we'd better make one or two scrapes, don't you think?" said hazel.
"something to give us shelter at a pinch. let's go up to the copse and look round.
we might as well take our time and make quite sure where we'd like to have
them. we don't want to have to do the work twice."

     "yes, that's the style," said bigwig. "and while you're doing that, i'll take silver
and buckthorn here and have a run down the fields beyond,

ng to me. let's go back a little way, between the
woods, and have a scratch near that oak tree there -- just by that white patch of
stitchwort. i know the farm's a long way off, but there's no point in being nearer
to it than we need. and if we're fairly close to the wood opposite, the trees will
help to break the wind a bit in winter."
     "splendid," said blackberry. "it's going to cloud over, do you see? rain before
sunset and we'll be in shelter. well, let's make a start. oh, look! there's bigwig
coming back along the bottom, and the other two with him."
     the three rabbits were returning down the bank of the stream and had not yet
seen hazel and the others. they passed below them, into the narrower part of the
field between the two copses, and it was not until acorn had been sent halfway
down the slope to attract their attention that they turned and came up to the
ditch.
     "i don't think there's going to be much to trouble us here, hazel," said bigwig.
"the farm's a good way away

sticks that they burn in their mouths. but that's all for the best, i reckon. we keep
away from the men and the men frighten the elil away."
     "why do the men come, do you suppose?" asked fiver.
     "who knows why men do anything? they may drive cows or sheep in the
fields, or cut wood in the copses. what does it matter? i'd rather dodge a man
than a stoat or a fox."
     "well, that's fine," said hazel. "you've found out a lot, bigwig, and all to the
good. we were just going to make some scrapes along the bank there. we'd better
start. the rain won't be long now, if i know anything about it."
     buck rabbits on their own seldom or never go in for serious digging. this is the
natural job of a doe making a home for her litter before they are born, and then
her buck helps her. all the same, solitary bucks -- if they can find no existing
holes to make use of -- will sometimes scratch out short tunnels for shelter,

xt time he left the digging he kept away from fiver and sat
looking at the bank, as though entirely concerned with the work.
     a little while after ni-frith the sky clouded over thickly. the light grew dull and
they could smell rain approaching from the west. the blue tit that had been
swinging on a bramble, singing "heigh ho, go-and-get-another-bit-of-moss,"
stopped his acrobatics and flew into the wood. hazel was just wondering whether
it would be worthwhile starting a side passage to link bigwig's hole to
dandelion's, when he felt a stamp of warning from somewhere close by. he
turned quickly. it was fiver who had stamped and he was now staring intently
across the field.
     beside a tussock of grass a little way outside the opposite copse, a rabbit was
sitting and gazing at them. its ears were erect and it was evidently giving them the
full attention of sight, smell and hearing. hazel rose on his hind legs, paused, and
then sat back on his haunches, in full view. the other rabbit rema

perhaps, thought hazel wryly, teeth and claws would make no impression on that
great, firm body and shining pelt.
     when they reached the ditch, all the other rabbits were squatting together,
watching their approach. hazel stopped in front of them but did not know what
to say. if the stranger had not been there, he would have given them an account of

what had happened. if blackberry and he had driven the stranger across the field
by force, he could have handed him over for safekeeping to bigwig or silver. but
to have him sitting beside him, looking his followers over in silence and
courteously waiting for someone else to speak first -- this was a situation beyond
hazel's experience. it was bigwig, straightforward and blunt as always, who broke
the tension.
     "who is this, hazel?" he said. "why has he come back with you?"
     "i don't know," answered hazel, trying to look frank and feeling foolish. "he
came of his own accord."
     "well, we'd better ask him, then," said bigwig, wi

th something like a sneer. he
came close to the stranger and sniffed, as hazel had done. he, too, was evidently
affected by the peculiar smell of prosperity, for he paused as though in
uncertainty. then, with a rough, abrupt air, he said, "who are you and what do
you want?"
     "my name is cowslip," said the other. "i don't want anything. i hear you've
come a long way."
     "perhaps we have," said bigwig. "we know how to defend ourselves, too."
     "i'm sure you do," said cowslip, looking round at the mud-stained, bedraggled
rabbits with an air of being too polite to comment. "but it can be hard to defend
oneself against the weather. there's going to be rain and i don't think your
scrapes are finished." he looked at bigwig, as though waiting for him to ask
another question. bigwig seemed confused. clearly, he could make no more of the
situation than hazel. there was silence except for the soun

ide their ears.
     "fine, big fellow, isn't he?" said buckthorn. "he doesn't look as though he had
much to bother about, living here."
     "what should we do, hazel, do you think?" asked silver. "it's true what he said,
isn't it? these scrapes -- well, we can crouch in them out of the weather, but no
more than that. and as we can't all get into one, we shall have to split up."
     "we'll join them together," said hazel, "and while we're doing that i'd like to
talk about what he said. fiver, bigwig and blackberry, can you come with me?
the rest of you split how you like."
     the new hole was short, narrow and rough. there was no room for two rabbits
to pass. four were like beans in a pod. for the first time, hazel began to realize

corners. every length smells of rabbit -- of that great, indestructible flood of

one of hazel's rabbits had ever played any part in real digging. the work they had
done that morning was trifling and all they had to show for it was rough shelter
and little comfort.
     there is nothing like bad weather to reveal the shortcomings of a dwelling,
particularly if it is too small. you are, as they say, stuck with it and have leisure to
feel all its peculiar irritations and discomforts. bigwig, with his usual brisk
energy, set to work. hazel, however, returned and sat pensive at the lip of the
hole, looking out at the silent, rippling veils of rain that drifted across and across
the little valley between the two copses. closer, before his nose, every blade of
grass, every bracken frond was bent, dripping and glistening. the smell of last
year's oak leaves filled the air. it had turned chilly. across the field the bloom of
the cherry tree under which they had sat that morning hung sod

they must have seen us come. we were tired. surely that was the time to attack
us? or while we were separated, before we began digging? but they didn't. i
reckon they're more likely to be friendly than otherwise. there's only one thing
beats me. what do they stand to get from asking us to join their warren?"
     "fools attract elil by being easy prey," said bigwig, cleaning the mud out of his
whiskers and blowing through his long front teeth. "and we're fools until we've
learned to live here. safer to teach us, perhaps. i don't know -- give it up. but i'm
not afraid to go and find out. if they do try any tricks, they'll find i know a few as
well. i wouldn't mind taking a chance, to sleep somewhere more comfortable than
this. we haven't slept since yesterday afternoon."

     cold and damp, hazel felt impatient. he had always been accustomed to rely
on fiver and now, when he really needed him, he was letting them down.
blackberry's reasoning had been first-rate and bigwig had at least shown which
way any sound-hearted rabbit would be likely to lean. apparently the only
contribution fiver could make was this beetle-spirited vaporing. he tried to
remember that fiver was undersized and that they had had an anxious time and
were all weary. at this moment the soil at the far end of the burrow began to
crumble inward, then it fell away and silver's head and front paws appeared.
     "here we are," said silver cheerfully. "we've done what you wanted, hazel, and

     "i don't know how many of them there are," said silver, "but we're quite a
crowd. anyhow, i hate the idea of just keeping away. how long have rabbits been

     "very well," said hazel. "that's how i feel myself. i just wanted to know
whether you did. would you like bigwig and me to go over there first, by
ourselves, and report back?"
     "no," said silver. "let's all go. if we're going at all, for frith's sake let's do it as
though we weren't afraid. what do you say, dandelion?"
     "i think you're right."
     "then we'll go now," said hazel. "get the others and follow me."

les to his own, passing on his way through the narrow strip of woodland that
lay between. indeed, as hazel turned the point and stopped to look about him, he
could see the place where cowslip must have come out. a clear rabbit track led
from the bracken, under the fence and into the field. in the bank on the further
side of the bay the rabbit holes were plain to see, showing dark and distinct in the
bare ground. it was as conspicuous a warren as could well be imagined.
     "sky above us!" said bigwig. "every living creature for miles must know that's
there! look at all the tracks in the grass, too! do you think they sing in the
morning, like the thrushes?"
     "perhaps they're too secure to bother about concealing themselves," said
blackberry. "after all, the home warren was fairly plain to be seen."
     "yes, but not like that! a couple of hrududil could go down some of those
holes."
     "so could i," said dandelion. "i'm getting dreadfully wet."

s separation of which he had been afraid. he
now realized with astonishment that there was apparently a part of the warren
underground which was big enough to contain them all together. he felt so
curious to visit it that he did not stop to make any detailed arrangements about
the order in which they should go down. however, he put pipkin immediately
behind him. "it'll warm his little heart for once," he thought, "and if the leaders
do get attacked, i suppose we can spare him easier than some." bigwig he asked
to bring up the rear. "if there's any trouble, get out of it," he said, "and take as
many as you can with you." then he followed their guides into one of the holes in
the bank.
     the run was broad, smooth and dry. it was obviously a highway, for other runs
branched off it in all directions. the rabbits in front went fast and hazel had little
time to sniff about as he followed. suddenly he checked. he had come into an
open place. his whiskers could feel no earth in front and none was

ould be plenty of time, as they settled
down in the warren, to show these strangers that they were as good as
themselves, without risking trouble by putting on airs at the start.
     "we're glad to be out of the bad weather," he said. "we're like all rabbits --
happiest in a crowd. when you came over to see us in the field, cowslip, you said
your warren wasn't large, but judging by the holes we saw along the bank, it must
be what we'd reckon a fine, big one."
     as he finished he sensed that bigwig had just entered the hall, and knew that
they were all together again. the stranger rabbits seemed slightly disconcerted by
his little speech and he felt that for some reason or other he had not struck the
right note in complimenting them on their numbers. perhaps there were not very
many of them after all? had there been disease? there was no smell or sign of it.
these were the biggest and healthiest rabbits he had ever met. perhaps their
fidgeting and silence had nothing to do with what he ha

vidently this
belonged to the couple, for they settled down as though at home and made no
objection when hazel did the same. here, while the mood of the great hall slowly
passed from them, all three were silent for a time.
     "is cowslip the chief rabbit?" asked hazel at length.
     the other replied with a question. "are you called chief rabbit?"
     hazel found this awkward to answer. if he replied that he was, his new friends
might address him so for the future, and he could imagine what bigwig and silver
would have to say about that. as usual, he fell back on plain honesty.
     "we're only a few," he said. "we left our warren in a hurry to escape from bad
things. most stayed behind and the chief rabbit was one of them. i've been trying
to lead my friends, but i don't know whether they'd care to hear me called chief
rabbit."
     "that'll make him ask a few questions," he thought. "'why did you leave? why
didn't the rest come? what were you afraid of?' and whatever am i going to say?

what's the idea?"
     "i don't know," replied hazel. "i suddenly felt i had to get out and i wanted
your company. i can see what's troubling fiver; though he'll get over it, i dare say.
there is something strange about these rabbits. do you know they push stones
into the wall?"
     "they do what?"
     hazel explained. blackberry was as much at a loss as he had been himself. "but
i'll tell you another thing," he said. "bigwig wasn't so far wrong. they do sing like
the birds. i was in a burrow belonging to a rabbit called betony. his doe has a
litter and she was making a noise over them rather like a robin in autumn. to
send them to sleep, she said. it made me feel queer, i can tell you."
     "and what do you think of them, hlao-roo?" asked hazel.
     "they're very nice and kind," answered pipkin, "but i'll tell you how they strike
me. they all seem terribly sad. i can't think why, when they're so big and strong

fill the warren, anything like. perhaps they've had some sort of trouble that's left

     "we don't know because they don't tell us. but if we're going to stay here we've
got to learn to get on with them. we can't fight them: they're too big. and we
don't want them fighting us."
     "i don't believe they can fight, hazel," said pipkin. "although they're so big,
they don't seem like fighters to me. not like bigwig and silver."
     "you notice a lot, don't you, hlao-roo?" said hazel. "do you notice it's raining
harder than ever? i've got enough grass in my stomach for a bit. we'll go down
again now, but let's keep to ourselves for a while."
     "why not sleep?" said blackberry. "it's over a night and a day now and i'm
dropping."
     they returned down a different hole and soon found a dry, empty burrow,
where they curled up together and slept in the warmth of their own tired bodies.

e he perceived at once that it was morning -- some time after
sunrise, by the smell of it. the scent of apple blossom was plain enough. then he
picked up the fainter smells of buttercups and horses. mingled with these came
another. although it made him uneasy, he could not tell for some moments what
it was. a dangerous smell, an unpleasant smell, a totally unnatural smell -- quite
close outside: a smoke smell -- something was burning. then he remembered
how bigwig, after his reconnaissance on the previous day, had spoken of the little
white sticks in the grass. that was it. a man had been walking over the ground
outside. that must have been what had awakened him.
     hazel lay in the warm, dark burrow with a delightful sense of security. he
could smell the man. the man could not smell him. all the man could smell was
the nasty smoke he was making. he fell to thinking of the shape in the well pit,
and then dropped into a drowsy half-dream, in which el-ah

used to taking a good look round when you silflay, but here we generally go
straight out."
     hazel did not mean to alter his ways or take instructions from cowslip.
however, no one had pushed him and there was no point in bickering over trifles.
he hopped across the ditch to the further bank and looked round him again.
several rabbits were already running down the field toward a distant hedge
dappled white with great patches of maybloom. he saw bigwig and silver and
went to join them, flicking the wet off his front paws step by step, like a cat.
     "i hope your friends have been looking after you as well as these fellows have
looked after us, hazel," said bigwig. "silver and i really feel at home again. if you
ask me, i reckon we've all made a big change for the better. even if fiver's wrong

was busy all morning, high in a
silver birch near the abandoned holes across the dip; and from deep in the copse,
somewhere by the disused well, came the beautiful song of the blackcap. by early
afternoon there was a stillness of heat, and a herd of cows from the higher fields
slowly grazed their way down into the shade. only a few of the rabbits remained
above ground. almost all were asleep in the burrows. but still fiver sat alone
under the yew tree.
     in the early evening hazel sought out bigwig and together they ventured into
the copse behind the warren. at first they moved cautiously, but before long they
grew confident at finding no trace of any creature larger than a mouse.
     "there's nothing to smell," said bigwig, "and no tracks. i think cowslip's told
us no more than the truth. there really aren't any elil here. different from that
wood where we crossed the river. i don't mind telling you, hazel, i was scared
stiff that night, but i wasn't going to show it."
     "so was i,"

answered hazel. "but i agree with you about this place. it seems
completely clear. if we--"
     "this is odd, though," interrupted bigwig. he was in a clump of brambles, in
the middle of which was a rabbit hole that led up from one of the warren passages
below. the ground was soft and damp, with old leaves thick in the mold. where
bigwig had stopped there were signs of commotion. the rotten leaves had been
thrown up in showers. some were hanging on the brambles and a few flat, wet
clots were lying well out in open ground beyond the clump. in the center the
earth had been laid bare and was scored with long scratches and furrows, and
there was a narrow, regular hole, about the same size as one of the carrots they
had carried that morning. the two rabbits sniffed and stared, but could make
nothing of it.
     "the funny thing is t

here's no smell," said bigwig.
     "no -- only rabbit, and that's everywhere, of course. and man -- that's
everywhere, too. but that smell might very well have nothing to do with it. all it
tells us is that a man walked through the wood and threw a white stick down. it
wasn't a man that tore up this ground."
     "well, these mad rabbits probably dance in the moonlight or something."
     "i wouldn't be surprised," said hazel. "it would be just like them. let's ask
cowslip."
     "that's the only silly thing you've said so

 no -- not many."
     "try asking him where he dances in the moonlight. say 'cowslip, where--'"
     "oh, you've noticed that, too, have you? he won't answer 'where' anything.
neither will strawberry. i think they may be nervous of us. pipkin was right when

he said they weren't fighters. so they're keeping up a mystery to stay even with us.
it's best just to put up with it. we don't want to upset them and it's bound to
smooth itself out in time."
     "there's more rain coming tonight," said bigwig. "soon, too, i think. let's go
underground and see if we can get them to talk a bit more freely."
     "i think that's something we can only wait for. but i agree about going
underground now. and for goodness' sake let's get fiver to come with us. he
troubles me. do you know he was out all night in the rain?"
     as they went back through the copse hazel recounted his talk with fiver that
morning. they found him under the yew tree and after a rather stormy scene,

hazel and his friends conferred. after a short time blackberry announced, "we've
asked hazel to tell you about our adventures: how we made our journey here and
had the good luck to join you."
     there was an uncomfortable silence, broken only by shuffling and whispering.
blackberry, dismayed, turned back to hazel and bigwig.
     "what's the matter?" he asked in a low voice. "surely there's no harm in that?"
     "wait," replied hazel quietly. "let them tell us if they don't like it. they have
their own ways here."
     however, the silence continued for some time, as though the other rabbits did
not care to mention what they thought was wrong.
     "it's no good," said blackberry at last. "you'll have to say something yourself,
hazel. no, why should you? i'll do it." he spoke up again. "on second thoughts,

     "which one, though?" said dandelion.
     hazel remembered the stones by the well pit. "the king's lettuce," he
answered. "they think a lot of that, i believe."
     dandelion took up his cue with the same plucky readiness that he had shown

in the wood. "i'll tell the story of the king's lettuce," he said aloud.
     "we shall enjoy that," replied cowslip immediately.
     "he'd better," muttered bigwig.

     "that's put their ears flat for them," whispered bigwig. "let's just see them find
a storyteller to beat him."
     they were all in no doubt that dandelion had done them credit. ever since
their arrival most of them had felt out of their depth among these magnificent,
well-fed strangers, with their detached manners, their shapes on the wall, their
elegance, their adroit evasion of almost all questions -- above all, their fits of un-
rabbitlike melancholy. now, their own storyteller had shown that they were no

     "but he must know it, surely?" muttered blackberry to hazel.
     "i always think these traditional stories retain a lot of charm," said another of
the rabbits, "especially when they're told in the real, old-fashioned spirit."

     "yes," said strawberry. "conviction, that's what it needs. you really have to
believe in el-ahrairah and prince rainbow, don't you? then all the rest follows."
     "don't say anything, bigwig," whispered hazel: for bigwig was scuffling his
paws indignantly. "you can't force them to like it if they don't. let's wait and see
what they can do themselves." aloud, he said, "our stories haven't changed in
generations, you know. after all, we haven't changed ourselves. our lives have
been the same as our fathers' and their fathers' before them. things are different
here. we realize that, and we think your new ideas and ways are very exciting.

    one of the rabbits seemed to accept what hazel had said, but the other replied,
"oh, another poet? let's hear him, then. that'll be some return for my shoulder,
anyway. he's scratched a great tuft of fur out."
     fiver was already beyond them and thrusting toward the further entrance

himself had taken to be friendly, he felt so cross at the way in which fiver had
antagonized their new friends that as he passed bigwig, he said, "come and help
me to get some sense into him. the last thing we want is a fight now." he felt that
fiver really deserved a short touch of bigwig.
     they followed fiver up the run and overtook him at the entrance. before either
of them could say a word, he turned and began to speak as though they had asked
him a question.
     "you felt it, then? and you want to know whether i did? of course i did. that's
the worst part of it. there isn't any trick. he speaks the truth. so as long a

great mist of folly that covers the whole sky: and we shall never see to go by
frith's light any more. oh, what will become of us? a thing can be true and still be
desperate folly, hazel."
     "what on earth's all this?" said hazel to bigwig in perplexity.
     "he's talking about that lop-eared nitwit of a poet down there," answered
bigwig. "i know that much. but why he seems to think we should want to have
anything to do with him and his fancy talk -- that's more than i can imagine. you
can save your breath, fiver. the only thing that's bothering us is the row you've
started. as for silverweed, all i can say is, i'll keep silver and he can be just plain

would be pointless. but what you are going to do now is to come underground
with the two of us and sleep. come on! and don't say any more for the moment."
     one respect in which rabbits' lives are less complicated than those of humans
is that they are not ashamed to use force. having no alternative, fiver
accompanied hazel and bigwig to the burrow where hazel had spent the previous
night. there was no one there and they lay down and slept.

     it was cold, it was cold and the roof was made of bones. the roof was made of
the interlaced sprays of the yew tree, stiff twigs twisted in and out, over and
under, hard as ice and set with dull red berries. "come on, hazel," said cowslip.
"we're going to carry the yew berries home in our mouths and eat them in the
great burrow. your friends must learn to do that if they want to go our way." "no!
no!" cried fiver. "hazel, no!" but then came bigwig, twisting in and out of the
branches, his mouth full of berries. "look," said bigwig, "i can do it. i'm running
another way. ask me where, hazel! ask me where! ask me where!" then they
were running another way, running, not to the warren but over the fields in the
cold, and bigwig dropped the berries -- blood-red drops, red droppings hard as
wire. "it's no good," he said. "no good biting them. they're cold."

was stirring and twitching in his sleep, searching for warmth, trying to press
against another rabbit's body no longer there. the shallow hollow in the sandy
floor where fiver had lain was not quite cold: but fiver was gone.
     "fiver!" said hazel in the dark.
     as soon as he had spoken he knew there would be no reply. he pushed bigwig
with his nose, butting urgently. "bigwig! fiver's gone! bigwig!"
     bigwig was wide awake on the instant and hazel had never felt so glad of his
sturdy readiness.
     "what did you say? what's wrong?"
     "fiver's gone."
     "where's he gone?"
     "silf -- outside. it can only be silf. you know he wouldn't go wandering about in

     bigwig listened and sniffed for a few moments.
     "it's very nearly light," he said. "there'll be light enough to find him by. well,
i'd better come with you, i suppose. don't worry -- he can't have gone far. but by
the king's lettuce! i won't half give him a piece of my mind when we catch him."
     "i'll hold him down while you kick him, if only we can find him. come on!"
     they went up the run to the mouth of the hole and paused together. "since our
friends aren't here to push us," said bigwig

    "it's moving away," said hazel.
     "how many field mice say that every night, i wonder? you know the call's
deceptive. it's meant to be."
     "well, i can't help it," said hazel. "fiver's somewhere out there and i'm going
after him. you were right, anyway. it is light -- just."
     "shall we look under the yew tree first?"
     but fiver was not under the yew tree. the light, as it grew, began to show the
upper field, while the distant hedge and brook remained dark, linear shapes
below. bigwig jumped down from the bank into the field and ran in a long curve
across the wet grass. he stopped almost opposite the hole by which they had
come up, and hazel joined him.
     "here's his line, all right," said bigwig. "fresh, too. from the hole straight
down toward the brook. he won't be far away."

crossed. they followed the line down the field and reached the hedge beside the

he was feeding, alone. a few fragments of carrot were still lying about near the
spring, but he had left these untouched and was eating the grass not far from the
gnarled crab-apple tree. they approached and he looked up.
     hazel said nothing and began to feed beside him. he was now regretting that
he had brought bigwig. in the darkness before morning and the first shock of
discovering that fiver was gone, bigwig had been a comfort and a stand-by. but
now, as he saw fiver, small and familiar, incapable of hurting anyone or of
concealing what he felt, trembling in the wet grass, either from fear or from cold,
his anger melted away. he felt only sorry for him and sure that, if they could stay
alone together for a while, fiver would come round to an easier state of mind. but

igwig to be gentle: he could only hope for
the best.
     contrary to his fears, however, bigwig remained as silent as himself. evidently
he had been expecting hazel to speak first and was somewhat at a loss. for some
time all three moved on quietly over the grass, while the shadows grew stronger
and the wood pigeons clattered among the distant trees. hazel was beginning to
feel that all would be well and that bigwig had more sense than he had given him
credit for, when fiver sat up on his hind legs, cleaned his face with his paws and
then, for the first time, looked directly at him.
     "i'm going now," he said. "i feel very sad. i'd like to wish you well, hazel, but
there's no good to wish you in this place. so just goodbye."
     "but where are you going, fiver?"
     "away. to the hills, if i can get there."
     "by yourself, alone? you can't. you'd die."
     "you wouldn't have a hope, old chap," sai

     "no," said fiver very quietly. "you are closer to death than i."
     "are you trying to frighten me, you miserable little lump of chattering

chickweed?" cried bigwig. "i've a good mind--"
     "wait, bigwig," said hazel. "don't speak roughly to him."
     "why, you said yourself--" began bigwig.
     "i know. but i feel differently now. i'm sorry, bigwig. i was going to ask you to
help me to make him come back to the warren. but now -- well, i've always found
that there was something in what fiver had to say. for the last two days i've
refused to listen to him and i still think he's out of his senses. but i haven't the
heart to drive him back to the warren. i really believe that for some reason or
other the place is frightening him out of his wits. i'll go with him a little way and
perhaps we can talk. i can't ask you to risk it, too. anyway, t

     bigwig stared. then he turned furiously on fiver. "you wretched little black
beetle," he said. "you've never learned to obey orders, have you? it's me, me, me
all the time. 'oh, i've got a funny feeling in my toe, so we must all go and stand on
our heads!' and now we've found a fine warren and got into it without even
having to fight, you've got to do your best to upset everyone! and then you risk

ainst the impulse to run. what enemy was at work on the other side of
the hedge? there were no cries -- no spitting of a cat, no squealing of a rabbit --
only the crackling of twigs and the tearing of the grass in violence.
     by an effort of courage against all instinct, hazel forced himself forward into
the gap, with fiver following. a terrible sight lay before them. the rotten leaves
had been thrown up in showers. the earth had been laid bare and was scored
with long scratches and furrows. bigwig was lying on his side, his back legs
kicking and struggling. a length of twisted copper wire, gleaming dully in the first
sunlight, was looped round his neck and ran taut across one forepaw to the head
of a stout peg driven into the ground. the running knot had pulled tight and was
buried in the fur behind his ear. the projecting point of one strand had lacerated
his neck and drops of blood, dark and red as yew berries, welled one by one down
his shoulder. for a few moments he lay panting, his

side heaving in exhaustion.
then again began the struggling and fighting, backward and forward, jerking and
falling, until he choked and lay quiet.
     frenzied with distress, hazel leaped out of the gap and squatted beside him.

fixed snarl. he had bitten his lower lip and from this, too, the blood was running.

     "thlayli!" said hazel, stamping. "thlayli! listen! you're in a snare -- a snare!

what did they say in the owsla? come on -- think. how can we help you?"
     there was a pause. then bigwig's back legs began to kick once more, but
feebly. his ears drooped. his eyes opened unseeing and the whites show
 
 ___________________________
 
  "owsla -- no good -- biting wire. peg -- got to -- dig out."
     a convulsion shook him and he scrabbled at the ground, covering himself in a
mask of wet earth and blood. then he was still again.
     "run, fiver, run to the warren," cried hazel. "get the others -- blackberry,
silver. be quick! he'll die."
     fiver was off up the field like a hare. hazel, left alone, tried to understand what
was needed. what was the peg? how was he to dig it out? he looked down at the
foul mess before him. bigwig was lying across the wire, which came out under his
belly and seemed to disappear into the ground. hazel struggled with his own
incomprehension. bigwig had said, "dig." that at least he understood. he began
to scratch into the soft earth beside the body, until after a time his claws scraped
against something smooth and firm. as he paused, perplexed, he found
blackberry at his shoulder.
     "bigwig just spoke," he said to him, "but i don't think he can now. he said, 'dig
out the peg.' what does

 that mean? what have we got to do?"
     "wait a moment," said blackberry. "let me think, and try not to be impatient."
     hazel turned his head and looked down the course of the brook. far away,
between the two copses, he could see the cherry tree where two days before he
had sat with blackberry and fiver in the sunrise. he remembered how bigwig had
chased hawkbit through the long grass, forgetting the quarrel of the previous
night in the joy of their arrival. he could see hawkbit running toward him now
and two or three of the others -- silver, dandelion and pipkin. dandelion, well in
front, dashed up to the gap and checked, twitching and staring.
     "what is it, hazel? what's happened? fiver said--"
     "bigwig's in a wire. let him alone till blackberry tells us. stop the others
crowding round."
     dandelion turned and raced back

there, look. we've got to dig it out. come on -- dig beside it."
     hazel dug once more, his forepaws throwing up the soft, wet soil and slipping
against the hard sides of the peg. dimly, he was aware of the others waiting
nearby. after a time he was forced to stop, panting. silver took his place, and was
followed by buckthorn. the nasty, smooth, clean, man-smelling peg was laid bare
to the length of a rabbit's ear, but still it did not come loose. bigwig had not
moved. he lay across the wire, torn and bloody, with closed eyes. buckthorn drew
his head and paws out of the hole and rubbed the mud off his face.
     "the peg's narrower down there," he said. "it tapers. i think it could be bitten
through, but i can't get my teeth to it."

     "send pipkin in," said blackberry. "he's smaller."
     pipkin plunged into the hole. they could hear the wood splintering under his
teeth -- a sound like a mouse in a shed wainscot at midnight. he came out w

     "the splinters prick you and it's hard to breathe, but the peg's nearly through."
     "fiver, go in," said hazel.
     fiver was not long in the hole. he, too, came out bleeding.
     "it's broken in two. it's free."
     blackberry pressed his nose against bigwig's head. as he nuzzled him gently
the head rolled sideways and back again.
     "bigwig," said blackberry in his ear, "the peg's out."
     there was no response. bigwig lay still as before. a great fly settled on one of
his ears. blackberry thrust at it angrily and it flew up, buzzing, into the sunshine.
     "i think he's gone," said blackberry. "i can't feel his breathing."
     hazel crouched down by blackberry and laid his nostrils close to bigwig's, but
a light breeze was blowing and he could not tell whether there was breath or not.

point of the sharp wire pierced the windpipe?
     "bigwig," he whispered, "we've got you out. you're free."
     bigwig did not stir. suddenly it came to hazel that if bigwig was dead -- and
what else could hold him silent in the mud? -- then he himself must get the others
away before the dreadful loss could drain their courage and break their spirit -- as
it would if they stayed by the body. besides, the man would come soon. perhaps
he was already coming, with his gun, to take poor bigwig away. they must go;
and he must do his best to see that all of them -- even he himself -- put what had
happened out of mind, forever.

said to blackberry, quoting a rabbit proverb.
     "if only it were not bigwig," said blackberry. "what shall we do without him?"
     "the others are waiting," said hazel. "we have to stay alive. there has to be
something for them to think about. help me, or it will be more than i can do."
     he turned away from the body and looked for fiver among the rabbits behind
him. but fiver was nowhere to be seen and hazel was afraid to ask for him, in
case to do so should seem like weakness and a need for comfort.
     "pipkin," he snapped, "why don't you clean up your face and

the smell of blood attracts elil. you know that, don't you?"
     "yes, hazel. i'm sorry. will bigwig--"
     "and another thing," said hazel desperately. "what was it you were telling me
about cowslip? did you say he told fiver to be quiet?"
     "yes, hazel. fiver came into the warren and told us about the snare, and that
poor bigwig--"
     "yes, all right. and then cowslip--?"
     "cowslip and strawberry and the others pretended not to hear. it was
ridiculous, because fiver was calling out to everybody. and then as we were
running out silver said to cowslip, 'surely you're coming?' and cowslip simply
turned his back. so then fiver went up and spoke to him very quietly, but i heard

     "i'll kill him," gasped a low, choking voice behind them. they all leaped round.
bigwig had raised his head and was supporting himself on his forepaws alone. his
body was twisted and his hind parts and back legs still lay along the ground. his
eyes were open, but his face was such a fearful mask of blood, foam, vomit and
earth that he looked more like some demon creature than a rabbit, the
immediate sight of him, which should have filled them with relief and joy,
brought only terror. they cringed away and none said a word.
     "i'll kill him," repeated bigwig, spluttering through

 his fouled whiskers and
clotted fur. "help me, rot you! can't anyone get this stinking wire off me?" he
struggled, dragging his hind legs. then he fell again and crawled forward, trailing
the wire through the grass with the broken peg snickering behind it.
     "let him alone!" cried hazel, for now they were all pressing forward to help
him. "do you want to kill him? let him rest! let him breathe!"
     "no, not rest," panted bigwig. "i'm all right." as he spoke he fell again and
immediately struggled up on his forepaws as before. "it's my back legs. won't
move. that cowslip! i'll kill him!"
     "why do we let them stay in that warren?" cried silver. "what sort of rabbits
are they? they left bigwig to die. you all heard cowslip in the burrow. they're
cowards. let's drive them out -- kill them! take the warren and live there
ourselves!"
     "yes! yes!" they all answered. "come on! back to the warren! down with

and anything else that could make believe that the rabbit loved the shining wire.
but one strict rule they had; oh yes, the strictest. no one must ever ask where
another rabbit was and anyone who asked 'where?' -- except in a song or a poem
-- must be silenced. to say 'where?' was bad enough, but to speak openly of the
wires -- that was intolerable. for that they would scratch and kill."
     he stopped. no one moved. then, in the silence, bigwig lurched to his feet,
swayed a moment, tottered a few steps toward fiver and fell again. fiver paid him
no heed, but looked from one to another among the rabbits. then he began
speaking again.
     "and then we came, over the heather in the night. wild rabbits, making
scrapes across the valley. the warren rabbits didn't show themselves at once.
they needed to think what was best to be done. but they hit on it quite soon. to

ashamed of his own, and who likes an open, honest tale from someone he's
deceiving? do you want me to go on? i tell you, every single thing that's happened
fits like a bee in a foxglove. and kill them, you say, and help ourselves to the great
burrow? we shall help ourselves to a roof of bones, hung with shining wires! help
ourselves to misery and death!"
     fiver sank down into the grass. bigwig, still trailing his horrible, smooth peg,
staggered up to him and touched his nose with his own.
     "i'm still alive, fiver," he said. "so are all of us. you've bitten through a bigger

peg than this one i'm dragging. tell us what to do."
     "do?" replied fiver. "why, go -- now. i told cowslip we were going before i left
the burrow."
     "where?" said bigwig. but it was hazel who answered.
     "to the hills," he said.

was the line of a cart track and beyond, a copse. hazel turned toward it and the
rest began to follow him up the slope in ones and twos.
     "what about the wire, bigwig?" said silver. "the peg will catch and tighten it
again."
     "no, it's loose now," said bigwig "i could shake it off if i hadn't hurt my neck."
     "try," said silver. "you won't get far otherwise."
     "hazel," said speedwell suddenly, "there's a rabbit coming down from the
warren. look!"
     "only one?" said bigwig. "what a pity! you take him, silver. i won't deprive
you. make a good job of it while you're at it."
     they stopped and waited, dotted here and there about the slope. the rabbit
who was coming was running in a curious, headlong manner. once he ran
straight into a thick-stemmed thistle, knocking himself sideways and rolling over
and over. but he got up and came blundering on toward them.
     "is it the white blindness?" said buckthorn. "he's not looking where he's
going."

ot of the turf cliff, hazel and his companions were crouching under
the low branches of two or three spindle trees. since the previous morning they
had journeyed nearly three miles. their luck had been good, for everyone who
had left the warren was still alive. they had splashed through two brooks and
wandered fearfully in the deep woodlands west of ecchinswell. they had rested in
the straw of a starveall, or lonely barn, and woken to find themselves attacked by
rats. silver and buckthorn, with bigwig helping them, had covered the retreat
until, once all were together outside, they had taken to flight. buckthorn had been
bitten in the foreleg, and the wound, in the manner of a rat bite, was irritant and
painful. skirting a small lake, they had stared to see a great gray fisher bird that
stabbed and paddled in the sedge, until a flight of wild duck had frightened them
away with their clamor. they had crossed more than half a mile of open pasture
without a trace of cover, expecting every momen

tenacious band who understood each other and worked together. there was no
more quarreling. the truth about the warren had been a grim shock. they had
come closer together, relying on and valuing each other's capacities. they knew
now that it was on these and on nothing else that their lives depended, and they
were not going to waste anything they possessed between them. in spite of
hazel's efforts beside the snare, there was not one of them who had not turned
sick at heart to think that bigwig was dead and wondered, like blackberry, what
would become of them now. without hazel, without blackberry, buckthorn and
pipkin -- bigwig would have died. without himself he would have died, for which
else, of them all, would not have stopped running after such punishment? there
was no more questioning of bigwig's strength, fiver's insight, blackberry's wits or
hazel's authority. when the rats came, buckthorn and silver had obeyed bigwig
and stood their ground. the rest had followed hazel when h

 strawberry had had a bad time. his misery made him slow-witted and careless
and he was ashamed of the part he had played at the warren. he was soft and
more used than he dared admit to indolence and good food. but he made no
complaint and it was plain that he was determined to show what he could do and
not to be left behind. he had proved useful in the woodland, being better
accustomed to thick woods than any of the others. "he'll be all right, you know, if
we give him a chance," said hazel to bigwig by the lake. "so he darned well ought
to be," replied bigwig, "the great dandy" -- for by their standards strawberry was
scrupulously clean and fastidious. "well, i won't have him brow-beaten, bigwig,
mind. that won't help him." this bigwig had accepted, though rather sulkily. yet
he himself had become less overbearing. the snare had left him weak and
overwrought. it was he who had given the alarm in the barn, for he could not
sleep and at the sound of scratching had started up at once. he woul

silver and buckthorn fight alone, but he had felt obliged to leave the worst of it to
them. for the first time in his life, bigwig had found himself driven to moderation

glazed and paralyzed by it -- "tharn," to use their own word. hazel and his
companions had been on the jump for nearly two days. indeed, ever since they
had left their home warren, five days before, they had faced one danger after
another. they were all on edge, sometimes starting at nothing and, again, lying
down in any patch of long grass that offered. bigwig and buckthorn smelled of
blood and everyone else knew they did. what bothered hazel, dandelion and
hawkbit was the openness and strangeness of the down and their inability to see
very far ahead. they climbed not over but through the sun-red grass, among the
awakened insect movement and the light ablaze. the grass undulated about
them. they peered over anthills and looked cautiously round clumps of teazle.

     "well, whether he has or not," said hazel, "we can't go on looking for him. the
others are waiting and they may be in danger. we must go down ourselves."
     "what a shame to lose him, though," said dandelion, "just when we'd reached
fiver's hills without losing anyone. he's such a duffer; we shouldn't have brought
him up. but how could anything have got hold of him here, without our seeing?"

     "no, he's gone back, for sure," said hazel. "i wonder what bigwig will say to
him? i hope he won't bite him again. we'd better get on."
     "are you going to bring them up tonight?" asked dandelion.
     "i don't know," said hazel. "it's a problem. where's the shelter to be found?"
     they made for the steep edge. the light was beginning to fail. they picked their
direction by a clump of stunted trees which they had passed on their way up.
these formed a kind of dry oasis -- a little feature common on the downs. half a

     the holes certainly were rough -- "just right for a lot of vagabonds* like us,"
said bigwig -- but the exhausted and those who wander in strange country are not
particular about therr quarters. at least there was room for twelve rabbits and the
burrows were dry. two of the runs -- the ones among the thorn trees -- led
straight down to burrows scooped out of the top of the chalk subsoil. rabbits do
not line their sleeping places and a hard, almost rocky floor is uncomfortable for
those not accustomed to it. the holes in the bank, however, had runs of the usual
bow shape, leading down t

you and i, and have a look at it?"
     they ran uphill to the summit. the beech hanger lay some little way off to the
southeast, on the far side of a grassy track that ran along the ridge.
     "there are some big trees there," said blackberry. "the roots must have broken
up the ground pretty deep. we could dig holes and be as well off as ever we were
in the old warren. but if bigwig and the others won't dig or say they can't -- well,
it's bare and bleak here. that's why it's lonely and safe, of course; but when bad
weather comes we shall be driven off the hills for sure."
     "it never entered my head to try to make a lot of bucks dig regular holes," said
hazel doubtfully, as they returned down the slope. "rabbit kittens need holes, of
course; but do we?"
     "we were all born in a warren that was dug before our mothers were born,"
said blackberry. "we're used to holes a

somewhere else, perhaps; but not here."
     "it'll mean a lot of work."
     "look, there's bigwig come up now and some of the others with him. why not
put it to them and see what they say?"
     during silflay, however, hazel mentioned blackberry's idea to no one but
fiver. later on, when most of the rabbits had finished feeding and were either
playing in the grass or lying in the sunshine, he suggested that they might go
across to the hanger -- "just to see what sort of a wood it is." bigwig and silver
agreed at once and in the end no one stayed behind.

 rabbits were perplexed.
they could not make out why the wood was so light and still and why they could
see so far between the trees. the continuous, gentle rustling of the beech leaves
was unlike the sounds to be heard in a copse of nut bushes, oak and silver birch.
     moving uncertainly in and out along the edge of the hanger, they came to the
northeast corner. here there was a bank from which they looked out over the
empty stretches of grass beyond. fiver, absurdly small beside the hulking bigwig,
turned to hazel with an air of happy confidence.
     "i'm sure blackberry's right, hazel," he said. "we ought to do our best to make
some holes here. i'm ready to try, anyway."
     the others were taken aback. pipkin, however, readily joined hazel at the foot
of the bank and soon two or three more began scratching at the light soil. the
digging was easy and although they often broke off to feed or merely to sit in the
sun, before midday hazel was out of sight and tunneling between the tree r

out northward toward the bright, still fields and the dim pylon line stalking away
into the distance north of kingsclere. the air was cooler and the sun was
beginning once more to reach the north escarpment.

     "i think we've done enough," he said, "for today, anyway. i should like to go
down to the bottom of the hill and find some really good grass. this stuff's all
right in its way but it's rather thin and dry. does anyone feel like coming with
me?"
     bigwig, dandelion and speedwell were ready, but the others preferred to graze
their way back to the thorn trees and go underground with the sun. bigwig and
hazel picked the line that offered most cover and, with the others following, set
out on the four or five hundred yards to the foot of the hill. they met no trouble
and were soon feeding in the grass at the edge of the wheatfield, the very picture
of rabbits in an evening landscape. hazel, tired though he was, did not forget to

o bolt if there should be an alarm. he was lucky enough to
come upon a short length of old, overgrown ditch, partly fallen in and so heavily
overhung with cow parsley and nettles that it was almost as sheltered as a tunnel;
and all four of them made sure that they could reach it quickly from the open.
     "that'll be good enough at a pinch," said bigwig, munching clover and sniffing
at the fallen bloom from a wayfaring tree. "my goodness, we've learned a few
things since we left the old warren, haven't we? more than we'd have learned in a
lifetime back there. and digging! it'll be flying next, i suppose. have you noticed
that this soil's quite different from the soil in the old warren? it smells differently
and it slides and falls quite differently, too."
     "that reminds me," said hazel. "i meant to ask you. there was one thing at

like to copy it. it's a wonderful idea to have a place underground where everybody
can be together -- talk and tell stories and so on. what do you think? could it be

     bigwig considered. "i know this," he said. "if you make a burrow too big the
roof starts falling in. so if you want a place like that you'll need something to hold
the roof up. what did cowslip have?"
     "tree roots."

     twilight had fallen over the cornfield, for although long red rays still lit the
upper down, the sun had set below. the uneven shadow of the hedge had faded
and disappeared. there was a cool smell of moisture and approaching darkness. a
cockchafer droned past. the grasshoppers had fallen silent.
     "owls'll be out," said bigwig. "let's go up again."
     at this moment, from out in the darkening field, there came the sound of a
stamp on the ground. it was followed by another, closer to them, and they caught
a glimpse of a white tail. they both immediately ran to the ditch. now that they
had to use it in earnest, they found it even narrower than they had thought. there
was just room to turn round at the far end and as they did so speedwell and
dandelion tumbled in behind them.
     "what is it?" asked hazel. "what did

     "did you see it?"
     "no, and i couldn't smell it either. it's downwind. but i heard it plainly
enough."
     "i heard it, too," said dandelion. "something fairly big -- as big as a rabbit,
anyway -- moving clumsily but trying to keep concealed, or so it seemed to me."
     "homba?"
     "no, that we should have smelled," said bigwig, "wind or no wind. from what
you say, it sounds like a cat. i hope it's not a stoat. hoi, hoi, u embleer hrair!
what a nuisance! we'd better sit tight for a bit. but get ready to bolt if it spots
us."
     they waited. soon it grew dark. only the faintest light came through the
tangled summer growth above them. the far end of the ditch was so much
overgrown that they could not see out of it, but the place where they had come in
showed as a patch of sky -- an arc of very dark blue. as the time p

it was you heard, we'd better not risk going out."
     "listen," said dandelion. "what's that?"
     for a moment hazel could hear nothing. then he caught a distant but clear
sound -- a kind of wailing or crying, wavering and intermittent. although it did
not sound like any sort of hunting call, it was so unnatural that it filled him with
fear. as he listened, it ceased.
     "what in frith's name makes a noise like that?" said bigwig, his great fur cap
hackling between his ears.
     "a cat?" said speedwell, wide-eyed.
     "that's no cat!" said bigwig, his lips drawn back in a stiffened, unnatural
grimace, "that's no cat! don't you know what it is? your mother--" he broke off.
then he said, very low, "your mother told you, didn't she?"
     "no!" cried dandelion. "no! it's some bird -- some rat -- wounded--"
     bigwig stood up. his back was arched and his head nodded on his stiffened
neck.

of the narrow cut.
     suddenly the noise sounded again, nearer: and now there could be no mistake.
what they heard was the voice of a rabbit, but changed out of all recognition. it
might have come from the cold spaces of the dark sky outside, so unearthly and
desolate was the sound. at first there was only a wailing. then, distinct and
beyond mistaking, they heard -- they all heard -- words.
     "zorn! zorn!"* cried the dreadful, squealing voice. "all dead! o zorn!"
     dandelion whimpered. bigwig was scuffling into the ground.
     "be quiet!" said hazel. "and stop kicking that earth over me! i want to listen,"
     at that moment, quite distinctly, the voice cried, "thlayli! o thlayli!"
     at this, all four rabbits felt the trance of utter panic. they grew rigid. then

bigwig, his eyes set in a fixed, glazed stare, began to jerk his way up the ditch
toward the opening. "you have to go," he muttered, so thickly that hazel could
hardly catch the words. "you have to go when he calls yo

u."
     hazel felt so much frightened that he could no longer collect his wits. as on the
riverbank, his surroundings became unreal and dream-like. who -- or what -- was
calling bigwig by name? how could any living creature in this place know his
name? only one idea remained to him -- bigwig must be prevented from going
out, for he was helpless. he scrambled past him, pressing him against the side of
the ditch.
     "stay where you are," he said, panting, "whatever sort of rabbit it is, i'm going
to see for myself." then, his legs almost giving way beneath him, he pulled
himself out into the open.
     for a few moments he could see little or nothing; but the smells of dew and
elder bloom were unchanged and his nose brushed against cool grass blades. he
sat up and looked about him.

exhaustion, its back legs trailing behind its flattened rump as though
paralyzed: a rabbit that stared, white-eyed, from one side to the other, seeing
nothing, yet finding no respite from its fear, and then fell to licking wretchedly at
one ripped and bloody ear that drooped across its face: a rabbit that suddenly
cried and wailed as though entreating the thousand to come from every quarter
to rid it of a misery too terrible to be borne.
     it was captain holly of the sandleford owsla.

     *bigwig's word was hlessil, which i have rendered in various places in the story
as wanderers, scratchers, vagabonds. a hlessi is a rabbit living in the open,
without a hole. solitary bucks and unmated rabbits who are wandering do this for
quite long periods, especially in summer. bucks do not usually dig much in any
case, although they will scratch shallow shelters or make use of existing holes
where these are available. real digging is done for the most part by does
preparing for litters.

   in the sandleford warren, holly had been a rabbit of consequence. he was
greatly relied upon by the threarah and had more than once carried out difficult
orders with a good deal of courage. during the early spring, when a fox had
moved into a neighboring copse, holly, with two or three volunteers, had kept it
steadily under observation for several days and reported all its movements, until
one evening it left as suddenly as it had come. although he had decided on his
own initiative to arrest bigwig, he had not the reputation of being vindictive. he
was, rather, a stander of no nonsense who knew when duty was done and did it
himself. sound, unassuming, conscientious, a bit lacking in the rabbit sense of
mischief, he was something of the born second-in-command. there could have
been no question of trying to persuade him to leave the warren with hazel and
fiver. to find him under watership down at all, therefore, was astonishing
enough. but to find him in such a condition was all but incredi

uld have reduced him -- of all rabbits -- to this state?
     hazel pulled himself together. whatever the explanation might be, the
immediate need was to take first things first. they were in open country, at night,
away from any refuge but an overgrown ditch, with a rabbit who smelled of blood,
was crying uncontrollably and looked as though he could not move. there might
very well be a stoat on his trail at this moment. if they were going to help him
they had better be quick.
     "go and tell bigwig who it is," he said to dandelion, "and come back with him.
send speedwell up the hill to the others and tell him to make it clear that no one
is to come down. they couldn't help and it would only add to the risk."
     dandelion had no sooner gone than hazel became aware that something else
was moving in the hedge. but he had no time to wonder what it might be, for
almost immediately another rabbit appeared and limped to where holly was
lying.
     "you must help us if you can," he said to haze

l. "we've had a very bad time and
my master's ill. can we get underground here?"
     hazel recognized him as one of the rabbits who had come to arrest bigwig, but
he did not know his name.
     "why did you stay in the hedge and leave him to crawl about in the open?" he
asked.
     "i ran away when i heard you coming," replied the other rabbit. "i couldn't get
the captain to move. i thought you were elil and there was no point in staying to
be killed. i don't think i could fight a field mouse."
     "do you know me?" said hazel. but before the other could answer, dandelion
and bigwig came out of the darkness. bigwig stared at holly for a moment and

then crouched before him and touched noses.

     "holly, this is thlayli," he said. "you were calling me."
     holly did not answer, but only stared fixedly back at him. bigwig looked up.
"who's that who came with him?" he said. "oh, it's you, bluebell. how many
more of you?"
     "no more," said bluebell. he was about to go on when holly spoke.
     "thlayli," he said. "so we have found you."
     he sat up with difficulty and looked around at them.
     "you're hazel, aren't you?" he asked. "and that's -- oh, i should know, but i'm
in very poor shape, i'm afraid."
     "it's dandelion," said hazel. "listen -- i can see that you're exhausted, but we
can't stay here.

"
     hazel looked at him sharply, but holly replied, "well?"
     "it said, 'look, there's a rabbit! we're in danger!'"
     "this is no time--" began hazel.
     "don't silence him," said holly. "we wouldn't be here at all without his blue
tit's chatter. yes, i can go now. is it far?"
     "not too far," said hazel, thinking it all too likely that holly would never get
there.
     it took a long time to climb the hill. hazel made them separate, himself
remaining with holly and bluebell while bigwig and dandelion went out to either
side. holly was forced to stop several times and hazel, full of fear, had hard work
to suppress his impatience. only when the moon began to rise -- the edge of its
great disc growing brighter and brighter on the skyline below and behind them --
did he at last beg holly to hurry. as he spoke he saw, in the white light, pipkin
coming down to meet them.
     "what are you doing?" he said sternly. "i told speedwell no one was to come
down."
     "it isn't speedwell'

thought i'd come and look for you, hazel. anyway, the holes are just here. is it
really captain holly you've found?"
     bigwig and dandelion approached.
     "i'll tell you what," said bigwig. "these two will need to rest for a good long
time. suppose pipkin here and dandelion take them to an empty burrow and stay
with them as long as they want? the rest of us had better keep away until they
feel better."
     "yes, that's best," said hazel. "i'll go up with you now."
     they ran the short distance to the thorn trees. all the other rabbits were above
ground, waiting and whispering together.
     "shut up," said bigwig, before anyone had asked a question. "yes, it is holly,

myself and so will you if you've got any sense."
     but before he went, bigwig turned to hazel and said, "you got yourself out of
that ditch down there instead of me, didn't you, hazel? i shan't forget that."
     hazel remembered buckthorn's leg and took him down with him. speedwell

 strawberry about the great
burrow and learned that its ceiling, as well as being vaulted with a tangle of
fibers, was strengthened by roots going vertically down into the floor. he
remarked that he had not noticed these.
     "there aren't many, but they're important," said strawberry. "they take a lot of
the load. if it weren't for those roots the ceiling would fall after heavy rain. on
stormy nights you could sense the extra weight in the earth above, but there was
no danger."
     hazel and bigwig went underground with him. the beginnings of the new
warren had been hollowed out among the roots of one of the beech trees. it was
still no more than a small, irregular cave with one entrance. they set to work to
enlarge it, digging between the roots and tunneling upward to make a second run
that would emerge inside the wood. after a time strawberry stopped digging and
began moving about between the roots, sniffing, biting and scuffling in the soil
with his front paws. hazel supposed that he w

lit grass beyond. the kestrel sailed into view and took
up station, the black-edged flange of its tail bent down and its pointed wings
beating rapidly as it searched the down below.
     "but do you think it would attack us?" asked hazel, watching it drop lower and
recommence its poised fluttering. "surely it's too small?"
     "you're probably right," replied silver. "all the same, would you care to go out
there and start feeding?"
     "i'd like to try standing up to some of these elil," said bigwig, who had come up
the run behind them. "we're afraid of too many. but a bird from the air would be
awkward, especially if it came fast. it might get the better of even a big rabbit if it
took him by surprise."
     "see the mouse?" said silver suddenly. "there, look. poor little beast."
     they could all see the field mouse, which was exposed in a patch of smooth
grass. it had evidently strayed too far from its hole and now could not tell what to
do. the kestrel's shadow had not passed over it

, but the rabbits' sudden
disappearance had made it uneasy and it was pressed to the ground, looking
uncertainly this way and that. the kestrel had not yet seen it, but could hardly fail
to do so as soon as it moved.
     "any moment now," said bigwig callously.
     on an impulse, hazel hopped down the bank and went a little way into the
open grass. mice do not speak lapine, but there is a very simple, limited lingua
franca of the hedgerow and woodland. hazel used it now.
     "run," he said. "here; quick."
     the mouse looked at him, but did not move. hazel spoke again and the mouse
began suddenly to run toward him as the kestrel turned and slid sideways and
downward. hazel hastened back to the hole. looking out, he saw the mouse

moment the kestrel, all beak and talons, hit the loose earth
immediately outside like a missile thrown from the tree above. it scuffled
savagely and for an instant the three rabbits saw its round, dark eyes looking

straight down the run. then it was gone. the speed and force of the pounce, not a
length away, were terrifying and hazel leaped backward, knocking silver off his
balance. they picked themselves up in silence.
     "like to try standing up to that one?" said silver, looking round at bigwig. "let
me know when. i"ll come and watch."
     "hazel," said bigwig, "i know you're not stupid, but what did we get out of
that? are you going in for protecting every mole and shrew that can't get
underground?"
     the mouse had not moved. it was still crouching a little inside the run, on a
level with their heads and outlined against the light. hazel could see it watching
him.
     "perhaps hawk not gone," he said. "you stay now. go later."
     bigwig was about to speak again when dandelion

rying. i thought he was
going out of his mind. pipkin kept talking to him -- he was first-rate -- and he
seems to set a lot of store by bluebell. bluebell kept on making jokes. he was
worn out before the morning and so were the lot of us -- we've been sleeping all
day. holly's been more or less himself since he woke up this afternoon, and he's
been up to silflay. he asked where you and the others would be tonight and, as i
didn't know, i came to ask."
     "is he fit to talk to us, then?" asked bigwig.
     "i think so. it would be the best thing for him, if i'm any judge: and if he was
with all of us together he'd be less likely to have another bad night."
     "well, where are we going to sleep?" said silver.
     hazel considered. the honeycomb was still rough-dug and half finished, but it
would probably be as comfortable as the holes under the thorn trees. besides, if it
proved otherwise, they would have all the more inducement to improve it. to
know that they were actually making use of

 their day's hard work would please
everybody and they were likely to prefer this to a third night in the chalk holes.
     "i should think here," he said. "but we'll see how the others feel."
     "what's this mouse doing in here?" asked dandelion.
     hazel explained. dandelion was as puzzled as bigwig had been.
     "well, i'll admit i hadn't any particular idea when i went out to help it," said
hazel. "i have now, though, and i'll explain later what it is. but, first of all, bigwig
and i ought to go and talk to holly. and, dandelion, you go and tell the rest what
you told me, will you, and see what they want to do tonight?"
     they found holly with bluebell and pipkin, on the turf by the anthill where
dandelion had first looked over the down. holly was sniffing at a purple orchis.
the head of mauve blooms rocked gently on its stem as he pushed his nose
against it.
     "don't frighten it, master," said bluebell. "it might fly away. after all, it's got a

one to eat, but at least there's plenty of burnet and that's always good." a fly
settled on his wounded ear and he winced and shook his head.
     hazel was glad to see that holly was evidently in better spirits. he began to say
that he hoped he felt well enough to join the others, but holly soon interrupted
him with questions.
     "are there many of you?" he asked.
     "hrair," said bigwig.
     "all that left the warren with you?"
     "every one," replied hazel proudly.
     "no one hurt?"
     "oh, several have been hurt, one way and another."
     "never a dull moment, really," said bigwig.
     "who's this coming? i don't know him."
     strawberry came running down from the hanger and as he joined them began
to make the same curious dancing gesture of head and forepaws which they had
first seen in the rainy meadow before they entered the great burrow. he checked
himself in

some confusion and, to forestall bigwig's rebuke, spoke to hazel at
once.
     "hazel-rah," he said (holly looked startled, but said nothing), "everyone wants
to stay in the new warren tonight: and they're all hoping that captain holly will
feel able to tell them what's happened and how he came here."
     "well, naturally, we all want to know," said hazel to holly. "this is strawberry.
he joined us on our journey and we've been glad to have him. but do you think
you can manage it?"
     "i can manage it," said holly. "but i must war

 you've had a rough time."
     "it hasn't been easy," answered silver. "hazel's done wonders and we owe a lot
to fiver here as well."
     "i've heard of you," said holly, turning to fiver. "you're the rabbit who saw it
all coming. you talked to the threarah, didn't you?"
     "he talked to me," said fiver.
     "if only he'd listened to you! well, it can't be changed now, till acorns grow on
thistles. silver, there's something i want to say and i can say it more easily to you
than to hazel or bigwig. i'm not out to make any trouble here -- trouble for hazel,
i mean. he's your chief rabbit now, that's plain. i hardly know him, but he must
be good or you'd all be dead; and this is no time to be squabbling. if any of the
other rabbits are wondering whether i might want to alter things, will you let
them know that i shan't?"
     "yes, i will," said silver.
     bigwig came up. "i know it's not owl time yet," he said, "but everyone's so

     "underground?" replied holly. "but how can you all hear me underground? i

     "come and see," said bigwig.
     holly and bluebell were impressed by the honeycomb.
     "this is something quite new," said holly. "what keeps the roof up?"
     "it doesn't need to be kept up," said bluebell. "it's right up the hill already."
     "an idea we found on the way," said bigwig.
     "lying in a field," said bluebell. "it's all right, master, i'll be quiet while you're
speaking."
     "yes, you must," said holly. "soon no one will want jokes."
     almost all the rabbits had followed them down. the honeycomb, though big
enough for everybody, was not so airy as the great burrow and on this june
evening it seemed somewhat close.

     "up the run."
     hazel went up. the mouse was waiting at the top.
     "you go now?" said hazel. "you think safe?"
     "go now," said the mouse. "no wait owl. but a what i like a say. you 'elp a

     "frith in a pond!" muttered bigwig, further down the run. "and so will all his
brothers and sisters. i dare say the place'll be crawling. why don't you ask them
to dig us a burrow or two, hazel?"
     hazel watched the mouse make off into the long grass. then he returned to the
honeycomb and settled down near holly, who had just begun to speak.

very frightening and i would have run myself, but i kept waiting to see whether

other rabbits in the wood. pine needles was there, i remember, and butterbur
and ash. i got hold of all i could and told them to sit tight under cover.
     "after a long time the men finished. they took the bramble things out of the
holes and the boy put the bodies on a stick--"
     holly stopped and pressed his nose under bigwig's flank.
     "well, never mind about that bit," said hazel in a steady voice. "tell us how
you came away."
     "before that happened," said holly, "a great hrududu came into the field from
the lane. it wasn't the one the men came in. it was very noisy and it was yellow --
as yellow as charlock: and in front there was a great silver, shining thing that it
held in its huge front paws. i don't know how to describe it to you. it looked like

collecting other rabbits, but there were three who joined me all the same --
bluebell here and pimpernel and young toadflax. toadflax was the only member
of the owsla i'd seen and i asked him about the threarah, but he couldn't talk any

kind of sense. i never found out what happened to the threarah. i hope he died
quickly.
     "pimpernel was light-headed -- chattering nonsense -- and bluebell and i
weren't much better. for some reason all i could think of was bigwig. i
remembed how i'd gone to arrest him -- to kill him, really -- and i felt i had to
find him and tell him i'd been wrong: and this idea was all the sense i had left.

couldn't see that they had any reason to wish us harm, so i told him that we'd had
a bad time and come a long way and that we were looking for some rabbits from
our warren -- hazel, fiver and bigwig. as soon as i said those names this rabbit
turned to the others and cried, 'i knew it! tear them to pieces!' and they all set on
us. one of them got me by the ear and ripped it up before bluebell could pull him
off. we were fighting the lot of them. i was so much taken by surprise that i

"hraka one end, jokes the other," said bluebell. "i used to roll a joke along the
ground and we both followed it. that was how we kept going."

terribly painful and all the time i kept thinking that pimpernel's death was my
fault. if i hadn't gone to sleep he wouldn't have died. once we tried to sleep again,
but my dreams were more than i could bear. i was out of my mind, really. i had
only this one idea -- to find bigwig and tell him that he'd been right to leave the
warren.

the open and i know i was really hoping that the elil would come and make an

that i must be dead, but then i began to wonder whether he was real or not. well,

     rabbits (says mr. lockley) are like human beings in many ways. one of these
is certainly their staunch ability to withstand disaster and to let the stream of
their life carry them along, past reaches of terror and loss. they have a certain

     "what do you think?" said silver to blackberry.
     "i think it's a good idea, but real opportunities of the kind hazel has in mind
aren't likely to come very often."
     "i think that's about right," said holly, wincing as silver resumed licking. "the
idea's all right as far as it goes, but it won't come to a great deal in practice."
     "i'm ready to give it a try," said silver. "i reckon it'll be worth it, just to see
bigwig telling bedtime stories to a mole."
     "el-ahrairah did it once," said bluebell, "and it worked. do you remember?"
     "no," said hazel, "i don't know that story. let's have it."
     "let's silflay first," said holly. "this ear's had all i can stand for the time
being."
     "well, at least it's clean now," said hazel. "but i'm afraid it'll never be as good
as the other, you know. you'll have a ragged ear."
     "never mind," said holly. "i'm still one of the lucky ones."

were thawing snow about to slide from a sloping roof. then the whole down and
all below it, earth and air, gave way to the sunrise. as a bull, with a slight but
irresistible movement, tosses its head from the grasp of a man who is leaning over
the stall and idly holding its horn, so the sun entered the world in smooth,
gigantic power. nothing interrupted or obscured its coming. without a sound, the
leaves shone and the grass coruscated along the miles of the escarpment.
     outside the wood, bigwig and silver combed their ears, sniffed the air and
hopped away, following their own long shadows to the grass of the gallop. as they
moved over the short turf -- nibbling, sitting up and looking round them -- they
approached a little hollow, no more than three feet across. before they reached
the edge bigwig, who was ahead of silver, checked and crouched, staring.
although he could not see into the hollow, he knew that there was some creature
in it -- something fairly big. peering through the bl

ades of grass round his head,
he could see the curve of a white back. whatever the creature was, it was nearly as
big as himself. he waited, stock still, for some little time, but it did not move.
     "what has a white back, silver?" whispered bigwig.
     silver considered. "a cat?"
     "no cats here."
     "how do you know?"
     at that moment they both heard a low, breathy hissing from the hollow. it
lasted for a few moments. then there was silence once more.
     bigwig and silver had a good opinion of themselves. apart from holly, they
were the only survivors of the sandleford owsla and they knew that their
comrades looked up to them. the encounter with the rats in the barn had been no
joke and had proved their worth. bigwig, who was generous and honest, had
never for a moment resented hazel's courage on the night when his own
superstitious fear had got the better of him. but the idea of going back to the
honeycomb and reporting that he had glimpsed an unknow

ogether over the tail. the head was very dark
brown -- almost black -- in such sharp contrast to the white neck that the bird
looked as though it were wearing a kind of hood. the one dark red leg that they
could see ended in a webbed foot and three powerful, taloned toes. the beak,
hooked slightly downward at the end, was strong and sharp. as they stared, it
opened, disclosing a red mouth and throat. the bird hissed savagely and tried to
strike, but still it did not move.
     "it's hurt," said bigwig.
     "yes, you can tell that," replied silver. "but it's not wounded anywhere that i
can see. i'll go round--"
     "look out!" said bigwig. "he'll have you!"
     silver, as he started to move round the hollow, had come closer to the bird's
head. he jumped back just in time to avoid a quick, darting blow of the beak.
     "that would have broken your foot," said bigwig.
     as they squatted, looking at the bird -- for they both sensed intuitively that it
would not rise -- it suddenly burst i

nto loud, raucous cries -- "yark! yark!
yark!" -- a tremendous sound at close quarters -- that split the morning and
carried far across the down. bigwig and silver turned and ran.
     they collected themselves sufficiently to pull up short of the wood and make a
more dignified approach to the bank. hazel came to meet them in the grass.
there was no mistaking their wide eyes and dilated nostrils.
     "elil?" asked hazel.
     "well, i'm blessed if i know, to tell you the truth," replied bigwig. "there's a
great bird out there, like nothing i've ever seen."
     "how big? as big as a pheasant?"
     "not quite so big," admitted bigwig, "but bigger than a wood pigeon: and a lot
fiercer."
     "is that what cried?"
     "yes. it startled me, all right. we were actually beside it. but for some reason
or other it can't move."
     "dying?"
     "i don't think so."
     "i'll go and have a look at it," said hazel.
     "it's savage. for goodness' sake be careful."

     "come keel -- kah! kah! -- you come keel -- yark! -- t'ink me finish -- me no

then, unexpectedly, the bird began to drive its beak into the ground. they

noticed for the first time that the grass in front of it was torn and scored with
lines. for some moments it stabbed here and there, then gave up, lifted its head
and watched them again.
     "i believe it's starving," said hazel. "we'd better feed it. bigwig, go and get
some worms or something, there's a good fellow."
     "er -- what did you say, hazel?"
     "worms."
     "me dig for worms?"
     "didn't the owsla teach -- oh, all right, i'll do it," said hazel. "you and silver
wait here."
     after a few moments, however, bigwig followed hazel back to the ditch and
began to join him in scratching at the dry ground. worms are not plentiful on the
downs and there had been no rain for days. after a time bigwig looked up.
     "what about beetles? 
 
 ___________________________
 
wood lice? something like that?"
     they found some rotten sticks and carried them back. hazel pushed one
forward cautiously.
     "insects."
     the bird split the stick three ways in as many seconds and snapped up the few
insects inside. soon there was a small pile of debris in the hollow as the rabbits
brought anything from which it could get food. bigwig found some horse dung
along the track, dug the worms out of it, overcame his disgust and carried them
one by one. when hazel praised him, he muttered something about "the first
time any rabbit's done this and don't tell the blackbirds." at last, long after they
had all grown weary, the bird stopped feeding and looked at hazel.
     "finish eat." it paused. "vat for you do?"
     "you hurt?" said hazel.
     the bird looked crafty. "no hurt. plenty fight. stay small time, den go."
     "you stay

     "damn de lot. fight plenty."
     "i bet it would, too," said bigwig, looking with admiration at the two-inch beak
and thick neck.
     "we no want you finish," said hazel. "you stay here you finish. we help you
maybe."
     "piss off!"
     "come on," said hazel immediately to the others. "let it alone." he began to
lollop back to the wood. "let it try keeping the kestrels off for a bit."
     "what's the idea, hazel?" said silver. "that's a savage brute. you can't make a
friend out of that."
     "you may be right," said hazel. "but what's the good of a blue t

the great, arching span. but at once it closed them again, grimacing with pain.
     "ving no good. i come."
     it followed hazel docilely enough across the grass, but he was careful to keep
out of its reach. their arrival outside the wood caused something of a sensation,
which hazel cut short with a peremptory sharpness quite unlike his usual
manner.
     "come on, get busy," he said to dandelion and buckthorn. "this bird's hurt
and we're going to shelter it until it's better. ask bigwig to show you how to get it
some food. it eats worms and insects. try grasshoppers, spiders -- anything.
hawkbit! acorn! yes, and you too, fiver -- come out of that rapt trance, or
whatever you're in. we need an open, wide hole, broader than it's deep, with a flat
floor a little below the level of the entrance: by nightfall."
     "we've been digging all the afternoon, hazel--"
     "i know. i'll come and help you," said hazel, "in just a little while. only get
started. the night's coming."

the astonished rabbits obeyed him, grumbling. hazel's authority was put to
something of a test, but held firm with the support of bigwig. although he had no
idea what hazel had in mind, bigwig was fascinated by the strength and courage
of the bird and had already accepted the idea of taking it in, without troubling
himself about the reason. he led the digging while hazel explained to the bird, as
well as he could, how they lived, their ways of protecting themselves from the
enemies and the kind of shelter they could provide. the amount of food the
rabbits produced was not very large, but once inside the wood the bird clearly felt
safer and was able to hobble about and do some foragin

g for itself.
     by owl time bigwig and his helpers had scratched out a kind of lobby inside the
entrance to one of the runs leading down from the wood. they lined the floor
with beech twigs and leaves. as darkness began to fall, the bird was installed. it

was still suspicious, but seemed to be in a good deal of pain. evidently, since it
could not think of any better plan for itself, it was ready to try a rabbit hole to
save its life. from outside, they could see its dark head alert in the gloom, the
black eyes still watchful.

s. they live in colonies where they forage and
feed, chatter and fight all day long. solitude and reticence are unnatural to them.
they move southward in the breeding season and at such times a wounded one is
only too likely to find itself deserted. the gull's savagery and suspicion had been
due partly to pain and partly to the unnerving knowledge that it had no
companions and could not fly. by the following morning its natural instincts to
mix with a flock and to talk were beginning to return. bigwig made himself its
companion. he would not hear of the gull going out to forage. before ni-frith the
rabbits had managed to produce as much as it could eat -- for a time, at all events
-- and were able to sleep through the heat of the day. bigwig, however, remained
with the gull, making no secret of his admiration, talking and listening to it for
several hours. at the evening feed he joined hazel and holly near the bank where
bluebell had told his story of el-ahrairah.
     "how's the bird now?" 
 
 ___________________________
 
asked hazel.
     "a good deal better, i think," replied bigwig. "he's very tough, you know. my
goodness, what a life he's had! you don't know what you're missing! i could sit
and listen to him all day."
     "how was it hurt?"
     "a cat jumped on him in a farmyard. he never heard it until the last moment.
it tore the muscle of one of his wings, but apparently he gave it something to
remember before he made off. then he got himself up here somehow or other and
just collapsed. think of standing up to a cat! i can see now that i haven't really
started yet. 
 
 ___________________________
 
why shouldn't a rabbit stand up to a cat? let's just suppose that--"
     "but what is this bird?" interrupted holly.
     "well, i can't quite make out," answered bigwig. "but if i understand him
properly -- and i'm not at all sure that i do -- he says that where he comes from
there are thousands of his kind -- more than we can possibly imagine. their flocks
make the whole air white and in the breeding season their nests are like leaves in
a wood -- so he says."
     "but where? i've never seen one, even."
     "he says," said bigwig, looking very straight at holly, "he says that a long way
from here the earth stops and there isn't any more."
     "well, obviou
 
 ___________________________
 
sly it stops somewhere. what is there beyond?"
     "water."
     "a river, you mean?"
     "no," said bigwig, "not a river. he says there's a vast place of water, going on
and on. you can't see to the other side. there isn't another side. at least there is,
because he's been there. oh, i don't know -- i must admit i can't altogether
understand it."
     "was it telling you that it's been outside the world and come back again? that
must be untrue."
     "i don't know," said bigwig, "but i'm sure he's not lying. this water,

apparently, moves all the time and keeps breaking against the earth: and when he
can't hear that, he misses it. that's his name -- kehaar. it's the noise the water
makes."
     the others were impressed in spite of themselves.
     "well, why's it here?" asked hazel.
     "he shouldn't be. he ought to have been off to this big water place a long time
ago, to breed. apparently a lot of them come away in winter, because it gets so
cold and wild. then t

down. whatever might lie ahead, at least he could feel that he had not failed them
so far.
     "we're doing well here," he began, "or so it seems to me. we're certainly not a
bunch of hlessil any more. but all the same, there's something on my mind. i'm
surprised, as a matter of fact, that i should be the first one of us to start thinking
about it. unless we can find the answer, then this warren's as good as finished, in
spite of all we've done."
     "why, how can that be, hazel?" said bigwig.
     "do you remember nildro-hain?" asked hazel.
     "she stopped running. poor strawberry."
     "i know. and we have no does -- not one -- and no does means no kittens and
in a few years no warren."
     it may seem incredible that the rabbits had given no thought to so vital a
matter. but men have made the same mistake more than once -- left the whole
business out of account, or been content to trust to luck and the fortune of war.
rabbits live close to death and when death comes closer th

     "i'll tell you how," said hazel "the bird. the bird will go and search for us."
     "hazel-rah," cried blackberry, "what a marvelous idea! that bird could find out
in a day what we couldn't discover for ourselves in a thousand! but are you
certain it can be persuaded to do it? surely as soon as it gets better if it'll simply
fly away and leave us?"
     "i can't tell," answered hazel. "all we can do is feed it and hope for the best.
but, bigwig, since you seem to be getting on with it so well, perhaps you can
explain to it how much this means to us. it has only to fly over the downs and let
us know what it sees."
     "you leave him to me," said bigwig. "i think i know how to do it."
     hazel's anxiety and the reason for it were soon known to all the rabbits and
there was not one who did not realize what they were up against. there was
nothing very startling in what he had said. he was simply the one -- as a chief

lat all day, turning it to a dull,
damascene silver. the great branches of the beeches moved little, but spoke
loudly. there were squalls of rain on the wind. the weather made kehaar restless.
he walked about a good deal, watched the flying clouds and snapped up
everything the foragers brought. searching became harder, for in the wet the
insects burrowed into the deep grass and had to be scratched out.
     one afternoon hazel, who now shared a burrow with fiver as in the old days,
was woken by bigwig to be told that kehaar had something to say to him. he
made his way to kehaar's lobby without coming above ground. the first thing he
noticed was that the gull's head was molting and turning white, though a dark

brown patch remained behind each eye. hazel greeted him and was surprised to
be answered in a few words of halting, broken lapine. evidently kehaar had
prepared a short speech.
     "meester 'azel, ees rabbits vork 'ard," said kehaar. "i no finish now. soon i go
fine."
     "that's go

now. eggs come."
     "i'm sorry."
     "nudder time i get mudder. now i fly for you."
     "we'll do everything we possibly can to help you."
     the next day the wind dropped and kehaar made one or two short flights.
however, it was not until three days later that he felt able to set out on his search.
it was a perfect june morning. he was snapping up numbers of the little white-
shelled downland snails from the wet grass and cracking them in his great beak,
when he suddenly turned to bigwig and said,
     "now i fly for you,"
     he opened his wings. the two-foot span arched above bigwig, who sat
perfectly still while the white feathers beat the air round his head in a kind of
ceremonious farewell. laying his ears flat in the fanned draft, he stared up at
kehaar as the gull rose, rather heavily, into the air. when he flew, his body, so
long and graceful on the ground, took on the appearance of a thick, stumpy
cylinder, from the front of which his red beak projected between his ro

eyes. for a few moments he hovered, his body rising and falling between his
wings. then he began to climb, sailed sideways over the grass and disappeared
northward below the edge of the escarpment. bigwig returned to the hanger with
the news that kehaar had set out.
     the gull was away several days -- longer than the rabbits had expected. hazel
could not help wondering whether he really would return, for he knew that
kehaar, like themselves, felt the mating urge and he thought it quite likely that
after all he would be off to the big water and the raucous, teeming gull colonies
of which he had spoken with such feeling to bigwig. as far as he was able, he kept
his anxiety to himself, but one d

ay when they were alone, he asked fiver whether
he thought kehaar would return.
     "he will return," said fiver unhesitatingly.
     "and what will he bring with him?"
     "how can i tell?" replied fiver. but later, when they were underground, silent
and drowsy, he said suddenly, "the gifts of el-ahrairah. trickery; great danger;

and blessing for the warren." when hazel questioned him again, he seemed to be
unaware that he had spoken and could add nothing more.
     bigwig spent most of the hours of daylight watching for kehaar's return. he
was inclined to be surly and short, and once, when bluebell remarked that he
thought meester pigvig's fur cap was molting in sympathy for absent friends, he
showed a flash of his old sergeant-major spirit and cuffed and abused him twice
round the honeycomb, until holly intervened to save his faithful jester from
further trouble.
     it was late one afternoon, with a light north wind blowing and the smell of hay
drifting up fr
 
 ___________________________
 
om the fields of sydmonton, when bigwig came hurtling down into
the honeycomb to announce that kehaar was back. hazel suppressed his
excitement and told everyone to keep out of the way while he went to see him
alone. on second thoughts, however, he took fiver and bigwig with him.
     the three of them found kehaar back in his lobby. it was full of droppings,
messy and malodorous. rabbits will not excrete underground and kehaar's habit
of fouling his own nest had always disgusted hazel. now, in his eagerness to hear
his news, the guano smell seemed almost welcome.
     "glad to see you back, kehaar," he said. "are you tired?"
     "ving 'e still go tired. fly liddle bit, stop liddle bit, everyt'ing go fine."
     "are you hungry? shall we get you some insects?

"
     "fine. fine. good fellas. plenty beetle." (all insects were "beetle" to kehaar.)
     clearly, he had missed their attentions and was ready to enjoy being back.
although he no longer needed to have food brought to the lobby, he evidently felt
that he deserved it. bigwig went to get his foragers and kehaar kept them busy
until sunset at last he looked shrewdly at fiver and said,
     "eh, meester liddle von, you know vat i pring, ya?"
     "i've no idea," replied fiver, rather shortly.
     "den i tell. all dis peeg 'ill, i go along 'im, dis vay, dat vay, vere sun come up,

 was becoming clear and unanimous. by the following day hazel saw it plain. it
so happened that the time for speaking came when he was sitting on the bank at
sunrise, with fiver and three or four others. there was no need to summon a
general gathering. the thing was settled. when it reached them, those who were
not there would accept what he had said without having heard him at all.
     "this warren that kehaar found," said hazel, "he said it was big."
     "so we can't take it by force," said bigwig.
     "i don't think i want to go and join it," said hazel. "do you?"
     "and leave here?" replied dandelion. "after all our work? besides, i reckon
we'd have a thin time. no, i'm sure none of us wants to do that."
     "what we want is to get some does and bring them back here," said hazel.

"will that be difficult, do you think?"
     "i should have thought not," said holly. "big warrens are often overcrowded
and some of the rabbits can't get enough to eat. the young does get edgy and

anyway -- holly is. he knows everything about moving in the open and he'll be
able to talk well when he gets there."
     no one contradicted this. holly was the obvious choice, but to select his
companions was less easy. everyone was ready to go, but the business was so
important that at last they considered each rabbit in turn, discussing who would
be the most likely to survive the long journey, to arrive in good shape and to go
down well in a strange warren. bigwig, rejected on the grounds that he might
quarrel in strange company, was inclined to be sulky at first, but came round
when he remembered that he could go on looking after kehaar. holly himself
wanted to take bluebell but, as blackberry said, one funny joke at the expense of
the chief rabbit might ruin everything. finally they chose silver, buckthorn and
strawberry. strawberry said little, but was obviously very much pleased. he had
suffered a good deal to show that he was no coward and now he ha

     they started early in the morning, in the gray light. kehaar had undertaken to
fly out later in the day, to make sure they were going in the right direction and
bring back news of their progress. hazel and bigwig went with them to the
southern end of the hanger and watched as they slipped away, heading to the west
of the distant farm. holly seemed confident and the other three were in high
spirits. soon they were lost to sight in the grass and hazel and bigwig turned back
into the wood.
     "well, we've done the best we can," said hazel. "the rest's up to them and to
el-ahrairah now. but surely it ought to be all right?"
     "not a doubt of it," said bigwig. "let's hope they're back soon. i'm looking

and restless. everything was going well. kehaar had found holly during the
afternoon and corrected his line a little to the west. he had left him in the shelter
of a thick hedge, sure of his course for the big warren. it seemed certain now that
two days would be enough for the journey. bigwig and some of the other rabbits
had already begun enlarging their burrows in preparation for holly's return.
kehaar had had a violent quarrel with a kestrel, screaming insults in a voice fit to
startle a cornish harbor: and although it had ended inconclusively, the kestrel
seemed likely to regard the neighborhood of the hanger with healthy respect for
the future. things had not looked better since they had first set out from
sandleford.
     a spirit of happy mischief entered into hazel. he felt

? why was he going to the farm? hazel
finished the last of the burnet and answered himself in the starlight. "i'll just have
a look round," he said, "and if i can find those box rabbits i'll try to talk to them;
nothing more than that. i'm not going to take any risks -- well, not real risks --
not until i see whether it's worth it, anyway."
     should he go alone? it would be safer and more pleasant to take a companion;
but not more than one. they must not attract attention. who would be best?
bigwig? dandelion? hazel rejected them. he needed someone who would do as
he was told and not start having ideas of his own. at once he thought of pipkin.
pipkin would follow him without question and do anything he asked. at this
moment he was probably asleep in the burrow which he shared with bluebell and

awake. he brought him out without disturbing the other two rabbi

else. i've got a secret plan; you mustn't tell the others -- for the time being,
anyway. i particularly want you to come and no one else will do."
     this had exactly the effect that hazel intended. pipkin needed no further
persuasion and they set off together, over the grass track, across the turf beyond
and down the escarpment. they went through the narrow belt of trees and came
into the field where holly had called bigwig in the dark. here hazel paused,
sniffing and listening. it was the time before dawn when owls return, usually
hunting as they go. although a full-grown rabbit is not really in danger from owls,
there are few who take no account of them. stoats and foxes might be abroad
also, but the night was still and damp and hazel, secure in his mood of gay
confidence, felt sure that he would either smell or hear any hunter on four feet.
     wherever the farm might be, it must lie beyond the road that ran a

them out, to come and join us here."
     "what for?"
     "well, two of them are does, that's what for."
     "but if holly's successful we shall soon have plenty of does: and from all i've
ever heard of hutch rabbits, they don't take easily to wild life. the truth is, you're
just a silly show-off."
     "a silly show-off?" said hazel. "well, we'll just see whether bigwig and
blackberry think so."
     "risking your life and other rabbits' lives for something that's of little or no
value to us," said fiver. "oh, yes, of course the others will go with you. you're
their chief rabbit. you're supposed to decide what's sensible and they trust you.
persuading them will prove nothing, but three or four dead rabbits will prove
you're a fool, when it's too late."
     "oh, be quiet," answered hazel. "i'm going to sleep."
     during silflay next morning, with pipkin for

a respectful chorus, he told the
others about his visit to the farm. as he had expected, bigwig jumped at the idea
of a raid to free the hutch rabbits.
     "it can't go wrong," he said. "it's a splendid idea, hazel! i don't know how you
open a hutch, but blackberry will see to that. what annoys me is to think you ran
from that cat. a good rabbit's a match for a cat, any day. my mother went for one
once and she fairly gave it something to remember, i can tell you: scratched its

of the others!"

rry took a little more convincing, but he, like bigwig and hazel himself,
was secretly disappointed not to have gone on the expedition with holly; and
when the other two pointed out that they were relying on him to tell them how to
get the hutch open, he agreed to come.
     "do we need to take everyone?" he asked. "you say the dog's tied up and i
suppose there can't be more than three cats. too many rabbits will only be a
nuisance in the dark: someone will get lost and we shall have to spend time
looking for him."

pity it's going to be dark -- we could have taken kehaar: he'd have enjoyed it."
     however, their hopes for that night were disappointed, for the rain returned
before dusk, settling in on a northwest wind and carrying up the hill the sweet-
sour smell of flowering privet from cottage hedges below. hazel sat on the bank
until the light ha

tory that left everyone mystified but
fascinated, about a time when frith had to go away on a journey, leaving the
whole world to be covered with rain. but a man built a great floating hutch that
held all the animals and birds until frith returned and let them out.
     "it won't happen tonight, will it, hazel-rah?" asked pipkin, listening to the rain
in the beech leaves outside. "there's no hutch here."
     "kehaar'll fly you up to the moon, hlao-roo," said bluebell, "and you can come
down on bigwig's head like a birch branch in the frost. but there's time to go to
sleep first."
     before fiver slept, however, he talked again to hazel about the raid.
     "i suppose it's no good asking you not to go?" he said.
     "look here," answered hazel, "have you got one of your bad turns about the
farm? if you have, why not say so straight out? then we'd all know where we
were."
     "i've no feelings about the farm one way or the other," said fiver. "but that
doesn't necessarily mean it's all ri

t is."
     fiver said no more and hazel turned his thoughts to the raid and the difficulty
he foresaw of getting the hutch rabbits to go the distance back to the warren.
     the next day was bright and dry, with a fresh wind that cleared up what
remained of the wet. the clouds came racing over the ridge from the south as they
had on the may evening when hazel first climbed the down. but now they were
higher and smaller, settling at last into a mackerel sky like a beach at low tide.
hazel took bigwig and blackberry to the edge of the escarpment, whence they
could look across to nuthanger on its little hill. he described the approach and
went on to explain how the rabbit hutch was to be found. bigwig was in high
spirits. the wind and the prospect of action excited him and he spent some time
with dandelion, hawkbit and speedwell, pretending to be a cat and encouraging
them to attack him as realistically as they could. hazel, whose talk with fiver had
somewhat clouded him, recovered as he watc

ppointed if we don't meet a cat after all this," said dandelion, as
he waited for his turn to run at a fallen beech branch from one side, claw it twice
and dash out again. "i feel a really dangerous animal."
     "you vatch heem, meester dando," said kehaar, who was hunting for snails in
the grass nearby, "meester pigvig, 'e vant you t'ink all vun peeg yoke; make you
prave. cat 'e no yoke. you no see 'im, you no 'ear 'im. den yomp! 'e come."
     "but we're not going there to eat, kehaar," said bigwig. "that makes all the
difference. we shan't stop watching for cats the whole time."
     "why not eat the cat?" said bluebell. "or bring one back here for breeding?
that ought to improve the warren stock no end."
     hazel and bigwig had decided that the raid should be carried out as soon after
dark as the farm was quiet. this meant that they would cover the half mile to the
outlying sheds at sunset, instead of risking the confusion of a night journey over
ground that only hazel knew. they coul

 be plenty of time to tackle
the hutch; whereas if they were to arrive at dawn they would be working against
time before men came on the scene. finally, the hutch rabbits would not be
missed until the following morning.
     "and remember," said hazel, "it'll probably take these rabbits a long time to
get to the down. we shall have to be patient with them. i'd rather do that in
darkness, elil or no elil. we don't want to be messing about in broad daylight."
     "if it comes to the worst," said bigwig, "we can leave the hutch rabbits and bolt.
elil take the hindmost, don't they? i know it's tough, but if there's real trouble we
ought to save our own rabbits first. let's hope that doesn't happen, though."
     when they came to set out, fiver was nowhere to be seen. hazel felt relieved,
for he had been afraid that fiver might say something that would lower their

spirits. but there was nothing worse to contend with than pipkin's
disappointment at being left behind; and this was dispelled whe

il the western
light was quite gone.
     rabbits do not name the stars, but nevertheless hazel was familiar with the
sight of capella rising; and he watched it now until it stood gold and bright in the
dark northeastern horizon to the right of the farm. when it reached a certain
point which he had fixed, beside a bare branch, he roused the others and led them
up the slope toward the elms. near the top he slipped through the hedge and
brought them down into the lane.
     hazel had already told bigwig of his promise to fiver to keep out of danger;
and bigwig, who had changed much since the early days, had no fault to find.
     "if that's what fiver says, you'd better do it, hazel," he said. "anyhow it'll suit
us. you stay outside the farm in a safe place and we'll bring the rabbits out to you:
then you can take over and get us all away." what hazel had not said was that the
idea that he should remain in the lane was his own suggestion, and that fiver had
acquiesced only because he could not
 
 ___________________________
 
 persuade him to give up the idea of the raid
altogether.
     crouching under a fallen branch on the verge of the lane, hazel watched the
others as they followed bigwig down toward the farmyard. they went slowly,
rabbit fashion, hop, step and pause. the night was dark and they were soon out of
sight, though he could hear them moving down the side of the long barn. he
settled down to wait.
     bigwig's hopes of action were fulfilled almost at once. the cat that he met as he
reached the far end of the barn was not hazel's tabby, but another; ginger, black
and white (and therefore a female); one of those slim, trotting, quick-moving,
tail-twitching cats that sit on farm windowsills in the rain or keep watch from the
tops of sacks on sunny afternoons. it came briskly round the corner of the barn,
saw the rabbits and stopped dead.
     without an instant's hesitation bigwig went straight for it

, as though it had
been the beech branch on the down. but quicker even than he dandelion ran
forward, scratched it and leaped clear. as it turned, bigwig threw his full weight
upon it from the other side. the cat closed with him, biting and scratching, and
bigwig rolled over on the ground. the others could hear him swearing like a cat
himself and struggling for a hold. then he sank one back leg into the cat's side
and kicked backward rapidly, several times.
     anyone who is familiar with cats knows that they do not care for a determined
assailant. a dog that tries to make itself pleasant to a cat may very well get
scratched for its pains. but let that same dog rush in to the attack and many a cat
will not wait to meet it. the farm cat was bewildered b

y the speed and fury of

bigwig's charge. it was no weakling and a good ratter, but it had the bad luck to
be up against a dedicated fighter who was spoiling for action. as it scrabbled out
of bigwig's reach, speedwell cuffed it across the face. this was the last blow
struck, for the wounded cat made off across the yard and disappeared under the
fence of the cow byre.
     bigwig was bleeding from three deep, parallel scratches on the inside of one
hind leg. the others gathered round, praising him, but he cut them short, looking
round the dark yard as he tried to get his bearings.
     "come on," he said. "quickly, too, while the dog's still quiet. the shed: the
hutch -- where do we go?"
     it was hawkbit who found the little yard. hazel had been anxious in case the
shed door might be shut; but it stood just ajar and the five of them slipped in one
after the other. in

 the thick gloom they could not make out the hutch, but they
could both smell and hear the rabbits.
     "blackberry," said bigwig quickly, "you come with me and get the hutch open.
you other three, keep watching. if another cat comes, you'll have to take it on
yourselves."
     "fine," said dandelion. "just leave it to us."
     bigwig and blackberry found the straw bale and climbed on the planks. as they
did so, boxwood spoke from the hutch.
     "who's that? hazel-rah, have you come back?"
     "hazel-rah has sent us," answered blackberry. "we've come to let you out. will
you come with us?"
     there was a pause and some movement in the hay and then clover replied,
"yes, let us out."
     blackberry sniffed his way round to the wire door and sat up, nosing over the
frame, the hasp and the staple. it took him some time to r

any good," he said. "i wonder whether
there's some other way?"
     at that moment it happened that boxwood stood on his hind legs and put his
front paws high on the wire. beneath his weight the top of the door was pressed
slightly outward and the upper of the two leather hinges gave slightly where the
outer nail held it to the body of the hutch itself. as boxwood dropped back on all
fours, blackberry saw that the hinge had buckled and risen just clear of the wood.
     "try it now," he said to bigwig.
     bigwig got his teeth to the hinge and pulled. it tore a very little.
     "by frith, that'll do," said blackberry, for all the world like the duke of
wellington at salamanca. "we just need time, that's all."
     the hinge had been well made and did not give way until they had put it to a
great deal more tugging and biting. dandelion grew nervous and twice gave a
false alarm. bigwig, realizing that the sentries were on the jump from watching
and waiting with nothing to do, changed places

with him and sent speedwell up
to take over from blackberry. when at last dandelion and speedwell had pulled
the leather strip off the nail, bigwig came back to the hutch himself. but they did

not seem much nearer to success. whenever one of the rabbits inside stood up
and rested its forepaws on the upper part of the wire, the door pivoted lightly on
the axis of the staple and the lower hinge. but the lower hinge did not tear.
blowing through his whiskers with impatience, bigwig brought blackberry back
from the threshold. "what's to be done?" he said. "we need some magic, like that
lump of wood you shoved into the river."
     blackberry looked at the door as boxwood, inside, pushed it again. the upright
of the frame pressed tight against the lower strip of leather, but it held smooth
and firm, offering no purchase for teeth.
     "push it the other way -- push from this side," he said, "you push, bigwig. tell
that rabbit inside to get down."
     when bigwig stood up 
 
 ___________________________
 
and pushed the top of the door inward, the frame
immediately pivoted much further than before, because there was no sill along
the bottom of the outer side to stop it. the leather hinge twisted and bigwig
nearly lost his balance. if it had not been for the metal staple arresting the
pivoting, he might actually have fallen inside the hutch. startled, he jumped back,
growling.
     "well, you said magic, didn't you?" said blackberry with satisfaction. "do it
again."
     no strip of leather held by only one broad-headed nail at each end can stand
up for long to repeated twisting. soon one of the nailheads was almost out of
sight under the frayed edges.
     "careful now," said blackberry. "if it g

 little while the other two occupants of the hutch, laurel and
haystack, came hesitantly out and looked about them.
     "where is hazel-rah?" asked laurel.
     "not far away," said blackberry. "he's waiting in the lane."
     "what is the lane?"
     "the lane?" said blackberry in surprise. "surely--"
     he stopped as it came over him that these rabbits knew neither lane nor
farmyard. they had not the least idea of their most immediate surroundings. he
was reflecting on what this meant when bigwig spoke.
     "we mustn't wait about now," he said. "follow me, all of you."

     "but where?" said boxwood.
     "well, out of here, of course," said bigwig impatiently. boxwood looked about
him. "i don't know--" he began.
     "well, i do," said bigwig. "just come with us. never mind anything else."
     the hutch rabbits looked at each other in bewilderment. it was plain that they
were afraid of the great, bristling buck, with his strange shock of fur and his smell
of fresh blood. they did n

better than by day. let's all go and have some, shall we?"
     "oh, yes," said clover, "i'd like that. but will it be safe? we're all very much
afraid of the cats, you know. they come and stare at us sometimes through the
wire and it makes us shiver."
     this showed at least the beginnings of sense, thought blackberry.
     "the big rabbit is a match for any cat," he replied. "he nearly killed one on the
way here tonight."
     "and he doesn't want to fight another if he can help it" said bigwig briskly. "so
if you do want to eat grass by moonlight, let's go to where hazel-rah's waiting for
us."
     as bigwig led the way into the yard, he could make out the shape of the cat that
he had beaten, watching from the woodpile. cat-like, it was fascinated by the
rabbits and could not leave them alone, but it evidently had no stomach for
another fight and as they crossed the yard it stayed where it was.
     the pace was frighteningly slow. boxwood and clover seemed to have grasped
that there

 a loss. after a good deal of delay,
during which the cat left the woodpile and began to move stealthily round toward
the side of the shed, blackberry managed to get them out into the farmyard. but
here, finding themselves in an even more open place, they settled into a kind of
static panic, like that which sometimes comes upon inexperienced climbers
exposed on a sheer face. they could not move, but sat blinking and staring about
them in the darkness, taking no notice of blackberry's coaxing or bigwig's orders.
at this moment a second cat -- hazel's tabby -- came round the further end of the
farmhouse and made toward them. as it passed the kennel the labrador woke
and sat up, thrusting out its head and shoulders and looking first to one side and
then the other. it saw the rabbits, ran to the length of its rope and began to bark.
     "come on!" said bigwig. "we can't stay here. up the lane, everybody, and
quickly, too." blackberry, speedwell and hawkbit ran at once, taking boxwood

er with them into the darkness under the barn. dandelion remained
beside haystack, begging her to move and expecting every moment to feel the
cat's claws in his back. bigwig leaped across to him.
     "dandelion," he said in his ear, "get out of it, unless you want to be killed!"
     "but the--" began dandelion.
     "do as i say!" said bigwig. the noise of barking was fearful and he himself was
close to panic. dandelion hesitated a moment longer. then he left haystack and
shot up the lane, with bigwig beside him.
     they found the others gathered round hazel, under the bank. boxwood and
clover were trembling and seemed exhausted. hazel was talking to them
reassuringly, but broke off as bigwig appeared out of the dark. the dog stopped
barking and there was quiet.
     "we're all here," said bigwig. "shall we go, hazel?"
     "but t

here were four hutch rabbits," said hazel. "where are the other two?"
     "in the farmyard," said blackberry. "we couldn't do anything with them: and
then the dog began to bark."
     "yes, i heard it. you mean they're loose?"
     "they'll be a lot looser soon," said bigwig angrily. "the cats are there."
     "why did you leave them, then?"
     "because they wouldn't move. it was bad enough before the dog started."
     "is the dog tied?" asked hazel.
     "yes, it's tied. but do you expect any rabbit to stand his ground a few feet from
an angry dog?"
     "no, of course not," replied hazel. "you've done wonders, bigwig. they were
just telling me, before you came, that you gave one of the cats such a beating that
it was afraid to come back for more. now look, do

you think you and blackberry,
with speedwell here and hawkbit, can get these two rabbits back to the warren?
i'm afraid you may need most of the night. they can't go very fast and you'll have
to be patient with them. dandelion, you come with me, will you?"
     "where, hazel-rah?"
     "to fetch the other two," said hazel. "you're the fastest, so it won't be so
dangerous for you, will it? now, don't hang about, bigwig, there's a good fellow.
i'll see you tomorrow."
     before bigwig could reply he had disappeared under the elms. dandelion
remained where he was, looking at bigwig uncertainly.
     "are you going to do what he says?" asked bigwig.
     "well, are you?" said dandelion.
     it took bigwig no more than a moment to realize that if he said he was not,
complete disorganization would follow. he could not take all the others back into
the farm, and he could not leave them alone. he muttered something about hazel
being too embleer clever by half, cuffed hawkbit off

a sow thistle he was nibbling
and led his five rabbits over the bank into the field. dandelion, left alone, set off
after hazel into the farmyard.
     as he went down the side of the barn, he could hear hazel out in the open, near
the doe haystack. neither of the hutch rabbits had moved from where he and
bigwig had left them. the dog had returned to its kennel; but although it was not
to be seen, he felt that it was awake and watchful. he came cautiously out of the

shadow and approached hazel.
     "i'm just having a chat with haystack here," said hazel. "i've been explaining
that we've got a little way to go. do you think you could hop across to laurel and
get him to join us?"
     he spoke almost gaily, but dandelion could see his dilated eyes and the slight
trembling of his front paws. he himself

 was now sensing something peculiar -- a
kind of luminosity -- in the air. there seemed to be a curious vibration
somewhere in the distance. he looked round for the cats and saw that, as he
feared, both were crouching in front of the farmhouse a little way off. their
reluctance to come closer could be attributed to bigwig: but they would not go
away. looking across the yard at them, dandelion felt a sudden clutch of horror.
     "hazel!" he whispered. "the cats! dear frith, why are their eyes glittering
green like that? look!"
     hazel sat up quickly and as he did so dandelion leaped back in real terror, for
hazel's eyes were shining a deep, glowing red in the dark. at that moment the
humming vibration grew louder, quenching the rushing of the night breeze in the
elms. then all four rabbits sat as though trans

off, see? you c'n 'ave a look for 'im tomorrow, if 'e's 'ere."
     the silence returned, but still hazel lay motionless in the whispering chill of
the tunnel. a cold lassitude came over him and he passed into a dreaming, inert
stupor, full of cramp and pain. after a time, a thread of blood began to trickle
over the lip of the drain into the trampled, deserted ditch.

          -<*>-

     bigwig, crouched close to blackberry in the straw of the cattle shed, leaped to
flight at the sound of the shot two hundred yards up the lane. he checked himself
and turned to the others.
     "don't run!" he said quickly. "where do you want to run to, anyway? no holes
here."
     "further away from the gun," replied blackberry, white-eyed.
     "wait!" said bigwig, listening. "they're running down the lane. can't you hear
them?"
     "i can hear only two rabbits," answered blackberry, after a pause,

"and one of
them sounds exhausted."
     they looked at each other and waited. then bigwig got up again.
     "stay here, all of you," he said. "i'll go and bring them in."
     out on the verge he found dandelion urging haystack, who was lamed and
spent.
     "come in here quickly," said bigwig. "for frith's sake, where's hazel?"
     "the men have shot him," replied dandelion.
     they reached the other five rabbits in the straw. dandelion did not wait for
their questions.
     "they've shot hazel," he said. "they'd caught that laurel and put him back in
the hutch. then they came after us. the three of us were at the end of a blocked
ditch. hazel went out of his own accord, to distract their attention while we got
away. but we didn't know they had a gun."
     "are you sure they kil

led him?" said speedwell.
     "i didn't actually see him hit, but they were very close to him."
     "we'd better wait," said bigwig.
     they waited a long time. at last dandelion and bigwig went cautiously back up

the lane. they found the bottom of the ditch trampled by boots and streaked with
blood, and returned to tell the others.
     the journey back, with the three limping hutch rabbits, lasted more than two
weary hours. all were dejected and wretched. when at last they reached the foot
of the down bigwig told blackberry, speedwell and hawkbit to leave them and go
on to the warren. they approached the wood just at first light and a rabbit ran to
meet them through the wet gr

 said fiver, very low, "there was a
fourth rabbit behind you, limping and covered with blood. i ran to see who it was,
and then there were only three of you, side by side."
     he paused and looked across the down, as though still seeking the bleeding
rabbit who had vanished in the half-light. then, as blackberry said nothing more,
he asked, "do you know what happened?"
     when blackberry had told his news, fiver returned to the warren and went
underground to his empty burrow. a little later bigwig brought the hutch rabbits
up the hill and at once called everyone to meet in the honeycomb. fiver did not
appear.
     it was a dismal welcome for the strangers. not even bluebell could find a
cheerful word. dandelion was inconsolable to think that he might have stopped
hazel breaking from the ditch. the meeting came to an end in a dreary silence
and a half-hearted silflay.
     later that morning holly came limping into the warren. of his three
companions, only silver was alert and unharmed. b

     "blackberry," said fiver, "do you know the place where hazel was shot?"
     "yes, bigwig and i went and looked at the ditch before we came away. but you

     "could you go there with me now?"
     "go back there? oh, no. it's a long way, fiver, and what would be the good?
the risk, and this fearful heat, and you'd only make yourself wretched."
     "hazel isn't dead," said fiver.
     "yes, the men took him away. fiver, i saw the blood."
     "yes, but you didn't see hazel, because he isn't dead. blackberry, you must do

     "you're asking too much."

hen i shall have to go alone. but what i'm asking you to do is to come and
save hazel's life."
     when at last blackberry had reluctantly given in and they had set out down the
hill, fiver went almost as fast as though he were running for cover. again and
again he urged blackberry to make haste. the fields were empty in the glare.
every creature bigger than a bluebottle was sheltering from the heat. when they
reached the outlying sheds beside the lane, blackberry began to explain how he
and bigwig had gone back to search; but fiver cut him short.
     "we have to go up the slope, i know that: but you must show me the ditch."

     the elms were still. there was not the least sound in the leaves. the ditch was
thick with cow parsley, hemlock and long trails of green-flowering bryony.

     blackberry was beside him at once. "what is it, fiver?"
     "hazel's in that hole," said fiver, "and he's alive."

     in the honeycomb, bigwig and holly were waiting to begin the second meeting
since the loss of hazel. as the air began to cool, the rabbits woke and first one and
then another came down the runs that led from the smaller burrows. all were
subdued and doubtful at heart. like the pain of a bad wound, the effect of a deep
shock takes some while to be felt. when a child is told, for the first time in his life,
that a person he has known is dead, although he does not disbelieve it, he may
well fail to comprehend it and later

make themselves at home in strange conditions and a place where everyone was
lost so poorly in his thoughts? they would die, perhaps, or wander away. he

buckled once more to the task of explaining that he was sure better times lay
ahead -- and as he did so, felt himself the least convinced of any.
     bigwig had sent acorn to see whether there was anyone still to come. acorn
returned to say that strawberry felt too ill and that he could find neither
blackberry nor fiver.
     "well, leave fiver," said bigwig. "poor fellow, he'll feel better by himself for a
time, i dare say."
     "he's not in his burrow, though," said acorn.
     "never mind," said bigwig. but the thought came to him, "fiver and
blackberry? could they have left the warren without telling anyone? if they have,

have to talk about what's best to be done. but i thought that first of all i ought to

back without any does. you don't have to remind me that when we set out,
everyone thought it was going to be straightforward. and here we are, one rabbit
sick, one wounded and nothing to show for it. you're all wondering why."
     "no one's blaming you, holly," said bigwig.
     "i don't know whether i'm to blame or not," replied holly. "but you'll tell me
that when you've heard the story.
     "that morning when we left, it was good weather for hlessil on the move and
we all felt there was no hurry. it was cool, i remember, and looked as if it would

away from the other end of this wood, and although there were no men about so

     "'no,' i said, 'we don't. we want to know where it is.'

number can be above ground at one time. every rabbit is marked when he's a
kitten: they bite them, deep, and under the chin or in a haunch or forepaw. then
they can be told by the scar for the rest of their lives. you mustn't be found above

     "who's to stop you?" growled bigwig.
     "that's the really frightening part. the owsla -- well, you can't imagine it

     "you're not too tired to silflay, are you?" asked dandelion. "and at the proper
time of day, for a change? it's a lovely evening, if my nose says right. we ought to
try not to be more miserable than we can help, you know."
     "just before we silflay," said bigwig, "can i tell you, holly, that i don't believe
anyone else could have brought himself and three other rabbits safely back out of
a place like that?"
     "frith meant us to get back," replied holly. "that's the real reason why we're
here."
     as he turned to follow speedwell up the run that led into the wood, he found
clover beside him. "you and your friends must find it strange to go outside and
eat grass," he said. "you'll get used to it, you know. and i can promise you that

with me and i'll show you a patch of nice, short tail-grass, if bigwig hasn't had it
all while i've been away."
     holly had taken to clover. she seemed more robust and less timid than
boxwood and haystack and was evidently doing her best to adapt herself to
warren life. what her stock might be he could not tell, but she looked healthy.
     "i like it underground all right," said clover, as they came up into the fresh air.
"the closed space is really very much like a hutch, except that it's darker. the
difficult thing for us is going to be feeding in the open.

we're not used to being
free to go where we like and we don't know what to do. you all act so quickly and
half the time i don't know why. i'd prefer not to feed very far from the hole, if you
don't mind."
     they moved slowly across the sunset grass, nibbling as they went: clover was
soon absorbed in feeding, but holly stopped continually to sit up and sniff about
him at the peaceful, empty down. when he noticed bigwig, a little way off, staring
fixedly to the north, he at once followed his gaze.

     "what is it?" he asked.
     "it's blackberry," replied bigwig. he sounded relieved.
     blackberry came hopping rather slowly down from the skyline. he looked tired
out, but as soon as he saw the other rabbits he came on faster and made his way
to bigwig.
     "where have you been?" asked bigwig. "and where's fiver? wasn't he with
you?"
     "fiver's with hazel," said blackberry. "hazel's alive. he's been wo

unded -- it's
hard to tell how badly -- but he won't die."
     the other three rabbits looked at him speechlessly. blackberry waited,
enjoying the effect.
     "hazel's alive?" said bigwig. "are you sure?"
     "quite sure," said blackberry. "he's at the foot of the hill at this very moment,
in that ditch where you were the night holly and bluebell arrived."
     "i can hardly believe it," said holly. "if it's true, it's the best news i've ever
heard in my life. blackberry, you really are sure? what happened? tell us."
     "fiver found him," said blackberry. "fiver took me with him, nearly all the way
back to the farm: then he went along the ditch and found hazel gone to ground

all on the jump, but fiver was like a butterfly on a
stone. he sat in the grass and combed his ears. 'don't get upset,' he kept saying.
'there's nothing to worry about. we can take our time.' after what i'd seen, i'd
have believed him if he'd said we could hunt foxes. but when we got to the bottom
of the hill hazel was completely finished and he couldn't go any further. he and
fiver have taken shelter in the overgrown ditch and i came on to tell you. and
here i am."
     there was silence while bigwig and holly took in the news. at last bigwig said,
"will they stay there tonight?"
     "i think so," replied blackberry. "i'm sure hazel won't be able to manage the
hill until he's a good deal stronger."
     "i'll go down there," said bigwig. "i can help to make the ditch a bit more
comfortable, and probably fiver will be able to do with someone else to help to
look after hazel"
     "i should hurry, then, if i were you," said blackberry. "the sun will be down
soon."
     "hah!" said bigwig, "i

ble down the slope to the road. his sight was swimming and he had to stop
again and again. without fiver's encouragement he would have lain down once
more and given up. in the road, he could not climb the bank and had to limp
along the verge until he could crawl under a gate. much later, as they came under
the pylon line, he remembered the overgrown ditch at the foot of the hill and set
himself to reach it. once there, he lay down and at once returned to the sleep of
total exhaustion.
     when bigwig arrived, just before dark, he found fiver snatching a quick feed
in the long grass. it was out of the question to disturb hazel by digging, and they
spent the night crouched beside him on the narrow floor.
     coming out in the gray light before dawn, the first creature bigwig saw was
kehaar, foraging between the elders. he stamped to attract his attention and
kehaar sailed across to him with one beat of his wings and a long glide.
     "meester pigvig, you find meester 'azel?"
     "yes," sai

d bigwig, "he's in the ditch here."
     "'e not dead?"
     "no, but he's wounded and very weak. the farm man shot him with a gun, you
know."
     "you get black stones out?"
     "how do you mean?"
     "alvays vid gun ees coming liddle black stones. you never see?"
     "no, i don't know about guns."
     "take out black stones, 'e get better. 'e come now, ya?"
     "i'll see," said bigwig. he went down to hazel and found him awake and
talking to fiver. when bigwig told him that kehaar was outside he dragged
himself up the short run and into the grass.
     "dis damn gun," said kehaar. "'e put liddle stones for 'urt you. i look, ya?"
     "i suppose you'd better," said hazel. "my leg's still very bad, i'm afraid."
     he lay down and kehaar's head flicked from side to side as though he were
looking for snails in hazel's brown fur. he peered closely up the length of the torn
flank.
     "ees not stones 'ere," he said. "go in, go out -- no stop. now i see

maybe 'urt you, not long."

     two shotgun pellets were buried in the muscle of the haunch. kehaar detected
them by smell and removed them exactly as he might have picked spiders out of a
crack. hazel had barely time to flinch before bigwig was sniffing at the pellets in
the grass.
     "now ees more bleed," said kehaar. "you stay, vait maybe vun, two day. den
goot like before. dose rabbits up dere, all vait, vait for meester 'azel. i tell dem 'e
come." he flew off before they could reply.
     as things turned out, hazel stayed three days at the foot of the hill. the hot
weather continued and for much of the time he sat under the elder branches,
dozing above ground like some solitary hlessi and feeling his strength returning.

     "i can see how to do the first thing," said blackberry. "at least, i think i can.
but it's dangerous. the other two i can't see at all yet and i'd like to talk it over
with fiver."
     "the sooner fiver and i get back to the warren the better," said hazel. "my
leg's good enough now, but all the same i think we'll leave it for tonight. good old
holly, will you tell them that fiver and i will come early tomorrow morning? it
worries me to think that bigwig and silver may start fighting about clover at any
moment."
     "hazel," said holly, "listen. i don't like this idea of yours at all. i've been in
efrafa and you haven't. you're making a bad mistake and you might very well get
us all killed."
     it was fiver who replied. "it ought to feel like that, i know," he said, "but
somehow it doesn't: not to me. i believe we can do it. anyway, i'm sure hazel's
right when he says it's the only chance we've got. suppose we go on talking about

as we are if they could only live naturally, like us. several would be glad to leave
the place if they only could."
     before they went underground hazel talked to almost all the rabbits. as he
expected, they were disappointed over the failure at efrafa and full of indignation
at the ill-treatment of holly and his companions. more than one thought, like

holly, that the two does were likely to give rise to trouble.
     "there should have been more, hazel," said bigwig. "we shall all be at each
other's throats, you know -- i don't see how it's to be helped."
     late in the afternoon hazel called everyone into the honeycomb.
     "i've been thinking things over," he said. "i know you must all have been really
disappointed not to have got rid of me at nuthanger farm the other day, so i've
decided to go a bit further next time."
     "where?" asked bluebell.
     "to efrafa," replied hazel, "if i can get anyone to come with me: and we shall
bring back as many

 there are plenty in efrafa that you're afraid to go
and get, even though they'd be only too glad to come and join us?"
     someone called out, "what does fiver think?"

     "i'm certainly going," said fiver quietly. "hazel's perfectly right and there's
nothing the matter with his plan. but i promise you this, all of you. if i do come,
later on, to feel any kind of misgiving, i shan't keep it to myself."
     "and if that happens, i shan't ignore it," said hazel.
     there was silence. then bigwig spoke.
     "you may as well all know that i'm going," he said, "and we shall have kehaar
with us, if that appeals to you at all."
     there was a buzz of surprise.
     "of course, there are some of us who ought to stay here," said hazel. "the farm
rabbits can't be expected to go; and i'm not asking anyone who went the first time
to go back again."
     "i'll come, though," said silver. "i hate general woundwort and his council
with all my guts and if we're really going to make fools of them

al woundwort's going to look remarkably silly before we've

     "come where the grass is greener," said bluebell,
     "and the lettuces grow in rows,
     "and a rabbit of free demeanor
     "is known by his well-scratched nose.
     "i think i shall have to come, just to satisfy my curiosity. i've been opening and
shutting my mouth like a baby bird to know about this plan and no one puts
anything in. i suppose bigwig's going to dress up as a hrududu and drive all the
does across the field."
     hazel turned on him sharply. bluebell sat up on his hind legs and said, "please,
general woundwort, sir, i'm only a little hrududu and i've left all my petrol on
the grass, so if you wouldn't mind eating the grass, sir, while i just give this lady a
ride--"
     "bluebell," said hazel, "shut up!"

eaten kipper. hazel sat choking with nausea and disgust as kehaar lifted it entire
and beat it against a beech root, so that small fragments flew round them. he
collected himself and made an effort.
     "kehaar," he said, "bigwig says you told him you'd come and help us to get the

     bigwig came up the run, put his head out of the hole and stopped in horror.

it die under a stone?"

it that they are afraid to do
so; unless (like buckthorn or strawberry on this occasion) they know that they
are not fit and that their bodies may let them down in the pinch. again, in
speaking about his secret plan, hazel had aroused their curiosity. he had hoped
that, with fiver behind him, he could lure them with hints and promises: and he
had been right. the rabbits trusted him and fiver, who had gotten them out of
sandleford before it was too late, crossed the enborne and the common, taken
bigwig out of the wire, founded the warren on the downs, made an ally of kehaar
and produced two does against all odds. there was no telling what they would do
next. but they were evidently up to something; and since bigwig and blackberry
seemed to be confidently in on it, no one was ready to say that he would rather
stay out; especially since hazel had made it clear that anyone who wished could
remain at home and welcome -- implying that if he was so poor-spirited as to
choose to miss the exploit, th

n. they had heard enough about efrafa to
daunt the stoutest heart. but before reaching it -- or wherever they were going --
they had to expect two days on the open down. foxes, stoats, weasels -- any of
these might be encountered, and the only recourse would be flight above ground.
their progress was straggling and broken, slower than that which holly had made
with his picked band of three. rabbits strayed, took alarm, stopped to rest. after a
time hazel divided them into groups, led by silver, bigwig and himself. yet still
they moved slowly, like climbers on a rock face, first some and then others taking
their turn to cross the same piece of ground.
     but at least the cover was good. june was moving toward july and high
summer. hedgerows and verges were at their rankest and thickest. the rabbits
sheltered in dim green sun-flecked caves of grass, flowering marjoram and cow
parsley; peered round spotted hairy-stemmed clumps of viper's bugloss,
blooming red and blue above their heads; pushe

     "i can't see anything wrong with it," he said at last. "can you, fiver?"
     "no," replied fiver. "holly thought it was a strange kind of wood and so it is,
but there don't seem to be any men there. all the same, someone ought to go and
make sure, i suppose. shall i?"
     the third group had come up while hazel had been gazing at the belt, and now
all the rabbits were either nibbling quietly or resting, with ears laid flat, in the
light green sun-and-shade of the thorn thicket
     "is bigwig there?" asked hazel.
     throughout the morning bigwig had seemed unlike himself -- silent and
preoccupied, with little attention for what was going on around him. if his
courage had not been beyond question, it might have been thought that he was
feeling nervous. during one long halt bluebell had overheard him talking with
hazel, fiver and blackberry, and later had told pipkin that it sounded for all the
world as though bigwig were being reassured. "fighting, yes, anywhere," he had
heard him

say, "but i still reckon that this game is more in someone else's line
than mine." "no," replied hazel, "you're the only one that can do it: and
remember, this isn't sport, if the farm raid was. everything depends on it." then,
realizing that bluebell could hear him, he added, "anyway, keep on thinking

about it and try to get used to the idea. we must get on now." bigwig had gone
moodily down the hedgerow to collect his group.
     now he came out of a nearby clump of mugwort and flowering thistle and
joined hazel under the thorn.
     "what do you want?" he asked abruptly.
     "king of cats" (pfeffa-rah), answered hazel, "would you like to go and have a
look in those trees? and if you find any cats or men or anything like that, just
chase them off, would you, and then come and tell us it's all right?"
     when bigwig had slipped away, hazel said to silver, "

     "we're not going to efrafa, though," said hazel. "we're going to find
somewhere to hide, as near to it as we can safely get. any ideas?"
     "only that it's terribly dangerous, hazel-rah," said silver. "you can't get near
efrafa safely and i don't know how you can begin to look for somewhere to hide.
and then the patrol -- if there is one -- they'll be cunning brutes. they might very
well spot us and not show themselves at all -- simply go and report."
     "well, here comes bigwig back again," said hazel. "is it all right, bigwig? good
-- let's get them into the wood and go down the length of it a little way. then we
must slip out on the other side and make sure that kehaar finds us. he's coming
to look for us this afternoon and at all costs we mustn't miss him."
     less than half a mile to the west, they came upon a spinney adjoining the
southern edge of caesar's belt. to the west again was a shallow, dry downland

questions about the plan, he began to wonder how he could distract their
thoughts and get them to relax until they were ready to set off again. he
remembered the time, on the first night of his leadership, when they had been
forced to rest in the wood above the enborne. at least it was good to see that no
one was exhausted now: they were as tough a bunch of hlessil as ever raided a
garden. not a blade of grass to choose between them, thought hazel: pipkin and
fiver looked as fresh as silver and bigwig. still, a little entertainment would be all
to the good and raise their spirits. he was just going to speak up when acorn
saved him the trouble.
     "will you tell us a story, dandelion?" he asked.
     "yes! yes!" said several others. "come on! make it a stunner while you're at it!"
     "all right," said dandelion. "how about 'el-ahrairah and the fox in the
water'?"
     "let's have 'the hole in the sky,'" said hawkbit.
     "no, not that," said bigwig suddenly. he had spoken very little all

and everyone looked round. "if you're going to tell a story, there's only one i
want," he went on. "'el-ahrairah and the black rabbit of inlé.'"
     "perhaps not that one," said hazel.
     bigwig rounded on him, snarling. "if there's going to be a story, don't you think
i've got as good a right as anyone to choose it?" he asked.
     hazel did not reply and after a pause, during which no one else spoke,
dandelion, with a rather subdued manner, began.

ich was more than could be said
for any other rabbit in the audience: but pipkin was hardly to realize this. "let's
go out there for a bit and watch the spiders catching moths, shall we?" said fiver.
"i think i can remember where i left a patch of vetch -- it must be somewhere this
way." still talking quietly, he led pipkin out into the overgrown combe. hazel
turned to make sure of the direction they had taken and as he did so dandelion
hesitated, uncertain whether to resume.
     "go on," said bigwig, "and don't leave anything out."

     "i think many things are left out, if only the truth could be known," said
dandelion, "for no one can say what happens in that country where el-ahrairah
went of his own accord and we do not. but, as i was told, when they first became
aware of the black rabbit, they fled down the tunnel -- as needs they must, for
there was nowhere else to run. and this they did although they had come on
purpose to encounter him and all depended on their doing so. they did

dog roses shiver. as it passed behind a patch of thistles and disappeared from
view, hazel and fiver returned to the others.
     "come on," said hazel. "if you've never seen a fox, don't bother to go and look
now. just follow me."
     he was about to lead the way up the south side of the combe when suddenly a
rabbit shouldered him roughly aside, pushed past fiver and was gone into the
open. hazel stopped and looked round in amazement.
     "who was that?" he asked.
     "bigwig," answered fiver, staring.
     together they went quickly back to the briars and once more looked into the
combe. bigwig, in full view, was loping warily downhill, straight toward the fox.
they watched him, aghast. he drew near, but still the fox paid no attention.
     "hazel," said silver from behind, "shall i--?"
     "no one is to move," said hazel quickly. "keep still, all of you."
     at about thirty yards' distance the fox saw the approaching rabbit. it paused
for a moment and then con

bigwig turned and began to limp up the north slope of the combe toward the trees
of the belt. the fox hesitated again and then followed him.
     "what's he up to?" muttered blackberry.
     "trying to draw it off, i suppose," replied fiver.
     "but he didn't have to! we should have got away without that."
     "confounded fool!" said hazel. "i don't know when i've been so angry."
     the fox had quickened its pace and was now some distance away from them. it
appeared to be overtaking bigwig. the s

un had set and in the failing light they
could just make him out as he entered the undergrowth. he disappeared and the

fox followed. for several moments all was quiet. then, horribly clear across the
darkening, empty combe, there came the agonizing squeal of a stricken rabbit.
     "o frith and inlé!" cried blackberry, stamping. pipkin turned to bolt. hazel did
not move.
     "shall we go, hazel?" asked silver. "we can't help him now."
     as he spoke, bigwig suddenly broke out of the trees, running very fast. almost
before they could grasp that he was alive, he had recrossed the entire upper slope
of the combe in a single dash and bolted in among them.
     "come on," said bigwig, "let's get out of here!"
     "but what -- what -- are you wounded?" asked bluebell in bewilderment.
     "no," said bigwig, "never better! let's go!"
     "you can wait until i'm ready," said hazel in a cold, angry tone. "you've done
your best to kill yourself and acted

like a complete fool. now hold your tongue
and sit down!" he turned and, although it was rapidly becoming too dark to see
any distance, made as though he were still looking out across the combe. behind
him, the rabbits fidgeted nervously. several had begun to feel a dreamlike sense
of unreality. the long day above ground, the close, overgrown combe, the
frightening story in which they had been absorbed, the sudden appearance of the
fox, the shock of bigwig's inexplicable adventure -- all these, following one upon
another, had flooded their spirits and left them dull and bemused.
     "get them out, hazel," whispered fiver, "before they all go tharn."
     hazel turned at once. "well, no fox," he said cheerfully. "it's gone and we'll go,
too. for goodness' sake keep close together, because if anyone gets lost in the
dark we may not find him again. and remember, if we come upon any strange
rabbits, you're to attack them at once and ask questions af

not by hedges but by broad, low banks, each as wide as a lane and overgrown with
elder, dogwood and spindle. it was true rabbit country, reassuring after the belt
and the tangled, goose-grassed combe; and when they had covered a good
distance over the turf -- halting continually to listen and sniff and running, now
one and now another, from each piece of cover to the next -- hazel felt safe in
giving them a rest. as soon as he had sent out speedwell and hawkbit as sentries,
he led bigwig to one side.
     "i'm angry with you," he said. "you're the one rabbit we're not going to be able
to do without and you have to go and run a silly risk like that. it wasn't necessary
and it wasn't even clever. what were you up to?"
     "i'm afraid i just lost my head, hazel," replied bigwig. "i've been strung up all
day, thinking about this business at efrafa -- got me really on edge. when i feel
like that i have to do something -- you know, fight or run a risk. i thought if i

     "playing el-ahrairah," said hazel. "you duffer, you might have thrown your life
away for nothing -- we all thought you had. don't try it again, there's a good chap.

you know everything's going to depend on you. but tell me, whatever happened
in the trees? why did you cry like that, if you were all right?"
     "i didn't," said bigwig. "it was very queer, what happened, and bad, too, i'm
afraid. i was going to lose the homba in the trees, you see, and then come back.
well, i went into the undergrowth, and i'd just stopped limping and was starting
to run really fast when suddenly i found myself face to face with a bunch of
rabbits -- strangers. they were coming toward me, as if they were going out into
the open combe. of course, i didn't have time to get a good look at them, but they
seemed to be big fellows. 'look out -- run

went even faster then and i got clear of the trees and came back to you."
     "so the homba got this other rabbit?"
     "it must have. after all, i led it right onto them, even though i didn't mean to.
but i never saw what actually happened."
     "what became of the others?"
     "i've no idea. they must have run, i suppose."
     "i see," said hazel thoughtfully. "well, perhaps it's all for the best. but look
here, bigwig, no more fancy tricks until the proper time -- there's too much at
stake. you'd better stay near silver and me -- we'll keep you in good heart."
     at that moment silver came up to them.
     "hazel," he said, "i've just realized where we are and it's a lot too close to
efrafa. i think we ought to make off as soon as we can."
     "i want to go right round efrafa -- wide," said hazel. "do you think you can
find the way to that iron road holly told us about?"
     "i think so," replied silver.

ney over the downs had evidently proved too much for the muscle torn
by the shotgun pellets. he wondered whether it was far to the river of which
kehaar had spoken. if it was, he was in for trouble.
     "hazel-rah," said pipkin, coming up from among the soapwort, "are you all
right? your leg looks queer -- you're dragging it."
     "no, it's all right," said hazel. "look, hlao-roo, where's kehaar? i want to talk
to him."
     "he's flown out to see if there's a patrol anywhere near, hazel-rah. bigwig
woke some time ago and he and silver asked kehaar to go. they didn't want to
disturb you."
     hazel felt irritated. it would have been better to be told at once which way to

go, rather than to wait while kehaar looked for patrols. they were going to cross a
river and, as far as he was concerned, they could not do it too soon. fretting, he
waited for kehaar. soon he had become as tense and nervous as he had ever been
in his life. he was beginning to believe that after all he might have been

was clear that holly had not underrated their danger near efrafa. he had little
doubt that bigwig, by sheer chance, had led the fox onto a wide patrol which had
been following their trail. then, in the morning, again by luck and the help of
kehaar, they had evidently just missed another at the crossing of the iron road.
perhaps silver's fear was well founded and a patrol had already spotted and
reported them without their knowing? had general woundwort got some sort of
kehaar of his own? perhaps a bat was at this moment talking to him? how was
one to foresee and guard against everything? th

now, with bigwig: he could understand his feelings. waiting was bad. he fidgeted
for some kind of action. just as he had decided to wait no longer, but to collect
everyone and go immediately, kehaar came flying from the direction of the
cutting. he flapped clumsily down among the firs, silencing the bats.

path, hazel was combing the goose grass out of his coat and evidently listening to
fiver as they sat together under a rhododendron. pipkin ran along the bank and
joined them.
     "there's nothing wrong with the place," fiver was saying. "there's no more
danger here than anywhere else. kehaar's going to show us where to get across,
isn't he? the thing to do is to get on with it before it gets dark."
     "they'll never stop here," replied hazel. "we can't stay and wait for bigwig in a
place like this. it's unnatural for rabbits."
     "yes, we can -- calm down. they'll get used to it quicker than you think. i tell
you, it's better than one or two other places we've been in. not all strange things
are bad. would you like me to take them over? say it's because of your leg."
     "fine," said hazel. "hlao-roo, can you get everyone along here?"
     when pipkin had gone, he said, "i feel troubled, fiver. i'm asking so much of
them, and there are so many risks in this plan."

d a grove of great horse chestnuts
extended almost down to the bridge. the ground was marshy, but at least there
was plenty of cover. fiver and pipkin began at once on some scrapes, while hazel
sat chewing pellets and resting his injured leg. soon they were joined by silver
and dandelion, but the other rabbits, more hesitant even than hazel, remained
crouching in the long grass on the right bank. at last, just before darkness fell,
fiver re-crossed the bridge and coaxed them to follow him back. bigwig, to
everyone's surprise, showed considerable reluctance, and only crossed in the end
after kehaar, returning from another flight over efrafa, had asked whether he
would like him to go and fetch a fox.
     the night that followed seemed to all of them disorganized and precarious.
hazel, still conscious of being in man country, was half expecting either a dog or a
cat. but although they heard owls more than once, no elil attacked them and by
the morning they were in better spirits.

     "what is it, kehaar? not a patrol?"
     "na, na. ees all fine for sleep like bloody owls. maybe i go for peeg vater.

     "no, you're right, kehaar, we must start now. the trouble is, i can see how to
start but not how to finish."
     hazel made his way through the grass, roused the first rabbit he found -- who
happened to be bluebell -- and sent him to fetch bigwig, blackberry and fiver.
when they came, he took them to join kehaar on the short grass of the riverbank.
     "this is the problem, blackberry," he said. "you remember that when we were
under the down that evening i said we should have to do three things: get the
does out of efrafa, break up the pursuit and then get right away so that they
wouldn't find us. this plan you've thought up is clever. it'll do the first two things,
all right, i'm sure of that. but what about the last one? the efrafan

up, circled the pool and perched on the hand rail.
     "this is more sheltered and lonely than the bridge we crossed last night," said
blackberry. "perhaps we could make some use of it. you didn't know about this
bridge, kehaar, did you?"
     "na, not know, not see heem. but ees goot pridge -- no von come."

     "i'd like to go across, hazel-rah," said blackberry.
     "well, fiver's the rabbit for that," replied hazel. "he simply loves crossing
bridges. you carry on. i'll come behind, with bigwig and bluebell here."
     the five rabbits hopped slowly along the planks, their great, sensitive ears full
of the sound of the falling water. hazel, who was not sure of his footing, had to
stop several times. when at length he reached the further side, he found that
fiver and blackberry had already gone a little way downstream below the fall and
were looking at some large object sticking out from the bank. at first he thought
that it must be a fallen tree trunk, but as he came closer he saw tha

 stone-colored, black-spotted trout swim up
into the fall. the "boat" was a miniature punt, used for reed-cutting -- little more
than a raft, with a single thwart amidships. even when it was unmanned, as now,
there were only a few inches of freeboard.
     "you know," said fiver from the bank, "seeing you sitting there reminds me of
that other wooden thing you found when the dog was in the wood and you got
pipkin and me over the river. do you remember?"
     "i remember shoving you along," said bigwig. "it was jolly cold."
     "what puzzles me," said blackberry, "is why this boat thing doesn't go along.
everything in this river goes along, and fast, too -- see there." he looked out at a
piece of stick floating down on the even two-mile-an-hour current. "so what's
stopping this thing from going?"
     kehaar had a short-way-with-landlubbers manner which he sometimes used to
those of the rabbits that he did not particularly like. blackberry was not one of his

favorites: he preferred straigh

     "ees rope. you like bite heem, den you go damn queek, all de vay."
     "yes, i see," said fiver. "the rope goes round that metal thing where hazel's
sitting: and the other end's fixed on the bank here. it's like the stalk of a big leaf.
you could gnaw it through and the leaf -- the boat -- would drop off the bank."
     "well, anyway, let's go back now," said hazel, rather dejectedly. "i'm afraid we
don't seem to be any nearer to finding what we're looking for, keha

ar. can you
possibly wait until tomorrow? i had the idea that we might all move to
somewhere a bit drier before tonight -- higher up in the wood, away from the
river."
     "oh, what a pity!" said bluebell. "do you know, i'd quite decided to become a
water rabbit."
     "a what?" asked bigwig.
     "a water rabbit," repeated bluebell. "well, there are water rats and water
beetles and pipkin says that last night he saw a water hawk. so why not a water
rabbit? i shall float merrily along--"
     "great golden frith on a hill!" cried blackberry suddenly. "great jumping
rabscuttle! that's it! that's it! bluebell, you shall be a water rabbit!" he began
leaping and skipping about on the bank and cuffing fiver with his front paws.
"don't you see, fiver? don't you see? we bite the rope and

     fiver paused. "yes, i do see," he replied at length. "you mean on the boat. i
must say, blackberry, you're a clever fellow. i remember now that after we'd
crossed that other river you said that that floating trick might come in handy
again sometime."
     "here, wait a moment," said hazel. "we're just simple rabbits, bigwig and i.
do you mind explaining?"
     then and there, while the black gnats settled on their ears, by the plank bridge
and the pouring waterfall, blackberry and fiver explained.
     "could you just go and try the rope, hazel-rah?" added blackberry, when he
had finished. "it may be too thick."
     they went back to the punt.
     "no, it's not," said hazel, "and it's stretched tight, of course, which makes it
much easier to gnaw. i can gnaw that, all right."
     "ya, ees goot," said kehaar. "y

     "there's nothing more to wait for," said hazel. "go on, bigwig, straightaway,
and may el-ahrairah go with you. and remember, you're the leader now. send
word by kehaar what you want us to do; we shall all be here, ready to back you
up."
     afterward, they all remembered how bigwig had taken his orders. no one
could say that he did not practice what he preached. he hesitated a few moments
and then looked squarely at hazel.
     "it's sudden," he said. "i wasn't expecting it tonight. but that's all to the good --
i hated waiting. see you later."
     he touched his nose to hazel's, turned and hopped away into the undergrowth.

a few minutes later, guided by kehaar, he was running up the open pasture north
of the river, straight for the brick arch in the overgrown railway

 of course, to say when they're going
down, and he reports on the weather, but i always go and have a look for myself
as well. in moonlight we put the sentries fairly close in and keep on the move
ourselves to make sure no one goes too far. but in rain or darkness we send the
mark up in small groups, one after the other, and each group has a sentry in
charge. in absolutely desperate weather we ask the general's permission to
postpone the silflay."
     "but do they often try to run away?" asked bigwig. during the afternoon he
had been up and down the runs and crowded burrows with chervil and avens,
the other mark officer, and had thought to himself that never in his life had he
seen such a cheerless, dispirited lot of rabbits. "they don't strike me as a very
difficult bunch."
     "most of them are no trouble, it's true," said avens, "but you never know when
trouble's coming. for instance, you'd have said there wasn't a more docile lot in
efrafa than the right flank. and then one day they ge

ditch every day, as a punishment. you can nearly always find someone to punish
if you try hard enough. today's squad fills up yesterday's trough and digs another.
there are special runs leading into the bottom of the ditch and the mark have got
to use those and no others when they go out to pass hraka. we keep a hraka
sentry in the ditch to make sure they come back."
     "how do you check them in after silflay?" asked bigwig.
     "well, we know them all by sight," replied chervil, "and we watch them go
down. there are only two entrance holes for the mark and one of us sits at each
hole. every rabbit knows which hole he has to use and i should certainly miss any
of mine who didn't go down. the sentries come in last of all -- i only call them in
when i'm quite sure that all the mark are down. and once they're down, of
course, they can't very well get out, with a sentry at each hole. digging i should

the only really dangerous time is when there's an alarm -- say, a man or a fox.
then we all bolt for the nearest hole, of course. so far, it doesn't seem to have
occurred to anyone that he could bolt the other way and have quite a long start
before he was missed. still, no rabbit will bolt toward elil, and that's the real
safeguard."
     "well, i admire your thoroughness," said bigwig, thinking to himself that his
secret task seemed to be even more hopeless than he had expected. "i'll get the
hang of it all as soon as i can. when do we have the chance of a patrol?"
     "i expect the general will take you on patrol himself, to begin with," said
avens. "he did me. you may not be so keen when you've had a day or two with
him -- you'll be worn out. still, i must admit, thlayli, you're a fine size, and if
you've been living rough for some time you'll probably manage it all right

captain sainfoin i'm bringing my mark up at once."
     turning to one of his own sentries who was close by, chervil told him to go
round the burrows and send everyone up for silflay.
     "now," he said, "avens, you go to the further hole as usual, and thlayli can join
me on the nearer one. we'll send four sentries out to the line, to start with, and
when the mark have all gone out we'll add four more and keep two in reserve. i'll
see you in the usual place, by the big flint in the bank."
     bigwig followed chervil along the run, down which came the scents of warm
grass, clover and hop trefoil. he had found most of the runs closer and stuffier
than he was used to, no doubt because there were so few holes into the open air.
the prospect of an evening silflay, even in efrafa, was pleasant. he thought of the
beech leaves rustling above the far-off honeycomb, and sighed. "i wonder how
old holly's getting on," he thought, "and whether i'll ever see him again: or hazel
either, for the matter of
 
 ___________________________
 
 that. well, i'll give these blighters something to think
about before i've finished. i do feel lonely, though. how hard it is to carry a secret
by yourself!"
     they reached the mouth of the hole and chervil went outside to look round.
when he returned, he took up station at the top of the run. as bigwig found a
place alongside, he noticed for the first time, in the opposite wall of the run, a
kind of recess like an open cave. in this, three rabbits were squatting. those on
either side had the tough, stolid look of members of the owslafa. but it was at the
one in the middle that he stared. this rabbit had very dark fur -- almost black.
but this was not the most remarkable thing about him. he was dreadfully
mutilated. his ears were nothing but shapeless shreds, ragged at the edges,
seamed with i

ll-knit scars and beaded here and there with lumps of proud, bare
flesh. one eyelid was misshapen and closed askew. despite the cool, exciting air
of the july evening, he seemed apathetic and torpid. he kept his gaze fixed on the
ground and blinked continually. after a time he lowered his head and rubbed his
nose on his forepaws in a listless manner. then he scratched his neck and settled
down in his former drooping position.

     bigwig, his warm, impulsive nature stirred by curiosity and pity, went across
the run.
     "who are you?" he asked.
     "my name is blackavar, sir," replied the rabbit. he did not look up and spoke
without expression, as though he had answered this question many times before.
     "are you going to silflay?" said bigwig. no doubt, he thought, this was some
hero of the warren, wounded in a great fight and now infirm, whose past services
merited an honorable escort when he went out.
     "no, sir," an

swered the rabbit.
     "why ever not?" said bigwig. "it's a lovely evening."
     "i don't silflay at this time, sir."
     "then why are you here?" asked bigwig, with his usual directness.
     "the mark that has the evening silflay, sir," began the rabbit. "the mark that
has -- they come -- i--" he hesitated and fell silent.
     one of the owslafa spoke. "get on with it," he said.
     "i come here for the mark to see me," said the rabbit in his low, drained voice.
"every mark should see how i have been punished as i deserve for my treachery
in trying to leave the warren. the council were merciful -- the council were
merciful -- the council -- i can'
 
 ___________________________
 
t remember it, sir, i really can't," he burst out,
turning to the sentry who had spoken. "i can't seem to remember anything."
     the sentry said nothing. bigwig, after staring in shocked silence for a few
moments, rejoined chervil.
     "he's supposed to tell everybody who asks," said chervil, "but he's getting sort
of stupid after half a month of it. he tried to run away. campion caught him and
brought him back and the council ripped up his ears and said he had to be shown
at every morning and evening silflay, as an example to the others. but if you ask
me, he won't last much longer. he'll meet a blacker rabbit than himself one of
these nights."

bigwig shuddered, partly at chervil's tone of callous indifference and partly at
his own memories. the mark were filing up now and he watched as they went
past, each darkening the entrance for a moment before hopping out under the
hawthorn. it was clear that chervil prided himself on knowing his rabbits by
name. he spoke to most of them and was at pains to show that he had some
knowledge of their personal lives. it seemed to bigwig that the answers he got
were not particularly warm or friendly, but he did not know whether to put that
down to dislike of chervil or merely to the lack of spirit that seemed to be
common to the rank and file in efrafa. he was closely on the watch -- as
blackberry had advised him to be -- for any signs of disaffection or rebellion, but
he could see little grounds for hope in the expressionless faces that went by. at
the end came a little group of three or four does, talking among themselves.

chervil to the first, as she passed him.
     the doe, a pretty, long-nosed rabbit not more than three months old, stopped
and looked at him.
     "you'll get on yourself one day, captain, i dare say," she replied. "like captain
mallow -- he got on, you know. why don't you send some does on wide patrol?"
     she paused for chervil to reply, but he made no answer and did not speak to

the does who followed nelthilta out into the field.
     "what did she mean by that?" asked bigwig.
     "well, there's been trouble, you know," said chervil. "a bunch of does in the
near fore started a row at a council meeting. the general said they must be
broken up and we had a couple sent to us. i've been keeping an eye on them.
they're no trouble themselves, but nelthilta's taken up with them and it seems to
have made her cheeky and resentful: sort of thing you saw just now. i don't really

     "right," said bigwig. "by the way, what are the rules about mating?"
     "mating?" said chervil. "well, if you want a doe, you have one -- any doe in the
mark, that is. we're not officers for nothing, are we? the does are under orders
and none of the bucks can stop you. that just leaves you and me and avens; and
we shall hardly quarrel. there are plenty of does, after all."
     "i see," said bigwig. "well, i'll silflay now. unless you've got any other ideas,
i'll go and talk to some of the mark and then go round

of the land. what about blackavar?"
     "leave him," said chervil. "he's none of our business. the owslafa will keep
him here until the mark come back and after that they'll take him away."
     bigwig made his way into the field, conscious of the wary glances of the rabbits
he passed. he felt perplexed and apprehensive. how was he to begin his
dangerous task? begin he must, in one way or another, for kehaar had made it
clear that he was not ready to wait. there was nothing for it but to take a chance
and trust somebody. but whom? a warren like this must be full of spies. probably
only general woundwort knew who the spies were. was there a spy watching him
now?

open meadow in the
evening sun. after a while he found that he was approaching a small hollow,
much like the one on watership down where he and silver had found kehaar. in
this hollow there were four does, with their backs to him. he recognized them as
the little group who had gone out last. they had evidently finished the hungry,
intent stage of feeding and were browsing and talking at leisure, and he could see
that one of them had the attention of the other three. even more than most
rabbits, bigwig loved a story and now he felt attracted by the prospect of hearing
something new in this strange warren. he moved quietly up to the edge of the
hollow just as the doe began to speak.
     at once he realized that this was no story. yet he had heard the like before,
somewhere. the rapt air, the rhythmic utterance, the intent listeners -- what was
it they recalled? then he remembered the smell of carrots, and silverweed
dominating the crowd in the great burrow. but these verses went to his heart

fence to imprison the wind.
     i shall never feel the wind blowing again.

     the doe was silent and her three companions said nothing: but their stillness
showed plainly enough that she had spoken for all of them. a flock of starlings
passed overhead, chattering and whistling, and a liquid dropping fell into the
grass among the little group, but none moved or startled. each seemed taken up
with the same melancholy thoughts -- thoughts which, however sad, were at least
far from efrafa.
     bigwig's spirit was as tough as his body and quite without sentimentality, but,
like most creatures who have experienced hardship and danger, he could
recognize and respect suffering when he saw it. he was accustomed to sizing up
other rabbits and deciding what they were good for. it struck him that these does
were not far from the end of their powers. a wild animal that feels that it no
longer has any reason to live reaches in the end a point when its remaining
energies may actually be directed towar

d dying. it was this state of mind that
bigwig had mistakenly attributed to fiver in the warren of the snares. since then
his judgment had matured. he felt that despair was not far from these does; and
from all that he had heard of efrafa, both from holly and from chervil, he could
understand why. he knew that the effects of overcrowding and tension in a
warren show themselves first in the does. they become infertile and aggressive.
but if aggression cannot mend their troubles, then often they begin to drift
toward the only other way out. h

e wondered what point on this dismal path these

particular does had reached.
     he hopped down into the hollow. the does, disturbed from their thoughts,
looked at him resentfully and drew back.
     "i know you're nelthilta," said bigwig to the pretty young doe who had retorted
to chervil in the run. "but what's your name?" he went on, turning to the doe
beside her.
     after a pause, she answered reluctantly, "thethuthinnang, sir."*
     "and yours?" said bigwig, to the doe who had spoken the verses.
     she turned to him a look of such wretchedness, so full of accusation and
suffering, that it was all he could do not to beg her then and there to believe that
he was her secret friend and that he hated efrafa and the authority which he
represented. nelthilta's rejoinder to chervil in the run had been full of hatred, but
this doe's gaze spoke of wrongs beyond her power to express. as bigwig stared
back at her, he suddenly recalled holly's description of
 
 ___________________________
 
 the great yellow hrududu
that had torn open the earth above the destroyed warren. "that might have met a
look like this," he thought. then the doe answered, "my name is hyzenthlay, sir."
     "hyzenthlay?" said bigwig, startled out of his self-possession. "then it was you
who--" he stopped. it might be dangerous to ask whether she remembered
speaking to holly. but whether she did or not, here, evidently, was the rabbit who
had told holly and his companions about the troubles of efrafa and the
discontent of the does. if he remembered holly's story rightly, she had already
made some sort of attempt to leave the warren. "but," he thought, as he met once
more her desolate eyes, "what is she good for now?"
     "

may we have permission to go, sir?" asked nelthilta. "the company of officers
absolutely overpowers us, you see: we find a little of it goes an awfully long way."
     "oh -- yes -- certainly -- by all means," replied bigwig in confusion. he
remained where he was as the does hopped away, nelthilta raising her voice to
remark, "what a great oaf!" and half looking round in the evident hope that he
would take her up.
     "oh, well, there's one of them with some spirit left, anyway," he thought, as he
made his way out to the sentries.
     he spent some time talking to the sentries and learning how they were
organized. it was a depressingly efficient system. each sentry could reach his
neighbor in a matter of moments;

pretended to feed his way out as far as he could," said marjoram, "and
then he made a dash. he actually managed to knock down two sentries who tried
to stop him; and i doubt whether anyone on his own has ever done as much as
that. he ran like mad, but campion had got the alarm, you see, and he simply
moved round and intercepted him further down the fields. of course, if he hadn't
smashed up the sentries, the council might have let him off more lightly."
     "do you like the warren life?" asked bigwig.

     "it's not too bad now i'm in the owsla," answered marjoram, "and if i can get
to be an officer it'll be better still. i've done two wide patrols now -- they're the
thing for getting yourself noticed. i can track and fight as well as most, but of
course they want more than that from an officer. i think our officers are a strong
bunch, don't you?"
     "yes, i do," said bigwig with feeling. it struck him that marjoram evidently did
not know that he himself was a newcomer to efrafa. at any

 rate, he showed
neither jealousy nor resentment. bigwig was beginning to realize that in this place
nobody was told more than was good for him, or got to know much except what
was before his nose. marjoram probably supposed that he, bigwig, had been
promoted out of another mark.
     as darkness fell, just before the end of the silflay, captain campion came up
the field with a patrol of three and chervil ran out to meet him on the sentry line.
bigwig joined them and listened to the talk. he gathered that campion had been
out as far as the iron road but had found nothing unusual.
     "don't you ever go beyond the iron road?" he asked.
     "not very often," answered campion. "it's wet, you know -- bad rabbit country.
i have been there, but on these ordinary circuit patrols i'm really looking nearer
home. my job is partly to notice anything new that the council ought to know
about, and partly to make sure we pick up anyone who bolts. like th

fine evening like this, i generally go down as far as the bank of the iron road and
then work along this side of it. or sometimes i go out in the other direction, as far
as the barn. it all depends what's wanted. by the way, i saw the general earlier
this evening and i rather think he means to take you on patrol in two or three
days' time, as soon as you've settled down and your mark have come off the dawn
and evening silflay."
     "why wait for that?" said bigwig with all the enthusiasm he could assume.
"why not sooner?"
     "well, a mark generally keeps a full owsla when it's on dawn and evening
silflay. the rabbits are more lively at those times, you see, and need more
supervision. but a mark that's on ni-frith and fu-inlé silflay can generally spare
owsla for a wide patrol. now i'll leave you here. i've got to take my lot to the
crixa and report to the general."
     as soon as the mark had gone underground and blackavar had been taken
away by his

escort, bigwig excused himself to chervil and avens and went to his
own burrow. although the rank and file were cramped underground, the sentries
had two large, roomy burrows to themselves, while each officer had a private
burrow. by himself at last, bigwig settled down to think over his problem.
     the difficulties were bewildering. he was fairly certain that with kehaar's help
he himself could escape from efrafa whenever he wished. but how in the world
was he to bring a bunch of does out -- supposing that any were ready to try it? if
he took it upon himself to call the sentries in during a silflay, chervil would see in
a matter of moments what he had done. the only possibility, then, was to make
the break-out during the day: to wait until cher
 
 ___________________________
 
vil was asleep and then order a
sentry to leave his post at the mouth of one of the holes. bigwig considered. he
could see no flaw in this idea. then the thought came to him, "and what about

blackavar?" blackavar presumably spent the day under guard in some special
burrow. probably hardly anyone knew where -- no one knew anything in efrafa --
and certainly no one would tell. so he would have to leave blackavar: no realistic
plan could include him.
     "i'll be jiggered if i leave him," muttered bigwig to himself. "i know blackberry
would say i was a fool. still, he's not here and i'm doi

d to him that perhaps he might start his venture from the other end -- by
persuading some of the does to join him and working out a plan afterward,
perhaps with their help. he went down the run until he came upon a young rabbit
sleeping as best he could outside an overcrowded burrow. he woke him.
     "do you know hyzenthlay?" he asked.
     "oh, yes, sir," replied the rabbit, with a rather pathetic attempt to sound brisk
and ready.
     "go and find her and tell her to come to my burrow," said bigwig. "no one else
is to come with her. do you understand?"
     "yes, sir."
     when the youngster had scurried off, bigwig returned to his burrow,
wondering whether there would be any suspicion. it seemed unlikely. from what
chervil had said, it was common enough for efrafan officers to send for does. if
he were questioned he had only to play up. he lay down and waited.
     in the dark, a rabbit came slowly up the run and stopped at the entrance to the
burrow. there was a pause.
     "hyzenthlay
 
 ___________________________
 
?" said bigwig.
     "i am hyzenthlay."
     "i want to talk to you," said bigwig.
     "i am in the mark, sir, and under your orders. but you have made a mistake."
     "no, i haven't," replied bigwig. "you needn't be afraid. come in here, close
beside me."
     hyzenthlay obeyed. he could feel her fast pulse. her body was tense: her eyes
were closed and her claws dug into the floor.
     "hyzenthlay," whispered bigwig in her ear, "listen carefully. you remember
that many days ago now, four rabbits came to efrafa in the evening. one had very
pale gray fur and one had a healed rat bite in his foreleg. you talked with their
leader -- his name was holly. i know what he told you."
     she turned her head in fear. "how do you know?"
     "never mind. only listen to me."
     then bigwig spoke of hazel and fiver; of the destruction of the sandleford
warren and the journey to watership down. hyzenthlay neither move

interrupted.
     "the rabbits who talked to you that evening," said bigwig, "who told you about
the warren that was destroyed and of how they had come to ask for does from
efrafa -- do you know what became of them?"
     hyzenthlay's reply was no more than the faintest murmur in his ear.

     "i know what i heard. they escaped the next evening. captain charlock was
killed pursuing them."
     "and was any other patrol sent after them, hyzenthlay? the next day, i mean?"
     "we heard that there was no officer to spare, with bugloss under arrest and
charlock dead."

    "those rabbits returned to us safely. one of them is not far away now, with our
chief rabbit and several more. they are cunning and resourceful. they are
waiting for me to bring does out of efrafa -- as many as i can get to come. i shall
be able to send them a message tomorrow morning."
     "how?"
     "by a bird -- if all goes well." bigwig told her about kehaar. when he had
finished, hyzenthlay made no reply and he could not tell whether she was
considering all that he had said or whether fear and disbelief had so troubled her
that she did not know what to say. did she think he was a spy trying to trap her?
did she perhaps wish only that he would let her go away? at last he said,
     "do you believe me?"
     "yes, i believe you."
     "might i not be a spy sent by the council?"
     "you are not. i can tell."
     "how?"
     "

you spoke of your friend -- the one who knew that that warren was a bad
place. he is not the only such rabbit. sometimes i can tell these things, too: but
not often now, for my heart is in the frost."
     "then will you join me -- and persuade your friends as well? we need you:
efrafa doesn't need you."
     again she was silent. bigwig could hear a worm moving in the earth nearby
and faintly down the tunnel came the sound of some small creature pattering
through the grass outside. he waited quietly, knowing that it was vital that he
should not upset her.
     at last she spoke again, so low in his ear that the words seemed barely more
than broken cadences of breathing.
     "we can escape from efrafa. the danger is very great, but in that we can
succeed. it is beyond that i cannot see. confusion and fear at nightfall -- and t

become foolish -- tales for kittens on a summer evening. no, i cannot see as i did
once: it is like the shapes of trees beyond a field of rain."
     "well, you'd better come and meet this friend of mine," said bigwig. "he talks
just like that, and i've come to trust him, so i trust you, too. if you feel we're going
to succeed, that's fine. but what i'm asking is whether you'll bring your friends to
join us."
     after another silence, hyzenthlay said, "my courage -- my spirit: it's so much
less than it was. i'm afraid to let you rely on me."
     "i can tell that. what is it that's worn you down? weren't you the leader of the
does who went to the council?"
     "there was myself and thethuthinnang. i don't

or us does once more. the general said that no one else would have the chance
to run away. we were to be split up among the marks, no more than two to each
mark. i don't know why they left thethuthinnang and me together. perhaps they
didn't stop to think. efrafa's like that, you know. the order was 'two to each
mark,' so as long as the order was carried out it didn't particularly matter which
two. now i'm frightened and i feel the council are always watching."
     "yes, but i'm here now," said bigwig.
     "the council are very cunning."
     "they'll need to be. we've got some rabbits who are far more cunning, believe
me. el-ahrairah's owsla, no less. but tell me -- was nelthilta with you when you
went to the council?"
     "oh, no, she was born here, in the near hind. she's got spirit, you know, but
she's young and silly. it excites her to let everyone see that she's a friend of
rabbits who are thought of as rebels. she doesn't realize what she's doing or what
the council are really like.

     "how many does in this mark would be ready to join an escape?"
     "hrair. there's a great deal of discontent, you know. but, thlayli, they mustn't
be told until a very short time before we run -- not just nelthilta, but all of them.
no one can keep a secret in a warren and there are spies everywhere. you and i
must make a plan ourselves and tell no one but thethuthinnang. she and i will
get enough does to come with us when the time comes."
     bigwig realized that he had stumbled, quite unexpectedly, upon what he
needed most of all: a strong, sensible friend who would think on her own account
and help to bear his burden.
     "i'll leave it to you to pick the does," he said. "i can make the chance to run if
you'll have them ready to take it."
     "when?"
     "sunset will be best, and the sooner the better. hazel and the others will meet
us and fight any patrol that follows. but the main thing is that the bird will fight
for us. even wound

wort won't be expecting that."
     hyzenthlay was silent again and bigwig realized with admiration that she was
going over what he had said and searching for flaws.
     "but how many can the bird fight?" she said at last. "can he drive them all
away? this is going to be a big break-out and, make no mistake, thlayli, the
general himself will be after us with the best rabbits he has. we can't go on
running away forever. they won't lose track of us and sooner or later they'll
overtake us."

who tries to follow us. remember, we go straight down to the great arch in the
iron road. my friends will be waiting there. you've only to follow me -- i'll lead the
way."
     "captain campion may be on patrol."
     "oh, i do hope he is," said bigwig. "i really do."
     "blackavar may not run at once. he will be as startled as the guards."
     "is it possible to warn him?"
     "no. his guards never leave him and they take him out to silflay alone."
     "for how long will he have to live like that?"
     "when he has been to every mark in turn, the council will kill him. we all feel
sure of that."
     "then that settles it. i won't go without him."

     "you shall: and tell stories in the honeycomb and silflay whenever you feel like
it. it's a fine life, i promise you."

     "i'll come! i'll run any risk."
     "what a stroke of luck that you should be in this mark," said bigwig. "before
this talk with you tonight, i was at my wits' end, wondering whatever i was going
to do."
     "i'll go back to the lower burrows now, thlayli. some of the other rabbits are
bound to wonder why you sent for me. it's not mating time with me, you see. if i
go now, we can say you made a mistake and were disappointed. don't forget to
say that."

 the
gigantic figure of general woundwort. at last, worn out with his apprehensions,
he passed into a deep sleep where even his fear could not follow, and lay without
sound or movement in the solitary burrow.

     we was just goin' ter scarper

     so we never done nuffin' at all
          music hall song

     bigwig wavered gradually up from sleep, like a bubble of marsh gas from the
bed of a still stream. there was another rabbit beside him in the burrow -- a buck.
he started up at once and said, "who is it?"
     "avens," replied the other. "time for silflay, thlayli. larks have gone up.
you're a sound sleeper."
     "i dare say," said bigwig. "well, i'm ready." he was about to lead the way down
the run, but avens' next words brought him to a halt.
     "who's fiver?" said avens.
     bigwig grew tense. 
 
 ___________________________
 
"what did you say?"
     "i said, who's fiver?"
     "how should i know?"
     "well, you were talking in your sleep. you kept saying, 'ask fiver, ask fiver.' i
wondered who he was."
     "oh, i see. a rabbit i knew once. he used to foretell the weather and so on."

     "well, he could do it now, then. can you smell the thunder?"
     bigwig sniffed. mixed with the scents of grass and cattle came the warm, thick
smell of a heavy cloud mass, still far off. he perceived it uneasily. almost all
animals are disturbed by the approach of thunder, which oppresses them with its
mounting tension and breaks the natural rhythm by which they live. bigwig's
inclination was to go back to his burrow, but he had little doubt that no mere
trifle like a thundery morning would be allowed to interfere with the timetable of
an efrafan mark.
     he was

 right. chervil was already at the entrance, squatting opposite blackavar
and his escort. he looked round as his officers came up the run.
     "come on, thlayli," he said. "sentries are out already. does the thunder worry
you?"
     "it does rather," replied bigwig.
     "it won't break today," said chervil. "it's a long way off yet. i'd give it until
tomorrow evening. anyway, don't let the mark see it affects you. nothing's to be
altered unless the general says so."
     "couldn't wake him up," said avens, with a touch of malice. "there was a doe
in your burrow last night, thlayli, wasn't there?"
     "oh, was there?" said chervil. "which one?"
     "hyzenthlay," replied bigwig.
     "oh, the marli tharn,"* said chervil. "funny, i didn't think she was re

ady."
     "she wasn't," said bigwig. "i made a mistake. but if you remember, you asked
me to do what i could to get to know the awkward squad and bring them a bit
more under control, so i kept her talking for a time, just the same."
     "get anywhere?"
     "hard to say, really," said bigwig, "but i'll keep at it."
     he spent the time while the mark went out in deciding upon the best and
quickest way to enter the hole and attack blackavar's escort. he would have to put
one of them out of action in no time at all and then go straight for the other, who
would be that much less unprepared. if he had to fight him, it would be better to
avoid doing it between blackavar and the mouth of the hole, for blackavar would
be as bewildered as the rest and might bolt back down the run. if he

that. efrafan owslafa were not given to running away.
     as he went out into the field, he wondered whether he would be spotted by
kehaar. the arrangement had been that kehaar would find him whenever he
might come above ground on the second day.
     he need not have worried. kehaar had been over efrafa since before dawn. as
soon as he saw the mark come up, he alighted a little way out in the field, halfway
between the undergrowth and the sentry line, and began pecking about in the
grass. bigwig nibbled his way slowly toward him and then settled down to feed
without a glance in his direction. after a while, he sensed that kehaar was behind
him, a little to one side.
     "meester pigvig, i t'ink ees not goot ve talk much. meester 'azel, 'e say vat you
do? vat you vant?"
     "i want two things, kehaar -- both at sunset tonight. first, our rabbits must be

 off. you'll see me come out again
almost at once and then the does -- the mothers -- will start running with me and
we'll go straight down to the arch. but we may very well be attacked on the way. if
that happens, can you pile in again?"
     "ya, ya. i fly at dem -- dey no stop you."
     "splendid. that's it, then. hazel and the others -- are they all right?"
     "fine -- fine. dey say you damn good fella. meester pluebell, 'e say to pring one
mudder for everyone else and two for 'im."
     bigwig was trying to think of some appropriate reply to this when he saw
chervil running across the grass toward him. at once, without speaking again to
kehaar, he took a few hops in chervil's direction and began biting busily at a
patch of clover. as chervil came up, kehaar flew low above their heads and
disappeared over the trees.
     chervil looked after the flying gull and then turned to bigwig.
     "aren't you afraid of those birds?" he asked.
     "not particularly," answered bigwig.
     "the

y sometimes attack mice, you know, and rabbit kittens, too," said chervil.
"you were taking a risk, feeding there. why were you so careless?"
     for answer, bigwig sat up and gave chervil a playful cuff, hard enough to roll
him over.
     "that's why," he said.
     chervil got up with a sulky air. "all right, so you're heavier than i am," he said.
"but you've got to learn, thlayli, that there's more than weight to being an
efrafan officer. and it doesn't alter the fact that those birds can be dangerous.
anyway, it's not the season for them and that's odd, for a start. it'll have to be
reported."
     "whatever for?"
     "because it's unusual. everything

 unusual has to be reported. if we don't
report it and someone else does, nice fools we shall look when we have to say we
saw it. we couldn't say we didn't -- several of the mark have seen it. in fact, i shall
go and report it now. silflay's nearly over, so if i'm not back in time, you and
avens had better see the mark underground yourselves."
     as soon as chervil had left him, bigwig went to look for hyzenthlay. he found
her in the hollow with thethuthinnang. most of the mark did not appear to be
unduly affected by the thunder, which was still distant, as chervil had said. the
two does, however, were subdued and nervous. bigwig told them what he had
arranged with kehaar.
     "but will this bird really attack the sentries?" asked thethuthinnang. "i've
never heard of anything like that."

     "it will, i promise you. get the does together as soon as silflay begins this
eve

ning. when i come out with blackavar, the sentries will be running for cover."
     "and which way do we run?" asked thethuthinnang.
     bigwig took them well out into the field, so that they could see the distant arch
in the embankment about four hundred yards away.
     "we're bound to meet campion," said thethuthinnang. "you know that?"
     "i believe he had some trouble stopping blackavar," replied bigwig. "so i'm
sure he won't be good enough for me and the bird. look, there's avens bringing
in the sentries -- we'll have to go. now, don't worry. chew your pellets and get
some sleep. if you can't sleep, sharpen up your claws: you may need them."
     the mark went underground and blackavar was taken away by the escort.
bigwig returned to his burrow and tried to put the coming evening out of his
mind. after some time he gave up the idea of spending the day alone. he made a
round of the lower burro

nd himself in the middle of the ni-frith silflay with the left flank mark
and went underground with them. their officers shared a single large burrow and
here he met some experienced veterans and listened with interest to their stories
of wide patrols and other exploits. in the mid-afternoon he came back to the
near hind relaxed and confident, and slept until one of the sentries woke him for
silflay.
     he went up the run. blackavar was already slumped in his alcove. squatting
beside chervil, bigwig watched the mark go out. hyzenthlay and thethuthinnang
passed him without a glance. they looked tense but steady. chervil followed the
last rabbit.
     bigwig waited until he was sure that chervil had had time to get well away
from the hole. then, with a last, quick look to where blackavar was sitting, he
went out himself. the bright sunset dazzled him and he sat up on his hind legs,
blinking and combing the fur along one side of his face as his eyes got accustomed
to the light. a few moments

later he saw kehaar come flying across the field.
     "this is it, then," he said to himself. "here we go."
     at that moment a rabbit spoke from behind him.
     "thlayli, i want a few words with you. just come back under the bushes, will
you?"
     bigwig dropped on his front paws and looked round.
     it was general woundwort.

     *marli -- a doe. tharn -- stupefied, distraught. in this particular context, the
nearest translation might be "the maiden all forlorn."

     bigwig's first impulse was to fight woundwort on the spot. he realized
immediately that this would be futile and would only

bring the whole place round
his ears. there was nothing to do but obey. he followed woundwort through the
undergrowth and into the shade of the bridle path. despite the sunset, the
evening seemed heavy with cloud and among the trees it was sultry and gray. the
thunder was building up. he looked at woundwort and waited.
     "you were out of the near hind burrows this afternoon?" began woundwort.
     "yes, sir," replied bigwig. he still disliked addressing woundwort as "sir," but
since he was supposed to be an efrafan officer, he could not very well do
otherwise. however, he did not add that chervil had given him permission. he
had not been accused of anything as yet.
     "where did you go?"
     bigwig swallowed his annoyance. no doubt woundwort knew perfectly well
where he had been.
     "i went to the left flank mark, sir. i was in their burrows."
     "why did you go?"
     "to pass the time and learn something 
 
 ___________________________
 
from listening to the officers."
     "did you go anywhere else?"
     "no, sir."
     "you met one of the left flank owsla -- a rabbit named groundsel."
     "very likely. i didn't learn all their names."
     "have you ever seen that rabbit before?"
     "no, sir. how could i?"
     there was a pause.
     "may i ask what this is all about, sir?" said bigwig.
     "i'll ask the questions," said woundwort. "groundsel has seen you before. he
knew you by the fur on your head. where do you think he saw you?"
     "i've no idea."
     "have you ever run from a fox?"
     "yes, sir, a few days ago, while i was coming here."
     "you led it onto some other rabbits and it killed one of them. is that correct?"
     "i didn't intend to lead it onto them. i didn't know they were there."
     "you didn't tell us anything about this?"
     "it never occurred t

eyes.
     "then one more question, thlayli. that patrol was on the track of a band of
rabbits -- strangers. what do you know about them?"
     "i saw their tracks too, about that time. i can't tell you any more than that."
     "you weren't with them?"
     "if i'd been with them, sir, would i have come to efrafa?"
     "i told you i'd ask the questions. you can't tell me where they might have

gone?"
     "i'm afraid i can't, sir."
     woundwort stopped staring and sat silent for some time. bigwig felt that the
general was waiting for him to ask if that was all and whether he could now go.
he determined to remain silent himself.
     "now there's another thing," said woundwort at last. "about this white bird in
the field this morning. you're not afraid of these birds?"
     "no, sir. i've never heard of one hurting a rabbit."
     "but they have been known to, for all your wide experience, thlayli. anyway,
why did you go near it?"
     bigwig thought quickly. "to tell you the truth, sir,

ression on captain chervil."
     "well, you could have a worse reason. but if you're going to impress anyone,
you'd better start with me. the day after tomorrow i'm taking out a wide patrol
myself. it will cross the iron road and try to pick up traces of those rabbits -- the
rabbits mallow would have found if you hadn't gone and blundered into him. so
you'd better come along and show us how good you are then."
     "very well, sir; i shall be glad to."
     there was another silence. this time bigwig decided to make as if to go. he did
so, and immediately a fresh question stopped him short.
     "when you were with hyzenthlay, did she tell you why she was put into the
near hind mark?"
     "yes, sir."
     "i'm not at all sure the trouble's over there, thlayli. keep an eye on it. if she'll
talk to you, so much the better. perhaps those does are settling down and perhaps
they aren't. i want to know."
     "very well, sir," said bigwig.
     "that's all," said woundwort. "you'd better get bac

k to your mark now."
     bigwig made his way into the field. the silflay was almost over, the sun had set
and it was growing dark. heavy clouds dimmed the afterlight. kehaar was
nowhere to be seen. the sentries came in and the mark began to go underground.
sitting alone in the grass, he waited until the last rabbit had disappeared. there
was still no sign of kehaar. he hopped slowly to the hole. entering, he knocked
into one of the police escort, who was blocking the mouth to make sure that
blackavar did not try to bolt as he

 was taken down.
     "get out of my way, you dirty little tale-bearing bloodsucker," said bigwig.
"now go and report that," he added over his shoulder, as he went down to his
burrow.

          -<*>-

     as the light faded from the thick sky, hazel slipped once more across the hard,
bare earth under the railway arch, came out on the north side and sat up to listen.
a few moments later fiver joined him and they crept a little way into the field,
toward efrafa. the air was close and warm and smelled of rain and ripening
barley. there was no sound close by, but behind and below them, from t

eadow on the nearer bank of the test, came faintly the shrill, incessant fussing

of a pair of sandpipers. kehaar flew down from the top of the embankment.
     "you're sure he said tonight?" asked hazel for the third time.
     "ees bad," said kehaar. "maybe dey catch 'im. ees finish meester pigvig. you
t'ink?"
     hazel made no reply.
     "i can't tell," said fiver. "clouds and thunder. that place up the field -- it's like
the bottom of a river. anything could be happening in there."
     "bigwig's there. suppose he's dead? suppose they're trying to make him tell
them--"
     "hazel," said fiver. "hazel-rah, you won't help him by staying here in the dark
and worrying. quite likely there's nothing wrong. he's just had to sit tight for
some reason. anyway, he won't come tonight -- that's certain now -- and our
rabbits are in danger here. kehaar can go up tomorrow at dawn and bring us
another message."
     "i dare say you're right," said hazel, "but i hate to go. just suppose he were to

you're trying to eat grass that isn't there. why don't you give it a chance to grow?"
     they returned under the arch and as silver came out of the bushes to meet
them, they could hear the other rabbits stirring uneasily among the nettles.
     "we'll have to give it up for tonight, silver," said hazel. "we must get them
back over the river now, before it's completely dark."
     "hazel-rah," said pipkin, as he slipped by, "it -- it is going to be all right, isn't
it? bigwig will come tomorrow, won't he?"
     "of course he will," said hazel, "and we'll all be here to help him. and i'll tell
you something else, hlao-roo. if he doesn't come tomorrow, i'm going into efrafa
myself."
     "i'll come with you, hazel-rah," said pipkin.

          -<*>-

     bigwig crouched in his burrow, pressed against hyzenthlay. he was trembling,
but not with cold: the stuffy runs of the mark were dense with thunder; the air
felt like a deep drift of leaves. bigwig was close to utter
 
 ___________________________
 
 nervous exhaustion. since
leaving general woundwort, he had become more and more deeply entangled in
all the age-old terrors of the conspirator. how much had woundwort discovered?
clearly, there was no information that failed to reach him. he knew that hazel
and the rest had come from the north and crossed the iron road. he knew about
the fox. he knew that a gull, which should have been far away at this time of year,
was hanging round efrafa and that he, bigwig, had deliberately been near it. he
knew that bigwig had made a friend of hyzenthlay. how long could it be before
he took the final step of fitting all these things together? perhaps he had already
done so and was merely waiting to arrest them in his own time?
     woundwort had every advantage. he sat secure at the junction of all paths,
seeing clearly down each, while he, bigwig, ludicrous in his efforts to measure up
to him as an enemy, clambered clumsily and ignorantly through the
undergrowt

e? perhaps they had already been spotted by
campion on patrol? to speak to blackavar would be suspect. to go near kehaar
would be suspect. through more holes than he could possibly stop, his secret was
leaking -- pouring -- out.
     there was worse to come.
     "thlayli," whispered hyzenthlay, "do you think you and i and thethuthinnang
could get away tonight? if we fought the sentry at the mouth of the run, we might
be able to get clear before a patrol could start after us."
     "why?" asked bigwig. "what makes you ask that?"
     "i'm frightened. we told the other does, you see, just before the silflay. they
were ready to run when the bird attacked the sentries, and then nothing
happened. they all know about the plan -- nelthilta and the rest -- and it can't be
long before the council find out. of course we've told them that their lives depend
on keeping quiet and that you're going to try again. thethuthinnang's watching
them now: she says she'll do her best not to sleep. but no secret c

an be kept in
efrafa. it's even possible that one of the does is a spy, although frith knows we
chose them as carefully as we could. we may all be arrested before tomorrow
morning."
     bigwig tried to think clearly. he could certainly succeed in getting out with a
couple of resolute, sensible does. but the sentry -- unless he could kill him --
would raise the alarm at once and he could not be sure of finding the way to the
river in the dark. even if he did, it was possible that the pursuit might follow him
over the plank bridge and into the middle of his unprepared, sleeping friends.
and at the best he would have come out of efrafa with no more than a couple of
does, because his ner

ly that he had run away.
     "no, we mustn't give up yet," he said, as gently as he could. "it's the thunder
and the waiting that make you feel so much upset. listen, i promise you that by
this time tomorrow you'll be out of efrafa forever and the others with you. now
go to sleep here for a little while and then go back and help thethuthinnang. keep
thinking of those high downs and all that i told you. we'll get there -- our
troubles won't last much longer."
     as she fell asleep beside him, bigwig wondered how on earth he was going to
fulfill this promise and whether they would be woken by the council police. "if we
are," he thought, "i'll fight until they tear me to bits. they'll make no blackavar
out of me."

          -<*>-

     when he woke, he found that he was alone in the burrow. for a moment he
wondered whether hyzenthlay had been arrested. then he felt sure that the
owslafa could not have removed her while he slept. she must have woken and
slipped back to thethuthinnang without

 disturbing him.
     it was a little before dawn, but the oppression in the air had not lessened. he
slipped up the run to the entrance. moneywort, the sentry on duty, was peering
uneasily out of the mouth of the hole, but turned as he approached.

     "i wish it would rain, sir," he said. "the thunder's enough to turn the grass
sour, but not much hope of it breaking before the evening, i'd say."
     "it's bad luck for the mark's last day on dawn and evening," replied bigwig.
"go and wake captain chervil. i'll take your place here until the mark come up."
     when moneywort had gone, bigwig sat in the mouth of the hole and sniffed
the heavy air. the sky seemed as close as the tops of the trees, covered with still
cloud and flushed on the morning side with a lurid, foxy glow. not a lark was up,
not a thrush singing. the field before him was empty and motionless. the longing
to run came over him. in less than no time he could be down to the arch. it was a
safe bet t

hat campion and his patrol would not be out in weather like this. every
living creature up and down the fields and copses must be muted, pressed down
as though under a great, soft paw. nothing would be moving, for the day was
unpropitious and instincts were blurred and not to be trusted. it was a time to
crouch and be silent. but a fugitive would be safe. indeed, he could not hope for a
better chance.
     "o lord with the starlight ears, send me a sign!" said bigwig.
     he heard movement in the run behind him. it was the owslafa bringing up the
prisoner. in the thundery twilight, blackavar looked more sick and dejected than
ever. his nose was dry and the whites of his eyes showed. bigwig went out into
the field, pulled a mouthful of clover and brought it back.
     "cheer up," he said to blackavar. "have some clover."
     "that's not allowed, sir," said one of the escort.
     "oh, let him have it, bartsia," said the other. "there's no one to see. it's 
 
 ___________________________
 
hard
enough for everyone on a day like this, let alone the prisoner."
     blackavar ate the clover and bigwig took up his usual place as chervil arrived
to watch the mark go out.
     the rabbits were slow and hesitant and chervil himself seemed unable to rise
to his usual brisk manner. he had little to say as they passed him. he let both
thethuthinnang and hyzenthlay go by in silence. nelthilta, however, stopped of
her own accord and stared impudently at him.
     "under the weather, captain?" she said "brace up, now. you may have a
surprise soon, who knows?"
     "what do you mean?" answered chervil 
 
 ___________________________
 
sharply.
     "does might grow wings and fly," said nelthilta, "and before very much longer,
too. secrets go faster than moles underground."
     she followed the other does into the field. for a moment chervil looked as
though he were going to call her back.
     "i wonder whether you could have a look at my off hind foot?" said bigwig. "i
think i've got a thorn in it."
     "come on, then," said chervil, "outside. not that we'll be able to see much
better there."
     but whether because he was still thinking about what nelthilta had said, or for
some other reason, he did not make a particularly thorough search for the thorn
-- which was perhaps as well, for there was no thorn there.
     "oh, confound it!" he said, looking up, "there's that dratted white bird again.
what's it keep coming here for?"
     "why does it worry y
 
 ___________________________
 
ou?" asked bigwig. "it's not doing any harm -- only

looking for snails."
     "anything out of the ordinary is a possible source of danger," replied chervil,
quoting woundwort. "and you keep away from it today, thlayli, d'you see? that's
an order."
     "oh, very well," said bigwig. "but surely you know how to get rid of them? i
thought all rabbits knew that."
     "don't be ridiculous. you're not suggesting attacking a bird that size, with a
beak as thick as my front paw?"
     "no, no -- it's a sort of charm thing that my mother taught me. you know, like
'ladybird, ladybird, fly away home.' that works and so does this -- or it always
used to with my mother."
     "the ladybird thing only works because all ladybirds crawl to the top of the
stem and then fly."
     "well,
 
 ___________________________
 
 all right," said bigwig, "have it your own way. but you don't like the bird
and i've offered to get rid of it for you. we had a lot of these charms and sayings
in my old warren. i only wish we'd had one to get rid of men."
     "well, what is the charm?" said chervil.
     "you say,

     "o fly away, great bird so white,
     and don't come back until tonight.

     "of course, you have to use hedgerow talk. no use expecting them to
understand lapine. let's have a go, anyway. if it doesn't work, we're none the
worse,
 
 ___________________________
 
ck until tonight.

     "there you are, you see. it did work. i think there's more than we know to
some of these old rhymes and spells. of course, it might have been just going to
fly away anyway. but you must admit it's gone."
     "probably all that prancing about as we came up to it," said chervil sourly. "we
must have looked completely mad. what on earth will the mark think? anyway,
now we're out here, we may as well go round the sentries."
     "i'll stop and feed, if you don't mind," said bigwig. "i didn't get much last
night, you know."

          -<*>-

     bigwig's luck was not altogether out. later that morning, quite unexpectedly,
he came upon a chance to talk to blackavar alone. he had been through the
sweltering burrows, finding everywhere quick breathing and feverish pulses; and

he was just wondering whether he could not plausibly go and press chervil to ask
the council's permission for the mark to spend part of the day in the bushes
above ground -- for that might very well

bring some sort of opportunity with it --
when he began to feel the need to pass hraka. no rabbit passes hraka
underground: and, like schoolchildren who know that they cannot very well be
refused a request to go to the lavatory as long as it is not too soon after the last
time, the efrafan rabbits used to slip into the ditch for a breath of air and a
change of scene. although they were not supposed to be allowed to go more often
than was necessary, some of the owsla were easier than others. as bigwig
approached the hole that led into the ditch, he found two or three young bucks
loitering in the run and, as usual, set himself to act his part as convincingly as he
could.
     "why are you hanging about here?" he asked.
     "the prisoner's escort are up at the hole and they turned us back, sir,"
answered one. "they're not letting anyone out for the moment."
     "not to pass hraka?" said bigwig.
     "no, sir."
     indignant, bigwig made his way to the mouth of the hole. here he found
blacka

var's escort talking to the sentry on duty.
     "i'm afraid you can't go out for the moment, sir," said bartsia. "the prisoner's
in the ditch, but he won't be long."
     "neither shall i," said bigwig. "just get out of the way, will you?" he pushed
bartsia to one side and hopped into the ditch.
     the day had become even more lowering and overcast. blackavar was
squatting a little way off, under an overhanging plume of cow parsley. the flies
were walking on his shreds of ears, but he seemed not to notice them. bigwig
went along the ditch and squatted beside him.
     "blackavar, listen," he said quickly. "this is the truth, by frith and the black
rabbit. i am a secret enemy of efrafa. no o

s this but you and a few of the
mark does. i'm going to escape with them tonight and i'm going to take you as
well. don't do anything yet. when the time comes i'll be there to tell you. just
brace up and get yourself ready."
     without waiting for an answer, he moved away as though to find a better spot.
even so, he was back at the hole before blackavar, who evidently meant to stay
outside for as long as the escort -- clearly in no hurry themselves -- would allow.
     "sir," said bartsia, as bigwig came in, "that's the third time, sir, that you've
disregarded my authority. council police can't be treated in this way. i'm afraid i
shall have to report it, sir."
     bigwig made no reply and returned up the run.
     "wait a bit longer if you can," he said as he passed the bucks. "i don't suppose
that poor fellow will get out again today."
     he wondered whether to go and look for hyzenthlay, but decided that it would
be prudent to keep away from her. she knew what to do, and the less the

     "ya, say dis, but not 'appen. den 'e say go away, come again tonight."
     "so that's still what he means to do. the question is, when will they be
feeding? it's getting dark already. silver, what do you think?"
     "if i know them, they won't alter anything they usually do," said silver. "but if
you're worried in case we're not there in time, why not go now?"
     "because they're always patrolling. the longer we wait up there, the greater the
risk. if a patrol finds us before bigwig comes, it won't be just a matter of getting
ourselves away. they'll realize we're there for some purpose and give the alarm,
and that'll be the end of any chance he's got."
     "listen, hazel-rah," said blackberry. "we ought to reach the iron road at the
same time as bigwig and not a moment before. why don't you take them all over
the river now and wait in the undergrowth, near the boat? once kehaar's attacked
the sentries, he can fly back and tell us."
     "yes, that's it," answered hazel. "

but once he's told us, we must get up there in
no time at all. bigwig's going to need us as well as kehaar."
     "well, you won't be able to dash up to the arch," said fiver, "with your leg. the
best thing you can do is to get on the boat and have the rope gnawed half through
by the time we come back. silver can look after the fighting, if there's going to be
any."
     hazel hesitated. "but some of us are probably going to get hurt. i can't stay
behind."
     "fiver's right," said blackberry. "you will have to wait on the boat, hazel. we
can't risk your being l

eft to be picked up by the efrafans. besides, it's very
important that the rope should be half gnawed -- that's a job for someone
sensible. it mustn't break too soon or we're all finished."
     it took them some time to persuade hazel. when at last he agreed, he was still
reluctant.
     "if bigwig doesn't come tonight," he said, "i shall go and find him, wherever he
is. frith knows what may have happened already."
     as they set off up the left bank, the wind began to blow in fitful, warm gusts,
with a multifoliate rustling through the sedges. they had just reached the plank
bridge when there came a rumble of thunder. in the intense, strange light, the
plants and leaves seemed magnified and the fields beyond the river very near.
there was an oppressive stillness.
     "you know, hazel-

rah," said bluebell, "this really is the funniest evening i've

ever gone looking for a doe."
     "it's going to get a lot funnier soon," said silver. "there'll be lightning and
pouring rain. for goodness' sake, all of you, don't panic, or we'll never see our
warren again. i think this is going to be a rough business," he added quietly to
hazel. "i don't like it much."

          -<*>-

     bigwig woke to hear his name repeated urgently.
     "thlayli! thlayli! wake up! thlayli!"
     it was hyzenthlay.
     "what is it?" he said. "what's the matter?"
     "nelthilta's been arrested."
     bigwig leaped to his feet.
     "how long ago? how did it happen?"
     "just now. moneywort came down to our burrow and told her to come up to
captain chervil at once. i followed them up the run. when she got to chervil's
burrow, there were two council police waiting just outside and one of them said

 
 ___________________________
 
to chervil, 'well, as quick as you can, and don't be long.' and then they took her
straight out. they must have gone to the council. oh, thlayli, what shall we do?
she'll tell them everything--"
     "listen to me," said bigwig. "there's not a moment to lose. go and get
thethuthinnang and the others and bring them up to this burrow. i shan't be

everything depends on it."
     hyzenthlay had hardly disappeared down the run when bigwig heard another
rabbit approaching from the opposite direction.
     "who's there?" he said, turning swiftly.
     "chervil," answered the other. "i'm glad you're awake. listen, thlayli, there's
going to be a wh

ng for avens; he's not in his burrow. go and alert the
sentries yourself. send someone to find avens and someone else to tell bartsia
that blackavar won't be wanted this evening. then sit on those holes -- and the
hraka holes, too -- with every sentry you've got. for all i know, there may be some
plot to make a break-out. we arrested nelthilta as quietly as we could, but the
mark are bound to realize what's happened. if necessary you're to get rough, do
you see? now i'm off."
     "right," said bigwig. "i'll get busy at once."
     he followed chervil to the top of the run. the sentry at the hole was marjoram.

as he stood clear to let chervil pass, bigwig came up behind him and looked out
into the overcast.
     "did chervil tell you?" he said. "silflay's early tonight, on account of the
weather. the orders are that we're to get on with it at once."
     he waited for marjoram's reply. if chervil had already told him that no one
was to go out, it would be necessary to fight him. but after

said, "have you heard any thunder yet?"
     "get on with it at once, i said," answered bigwig. "go down and get blackavar
and the escort up, and be quick, too. we'll need to get the mark out immediately
if they're to feed before the storm breaks."
     marjoram went and bigwig hurried back to his own burrow. hyzenthlay had
lost no time. three or four does were crammed into the burrow itself and nearby,
in a side run, thethuthinnang was crouching with several more. all were silent
and frightened and one or two were close to the stupefaction of terror.
     "this is no time to go tharn," said bigwig. "your lives depend on doing as i say.
listen, now. blackavar and the police guards will be up directly. marjoram will
probably come up behind them and you must find some e

talking. soon after, you'll hear fighting, because i'm going to attack the police
guards. when you hear that, come up as fast as you can and follow me out into
the field. don't stop for anything."
     as he finished speaking, he heard the unmistakable sound of blackavar and the
guards approaching. blackavar's weary, dragging gait was like that of no other
rabbit. without waiting for the does to reply, bigwig returned to the mouth of the
run. the three rabbits came up in single file, bartsia leading.
     "i'm afraid i've brought you up here for nothing," said bigwig. "i've just been
told that silflay's canceled for this evening. have a look outside and you'll see
why."
     as bartsia went to look out of the hole, bigwig slipped quickly between him
and blackavar.
     "well, it looks very stormy, certainly," said bartsia, "but i shouldn't have
thought--"
     "now, blackavar!" cried bigwig, and lea

ped on bartsia from behind.
     bartsia fell forward out of the hole with bigwig on top of him. he was not a
member of the owslafa for nothing and was reckoned a good fighter. as they
rolled over on the ground, he turned his head and sank his teeth in bigwig's
shoulder. he had been trained to get a grip at once and to hold it at all costs.
more than once in the past this had served him well. but in fighting a rabbit of
bigwig's strength and courage it proved a mistake. his best chance would have
been to keep clear and use his claws. he retained his hold like a dog, and bigwig,
snarling, brought both his own back legs forward, sank his feet in bartsia's side
and then, ignoring the pain in his shoulder, forced himself upward. he felt
bartsia's closed teeth come tearing out through his flesh and then he was
standing above him as he fell back on the ground, kicking helplessly. bigwig
leaped clear. it was plain that bart

sia's haunch was injured. he struggled, but
could not get up.
     "think yourself lucky," said bigwig, bleeding and cursing, "that i don't kill
you."

     without waiting to see what bartsia would do, he jumped back into the hole.
he found blackavar grappling with the other guard. just beyond them,
hyzenthlay was coming up the run with thethuthinnang behind her. bigwig gave
the guard a tremendous cuff on the side of the head, which knocked him clear
across the run and into the prisoner's alcove. he picked himself up, panting, and
stared at bigwig without a word.
     "don't move," said bigwig. "there'll be worse to come if you do. blackavar, are
you all right?"
     "yes, sir," said blackavar, "but what do we do now?"
     "follow me," said bigwig, "all of you. come on!"
     he led the way out again. there was no sign of bartsia, but as he looked back

f rain were falling. along the western horizon the lower
clouds formed a single purple mass, against which distant trees stood out minute
and sharp. the upper edges rose into the light, a far land of wild mountains.
copper-colored, weightless and motionless, they suggested a glassy fragility like
that of frost. surely, when the thunder struck them again they would vibrate,
tremble and shatter, till warm shards, sharp as icicles, fell flashing down from the
ruins. racing through the ocher light, bigwig was impelled by a frenzy of tension
and energy. he did not feel the wound in his shoulder. the storm was his own.
the storm would defeat efrafa.
     he was well out into the great field and looking for a sight of the distant arch
when he felt along the ground the first stamping thuds of the alarm. he pulled up
and looked about him. there did not seem to be any stragglers. the does --
however many there were -- were well up with him, but scattered to either side.

he delay. then another thought came to him. if they
could get out of sight, their pursuers might be puzzled, for the rain and the failing
light would make tracking difficult.
     the rain was falling faster now and the wind was rising. over on the evening
side, a hedge ran down the length of the field toward the iron road. he saw
blackavar nearby and ran across to him.
     "i want everyone the other side of that hedge," he said. "can you get hold of
some of them and bring them that way?"
     bigwig remembered that blackavar knew nothing except that they were on the
run. there was no time to explain about hazel and the river.
     "go straight to that ash tree in the hedge," he said, "and take all the does you
can pick up on the way. get through to the other side and i'll be there as soon as
you are."
     at this moment hyzenthlay and thethuthinnang came running toward them,
followed by two or three other does. they were plainly confused and uncertain.

ed thethuthinnang. "they're coming!"
     "well, run, then," said bigwig. "keep near me, all of you."
     they were better runners than he had dared to hope. as they made for the ash
tree, more does fell in with them and it seemed to him that they ought now to be a
match for a patrol, unless it were a very strong one. once through the hedge he
turned south and, keeping close beside it, led them down the slope. there, ahead
of him, was the arch in the overgrown embankment. but would hazel be there?
and where was kehaar?

     "well, and what was to

saw him take," said woundwort.
     as they came out from the crixa, two or three of the efrafan officers checked at
the sight of the murky light and increasing rain. but the sight of the general was
more alarming still. pausing only to stamp the escape alarm, they set out behind
him toward the iron road.
     very soon they came upon traces of blood which the rain had not yet washed
away, and these they followed toward the ash tree in the hedge to the west of the
warren.

          -<*>-

     bigwig came out from the further side of the railway arch, sat up and looked
round him. there was no sign either of hazel or of kehaar. for the first time since

he had attacked bartsia he began to feel uncertain and troubled. perhaps, after
all, kehaar had not understood his cryptic message that morning? or had some
disaster overtaken hazel and the rest? if they were dead -- scattered -- if there
was no one left alive to meet him? he and his does would wander about the fields
until the patrols hunte

d them down.
     "no, it shan't come to that," said bigwig to himself. "at the worst we can cross
the river and try to hide in the woodland. confound this shoulder! it's going to be
more nuisance than i thought. well, i'll try to get them down to the plank bridge
at least. if we're not overtaken soon, perhaps the rain will discourage whoever's
after us; but i doubt it."
     he turned back to the does waiting under the arch. most of them looked
bewildered. hyzenthlay had promised that they were to be protected by a great
bird and that the new officer w

they were wet through. runnels of water were trickling through the arch from
the uphill side, and the bare earth was beginning to turn into mud. ahead of them
there was nothing to be seen but a track leading through the nettles into another
wide and empty field.
     "come on," said bigwig. "it's not far now and then we'll all be safe. this way."
     all the rabbits obeyed him at once. there was something to be said for efrafan
discipline, thought bigwig grimly, as they left the arch and met the force of the
rain.
     along one side of the field, beside the elms, farm tractors had pounded a
broad, flat path downhill toward the water meadow below -- that same path up
which he had run three nights before, after he had left hazel by the boat. it was
turning muddy now -- unpleasant

 going for rabbits -- but at least it led straight to
the river and was open enough for kehaar to spot them if he should turn up.
     he had just begun to run once more when a rabbit overtook him.
     "stop, thlayli! what are you doing here? where are you going?"
     bigwig had been half expecting campion to appear and had made up his mind
to kill him if necessary. but now that he actually saw him at his side, disregarding
the storm and the mud, self-possessed as he led his patrol, no more than four
strong, into the thick of a pack of desperate runaways, he could feel only what a
pity it was that the two of them should be enemies and how much he would have
liked to have taken campion with him out of efrafa.
     "go away," he said. "don't try to stop us, campion. 
 
 ___________________________
 
i don't want to hurt you."
     he glanced to his other side. "blackavar, get the does to close up. if there are
any stragglers the patrol will jump on them."
     "you'd do better to give in now," said campion, still running beside him. "i
shan't let you out of my sight, wherever you go. there's an escape patrol on the
way -- i heard the signal. when they get here you won't stand a chance. you're
bleeding badly now."
     "curse you!" cried bigwig, striking at him. "you'll bleed too, before i've done."
     "can i fight him, sir?" said blackavar. "he won't beat me a second time."
     "no," answered bigwig, "he's only trying to delay us. keep running."
     "thlayli!" cried thethuthinnang suddenly, from behind him. "the general!
the general! oh, what shall we do?"

     bigwig looked back. it was indeed a sight to strike terror into the bravest heart.

 by himself, snarling with fury. behind him came the patrol. in one
quick glance bigwig recognized chervil, avens and groundsel. with them were
several more, including a heavy, savage-looking rabbit whom he guessed to be
vervain, the head of the council police. it crossed his mind that if he were to run,
immediately and alone, they would probably let him go as he had come, and feel
glad to be so easily rid of him. certainly the alternative was to be killed. at this
moment blackavar spoke.
     "never mind, sir," he said. "you did your very best and it nearly came off. we
may even

be able to kill one or two of them before it's finished. some of these
does can fight well when they're put to it."
     bigwig rubbed his nose quickly against blackavar's mutilated ear and sat back
on his haunches as woundwort came up to them.
     "you dirty little beast," said woundwort. "i hear you've attacked one of the
council police and broken his leg. we'll settle with you here. there's no need to
take you back to efrafa."
     "you crack-brained slave-driver," answered bigwig. "i'd like to see you try."
     "all right," said woundwort, "that's enough. who have we got? vervain,
campion, put him down. the rest of you, start getting these does back to the
warren. the prisoner you can leave to me."
     "frith sees you!" cried bigwig. "you're not fit to be called a rabbit! may frith
blast you and your foul owsla full of bullies!"
     at that instant a dazzling claw of lightning streaked down the length of the sky.
the hedge and the distant trees seemed to leap forward

y upon it came the thunder: a high, tearing noise, as though
some huge thing were being ripped to pieces close above, which deepened and
turned to enormous blows of dissolution. then the rain fell like a waterfall. in a
few seconds the ground was covered with water and over it, to a height of inches,
rose a haze formed of a myriad minute splashes. stupefied with the shock, unable
even to move, the sodden rabbits crouched inert, almost pinned to the earth by
the rain.
     a small voice spoke in bigwig's mind.
     "your storm, thlayli-rah. use it."
     gasping, he struggled up and pushed blackavar with his foot.
     "come on," he said, "get hold of hyzenthlay. we're going."
     he shook his head, trying to blink the rain out of his eyes. then it was no
longer blackavar who was crouching in front of him but woundwort, drenched in
mud and rain, glaring and scrabbling in the silt with his great claws.
     "i'll kill you myself," said woundwort.
     his long front teeth were bared like the

fangs of a rat. afraid, bigwig watched
him closely. he knew that woundwort, with all the advantage of weight, would
jump and try to close with him. he must try to avoid him and rely on his claws.
he shifted his ground uneasily and felt himself slipping in the mud. why did
woundwort not jump? then he realized that woundwort was no longer looking
at him, but staring over his head at something beyond, something that he himself
could not see. suddenly, woundwort leaped backward and in the same moment,

g sound of the rain, there sounded a raucous clamor.
     "yark! yark! yark!"
     some big white thing was striking at woundwort, who was cowering and
guarding his head as best he could. then it was gone, sailing upward and turning
in the rain.
     "meester pigvig, ees rabbits come!"
     sights and feelings swirled through bigwig as though in a dream. the things
that were happening no longer seemed connected by anything except his own
dazed senses. he heard kehaar screaming as he dived again to attack vervain. he
felt the rain pouring cold into the open gash in his shoulder. through the curtain
of rain he glimpsed woundwort dodging among his officers and urging them back
into the ditch on the edge of the field. he saw blackavar striking at campion and
campion turning to run. then someone beside him was saying, "hullo, b

     "where's hazel?" he said.
     "waiting at the boat. i say, you're wounded! what--"
     "then get these does down there," said bigwig.
     all was confusion. in ones and twos the does, utterly bemused and scarcely
able to move or to understand what was said to them, were urged into getting up
and stumbling their way down the field. other rabbits began to appear through
the rain: acorn, clearly frightened, but determined not to run; dandelion
encouraging pipkin; speedwell and hawkbit making toward kehaar -- the only
creature visible above the ground haze. bigwig and silver brought them together
as best they could and made the

     "go back to blackberry, go back to blackberry," silver kept repeating. "i left
three of our rabbits in different places to mark the way back," he explained to
bigwig. "blackberry's first, then bluebell, then fiver -- he's quite near the river."
     "and there is blackberry," said bigwig.
     "you did it, then, bigwig," said blackberry, shivering. "was it very bad? good
heavens, your shoulder--"
     "it's not finished yet," said bigwig. "has everyone passed you?"
     "you're the last," said blackberry. "can we go? this storm's terrifying me!"
     kehaar alighted beside them.
     "meester pigvig," he said, "i fly on does damn rabbits, but dey no run, dey get
in ditch. i no catch 'em in dere. dey coming all along beside you."
     "they'll never give up," said bigwig. "i warn you, silver, they'll be at us before

rushes, the bushes and sedge and deep puddles, they found it next to impossible
to tell their direction. expecting to be attacked at any moment, they scuttered and
floundered through the undergrowth, finding here a doe and there one of their
own rabbits and forcing them on. without kehaar they would certainly have lost
all touch with each other and perhaps never reached the river. the gull kept flying
backward and forward along the direct line to the bank, only alighting now and
then to guide bigwig toward some straggling doe whom he had spotted going the
wrong way.
     "kehaar," said bigwig, as they waited for thethuthinnang to struggle up to
them through a half-flattened clump of nettles, "will you go and see whether you
can spot the efrafans? they can't be far away. but why haven't they attacked us?
we're all so scattered that they could easily do us a lot of harm. i wonder what
they're up to?"
     kehaar was back in a very short time.
     "dey hiding at pridge," he said, "all under

     "did he?" said bigwig. "the brute's got courage, i'll give him that."

     fiver came running through the undergrowth.
     "we've been able to get some of them on the boat, bigwig," he said, "but most
of them won't trust me. they just keep asking where you are."
     bigwig ran behind him and came out on the green path by the bank. all the
surface of the river was winking and plopping in the rain. the level did not appear
to have risen much as yet. the boat was just as he remembered it -- one end
against the bank, the other a little way out in the stream. on the raised part at the
near end hazel was crouching, his ears drooping on either side of his head and his
flattened fur completely black with rain. he was holding the taut rope in his
teeth. acorn, hyzenthlay

and two more were crouching near him on the wood,
but the rest were huddled here and there along the bank. blackberry was trying
unsuccessfully to persuade them to get out on the boat.
     "hazel's afraid to leave the rope," he said to bigwig. "apparently he's bitten it
very thin already. all these does will say is that you're their officer."
     bigwig turned to thethuthinnang.
     "this is the magic trick now," he said. "get them over there, where
hyzenthlay's sitting, do you see? all of them -- quickly."
     before she could reply, another doe gave a squeal of fear. a little way
downstream, campion and his patrol had emerged from the bushes and were
coming up the path. from the opposite direction vervain, chervil and groundsel
were approaching. the doe turned and darted for the undergrowth immediately
behind her. just as she reached it, w

oundwort himself appeared in her way,
reared up and dealt her a great, raking blow across the face. the doe turned once
more and ran blindly across the path and onto the boat.
     bigwig realized that since the moment when kehaar had attacked him in the
field, woundwort had not only retained control over his officers but had actually

made a plan and put it into effect. the storm and the difficult going had upset the
fugitives and disorganized them. woundwort, on the other hand, had taken his
rabbits into the ditch and then made use of it to get them down to the water
meadow, unexposed to further attack from kehaar. once there, he must have
gone straight for the plank bridge -
 
 ___________________________
 
 without error or delay. now
woundwort meant to fight them, here on the bank. he knew that kehaar could
not be everywhere and that the bushes and undergrowth provided enough cover,
at a pinch, to dodge him. it was true that the other side had twice his numbers,
but most of them were afraid of him and none was a trained efrafan officer. now
that he had them pinned against the river, he would split them up and kill as
many as possible. the rest could run away and come to grief as they might.
     bigwig began to understand why woundwort's officers followed him and
fought for him as they did.
     "he's not like a rabbit at all," he thought. "flight's the last thing he ever thinks
of. if i'd known three nights ago what i know now, i don't believe i'd ever have
gone into efrafa. i suppose he hasn't realized about the boat, too? it wouldn't
surprise me." he dashed across the grass and jumped on the planking beside
hazel.
     the appearance of woundwort had achieved what blackberry and fiver coul

d
not. every one of the does ran from the bank to the boat. blackberry and fiver
ran with them. woundwort, following them close, reached the edge of the bank
and came face to face with bigwig. as he stood his ground, bigwig could hear
blackberry just behind him, speaking urgently to hazel.
     "dandelion's not here," said blackberry. "he's the only one."
     hazel spoke for the first time. "we shall have to leave him," he answered. "it's
a shame, but these fellows will be at us in a moment and we can't stop them."
     bigwig spoke without taking his eyes from woundwort. "just a few more
moments, hazel," he said. "i'll keep them off. we can't leave dandelion."
     woundwort sneered up at him. "i trusted you, th

layli," he said. "you can trust
me now. you'll either go into the river or be torn to pieces here -- the whole lot of
you. there's nowhere left to run."
     bigwig had caught sight of dandelion looking out of the undergrowth opposite.
he was plainly at a loss.
     "groundsel! vervain!" said woundwort. "come over here beside me. when i
give the word, we'll go straight into them. as for that bird, it's not dangerous--"
     "there it is!" cried bigwig. woundwort looked up quickly and leaped back.
dandelion shot out of the bushes, crossed the path in a flash and was on the boat
beside hazel. in the same moment the rope parted and immediately the little
punt began to move along the bank in the steady current. when it had gone a few
yards, the stern swung slowly outward until it was broadside on to the stream. in
this position it drifted to the middle of the river and into the southward bend.
     looking back, the last thing bigwig saw was the

bits, in the first
confusion of boarding the punt, had found themselves in this water, but now all
had got clear of it -- most either to bows or stern, though thethuthinnang and
speedwell were hunched on the narrow thwart, amidships. in addition to their
discomfort, they were exposed and helpless. finally, there was no way of
controlling the punt and they did not know where they were going. but these last
were troubles beyond the understanding of everyone but hazel, fiver and
blackberry.

     bigwig had collapsed beside hazel and lay on his side, exhausted. the feverish
courage which had brought him from efrafa to the river had gone and his
wounded shoulder had begun to hurt badly. in spite of the rain and the throbbing
pulse down his foreleg, he felt ready to sleep where he was, stretched upon the
planking. he opened his eyes and looked up at hazel.
     "i couldn't do it again, hazel-rah," he said.
     "you haven't got to," replied hazel.
     "it was touch and go, you know," said bigwi

g. "a chance in a thousand."
     "our children's children will hear a good story," answered hazel, quoting a
rabbit proverb. "how did you get that wound? it's a nasty one."
     "i fought a member of the council police," said bigwig.
     "a what?" the term "owslafa" was unknown to hazel.
     "a dirty little beast like hufsa," said bigwig.
     "did you beat him?"
     "oh, yes -- or i shouldn't be here. i should think he'll stop running. i say,
hazel-rah, we've got the does. what's going to happen now?"
     "i don't know," said hazel. "we need one of these clever rabbits to tell us. and
kehaar -- where's he gone? he's supposed to know about this thing we're sitting
on."
     dandelion, crouching beside hazel, got up at the mention of "clever rabbits,"
made his way across the puddled floor and returned with blackberry and fiver

.
     "we're all wondering what to do next," said hazel.
     "well," said blackberry, "i suppose we shall drift into the bank before long and
then we can get out and find cover. there's no harm, though, in going a good long
way from those friends of bigwig's."
     "there is," said hazel. "we're stuck here in full view and we can't run. if a man
sees us we're in trouble."
     "men don't like rain," said blackberry. "neither do i, if it comes to that, but it
makes us safer just now."
     at this moment hyzenthlay, sitting just behind him, started and looked up.
     "excuse me, sir, for interrupting you," she said, as though speaking to an
officer in efrafa, "but the bird -- the white bird -- it's coming toward us."
     kehaar came flying up th

so by no more than a claw's breadth. any creature above the level of the sides
would be struck and perhaps knocked into the river. he scuttered through the
warm bilgewater to the other end and pushed his way up among the wet, crowded
rabbits.
     "get down in the bottom! get down in the bottom!" he said. "silver, hawkbit --
all of you. never mind the water. you, and you -- what's your name? oh,
blackavar, is it? -- get everyone into the bottom. be quick."
     like bigwig, he found that the efrafan rabbits obeyed him at once. he saw
kehaar fly up from his perch and disappear over the wooden rails. the concrete
abutments projected from each bank, so that the narrowed river ran slightly
faster under the bridge. the punt had been drifting broadside on, but now one
end swung forward, so that hazel lost his bearings and found that he was no
longer looking at the bridge but at the bank. as he hesitated, the bridge seemed to
come at him in a dark mass, like snow slidin

? that there was slack water immediately below the bridge,
with a low, shelving bank where they could get out easily? that seemed too much
to hope for. or did he simply mean that they had better hurry up and take a
chance on being able to do what he himself could do without difficulty? this
seemed more likely. suppose one of them did jump out of the boat and go down
with the current -- what would that tell the others, if he did not come back?
     poor hazel looked about him. silver was licking bigwig's wounded shoulder.
blackberry was fidgeting on and off the thwart, strung up, able to feel only too
clearly all that hazel felt himself. as he still hesitated, kehaar let out a squawk.
     "yark! damn rabbits no goot. vat i do, i show you."
     he tumbled clumsily off the raised bow. there was no gap between the punt
and the dark mouth of the culvert. sitting low in the water like a mallard, he
floated into the tunnel and vanished. peering after him, hazel could at first see
nothing. then he

it floated into daylight, turned sideways and passed out of the restricted view.
     "what does that prove?" said blackberry, his teeth chattering. "he may have
flown off the surface or put his great webbed feet down. it's not he that's soaked
through and shivering and twice as heavy with wet fur."
     kehaar reappeared on the parapet above.
     "you go now," he said shortly.
     still the wretched hazel hung back. his leg had begun to hurt again. the sight
of bigwig -- bigwig of all rabbits -- at the end of his tether, half unconscious,
playing no part in this desperate exploit, lowered his courage still more. he knew
that he had not got it in him to jump into the water. the horrible situation was
beyond him. he stumbled on the slippery planking and, as he sat up, found fiver
beside him.
     "i'll go, hazel," said fiver quietly. "i think it'll be all right."
     he put his front paws on the edge of the bow. then, on the instant, all the
rabbits froze mot

speedwell followed, but as fiver was about to go silver stopped him.
     "if all our bucks go, hazel," he said, "the does will be left alone and i don't
think they'll manage it."
     "they'll obey thlayli, sir," said blackavar, before hazel could reply. "i think
he's the one to get them started."
     bigwig was still lying in the bilgewater, in the place he had taken up when they
came to the first bridge. he seemed to be asleep, but when silver nuzzled him he
raised his head and looked about in a dazed manner.

     "oh, hello, silver," he said. "i'm afraid this shoulder of mine's going to be a
bother. i feel awfully cold, too. where's hazel?"
     silver explained. bigwig got up with difficulty and they saw that he was still
bleeding. he limped to the thwart and climbed on it.
     "hyzenthlay,"

 he said, "your friends can't be any wetter, so we'll get them to
jump in now. one by one, don't you think? then there'll be no risk of them
scratching or hurting each other as they swim."
     in spite of what blackavar had said, it was a long time before everyone had left
the boat. there were in fact ten does altogether -- though none of the rabbits
knew the number -- and although one or two responded to bigwig's patient
urging, several were so much exhausted that they remained huddled where they
were, or looked stupidly at the water until others were brought to take their place.
from time to time bigwig would ask one of the bucks to give a lead and in this
way acorn, hawkbit and bluebell all scrambled over the side. the injured doe,
thrayonlosa, was clearly in a bad way and blackberry and thethuthinnang swam
through together, one in front of her and one behind.
     as darkness closed in, the rain st

opped. hazel and blackavar went back to the
bank of the pool below the bridge. the sky cleared and the oppression lifted as
the thunder moved away eastward. but it was fu inlé before bigwig himself came
through the bridge with silver and fiver. it was as much as ever he could do to
keep afloat, and when he reached the grating he rolled over in the water, belly
uppermost, like a dying fish. he drifted into the shallows and, with silver's help,
pulled himself out. hazel and several of the others were waiting for him, but he
cut them short with a flash of his old bullying manner. "come on, get out of the
way," he said. "i'm going to sleep now, hazel, and frith help you if you say i'm

 to find thrayonlosa gone and, searching, had found her in a clump of
reeds downstream. evidently the poor creature had felt that she was going to die
and, in the manner of animals, had slipped away.
     the news depressed hazel. he knew that they had been lucky to get so many
does out of efrafa and to escape from woundwort without having to stand and
fight. the plan had been a good one, but the storm and the frightening efficiency
of the efrafans had nearly defeated it. for all the courage of bigwig and of silver,
they would have failed without kehaar. now kehaar was going to leave them,
bigwig was wounded, and his own leg was none too good. with the does to look
after, they would not be able to travel in the open as fast or as easily as they had
on the way down from watership. he would have liked to stay where they were
for a few days, so that bigwig could recover his strength and the does find their
feet and get used to life outside a warren. but the place, he realized, was
hopelessly in

undings.
     he consulted blackberry, who pointed out that probably it would not be long
before men found the boat; then very likely several would be close by for some
time. this decided hazel that they had better set out at once and try to reach
somewhere where they could rest more easily. he could hear and smell that the
swamp extended a long way downstream. with the road lying to the south, the
only way seemed to be northward, over the bridge, which was in any case the way
home.
     taking bigwig with him, he climbed the bank to the grass track. the first thing
they saw was kehaar, picking slugs out of a clump of hemlock near the bridge.
they came up to him without speaking and began to nibble the short grass
nearby.
     after a little while kehaar said, "now you getting mudders, meester 'azel. all
go fine, eh?"
     "yes. we'd never have done it without you, kehaar. i hear you turned up just in
time to save bigwig last night."
     "dis bad rabbit, pig fella, 'e go fight me. plenty cl

arren, kehaar, if we can get there."
     "ees finish here now for me. i go to peeg vater."
     "shall we see you again, kehaar?"

     "you go back hills? stay dere?"
     "yes, we mean to get there. it's going to be hard going with so many rabbits,
and there'll be efrafan patrols to dodge, i expect."
     "you get dere, later on ees vinter, plenty cold, plenty storm on peeg vater.
plenty bird come in. den i come back, see you vere you live."
     "don't forget, then, kehaar, will you?" said bigwig. "we shall be looking out for
you. come down suddenly, like you did last night."
     "ya, ya, frighten all mudders und liddle rabbits, all liddle pigvigs run avay."
     kehaar arched his wings and rose into the air. he flew over the parapet of the
bridge and upstream. then he turned in a circle to the left, came back over the
grass track and flew straight down it, skimming just over the rabbits' heads. he
gave one of his raucous cries and was gone to the southward. they gazed after
him as he

disappeared above the trees.
     "oh, fly away, great bird so white," said bigwig. "you know, he made me feel i
could fly, too. that big water! i wish i could see it."
     as they continued to look in the direction where kehaar had gone, hazel
noticed for the first time a cottage at the far end of the track, where the grass
sloped up to join the road. a man, taking care to keep still, was leaning over the
hedge and watching them intently. hazel stamped and bolted into the
undergrowth of the swamp, with bigwig hard on his heels.
     "you know what he's thinking about?" said
 
 ___________________________
 
 bigwig. "he's thinking about the
vegetables in his garden."
     "i know," replied hazel. "and we shan't be able to keep this lot away from
them once they get the idea into their heads. the quicker we push on the better."
     shortly afterward the rabbits set out across the park to the north. bigwig soon
found that he was not up to a long journey. his wound was painful and the
shoulder muscle would not stand hard use. hazel was still lame and the does,
though willing and obedient, showed that they knew little about the life of hlessil.
it was a trying time.
     in the days that followed -- days of clear sky and fine weather -- blackavar
proved his worth again and again, until hazel came to rely on him as much as on
any of his veterans. there was a great deal more to him than anyone could

have
guessed. when bigwig had determined not to come out of efrafa without
blackavar, he had been moved entirely by pity for a miserable, helpless victim of
woundwort's ruthlessness. it turned out, however, that blackavar, when not
crushed by humiliation and ill-treatment, was a good cut above the ordinary. his
story was an unusual one. his mother had not been born an efrafan. she had
been one of the rabbits taken prisoner when woundwort attacked the warren at
nutley copse. she had mated with an efrafan captain and had

m. while still full of his wrongs he
had met hyzenthlay and made himself a secret friend and adviser of the
discontented does in the right fore. he had begun by urging them to try to get
the council's consent to their leaving efrafa. if they had succeeded they would
have asked for him to be allowed to go with them. but when the does' deputation
to the council failed, blackavar turned to the idea of escape. at first he had meant
to take the does with him, but his nerve, strained to the limit, as bigwig's had
been, by the dangers and uncertainties of conspiracy, had given way and in the
end he had simply made a dash on his own, to be caught by campion. under the
punishment inflicted by the council his mercurial spirit had fallen low and he had
become the apathetic wretch the sight of whom had so much shocked bigwig. yet
at the whispered message in the hraka pit this spirit had flickered up again where
another's might well have failed to do so, and he had been ready to set all on the
hazard and

 have another shot. now, free among these easy-going strangers, he
saw himself as a trained efrafan using his skill to help them in their need.
although he did all that he was told, he did not hesitate to make suggestions as
well, particularly when it came to reconnoitering and looking for signs of danger.
hazel, who was ready to accept advice from anybody when he thought it was
good, listened to most of what he said and was content to leave it to bigwig -- for
whom, naturally, blackavar entertained a tremendous respect -- to see that he did
not overreach himself in his warm-hearted, rather candid zeal.
     after two or three days of slow, careful journeying, with many halts in cover,
they found themselves, late one afternoon, once more in sight of caesar's belt,
but further west than before, close to a little copse at the top of some rising
ground. everyone was tired and when they had fed -- "evening silflay every day,
just as you promised,"

said hyzenthlay to bigwig -- bluebell and speedwell
suggested that it might be worthwhile to dig some scrapes in the light soil under
the trees and live there for a day or two. hazel felt willing enough, but fiver
needed persuasion.
     "i know we can do with a rest, but somehow i don't altogether like it, hazel-
rah," he said. "i suppose i've got to try to think why?"
     "not on my account," answered hazel. "but i doubt you'll shift the others this
time. one or two of these does are 'ready for mudder,' as kehaar wou

 be right," said fiver. "that vilthuril's a beautiful doe. i'd like a
chance to get to know her better. after all, it's not natural to rabbits, is it? -- on
and on day after day."
     later, however, when blackavar returned with dandelion from a patrol they
had undertaken on their own initiative, he came out more strongly against the
idea.
     "this is no place to stop, hazel-rah," he said. "no wide patrol would bivouac
here. it's fox country. we ought to try to get further before dark."
     bigwig's shoulder had been hurting him a good deal during the afternoon and
he felt low and surly. it seemed to him that blackavar was being clever at other

people's expense. if he got his way they would have to go on, tired as they were,
until they came to somewhere which was suitable by efrafan standards. there
they would be as safe -- no more and no less -- than they would have been if they
had stayed at this copse; but blackavar would be the clever fellow who had saved
them from a fox that had n

ever existed outside his own fancy. his efrafan
scoutcraft act was getting to be a bore. it was time someone called his bluff.
     "there are likely to be foxes anywhere about the downs," said bigwig sharply.
"why is this fox country more than anywhere else?"
     tact was a quality which blackavar valued about as much as bigwig did; and
now he made the worst possible reply.
     "i can't exactly tell you why," he said. "i've formed a strong impression, but it's
hard to explain quite what it's based on."
     "oh, an impression, eh?" sneered bigwig. "did you see any hraka? pick up any
scent? or was it just a message from little green mice singing under a toadstool?"
     blackavar felt hurt. bigwig was the last rabbit he wanted to quarrel with.
     "ye think i'm a fool, then," he answered, his efrafan accent becoming

more
marked. "no, there was neether hraka ner scent, but i still think that this is a
place where a fox comes. on these patrols we used to do, ye know, we--"
     "did you see or smell anything?" said bigwig to dandelion.
     "er -- well, i'm not really quite sure," said dandelion. "i mean, blackavar
seems to know an awful lot about patrolling and he asked me whether i didn't feel
a sort of--"
     "well, we can go on like this all night," said bigwig. "blackavar, do you know
that earlier this summer, before we had the benefit of your experience, we went
for days across every kind of country -- fields, heather, woods, downs -- and never
lost one rabbit?"
     "it's the idea of scrapes, that's all," said blackavar apologetically, "new scrapes
get noticed; and digging can be heard a surprisingly long way, ye know."
     "let him alone," said hazel, before bigwig could speak again. "you didn't get
him out of efrafa to bully him. look, blackavar

t we're at risk
all the time until we get back to our warren and everyone's so tired that i think we
might just as well stop here for a day or two. we shall be all the better for it."
     enough scrapes were finished by soon after sunset and next day, sure enough,
all the rabbits felt a great deal better for a night underground. as hazel had
foreseen, there was some mating and a scuffle or two, but no one was hurt. by the
evening a kind of holiday spirit prevailed. hazel's leg was stronger and bigwig felt
fitter than at any time since he went into efrafa. the does, harassed and bony two
days before, were beginning to look quite sleek.
     on the second morning, silflay did not begin until some time after dawn. a
light wind was blowing straight into the north bank of the copse, where the
scrapes had been dug, and bluebell, when he came up, swore he could smell
rabbits on it.
     "it's old holly pressing his chin glands for us, hazel-rah," he said. "a rabbit's
sneeze on the morning breeze s

ngs happen. but look, i tell you what. unless there are two
hombil, which would be very bad luck, we've got till ni-frith at least to get away.
that homba won't be hunting any more for some time. i suggest we all move on
as soon as we can."
     with a word of agreement, hazel went out to call the rabbits together. they
made a scattered but swift run to the northeast, along the edge of a field of
ripening wheat. no one spoke of the doe. they had covered more than three
quarters of a mile before bigwig and hazel halted to rest and to make sure that no
one had fallen behind. blackavar came up with hyzenthlay, bigwig said,
     "you told us how it would be, didn't you? and i was the one who wouldn't
listen."
     "told you?" said blackavar. "i don't understand."
     "that there was likely to be a fox."
     "i don't remember, i'm afraid. but i don't see that any of us could possibly
have known. anyway, what's a doe more or less?"
     bigwig looked at him in astonishment, but blackavar, appare

ntly unconcerned
either to stress what he had said or to break off the talk, simply began to nibble
the grass. bigwig, puzzled moved away and himself began to feed a little distance
off, with hyzenthlay and hazel.
     "what's he getting at?" he asked after a while. "you were all there when he
warned us, two nights ago, that there was likely to be a fox. i treated him badly."
     "in efrafa," said hyzenthlay, "if a rabbit gave advice and the advice wasn't
accepted, he immediately forgot it and so did everyone else. blackavar thought
what hazel decided; and whether it turned out later to be right or wrong was

all
the same. his own advice had never been given."
     "i can believe that," said bigwig. "efrafa! ants led by a dog! but we're not in
efrafa now. has he really forgotten that he warned us?"
     "probably he really has. but whether or not, you'd never get him to admit that
he warned you or to listen while you told him he'd been right. he could no more
do that than pass hraka underground."
     "but you're an efrafan. do you think like that, too?"

     "i'm a doe," said hyzenthlay.

          -<*>-

     during the early afternoon they began to approach the belt and bigwig was th

lized how likely it was that--"
     "look here," said hazel, "you know very well what we owe to you. the does all
think el-ahrairah sent you to get them out of efrafa. they believe no one else
could have done it. as for what happened this morning, it was my fault as much
as yours. but i never supposed we would get home without losing some rabbits.
in fact we've lost two and that's better than i expected. we can get back to the
honeycomb tonight if we press on. let's forget about the homba now, bigwig -- it
can't be altered -- and try to -- hello, who's this?"
     they were coming to a thicket of juniper and dog roses, tangled at ground level
with nettles and trails of bryony on which the berries were now beginning to
ripen and turn red. as they stopped to pick a line into the undergrowth, four big
rabbits appeared out of the long grass and sat looking down at them. one of the
does, coming up the slope a little way behind, stamped and turned to bolt. they
heard blackavar check her sharply.

 came up to
hazel.
     "i've sent for the white bird, hazel," he said quietly.
     as a piece of bluff it was effective. they saw campion look upward nervously
and another of the patrol glanced back to the cover of the bushes.
     "what you're saying is stupid," said hazel to campion. "there are a lot of us
here and unless you've got more rabbits than i can see, we're too many for you."
     campion hesitated. the truth was that for once in his life he had acted rashly.
he had seen hazel and bigwig approaching, with blackavar and one doe behind
them. in his eagerness to have something really worthwhile to show on his return
to the council, he had jumped to the conclusion that they were alone. the
efrafans usually kept fairly close together in the open and it had not occurred to

campion that other rabbits might straggle more widely. he had seen a golden
opportunity to attack -- perhaps kill -- the detestable thlayli and blackavar,
together with their one companion -- who seemed to be lam

 said hazel at length. "if you try to interfere
with us it will be the worse for you. silver and blackberry, take the does and go
on. the rest of us will join you."
     "hazel-rah," whispered blackavar, "the patrol must be killed -- all of them.
they mustn't report back to the general."
     this had also occurred to hazel. but as he thought of the dreadful fight and the
four efrafans actually torn to pieces -- for that was what it would mean -- he
could not find it in his heart to do it. like bigwig, he felt a reluctant liking for
campion. besides, it would take some doing. quite probably some of his own
rabbits would be killed -- certainly wounded. they would not reach the
honeycomb that night and they would leave a fresh blood trail wherever they
went. apart from his dislike of the whole idea, there were disadvantages that
might be fatal.
     "no, we'll let them alone," he replied firmly.
     blackavar was silent and they sat watching campion as the last of the does
disappeared through

     "splendid," said hazel. "she'll be the first. my goodness, we've had a time, i
can tell you. and so i will -- what a story! -- but it must wait a bit. come on -- let's
go and bring the others in."
     by sunset the whole party -- twenty rabbits all told -- had made their way up
the length of the beech hanger and reached the warren. they fed among the dew
and the long shadows, with twilight already fallen in the fields below. then they
crowded down into the honeycomb to hear hazel and bigwig tell the story of
their adventures to those who had waited so eagerly and so long to hear it.
     as the last rabbits disappeared underground the wide patrol, which had
followed them from caesar's belt with superlative skill and discipline, veered
away in a half-circle to the east and then turned for efrafa. campion was expert at
finding a night's refuge in the open. he planned to rest until dawn and then cover
the three miles back by evening of the following day.

underground, play bob-stones and hear a few stories from time to time."
     "what about a story now?" said bluebell. "come on, dandelion. 'how i nearly

     "oh, you mean 'woundwort dismayed,'" said dandelion. "that's bigwig's story

d to say, hazel, about the newborn rabbits, when they're ready to come

     hazel, however, had remained where he was, looking intently at the mouse.
     "wait a moment, bigwig," he said. "what did you say, mouse, about another
warren? where is there going to be another warren?"
     the mouse was surprised. "you not a know? not a your friends?"
     "i don't know until you tell me. what did you mean about new rabbits and
another warren soon?" his tone was urgent and inquisitive.
     the mouse became nervous and, after the manner of his kind, began to say
what he thought the rabbits would like to hear.
     "maybe is a no warren. is a plenty good a rabbits 'ere, is a

twittered the mouse.
     hazel considered this lot briefly, but it beat him.
     "oh, come on, hazel," said bigwig. "let the poor little beast alone. i want to
talk to you."
     hazel ignored him. going close to the mouse, he bent his head and spoke
quietly and firmly.
     "you've often said you're our friend," he said. "if you are, tell me, and don't be
afraid, what you know about other rabbits coming."
     the mouse looked confused. then he said, "i not see other rabbits, sir, but a

     "'e say is a come just a now on a morning side. i not a see."
     "good fellow," said hazel. "that's very helpful." he turned back to the others.
"what d'you make of this, bigwig?" he asked.
     "not much," answered bigwig. "long-grass rumors. these little creatures say
anything and change it five times a day. ask him again fu inlé -- he'll tell you

     "if you're right, then i'm wrong and we can all forget it," said hazel. "but i'm

i've got no speed with this leg."

 squatted in front of hazel and looked round him in silence, to
make sure of his effect.
     "you've finished the hole?" asked hazel.
     "never mind the hole," answered speedwell. "i didn't come up to say that.
clover's had her litter. all good, healthy kittens. three bucks and three does, she
says."
     "you'd better go up in the beech tree and sing that," said hazel. "see that
everybody knows! but tell them not to go crowding down disturbing her."
     "i shouldn't think they would," said bigwig. "who'd be a kitten again, or even
want to see one -- blind and deaf and no fur?"
     "some of the does may want to see them," said hazel. "they're excited, you
know. but we don't want clover disturbed into eating them or anything miserable
like that."
     "it looks as though we really are going to live a natural life again at last, doesn't
it?" said bigwig, as they browsed their way along the bank. "what a summer it's
been! i keep dreaming i'm back in efrafa, you know; but it'll pass off, i

suppose.
one thing i brought back out of that place, though, and that's the value of keeping
a warren hidden. as we get bigger, hazel, we ought to take care of that. we'll do
better than efrafa, though. when we've reached the right size, rabbits can be
encouraged to leave."
     "well, don't you leave," said hazel, "or i'll tell kehaar to bring you back by the
scruff of the neck. i'm relying on you to produce us a really good owsla."
     "it's certainly something to look forward to," said bigwig. "take a pack of
young fellows across to the farm and chase the cats out of the barn to get an
appetite. well, it'll come. i say, this grass is as dry as horsehair on barbed wire,
isn't it? what about a run down the hill to the fields -- just you and i and fiver?
corn's been cut, you know, and there should be good pickings. i expect they're
going to burn off the field, but they haven't done it yet."
     "no, we must wait a bit," said hazel. "i want to hear what holly and blackavar
have to say

when they come in."
     "that needn't keep you long," replied bigwig. "here they come already, unless
i'm much mistaken. straight down the open track, too! not bothered about
keeping hidden, are they? what a rate they're going!"

     "there's something wrong," said hazel, staring at the approaching rabbits.
     holly and blackavar reached the long shadow of the wood at top speed, as
though they were being pursued. the watchers expected them to slow down as
they came to the bank, but they kept straight on and appeared actually to be
going to run underground. a

cause he'd had no
orders. but how long will it take them to get here?"
     blackavar had returned from underground, bringing silver and blackberry.
     "we ought to leave at once, sir," he said to hazel. "we might be able to get
quite a long way before they come."
     hazel looked about him. "anyone who wants to go can go," he said. "i shan't.
we made this warren ourselves and frith only knows what we've been through on
account of it. i'm not going to leave it now."
     "neither am i," said bigwig. "if i'm for the black rabbit, there's one or two
from efrafa will come with me."
     there was a short silence.
     "holly's right to want to stop the holes," went on hazel. "it's the best thing to
do. we fill the holes in, good and thorough. then they have to dig us out. the
warren's deep. it's under a bank, with tree roots all through it and over the top.
how long can all those rabbits stay on the down without attracting elil? they'll
have to give it up."
     "you don't know these efrafan

nd took no more until it
was ready to hunt again. but the efrafans were accustomed to a death here and
there. unless general woundwort himself were killed, they would stay until the
job was done. nothing would stop them, short of some unexpected catastrophe.
     but suppose that he himself were to go and talk to woundwort? might there
not just possibly be a chance of getting him to see sense? whatever had happened
at nutley copse, the efrafans could not fight to the finish against rabbits like
bigwig, holly and silver without losing lives -- probably a good many lives.
woundwort must know this. perhaps it might not be too late, even now, to
persuade him to agree to a new plan -- a plan that would be as good for one
warren as the other.
     "and perhaps it might be," thought hazel grimly. "but it's a possible chance
and so i'm afraid the chief rabbit has got to take it. and since this savage brute is
probably not to be trusted, i suppose the chief rabbit must go alone."
     he returned to

the honeycomb and found bigwig.
     "i'm off to talk to general woundwort, if i can get hold of him," he said.
"you're chief rabbit until i come back. keep them at it."
     "but, hazel," said bigwig, "wait a moment. it's not safe--"
     "i shan't be long," said hazel. "i'm just going to ask him what he's up to."
     a moment later he was down the bank and limping up the track, pausing from
time to time to sit up and look about him for an efrafan patrol.

can do anything to stop them."
     hazel could feel him trembling as he spoke. as the sounds of digging
continued, he sensed fear spreading all through the burrow. "they'll take us back
to efrafa," whispered vilthuril to thethuthinnang. "the warren police--"
     "be quiet," said hyzenthlay. "the bucks aren't talking like that and why should
we? i'd rather be here now, as we are, than never have left efrafa."
     it was bravely said, but hazel was not the only one who could tell her thoughts.
bigwig remembered the night in efrafa when he had calmed her by talking of the
high downs and the certainty of their escape. in the dark, he nuzzled hazel's
shoulder and pressed him over to one side of the wide burrow.
     "listen, hazel," he said, "we're not finished yet. not by a long way. when the
roof breaks, they'll come down into this end of the honeycomb. but we can get
everybody back into the sleeping burrows behind and block the runs that lead to
them. they'll be no better off."
     "well, 
 
 ___________________________
 
if we do that, it'll last a bit longer," said hazel. "but they'll soon be able
to break into the sleeping burrows, once they're in here."
     "they'll find me there when they do," said bigwig, "and one or two more
besides. i shouldn't wonder if they didn't decide to go home."

     with a kind of wry envy, hazel realized that bigwig was actually looking
forward to meeting the efrafan assault. he knew he could fight and he meant to
show it. he was not thinking of anything else. the hopelessness of their chances
had no important place in his thoughts. even the sound of the digging, clearer
already, only set him thinking of the best way to sell his life as dearly as he could.
but what else was there for any of them to do? at least bigwig's preparations
would keep the others busy and perhaps do something to dispel the silent f

ear
that filled all the warren.
     "you're quite right, bigwig," he said. "let's prepare a little reception. will you
tell silver and the others what you want and get them started?"
     as bigwig began to explain his plan to silver and holly, hazel sent speedwell
to the north end of the honeycomb to listen to the digging and keep reporting
what he could make out about its progress. as far as he could see, it would make
little difference whether the roof-fall came there or in the center, but at least he
ought to try to show the others that he was keeping his wits about him.
     "we can't break these walls down to stop the run between, bigwig," said holly.
"they hold the roof up at this 
 
 ___________________________
 
end, you know."
     "i know that," answered bigwig. "we'll dig into the walls of the sleeping
burrows behind. they'll need to be bigger anyway, if we're all going to get in there
together. then kick the loose earth back into the spaces between the columns.
stop the whole thing right up."
     since he had come out of efrafa, bigwig's standing was very high. seeing him
in good heart, the others set aside their fear as best they could and did as he told
them, enlarging the burrows beyond the south end of the honeycomb and piling
up the soft earth in the entry runs until what had been a colonnade began to
become a solid wall. it was during a pause in this work that speedwell reported
that the digging above the north end had stopped. hazel went and crouched
beside him, listening for some time. there was nothing to be heard. h

was a long silence.
     "fiver?" said hazel. "fiver? can you hear me?"
     suddenly a terrible sound broke from fiver; a sound at which every rabbit in
the warren leaped in dreadful fear; a sound that no rabbit had ever made, that no
rabbit had the power to make. it was deep and utterly unnatural. the rabbits
working on the far side of the wall crouched terrified. one of the does began to
squeal.
     "dirty little beasts," yelped fiver. "how -- how dare you? get out -- out! out --
out!"
     bigwig burst through the piled earth, twitching and panting.
     "in the name of frith, stop him!" he gasped. "they'll all go mad!"
     shuddering, hazel clawed at fiver's side.
     "wake! fiver, wake!"
     but fiver was lying in a deep stupor.
     in hazel's mind, green branches were straining in the wind. up and down they
swayed, thresh and ply. there was something -- something he could glimpse
between them. what was it? water he sensed; and fear. then suddenly he saw
clearly, for an instant, a

 little huddle of rabbits on the bank of a stream at dawn,
listening to the sound of yelping in the wood above and the scolding of a jay.
     "if i were you, i shouldn't wait until ni-frith. i should go now. in fact, i think
you'll have to. there's a large dog loose in the wood. there's a large dog loose in
the wood."
     the wind blew, the trees shook their myriads of leaves. the stream was gone.
he was in the honeycomb, facing bigwig in the dark, across the motionless body
of fiver. the scratching from above was louder and closer.
     "bigwig," said hazel, "do as i say at once, there's a good fellow. we've got
hardly any time. go and get dandelion and blackberry and bring them to me at
the foot of kehaar's run, quickly."
     at the foot of the run buckthorn was still in his place. he had not moved at
fiver's cry, but his breath was short and his pulse very quick. he and the other
three rabbits gathered about hazel without

all. but i've no time to explain. every moment counts now. dandelion and

blackberry, you come with me. you're to go straight up out of this run and
through the trees to the down. then northward, over the edge and down to the
fields. don't stop for anything. you'll go faster than i shall. wait for me by the
iron tree at the bottom."
     "but hazel--" said blackberry.
     "as soon as we've gone," said hazel, turning to bigwig, "you're to block this run
and get everyone back behind the wall you've made. if they break in, hold them
up as long as you can. don't give in to them on any account. el-ahrairah has
shown me what to do."
     "but where are you going, hazel?" asked bigwig.
     "to the farm," said hazel, "to gnaw another rope. now, you two, follow me up
the run: and don't forget, you stop for nothing until you're down the hill. if there
are rabbits outside, don't fight -- run."

ed himself on his forelegs.
     on the instant he was knocked sideways and felt himself pressed down. there
was a light but sharp pricking beneath the fur across his back. he lashed out with
his hind legs, but struck nothing. he turned his head. the cat was on him,
crouched half across his body. its whiskers brushed his ear. its great green eyes,
the pupils contracted to vertical black slits in the sunshine, were staring into his
own.
     "can you run?" hissed the cat. "i think not".

in the pit at the top.
     "there's nothing left to dig, sir," he said. "the bottom will fall in if anyone goes
down there now."
     "can you make out what's below?" asked woundwort. "is it a run or a burrow
we shall be into?"

the other side?"
     "yes, sir, just about here," said vervain.
     "we'll get this pile of soft earth down," said woundwort. "put two rabbits on it.
if i'm right and thlayli's on the other side, they'll run into trouble before long.
that's what we want -- to force him to attack them."
     as thunder and thistle began to dig, woundwort crouched silently behind
them, waiting.

          -<*>-

     even before he heard the roof of the honeycomb fall in, bigwig knew that it
could be only a matter of time before the efrafans found the soft places in the
south wall and set to work to break through one of them. that would not take
long. then he would have to fight -- probably with woundwort himself; and if
woundwort closed with him and used his weight, he would have little chance.
somehow he must manage to hurt him at the outset, before he expected it. but
how?
     he put the problem to holly.
     "the trouble is this warren wasn't dug to be defended,"
 
 ___________________________
 
 said holly. "that was
what the slack run was for, back at home, so the threarah once told me. it was
made so that if we ever had to, we could get down beneath an enemy and come up
where he wasn't expecting us."
     "that's it!" cried bigwig. "that's the idea! look, i'm going to dig myself into the
floor of the run just behind this blocked opening. then you cover me with earth.
it won't be noticed -- there's so much digging and mess in the place already. i
know it's a risk, but it'll be better than just trying to stand up in front of a rabbit
like woundwort."
     "but suppose they break through the wall somewhere else?" said holly.
     "you must try to make them do it here," replied bigwig. "when you hear them
on the other side,

where i am. anything to get them interested. come on, help me to dig. and,
silver, get everyone back out of the honeycomb now and close this wall
completely."

     "bigwig," said pipkin, "i can't wake fiver. he's still lying out there in the
middle of the floor. what's to be done?"
     "i'm afraid there's nothing we can do now," replied bigwig. "it's a great pity,
but we'll have to leave him."
     "oh, bigwig," cried pipkin, "let me stay out there with him! you'll never miss
me, and i can go on trying--"
     "hlao-roo," said holly as kindly as he could, "if we lose no one but fiver before
this business is ended, then the lord frith himself will be fighting for us. no, i'm
sorry, old chap, not another word. we need you, we need everyone. silver, see
that he goes back with the others."
     when woundwort dropped through the roof of the honeycomb, bigwig was
already lying under a thin covering of soi

his own claws, too, were bloody and this blood was not his.
     "are you all right, sir?" asked vervain, behind him.
     "of course i'm all right, you fool," said woundwort. "follow me close."
     the other rabbit spoke from in front of him.
     "you told me once to start by impressing you, general. i hope i have."
     "i told you once that i would kill you myself," replied woundwort, "there is no
white bird here, thlayli." he advanced for the second time.
     bigwig's taunt had been deliberate. he hoped that woundwort would fly at
him and so give him a chance to bite him again. but as he waited, pressed to the
ground, he realized that woundwort was too clever to be drawn. always quick to
size up any new situation, he was coming forward slowly, keeping close to the
ground himself. he meant to use his claws. afraid, listening to woundwort's
approach, bigwig could hear the uneven movement of his forepaws, almost
within striking distance. instinctively he drew

 back and as he did so the thought
came with the sound: "the near forepaw's dragging. he can't use it properly."
leaving his right flank exposed, he struck out on his near side.
     his claws found woundwort's leg, ripping sideways; but before he could draw
back, woundwort's whole weight came down on him and the next moment his
teeth had met in his right ear. bigwig squealed, pressed down and thrashing from
side to side. woundwort, feeling his enemy's fear and helplessness, loosed his
hold of the ear and rose above him, ready to bite and tear him across the back of
the neck. for an instant he stood above the helpless bigwig, his shoulders filling
the run. then his injured foreleg gave way and he lurched sideways against the
wall. bigwig cuffed him twice across the face and felt the third blow pass through
his whiskers as he sprang back. the sound of his he

avy breathing came plainly
from the top of the earth pile. bigwig, the blood oozing from his back and ear,
stood his ground and waited. suddenly he realized that he could see the dark
shape of general woundwort faintly outlined where he crouched above him. the
first traces of daylight were glimmering through the broken roof of the
honeycomb behind.

ground. finally, when he was utterly at a loss, it set off over the field of its own
accord, padding easily along beside one of the rows of threshed straw, trailing the
broken cord and pouncing in and out at every squeak and rustle. blackberry,
sheltering behind a parallel row, kept level with it. in this manner they covered
the distance to the pylon line, halfway to the foot of the down. it was here that
dandelion caught up with him.
     "it's not fast enough, blackberry! we must get on. bigwig may be dead."
     "i know, but at least it's going the right way. i couldn't get it to move at all, to
start with. can't we--"
     "it's got to come up the down at speed or there'll be no surprise. come on, we'll
draw it together. we'll have to get ahead of it first, though."
     they ran fast through the stubble until they neared the trees. then they turned
and crossed the dog's line in full view. this time it pursued instantly and the two
rabbits reached the undergrowth at the bottom of th

ten yards to spare. as they began to climb they heard the dog crashing through
the brittle elders. it barked once and then they were out on the open slope with

          -<*>-

     the blood ran over bigwig's neck and down his foreleg. he watched

woundwort steadily where he crouched on the earth pile, expecting him to leap
forward at any moment. he could hear a rabbit moving behind him, but the run
was so narrow that he could not have turned even if it had been safe to do so.
     "everyone all right?" he asked.
     "they're all right," replied holly. "come on, bigwig, let me take your place
now. you need a rest."
     "can't," panted bigwig. "you couldn't get past me here -- no room -- and if

you leave it to me. i know what i'm doing."
     it had occurred to bigwig that in the narrow run even his dead body would be a
considerable obstacle. the efrafans would either have to get it out or dig round it
and this would mean more delay. in the burrow behind him he could hear
bluebell, who was apparently telling the does a story. "good idea," he thought.
"keep 'em happy. more than i could do if i had to sit there."
     "so then el-ahrairah said to the fox, 'fox you may smell and fox you may be,
but i can tell your fortune in the water.'"
     suddenly woundwort
 
 ___________________________
 
 spoke.
     "thlayli," he said, "why do you want to throw your life away? i can send one
fresh rabbit after another into this run if i choose. you're too good to be killed.
come back to efrafa. i promise i'll give you the command of any mark you like. i
give you my word."
     "silflay hraka, u embleer rah," replied bigwig.
     "'ah ha,' said the fox, 'tell my fortune, eh? and what do you see in the water,
my friend? fat rabbits running through the grass, yes, yes?'"
     "very well," said woundwort. "but remember, thlayli, you yourself can stop
this nonsense whenever you wish."
     "'no,' replied el-ahrairah, 'it is not fat rabbits that i see in the water, but swift
hounds on the scent and my enemy flying for his life.'"
     bigwig realized that woundwort also knew that in the run his body would be
nearly as 
 
 ___________________________
 
great a hindrance dead as alive. "he wants me to come out on my feet,"
he thought. "but it's inlé, not efrafa, that i shall go to from here."
     suddenly woundwort leaped forward in a single bound and landed full against
bigwig like a branch falling from a tree. he made no attempt to use his claws. his
great weight was pushing, chest to chest, against bigwig's. with heads side by side
they bit and snapped at each other's shoulders. bigwig felt himself sliding slowly
backward. he could not resist the tremendous pressure. his back legs, with claws
extended, furrowed the floor of the run as he gave ground. in a few moments he
would be pushed bodily into the burrow behind. putting his last strength into the
effort to remain where he was, he loosed his teeth from woundwort's shoulder
and dropped his head, like a cart horse straining at a load. still he was slipping.
then, very gradually it seemed, the terrible pressure began to slack

en. his claws
had a hold of the ground. woundwort, teeth sunk in his back, was snuffling and
choking. though bigwig did not know it, his earlier blows had torn woundwort
across the nose. his nostrils were full of his own blood, and with jaws closed in
bigwig's fur he could not draw his breath. a moment more and he let go his hold.
bigwig, utterly exhausted, lay where he was. after a few moments he tried to get
up, but a faintness came over him and a feeling of turning over and over in a ditch

of leaves. he closed his eyes. there was silence and then, quite clearly, he heard
fiver speaking in the long grass. "you are closer to death than i. you are closer to
death than i."
     "the wire!" squealed bigwig. he jerked himself up and opened his eyes. the
run was empty. general woundwort was gone.

d each other in the dim light. then, very quietly and with no trace of fear, the
strange rabbit said,
     "i am sorry for you with all my heart. but you cannot blame us, for you came to
kill us if you could."
     "blame you?" answered vervain. "blame you for what?"
     "for your death. believe me, i am sorry for your death."
     vervain in his time had encountered any number of prisoners who, before they
died, had cursed or threatened him, not uncommonly with supernatural
vengeance, much as bigwig had cursed woundwort in the storm. if such things
had been liable to have any effect on him, he would not have been head of the
owslafa. indeed, for almost any utterance that a rabbit in this dreadful situation
could find to make, vervain was unthinkingly ready with one or other of a stock
of jeering rejoinders. now, as he continued to meet the eyes of this unaccountable
enemy -- the only one he had faced in all the long night's search for bloodshed --
horror came upon him and he was filled wit

s had the presence of mind to dart
down the opened run when the dog came. back in the honeycomb, groundsel
immediately surrendered himself and his fugitives to fiver, who was still
bemused from his long trance, and scarcely restored to his senses sufficiently to
grasp what was toward. at length, however, after the five efrafans had remained
crouching for some time in the burrow, listening to the sounds of the dog hunting
above, fiver recovered himself, made his way to the mouth of the run where
bigwig still lay half conscious, and succeeded in making holly and silver
understand that the siege was ended. there was no lack of helpers to tear open
the blocked gaps in the south wall. it so happened that bluebell was the first
through into the honeycomb; and for many days afterward he was still improving
upon his imitation of captain fiver at the head of his crowd of efrafan prisoners
-- "like a tomtit rounding up a bunch of molting jackdaws," as he put it.

     no one was inclined to pay them

much attention at the time, however, for the
only thoughts throughout the warren were for hazel and bigwig. bigwig seemed
likely to die. bleeding in half a dozen places, he lay with closed eyes in the run he
had defended and made no reply when hyzenthlay told him that the efrafans
were defeated and the warren was saved. after a time, they dug carefully to
broaden the run and as the day wore on the does, each in turn, remained beside
him, licking his wounds and listening to his low, unsteady breathing.
     before this, blackberry and dandelion had burrowed their way in from
kehaar's run -- it had not been b

nly a short distance when fiver, sitting up on an anthill to
look about, saw a rabbit approaching over the high ground to the west. they both
ran nearer and recognized hazel. fiver went to meet him while pipkin raced back
to the honeycomb with the news.
     as soon as he had learned all that had happened -- including what groundsel
had to tell -- hazel asked holly to take two or three rabbits and find out for
certain whether the efrafans had really gone. then he himself went into the run
where bigwig was lying. hyzenthlay looked up as he came.
     "he was awake a little while ago, hazel-rah," she said. "he asked where you
were; and then he said his ear hurt very much."
     hazel nuzzled the matted fur cap. the blood had turned hard and set into
pointed spikes that pricked his nose.
     "you've done it, bigwig," he said. "they've all run away."
     for several moments bigwig did not move. then he opened his eyes and raised
his head, pouching out his cheeks and sniffing at the two rabbits

 beside him. he
said nothing and hazel wondered whether he had understood. at last he
whispered, "ees finish meester voundvort, ya?"
     "ya," replied hazel. "i've come to help you to silflay. it'll do you good and we
can clean you up a lot better outside. come on: it's a lovely afternoon, all sun and
leaves."
     bigwig got up and tottered forward into the devastated honeycomb. there he
sank down, rested, got up again and reached the foot of kehaar's run.
     "i thought he'd killed me," he said. "no more fighting for me -- i've had
enough. and you -- your plan worked, hazel-rah, did it? well done. tell me what
it was. and how did you get back from the farm?"
     "a man brought me in a hrududu," said hazel, "nearly all the way."
     "and you flew the rest, i suppose," said bigwig, "burning a white stick in y

mouth? come on, tell me sensibly. what's the matter, hyzenthlay?"
     "oh!" said hyzenthlay, staring. "oh!"
     "what is it?"
     "he did!"
     "did what?"
     "he did ride home in a hrududu. and i saw him as he came -- that night in
efrafa, when i was with you in your burrow. do you remember?"

     "i remember," said bigwig. "i remember what i said, too. i said you'd better tell
it to fiver. that's a good idea -- let's go and do it. and if he'll believe you, hazel-
rah, then i will."

     professing myself, moreover, convinced that the general's unjust interference,
so far from being really injurious to their felicity, was perhaps rather conducive to
it, by improving their knowledge of each other, and adding strength to their
attachment, i leave it to be settled by whomsoever it may concern....

ge, fiver had spent much time alone and even in the
honeycomb, or at morning and evening silflay, was often silent and preoccupied.
no one resented this -- "he looks right through you in such a nice, friendly way,"
as bluebell put it -- for each in his own manner recognized that fiver was now
more than ever governed, whether he would or no, by the pulse of that mysterious
world of which he had once spoken to hazel during the late june days they had
spent together at the foot of the down. it was bigwig who said -- one evening
when fiver was absent from the honeycomb at story time -- that fiver was one
who had paid more dearly than even himself for the night's victory over the
efrafans. yet to his doe, vilthuril, fiver was devotedly attached, while she had
come to understand him almost as deeply as ever hazel had.
     just outside the beech hanger, hyzenthlay's litter of four young rabbits were
playing in the grass. they had first been brought up to graze about seven days
before. if hyzenthla

 to her to breed at any time, for all i know. but i'm sure that hyzenthlay
and vilthuril started their litters in the high summer because they'd had no
natural life in efrafa. for all that, they're the only two who have had litters, as
yet."
     "frith never meant us to go out fighting in the high summer, either, if that
comes to that," said silver. "everything that's happened is unnatural -- the
fighting, the breeding -- and all on account of woundwort. if he wasn't unnatural,
who was?"
     "bigwig was right when he said he wasn't like a rabbit at all," said holly. "he
was a fighting animal -- fierce as a rat or a dog. he fought because he actually felt
safer fighting than running. he was brave, all right. but it wasn't natural; and
that's why it was bound to finish him in the end. he was trying to do something

that frith never meant any rabbit to do. i believe he'd have hunted like the elil if
he could."
     "he isn't dead, you know," broke in groundsel.
     the others were silent.

     "by frith in the leaves, and i know someone who'll be glad to see him!" said
silver. "someone not so very far away."
     they had reached the eastern end of the trees and here, well out in the open
where it was still sunny, a little group of three young rabbits -- bigger than
hyzenthlay's -- were squatting in the long grass, listening to a hulking veteran,
lop-eared and scarred from nose to haunch -- none other than bigwig, captain of
a very free-and-easy owsla. these were the bucks of clover's litter and a likely lot
they looked.
     "oh, no, no, no, no," bigwig was saying. "oh, my wings and beak, that won't
do! you -- what's your name -- scabious -- look, i'm a cat and i see you down at
the bottom of my garden chewing up the lettuces. now, what do i do? do i come
walking up the middle of the path waving my tail? well, do i?"
     "please, sir, i've never seen a cat," said the young rabbit.
     "no, you haven'

     "ah ha, ah ha, o hazel-rah," said bluebell. "the burrow's snug, it hath been
dug, t'is free from beetle, worm and slug. and in the snow, when down we go--"
     "then what a lot to you we'll owe," said hazel. "i mean it, too. the holes are
concealed, are they?"
     "just like efrafa, i should think," said bluebell. "as a matter of fact, i brought
one up with me to show you. you can't see it, can you? no -- well, there you are. i
say, just look at old bigwig with those youngsters over there. you know, if he went
back to efrafa now they couldn't decide which mark to put him in, could they?
he's got them all."
     "come over to the evening side of the wood with us, hazel-rah?" said pipkin.
"we came up early on purpose to have a bit of sunshine before it gets dark."
     "all right," answered hazel good-naturedly. "we've just come back from there,
silver and i, but i don't mind slipping over again for a bit."
     "let's go out to that little hollow
