sportsman, wrote me a letter asking if i could get him a pass to get by the concierge so he could come up and see me
occasionally in the evenings.

i went up to the flat wondering what brett had done to the concierge. the wire was a cable from bill gorton,

said the states were wonderful. new york was wonderful. there had been a grand theatrical season and a whole
crop of great young light heavyweights. any one of them was a good prospect to grow up, put on weight and trim

"good. come on and eat with us, and we'll all go to meet him."
"must clean myself."
"oh, rot! come on."
"must bathe. he doesn't get in till nine."
"come and have a drink, then, before you bathe."
"might do that. now you're not talking rot."
we got in the taxi. the driver looked around.
