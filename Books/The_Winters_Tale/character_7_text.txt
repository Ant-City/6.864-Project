when daffodils begin to peer,--
  with, hey! the doxy over the dale,--
why, then comes in the sweet o' the year:
  for the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.

the white sheet bleaching on the hedge,--
  with, hey! the sweet birds, o, how they sing!--
doth set my pugging tooth on edge;
  for a quart of ale is a dish for a king.

the lark, that tirra-lirra chants,--
  with, hey! with, hey! the thrush and the jay,--
are summer songs for me and my aunts,

i have serv'd prince florizel, and in my time wore three-pile;
but now i am out of service:

but shall i go mourn for that, my dear?
  the pale moon shines by night:
and when i wander here and there,
  i then do most go right.

if tinkers may have leave to live,
  and bear the sow-skin budget,
then my account i well may give
  and in the stocks avouch it.

my traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to lesser linen.
my father named me autolycus; who being, i as am, littered under
mercury, was likewise a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. with
die and drab i purchased this caparison; and my revenue is the
silly-cheat: gallows and knock are too powerful on the highway;
beating and hanging are terrors to me; for the life to come, i
sleep out the thought of it.--a prize! a prize!

i cannot do't without counters.--let me see; what am i to
buy for our sheep-shearing feast? 'three pound of sugar; five
pound of currants; rice'--what will this sister of mine do with
rice? but my father hath made her mistress of the feast, and she
lays it on. she hath made me four and twenty nosegays for the
shearers,--three-man song-men all, and very good ones; but they
are most of them means and bases; but one puritan amongst

the warden pies; 'mace--dates',--none, that's out of my note;

'four pound of prunes, and as many of raisins o' the sun.'

alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay on thee,
rather than have these off.

autolycus.
o sir, the loathsomeness of them offend me more than the stripes
i have received, which are mighty ones and millions.

clown.
alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a great matter.

autolycus.
i am robb'd, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel ta'en from me,

autolycus.
a footman, sweet sir, a footman.

clown.
indeed, he should be a footman, by the garments he has left
with thee: if this be a horseman's coat, it hath seen very hot
service. lend me thy hand, i'll help thee: come, lend me thy
hand.

softly, dear sir! [picks his pocket.] good sir, softly; you ha'
done me a charitable office.

clown.
dost lack any money? i have a little money for thee.

autolycus.
no, good sweet sir; no, i beseech you, sir: i have a kinsman not
past three quarters of a mile hence, unto whom i was going; i
shall there have money or anything i want: offer me no money, i
pray you; t

clown.
what manner of fellow was he that robbed you?

autolycus.
a fellow, sir, that i have known to go about with troll-my-dames;
i knew him once a servant of the prince; i cannot tell, good sir,
for which of his virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out
of the court.

clown.
his vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped out of the
court: they cherish it, to make it stay there; and yet it will no
more but abide.

autolycus.
vices, i would say, sir. i know this man well: he hath been
since an ape-bearer; then a process-server, a bailiff; then he
compassed a motion of the prodigal son, and married a tinker's
wife within a mile where my land and living lies; and, having
flown over many knavish professions, he settled only in rogue:
some call him autolycus.

clown.
out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts wakes, fairs,
and bear-baitings.

autolycus.
very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue t

clown.
not a more cowardly rogue in all bohemia; if you had but looked
big and spit at him, he'd have run.

autolycus.
i must confess to you, sir, i am no fighter: i am false of heart
that way; and that he knew, i warrant him.

clown.
how do you now?

autolycus.
sweet sir, much better than i was; i can stand and walk: i will
even take my leave of you and pace softly towards my kinsman's.

clown.
shall i bring thee on the way?

autolycus.
no, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.

clown.
then fare thee well: i must go buy spices for our sheep-shearing.

autolycus.
prosper you, sweet sir!

[exit clown.]

your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice. i'll be with
you at your sheep-shearing too. if i make not this cheat bring
out another, and the shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled,
and my name put in the book of virtue!

autolycus.
here's another ballad, of a fish that appeared upon the coast
on wednesday the fourscore of april, forty thousand fathom
above water, and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of
maids: it was thought she was a woman, and was turned into a
cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that loved
her. the ballad is very pitiful, and as true.

autolycus.
this is a merry ballad; but a very pretty one.

mopsa.
let's have some merry ones.

autolycus.
why, this is a passing merry one, and goes to the tune of 'two
maids wooing a man.' there's scarce a maid westward but she sings
it: 'tis in request, i can tell you.

mopsa.
we can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou shalt hear;
'tis in three parts.

dorcas.
we had the tune on't a month ago.

autolycus.
i can bear my part; you must know 'tis my occupation: have at it
with you.

   where it fits not you to know.

   whither?

mopsa.

   thou to me thy secrets tell.

[aside.] what i do next, shall be to tell the king
of this escape, and whither they are bound;
wherein, my hope is, i shall so prevail

i shall re-view sicilia; for whose sight
i have a woman's longing.

a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is necessary for a cut-purse;
a good nose is requisite also, to smell out work for the other
senses. i see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.
what an exchange had this been without boot? what a boot is
here with this exchange? sure, the gods do this year connive
at us, and we may do anything extempore. the prince himself is
about a piece of iniquity,--stealing away from his father

i was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old shepherd
deliver the manner how he found it: whereupon, after a little
amazedness, we were all commanded out of the chamber; only this,
methought i heard the shepherd say he found the child.

i thought she had some great matter there in hand; for she
hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever since the death of
hermione, visited that removed house. shall we thither, and with
our company piece the rejoicing?

first gentleman.
who would be thence that has the benefit of access? every wink
of an eye some new grace will be born: our absence makes us
unthrifty to our knowledge. let's along.

now, had i not the dash of my former life in me, would preferment
drop on my head. i brought the old man and his son aboard the
prince; told him i heard them talk of a fardel and i know not
what; but he at that time over-fond of the shepherd's daughter,--
so he then took her to be,--who began to be much sea-sick, and
himself little better, extremity of weather continuing, this
mystery remained undiscover'd. but 'tis all one to me; for had i
been the finder-out of this secret, it would

shepherd.
come, boy; i am past more children, but thy sons and daughters
will be all gentlemen born.

clown.
you are well met, sir: you denied to fight with me this other
day, because i was no gentleman born. see you these clothes? say
you see them not and think me still no gentleman born: you were
best say these robes are not gentlemen born. give me the lie, do;
and try whether i am not now a gentleman born.

autolycus.
i know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.

clown.
ay, and have been so any time these four hours.

shepherd.
and so have i, boy!

clown.
so you have:--but i was a gentleman born before my father; for
the king's son took me by the hand and called me brother; and
then the two kings called my father brother; and then the prince,
my brother, and the princess, my sister, called my father father;
and so we wept; and there was the first gentleman-like tears that
ever we shed.

ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so preposterous estate as

autolycus.
i humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the faults i have
committed to your worship, and to give me your good report to the
prince my master.

shepherd.
pr'ythee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are gentlemen.

clown.
thou wilt amend thy life?

autolycus.
ay, an it like your good worship.

clown.
give me thy hand: i will swear to the prince thou art as honest
a true fellow as any is in bohemia.

shepherd.
you may say it, but not swear it.

clown.
not swear it, now i am a gentleman? let boors and franklins say
it, i'll swear it.

shepherd.
how if it be false, son?

if it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear it in the

i will prove so, sir, to my power.
