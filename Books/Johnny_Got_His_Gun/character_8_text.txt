it was hot. so hot that he seemed to be burning up inside and out. it was so hot he
couldn't breathe. he could only gasp. far off against the sky there was a foggy line of
mountains and moving straight across the desert was the railroad track dancing and
leaping in the heat. it seemed that he and howie were working on the railroad. that was
funny. oh hell things were getting mixed up again. he'd seen all this before. it was like
going into a new drug store for the first time and sitting down and suddenly feeling that
you've been there many times before and that you've already heard what the clerk is
going to say as soon as he comes up to serve you. he and howie working on the railroad
in the heat? sure. sure. it was all right. things were under control.
he and howie were working there in the

 couldn't ever stop. the fellows didn't laugh and kid as you'd think guys
would either. they didn't say a word. they just worked.
looking at a section gang it always seems as if they are working slow. but you have
to work slow because you never stop and you have just so much strength. you don't stop
because you're afraid. it isn't that you're afraid of the foreman because the foreman never
bothers anybody. it's just that you're afraid for the job and of how much the other guy will
do. so he and howie worked slow and steady trying to keep up with the mexicans.
his head throbbed and he could hear his heart pounding against his ribs and even
down in the calves of his legs he could feel the strong pulse beat and yet he couldn't stop
work even for a minute. his breath came shorter and shorter and it seemed that his lungs
were too small to hold the air he had to get into them if he was going to keep alive. it was
a hundred and twenty-five in the shade and there wasn't any shade and he felt like h

e was
smothering under a white hot blanket and all he could think was i've got to stop i've got
to stop i've got to stop.
they stopped for lunch.
it was their first day on the gang and he and howie naturally thought they would be
supplied with lunch from the hand car. but they weren't. when the foreman saw they had
nothing to eat he said something to a couple of the mexicans. the mexicans came over
and offered them something out of their lunch pails. the mexicans were eating fried egg
sandwiches all crusted over with red pepper. he and howie just grunted no thanks and
flopped on their backs. then they turned over on their stomachs because the sun was so
hot it would have burned out their

eye balls even with the lids closed. the mexicans just
sat and chewed on their fried egg sandwiches and stared at them.
all of a sudden there was the noise of the mexicans getting up so he and howie
rolled over to see what was happening. the whole gang was starting down the tracks on a
slow gallop. the foreman just sat and watched the gang. they asked the foreman what
the idea was and the foreman said the boys were going to take a swim.
the idea of a swim was too much. he and howie jumped up and ran along after
them. the way the foreman spoke they thought they were going just a little piece down
the track. but it turned out they ran two miles before they came to a canal maybe ten feet
wide and mud-colored and beached on both sides with a solid mass of tumbleweeds. the
mexicans started pulling their clothes off. he and howie wondered how they figured to
make it into the water without getting full of thistles. they decided there must be some
path through the weeds or the me

ot and it smelled of alkali but that didn't make any difference. it was like an april
shower. he thought about the y.m.c.a. swimming pool in shale city. he thought my
gosh these guys act as if this was the greatest swimming hole in the world. he thought i'll
bet they were never in a swimming pool in their lives. he was standing there with the
mud of the ditch bottom up above his ankles when the mexicans began climbing out and
putting their clothes on again. the swim was over.
by the time he and howie got back to their clothes they were whiskered with thistles
to the hips. they noticed that the mexicans didn't even bother to pick the thistles out.
some of the mexicans were already starting on the trip back to the hand car so they sort
of brushed the thistles off their legs and leaped into their clothes. then they ran the two
miles back and lunch was over and it was time to go to work again.
as the afternoon wore on he and howie began to stumble at their work and finally to
fall. the foreman

t here in the desert forgetting it all with a bunch of mexicans when he might just as
well be back in the cool shade of shale city enjoying summer vacation and thinking
maybe i'll have a date with diane tonight.
he thought girls are a terrible thing all right. girls are probably all untrue and
faithless and they try to smash a guy but you've just got to expect it from them. you've
had to expect it from them and learn to forgive them because it stood to reason that if you
rushed away like he and howie had and went into the middle of a desert and decided you
would bury yourselves there for the whole three months' summer vacation why nobody
suffered but you. and that left the girl back there in shale city to go out with glen hogan
as much as she wanted to. tugging and stumbling and trying to breathe he suddenly had
an awful feeling come over him. he was asking himself a question. he was saying to
himself joe bonham have you beeen a fool?
somebody hollered out that it was quitting time and thin

gs began to dissolve slowly
in front of his eyes. when he got them back into focus he was lying on his stomach with
his head hanging over the side of the hand car and howie lying beside him. he
remembered looking down at the ground as it ran like water in front of his eyes and
hearing those mexicans singing. they were taking turns pumping away on that hand car
to get them back to the bunkhouse. he just lay there gagging a little and listening to them
sing.
the bunkhouse had a dirt floor. it was a sort of shed with a tin roof. it was so hot
inside that he wanted to reach out with his hands for air to stuff into his lungs. the bunks
were wood one on top of the other
 
 ___________________________
 
. he and howie staggered to a pair of bunks that were
together. they didn't even bother to unroll their bedding. they just flopped on the bunks
and lay there quiet and still. the foreman came up and asked if they wanted him to show
them where they could get dinner. but they didn't pay any attention to him. they just lay
back and closed their eyes.
he had reached a funny state. it was the first time in his life he had ever felt that way.
no one part of his body hurt more than any other part so the pain everywh

e bunkhouse. it was dark and the air was filled with sighs. there was a
smell of smoke in the place. the mexicans had cooked their supper over a fire in the
middle of the floor. there was a hole in the tin roof for the smoke to escape through. he
could see the stars through it flickering like something in a fever dream. he gagged. the
smell of food and smoke in the air. wasn't it just like a mexican to want something piping
hot for supper after spending a whole day in the bottom of hell? it was howie shaking
him. "wake up. it's ten o'clock."
he didn't know whether it was night or whether his eye sockets had just burned out
and he couldn't tell sunlight from dark.
"morning or night?" "night."
"tonight or last night?"
"last night i guess. hey look what i got. they just sent it over from the dispatcher's
office."
howie stuck something in front of his face and turned his pocket flashlight on it.
they had remembered to bring a flashlight even if they had forgotten gloves. it was a
telegram howie

 was showing him. the corners of it were all bloody where howie had
been holding it. it read dear howie why were you so impetuous stop i am miserable
thinking what you have done stop please forgive me and come right back to shale city
stop i hate glen hogan stop love onie.
even in the dimness of the bunkhouse he could see the happiness on howie's face.
so onie hated glen hogan did she? well he knew why and if howie didn't know why
then howie was a fool. onie hated glen hogan because glen had thrown her over for
diane. he thought about this for a little bit and about how much prettier diane was than
onie and about how the whole thing showed what good judgment glen hogan had. then
he saw that howie was waiting for an answer. when he tried to answer he found he could
only whisper.
"why do you have to wake a guy up who needs sleep as bad as i do just to show him
that?" "because i got it all figured out." "uh."
howie began to whisper ve

ry excitedly. "it's just like this. for fellows like you and
me to be out here slaving our best years away on a section gang is just
as if girls nice girls like onie and diane suddenly decided to become
washerwomen."
he didn't say anything. he just lay there and thought about it. he could see the point
all right. the idea of diane being a washerwoman was so awful he just closed his eyes
again. howie was whispering at him.
"of course since onie feels that way i hardly know what to do about the poor kid."
he just lay there with his eyes closed saying nothing.
"it isn't as if i didn't have a reason to go back. it's almost as if it was my duty to."
he just lay there limp. but he was listening to howie very closely.
"the dispatcher says there's a gravel train going through here tonight bound for
shale city."
still he didn't say anything. still he listened.
"it would get us there in an hour."
he
 
 ___________________________
 
 kind of moved his leg to show he was still awake listening.
"that gravel train goes through here in ten minutes."
he jumped off his bunk and in one motion had his bed roll over his shoulders. howie
stared at him in surprise.
"what you doing?"
he gave howie a look to show the whole thing was on howie's shoulders.
"well if you're bound and determined to back out on our agreement i guess there's
nothing i can do to stop you. if we're going to get that gravel train we better be getting
outside."
most of the way riding into shale city he thought about bill harper. he thought to
himself only last night i hit bill harper. he thought to himself bill harper was my best
friend and he was telling me the truth and i hit him for it. he lay back against the gravel
and stared up at the stars. he thought 
 
 ___________________________
 
ght with glen hogan. he knew it was probably true or bill harper
wouldn't have told him. yet he had stood up and he had called bill harper a liar and he
had hit bill harper and knocked him down and then he had walked out of the drug store
alone.
on the way home he had run into diane and glen hogan just getting out of glen's
roadster and going into the elysium theatre. then he knew that bill harper had been telling
him the truth. he knew that diane had been cheating on him.
down the block he met howie. howie had been having trouble with onie over glen
hogan so they both decided to leave it all and go out into the desert and work like men
and forget about it. it wasn't like he and howie were the same. howie had never been
able to keep a girl. he kind of resented howie including him in his class. but he wanted
to get away so badly that when howie suggested it he said let's go tomorrow.
he lay on the gravel car and remembered all the camping trips and the swell times he
and bill harper had had 
 
 ___________________________
 
ll is too good a friend to
lose even over diane and tomorrow i will tell him so. tomorrow i will go over to his
house and say bill let's forget about it. bill let's be friends because it won't ever happen
again.
and then as the gravel train got closer to shale city he thought back to diane again.
in the coolness of the night he could bring her face up before his mind. he hadn't been
able to do it out there on the desert. he could bring her face up before his mind and she
was smiling. he thought howie believed he had lost onie but he hadn't because onie
admitted she was wrong and asked him to come back. he thought besides i don't want
diane running around with glen hogan. anybody but glen hogan. just because glen
had a good looking car he seemed to think he could take liberties with a girl that the
ordinary guy would never think of. he felt scary whenever he thought of diane and glen
hogan together. he saw where it was more or less his duty to see diane and talk to her
like a brother and tel
 
 ___________________________
 
l her about glen hogan. he knew that he had to save diane the embarrassment
of finding out for herself what kind of guy glen hogan was. he must do that
even at the expense of his pride.
they dropped off the gravel train just outside the station because they didn't want
anybody to see them they were such sights. they walked for two blocks and then howie
stopped.
"well i'll be leaving you here."
"where are you going?"
"thought i'd drop by onie's house."
howie said it in a dreamy kind of way and a little insinuating too because he knew
there was no place for joe to go but home. howie who could never keep a girl. huh!
howie walked off into the darkness. he was all alone. he started home. shale city
seemed like the prettiest town in the world that night. the sky was pale blue and there
were about a million stars shining. the trees were all black-green and a cool breeze was
playing through them. it seemed all of a sudden as if the desert and the section

ful thing was that she had done something he couldn't forgive her
for ever no matter how much he wanted to. and he did want to. he did want to awfully.
but he never could.
going to bed he thought oh why does a guy have to go through something like this?
he thought why don't they take him out and shoot him while there's still something worth
while in him? he thought why everybody has a best friend. even guys in the penitentiary
probably have best friends somewhere. but i haven't. he thought even howie has a girl.
even those mexicans singing on their way out of the desert have girls. but i haven't. he
thought why everybody can find some little spark of self respect inside himself. even a
murderer or a thief or a dog or an ant has something that keeps its head up and going. but
i haven't.
that night in bed was the first time he ever cried over a girl. he just lay there and
bawled like a kid. his hands were bloody and his legs were full of thistles and his eyes
were full of tears and he was sic

k at heart. it took him a long time to go to sleep.
it all seemed so real at the time and now it wasn't real at all. that was a long time
ago. that was in shale city. that was before he came to los angeles. that was when he
was a kid in high school. it seemed so long ago. somewhere probably in colorado glen
hogan and howie were still kicking around. he had got a letter once saying bill harper
had been killed at belleau wood. bill harper was a lucky guy. bill harper had got diane
and then he had been killed.
oh christ he was all mixed up again. he didn't know where he was or what he was
doing. but he was cooling off. he wasn't burning up any more. he was just light headed
and confused and he couldn't figure things out. everything was a mess but at least he was
cool.

he couldn't get used to the way things
