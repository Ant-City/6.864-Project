Cecily Cardew - 
                Jack's
ward, the granddaughter of the old gentlemen who found and adopted
Jack when Jack was a baby. Cecily is probably the most realistically
drawn character in the play. Like Gwendolen, she is obsessed with
the name Ernest, but she is even more intrigued by the idea of wickedness.
This idea, rather than the virtuous-sounding name, has prompted
her to fall in love with Jack's brother Ernest in her imagination
and to invent an elaborate romance and courtship between them.
