explanatory

in this book a number of dialects are used, to wit:  the missouri negro
dialect; the extremest form of the backwoods southwestern dialect; the
ordinary â€œpike countyâ€ dialect; and four modified varieties of this
last. the shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion, or by
guesswork; but painstakingly, and with the trustworthy guidance and
support of personal famili

light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed.  then i slipped
down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,
there was tom sawyer waiting for me.




chapter ii.

we went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of
the widowâ€™s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldnâ€™t scrape our
heads. when we was passing by the kitchen i fell over a root and made
a noise.  we scrouched down and laid still.  miss watsonâ€™s big nigger,
named jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty
clear, because there was a light behind him.  he got up and stretched
his neck out about a minute, listening.  then he says:

â€œwho dah?â€

he listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right
between us; we could a touched him, nearly.  well, likely it was
minutes and minutes that there warnâ€™t a sound, and we all there so close
together.  there was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but i
dasnâ€™t scratch it; and
 
 ___________________________
 
 then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,
right between my shoulders.  seemed like iâ€™d die if i couldnâ€™t scratch.
 well, iâ€™ve noticed that thing plenty times since.  if you are with
the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ainâ€™t
sleepy--if you are anywheres where it wonâ€™t do for you to scratch, why
you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. pretty soon jim
says:

â€œsay, who is you?  whar is you?  dog my cats ef i didnâ€™ hear sumfâ€™n.
well, i know what iâ€™s gwyne to do:  iâ€™s gwyne to set down here and
listen tell i hears it agin.â€

so he set down on the ground betwixt me and tom.  he leaned his back up
against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched
one of mine.  my nose begun to itch.  it itched till the tears come into
my eyes.  but i dasnâ€™t scratch.  then it begun to itch on the inside.
next i got to itching u

nderneath.  i didnâ€™t know how i was going to set
still. this miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but
it seemed a sight longer than that.  i was itching in eleven different
places now.  i reckoned i couldnâ€™t stand it moreâ€™n a minute longer,
but i set my teeth hard and got ready to try.  just then jim begun
to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then i was pretty soon
comfortable again.

tom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and we
went creeping away on our hands and knees.  when we was ten foot off tom
whispered to me, and wanted to tie jim to the tree for fun.  but i said
no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then theyâ€™d find out i
warnâ€™t in. then tom said he hadnâ€™t got candles enough, and he would slip
in the kitchen and get some more.  i di

dnâ€™t want him to try.  i said jim
might wake up and come.  but tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there
and got three candles, and tom laid five cents on the table for pay.
then we got out, and i was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do
tom but he must crawl to where jim was, on his hands and knees, and play
something on him.  i waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was
so still and lonesome.

as soon as tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,
and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of
the house.  tom said he slipped jimâ€™s hat off of his head and hung it
on a limb right over him, and jim stirred a little, but he didnâ€™t wake.
afterwards jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,
and
 
 ___________________________
 
 rode him all over the state, and then set him under the trees again,
and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it.  and next time jim told
it he said they rode him down to new orleans; and, after that, every
time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they
rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back
was all over saddle-boils.  jim was monstrous proud about it, and he
got so he wouldnâ€™t hardly notice the other niggers.  niggers would come
miles to hear jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any
nigger in that country.  strange niggers would stand with their mouths
open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder.  niggers is
always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but
whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things,
jim would happen in and say, â€œhm!  what

 you know â€˜bout witches?â€ and
that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat.  jim always kept
that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a
charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could
cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by
saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it.
 niggers would come from all around there and give jim anything they
had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldnâ€™t touch
it, because the devil had had his hands on it.  jim was most ruined for
a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil
and been rode by witches.

well, when tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down
into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where
there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever
so fine; and down by the vil

he studied a while, and then he says:

â€œoho-o!  i think i see.  you want to _sell_ all your property to me--not
give it.  thatâ€™s the correct idea.â€

then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:

â€œthere; you see it says â€˜for a consideration.â€™  that means i have bought
it of you and paid you for it.  hereâ€™s a dollar for you.  now you sign
it.â€

so i signed it, and left.

miss watsonâ€™s nigger, jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, which
had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do
magic with it.  he said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed
everything.  so i went to him that night and told him pap was here
again, for i found his tracks in the snow.  what i wanted to know was,
what he was going to do, and was he going to stay?  jim got out his
hair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up and dropped
it on the floor.  it fell pretty soli

 jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the same.
 jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it and listened.
 but it warnâ€™t no use; he said it wouldnâ€™t talk. he said sometimes it
wouldnâ€™t talk without money.  i told him i had an old slick counterfeit
quarter that warnâ€™t no good because the brass showed through the silver
a little, and it wouldnâ€™t pass nohow, even if the brass didnâ€™t show,
because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it
every time.  (i reckoned i wouldnâ€™t say nothing about the dollar i go

from the judge.) i said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball
would take it, because maybe it wouldnâ€™t know the difference.  jim smelt
it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball
would think it was good.  he said he would split open a raw irish potato
and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next
morning you couldnâ€™t see no brass, and it wouldnâ€™t feel greasy no more,
and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball.
 well, i knowed a potato would do that before, but i had forgot it.

jim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and li

again. this time he said the hair-ball was all right.  he said it
would tell my whole fortune if i wanted it to.  i says, go on.  so the
hair-ball talked to jim, and jim told it to me.  he says:

â€œyoâ€™ ole father doanâ€™ know yit what heâ€™s a-gwyne to do.  sometimes he
spec heâ€™ll go â€˜way, en den agin he spec heâ€™ll stay.  de besâ€™ way is to

 catched a glimpse of fire away
through the trees.  i went for it, cautious and slow.  by and by i was
close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground.  it
most give me the fan-tods. he had a blanket around his head, and his
head was nearly in the fire.  i set there behind a clump of bushes, in
about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady.  it was getting
gray daylight now.  pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove
off the blanket, and it was miss watsonâ€™s jim!  i bet i was glad to see
him.  i says:

â€œhello, jim!â€ and skipped out.

he bounced up and stared at me wild.  then he drops down on his knees,
and puts his hands together and says:

â€œdoanâ€™ hurt me--donâ€™t!  i hainâ€™t ever done no harm to a ghosâ€™.  i alwuz
liked dead people, en done all i could for â€˜em.  you go en git in de

d.  i was ever so
glad to see jim.  i warnâ€™t lonesome now.  i told him i warnâ€™t afraid of
_him_ telling the people where i was.  i talked along, but he only set
there and looked at me; never said nothing.  then i says:

â€œitâ€™s good daylight.  leâ€™s get breakfast.  make up your camp fire good.â€

â€œwhatâ€™s de use er makinâ€™ up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich
truck? but you got a gun, hainâ€™t you?  den we kin git sumfn better den

â€œstrawberries and such truck,â€ i says.  â€œis that what you

â€œi couldnâ€™ git nuffn else,â€ he says.

â€œwhy, how long you been on the island, jim?â€

â€œi come heah de night arter youâ€™s killed.â€

â€œwhat, all that time?â€

â€œyes--indeedy.â€

â€œand ainâ€™t you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?â€

â€œno, sah--nuffn else.â€

â€œwell, you must be most starved, ainâ€™t you?â€

â€œi reckâ€™n i could eat a hoss.  i think i could. how long you ben on de

â€œsince the night i got killed.â€

â€œno!  wâ€™y, what has you lived on?  but you got a gun.  oh, yes, you got

so we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in
a grassy open place amongst the trees, i fetched meal and bacon and
coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the
nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done
with witchcraft. i catched a good big catfish, too, and jim cleaned him
with his knife, and fried him.

when breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.
jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved.  then
when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied.  by and by
jim says:

â€œbut looky here, huck, who wuz it dat â€˜uz killed in dat shanty ef it
warnâ€™t you?â€

then i told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart.  he said tom
sawyer couldnâ€™t get up no better plan than what i had.  then i says:

â€œhow do you come to be here, jim, and howâ€™d you get here?â€

he looked pretty uneasy, and didnâ€™t say nothi

ng for a minute.  then he
says:

â€œmaybe i better not tell.â€

â€œwhy, jim?â€

â€œwell, deyâ€™s reasons.  but you wouldnâ€™ tell on me ef i uz to tell you,
would you, huck?â€

â€œblamed if i would, jim.â€

â€œwell, i bâ€™lieve you, huck.  i--_i run off_.â€

â€œjim!â€

â€œbut mind, you said you wouldnâ€™ tell--you know you said you wouldnâ€™ tell,
huck.â€

â€œwell, i did.  i said i wouldnâ€™t, and iâ€™ll stick to it.  honest _injun_,
i will.  people would call me a low-down abolitionist and despise me for
keeping mum--but that donâ€™t make no difference.  i ainâ€™t a-going to tell,
and i ainâ€™t a-going back there, anyways.  so, now, leâ€™s know all about
it.â€

â€œwell, you see, it â€˜uz dis way.  ole missus--datâ€™s miss watson--she pecks

â€œwell, thatâ€™s so.  youâ€™ve had to keep in the woods all the time, of

â€œoh, yes.  i knowed dey was arter you.  i see um go by heah--watched um

some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and
lighting. jim said it was a sign it was going to rain.  he said it was
a sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the
same way when young birds done it.  i was going to catch some of them,
but jim wouldnâ€™t let me.  he said it was death.  he said his father laid
mighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old granny
said his father would die, and he did.

and jim said you mustnâ€™t count the things you are going to cook for
dinner, because that would bring bad luck.

the same if you shook the
table-cloth after sundown.  and he said if a man owned a beehive
and that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next
morning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die.
 jim said bees wouldnâ€™t sting idiots; but i didnâ€™t believe that, because
i had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldnâ€™t sting me.

i had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them.  jim
knowed all kinds of signs.  he said he knowed most everything.  i said
it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so i asked
him if there warnâ€™t any good-luck signs.  he says:

â€œmighty few--anâ€™ _dey_ ainâ€™t no use to a body.  what you want to know
when good luckâ€™s a-cominâ€™ for?  want to keep it off?â€  and he said:  â€œef

â€œso i done it.  den i reckâ€™nâ€™d iâ€™d invesâ€™ de thirty-five dollars right

i was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,
because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile
wide.

this place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot
high. we had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and
the bushes so thick.  we tramped and clumb around all over it, and by
and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the
side towards illinois.  the cavern was as big as two or three rooms
bunched together, and jim could stand up straight in it.  it was cool in
there. jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but i said we
didnâ€™t want to be climbing up and down there all the time.

jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps
in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island,
and they would never find us without dogs.  and, besides, he said them
little birds had said it was going to rain, and did i want the things to
get wet?

so we went back and

 the bluest and
blackest--_fst_! it was as bright as glory, and youâ€™d have a little
glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm,
hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again
in a second, and now youâ€™d hear the thunder let go with an awful crash,
and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the
under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs--where
itâ€™s long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.

 we paddled out and got
aboard--clumb in at an upstairs window.  but it was too dark to see yet,
so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.

the light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island.  then
we looked in at the window.  we could make out a bed, and a table, and
two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there
was clothes hanging against the wall.  there was something laying on the
floor in the far corner that looked like a man.  so jim says:

â€œhello, you!â€

but it didnâ€™t budge.  so i hollered again, and then jim says:

â€œde man ainâ€™t asleep--heâ€™s dead.  you hold still--iâ€™ll go en see.â€

he went, and bent down and looked, and says:

â€œitâ€™s a dead man.  yes, indeedy; naked, too.  heâ€™s ben shot in de back.
i reckâ€™n heâ€™s ben dead two er three days.  come in, huck, but doanâ€™ look
at his face--itâ€™s too gashly.â€

i didnâ€™t look at him at all.  jim throwed some old rags over him, but
he neednâ€™t done i

ndles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty
old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and
beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet
and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some
monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar,
and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didnâ€™t have no label
on them; and just as we was leaving i found a tolerable good curry-comb,
and jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg.  the straps
was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though
it was too long for me and not long enough for jim, and we couldnâ€™t find
the other one, though we hunted all around.

and so, take it all around, we made a good haul.  when we was ready to
shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty
broad day; so i made jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the
quilt, because if he set up pe

ople could tell he was a nigger a good
ways off.  i paddled over to the illinois shore, and drifted down most
a half a mile doing it.  i crept up the dead water under the bank, and
hadnâ€™t no accidents and didnâ€™t see nobody.  we got home all safe.




chapter x.

after breakfast i wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he
come to be killed, but jim didnâ€™t want to.  he said it would fetch bad
luck; and besides, he said, he might come and haâ€™nt us; he said a man
that warnâ€™t buried was more likely to go a-haâ€™nting around than one
that was planted and comfortable.  that sounded pretty reasonable, so
i didnâ€™t say no more; but i couldnâ€™t keep from studying over it and
wishing i knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for.

we rummaged the clothes weâ€™d got, and found eight dollars in silver
sewed up in the lining of an old b

lanket overcoat.  jim said he reckoned
the people in that house stole the coat, because if theyâ€™d a knowed the
money was there they wouldnâ€™t a left it.  i said i reckoned they killed
him, too; but jim didnâ€™t want to talk about that.  i says:

â€œnow you think itâ€™s bad luck; but what did you say when i fetched in the
snake-skin that i found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday?
you said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin
with my hands.  well, hereâ€™s your bad luck!  weâ€™ve raked in all this
truck and eight dollars besides.  i wish we could have some bad luck
like this every day, jim.â€

it did come, too.  it was a tuesday that we had that talk.  well, after
dinner friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the
ridge, and got out of tobacco.  i went to the cavern to get some, and
found a rattlesnake in there.  i killed him, and curled him up on the
foot of jimâ€™s blanket, ever so natural, thinking thereâ€™d be some fun
when jim found him there.  well, by night i forgot all about the snake,
and when jim flung himself down on the blanket while i struck a light
the snakeâ€™s mate was there, and bit him.

he jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the
varmint curled up and ready for another spring.  i laid him out in a
second with a stick, and jim grabbed papâ€™s whisky-jug and begun to pour
it down.

he was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel.  that all
comes of my being such a fool as

 to not remember that wherever you leave
a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it.  jim told
me to chop off the snakeâ€™s head and throw it away, and then skin the
body and roast a piece of it.  i done it, and he eat it and said it
would help cure him. he made me take off the rattles and tie them around
his wrist, too.  he said that that would help.  then i slid out quiet
and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for i warnâ€™t going
to let jim find out it was all my fault, not if i could help it.

jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his
head and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he
went to sucking at the jug again.  his foot swelled up pretty big, and
so did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so i judged
he was all right; but iâ€™d druther been bit with a snake than papâ€™s
whisky.

jim was laid up for four days and nights.  then the swelling was all
gone and he

 was around again.  i made up my mind i wouldnâ€™t ever take
a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that i see what had come
of it. jim said he reckoned i would believe him next time.  and he said
that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadnâ€™t
got to the end of it yet.  he said he druther see the new moon over his
left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin
in his hand.  well, i was getting to feel that way myself, though iâ€™ve
always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is
one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do.  old hank

he first thing we done was to bait one of the big
hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was
as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two
hundred pounds. we couldnâ€™t handle him, of course; he would a flung us
into illinois.  we just set there and watched him rip and tear around
till he drownded.  we found a brass button in his stomach and a round
ball, and lots of rubbage.  we split the ball open with the hatchet,
and there was a spool in it.  jim said heâ€™d had it there a long time, to
coat it over so and make a ball of it.  it was as big a fish as was ever
catched in the mississippi, i reckon.  jim said he hadnâ€™t ever seen
a bigger one.  he would a been worth a good deal over at the village.
 they peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house
there; everybody buys some of him; his meatâ€™s as white as snow and makes
a good fry.

next morning i said it was getting slow and dull, and i wanted to get a

e way.  i said i reckoned i would slip over the river and
find out what was going on.  jim liked that notion; but he said i
must go in the dark and look sharp.  then he studied it over and said,
couldnâ€™t i put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?
 that was a good notion, too.  so we shortened up one of the calico
gowns, and i turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it.  jim
hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit.  i put on the
sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in
and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe.  jim said
nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly.  i practiced around
all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by i could do pretty
well in them, only jim said i didnâ€™t walk like a girl; and he said
i must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket.  i took

â€œwho done it?  weâ€™ve heard considerable about these goings on down in

â€œwell, i reckon thereâ€™s a right smart chance of people _here_ thatâ€™d
like to know who killed him.  some think old finn done it himself.â€

â€œno--is that so?â€

â€œmost everybody thought it at first.  heâ€™ll never know how nigh he come
to getting lynched.  but before night they changed around and judged it

â€œthe nigger run off the very night huck finn was killed.  so thereâ€™s a

morning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with â€˜em on the

 clock begin to strike, so i stops and listens; the
sound come faint over the water but clear--eleven.  when i struck the
head of the island i never waited to blow, though i was most winded, but
i shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and started
a good fire there on a high and dry spot.

then i jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half
below, as hard as i could go.  i landed, and slopped through the timber
and up the ridge and into the cavern.  there jim laid, sound asleep on
the ground.  i roused him out and says:

â€œgit up and hump yourself, jim!  there ainâ€™t a minute to lose.  theyâ€™re
after us!â€

jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he
worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared.  by
that time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was
ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid.  we
put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didnâ€™t show 
 
 ___________________________
 
 raft did seem to go mighty slow.  if a boat was to come
along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the illinois
shore; and it was well a boat didnâ€™t come, for we hadnâ€™t ever thought to
put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat.  we
was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things.  it warnâ€™t
good judgment to put _everything_ on the raft.

if the men went to the island i just expect they found the camp fire i
built, and watched it all night for jim to come.  anyways, they stayed
away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warnâ€™t no
fault of mine.  i played it as low down on them as i could.

when the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a
big bend on the illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with
the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there
had been a cave-in in the bank there.  a tow-head is a sandbar that has
cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.

we had mountains on the missouri shore and heavy timber on the illinois
side, and the channel was down the missouri shore at that place, so we
warnâ€™t afraid of anybody running across us.  we laid there all day,
and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the missouri shore, and
up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle.  i told jim all
about the time i had jabbering with that woman; and jim said she was
a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldnâ€™t set
down and watch a camp fire--no, sir, sheâ€™d fetch a dog.  well, then, i
said, why couldnâ€™t she tell her husband to fetch a dog?  jim said he
bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he
believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that
time, or else we wouldnâ€™t be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile
below the village--no, indeedy, we would be in tha

t same old town again.
 so i said i didnâ€™t care what was the reason they didnâ€™t get us as long
as they didnâ€™t.

when it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the
cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;
so jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug
wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things
dry. jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above
the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of
reach of steamboat waves.  right in the middle of the wigwam we made a
layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for
to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather
or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen.  we made an extra
steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag

t does, and a good deed ainâ€™t ever forgot.  i never see
pap when he didnâ€™t want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to
say, anyway.

mornings before daylight i slipped into cornfields and borrowed a
watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of
that kind.  pap always said it warnâ€™t no harm to borrow things if you
was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warnâ€™t
anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.
 jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly
right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things
from the list and say we wouldnâ€™t borrow them any more--then he reckoned
it wouldnâ€™t be no harm to borrow the others.  so we talked it over all
one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds
whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,
or what.  but towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and

owl now and then that got up too early in the morning
or didnâ€™t go to bed early enough in the evening.  take it all round, we
lived pretty high.

the fifth night below st. louis we had a big storm after midnight, with
a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid
sheet. we stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.
when the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,
and high, rocky bluffs on both sides.  by and by says i, â€œhel-_lo_, jim,
looky yonder!â€ it was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock.
 we was drifting straight down for her.  the lightning showed her very
distinct.  she was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above
water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a
chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it,
when the flashes come.

well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like,

 when i see that wreck
laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river.  i
wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what
there was there.  so i says:

â€œleâ€™s land on her, jim.â€

but jim was dead against it at first.  he says:

en we better let blameâ€™ well alone, as de good book says.  like as not

his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when

couldnâ€™t say nothing to that, so he didnâ€™t try.  â€œand besides,â€ i says,
â€œwe might borrow something worth having out of the captainâ€™s stateroom.
 seegars, i bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash.  steamboat
captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and _they_ donâ€™t
care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it.  stick a
candle in your pocket; i canâ€™t rest, jim, till we give her a rummaging.
 do you reckon tom sawyer would ever go by this thing?  not for pie, he
wouldnâ€™t. heâ€™d call it an adventure--thatâ€™s what heâ€™d call it; and heâ€™d
land on that wreck if it was his last act.  and wouldnâ€™t he throw style
into it?--wouldnâ€™t he spread himself, nor nothing?  why, youâ€™d think it
was christopher câ€™lumbus discovering kingdom-come.  i wish tom sawyer

wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and
made fast there.

the deck was high out here.  we went sneaking down the slope of it to
labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our
feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so
dark we couldnâ€™t see no sign of them.  pretty soon we struck the forward
end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in
front of the captainâ€™s door, which was open, and by jimminy, away down
through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we
seem to hear low voices in yonder!

jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come
along.  i says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just
then i heard a voice wail out and say:

â€œoh, please donâ€™t, boys; i swear i wonâ€™t ever tell!â€

another voice said, pretty loud:

â€œitâ€™s a lie, jim turner.  youâ€™ve acted this way before.  you always want

youâ€™ve swore â€˜t if you didnâ€™t youâ€™d tell.  but this time youâ€™ve said
it jest one time too many.  youâ€™re the meanest, treacherousest hound in
this country.â€

by this time jim was gone for the raft.  i was just a-biling with
curiosity; and i says to myself, tom sawyer wouldnâ€™t back out now,
and so i wonâ€™t either; iâ€™m a-going to see whatâ€™s going on here.  so i
dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft
in the dark till there warnâ€™t but one stateroom betwixt me and the
cross-hall of the texas.  then in there i see a man stretched on the
floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one
of them had a dim lantern in hi

 â€œoh, please donâ€™t, bill;
i hainâ€™t ever goinâ€™ to tell.â€

and every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and
say:

â€œâ€˜deed you _ainâ€™t!_  you never said no truer thing â€˜n that, you bet
you.â€ and once he said:  â€œhear him beg! and yit if we hadnâ€™t got the
best of him and tied him heâ€™d a killed us both.  and what _for_?  jist
for nothâ€™n. jist because we stood on our _rights_--thatâ€™s what for.  but
i lay you ainâ€™t a-goinâ€™ to threaten nobody any more, jim turner.  put

bill says:

â€œi donâ€™t want to, jake packard.  iâ€™m for killinâ€™ him--and didnâ€™t he kill
old hatfield jist the same way--and donâ€™t he deserve it?â€

â€œbut i donâ€™t _want_ him killed, and iâ€™ve got my reasons for it.â€

â€œbless yoâ€™ heart for them words, jake packard!  iâ€™ll never forgit you
longâ€™s i live!â€ says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.

packard didnâ€™t take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail

 iâ€™m unfavorable to killinâ€™ a man as long as you can git arounâ€™ it; it
ainâ€™t good sense, it ainâ€™t good morals.  ainâ€™t i right?â€

â€œyes, i reckâ€™n you are.  but sâ€™pose she _donâ€™t_ break up and wash off?â€

â€œwell, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, canâ€™t we?â€

â€œall right, then; come along.â€

so they started, and i lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled
forward. it was dark as pitch there; but i said, in a kind of a coarse
whisper, â€œjim!â€ and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a
moan, and i says:

â€œquick, jim, it ainâ€™t no time for fooling around and moaning; thereâ€™s a
gang of murderers in yonder, and if we donâ€™t hunt up their boat and set
her drifting down the river so these fellows canâ€™t get away from the
wreck thereâ€™s one of â€˜em going to be in a bad fix.  but if we find their

well, i catched my breath and most fainted.  shut up on a wreck with
such a gang as that!  but it warnâ€™t no time to be sentimentering.  weâ€™d
_got_ to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves.  so we went
a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was,
too--seemed a week before we got to the stern.  no sign of a boat.  jim
said he didnâ€™t believe he could go any further--so scared he hadnâ€™t
hardly any strength left, he said.  but i said, come on, if we get left
on this wreck we are in a fix, sure.  so on we prowled again.  we struck
for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along
forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the
edge of the skylight was in the water.  when we got pretty close to the
cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough!  i could just barely

says:

â€œhold on--â€˜d you go through him?â€

â€œno.  so heâ€™s got his share oâ€™ the cash yet.â€

â€œwell, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.â€

â€œsay, wonâ€™t he suspicion what weâ€™re up to?â€

â€œmaybe he wonâ€™t.  but we got to have it anyway. come along.â€

so they got out and went in.

the door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half
second i was in the boat, and jim come tumbling after me.  i out with my
knife and cut the rope, and away we went!

we didnâ€™t touch an oar, and we didnâ€™t speak nor whisper, nor hardly even
breathe.  we went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the
paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was a
hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, every
last sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.

when we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern

ke a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed
by that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to
understand that they was in just as much trouble now as jim turner was.

then jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft.  now was the
first time that i begun to worry about the men--i reckon i hadnâ€™t
had time to before.  i begun to think how dreadful it was, even for
murderers, to be in such a fix.  i says to myself, there ainâ€™t no
telling but i might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how would
i like it?  so says i to jim:

â€œthe first light we see weâ€™ll land a hundred yards below it or above
it, in a place where itâ€™s a good hiding-place for you

or lights and watching for our raft.  after a long time the
rain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering,
and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we
made for it.

it was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again.  we
seen a light now away down to the right, on shore.  so i said i would
go for it. the skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole
there on the wreck.  we hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and i told
jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone
about two mile, and keep it burning till i come; then i manned my oars
and shoved for the light.  as i got down towards it three or four more
showed--up on a hillside.  it was a village.  i closed in above the shore
light, and laid on my oars and floated.  as i went by i see it was a
lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat.  i skimmed
around for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by and
by i fo

â€œtheyâ€™re--theyâ€™re--are you the watchman of the boat?â€

â€œyes,â€ he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like.  â€œiâ€™m the captain
and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head

â€œwhy _thatâ€™s_ all right.  miss hooker she tole me, _particular_, that
her uncle hornback--â€

â€œgreat guns! is _he_ her uncle?  looky here, you break for that light
over yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and about a
quarter of a mile out youâ€™ll come to the tavern; tell â€˜em to dart you
out to jim hornbackâ€™s, and heâ€™ll foot the bill.  and donâ€™t you fool
around any, because heâ€™ll want to know the news.  tell him iâ€™ll have
his niece all safe before he can get to town.  hump yourself, now; iâ€™m
a-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer.â€

i struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner i went back
and got into my skiff and bailed her out, and then pulled up shore in
the easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among
some woodboats; f

it i could.

then here comes the ferryboat; so i shoved for the middle of the river
on a long down-stream slant; and when i judged i was out of eye-reach
i laid on my oars, and looked back and see her go and smell around the
wreck for miss hookerâ€™s remainders, because the captain would know her
uncle hornback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give
it up and went for the shore, and i laid into my work and went a-booming
down the river.

it did seem a powerful long time before jimâ€™s light showed up; and when
it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off.  by the time i
got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east; so we
struck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and turned
in and slept like dead people.

off of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and all

our lives.  the seegars was prime.  we laid off all the afternoon in the
woods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general good
time. i told jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the
ferryboat, and i said these kinds of things was adventures; but he said
he didnâ€™t want no more adventures.  he said that when i went in the
texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he
nearly died, because he judged it was all up with _him_ anyway it could
be fixed; for if he didnâ€™t get saved he would get drownded; and if he
did get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get
the reward, and then mi

how gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called each

 was making the trouble for me.  well, i fought along, and directly
i hears the whoop _behind_ me.  i was tangled good now.  that was
somebody elseâ€™s whoop, or else i was turned around.

i throwed the paddle down.  i heard the whoop again; it was behind me
yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its
place, and i kept answering, till by and by it was in front of me again,
and i knowed the current had swung the canoeâ€™s head down-stream, and i
was all right if that was jim and not some other raftsman hollering.
 i couldnâ€™t tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing donâ€™t look
natural nor sound natural in a fog.

the whooping went on, and in about a minute i come a-booming down on a
cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed
me off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly
roared, the currrent was tearing by them so swift.

in another second or two it was solid white and still again.  i set
perfectly still the

n, listening to my heart thump, and i reckon i didnâ€™t
draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.

i just give up then.  i knowed what the matter was.  that cut bank
was an island, and jim had gone down tâ€™other side of it.  it warnâ€™t no
towhead that you could float by in ten minutes.  it had the big timber
of a regular island; it might be five or six miles long and more than
half a mile wide.

i kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, i reckon.  i
was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you donâ€™t
ever think of that.  no, you _feel_ like you are laying dead still on
the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you donâ€™t think

knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.

i had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to
keep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so i judged the
raft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would
get further ahead and clear out of hearing--it was floating a little
faster than what i was.

well, i seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but i couldnâ€™t
hear no sign of a whoop nowheres.  i reckoned jim had fetched up on a
snag, maybe, and it was all up with him.  i was good and tired, so i
laid down in the canoe and said i wouldnâ€™t bother no more.  i didnâ€™t
want to go to sleep, of course; but i was so sleepy i couldnâ€™t help it;
so i thought i would take jest one little cat-nap.

but i reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when i waked up the stars
was shining bright, the fog was all gone, and i was spinning down a
big bend stern first.  first i didnâ€™t know where i was; i thought i wa

back to me they seemed to come
up dim out of last week.

it was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest
kind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as i could see
by the stars.  i looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the
water. i took after it; but when i got to it it warnâ€™t nothing but a
couple of sawlogs made fast together.  then i see another speck, and
chased that; then another, and this time i was right.  it was the raft.

when i got to it jim was setting there with his head down between his
knees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar.  the
other oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and
branches and dirt.  so sheâ€™d had a rough time.

i made fast and laid down under jimâ€™s nose on the raft, and began to
gap, and stretch my fists out against jim, and says:

â€œhello, jim, have i been asleep?  why didnâ€™t you stir me up?â€

â€œgoodness gracious, is dat you, huck?  en you ainâ€™ dead--you

â€œwhatâ€™s the matter with you, jim?  you been a-drinking?â€

â€œdrinkinâ€™?  has i ben a-drinkinâ€™?  has i had a chance to be a-drinkinâ€™?â€

â€œwell, then, what makes you talk so wild?â€

â€œhow does i talk wild?â€

stuff, as if iâ€™d been gone away?â€

â€œwell, this is too many for me, jim.  i hainâ€™t seen no fog, nor no
islands, nor no troubles, nor nothing.  i been setting here talking with
you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and i reckon
i done the same.  you couldnâ€™t a got drunk in that time, so of course
youâ€™ve been dreaming.â€

â€œdad fetch it, how is i gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?â€

â€œwell, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didnâ€™t any of it

â€œbut, huck, itâ€™s all jisâ€™ as plain to me as--â€

â€œit donâ
 
 ___________________________
 
€™t make no difference how plain it is; there ainâ€™t nothing in it.
i know, because iâ€™ve been here all the time.â€

jim didnâ€™t say nothing for about five minutes, but set there studying
over it.  then he says:

â€œwell, den, i reckâ€™n i did dream it, huck; but dog my cats ef it ainâ€™t
de powerfullest dream i ever see.  en i hainâ€™t ever had no dream bâ€™foâ€™
datâ€™s tired me like dis one.â€

â€œoh, well, thatâ€™s all right, because a dream does tire a body like
everything sometimes.  but this one was a staving dream; tell me all
about it, jim.â€

so jim went to work and told me the whole thing right thro

 of it.  the lot of towheads was troubles
we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean
folks, but if we minded our business and didnâ€™t talk back and aggravate
them, we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big
clear river, which was the free states, and wouldnâ€™t have no more
trouble.

it had clouded up pretty dark just after i got on to the raft, but it
was clearing up again now.

â€œoh, well, thatâ€™s all interpreted well enough as far as it goes, jim,â€ i
says; â€œbut what does _these_ things stand for?â€

it was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar.  you
could see them first-rate now.

jim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash
again.  he had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he
couldnâ€™t seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place
again right away.  but when he did get the thing straightened around he
looked at me steady without ever smiling, and says:

â€œwhat

is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey frenâ€™s en makes â€˜em

then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there without
saying anything but that.  but that was enough.  it made me feel so mean
i could almost kissed _his_ foot to get him to take it back.

it was fifteen minutes before i could work myself up to go and humble
myself to a nigger; but i done it, and i warnâ€™t ever sorry for it
afterwards, neither.

 as that.

we went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got
hot.  the river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on
both sides; you couldnâ€™t see a break in it hardly ever, or a light.  we
talked about cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to
it.  i said likely we wouldnâ€™t, because i had heard say there warnâ€™t but
about a dozen houses there, and if they didnâ€™t happen to have them lit
up, how was we going to know we was passing a town?  jim said if the two
big rivers joined together there, that would show.  but i said maybe
we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the
same old river again. that disturbed jim--and me too.  so the question
was, what to do?  i said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed,
and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and
was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to
cairo.  jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on
 
 ___________________________
 
 it and
waited.

there warnâ€™t nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and
not pass it without seeing it.  he said heâ€™d be mighty sure to see it,
because heâ€™d be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it
heâ€™d be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom.  every
little while he jumps up and says:

â€œdah she is?â€

but it warnâ€™t.  it was jack-oâ€™-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set
down again, and went to watching, same as before.  jim said it made him
all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom.  well, i can
tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him,
because i begun to get it through my head that he _was_ most free--and
who was to blame for it?  why, _me_.  i couldnâ€™t get that out of my
conscience, no how nor no way. it got to troubling me so i couldnâ€™t
rest; i couldnâ€™t stay still in one place.  it hadnâ€™t ever come home to
me before, what this thing was that i was doing.  but now
 
 ___________________________
 
 it did; and it
stayed with me, and scorched me more and more.  i tried to make out to
myself that i warnâ€™t to blame, because i didnâ€™t run jim off from his
rightful owner; but it warnâ€™t no use, conscience up and says, every
time, â€œbut you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a
paddled ashore and told somebody.â€  that was so--i couldnâ€™t get around
that noway.  that was where it pinched.  conscience says to me, â€œwhat
had poor miss watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off
right under your eyes and never say one single word?  what did that poor
old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean? 
 
 ___________________________
 
 why, she tried to
learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to
be good to you every way she knowed how.  _thatâ€™s_ what she done.â€

i got to feeling so mean and so miserable i most wished i was dead.  i
fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and jim was
fidgeting up and down past me.  we neither of us could keep still.
 every time he danced around and says, â€œdahâ€™s cairo!â€ it went through me
like a shot, and i thought if it _was_ cairo i reckoned i would die of
miserableness.

jim talked out loud all the time while i was talking to myself.  he was
saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free state he
would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he
got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned
 
 ___________________________
 
talk in his life before.  just see what a difference it made in him the
minute he judged he was about free.  it was according to the old saying,
â€œgive a nigger an inch and heâ€™ll take an ell.â€  thinks i, this is what
comes of my not thinking.  here was this nigger, which i had as good
as helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would
steal his children--children that belonged to a man i didnâ€™t even know; a
man that hadnâ€™t ever done me no harm.

i was sorry to hear jim say that, it was such a lowering of him.  my
conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last i says
to it, â€œlet up on me--it ainâ€™t too late yet--iâ€™ll paddle ashore at the
first light and tell.â€  i felt easy and happy and light as a feather
right off.  all my troubles was gone.  i went to looking out sharp for a
light, and sort of singing to myself.  by and by one showed.  jim sings
out:

â€œweâ€™s safe, huck, weâ€™s safe!  jump up and crack yoâ€™ heels!  datâ€™s de
good
 
 ___________________________
 
 ole cairo at lasâ€™, i jis knows it!â€

i says:

â€œiâ€™ll take the canoe and go and see, jim.  it mightnâ€™t be, you know.â€

he jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom
for me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as i shoved off, he says:

â€œpooty soon iâ€™ll be a-shoutâ€™nâ€™ for joy, en iâ€™ll say, itâ€™s all on
accounts oâ€™ huck; iâ€™s a free man, en i couldnâ€™t ever ben free ef it
hadnâ€™ ben for huck; huck done it.  jim wonâ€™t ever forgit you, huck;
youâ€™s de besâ€™ frenâ€™ jimâ€™s ever had; en youâ€™s de _only_ frenâ€™ ole jimâ€™s
got now.â€

i was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says
this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me.  i went along
slow then, and i warnâ€™t right down certain whether i was glad i started
or whether i warnâ€™t.  when i was fifty yards off, jim says:

â€œdah you goes, de ole true huck; de onâ€™y white genlman dat ever kepâ€™ his
promise to ole j

 runaway niggers get by me if i
can help it.â€

they went off and i got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because i
knowed very well i had done wrong, and i see it warnâ€™t no use for me
to try to learn to do right; a body that donâ€™t get _started_ right when
heâ€™s little ainâ€™t got no show--when the pinch comes there ainâ€™t nothing
to back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat.  then i
thought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; sâ€™pose youâ€™d a done right
and give jim up, would you felt better than what you do now?  no, says
i, iâ€™d feel bad--iâ€™d feel just the same way i do now.  well, then, says
i, whatâ€™s the use you learning to do right when itâ€™s troublesome to do
right and ainâ€™t no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same?
 i was stuck.  i couldnâ€™t answer that.  so i reckoned i wouldnâ€™t bother
no more about it, but after this always do whichever come handiest at
the time.

i went into the wigwam; jim warnâ€™t there.  i looked all a

round; he
warnâ€™t anywhere.  i says:

â€œjim!â€

â€œhere i is, huck.  is dey out oâ€™ sight yit?  donâ€™t talk loud.â€

he was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out.  i told
him they were out of sight, so he come aboard.  he says:

â€œi was a-listeninâ€™ to all de talk, en i slips into de river en was gwyne
to shove for shoâ€™ if dey come aboard.  den i was gwyne to swim to de
rafâ€™ agin when dey was gone.  but lawsy, how you did fool â€˜em, huck!

™ ole
jim--ole jim ainâ€™t going to forgit you for dat, honey.â€

then we talked about the money.  it was a pretty good raise--twenty
dollars apiece.  jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat
now, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free
states. he said twenty mile more warnâ€™t far for the raft to go, but he
wished we was already there.

towards daybreak we tied up, and jim was mighty particular about hiding
the raft good.  then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and
getting all ready to quit rafting.

that night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down
in a left-hand bend.

i went off in the canoe to ask about it.  pretty soon i found a man out
in the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line.  i ranged up and says:

â€œmister, is that town cairo?â€

â€œcairo? no.  you must be a blameâ€™ fool.â€

â€œwhat town is it, mister?â€

â€œif

you want to know, go and find out.  if you stay here botherinâ€™
around me for about a half a minute longer youâ€™ll get something you
wonâ€™t want.â€

i paddled to the raft.  jim was awful disappointed, but i said never
mind, cairo would be the next place, i reckoned.

we passed another town before daylight, and i was going out again; but
it was high ground, so i didnâ€™t go.  no high ground about cairo, jim
said. i had forgot it.  we laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable
close to the left-hand bank.  i begun to suspicion something.  so did
jim.  i says:

â€œmaybe we went by cairo in the fog that night.â€

he says:

â€œdoanâ€™ leâ€™s talk about it, huck.  poâ€™ niggers canâ€™t have no luck.  i

was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black
cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged
out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining
like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right
over us.  there was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the
engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam--and as jim went
overboard on one side and i on the other, she come smashing straight
through the raft.

i dived--and i aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel
had got to go over me, and i wanted it to have plenty of room.  i could
always stay under water a minute; this time i reckon i stayed under a
minute and a half.  then i bounced for the top in a hurry, for i was
nearly busting.  i popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of
my nose, and puffed a bit.  of course there was a boo

ming current; and
of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she
stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was
churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though i
could hear her.

i sung out for jim about a dozen times, but i didnâ€™t get any answer;
so i grabbed a plank that touched me while i was â€œtreading water,â€ and
struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me.  but i made out to see
that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which
meant that i was in a crossing; so i changed off and went that way.

it was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so i was a good
long time in getting over.  i made a safe landing, and clumb up the
bank. i couldnâ€™t see bu

then he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid
him.  i poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch
as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man laying
there asleep--and, by jings, it was my old jim!

i waked him up, and i reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to
him to see me again, but it warnâ€™t.  he nearly cried he was so glad, but
he warnâ€™t surprised.  said he swum along behind me that night, and heard
me yell every time, but dasnâ€™t answer, because he didnâ€™t want nobody to
pick _him_ up and take him into slavery again.  says he:

when i got down out of the tree i crept along down the river bank a
piece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and
tugged at them till i got them ashore; then i covered up their faces,
and got away as quick as i could.  i cried a little when i was covering
up buckâ€™s face, for he was mighty good to me.

it was just dark now.  i never went near the house, but struck through
the woods and made for the swamp.  jim warnâ€™t on his island, so i
tramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows,
red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country.  the raft was
gone!  my souls, but i was scared!  i couldnâ€™t get my breath for most
a minute. then i raised a yell.  a voice not twenty-five foot from me
says:

â€œgood lanâ€™! is dat you, honey?  doanâ€™ make no noise.â€

it was jimâ€™s voice--nothing ever sounded so good before.  i run along the
bank a piece and got aboard, and jim he

iâ€™ve been killed, and floated down the river--thereâ€™s something up there
that â€˜ll help them think so--so donâ€™t you lose no time, jim, but just
shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.â€

i never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in
the middle of the mississippi.  then we hung up our signal lantern, and
judged that we was free and safe once more.  i hadnâ€™t had a bite to eat
since yesterday, so jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk,
and pork and cabbage and greens--there ainâ€™t nothing in the world so good

jim to get away from the swamp.  we said there warnâ€™t no home like a

raft donâ€™t.  you feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.

two or three days and nights went by; i reckon i might say they swum by,
they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely.  here is the way we put
in the time.  it was a monstrous big river down there--sometimes a mile
and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid

would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness.  once
there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating
tin pans so the steamboats wouldnâ€™t run over them.  a scow or a
raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and
laughing--heard them plain; but we couldnâ€™t see no sign of them; it made
you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air.
 jim said he believed it was spirits; but i says:

â€œno; spirits wouldnâ€™t say, â€˜dern the dern fog.â€™â€

soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the
middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted
her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and
talked about all kinds of things--we was always naked, day and night,
whenever the mosquitoes would let us--the new clothes buckâ€™s folks made

a spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water
you could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe
you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts.
itâ€™s lovely to live on a raft.  we had the sky up there, all speckled
with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and
discuss about whether they was made or only just happened.  jim he
allowed they was made, but i allowed they happened; i judged it would
have took too long to _make_ so many.  jim said the moon could a _laid_
them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so i didnâ€™t say nothing
against it, because iâ€™ve seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it
could be done. we used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them
streak down.  jim allowed theyâ€™d got spoiled and was hove out of the

one morning about daybreak i found a canoe and crossed over a chute to
the main shore--it was only two hundred yards--and paddled about a mile
up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if i couldnâ€™t get some
berries. just as i was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed
the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as
they could foot it.  i thought i was a goner, for whenever anybody was
after anybody i judged it was _me_--or maybe jim.  i was about to dig out
from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sung
out and begged me to save their lives--said they hadnâ€™t been doing
nothing, and was being chased for it--said there was men and dogs
a-coming.  they wanted to jump right in, but i says:

â€œdonâ€™t you do it.  i donâ€™t hear the dogs and horses yet; youâ€™ve got time
to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; then you
take to the water and wade down to me and get in--thatâ€™ll th

â€œbrought you down from whar?  whar was you brought down from?â€

â€œah, you would not believe me; the world never believes--let it pass--â€˜tis
no matter.  the secret of my birth--â€

â€œthe secret of your birth!  do you mean to say--â€

â€œgentlemen,â€ says the young man, very solemn, â€œi will reveal it to you,
for i feel i may have confidence in you.  by rights i am a duke!â€

jimâ€™s eyes bugged out when he heard that; and i reckon mine did, too.
then the baldhead says:  â€œno! you canâ€™t mean it?â€

â€œyes.  my great-grandfather, eldest son of the duke of bridgewater, fled
to this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the pure
air of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his own father
dying about the same time.  the second son of the late duke seized the
titles and estates--the infant real duke was ignored.  i am the lineal
descendant of th

at infant--i am the rightful duke of bridgewater; and
here am i, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of men, despised
by the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to the
companionship of felons on a raft!â€

jim pitied him ever so much, and so did i. we tried to comfort him, but
he said it warnâ€™t much use, he couldnâ€™t be much comforted; said if we
was a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most
anything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how.  he said we
ought to bow when we spoke to him, and say â€œyour grace,â€ or â€œmy lord,â€
 or â€œyour lordshipâ€--and he wouldnâ€™t mind it if we called him plain
â€œbridgewater,â€ which, he said, was a title anyway, and not

 a name; and
one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for
him he wanted done.

well, that was all easy, so we done it.  all through dinner jim stood
around and waited on him, and says, â€œwill yoâ€™ grace have some oâ€™ dis or
some oâ€™ dat?â€ and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to
him.

but the old man got pretty silent by and by--didnâ€™t have much to say, and
didnâ€™t look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on
around that duke.  he seemed to have something on his mind.  so, along
in the afternoon, he says:

â€œlooky here, bilgewater,â€ he says, â€œiâ€™m nation sorry for you, but you

â€œalas!â€

â€œno, you ainâ€™t the only person thatâ€™s had a secret of his birth.â€  and,
by jings, _he_ begins to cry.

â€œhold!  what do you mean?â€

â€œbilgewater, kin i trust you?â€ says the old man, still sort of sobbing.

â€œto the bitter death!â€  he took the old man by the hand and squeezed it,
and says, â€œthat secret of your being:  speak!â€

â€œbilgewater, i am the late dauphin!â€

you bet you, jim and me stared this time.  then the duke says:

â€œyou are what?â€

â€œyes, my friend, it is too true--your eyes is lookinâ€™ at this very moment
on the pore disappeared dauphin, looy the seventeen, son of looy the
sixteen and marry antonette.â€

â€œyou!  at your age!  no!  you mean youâ€™re the late charlemagne; you must
be six or seven hundred years old, at the very least.â€

well, he cried and took on so that me and jim didnâ€™t know hardly what to
do, we was so sorry--and so glad and proud weâ€™d got him with us, too.
 so we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort
_him_. but he said it warnâ€™t no use, nothing but to be dead and done
with it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel
easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his
rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him
â€œyour majesty,â€ and waited on him firs

in his presence till he asked them. so jim and me set to majestying him,
and doing this and that and tâ€™other for him, and standing up till he
told us we might set down.  this done him heaps of good, and so he
got cheerful and comfortable.  but the duke kind of soured on him, and
didnâ€™t look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still,
the king acted real friendly towards him, and said the dukeâ€™s
great-grandfather and all the other dukes of bilgewater was a good
deal thought of by _his_ father, and was allowed to come to t

it ainâ€™t your fault you warnâ€™t born a king--so whatâ€™s the use to worry?
 make the best oâ€™ things the way you find â€˜em, says i--thatâ€™s my motto.
 this ainâ€™t no bad thing that weâ€™ve struck here--plenty grub and an easy
life--come, give us your hand, duke, and leâ€™s all be friends.â€

the duke done it, and jim and me was pretty glad to see it.  it took
away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because
it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the
raft; for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody
to be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.

it didnâ€™t take me long to make up my mind that these liars warnâ€™t no
kings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds.  but i

wanted us to call them kings and dukes, i hadnâ€™t no objections, â€˜long as
it would keep peace in the family; and it warnâ€™t no use to tell jim, so
i didnâ€™t tell him.  if i never learnt nothing else out of pap, i learnt
that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them
have their own way.

they asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we
covered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of
running--was jim a runaway nigger?  says i:

â€œgoodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run _south_?â€

no, they allowed he wouldnâ€™t.  i had to account for things some way, s

i says:

â€œmy folks was living in pike county, in missouri, where i was born, and
they all died off but me and pa and my brother ike.  pa, he â€˜lowed
heâ€™d break up and go down and live with uncle ben, whoâ€™s got a little
one-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below orleans.  pa was
pretty poor, and had some debts; so when heâ€™d squared up there warnâ€™t
nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, jim.  that warnâ€™t
enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way.
 well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched
this piece of a raft; so we reckoned weâ€™d go down to orleans on it.
 paâ€™s luck didnâ€™t hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of
the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel;
jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and ike was only four
years old, so they never come up no more.  well, for

the next day or
two we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in
skiffs and trying to take jim away from me, saying they believed he was
a runaway nigger.  we donâ€™t run daytimes no more now; nights they donâ€™t
bother us.â€

the duke says:

â€œleave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we
want to.  iâ€™ll think the thing over--iâ€™ll invent a plan thatâ€™ll fix it.
weâ€™ll let it alone for to-day, because of course we donâ€™t want to go by
that town yonder in daylight--it mightnâ€™t be healthy.â€

towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the hea

lightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was
beginning to shiver--it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see
that.  so the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see
what the beds was like.  my bed was a straw tick better than jimâ€™s,
which was a corn-shuck tick; thereâ€™s always cobs around about in a shuck
tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry
shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it
makes such a rustling that you wake up.  well, the duke allowed he would
take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldnâ€™t.  he says:

â€œi should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that
a corn-shuck bed warnâ€™t just fitten for me to sleep on.  your grace â€˜

take the shuck bed yourself.â€

jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was
going to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when
the duke says:

â€œâ€˜tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of
oppression.  misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; i yield, i
submit; â€˜tis my fate.  i am alone in the world--let me suffer; can bear
it.â€

we got away as soon as it was good and dark.  the king told us to stand
well out towards the middle of the river, and no

um-bum--and the thunder would go rumbling
and grumbling away, and quit--and then rip comes another flash and
another sockdolager.  the waves most washed me off the raft sometimes,
but i hadnâ€™t any clothes on, and didnâ€™t mind.  we didnâ€™t have no trouble
about snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant
that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or
that and miss them.

i had the middle watch, you know, but i was pretty sleepy by that time,
so jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always
mighty good that way, jim was.  i crawled into the wigwam, but the king
and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warnâ€™t no show for
me; so i laid outside--i didnâ€™t mind the rain, because it was warm, and
the waves warnâ€™t running so high now.  about two they come up again,
though, and jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because
he reckoned they warnâ€™t high enough yet to do any harm; but he was

staken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a
regular ripper and washed me overboard.  it most killed jim a-laughing.
 he was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.

i took the watch, and jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by
the storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed
i rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the
day.

the king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him
and the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game.  then they got
tired of it, and allowed they would â€œlay out a campaign,â€ as they called
it. the duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of
little printed bills 
 
 ___________________________
 
ghtshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match.  the king was
satisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the
most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same
time, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the
king and told him to get his part by heart.

there was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and
after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run
in daylight without it being dangersome for jim; so he allowed he would
go down to the town and fix that thing.  the king allowed he would go,
too, and see if he couldnâ€™t strike something.  we was out of coffee, so
jim said i better go along with them in the canoe and get some.

when we got there there warnâ€™t nobody stirring; streets empty, and
perfectly dead and still, like sunday.  we found a sick nigger sunning
himself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warnâ€™t too young or
too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about 
 
 ___________________________
 
it was,
â€œyes, crush, cold world, this breaking heartâ€--and he left that all set
up and ready to print in the paper, and didnâ€™t charge nothing for it.
 well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said heâ€™d done a pretty
square dayâ€™s work for it.

then he showed us another little job heâ€™d printed and hadnâ€™t charged
for, because it was for us.  it had a picture of a runaway nigger with
a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and â€œ$200 rewardâ€ under it.  the
reading was all about jim, and just described him to a dot.  it said
he run away from st. jacquesâ€™ plantation, forty mile below new orleans,
last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send
him back he could have the reward and expenses.

â€œnow,â€ says the duke, â€œafter to-night we can run in the daytime if we
want to.  whenever we see anybody coming we can tie jim hand and foot
with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we
captured him up the river, and were too p

oor to travel on a steamboat,
so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down
to get the reward.  handcuffs and chains would look still better on jim,
but it wouldnâ€™t go well with the story of us being so poor.  too much
like jewelry.  ropes are the correct thing--we must preserve the unities,
as we say on the boards.â€

we all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldnâ€™t be no trouble
about running daytimes.  we judged we could make miles enough that night
to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the dukeâ€™s work in
the printing office was going to make in that little town; then we could
boom right along if we wanted to

.

we laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten
oâ€™clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didnâ€™t
hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it.

when jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says:

â€œhuck, does you reckâ€™n we gwyne to run acrost any moâ€™ kings on dis
trip?â€

â€œno,â€ i says, â€œi reckon not.â€

â€œwell,â€ says he, â€œdatâ€™s all right, den.  i doanâ€™ mine one er two kings,
but datâ€™s enough.  dis oneâ€™s powerful drunk, en de duke ainâ€™ much
better.â€

i found jim had been trying to get him to talk french, so he could hear
what it was like; but he said he had been in this country so long, and
had so

bills printed; and
after that, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was a
most uncommon lively place, for there warnâ€™t nothing but sword-fighting
and rehearsing--as the duke called it--going on all the time. one morning,
when we was pretty well down the state of arkansaw, we come in sight
of a little one-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up about
three-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of a crick which was
shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us but jim took
the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that
place for our show.

we struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there that
afternoon, and the country people was already beginning to come in, in
all kinds of old shackly wagons, and on horses. the circus would leave
before night, so our show would have a pretty good chance. the duke he
hired the court house, and we went around and stuck up our bills. they
read like this:

then we went loafing around the town. the stores and houses was most all
old shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadnâ€™t ever been painted; they
was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out of
reach of the water when the river was overflowed. the houses had little
gardens around them, but they didnâ€™t seem to raise hardly anything in

boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out
tin-ware. the fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on
at different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that
didnâ€™t generly have but one hinge--a leather one. some of the fences
had been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in
clumbusâ€™s time, like enough. there was generly hogs in the garden, and

 everybody sings out.) â€œall right, then--not a word about any sell.  go
along home, and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy.â€

next day you couldnâ€™t hear nothing around that town but how splendid
that show was.  house was jammed again that night, and we sold this
crowd the same way.  when me and the king and the duke got home to the
raft we all had a supper; and by and by, about midnight, they made jim
and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river, and
fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town.

the third night the house was crammed again--and they warnâ€™t new-comers
this time, but people that was at the show the other two nights.  i
stood by the duke at the door, and i see that every man that went in had
his pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his coat--and i see it
warnâ€™t no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight.  i smelt sickly eggs

them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that
three nights.  i never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that
before.  by and by, when they was asleep and snoring, jim says:

â€œdonâ€™t it sâ€™prise you de way dem kings carries on, huck?â€

â€œno,â€ i says, â€œit donâ€™t.â€

â€œwhy donâ€™t it, huck?â€

â€œwell, it donâ€™t, because itâ€™s in the breed.  i reckon theyâ€™re all
alike.â€

â€œbut, huck, dese kings oâ€™ ourn is reglar rapscallions; datâ€™s jist what

ainâ€™t nothing to _that_ old ram, anyway.  all i say is, kings is kings,

ornery lot. itâ€™s the way theyâ€™re raised.â€

â€œbut dis one do _smell_ so like de nation, huck.â€

â€œwell, they all do, jim.  we canâ€™t help the way a king smells; history
donâ€™t tell no way.â€

â€œnow de duke, heâ€™s a tolerble likely man in some ways.â€

â€œyes, a dukeâ€™s different.  but not very different.  this oneâ€™s
a middling hard lot for a duke.  when heâ€™s drunk there ainâ€™t no

what was the use to tell jim these warnâ€™t real kings and dukes?  it
wouldnâ€™t a done no good; and, besides, it was just as i said:  you
couldnâ€™t tell them from the real kind.

i went to sleep, and jim didnâ€™t call me when it was my turn.  he often
done that.  when i waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with
his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself.  i
didnâ€™t take notice nor let on.  i knowed what it was about.  he was
thinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was low
and homesick; because he hadnâ€™t ever been away from home before in his
life; and i do believe he cared just as much for his people as white
folks does for theirâ€™n.

 it donâ€™t seem natural, but i reckon itâ€™s so.
 he was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he judged i
was asleep, and saying, â€œpoâ€™ little â€˜lizabeth! poâ€™ little johnny! itâ€™s
mighty hard; i specâ€™ i ainâ€™t ever gwyne to see you no moâ€™, no moâ€™!â€  he
was a mighty good nigger, jim was.

chapter xxiv.

next day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in
the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the
duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns.  jim
he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldnâ€™t take but a few
hours, because it got mighty heavy a
 
 ___________________________
 
nd tiresome to him when he had to
lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope.  you see, when we left him
all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all
by himself and not tied it wouldnâ€™t look much like he was a runaway
nigger, you know. so the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay
roped all day, and heâ€™d cipher out some way to get around it.

he was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it.  he dressed
jim up in king learâ€™s outfit--it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a
white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint
and painted jimâ€™s face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead,
dull, solid blue, like a man thatâ€™s been drownded nine days.  blamed if
he warnâ€™t the horriblest looking outrage i ever see.  then the duke took
and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:

sick arab--but harmless when not out of his head.

and he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the

 lath up four or five
foot in front of the wigwam.  jim was satisfied.  he said it was a sight
better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all
over every time there was a sound.  the duke told him to make himself
free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop
out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like
a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.
 which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he
wouldnâ€™t wait for him to howl.  why

st; and now the king put hisâ€™n
on, and he told me to put mine on.  i done it, of course.  the kingâ€™s
duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy.  i never
knowed how clothes could change a body before.  why, before, he looked
like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when heâ€™d take off
his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand
and good and pious that youâ€™d say he had walked right out of the ark,
and maybe was old leviticus himself.  jim cleaned up the canoe, and i
got my paddle ready.  there was a big steamboat laying at the shore away
up under the point, about three mile above the town--been there a couple
of hours, taking on freight.  says the king:

â€œseeinâ€™ how iâ€™m dressed, i reckon maybe i better arrive down from st.
louis or cincinnati, or some other big place.  go for the steamboat,
huckleberry; weâ€™ll come down to the village on her.â€

i didnâ€™t have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride.

cubby would do for his valley--meaning me.

so mary jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was
plain but nice.  she said sheâ€™d have her frocks and a lot of other traps
took out of her room if they was in uncle harveyâ€™s way, but he said
they warnâ€™t.  the frocks was hung along the wall, and before them was
a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor.  there was an
old hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in another, and all sorts
of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room
with.  the king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for
these fixings, and so donâ€™t disturb them.  the dukeâ€™s room was pretty
small, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby.

that night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there,
and i stood behind the king and the dukeâ€™s chairs and waited on them,
and the niggers waited on the rest.  mary jane she set at the head of
the table, with susan alongside of her, and

ang, them two frauds, and iâ€™m fixed so
i got to travel with them a while longer, whether i want to or not--i
druther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town would
get me out of their claws, and iâ€™d be all right; but thereâ€™d be another
person that you donâ€™t know about whoâ€™d be in big trouble.  well, we
got to save _him_, hainâ€™t we?  of course.  well, then, we wonâ€™t blow on
them.â€

saying them words put a good idea in my head.  i see how maybe i could
get me and jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave.
but i didnâ€™t want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard
to answer questions but me; so i didnâ€™t want the plan to begin working
till pretty late to-night.  i says:

â€œmiss mary jane, iâ€™ll tell you what weâ€™ll do, and you wonâ€™t have to stay
at mr. lothropâ€™s so long, nuther.  how fur is it?â€

â€œa little short of four miles--right out in the country, back here.â€

â€œwell, that â€˜ll answer.  now you go along o

time the lightning showed me one that wasnâ€™t chained i snatched it and
shoved. it was a canoe, and warnâ€™t fastened with nothing but a rope.
 the towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the
middle of the river, but i didnâ€™t lose no time; and when i struck the
raft at last i was so fagged i would a just laid down to blow and gasp
if i could afforded it.  but i didnâ€™t.  as i sprung aboard i sung out:

â€œout with you, jim, and set her loose!  glory be to goodness, weâ€™re shut
of them!â€

jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so
full of joy; but when i glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up
in my mouth and i went overboard backwards; for i forgot he was old king
lear and a drownded a-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and
lights out of me.  but jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and
bless me, and so on, he was so glad i was back and we was shut of the

saying he
had a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry
to see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by
surprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go
of me and whispers, â€˜heel it now, or theyâ€™ll hang ye, sure!â€™ and i lit
out.  it didnâ€™t seem no good for _me_ to stay--i couldnâ€™t do nothing,
and i didnâ€™t want to be hung if i could get away.  so i never stopped
running till i found the canoe; and when i got here i told jim to hurry,
or theyâ€™d catch me and hang me yet, and said i was afeard you and the
duke wasnâ€™t alive now, and i was awful sorry, and so was jim, and was
awful glad when we see you coming; you may ask jim if i didnâ€™t.â€

jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, â€œoh,
yes, itâ€™s _mighty_ likely!â€ and shook me up again, and said he reckoned
heâ€™d drownd me.  but the duke says:

you inquire arou

nd took to his bottle for comfort,
and before long the duke tackled his bottle; and so in about a half an
hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the
lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each otherâ€™s arms.  they
both got powerful mellow, but i noticed the king didnâ€™t get mellow
enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag
again.  that made me feel easy and satisfied.  of course when they got
to snoring we had a long gabble, and i told jim everything.




chapter xxxi.

we dasnâ€™t stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along
down the river.  we was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty
long ways from home.  we begun to come to trees with spanish moss on
them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards.  it was the
first i ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and
dismal.  so now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they
begun to work the villages again.

first they don

  they tackled
missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and
a little of everything; but they couldnâ€™t seem to have no luck.  so at
last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she
floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the
half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.

and at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in
the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time.
jim and me got uneasy.  we didnâ€™t like the look of it.  we judged they
was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever.  we turned it
over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break
into somebodyâ€™s house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money
business, or something. so then we was pretty scared, and made up an
agreement that we wouldnâ€™t have nothing in the world to do with such
actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold
shak

e and clear out and leave them behind. well, early one morning we
hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit of
a shabby village named pikesville, and the king he went ashore and told
us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see
if anybody had got any wind of the royal nonesuch there yet. (â€œhouse to
rob, you _mean_,â€ says i to myself; â€œand when you get through robbing it
youâ€™ll come back here and wonder what has become of me and jim and the
raft--and youâ€™ll have to take it out in wondering.â€) and he said if he
warnâ€™t back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right, and
we was to come along.

so we stayed where we was.  the duke he fretted and sweated around, and
was in a mighty sour way.  he scolded us for everything, and we couldnâ€™t
seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing.
something was a-brewing, sure.  i was good and glad when midday come
and no king; we could have a change, a

ry, very tight, and a lot of loafers
bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all
his might, and so tight he couldnâ€™t walk, and couldnâ€™t do nothing to
them.  the duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king
begun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it i lit out and
shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like
a deer, for i see our chance; and i made up my mind that it would be a
long day before they ever see me and jim again.  i got down there all
out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:

â€œset her loose, jim! weâ€™re all right now!â€

but there warnâ€™t no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam.  jim was
gone!  i set up a shout--and then another--and then another one; and run
this way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warnâ€™t
no use--old jim was gone.  then i set down and cried; i couldnâ€™t help
it. but i couldnâ€™t set still long.  pretty soon i went out on the road,
t
 
 ___________________________
 
 no trouble â€˜bout _that_ speculation, you bet you.  say, gimme a
chaw tobacker, wonâ€™t ye?â€

i didnâ€™t have none, so he left.  i went to the raft, and set down in the
wigwam to think.  but i couldnâ€™t come to nothing.  i thought till i wore
my head sore, but i couldnâ€™t see no way out of the trouble.  after all
this long journey, and after all weâ€™d done for them scoundrels, here it
was all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined, because
they could have the heart to serve jim such a trick as that, and make
him a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too, for forty
dirty dollars.

once i said to myself it would be a thousand times better for jim to
be a slave at home where his family was, as long as heâ€™d _got_ to be a
slave, and so iâ€™d better write a letter to tom sawyer and tell him to
tell miss watson where he was.  but i soon give up that notion for two
things: sheâ€™d be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness
for leaving her, and so 
 
 ___________________________
 
sheâ€™d sell him straight down the river again;
and if she didnâ€™t, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger,
and theyâ€™d make jim feel it all the time, and so heâ€™d feel ornery and
disgraced. and then think of _me_!  it would get all around that huck
finn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if i was ever to see
anybody from that town again iâ€™d be ready to get down and lick his boots
for shame.  thatâ€™s just the way:  a person does a low-down thing, and
then he donâ€™t want to take no consequences of it. thinks as long as he
can hide it, it ainâ€™t no disgrace.  that was my fix exactly. the more i
studied about thi
 
 ___________________________
 
ep down in me i
knowed it was a lie, and he knowed it.  you canâ€™t pray a lie--i found
that out.

so i was full of trouble, full as i could be; and didnâ€™t know what to
do. at last i had an idea; and i says, iâ€™ll go and write the letter--and
then see if i can pray.  why, it was astonishing, the way i felt as
light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone.  so i
got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down
and wrote:

miss watson, your runaway nigger jim is down here two mile below
pikesville, and mr. phelps has got him and he will give him up for the
reward if you send.

_huck finn._

i felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time i had ever
felt so in my life, and i knowed i could pray now.  but i didnâ€™t do it
straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking
how good it was all this happened so, and how near i come to being lost
and going to hell.  and went on thinking.  and got to thinking over our
trip do

wn the river; and i see jim before me all the time:  in the day
and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we
a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing.  but somehow i
couldnâ€™t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the
other kind.  iâ€™d see him standing my watch on top of hisâ€™n, â€˜stead of
calling me, so i could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when
i come back out of the fog; and when i come to him again in the swamp,
up there where the feud was; and

such-like times; and would always call
me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how
good he always was; and at last i struck the time i saved him by telling
the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said i was
the best friend old jim ever had in the world, and the _only_ one heâ€™s
got now; and then i happened to look around and see that paper.

it was a close place.  i took it up, and held it in my hand.  i was
a-trembling, because iâ€™d got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and
i knowed it.  i studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then
says to myself:

â€œall right, then, iâ€™ll _go_ to hellâ€--and tore it up.

it was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said.  and i let
them stay said; and never
 
 ___________________________
 
 thought no more about reforming.  i shoved the
whole thing out of my head, and said i would take up wickedness again,
which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warnâ€™t.  and
for a starter i would go to work and steal jim out of slavery again;
and if i could think up anything worse, i would do that, too; because as
long as i was in, and in for good, i might as well go the whole hog.

then i set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some
considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that
suited me.  so then i took the bearings of a woody island that was down
the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark i crept out with my
raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turne
 
 ___________________________
 
t.  we never got him till dark; then we
fetched him over, and i started down for the raft.  when i got there and
see it was gone, i says to myself, â€˜theyâ€™ve got into trouble and had to
leave; and theyâ€™ve took my nigger, which is the only nigger iâ€™ve got in
the world, and now iâ€™m in a strange country, and ainâ€™t got no property
no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;â€™ so i set down and
cried.  i slept in the woods all night.  but what _did_ become of the
raft, then?--and jim--poor jim!â€

â€œblamed if i know--that is, whatâ€™s become of the raft.  that old fool had
made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery
the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but
what heâ€™d spent for whisky; and when i got him home late last night and
found the raft gone, we said, â€˜that little rascal has stole our raft and
shook us, and run off down the river.â€™â€

â€œi wouldnâ€™t shake my _nigger_, would i?--the only nigger i had in

this
very afternoon.â€

â€œno you wont, youâ€™ll start _now_; and donâ€™t you lose any time about it,
neither, nor do any gabbling by the way.  just keep a tight tongue in
your head and move right along, and then you wonâ€™t get into trouble with
_us_, dâ€™ye hear?â€

that was the order i wanted, and that was the one i played for.  i
wanted to be left free to work my plans.

â€œso clear out,â€ he says; â€œand you can tell mr. foster whatever you want
to. maybe you can get him to believe that jim _is_ your nigger--some
idiots donâ€™t require documents--leastways iâ€™ve heard thereâ€™s such down
south here.  and when you tell him the handbill and the rewardâ€™s bogus,
maybe heâ€™ll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for
getting â€˜em out.  go â€˜long now, and tell him anything you want to; but
mind you donâ€™t work your jaw any _between_ here and there.â€

so i left, and struck for the back country.  i didnâ€™t look around, but i
kinder felt like he was watching me.  
 
 ___________________________
 
but i knowed i could tire him out
at that.  i went straight out in the country as much as a mile before
i stopped; then i doubled back through the woods towards phelpsâ€™.  i
reckoned i better start in on my plan straight off without fooling
around, because i wanted to stop jimâ€™s mouth till these fellows could
get away.  i didnâ€™t want no trouble with their kind.  iâ€™d seen all i
wanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them.




chapter xxxii.

when i got there it was all still and sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny;
the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint
dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and
like everybodyâ€™s dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers
the leaves it makes you f

itâ€™s yourâ€™n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to the
house about the time you ought to; and iâ€™ll go towards town a piece, and
take a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you;
and you neednâ€™t let on to know me at first.â€

i says:

â€œall right; but wait a minute.  thereâ€™s one more thing--a thing that
_nobody_ donâ€™t know but me.  and that is, thereâ€™s a nigger here that
iâ€™m a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his name is _jim_--old miss
watsonâ€™s jim.â€

he says:

what if it is?  iâ€™m low down; and iâ€™m a-going to steal him, and i want
you keep mum and not let on.  will you?â€

his eye lit up, and he says:

â€œiâ€™ll _help_ you steal him!â€

well, i let go all holts then, like i was shot.  it was the most
astonishing speech i ever heard--and iâ€™m bound to say t

antation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a church
and schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and it was
worth it, too.  there was plenty other farmer-preachers like that, and
done the same way, down south.

in about half an hour tomâ€™s wagon drove up to the front stile, and aunt
sally she see it through the window, because it was only about fifty
yards, and says:

â€œwhy, thereâ€™s somebody come!  i wonder who â€˜tis?  why, i do believe itâ€™s
a stranger.  jimmyâ€ (thatâ€™s one of the children) â€œrun and tell lize to
put on another plate for dinner.â€

everybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger
donâ€™t come _every_ year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, for
interest, when he does come.  tom was over the stile and starting for
the house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we
was all bunched in the front door.  tom had his store clothes on, and an
audience--and that was always nuts for tom sawy

bed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down the
lightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for i didnâ€™t believe anybody was
going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if i didnâ€™t hurry up
and give them one theyâ€™d get into trouble sure.

on the road tom he told me all about how it was reckoned i was murdered,
and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didnâ€™t come back no more, and
what a stir there was when jim run away; and i told tom all about our
royal nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as i had
time to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of
it--it was as much as half-after eight, then--here comes a raging rush of
people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin
pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by;
and as they went by i see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a
rail--that is, i knowed it _was

chapter xxxiv.

we stopped talking, and got to thinking.  by and by tom says:

â€œlooky here, huck, what fools we are to not think of it before!  i bet i
know where jim is.â€

â€œno!  where?â€

â€œin that hut down by the ash-hopper.  why, looky here.  when we was at
dinner, didnâ€™t you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œwhat did you think the vittles was for?â€

â€œfor a dog.â€

â€œso â€˜d i. well, it wasnâ€™t for a dog.â€

â€œwhy?â€

â€œbecause part of it was watermelon.â€

â€œso it was--i noticed it.  well, it does beat all that i never thought
about a dog not eating watermelon.  it shows how a body can see and

 see at the same time.â€

â€œwell, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it
again when he came out.  he fetched uncle a key about the time we got up
from table--same key, i bet.  watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner;
and it ainâ€™t likely thereâ€™s two prisoners on such a little plantation,
and where the peopleâ€™s all so kind and good.  jimâ€™s the prisoner.  all
right--iâ€™m glad we found it out detective fashion; i wouldnâ€™t give shucks
for any other way.  now you work your mind, and study out a plan to
steal jim, and i will study out one, too; and weâ€™ll take the one we like
the best.â€

what a head for just a boy to have!  if i had tom sawyerâ€™s head i
wouldnâ€™t trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown
in a circus, nor nothing i can think of.  i went to thinking out a plan,
but only just to be doing s

omething; i knowed very well where the right
plan was going to come from.  pretty soon tom says:

â€œready?â€

â€œyes,â€ i says.

â€œall right--bring it out.â€

â€œmy plan is this,â€ i says.  â€œwe can easy find out if itâ€™s jim in there.
then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the
island.  then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the
old manâ€™s britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river
on the raft with jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and
jim used to do before.  wouldnâ€™t that plan work?â€

â€œ_work_?  why, certâ€™nly it would work, like rats a-fighting.  but itâ€™s
too blameâ€™ simple; there ainâ€™t nothing _to_ it.  whatâ€™s the good of a
plan that ainâ€™t no more trouble than that?  itâ€™s as mild as goose-milk.
 why, huck, it wouldnâ€™t make no more talk than breaking into a soap
factory.â€

i never said nothing, because i warnâ€™t expecting nothing different; but

and it didnâ€™t.  he told me what it was, and i see in a minute it was
worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make jim just as free a man
as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides.  so i was satisfied,
and said we would waltz in on it.  i neednâ€™t tell what it was here,
because i knowed it wouldnâ€™t stay the way, it was.  i knowed he would be
changing it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new
bullinesses wherever he got a chance.  and that is what he done.

well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that tom sawyer was in
earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger o

o examine it.  we went through the yard
so as to see what the hounds would do.  they knowed us, and didnâ€™t make
no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by
in the night.  when we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and
the two sides; and on the side i warnâ€™t acquainted with--which was the
north side--we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just
one stout board nailed across it.  i says:

â€œhereâ€™s the ticket.  this holeâ€™s big enough for jim to get through if we
wrench off the board.â€

tom says:

â€œitâ€™s as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as
playing hooky.  i should _hope_ we can find a way thatâ€™s a little more
complicated than _that_, huck finn.â€

â€œwell, then,â€ i says, â€œhow â€˜ll it do to saw him out, the way i done
before i was murdered that time?â€

â€œthatâ€™s more _like_,â€ he says.  â€œitâ€™s real mysterious, and troublesome,
and good,â€ he says; â€œbut i bet we can find a way thatâ€™s twic

antical enough for tom sawyer; no way would do him but he must
climb up the lightning-rod.  but after he got up half way about three
times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most
busted his brains out, he thought heâ€™d got to give it up; but after he
was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this
time he made the trip.

in the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins
to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed jim--if it
_was_ jim that was being fed.  the niggers was just getting through
breakfast and starting for the fields; and jimâ€™s nigger was piling up
a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was
leaving, the key come from the house.

this nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was
all tied up in little bunches with thread.  that was to keep witches
off.  he said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and
making him see all kinds of strange th

 nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you
heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:

â€œyes, mars sid, a dog.  curâ€™us dog, too.  does you want to go en look at
â€˜im?â€

â€œyes.â€

i hunched tom, and whispers:

â€œyou going, right here in the daybreak?  _that_ warnâ€™t the plan.â€

â€œno, it warnâ€™t; but itâ€™s the plan _now_.â€

so, drat him, we went along, but i didnâ€™t like it much.  when we got in
we couldnâ€™t hardly see anything, it was so dark; but jim was there, sure
enough, and could see us; and he sings out:

â€œwhy, _huck_!  en good _lan_â€™! ainâ€™ dat misto tom?â€

i just knowed how it would be; i just expected it.  i didnâ€™t know
nothing to do; and if i had i couldnâ€™t a done it, because that nigger
busted in and says:

â€œwhy, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?â€

we could see pretty well now.  tom he looked at the nigger, steady and
kind of wondering, and says:

â€œdoes _who_ know us?â€

â€œwhy, dis-yer runaway nigger.â€

 he does; but what put that into your head?â€

â€œwhat _put_ it dar?  didnâ€™ he jisâ€™ dis minute sing out like he knowed
you?â€

tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:

â€œwell, thatâ€™s mighty curious.  _who_ sung out? _when_ did he sing out?
 _what_ did he sing out?â€ and turns to me, perfectly caâ€™m, and says,
â€œdid _you_ hear anybody sing out?â€

of course there warnâ€™t nothing to be said but the one thing; so i says:

â€œno; i ainâ€™t heard nobody say nothing.â€

then he turns to jim, and looks him over like he never see him before,
and says:

â€œdid you sing out?â€

â€œno, sah,â€ says jim; â€œi hainâ€™t said nothing, sah.â€

â€œnot a word?â€

â€œno, sah, i hainâ€™t said a word.â€

â€œdid you ever see us before?â€

â€œno, sah; not as i knows on.â€

so tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and
says, kind of severe:

â€œwhat do you reckonâ€™s the matter with you, anyway?  what made you think
somebody sung out?â€

â€œoh, itâ€™s de dad-blameâ€™

tom give him a dime, and said we wouldnâ€™t tell nobody; and told him to
buy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at jim, and
says:

â€œi wonder if uncle silas is going to hang this nigger.  if i was to
catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, i wouldnâ€™t give
him up, iâ€™d hang him.â€  and whilst the nigger stepped to the door to
look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to jim
and says:

â€œdonâ€™t ever let on to know us.  and if you hear any digging going on
nights, itâ€™s us; weâ€™re going to set you free.â€

jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then

to rest, and tom says, kind of dissatisfied:

â€œblame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be.
and so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan.
 there ainâ€™t no watchman to be drugged--now there _ought_ to be a
watchman.  there ainâ€™t even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to.  and
thereâ€™s jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his
bed:  why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off
the chain.  and uncle silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the
punkin-headed nigger, and donâ€™t send nobody to watch the nigger.  jim
could a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldnâ€™t be
no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg.  why, drat it,

â€œwhat do we want of a moat when weâ€™re going to snake him out from under
the cabin?â€

but he never heard me.  he had forgot me and everything else.  he had
his chin in his hand, thinking.  pretty soon he sighs and shakes his
head; then sighs again, and says:

â€œno, it wouldnâ€™t do--there ainâ€™t necessity enough for it.â€

â€œfor what?â€  i says.

â€œwhy, to saw jimâ€™s leg off,â€ he says.

â€œgood land!â€  i says; â€œwhy, there ainâ€™t _no_ necessity for it.  and what
would you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?â€

â€œwell, some of the best authorities has done it.  they couldnâ€™t get the
chain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved.  and a leg would
be better still.  but we got to let that go.  there ainâ€™t necessity
enough in this case; and, besides, jimâ€™s a nigger, and wouldnâ€™t

our sheets to make jim a rope ladder, weâ€™re going to get into trouble
with aunt sally, just as sure as youâ€™re born.  now, the way i look at
it, a hickry-bark ladder donâ€™t cost nothing, and donâ€™t waste nothing,
and is just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick,
as any rag ladder you can start; and as for jim, he ainâ€™t had no

he said that would do.  and that gave him another idea, and he says:

â€œborrow a shirt, too.â€

â€œwhat do we want of a shirt, tom?â€

â€œwant it for jim to keep a journal on.â€

when i stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he
made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it
was for. tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we
_needed_. well, i says, i needed the watermelon.  but he said i didnâ€™t
need it to get out of prison with; thereâ€™s where the difference was.
 he said if iâ€™d a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to jim
to kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right.  so i let it go at
that, though i couldnâ€™t see no advantage in my representing a prisoner
if i got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like
that every time i see a chance to hog a watermelon.

 heâ€™ll hear jim ainâ€™t from there.  then his next move will be to
advertise jim, or something like that.  so we canâ€™t resk being as long
digging him out as we ought to.  by rights i reckon we ought to be
a couple of years; but we canâ€™t.  things being so uncertain, what i
recommend is this:  that we really dig right in, as quick as we can;
and after that, we can _let on_, to ourselves, that we was at it
thirty-seven years.  then we can snatch him out and rush him away the

chapter xxxvi.

as soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the
lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our
pile of fox-fire, and went to work.  we cleared everything out of the
way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log.  tom
said he was right behind jimâ€™s bed now, and weâ€™d dig in under it, and
when we got through there couldnâ€™t nobody in the cabin ever know there
was any hole there, because jimâ€™s counter-pin hung down most to the
ground, and youâ€™d have to raise it up and look under to see the hole.
 so we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then
we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldnâ€™t see
weâ€™d done anything hardly.  at last i says:

â€œthis ainâ€™t no thirty-seven year job; this is

â€œwell,â€ he says, â€œthereâ€™s excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like
this; if it warnâ€™t so, i wouldnâ€™t approve of it, nor i wouldnâ€™t stand by
and see the rules broke--because right is right, and wrong is wrong,
and a body ainâ€™t got no business doing wrong when he ainâ€™t ignorant and
knows better.  it might answer for _you_ to dig jim out with a pick,
_without_ any letting on, because you donâ€™t know no better; but it
wouldnâ€™t for me, because i do know better.  gimme a case-knife.â€

he had his own by him, but i handed him mine.  he flung it down, and
says:

â€œgimme a _case-knife_.â€

i didnâ€™t know just what to do--but then i thought.  i scratched around
amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took
it and went to work, and never said a word.

he was always just that particular.  full of pr

t up stairs i looked out at the window and see tom doing
his level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldnâ€™t come it, his
hands was so sore.  at last he says:

â€œit ainâ€™t no use, it canâ€™t be done.  what you reckon i better do?  canâ€™t
you think of no way?â€

â€œyes,â€ i says, â€œbut i reckon it ainâ€™t regular.  come up the stairs, and
let on itâ€™s a lightning-rod.â€

so he done it.

next day tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,
for to make some pens for jim out of, and six tallow candles; and i
hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin
plates.  tom says it wasnâ€™t enough; but i said nobody wouldnâ€™t ever see
the plates that jim throwed out, because theyâ€™d fall in the dog-fennel
and jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we could tote them back and
he could use them over again.  so tom was satisfied.  then he says:

â€œnow, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to jim.â€

â€œtake them in through the
 
 ___________________________
 
 hole,â€ i says, â€œwhen we get it done.â€

he only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard
of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying.  by and by he
said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warnâ€™t no need to
decide on any of them yet.  said weâ€™d got to post jim first.

that night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took
one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard
jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didnâ€™t wake him.  then we
whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half
the job was done.  we crept in under jimâ€™s bed and into the cabin, and
pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over jim awhile,
and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle
and gradual.  he was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us
honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us

p a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away,
and clearing out without losing any time.  but tom he showed him how
unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans,
and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and
not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_.
 so jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old
times awhile, and then tom asked a lot of questions, and when jim told
him uncle silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and aunt
sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and
both of them was kind as they could be, tom says:

â€œ_now_ i know how to fix it.  weâ€™ll send you some things by them.â€

i said, â€œdonâ€™t do nothing of the kind; itâ€™s one of the most jackass
ideas i ever struck;â€ but he never paid no attention to me; went right
on.  it was his way when heâ€™d got his plans set.

so he told jim how weâ€™d have t

large things by nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the
lookout, and not be surprised, and not let nat see him open them; and
we would put small things in uncleâ€™s coat-pockets and he must steal them
out; and we would tie things to auntâ€™s apron-strings or put them in her
apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and
what they was for.  and told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with
his blood, and all that. he told him everything.  jim he couldnâ€™t see
no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed
better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just
as tom said.

jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good
sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to
bed, with hands that looked like theyâ€™d been chawed.  tom was in high
spirits. he said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the
most intellectural; and said if he only co

uld see his way to it we would
keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave jim to our children to
get out; for he believed jim would come to like it better and better the
more he got used to it.  he said that in that way it could be strung out
to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record.  and he
said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.

in the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass
candlestick into handy sizes, and tom put them and the pewter spoon in
his pocket.  then we went to the nigger cabins, and while i got natâ€™s
notice off, tom shoved a piece of can

dlestick into the middle of a
corn-pone that was in jimâ€™s pan, and we went along with nat to see how
it would work, and it just worked noble; when jim bit into it it most
mashed all his teeth out; and there warnâ€™t ever anything could a worked
better. tom said so himself. jim he never let on but what it was only
just a piece of rock or something like that thatâ€™s always getting into
bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he
jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.

and whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a
couple of the hounds bulging in from under jimâ€™s bed; and they kept on
piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warnâ€™t hardly room
in there to get your breath.  by jings, we forgo

over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was
dying.  tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of jimâ€™s meat,
and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back
again and shut the door, and i knowed heâ€™d fixed the other door too.
then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and
asking him if heâ€™d been imagining he saw something again.  he raised up,
and blinked his eyes around, and says:

â€œmars sid, youâ€™ll say iâ€™s a fool, but if i didnâ€™t bâ€™lieve i see most a

i will!â€

â€œall right, iâ€™ll do it, seeing itâ€™s you, and youâ€™ve been good to us and
showed us the runaway nigger.  but you got to be mighty careful.  when
we come around, you turn your back; and then whatever weâ€™ve put in the
pan, donâ€™t you let on you see it at all.  and donâ€™t you look when jim
unloads the pan--something might happen, i donâ€™t know what.  and above
all, donâ€™t you _handle_ the witch-things.â€

of bottles, and wore-out tin things, a

to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they

up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat

we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner sheâ€™d skin
us.  so we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst
she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and jim got it all right, along
with her shingle nail, before noon.  we was very well satisfied with
this business, and tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took,
because he said _now_ she couldnâ€™t ever count them spoons twice alike
again to save her life; and wouldnâ€™t believe sheâ€™d counted them right if
she _did_; and said that after sheâ€™d about counted her head off for the
next three days he judged sheâ€™d give it up and offer to kill anybody
that wanted her to ever count them any mo

cooked it there; and we got it
done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we
had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and
we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with
the smoke; because, you see, we didnâ€™t want nothing but a crust, and we
couldnâ€™t prop it up right, and she would always cave in.  but of course
we thought of the right way at last--which was to cook the ladder, too,
in the pie.  so then we laid in with jim the second night, and tore
up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long
before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person
with.  we let on it took nine months to make it.

and in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldnâ€™t go
into the pie.  being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope
enough for forty pies if weâ€™d a wanted them, and plenty left over
for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose.  we could a had a whole

lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long
handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a
pie that was a satisfaction to look at. but the person that et it would
want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope
ladder wouldnâ€™t cramp him down to business i donâ€™t know nothing what iâ€™m
talking about, and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next
time, too.

nat didnâ€™t look when we put the witch pie in jimâ€™s pan; and we put the
three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so jim
got everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he busted
into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick,
and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the
window-hole.




chapter xxxviii.

making them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and jim
allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all.  thatâ€™s the
one which the prisoner
 
 ___________________________
 
 has to scrabble on the wall.  but he had to have
it; tom said heâ€™d _got_ to; there warnâ€™t no case of a state prisoner not
scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.

â€œlook at lady jane grey,â€ he says; â€œlook at gilford dudley; look at old
northumberland!  why, huck, sâ€™pose it _is_ considerble trouble?--what
you going to do?--how you going to get around it?  jimâ€™s _got_ to do his
inscription and coat of arms.  they all do.â€

jim says:

â€œwhy, mars tom, i hainâ€™t got no coat oâ€™ arm; i hainâ€™t got nuffn but dish
yer ole shirt, en you knows i got to keep de journal on dat.â€

â€œoh, you donâ€™t understand, jim; a coat of arms is very different.â€

â€œwell,â€ i says, â€œjimâ€™s right, anyway, when he says he ainâ€™t got no coat
of arms, because he hainâ€™t.â€

â€œi reckon i knowed that,â€ tom says, â€œbut you bet heâ€™ll have one before
he goes out of this--because heâ€™s going out _right_, and there ainâ€™t

so whilst me and jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, jim
a-making hisâ€™n out of the brass and i making mine out of the spoon,
tom set to work to think out the coat of arms.  by and by he said heâ€™d
struck so many good ones he didnâ€™t hardly know which to take, but there
was one which he reckoned heâ€™d decide on.  he says:

â€œon the scutcheon weâ€™ll have a bend _or_ in the dexter base, a saltire
_murrey_ in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under
his foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron _vert_ in a

shucks, tom,â€ i says, â€œi think you might tell a person.  whatâ€™s a bar
sinister?â€

â€œoh, i donâ€™t know.  but heâ€™s got to have it.  all the nobility does.â€

that was just his way.  if it didnâ€™t suit him to explain a thing to you,
he wouldnâ€™t do it.  you might pump at him a week, it wouldnâ€™t make no
difference.

heâ€™d got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in to
finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a
mournful inscription--said jim got to have one, like they all done.  he
made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so:

1.  here a captive heart busted. 2.  here a poor prisoner, forsook by
the world and friends, fretted his sorrowful life. 3.  here a lonely
heart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after thirty-seven
years of solitary captivity. 4.  here, homeless and friendless, after
thirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger,
natural son of louis xiv.

mbled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down.
when he got done he couldnâ€™t no way make up his mind which one for jim
to scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he allowed
he would let him scrabble them all on.  jim said it would take him a
year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail, and he
didnâ€™t know how to make letters, besides; but tom said he would block
them out for him, and then he wouldnâ€™t have nothing to do but just
follow the lines.  then pretty soon he says:

â€œcome to think, the logs ainâ€™t a-going to do; they donâ€™t have log walls
in a dungeon:  we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock.  weâ€™ll fetch
a rock.â€

jim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said 
 
 ___________________________
 
it would take him
such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldnâ€™t ever get out.
 but tom said he would let me help him do it.  then he took a look to
see how me and jim was getting along with the pens.  it was most pesky
tedious hard work and slow, and didnâ€™t give my hands no show to get
well of the sores, and we didnâ€™t seem to make no headway, hardly; so tom
says:

â€œi know how to fix it.  we got to have a rock for the coat of arms and
mournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock.
thereâ€™s a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and weâ€™ll smouch it,
and carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it,
too.â€


 
 ___________________________
 
it warnâ€™t no slouch of an idea; and it warnâ€™t no slouch of a grindstone
nuther; but we allowed weâ€™d tackle it.  it warnâ€™t quite midnight yet,
so we cleared out for the mill, leaving jim at work.  we smouched the
grindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was a most nation tough
job. sometimes, do what we could, we couldnâ€™t keep her from falling
over, and she come mighty near mashing us every time.  tom said she was
going to get one of us, sure, before we got through.  we got her half
way; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat.  we
see it warnâ€™t no use; we got to go and fetch jim. so he raised up his
bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, 
 
 ___________________________
 
and wrapt it round and round
his neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and jim
and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing; and
tom superintended.  he could out-superintend any boy i ever see.  he
knowed how to do everything.

our hole was pretty big, but it warnâ€™t big enough to get the grindstone
through; but jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough.  then tom
marked out them things on it with the nail, and set jim to work on them,
with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the
lean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his candle
quit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under
his straw tick and sleep on it.  then we helped him fix his chain back
on the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves.  but tom thought of
something, and says:

â€œyou got any spiders in here, jim?â€

â€œno, sah, thanks to goodness i hainâ€™t, mars tom.â€

â€œall righ

tom thought a minute or two, and says:

â€œitâ€™s a good idea.  and i reckon itâ€™s been done.  it _must_ a been done;
it stands to reason.  yes, itâ€™s a prime good idea.  where could you keep
it?â€

â€œkeep what, mars tom?â€

â€œwhy, a rattlesnake.â€

â€œde goodness gracious alive, mars tom!  why, if dey was a rattlesnake to
come in heah iâ€™d take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, i would, wid
my head.â€

â€œwhy, jim, you wouldnâ€™t be afraid of it after a little.  you could tame
it.â€

â€œ_tame_ it!â€

â€œyes--easy enough.  every animal is grateful for kindness and petting,
and they wouldnâ€™t _think_ of hurting a person that pets them.  any book
will tell you that.  you try--thatâ€™s all i ask; just try for two or three
days. why, you can get him so, in a little while, that heâ€™ll love you;
and sleep with you; and wonâ€™t stay away from you a minute; and will let

â€œjim, donâ€™t act so foolish.  a prisonerâ€™s _got_ to have some kind of a
dumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hainâ€™t ever been tried, why, thereâ€™s more
glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other
way you could ever think of to save your life.â€

â€œwhy, mars tom, i doanâ€™ _want_ no sich glory.  snake take â€˜n bite

â€œwell, it _always_ is when itâ€™s done right.  you got any rats around

â€œwell, weâ€™ll get you some rats.â€

â€œwhy, mars tom, i doanâ€™ _want_ no rats.  deyâ€™s de dadblamedest creturs

â€œbut, jim, you _got_ to have â€˜em--they all do.  so donâ€™t make no more
fuss about it.  prisoners ainâ€™t ever without rats.  there ainâ€™t no
instance of it.  and they train them, and pet them, and learn them
tricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies.  but you got to play

â€œi ainâ€™ got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece oâ€™ paper, en a juice-harp;

else; and when youâ€™ve played about two minutes youâ€™ll see all the rats,
and the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you,
and come.  and theyâ€™ll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good

pretty soon he says:

so tom was stumped.  but he studied it over, and then said jim would
have to worry along the best he could with an onion.  he promised
he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in jimâ€™s
coffee-pot, in the morning. jim said he would â€œjisâ€™ â€˜s soon have

work and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and
petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of
all the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals,

be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that tom most lost all
patience with him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier
chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for
himself, and yet he didnâ€™t know enough to appreciate them, and they was
just about wasted on him.  so jim he was sorry, and said he wouldnâ€™t
behave so no more, and then me and tom shoved for bed.




chapter xxxix.

in the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and
fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour
we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put
it in a safe place under aunt sallyâ€™s bed.  but while we was gone for
spiders little thomas franklin benjamin jefferson elexander phelps found
it there, and opened the d

other.

we got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she
allowed these lickings warnâ€™t nothing to what she would do if we ever
loaded up the place again with them.  i didnâ€™t mind the lickings,
because they didnâ€™t amount to nothing; but i minded the trouble we
had to lay in another lot.  but we got them laid in, and all the other
things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as jimâ€™s was when theyâ€™d
all swarm out for music and go for him.  jim didnâ€™t like the spiders,
and the spiders didnâ€™t like jim; and so theyâ€™d lay for him, and make it
mighty warm for him.  and he said that between the rats and the snakes
and the grindstone there warnâ€™t no room in bed for him, skasely; and
when there was, a body couldnâ€™t sleep, it was so lively, and it was
always lively, he said, because _they_ never all slept at one time, but
took turn about, so when the snakes was aslee

p the rats was on deck, and
when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one
gang under him, in his way, and tâ€™other gang having a circus over him,
and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at
him as he crossed over. he said if he ever got out this time he wouldnâ€™t
ever be a prisoner again, not for a salary.

well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.
 the shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit jim he
would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh;
the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the
grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust,
and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache.  we reckoned we was all
going to die, but didnâ€™t.  it was the most undigestible sawdust i ever
see; and tom said the same.

but as i was saying, weâ€™d got all the work done now, at last; and we was

plantation; so he allowed he would advertise jim in the st. louis and
new orleans papers; and when he mentioned the st. louis ones it give me
the cold shivers, and i see we hadnâ€™t no time to lose. so tom said, now
for the nonnamous letters.

â€œwhatâ€™s them?â€  i says.

â€œwarnings to the people that something is up.  sometimes itâ€™s done one
way, sometimes another.  but thereâ€™s always somebody spying around that

â€œall right, then, iâ€™ll do it; but i could carry it just as handy in my

â€œyou wouldnâ€™t look like a servant-girl _then_, would you?â€

â€œno, but there wonâ€™t be nobody to see what i look like, _anyway_.â€

â€œthat ainâ€™t got nothing to do with it.  the thing for us to do is just
to do our _duty_, and not worry about whether anybody _sees_ us do it or
not. hainâ€™t you got no principle at all?â€

â€œall right, i ainâ€™t saying nothing; iâ€™m the servant-girl.  whoâ€™s jimâ€™s
mother?â€

â€œiâ€™m his mother.  iâ€™ll hook a gown from aunt sally.â€

â€œwell, then, youâ€™ll have to stay in the cabin when me and jim leaves.â€

â€œnot much.  iâ€™ll stuff jimâ€™s clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed
to represent his mother in disguise, and jim â€˜ll take the nigger womanâ€™s
gown off of me and wear it, and weâ€™ll all evade together.  when a

even, and tom put on aunt sallyâ€™s dress that he stole and
was going to start with the lunch, but says:

â€œwhereâ€™s the butter?â€

â€œi laid out a hunk of it,â€ i says, â€œon a piece of a corn-pone.â€

â€œwell, you _left_ it laid out, then--it ainâ€™t here.â€

â€œwe can get along without it,â€ i says.

â€œwe can get along _with_ it, too,â€ he says; â€œjust you slide down cellar
and fetch it.  and then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come
along. iâ€™ll go and stuff the straw into jimâ€™s clothes to represent his
mother in disguise, and be ready to _baa_ like a sheep and shove soon as
you get there.â€

so out he went, and down cellar went i. the hunk of butter, big as
a personâ€™s fist, was where i had left it, so i took up the slab of
corn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs
very stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes
aunt sally with a candle, and i clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped
my hat on my head, and the nex

i did wish aunt sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if
she wanted to, and let me get away and tell tom how weâ€™d overdone this
thing, and what a thundering hornetâ€™s-nest weâ€™d got ourselves into, so
we could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with jim before
these rips got out of patience and come for us.

at last she come and begun to ask me questions, but i _couldnâ€™t_ answer
them straight, i didnâ€™t know which end of me was up; because these men
was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right now and
lay for them desperadoes, and saying it warnâ€™t but a few minutes to
midnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the
sheep-signal; and here was aunty pegging away at the questions, and
me a-shaking all

n the lightning-rod in another one,
and shinning through the dark for the lean-to.  i couldnâ€™t hardly get my
words out, i was so anxious; but i told tom as quick as i could we must
jump for it now, and not a minute to lose--the house full of men, yonder,
with guns!

his eyes just blazed; and he says:

â€œno!--is that so?  _ainâ€™t_ it bully!  why, huck, if it was to do over
again, i bet i could fetch two hundred!  if we could put it off till--â€

â€œhurry!  _hurry_!â€  i says.  â€œwhereâ€™s jim?â€

â€œright at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him.
 heâ€™s dressed, and everythingâ€™s ready.  now weâ€™ll slide out and give the
sheep-signal.â€

but then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them
begin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:

â€œi _told_ you weâ€™d be too soon; they havenâ€™t come--the door is locked.
here, iâ€™ll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for â€˜em in the
dark and kill â€˜em when they come; and the rest

so in they come, but couldnâ€™t see us in the dark, and most trod on
us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed.  but we got under all
right, and out through the hole, swift but soft--jim first, me next,
and tom last, which was according to tomâ€™s orders.  now we was in the
lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside.  so we crept to the door,
and tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldnâ€™t make
out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen
for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us jim must glide out
first, and him last.  so he set his ear to the crack and listened, and
listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping arou

the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down,
not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy
towards the fence in injun file, and got to it all right, and me and jim
over it; but tomâ€™s britches catched fast on a splinter on the top
rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which
snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks
and started somebody sings out:

â€œwhoâ€™s that?  answer, or iâ€™ll shoot!â€

but we didnâ€™t answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved.  then there
was a rush, and a _bang, bang, bang!_ and the bullets fairly whizzed
around us! we heard them sing out:

â€œhere they are!  theyâ€™ve

till we was nearly
to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was
tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the
river, but didnâ€™t make no more noise than we was obleeged to. then we
struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and
we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the
bank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out.  and when
we stepped on to the raft i says:

â€œ_now_, old jim, youâ€™re a free man again, and i bet you wonâ€™t ever be a
slave no more.â€

â€œen a mighty good job it wuz, too, huck.  it â€˜uz planned beautiful, en
it â€˜uz done beautiful; en dey ainâ€™t _nobody_ kin git up a plan datâ€™s moâ€™
mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz.â€

we was all glad as we could be, but tom was the gladdest of all because
he had a bullet in the calf of his leg.

when me and jim heard that we didnâ€™t feel so brash as what we did
before. it was hurting him considera

done it just as slick as nothing at all, too.  man the sweeps--man the

but me and jim was consulting--and thinking.  and after weâ€™d thought a
minute, i says:

â€œsay it, jim.â€

so he says:

â€œwell, den, dis is de way it look to me, huck.  ef it wuz _him_ dat â€˜uz

i knowed he was white inside, and i reckoned heâ€™d say what he did say--so
it was all right now, and i told tom i was a-going for a doctor.
 he raised considerable row about it, but me and jim stuck to it and
wouldnâ€™t budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose
himself; but we wouldnâ€™t let him.  then he give us a piece of his mind,
but it didnâ€™t do no good.

so when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:

â€œwell, then, if youâ€™re bound to go, iâ€™ll tell you the way to do when you
get to the village.  shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and
fast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse

back alleys and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him here in the
canoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him and take
his chalk away from him, and donâ€™t give it back to him till you get him
back to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it
again. itâ€™s the way they all do.â€

so i said i would, and left, and jim was to hide in the woods when he
see the doctor coming till he was gone again.




chapter xli.

the doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when i got
him up.  i told him me and my brother was over on spanish island hunting
yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about
midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and
shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and
not say nothing about it, nor let anybody kn

ost-office.â€

â€œno, you didnâ€™t give me no letter.â€

â€œwell, i must a forgot it.â€

so he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had
laid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her.  she says:

â€œwhy, itâ€™s from st. petersburg--itâ€™s from sis.â€

i allowed another walk would do me good; but i couldnâ€™t stir.  but
before she could break it open she dropped it and run--for she see
something. and so did i. it was tom sawyer on a mattress; and that old
doctor; and jim, in _her_ calico dress, with his hands tied behind him;
and a lot of people.  i hid the letter behind the first thing that come
handy, and rushed.  she flung herself at tom, crying, and says:

â€œoh, heâ€™s dead, heâ€™s dead, i know heâ€™s dead!â€

and tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,
which showed he warnâ€™t in his right mind; then she flung up her hands,
and says:

â€œheâ€™s alive, thank god!  and thatâ€™s enough!â€ and she snatched a kiss of

or the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders
right and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tongue
could go, every jump of the way.

i followed the men to see what they was going to do with jim; and the
old doctor and uncle silas followed after tom into the house.  the men
was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang jim for an example to
all the other niggers around there, so they wouldnâ€™t be trying to run
away like jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a
whole family scared most to death for days and nights.  but the others
said, donâ€™t do it, it wouldnâ€™t answer at all; he ainâ€™t our nigger, and
his owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure.  so that cooled
them down a little, because the people thatâ€™s always the most anxious
for to hang a nigger that hainâ€™t done just right is always the very
ones that ainâ€™t the most anxious to pay for him when theyâ€™ve got their

tion out of him.

they cussed jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side the
head once in a while, but jim never said nothing, and he never let on to
know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes
on him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to
a big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and
both legs, and said he warnâ€™t to have nothing but bread and water to
eat after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because
he didnâ€™t come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and
said a couple of farmers wit

about, and we never had no trouble. and the boy being in a kind of a
flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and
towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least
row nor said a word from the start.  he ainâ€™t no bad nigger, gentlemen;
thatâ€™s what i think about him.â€

somebody says:

â€œwell, it sounds very good, doctor, iâ€™m obleeged to say.â€

then the others softened up a little, too, and i was mighty thankful
to that old doctor for doing jim that good turn; and i was glad it was
according to my judgment of him, too; because i thought he had a good
heart in him and was a good man the first time i see him.  then they
all agreed that jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some
notice took of it, and reward.  so every one of them promised, right out
and hearty, that they wouldnâ€™t cuss him no more.

then they come out and locked him up.  i hoped they was going to say he
could have one or two of the chains took off, because

et down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful
now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and heâ€™d been sleeping
like that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the
time, and ten to one heâ€™d wake up in his right mind.

so we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his
eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:

â€œhello!--why, iâ€™m at _home_!  howâ€™s that?  whereâ€™s the raft?â€

â€œitâ€™s all right,â€ i says.

â€œand _jim_?â€

â€œthe same,â€ i says, but couldnâ€™t say it pretty brash.  but he never
noticed, but says:

â€œgood!  splendid!  _now_ weâ€™re all right and safe! did you tell aunty?â€

i was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:  â€œabout what, sid?â€

â€œwhy, about the way the whole thing was done.â€

â€œwhat whole thing?â€

â€œwhy, _the_ whole thing.  there ainâ€™t but one; how we set the runaway
nigger free--me and tom.â€

â€œgood land!  set the run--what _is_ the child talking about!

aws, and pens, and
inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you canâ€™t think _half_ the
fun it was.  and we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things,
and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the
lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder
and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work
with in your apron pocket--â€

â€œmercy sakes!â€

â€œ--and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company for
jim; and then you kept tom here so long with the butter in his hat that
you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before
we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let
drive at us, and i got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let
them go by, and when the dogs come they warnâ€™t interested in us, but
went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the
raft, and was all safe, and jim was a free man, and we done it all by
ourselves, and

 go on and call me aunt sally, iâ€™m
used to it now, and â€˜tainâ€™t no need to changeâ€--that when aunt sally took
me for tom sawyer i had to stand it--there warnâ€™t no other way, and
i knowed he wouldnâ€™t mind, because it would be nuts for him, being
a mystery, and heâ€™d make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly
satisfied.  and so it turned out, and he let on to be sid, and made
things as soft as he could for me.

and his aunt polly she said tom was right about old miss watson setting
jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, tom sawyer had gone and took
all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and i couldnâ€™t
ever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he _could_
help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.

well, aunt polly she said that when aunt sally wrote to her that tom and
_sid_ had come all right and safe, she says to herself:

way without anybody to watch hi

i wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadnâ€™t, but i reckoned maybe it
was just as safe to not to.  so i never said nothing.




chapter the last

the first time i catched tom private i asked him what was his idea, time
of the evasion?--what it was heâ€™d planned to do if the evasion worked all
right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before?
and he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we got
jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft, and
have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him about
his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style,
and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all
the niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight
procession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would
we.  but i reckoned it was about as well the way it was.

we had jim out of the

 chains in no time, and when aunt polly and uncle
silas and aunt sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse tom,
they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him
all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do.  and we had
him up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and tom give jim forty
dollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good,
and jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:

â€œdah, now, huck, what i tell you?--what i tell you up dah on jackson

ainâ€™t got no money for to buy the outfit, and i reckon i couldnâ€™t get
none from home, because itâ€™s likely papâ€™s been back before now, and got
it all away from judge thatcher and drunk it up.

â€œno, he hainâ€™t,â€ tom says; â€œitâ€™s all there yet--six thousand dollars
and more; and your pap hainâ€™t ever been back since.  hadnâ€™t when i come
away, anyhow.â€

jim says, kind of solemn:

â€œhe ainâ€™t a-cominâ€™ back no moâ€™, huck.â€

i says:

â€œwhy, jim?â€

â€œnemmine why, huck--but he ainâ€™t cominâ€™ back no mo.â€

but i kept at him; so at last he says:

â€œdoanâ€™ you â€˜member de house dat was floatâ€™n down de river, en dey wuz a
