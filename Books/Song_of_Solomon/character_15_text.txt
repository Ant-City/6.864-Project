ght of the disjunctive social and economic realities within black american
communities. as a consequence, the macon dead family, rigid with convention
and construct, is left muted and emotionally drained.
but these images do not begin the novel. instead, the opening scene
presents a mandril from which morrison develops her contrastive and transformational
mythopoesis. when milkman is born, he is the first black baby
admitted to the townâ€™s white-only mercy hospital. he is born on the day
after robert smith, a north carolina mutual life insurance agent, leaps to
his death from the roof of mercy. vowing in a letter that he would â€œ . . . take
off from mercy and fly away on [his] own wings,â€ he attracts a crowd of â€œforty
or fifty peopleâ€ (3) who stand to watch even though it is the dead of winter. in
the crowd are ruth, pregnant with milkman, and her two young daughters.
the sight of smith clad in his â€œblue silk wingsâ€ causes ruth to drop her peck

the discovery of guitarâ€™s involvement in the seven days brings the
reader full circle to the textâ€™s original scene. robert smith was himself a
member of the days and guitar was a witness to his flightless death. like
smith, guitarâ€™s vision of violence begetting violence keeps him on a flightless
path until he is driven to madness by his own obsession for pilateâ€™s gold.
his ideology proves just as inadequate as macon deadâ€™s acculturated vision.
however, like his fatherâ€™s corpse, guitar is a split subject. while he espouses
his single-minded doctrine, he nonetheless appears as milkmanâ€™s alter-ego,

but, as susan continues, solomon â€œâ€˜brushed too close to a tree and the baby

the long rupture in his familyâ€™s history.
we have once again come full circle in the novel. from the beginning, all
images and scenes of flight have ended either in death, disillusion, or desertion.
robert smith, driven to madness and to an â€œartificialâ€ flight, had wished

to free himself from the death and distortion of the seven days. milkmanâ€™s
failed flight for gold violates the principle of responsibility to others, and is
especially destructive to hagar, who later dies alone and inconsolate. and
solomonâ€™s flight, while freeing him to return to his homeland, results in
the abandonment of family and friends. these types of absolute

family migrates to the midwest in order to escape racism and violence.
the locale of the novelâ€™s opening initially suggests a distance from morrisonâ€™s
lorain, ohio, set as it is in michigan. for years i have assumed that the
setting of part i was detroit, though that does not seem to square with the
geography of the state. on closer examination, it appears that it is a michigan
of the imagination, not one locatable on any map. the novelâ€™s first sentence
creates a problem when robert smith announces his intention to fly â€œto the
other side of lake superiorâ€ (3). this implies that his point of departure is on
the opposite side of the lake, yet the only part of michigan touching superior
is the upper peninsula, a place where very few african americans live.
while it does seem significant that smith wishes to fly to canada, that site
of freedom for african americans escaping slavery, it probably is a pointless
exercise attempting to name the precise michigan locale (could it be

as she lies dying in milkmanâ€™s arms, she tells him: â€œi wish iâ€™d a knowed
more people. i would of loved â€™em all. if iâ€™d a knowed more, i would a loved
moreâ€ (336). the kind of flying milkman ultimately understands and values
is pilateâ€™s flying, the ability to transcend self and self-love. and surely pilateâ€™s
claim serves as an intratextual critique pointing out the inauthenticity of
guitarâ€™s claim (one echoed by porter and robert smith) that the seven daysâ€™
killing is done for love. what weighed milkman down for so much of song of
solomon is male ego (much as hagar is destroyed by her desire to be the desire
of male ego), forged in the structures of a patriarchal society.
the novelâ€™s conclusion is noteworthy for its ambiguity that has occasioned
a variety of critical response.20 does milkman actually fly? does he
live or die following his struggle with guitar? finally, i believe, it does not

misses milkman and kills pilate as they are burying jakeâ€™s remains. the novel
ends with milkmanâ€™s revision of the song of solomon as he sings to pilate,
naming her as â€œsugargirlâ€ and then leaping off a cliff in a reenactment of his
great-grandfatherâ€™s flight. the linear tale with its teleology of the heroic quest
is now circumscribed by a ring composition, suggesting eternal repetitions
of flight and song. we can choose to think that milkman has plunged to his
death, like icarus and robert smith, whose suicide flight opened the novel,
or that he has replicated the flight of his great-grandfather shalimar, and
flown away. however our imagination completes the tale for us, two related
structural qualities are obvious: first, the story is a ring composition, coming

in mid-air, that is to say, it does not end.
