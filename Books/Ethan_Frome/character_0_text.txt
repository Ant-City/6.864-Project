ethan frome

i had the story, bit by bit, from various people, and, as generally happens in such cases, each time it was a different story.
if you know starkfield, massachusetts, you know the post-office. if you know the post-office you must have seen ethan frome drive up to it, drop the reins on his hollow-backed bay and drag himself across the brick pavement to the white colonnade; and you must have asked who he was.
it was there that, several years ago, i saw him for the first time; and the sight pulled me up sharp. even then he was the most striking figure in starkfield, though he was but the ruin of a man. it was not so much his great height that marked him, for the â€œnativesâ€ were easily singled out by their lank longitude from the stockier for

old man and was surprised to hear that he was not more than fifty-two. i had this from harmon gow, who had driven the stage from bettsbridge to starkfield in pre-trolley days and knew the chronicle of all the families on his line.
â€œheâ€™s looked that way ever since he had his smash-up; and thatâ€™s twenty-four years ago come next february,â€ harmon threw out between reminiscent pauses.
the â€œsmash-upâ€ it wasâ€”i gathered from the same informantâ€”which, besides drawing the red gash across ethan fromeâ€™s forehead, had so shortened and warped his right side that it cost him a visible effort to take the few steps from his buggy to the post-office window. he used to drive in from his farm every day at about noon, and as that was my own hour for fetching my mail i often passed him in the porch or stood beside him while we waited on the motions of the distributing hand behind the grating. i noticed that, though he came so punctually, he seldom received anything but a copy of the bettsbridge eagl

s left hand and drive slowly away in the direction of his farm.
â€œit was a pretty bad smash-up?â€ i questioned harmon, looking after fromeâ€™s retreating figure, and thinking how gallantly his lean brown head, with its shock of light hair, must have sat on his strong shoulders before they were bent out of shape.
â€œwust kind,â€ my informant assented. â€œmoreâ€™n enough to kill most men. but the fromes are tough. ethanâ€™ll likely touch a hundred.â€
â€œgood god!â€ i exclaimed. at the moment ethan frome, after climbing to his seat, had leaned over to assure himself of the security of a wooden boxâ€”also with a druggistâ€™s label on itâ€”which he had placed in the back of the buggy, and i saw his face as it probably looked when he thought himself alone. â€œthat man touch a hundred? he looks as if he was dead and in hell now!â€
harmon drew a slab of tobacco from his pocket, cut off a wedge and pressed it into the leather pouch of his cheek. â€œguess heâ€™s been in starkfield too many winters. m

e day of trolley, bicycle and rural delivery, when communication was easy between the scattered mountain villages, and the bigger towns in the valleys, such as bettsbridge and shaddâ€™s falls, had libraries, theatres and y. m. c. a. halls to which the youth of the hills could descend for recreation. but when winter shut down on starkfield and the village lay under a sheet of snow perpetually renewed from the pale skies, i began to see what life thereâ€”or rather its negationâ€”must have been in ethan fromeâ€™s young manhood.
i had been sent up by my employers on a job connected with the big power-house at corbury junction, and a long-drawn carpentersâ€™ strike had so delayed the work that i found myself anchored at starkfieldâ€”the nearest habitable spotâ€”for the best part of the winter. i chafed at first, and then, under the hypnotising effect of routine, gradually began to find a grim satisfaction in the life. during the early part of my stay i had been struck by the contrast between the vital

rstand why starkfield emerged from its six monthsâ€™ siege like a starved garrison capitulating without quarter. twenty years earlier the means of resistance must have been far fewer, and the enemy in command of almost all the lines of access between the beleaguered villages; and, considering these things, i felt the sinister force of harmonâ€™s phrase: â€œmost of the smart ones get away.â€ but if that were the case, how could any combination of obstacles have hindered the flight of a man like ethan frome?
during my stay at starkfield i lodged with a middle-aged widow colloquially known as mrs. ned hale. mrs. haleâ€™s father had been the village lawyer of the previous generation, and â€œlawyer varnumâ€™s house,â€ where my landlady still lived with her mother, was the most considerable mansion in the village. it stood at one end of the main street, its classic portico and small-paned windows looking down a flagged path between norway spruces to the slim white steeple of the congregational church

, i listened every evening to another and more delicately shaded version of the starkfield chronicle. it was not that mrs. ned hale felt, or affected, any social superiority to the people about her; it was only that the accident of a finer sensibility and a little more education had put just enough distance between herself and her neighbours to enable her to judge them with detachment. she was not unwilling to exercise this faculty, and i had great hopes of getting from her the missing facts of ethan fromeâ€™s story, or rather such a key to his character as should co-ordinate the facts i knew. her mind was a store-house of innocuous anecdote and any question about her acquaintances brought forth a volume of detail; but on the subject of ethan frome i found her unexpectedly reticent. there was no hint of disapproval in her reserve; i merely felt in her an insurmountable reluctance to speak of him or his affairs, a low â€œyes, i knew them both... it was awful...â€ seeming to be the utmost concessi

€˜em after they was picked up. it happened right below lawyer varnumâ€™s, down at the bend of the corbury road, just round about the time that ruth got engaged to ned hale. the young folks was all friends, and i guess she just canâ€™t bear to talk about it. sheâ€™s had troubles enough of her own.â€
all the dwellers in starkfield, as in more notable communities, had had troubles enough of their own to make them comparatively indifferent to those of their neighbours; and though all conceded that ethan fromeâ€™s had been beyond the common measure, no one gave me an explanation of the look in his face which, as i persisted in thinking, neither poverty nor physical suffering could have put there. nevertheless, i might have contented myself with the story pieced together from these hints had it not been for the provocation of mrs. haleâ€™s silence, andâ€”a little laterâ€”for the accident of personal contact with the man.
on my arrival at starkfield, denis eady, the rich irish grocer, who was the propr

ietor of starkfieldâ€™s nearest approach to a livery stable, had entered into an agreement to send me over daily to corbury flats, where i had to pick up my train for the junction. but about the middle of the winter eadyâ€™s horses fell ill of a local epidemic. the illness spread to the other starkfield stables and for a day or two i was put to it to find a means of transport. then harmon gow suggested that ethan fromeâ€™s bay was still on his legs and that his owner might be glad to drive me over.
i stared at the suggestion. â€œethan frome? but iâ€™ve never even spoken to him. why on earth should he put himself out for me?â€
harmonâ€™s answer surprised me still more. â€œi donâ€™t know as he would; but i know he wouldnâ€™t be sorry to earn a dollar.â€
i had been told that frome was poor, and that the saw-mill and the arid acres of his farm yielded scarcely enough to keep his household through the winter; bu

es out now. fust his father got a kick, out haying, and went soft in the brain, and gave away money like bible texts afore he died. then his mother got queer and dragged along for years as weak as a baby; and his wife zeena, sheâ€™s always been the greatest hand at doctoring in the county. sickness and trouble: thatâ€™s what ethanâ€™s had his plate full up with, ever since the very first helping.â€
the next morning, when i looked out, i saw the hollow-backed bay between the varnum spruces, and ethan frome, throwing back his worn bearskin, made room for me in the sleigh at his side. after that, for a week, he drove me over every morning to corbury flats, and on my return in the afternoon met me again and carried me back through the icy night to starkfield. the distance each way was barely three miles, but the old bayâ€™s pace was slow, and even with firm snow under the runners we were nearly an hour on the way. ethan frome drove in silence, the reins loosely held in his left hand, his brown seame

taircase rose into obscurity. on our right a line of light marked the door of the room which had sent its ray across the night; and behind the door i heard a womanâ€™s voice droning querulously.
frome stamped on the worn oil-cloth to shake the snow from his boots, and set down his lantern on a kitchen chair which was the only piece of furniture in the hall. then he opened the door.
â€œcome in,â€ he said; and as he spoke the droning voice grew still...
it was that night that i found the clue to ethan frome, and began to put together this vision of his story.

the village lay under two feet of snow, with drifts at the windy corners. in a sky of iron the points of the dipper hung like icicles and orion flashed his cold fires. the moon had set, but the night was so transparent that the white house-fronts between the elms looked gray against the snow, clumps of bushes made black stains on it, and the basement windows of the church sent shafts of yellow light far across the endless undulations.

young ethan frome walked at a quick pace along the deserted street, past the bank and michael eadyâ€™s new brick store and lawyer varnumâ€™s house with the two black norway spruces at the gate. opposite the varnum gate, where the road fell away toward the corbury valley, the church reared its slim white steeple and narrow peristyle. as the young man walked toward it the upper windows drew a black arcade along the side wall of the building, but from the lower openings, on the side where the ground sloped steeply

face to that of her partner, which, in the exhilaration of the dance, had taken on a look of almost impudent ownership. denis eady was the son of michael eady, the ambitious irish grocer, whose suppleness and effrontery had given starkfield its first notion of â€œsmartâ€ business methods, and whose new brick store testified to the success of the attempt. his son seemed likely to follow in his steps, and was meanwhile applying the same arts to the conquest of the starkfield maidenhood. hitherto ethan frome had been content to think him a mean fellow; but now he positively invited a horse-whipping. it was strange that the girl did not seem aware of it: that she could lift her rapt face to her dancerâ€™s, and drop her hands into his, without appearing to feel the offence of his look and touch.
frome was in the habit of walking into starkfield to fetch home his wifeâ€™s cousin, mattie silver, on the rare evenings when some chance of amusement drew her to the village. it was his wife who had suggeste

 of joy had unsteadied him, and the inflection with which she had said of the engaged couple â€œtheyâ€™re so happy!â€ made the words sound as if she had been thinking of herself and him.
â€œthe elm is dangerous, though. it ought to be cut down,â€ she insisted.
â€œwould you be afraid of it, with me?â€
â€œi told you i ainâ€™t the kind to be afraidâ€ she tossed back, almost indifferently; and suddenly she began to walk on with a rapid step.
these alterations of mood were the despair and joy of ethan frome. the motions of her mind were as incalculable as the flit of a bird in the branches. the fact that he had no right to show his feelings, and thus provoke the expression of hers, made him attach a fantastic importance to every change in her look and tone. now he thought she understood him, and feared; now he was sure she did not, and despaired. to-night the pressure of accumulated misgivings sent the scale drooping toward despair, and her indifference was the more chilling after the flush of joy

otherâ€™s face.
â€œi know i ainâ€™t anything like as smart as i ought to be,â€ she went on, while he vainly struggled for expression. â€œthereâ€™s lots of things a hired girl could do that come awkward to me stillâ€”and i havenâ€™t got much strength in my arms. but if sheâ€™d only tell me iâ€™d try. you know she hardly ever says anything, and sometimes i can see she ainâ€™t suited, and yet i donâ€™t know why.â€ she turned on him with a sudden flash of indignation. â€œyouâ€™d ought to tell me, ethan fromeâ€”youâ€™d ought to! unless you want me to go tooâ€”â€
unless he wanted her to go too! the cry was balm to his raw wound. the iron heavens seemed to melt and rain down sweetness. again he struggled for the all-expressive word, and again, his arm in hers, found only a deep â€œcome along.â€
they walked on in silence through the blackness of the hemlock-shaded lane, where ethanâ€™s sawmill gloomed through the night, and out again into the comparative clearness of the fields. on the farther side o

 of larches at the gate, a light twinkling in the house above him. â€œsheâ€™s up in her room,â€ he said to himself, â€œfixing herself up for supperâ€; and he remembered zeenaâ€™s sarcastic stare when mattie, on the evening of her arrival, had come down to supper with smoothed hair and a ribbon at her neck.
he passed by the graves on the knoll and turned his head to glance at one of the older headstones, which had interested him deeply as a boy because it bore his name.
sacred to the memory of ethan frome and endurance his wife, who dwelled together in peace for fifty years.
he used to think that fifty years sounded like a long time to live together; but now it seemed to him that they might pass in a flash. then, with a sudden dart of irony, he wondered if, when their turn came, the same epitaph would be written over him and zeena.
he opened the barn-door and craned his head into the obscurity, half-fearing to discover denis eadyâ€™s roan colt in the stall beside the sorrel. but the old horse wa

on ethan, she bent over to add: â€œi onâ€™y just heard from mr. hale â€˜bout zeenaâ€™s going over to bettsbridge to see that new doctor. iâ€™m real sorry sheâ€™s feeling so bad again! i hope he thinks he can do something for her. i donâ€™t know anybody round hereâ€™s had more sickness than zeena. i always tell mr. hale i donâ€™t know what sheâ€™d â€˜aâ€™ done if she hadnâ€™t â€˜aâ€™ had you to look after her; and i used to say the same thing â€˜bout your mother. youâ€™ve had an awful mean time, ethan frome.â€
she gave him a last nod of sympathy while her son chirped to the horse; and ethan, as she drove off, stood in the middle of the road and stared after the retreating sleigh.
it was a long time since any one had spoken to him as kindly as mrs. hale. most people were either indifferent to his troubles, or disposed to think it natural that a young fellow of his age should have carried without repining the burden of three crippled lives. but mrs. hale had said, â€œyouâ€™ve had an awful mean time

, ethan frome,â€ and he felt less alone with his misery. if the hales were sorry for him they would surely respond to his appeal...
he started down the road toward their house, but at the end of a few yards he pulled up sharply, the blood in his face. for the first time, in the light of the words he had just heard, he saw what he was about to do. he was planning to take advantage of the halesâ€™ sympathy to obtain money from them on false pretences. that was a plain statement of the cloudy purpose which had

d at me and said: â€œthis is my wife, misâ€™ frome.â€ after another interval he added, turning toward the figure in the arm-chair: â€œand this is miss mattie silver...â€
mrs. hale, tender soul, had pictured me as lost in the flats and buried under a snow-drift; and so lively was her satisfaction on seeing me safely restored to her the next morning that i felt my peril had caused me to advance several degrees in her favour.
great was her amazement, and that of old mrs. varnum, on learning that ethan fromeâ€™s old horse had carried me to and from corbury junction through the worst blizzard of the winter; greater still their surprise when they heard that his master had taken me in for the night.
beneath their wondering exclamations i felt a secret curiosity to know what impressions i had received from my night in the frome household, and divined that the best way of breaking down their reserve was to let them try to penetrate mine. i therefore confined myself to saying, in a matter-of-fact tone, t
