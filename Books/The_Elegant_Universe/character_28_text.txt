he  electron,  called  a tau,  as  well  as  two  other  particles  with  properties
similar  to  the  neutrino  (called  the muon-neutrino  and tau-neutrino  to  distinguish  them  from  the
original  neutrino,  now  called  the electron-neutrino).  these  particles  are  produced  through  high-
energy  collisions  and  exist  only  ephemerally;  they  are  not  constituents  of  anything  we  typically
encounter. but even this is not quite the end of the story. each of these particles has an antiparticle
partner—a particle of identical mass but opposite in certain other respects such as its electric charge
(as well as its charges with respect to other forces discussed below). for instance, the antiparticle of
an electron is called a positron—it has exactly the same mass as an electron, but its electric charge is
+1  whereas  the  electric  charge  of  the  electron  is  -1.  when  in  contact,  matter  and  antimatter  can
annihilate one another to produce pure energy—that's why there is

trajectory.  point-particle  quantum  field  theory  shows  that  essentially  the  same  thing  happens  when
elementary particles collide—they scatter off one another and continue on deflected trajectories—but
the details are a little different.

figure 6.5 two particles interact—they "slam together"—and cause the path of each to be deflected.

for  concreteness  and  simplicity,  imagine  that  one  of  the  two  particles  is  an  electron  and  the
other is its antiparticle, the positron. when matter and antimatter collide, they can annihilate in a flash
of pure energy, producing, for example, a photon.9 to distinguish the ensuing trajectory of the photon
from the previous trajectories of the electron and positron, we follow a traditional physics convention
and draw it with a wiggly line. the photon will typically travel for a bit and then release the energy
derived  from  the  initial  electron-positron  pair  by  producing  another  electron-positron  pair  with

trajectories as indicated on the far right of figure 6.6. in the end, two particles are fired at each other,
they interact through the electromagnetic force, and finally they emerge on deflected trajectories, a
sequence of events that bears some similarity to our description of colliding billiard balls.

figure  6.6  in  quantum  field  theory,  a  particle  and  its  antiparticle  can  momentarily  annihilate  one
another,  producing  a  photon.  subsequently,  this  photon  can  give  rise  to  another  particle  and
antiparticle traveling along different trajectories.

we are concerned with the details of the interaction—specifically, the point where the initial
electron and positron annihilate and produce the photon. the central fact, as will become apparent, is
that there is an unambiguous, completely identifiable time and place where this happens: it is marked

s gets stronger as the distance between the objects
decreases.  these  are  simple  and  well-known  features  of  classical  physics.  there  is  a  surprise,
though, when we study the effect that quantum physics has on force strengths. why should quantum
mechanics  have  any  effect  at  all?  the  answer,  once  again,  lies  in  quantum  fluctuations.  when  we
examine the electric force field of an electron, for example, we are actually examining it through the
"mist" of momentary particle-antiparticle eruptions and annihilations that are occurring all through the
region  of  space  surrounding  it.  physicists  some  time  ago  realized  that  this  seething  mist  of
microscopic fluctuations obscures the full strength of the electron's force field, somewhat as a thin fog
partially obscures the beacon of a lighthouse. but notice that as we get closer to the electron, we will
have penetrated more of the cloaking particle-antiparticle mist and hence will be less subject to its
diminishing infl

 the  region  has  not  changed.  but  this  is  only  on  average.  quantum
uncertainty implies that the energy in the field—even in an empty region of space—fluctuates up and
down,  with  the  size  of  the  fluctuations  getting  larger  as  the  distance  and  time  scales  on  which  the
region is examined get smaller. the energy embodied in such momentary field fluctuations can then,
through e  = mc2,  be  converted  into  the  momentary  creation  of  pairs  of  particles  and  their
antiparticles, which annihilate each other in great haste, to keep the energy from changing, on average.
4. even though the initial equation that schrödinger wrote down—the one incorporating special
relativity—did not accurately describe the quantum-mechanical properties of electrons in hydrogen
atoms, it was soon realized to be a valuable equation when appropriately used in other contexts, and,
in fact, is still in use today. however, by the time schrödinger published his equation he had been

e experimentally within the next decade. but even in the more

"conventional" scenario espoused by string theorists, in which strings are typically on the order of 10-
33 centimeters in length, there are indirect ways to search for them experimentally, as we will discuss
in chapter 9.

9. the expert reader will recognize that the photon produced in a collision between an electron
and a positron is a virtual photon and therefore must shortly relinquish its energy by dissociating into
a particle-antiparticle pair.

10. of course, a camera works by collecting photons that bounce off the object of interest and
recording them on a piece of photographic film. our use of a camera in this example is symbolic,
since we are not imagining bouncing photons off of the colliding strings. rather, we simply want to
record in figure 6.7(c) the whole history of the interaction. having said that, we should point out one
further subtle point that the discussion in the text glosses over. we learned in chapter 4 that
