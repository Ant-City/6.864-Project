[CHARACTER]  - 
      the main female character of the story. [CHARACTER]'s role is prominent in the plot, especially toward the end. the daugher of the duke of castile, she is headstrong, as evidenced by her decisions to love andrea and horatio, both against her father's wishes. she is intelligent, beautiful, and, in moments of love, tender. she also is bent on revenge, both for her slain lover andrea and for horatio. her transformation into a machiavellian villain is not as dramatic as hieronimo's, but only because she shows signs of machiavellian behavior beforehand--her decision to love horatio, in part, may have been calculated revenge, undertaken in order to spite balthazar, andrea's killer.
