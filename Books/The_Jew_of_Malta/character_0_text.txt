     merchant. barabas, thy ships are safe,

     with other merchandise are safe arriv'd,
     and have sent me to know whether yourself
     will come and custom them. [22]

     barabas. the ships are safe thou say'st, and richly fraught?

     merchant. they are.

     barabas. why, then, go bid them come ashore,

     than many merchants of the town are worth,
     and therefore far exceeds my credit, sir.

     barabas. go tell 'em the jew of malta sent thee, man:

     but at the entry there into the sea,
     where nilus pays his tribute to the main,
     thou needs must sail by alexandria.

     second merchant. thine argosy from alexandria,

     laden with riches, and exceeding store
     of persian silks, of gold, and orient pearl.

     barabas. how chance you came not with those other ships
     that sail'd by egypt?

     second merchant. sir, we saw 'em not.

     barabas. belike they coasted round by candy-shore
     about their oils or other businesses.
     but 'twas ill done of you to come so far
     without the aid or conduct of their ships.

     for he can counsel best in these affairs:
     and here he comes.

     barabas. why, how now, countrymen!
     why flock you thus to me in multitudes?
     what accident's betided to the jews?

     first jew. a fleet of warlike galleys, barabas,
     are come from turkey, and lie in our road:
     and they this day sit in the council-house
     to entertain them and their embassy.

     barabas. fond [27] men, what dream you of their multitudes?
     what need they treat of peace that are in league?
     the turks and those of malta are in league:
     tut, tut, there is some other matter in't.

     first jew. why, barabas, they come for peace or war.

     barabas. haply for neither, but to pass along,
     towards venice, by the adriatic sea,
     with whom they have attempted many times,
     but never could effect their stratagem.

     great selim calymath, his highness' son,
     to levy of us ten years' tribute past:

     barabas. alas, my lord, we are no soldiers!
     and what's our aid against so great a prince?

     thou art a merchant and a money'd man,

     shall all be levied amongst the jews, and each of them to pay
     one half of his estate.

     barabas. how! half his estate!--i hope you mean not mine.

     ferneze. then pay thy half.

     barabas. why, know you what you did by this device?
     half of my substance is a city's wealth.
     governor, it was not got so easily;
     nor will i part so slightly therewithal.

     ferneze. sir, half is the penalty of our decree;
     either pay that, or we will seize on all.

     barabas. corpo di dio! stay:  you shall have half;
     let me be us'd but as my brethren are.

     is theft the ground of your religion?

     ferneze. no, jew; we take particularly thine,
     to save the ruin of a multitude:
     and better one want for a common good,
     than many perish for a private man:
     yet, barabas, we will not banish thee,
     but here in malta, where thou gott'st thy wealth,

     of naught is nothing made.

     first knight. from naught at first thou cam'st to little wealth,
     ]from little unto more, from more to most:
     if your first curse fall heavy on thy head,
     and make thee poor and scorn'd of all the world,
     'tis not our fault, but thy inherent sin.

     barabas. what, bring you scripture to confirm your wrongs?
     preach me not out of my possessions.
     some jews are wicked, as all christians are:

     sham'st thou not thus to justify thyself,
     as if we knew not thy profession?
     if thou rely upon thy righteousness,
     be patient, and thy riches will increase.
     excess of wealth is cause of covetousness;
     and covetousness, o, 'tis a monstrous sin!

     barabas. ay, but theft is worse:  tush! take not from me, then,
     for that is theft; and, if you rob me thus,
     i must be forc'd to steal, and compass more.

     first officer. ay, my lord, we have seiz'd upon the goods
     and wares of barabas, which, being valu'd,
     amount to more than all the wealth in malta:
     and of the other we have seized half.

     ferneze. then we'll take [40] order for the residue.

     barabas. well, then, my lord, say, are you satisfied?
     you have my goods, my money, and my wealth,
     my ships, my store, and all that i enjoy'd;
     and, having all, you can request no more,
     unless your unrelenting flinty hearts
     suppress all pity in your stony breasts,
     and now shall move you to bereave my life.

     abigail. grave abbess, and you happy virgins' guide,

     abigail. the hopeless daughter of a hapless jew,
     the jew of malta, wretched barabas,

     which they have now turn'd to a nunnery.

     abbess. well, daughter, say, what is thy suit with us?

     abigail. fearing the afflictions which my father feels
     proceed from sin or want of faith in us,
     i'd pass away my life in penitence,
     and be a novice in your nunnery,
     to make atonement for my labouring soul.

     my solitary life to your strait laws,
     and let me lodge where i was wont to lie:
     i do not doubt, by your divine precepts

     mathias. a fair young maid, scarce fourteen years of age,
     the sweetest flower in cytherea's field,
     cropt from the pleasures of the fruitful earth,
     and strangely metamorphos'd [to a] nun.

     lodowick. but say, what was she?

     mathias. why, the rich jew's daughter.

     lodowick. what, barabas, whose goods were lately seiz'd?
     is she so fair?

     mathias. and matchless beautiful,
     as, had you seen her, 'twould have mov'd your heart,
     though countermin'd with walls of brass, to love,
     or, at the least, to pity.

     see 'em go pinion'd along by my door.

     once at jerusalem, where the pilgrims kneel'd,

     whither goes don mathias? stay a while.

     mathias. whither, but to my fair love abigail?

     barabas. thou know'st, and heaven can witness it is true,
     that i intend my daughter shall be thine.

     mathias. ay, barabas, or else thou wrong'st me much.

     barabas. o, heaven forbid i should have such a thought!
     pardon me though i weep:  the governor's son
     will, whether i will or no, have abigail;
     he sends her letters, bracelets, jewels, rings.

     mathias. does she receive them?

     barabas. she! no, mathias, no, but sends them back;
     and, when he comes, she locks herself up fast;
     yet through the key-hole will he talk to her,
     while she runs to the window, looking out

     mathias. i'll rouse him thence.

     barabas. not for all malta; therefore sheathe your sword;
     if you love me, no quarrels in my house;
     but steal you in, and seem to see him not:
     i'll give him such a warning ere he goes,

     lodowick. my death! what, is the base-born peasant mad?

     barabas. no, no; but happily [86] he stands in fear
     of that which you, i think, ne'er dream upon,--
     my daughter here, a paltry silly girl.

     lodowick. why, loves she don mathias?

     barabas. doth she not with her smiling answer you?

     abigail. he has my heart; i smile against my will.

     and, barabas, you know--

     barabas. i know that i have highly sinn'd:
     you shall convert me, you shall have all my wealth.

     friar jacomo. o barabas, their laws are strict!

     barabas. i know they are; and i will be with you.

     friar barnardine. they wear no shirts, and they go bare-foot too.

     barabas. then 'tis not for me; and i am resolv'd
     you shall confess me, and have all my goods.

     friar jacomo. i'll be with you to-night.

     barabas. come to my house at one o'clock this night.

     friar jacomo. you hear your answer, and you may be gone.

     friar barnardine. why, go, get you away.

     friar jacomo. i will not go for thee.

     friar barnardine. not! then i'll make thee go.

     friar jacomo. how! dost call me rogue?

          [they fight.]

     ithamore. part 'em, master, part 'em.

     barabas. this is mere frailty:  brethren, be content.--
     friar barnardine, go you with ithamore:
     you know my mind; let me alone with him.

     friar jacomo. why does he go to thy house? let him be gone. [133]

     barabas. i'll give him something, and so stop his mouth.
          [exit ithamore with friar barnardine.]
     i never heard of any man but he
     malign'd the order of the jacobins:

 i am bound in charity to requite it,

     for presently you shall be shriv'd.

     barabas. marry, the turk [134] shall be one of my godfathers,
     but not a word to any of your covent. [135]

     friar jacomo. i warrant thee, barabas.

     for he that shriv'd her is within my house:
     what, if i murder'd him ere jacomo comes?
     now i have such a plot for both their lives,
     as never jew nor christian knew the like:
     one turn'd my daughter, therefore he shall die;
     the other knows enough to have my life,
     therefore 'tis not requisite he should live. [136]

     no more, but so:  it must and shall be done. [138]

          enter ithamore.

     ithamore, tell me, is the friar asleep?

     ithamore. yes; and i know not what the reason is,
     do what i can, he will not strip himself,
     nor go to bed, but sleeps in his own clothes:
     i fear me he mistrusts what we intend.

     barabas. no; 'tis an order which the friars use:
     yet, if he knew our meanings, could he scape?

     ithamore. no, none can hear him, cry he ne'er so loud.

     barabas. why, true; therefore did i place him there:
     the other chambers open towards the street.

     ithamore. you loiter, master; wherefore stay we thus?
     o, how i long to see him shake his heels!

     barabas. come on, sirrah:
     off with your girdle; make a handsome noose.--

     friar, awake! [139]
          [they put the noose round the friar's neck.]

     friar barnardine. what, do you mean to strangle me?

     ithamore. yes, 'cause you use to confess.

     barabas. blame not us, but the proverb,--confess and be
     hanged.--pull hard.

     friar barnardine. what, will you have [140] my life?

     barabas. pull hard, i say.--you would have had my goods.

     ithamore. ay, and our lives too:--therefore pull amain.
          [they strangle the friar.]
     'tis neatly done, sir; here's no print at all.

     barabas. then is it as it should be.  take him up.

     ithamore. nay, master, be ruled by me a little.  [takes the body,
     sets it upright against the wall, and puts a staff in its hand.]
     so, let him lean upon his staff; excellent! he stands as if he

     calymath. now vail [186] your pride, you captive christians,
     and kneel for mercy to your conquering foe:
     now where's the hope you had of haughty spain?
     ferneze, speak; had it not been much better
     to kept [187] thy promise t

     ferneze. what should i say? we are captives, and must yield.

     calymath. ay, villains, you must yield, and under turkish yokes
     shall groaning bear the burden of our ire:--
     and, barabas, as erst we promis'd thee,
     for thy desert we make thee governor;
     use them at thy discretion.

     barabas. thanks, my lord.

     ferneze. o fatal day, to fall into the hands
     of such a traitor and unhallow'd jew!
     what greater misery could heaven inflict?

     calymath. 'tis our command:--and, barabas, we give,
     to guard thy person, these our janizaries:
     entreat [188] them well, as we have used thee.--
     and now, brave bassoes, [189] come; we'll walk about
     the ruin'd town, and see the wreck we made.--
     farewell, brave jew, farewell, great barabas!

     captains, his consorts and confederates.

     ferneze. o villain! heaven will be reveng'd on thee.

     barabas. away! no more; let him not trouble me.
          [exeunt turks with ferneze and knights.]
     thus hast thou gotten, [190] by thy policy,
     no simple place, no small authority:
     i now am governor of malta; true,--
     but malta hates me, and, in hating me,
     my life's in danger; and what boots it thee,
     poor barabas, to be the governor,
     whenas [191] thy life shall be at their command?
     no, barabas, this must be look'd into;
     and, since by wrong thou gott'st authori

     maintain it bravely by firm policy;
     at least, unprofitably lose it not;
     for he that liveth in authority,
     and neither gets him friends nor fills his bags,
     lives like the ass that aesop speaketh of,
     that labours with a load of bread and wine,
     and leaves it off to snap on thistle-tops:
     but barabas will be more circumspect.
     begin betimes; occasion's bald behind:
     slip not thine opportunity, for fear too late
     thou seek'st for much, but canst not compass it.--
     within here! [192]

          enter ferneze, with a guard.

     ferneze. my lord?

     barabas. ay, lord; thus slaves will learn.
     now, governor,--stand by there, wait within,--
          [exeunt guard.]
     this is the reason that i sent for thee:
     thou seest thy life and malta's happiness

     at his discretion may dispose of both:
     now tell me, governor, and plainly too,
     what think'st thou shall become of it and thee?

     ferneze. this, barabas; since things are in thy power,
     i see no reason but of malta's wreck,
     nor hope of thee but extreme cruelty:
     nor fear i death, nor will i flatter thee.

     barabas. governor, good words; be not so furious
     'tis not thy life which can avail me aught;
     yet you do live, and live for me you shall:
     and as for malta's ruin, think you not
     'twere slender policy for barabas
     to dispossess himself of such a place?
     for sith, [193] as once you said, within this isle,
     in malta here, that i have got my goods,
     and in this city still have had success,
     and now at length am grown your governor,

     for, as a friend not known but in distress,
     i'll rear up malta, now remediless.

     ferneze. will barabas recover malta's loss?
     will barabas be good to christians?

     barabas. what wilt thou give me, governor, to procure
     a dissolution of the slavish bands
     wherein the turk hath yok'd your land and you?
     what will you give me if i render you
     the life of calymath, surprise his men,
     and in an out-house of the city shut
     his soldiers, till i have consum'd 'em all with fire?
     what will you give him that procureth this?

     ferneze. do but bring this to pass which thou pretendest,
     deal truly with us as thou intimatest,
     and i will

 send amongst the citizens,
     and by my letters privately procure
     great sums of money for thy recompense:
     nay, more, do this, and live thou governor still.

     barabas. nay, do thou this, ferneze, and be free:
     governor, i enlarge thee; live with me;
     go walk about the city, see thy friends:
     tush, send not letters to 'em; go thyself,
     and let me see what money thou canst make:
     here is my hand that i'll set malta free;
     and thus we cast [194] it:  to a solemn feast
     i will invite young selim calymath,
     where be thou present, only to perform
     one stratagem that i'll impart to thee,
     wherein no danger shall betide thy li

     and i will warrant malta free for ever.

     ferneze. here is my hand; believe me, barabas,
     i will be there, and do as thou desirest.
     when is the time?

     barabas. governor, presently;
     for calymath, when he hath view'd the town,
     will take his leave, and sail toward ottoman.

     ferneze. then will i, barabas, about this coin,
     and bring it with me to thee in the evening.

     barabas. do so; but fail not:  now farewell, ferneze:--
          [exit ferneze.]
     and thus far roundly goes the business:
     thus, loving neither, will i live with both,
     making a profit of my policy;
     and he from whom my most advantage comes,
     shall be my friend.
     this is the life we jews are us'd to lead;
     and reason too, for christians do the like.

     and then to make provision fo

     we rent in sunder at our entry:
     and, now i see the situation,
     and how secure this conquer'd island stands,
     environ'd with the mediterranean sea,
     strong-countermin'd with other petty isles,
     and, toward calabria, [197] back'd by sicily
     (where syracusian dionysius reign'd),
     two lofty turrets that command the town,
     i wonder how it could be conquer'd thus.

          enter a messenger.

     messenger. from barabas, malta's governor, i bring
     a message unto mighty calymath:
     hearing his sovereign was bound for sea,
     to sail to turkey, to great ottoman,
     he humbly would entreat your majesty
     to come and see his homely citadel,
     and banquet with him ere thou leav'st the isle.

     calymath. to banquet with him in his citadel!
     i fear me, messenger, to feast my train
     within a town of war so lately pillag'd,
     will be too costly and too troublesome:
     yet would i gladly

     messenger. selim, for that, thus saith the governor,--
     that he hath in [his] store a pearl so big,
     so precious, and withal so orient,
     as, be it valu'd but indifferently,
     the price thereof will serve to entertain
     selim and all his soldiers for a month;
     therefore he humbly would entreat your highness
     not to depart till he has feasted you.

     calymath. i cannot feast my men in malta-walls,
     except he place his tables in the streets.

     for happily i shall be in distress,

     first knight. rather than thus to live as turkish thralls,
     what will we not adventure?

     ferneze. on, then; be gone.

     knights. farewell, grave governor.

          on the other, ferneze.]

          enter, above, [200] barabas, with a hammer, very busy;
          and carpenters.

     barabas. how stand the cords? how hang these hinges? fast?
     are all the cranes and pulleys sure?

     first carpenter. [201] all fast.

     barabas. leave nothing loose, all levell'd to my mind.
     why, now i see that you have art, indeed:
     there, carpenters, divide that gold amongst you;

     that thou wilt come, and i am satisfied.

          enter messenger.

     now, sirrah; what, will he come?

     messenger. he will; and has commanded all his men
     to come ashore, and march through malta-streets,
     that thou mayst feast them in thy citadel.

     barabas. then now are all things as my wish would have 'em;
     there wanteth nothing but the governor's pelf;
     and see, he brings it.

          enter ferneze.

                             now, governor, the sum?

     ferneze. with free consent, a hundred thousand pounds.

     barabas. pounds say'st thou, governor? well, since it is no more,
     i'll satisfy myself with that; nay, keep it still,
     for, if i keep not promise, trust not me:
