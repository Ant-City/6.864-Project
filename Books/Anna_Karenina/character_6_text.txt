tuation," he reflected. "oh, oh,
oh!" he kept repeating in despair, as he remembered the acutely painful
sensations caused him by this quarrel.

most unpleasant of all was the first minute when, on coming, happy and
good-humored, from the theater, with a huge pear in his hand for his
wife, he had not found his wife in the drawing-room, to his surprise had
not found her in the study either, and saw her at last in her bedroom
with the unlucky letter that revealed everything in her hand.

she, his dolly, forever fussing and worrying over household details, and
limited in her ideas, as he considered, was sitting perfectly still with
the letter in her hand, looking at him with an expression of horror,
despair, and indignation.

"whatâ€™s this? this?" she asked, pointing to the letter.

and at this recollection, stepan arkadyevitch, as is so often the case,
was not so much annoyed at the fact itself as at the way in which he had
met his wifeâ€™s words.

there happened to him at that instant what

towards his wife by the discovery of his fault. instead of being hurt,
denying, defending himself, begging forgiveness, instead of remaining
indifferent evenâ€”anything would have been better than what he did doâ€”his
face utterly involuntarily (reflex spinal action, reflected stepan
arkadyevitch, who was fond of physiology)â€”utterly involuntarily assumed
its habitual, good-humored, and therefore idiotic smile.

this idiotic smile he could not forgive himself. catching sight of that
smile, dolly shuddered as though at physical pain, broke out with her
characteristic heat into a flood of cruel words, and rushed out of the
room. since then she had refused to see her husband.

"itâ€™s that idiotic smile thatâ€™s to blame for it all," thought stepan
arkadyevitch.

"but whatâ€™s to be done? whatâ€™s to be done?" he said to himself in
despair, and found no answer.

he others had almost gone without their dinner the day
before. she was conscious that it was impossible to go away; but,
cheating herself, she went on all the same sorting out her things and
pretending she was going.

seeing her husband, she dropped her hands into the drawer of the bureau
as though looking for something, and only looked round at him when he
had come quite up to her. but her face, to which she tried to give a
severe and resolute expression, betrayed bewilderment and suffering.

"dolly!" he said in a subdued and timid voice. he bent his head towards
his shoulder and tried to look pitiful and humble, but for all that he
was radiant with freshness and health. in a rapid glance she scanned his
figure that beamed with health and freshness. "yes, he is happy and
content!" she thought; "while i.... and that disgusting good nature,
which every one likes him for and praisesâ€”i hate that good nature of
his," she thought. her mouth stiffened, the muscles of the cheek
contracted on the

 right side of her pale, nervous face.

"what do you want?" she said in a rapid, deep, unnatural voice.

"dolly!" he repeated, with a quiver in his voice. "anna is coming
today."

"well, what is that to me? i canâ€™t see her!" she cried.

"but you must, really, dolly..."

"go away, go away, go away!" she shrieked, not looking at him, as though
this shriek were called up by physical pain.

stepan arkadyevitch could be calm when he thought of his wife, he could
hope that she would _come round_, as matvey expressed it, and could
quietly go on reading his paper and drinking his coffee; but when he saw
her tortured, suffering face, heard the tone of her voice, submissive to
fate and full of despair, there was a catch in his breath and a lump in
his throat, and h

is eyes began to shine with tears.

"my god! what have i done? dolly! for godâ€™s sake!.... you know...." he
could not go on; there was a sob in his throat.

she shut the bureau with a slam, and glanced at him.

"dolly, what can i say?.... one thing: forgive... remember, cannot nine
years of my life atone for an instant...."

she dropped her eyes and listened, expecting what he would say, as it
were beseeching him in some way or other to make her believe
differently.

"â€”instant of passion?" he said, and would have gone on, but at that
word, as at a pang of physical pain, her lips stiffened again, and again
the muscles of her right cheek worked.

"go away, go out of the room!" she shrieked still more shrilly
 
 ___________________________
 
, "and
donâ€™t talk to me of your passion and your loathsomeness."

she tried to go out, but tottered, and clung to the back of a chair to
support herself. his face relaxed, his lips swelled, his eyes were
swimming with tears.

"dolly!" he said, sobbing now; "for mercyâ€™s sake, think of the children;
they are not to blame! i am to blame, and punish me, make me expiate my
fault. anything i can do, i am ready to do anything! i am to blame, no
words can express how much i am to blame! but, dolly, forgive me!"

she sat down. he listened to her hard, heavy breathing, and he was
unutterably sorry for her. she tried several times to begin to speak,
but could not. he waited.

"you remember the children, stiva, to play with them; but i remember
them, and know that this means their ruin," she saidâ€”obviously one of
the phrases she had more than once repeated to herself in the course of
the last few days.

she had called him "stiva," and he glanced at her with gratitude, and
moved to take her

 he thought.

"it is awful! awful!" he said.

at that moment in the next room a child began to cry; probably it had
fallen down. darya alexandrovna listened, and her face suddenly
softened.

she seemed to be pulling herself together for a few seconds, as though
she did not know where she was, and what she was doing, and getting up
rapidly, she moved towards the door.

"well, she loves my child," he thought, noticing the change of her face
at the childâ€™s cry, "my child: how can she hate me?"

"dolly, one word more," he said, following her.

"if you come near me, i will call in the servants, the children! they
may all know you are a scoundrel! i am going away at once, and you may
live here with your mistress!"

and she went out, slamming the door.

stepan arkadyevitch sighed, wiped his face, and with a subdued tread
walked out of the room. "matvey says she will come round; but how? i
donâ€™t see the least chance of it. ah, oh, how horrible it is! and how
vulgarly she shouted," he said to hi

and was furious with himself for blushing, because he could not answer,
"i have come to make your sister-in-law an offer," though that was
precisely what he had come for.

the families of the levins and the shtcherbatskys were old, noble moscow
families, and had always been on intimate and friendly terms. this
intimacy had grown still closer during levinâ€™s student days. he had both
prepared for the university with the young prince shtcherbatsky, the
brother of kitty and dolly, and had entered at the same time with him.
in those days levin used often to be in the shtcherbatskysâ€™ house, and
he was in love with the shtcherbatsky household. strange as it may
appear, it was with the household, the family, that konstantin levin was
in love, especially with the feminine half of the household. levin did
not remember his own mother, and his only sister was older than he was,
so that it was in the shtcherbatskysâ€™ house that he saw for the first
time that inner life of an

literature, of music, of drawing, of dancing; why at certain hours all
the three young ladies, with mademoiselle linon, drove in the coach to
the tversky boulevard, dressed in their satin cloaks, dolly in a long
one, natalia in a half-long one, and kitty in one so short that her
shapely legs in tightly-drawn red stockings were visible to all
beholders; why it was they had to walk about the tversky boulevard
escorted by a footman with a gold cockade in his hatâ€”all this and much
more that was done in their mysterious world he did not understand, but

was in love precisely with the mystery of the proceedings.

 then?"

"we shall be pleased to see you," the princess said stiffly.

this stiffness hurt kitty, and she could not resist the desire to smooth
over her motherâ€™s coldness. she turned her head, and with a smile said:

"good-bye till this evening."

at that moment stepan arkadyevitch, his hat cocked on one side, with
beaming face and eyes, strode into the garden like a conquering hero.
but as he approached his mother-in-law, he responded in a mournful and
crestfallen tone to her inquiries about dollyâ€™s health. after a little
subdued and dejected conversation with his mother-in-law, he threw out
his chest again, and put his arm in levinâ€™s.

"well, shall we set off?" he asked. "iâ€™ve been thinking about you all
this time, and iâ€™m very, very glad youâ€™ve come," he said, looking him in
the face with a significant air.

"yes, come along," answered levin in ecstasy, hearing unceasingly the
sound of that voice saying, "good-bye till this evening," and seeing the

but her mother saw them in a different light. she knew that the old lady
was expected from day to day, that she would be pleased at her sonâ€™s
choice, and she felt it strange that he should not make his offer
through fear of vexing his mother. however, she was so anxious for the
marriage itself, and still more for relief from her fears, that she
believed it was so. bitter as it was for the princess to see the
unhappiness of her eldest daughter, dolly, on the point of leaving her
husband, her anxiety over the decision of her youngest daughterâ€™s fate
engrossed all her feelings. today, with levinâ€™s reappearance, a fresh
source of anxiety arose. she was afraid that her daughter, who had at
one time, as she fancied, a feeling for levin, might, from extreme sense
of honor, refuse vronsky, and that levinâ€™s arrival might generally
complicate and delay the affair so near being concluded.

"why, has he been here long?" the princess asked about

at each word. "and this
is how weâ€™re preparing wretchedness for kitty; and sheâ€™s really got the
notion into her head..."

"but what makes you suppose so?"

"i donâ€™t suppose; i know. we have eyes for such things, though
women-folk havenâ€™t. i see a man who has serious intentions, thatâ€™s
levin: and i see a peacock, like this feather-head, whoâ€™s only amusing
himself."

"oh, well, when once you get an idea into your head!..."

"well, youâ€™ll remember my words, but too late, just as with dolly."

"well, well, we wonâ€™t talk of it," the princess stopped him,
recollecting her unlucky dolly.

"by all means, and good night!"

and signing each other with the cross, the husband and wife parted with
a kiss, feeling that they each remained of their own opinion.

the princess had at first been quite certain that that evening had
settled kittyâ€™s future, and that there could be no doubt of vronskyâ€™s
intentions, but her husbandâ€™s words had disturbed her. and returning to
her own room, in

tossing her head, as though she would physically shake off something
superfluous oppressing her. "let us talk of your affairs. i got your
letter, and here i am."

"yes, all my hopes are in you," said stepan arkadyevitch.

"well, tell me all about it."

and stepan arkadyevitch began to tell his story.

on reaching home oblonsky helped his sister out, sighed, pressed her
hand, and set off to his office.



chapter 19


when anna went into the room, dolly was sitting in the little
drawing-room with a white-headed fat little boy, already like his
father, giving him a lesson in french reading. as the boy read, he kept
twisting and trying to tear off a button that was nearly off his jacket.
his mother had several times taken his hand from it, but the fat little
hand went back to the button again. his mother pulled the button off and
put it in her pocket.

"keep your hands still, grisha," she said, and she took up her work, a
coverlet she had long b

een making. she always set to work on it at
depressed moments, and now she knitted at it nervously, twitching her
fingers and counting the stitches. though she had sent word the day
before to her husband that it was nothing to her whether his sister came
or not, she had made everything ready for her arrival, and was expecting
her sister-in-law with emotion.

dolly was crushed by her sorrow, utterly swallowed up by it. still she
did not forget that anna, her sister-in-law, was the wife of one of the
most important personages in petersburg, and was a petersburg _grande
dame_. and, thanks to this circumstance, she did not carry out her
threat to her husbandâ€”that is to say, she remembered that her
sister-in-law was coming. "and, after all, anna is in no wise to blame,"
thought dolly. "i know nothing of her except the very best, and i have
seen nothing but 
 
 ___________________________
 
kindness and affection from her towards myself." it was
true that as far as she could recall her impressions at petersburg at
the kareninsâ€™, she did not like their household itself; there was
something artificial in the whole framework of their family life. "but
why should i not receive her? if only she doesnâ€™t take it into her head
to console me!" thought dolly. "all consolation and counsel and
christian forgiveness, all that i have thought over a thousand times,
and itâ€™s all no use."

all these days dolly had been alone with her children. she did not want
to talk of her sorrow, but with that sorrow in her heart she could not
talk of outside matters. she knew that in one way or another she would
tell anna everything, and she was alternately glad at the thought of
speaking freely, and angry at the necessity of speaking of her
humiliation with her, hi

er, and of hearing her ready-made phrases
of good advice and comfort. she had been on the lookout for her,
glancing at her watch every minute, and, as so often happens, let slip
just that minute when her visitor arrived, so that she did not hear the
bell.

catching a sound of skirts and light steps at the door, she looked
round, and her care-worn face unconsciously expressed not gladness, but
wonder. she got up and embraced her sister-in-law.

"what, here already!" she said as she kissed her.

"dolly, how glad i am to see you!"

"i am glad, too," said dolly, faintly smiling, and trying by the
expression of annaâ€™s face to find out whether she knew. "most likely she
knows," she thought, noticing the sympathy in annaâ€™s face. "well, come
along, iâ€™ll take you to your room," she went on, trying to defer as long
as possible the moment of confidences.

"is this grisha? heavens, how heâ€™s grown!" said anna; and kissing him,
never taking her eyes off dolly, she stood still and flushed a little

.
"no, please, let us stay here."

she took off her kerchief and her hat, and catching it in a lock of her
black hair, which was a mass of curls, she tossed her head and shook her
hair down.

"you are radiant with health and happiness!" said dolly, almost with
envy.

"i?.... yes," said anna. "merciful heavens, tanya! youâ€™re the same age
as my seryozha," she added, addressing the little girl as she ran in.
she took her in her arms and kissed her. "delightful child, delightful!
show me them all."

she mentioned them, not only remembering the names, but the years,
months, characters, illnesses of all the children, and dolly could not
but appreciate that.

"very well, we will go to them," she said. "itâ€™s a pity vassyaâ€™s
asleep."

after

 seeing the children, they sat down, alone now, in the drawing
room, to coffee. anna took the tray, and then pushed it away from her.

"dolly," she said, "he has told me."

dolly looked coldly at anna; she was waiting now for phrases of
conventional sympathy, but anna said nothing of the sort.

"dolly, dear," she said, "i donâ€™t want to speak for him to you, nor to
try to comfort you; thatâ€™s impossible. but, darling, iâ€™m simply sorry,
sorry from my heart for you!"

under the thick lashes of her shining eyes tears suddenly glittered. she
moved nearer to her sister-in-law and took her hand in her vigorous
little hand. dolly did not shrink away, but her face did not lose its
frigid expression. she said:

"to comfort meâ€™s impossible. everythingâ€™s lost after what has happened,
everything
 
 ___________________________
 
â€™s over!"

and directly she had said this, her face suddenly softened. anna lifted
the wasted, thin hand of dolly, kissed it and said:

"but, dolly, whatâ€™s to be done, whatâ€™s to be done? how is it best to act
in this awful positionâ€”thatâ€™s what you must think of."

"allâ€™s over, and thereâ€™s nothing more," said dolly. "and the worst of
all is, you see, that i canâ€™t cast him off: there are the children, i am
tied. and i canâ€™t live with him! itâ€™s a torture to me to see him."

"dolly, darling, he has spoken to me, but i want to hear it from you:
tell me about it."

dolly looked at her inquiringly.

sympathy and love unfeigned were visible on annaâ€™s face.

"very well," she said all at once. "but i will tell you it from the
beginning. you know how i was married. with the education mamma gave us
i was more than innocent, i was stupid. i knew nothing. i know they say
men tell their wives of their former lives, but stiva"â€”she corrected
herselfâ€”"stepan arkadyevitch told me 
 
 ___________________________
 
nothing. youâ€™ll hardly believe it,
but till now i imagined that i was the only woman he had known. so i
lived eight years. you must understand that i was so far from suspecting
infidelity, i regarded it as impossible, and thenâ€”try to imagine itâ€”with
such ideas, to find out suddenly all the horror, all the
loathsomeness.... you must try and understand me. to be fully convinced
of oneâ€™s happiness, and all at once..." continued dolly, holding back
her sobs, "to get a letter ... his letter to his mistress, my governess.
no, itâ€™s too awful!" she hastily pulled out her handkerchief and hid her
face in it. "i can understand being carried away by feeling," she went
on after a brief silence, "but deliberately, slyly deceiving me ... and
with whom?... to go on being my husband together with her ... itâ€™s
awful! you canâ€™t understand..."

"oh, yes, i understand! i understand! dolly, dearest, i do understand,"
said anna, pressin

g her hand.

"and do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position?" dolly
resumed. "not the slightest! heâ€™s happy and contented."

"oh, no!" anna interposed quickly. "heâ€™s to be pitied, heâ€™s weighed down
by remorse..."

"is he capable of remorse?" dolly interrupted, gazing intently into her
sister-in-lawâ€™s face.

"yes. i know him. i could not look at him without feeling sorry for him.
we both know him. heâ€™s good-hearted, but heâ€™s proud, and now heâ€™s so
humiliated. what touched me most..." (and here anna guessed what would
touch dolly most) "heâ€™s tortured by two things: that heâ€™s ashamed for
the childrenâ€™s sake, and that, loving youâ€”yes, yes, loving you beyond
everything on earth," she hurriedly interrupted dolly, who would have

answeredâ€”"he has hurt you, pierced you to the heart. â€˜no, no, she cannot
forgive me,â€™ he keeps saying."

dolly looked dreamily away beyond her sister-in-law as she listened to
her words.

"yes, i can see that his position is awful; itâ€™s worse for the guilty
than the innocent," she said, "if he feels that all the misery comes
from his fault. but how am i to forgive him, how am i to be his wife
again after her? for me to live with him now would be torture, just
because i love my past love for him..."

and sobs cut short her words. but as though of set design, each time she
was softened she began to spea

hat he will tell me.... what! can i believe him? never! no,
everything is over, everything that once made my comfort, the reward of
my work, and my sufferings.... would you believe it, i was teaching
grisha just now: once this was a joy to me, now it is a torture. what
have i to strive and toil for? why are the children here? whatâ€™s so
awful is that all at once my heartâ€™s turned, and instead of love and
tenderness, i have nothing but hatred for him; yes, hatred. i could kill
him."

"darling dolly, i understand, but donâ€™t torture yourself. you are so
distressed, so overwrought, that you look at many things mistakenly."

dolly grew calmer, and for two minutes both were silent.

"whatâ€™s to be done? think for me, anna, help me. i have thought over
everything, and i see nothing."

anna could think of nothing, but her heart responded instantly to each
word, to each change of expression of her sister-in-law.

"one thing i would say," began anna. "i am his sister, i know his
character, that
 
 ___________________________
 
 faculty of forgetting everything, everything" (she waved
her hand before her forehead), "that faculty for being completely
carried away, but for completely repenting too. he cannot believe it, he
cannot comprehend now how he can have acted as he did."

"no; he understands, he understood!" dolly broke in. "but i ... you are
forgetting me ... does it make it easier for me?"

"wait a minute. when he told me, i will own i did not realize all the
awfulness of your position. i saw nothing but him, and that the family
was broken up. i felt sorry for him, but after talking to you, i see it,
as a woman, quite differently. i see your agony, and i canâ€™t tell you
how sorry i am for you! but, dolly, darling, i fully realize your
sufferings, only there is one thing i donâ€™t know; i donâ€™t know

... i
donâ€™t know how much love there is still in your heart for him. that you
knowâ€”whether there is enough for you to be able to forgive him. if there
is, forgive him!"

"no," dolly was beginning, but anna cut her short, kissing her hand once
more.

"i know more of the world than you do," she said. "i know how men like
stiva look at it. you speak of his talking of you with her. that never
happened. such men are unfaithful, but their home and wife are sacred to
them. somehow or other these women are still looked on with contempt by
them, and do not touch on their feeling for their family. they draw a
sort of line that canâ€™t be crossed between them and their families. i
do
 
 ___________________________
 
nâ€™t understand it, but it is so."

"yes, but he has kissed her..."

"dolly, hush, darling. i saw stiva when he was in love with you. i
remember the time when he came to me and cried, talking of you, and all
the poetry and loftiness of his feeling for you, and i know that the
longer he has lived with you the loftier you have been in his eyes. you
know we have sometimes laughed at him for putting in at every word:
â€˜dollyâ€™s a marvelous woman.â€™ you have always been a divinity for him,
and you are that still, and this has not been an infidelity of the
heart..."

"but if it is repeated?"

"it cannot be, as i understand it..."

"yes, but could you forgive it?"

"i donâ€™t know, i canâ€™t judge.... yes, i can," said anna, thinking a
moment; and grasping the position in her thought and weighing it in her
inner balance, she added: "yes, i can, i can, i can. yes, i could
forgive it. i could not be the same, no; but 
 
 ___________________________
 
i could forgive it, and
forgive it as though it had never been, never been at all..."

"oh, of course," dolly interposed quickly, as though saying what she had
more than once thought, "else it would not be forgiveness. if one
forgives, it must be completely, completely. come, let us go; iâ€™ll take
you to your room," she said, getting up, and on the way she embraced
anna. "my dear, how glad i am you came. it has made things better, ever
so much better."

already heard of her arrival, and came to call the same day. anna spent
the whole morning with dolly and the children. she merely sent a brief
note to her brother to tell him that he must not fail to dine at home.
"come, god is merciful," she wrote.

oblonsky did dine at home: the conversation was general, and his wife,
speaking to him, addressed him as "stiva," as she had not done before.
in the relations of the husband and wife the same estrangement still
remained, but there was no talk now of separation, and stepan
arkadyevitch saw the possibility of explanation and reconciliation.

 years old. in the elasticity of her movements, the freshness and
the unflagging eagerness which persisted in her face, and broke out in
her smile and her glance, she would rather have passed for a girl of
twenty, had it not been for a serious and at times mournful look in her
eyes, which struck and attracted kitty. kitty felt that anna was
perfectly simple and was concealing nothing, but that she had another
higher world of interests inaccessible to her, complex and poetic.

after dinner, when dolly went away to her own room, anna rose quickly
and went up to her brother, who was just lighting a cigar.

"stiva," she said to him, winking gaily, crossing him and glancing
towards the door, "go, and god help you."

he threw down the cigar, understanding her, and departed through the
doorway.

when stepan arkadyevitch had disappeared, she went back to the sofa
where she had been sitting, surrounded by the children. either because
the children saw that their mother was fond of this aunt, or that

the water. heâ€™s a hero, in fact," said anna, smiling and recollecting
the two hundred roubles he had given at the station.

but she did not tell kitty about the two hundred roubles. for some
reason it was disagreeable to her to think of it. she felt that there
was something that had to do with her in it, and something that ought
not to have been.

"she pressed me very much to go and see her," anna went on; "and i shall
be glad to go to see her tomorrow. stiva is staying a long while in
dollyâ€™s room, thank god," anna added, changing the subject, and getting
up, kitty fancied, displeased with something.

"no, iâ€™m first! no, i!" screamed the children, who had finished tea,
running up to their aunt anna.

"all together," said anna, and she ran laughing to meet them, and
embraced and swung round all the throng of swarming children, shrieking
with delight.



chapter 21


dolly came out of her room to the tea of the grown-up people. stepan
arkadyevitch did not come out. he must have

left his wifeâ€™s room by the
other door.

"i am afraid youâ€™ll be cold upstairs," observed dolly, addressing anna;
"i want to move you downstairs, and we shall be nearer."

"oh, please, donâ€™t trouble about me," answered anna, looking intently
into dollyâ€™s face, trying to make out whether there had been a
reconciliation or not.

"it will be lighter for you here," answered her sister-in-law.

"i assure you that i sleep everywhere, and always like a marmot."

"whatâ€™s the question?" inquired stepan arkadyevitch, coming out of his
room and addressing his wife.

from his tone both kitty and anna knew that a reconciliation had taken
place.

"i want to move anna downstairs, but we must hang up blinds. no one
knows how to do it; i must see to it my

self," answered dolly addressing
him.

"god knows whether they are fully reconciled," thought anna, hearing her
tone, cold and composed.

"oh, nonsense, dolly, always making difficulties," answered her husband.
"come, iâ€™ll do it all, if you like..."

"yes, they must be reconciled," thought anna.

"i know how you do everything," answered dolly. "you tell matvey to do
what canâ€™t be done, and go away yourself, leaving him to make a muddle
of everything," and her habitual, mocking smile curved the corners of
dollyâ€™s lips as she spoke.

"full, full reconciliation, full," thought anna; "thank god!" and
rejoicing that she was the cause of it, she went up to dolly and kissed
her.

"not at all. why do you always look down on me and matvey?" said stepan
arkadyevitch, smiling hardly perceptibly, and addressing his wife.

dolly was, as always, a little mocking in her tone to
her husband, while stepan arkadyevitch was happy and cheerful, but not
so as to seem as though, having been forgiven, he had forgotten his
offense.

at half-past nine oâ€™clock a particularly joyful and pleasant family
conversation over the tea-table at the oblonskysâ€™ was broken up by an
apparently simple incident. but this simple incident for some reason
struck everyone as strange. talking about common acquaintances in
petersburg, anna got up q

all put him to bed herself, she felt depressed
at being so far from him; and whatever she was talking about, she kept
coming back in thought to her curly-headed seryozha. she longed to look
at his photograph and talk of him. seizing the first pretext, she got
up, and with her light, resolute step went for her album. the stairs up
to her room came out on the landing of the great warm main staircase.

just as she was leaving the drawing room, a ring was heard in the hall.

"who can that be?" said dolly.

"itâ€™s early for me to be fetched, and for anyone else itâ€™s late,"
observed kitty.

"sure to be someone with papers for me," put in stepan arkadyevitch.
when anna was passing the top of the staircase, a servant was running up
to announce the visitor, while the visitor himself was standing under a
lamp. anna glancing down at once recognized vronsky, and a strange
feeling of pleasure and at the same time of dread of something stirred
in her heart. he was standing still, not taking off his co

morning, anna arkadyevna sent her husband a
telegram that she was leaving moscow the same day.

"no, i must go, i must go"; she explained to her sister-in-law the
change in her plans in a tone that suggested that she had to remember so
many things that there was no enumerating them: "no, it had really
better be today!"

stepan arkadyevitch was not dining at home, but he promised to come and
see his sister off at seven oâ€™clock.

kitty, too, did not come, sending a note that she had a headache. dolly
and anna dined alone with the children and the english governess.
whether it was that the children were fickle, or that they had acute
senses, and felt that anna was quite different that day from what she
had been when they had taken such a fancy to her, that she was not now
interested in them,â€”but they had abruptly dropped their play with their
aunt, and their love for her, and were quite indifferent that she was
going away. anna was absorbed the whole morning in preparations for her

re. she wrote notes to her moscow acquaintances, put down her
accounts, and packed. altogether dolly fancied she was not in a placid
state of mind, but in that worried mood, which dolly knew well with
herself, and which does not come without cause, and for the most part
covers dissatisfaction with self. after dinner, anna went up to her room
to dress, and dolly followed her.

"how queer you are today!" dolly said to her.

"i? do you think so? iâ€™m not queer, but iâ€™m nasty. i am like that
sometimes. i keep feeling as if i could cry. itâ€™s very stupid, but itâ€™ll
pass off," said anna quickly, and she bent her flushed face over a tiny
bag in which she was packing a nightcap and some cambric handkerchiefs.
her eyes were particularly bright, and were continually swimming with
tears. "in the same way i didnâ€™t want to leave petersburg, and now i
donâ€™t want to go away from here."

"you came here a

nd did a good deed," said dolly, looking intently at
her.

anna looked at her with eyes wet with tears.

"donâ€™t say that, dolly. iâ€™ve done nothing, and could do nothing. i often
wonder why people are all in league to spoil me. what have i done, and
what could i do? in your heart there was found love enough to
forgive..."

"if it had not been for you, god knows what would have happened! how
happy you are, anna!" said dolly. "everything is clear and good in your
heart."

"every heart has its own _skeletons_, as the english say."

"you have no sort of _skeleton_, have you? everything is so clear in
you."

"i have!" said anna suddenly, and, unexpectedly after her tears, a sly,
ironical smile curved her lips.

"come, heâ€™s amusing, anyway, your _skeleton_, and not depressing," said
dolly, smiling.

"no, heâ€™s depressing. do you know why iâ€™m going today instead of
tomorrow? itâ€™s a confession that weighs on me; i

 want to make it to
you," said anna, letting herself drop definitely into an armchair, and
looking straight into dollyâ€™s face.

and to her surprise dolly saw that anna was blushing up to her ears, up
to the curly black ringlets on her neck.

"yes," anna went on. "do you know why kitty didnâ€™t come to dinner? sheâ€™s
jealous of me. i have spoiled ... iâ€™ve been the cause of that ball being
a torture to her instead of a pleasure. but truly, truly, itâ€™s not my
fault, or only my fault a little bit," she said, daintily drawling the
words "a little bit."

"oh, how like stiva you said that!" said dolly, laughing.

anna was hurt.

"oh no, oh no! iâ€

e words, she felt that they
were not true. she was not merely doubting herself, she felt emotion at
the thought of vronsky, and was going away sooner than she had meant,
simply to avoid meeting him.

"yes, stiva told me you danced the mazurka with him, and that he..."

"you canâ€™t imagine how absurdly it all came about. i only meant to be
matchmaking, and all at once it turned out quite differently. possibly
against my own will..."

she crimsoned and stopped.

"oh, they feel it directly?" said dolly.

"but i should be in despair if there were anything serious in it on his
side," anna interrupted her. "and i am certain it will all be forgotten,
and kitty will leave off hating me."

"all the same, anna, to tell you the truth, iâ€™m not very anxious for
this marriage for kitty. and itâ€™s better it should come to nothing, if
he, vronsky, is capable of falling in love with you in a single day."

"oh, heavens, that would be too silly!" said anna, and again a deep
flush of pleasure came out on h

er face, when she heard the idea, that
absorbed her, put into words. "and so here i am going away, having made
an enemy of kitty, whom i liked so much! ah, how sweet she is! but
youâ€™ll make it right, dolly? eh?"

dolly could scarcely suppress a smile. she loved anna, but she enjoyed
seeing that she too had her weaknesses.

"an enemy? that canâ€™t be."

"i did so want you all to care for me, as i do for you, and now i care
for you more than ever," said anna, with tears in her eyes. "ah, how
silly i am today!"

she passed her handkerchief over her face and began dressing.

at the very moment of starting stepan arkadyevitch arrived, late, rosy
and good-humored, smelling of wine and cigars.

annaâ€™s emotionalism

 infected dolly, and when she embraced her
sister-in-law for the last time, she whispered: "remember, anna, what
youâ€™ve done for meâ€”i shall never forget. and remember that i love you,
and shall always love you as my dearest friend!"

"i donâ€™t know why," said anna, kissing her and hiding her tears.

"you understood me, and you understand. good-bye, my darling!"

she had imagined him better than he was in reality. she
had to let herself drop down to the reality to enjoy him as he really
was. but even as he was, he was charming, with his fair curls, his blue
eyes, and his plump, graceful little legs in tightly pulled-up
stockings. anna experienced almost physical pleasure in the sensation of
his nearness, and his caresses, and moral soothing, when she met his
simple, confiding, and loving glance, and heard his naÃ¯ve questions.
anna took out the presents dollyâ€™s children had sent him, and told her
son what sort of little girl was tanya at moscow, and how tanya could
read, and even taught the other children.

"why, am i not so nice as she?" asked seryozha.

"to me youâ€™re nicer than anyone in the world."

"i know that," said seryozha, smiling.

anna had not had time to drink her coffee when the countess lidia
ivanovna was announced. the countess lidia ivanovna was a tall, stout
woman, with an unhealthily sallow face and splendid, pensive black eyes

actly at half-past nine she heard his ring,
and he came into the room.

"here you are at last!" she observed, holding out her hand to him.

he kissed her hand and sat down beside her.

"altogether then, i see your visit was a success," he said to her.

"oh, yes," she said, and she began telling him about everything from the
beginning: her journey with countess vronskaya, her arrival, the
accident at the station. then she described the pity she had felt, first
for her brother, and afterwards for dolly.

"i imagine one cannot exonerate such a man from blame, though he is your
brother," said alexey alexandrovitch severely.

anna smiled. she knew that he said that simply to show that family
considerations could not prevent him from expressing his genuine
opinion. she knew that characteristic in her husband, and liked it.

"i am glad it has all ended so satisfactorily, and that you are back
again," he went on. "come, what do they say about the new act i have got

he pressed her hand, and again kissed it.

"all the same heâ€™s a good man; truthful, good-hearted, and remarkable in
his own line," anna said to herself going back to her room, as though
she were defending him to someone who had attacked him and said that one
could not love him. "but why is it his ears stick out so strangely? or
has he had his hair cut?"

precisely at twelve oâ€™clock, when anna was still sitting at her writing
table, finishing a letter to dolly, she heard the sound of measured
steps in slippers, and alexey alexandrovitch, freshly washed and combed,
with a book under his arm, came in to her.

"itâ€™s time, itâ€™s time," said he, with a meaning smile, and he went into
their bedroom.

"and what right had he to look at him like that?" thought anna,
recalling vronskyâ€™s glance at alexey alexandrovitch.

undressing, she went into the bedroom; but her face had none of the
eagerness which, during her stay in moscow, had fairly flashed from h

any need.

it seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after
the doctor had gone. the mother was much more cheerful when she went
back to her daughter, and kitty pretended to be more cheerful. she had
often, almost always, to be pretending now.

"really, iâ€™m quite well, mamma. but if you want to go abroad, letâ€™s go!"
she said, and trying to appear interested in the proposed tour, she
began talking of the preparations for the journey.



chapter 2


soon after the doctor, dolly had arrived. she knew that there was to be
a consultation that day, and though she was only just up after her
confinement (she had another baby, a little girl, born at the end of the
winter), though she had trouble and anxiety enough of her own, she had
left her tiny baby and a sick child, to come and hear kittyâ€™s fate,
which was to be decided that day.

"well, well?" she said, coming into the drawing room, without taking off
her hat. "youâ€™re all in good spirits. good news, then?"

they tri

ed to tell her what the doctor had said, but it appeared that
though the doctor had talked distinctly enough and at great length, it
was utterly impossible to report what he had said. the only point of
interest was that it was settled they should go abroad.

dolly could not help sighing. her dearest friend, her sister, was going
away. and her life was not a cheerful one. her relations with stepan
arkadyevitch after their reconciliation had become humiliating. the
union anna had cemented turned out to be of no solid character, and
family harmony was breaking down again at the same point. there had been
nothing definite, but stepan arkadyevitch was hardly ever at home;
money, too, was hardly ever forthcoming, and dolly was continually
tortured by suspicion

did not go well, then the nurse had gone away, now one of the children
had fallen ill.

"well, how are all of you?" asked her mother.

"ah, mamma, we have plenty of troubles of our own. lili is ill, and iâ€™m
afraid itâ€™s scarlatina. i have come here now to hear about kitty, and
then i shall shut myself up entirely, ifâ€”god forbidâ€”it should be
scarlatina."

the old prince too had come in from his study after the doctorâ€™s
departure, and after presenting his cheek to dolly, and saying a few
words to her, he turned to his wife:

"how have you settled it? youâ€™re going? well, and what do you mean to do
with me?"

"i suppose you had better stay here, alexander," said his wife.

"thatâ€™s as you like."

"mamma, why shouldnâ€™t father come with us?" said kitty. "it would be
nicer for him and for us too."

the old prince got up and stroked kittyâ€™s hair. she lifted her head and
looked at him with a forced smile. it always seemed to her that he
understood her better t

glance met his
blue kindly eyes looking intently at her, it seemed to her that he saw
right through her, and understood all that was not good that was passing
within her. reddening, she stretched out towards him expecting a kiss,
but he only patted her hair and said:

"these stupid chignons! thereâ€™s no getting at the real daughter. one
simply strokes the bristles of dead women. well, dolinka," he turned to
his elder daughter, "whatâ€™s your young buck about, hey?"

"nothing, father," answered dolly, understanding that her husband was
meant. "heâ€™s always out; i scarcely ever see him," she could not resist
adding with a sarcastic smile.

"why, hasnâ€™t he gone into the country yetâ€”to see about selling that
forest?"

"no, heâ€™s still getting ready for the journey."

"oh, thatâ€™s it!" said the prince. "and so am i to be getting ready for a
journey too? at your service," he said to his wife, sitting down. "and i
tell you what, katia," he went on to his younger daughter, "you must

ee what comes of your jokes!" the princess pounced down on her
husband. "youâ€™re always..." she began a string of reproaches.

the prince listened to the princessâ€™s scolding rather a long while
without speaking, but his face was more and more frowning.

"sheâ€™s so much to be pitied, poor child, so much to be pitied, and you
donâ€™t feel how it hurts her to hear the slightest reference to the cause
of it. ah! to be so mistaken in people!" said the princess, and by the
change in her tone both dolly and the prince knew she was speaking of
vronsky. "i donâ€™t know why there arenâ€™t laws against such base,
dishonorable people."

"ah, i canâ€™t bear to hear you!" said the prince gloomily, getting up
from his low chair, and seeming anxious to get away, yet stopping in the
doorway. "there are laws, madam, and since youâ€™ve challenged me to it,
iâ€™ll tell you whoâ€™s to blame for it all: you and you, you and nobody
else. laws against such young gallants there have always been, and there

 whispered, moving to him and beginning to
weep.

as soon as she began to cry the prince too calmed down. he went up to
her.

"there, thatâ€™s enough, thatâ€™s enough! youâ€™re wretched too, i know. it
canâ€™t be helped. thereâ€™s no great harm done. god is merciful ...
thanks..." he said, not knowing what he was saying, as he responded to
the tearful kiss of the princess that he felt on his hand. and the
prince went out of the room.

before this, as soon as kitty went out of the room in tears, dolly, with
her motherly, family instincts, had promptly perceived that here a
womanâ€™s work lay before her, and she prepared to do it. she took off her
hat, and, morally speaking, tucked up her sleeves and prepared for
action. while her mother was attacking her father, she tried to restrain
her mother, so far as filial reverence would allow. during the princeâ€™s
outburst she was silent; she felt ashamed for her mother, and tender
towards her father for so quickly being kind again. but when her fat

think how she had sinned against
her daughter, and she broke out angrily.

"oh, i really donâ€™t understand! nowadays they will all go their own way,
and mothers havenâ€™t a word to say in anything, and then..."

"mamma, iâ€™ll go up to her."

"well, do. did i tell you not to?" said her mother.



chapter 3


when she went into kittyâ€™s little room, a pretty, pink little room, full
of knick-knacks in _vieux saxe,_ as fresh, and pink, and white, and gay
as kitty herself had been two months ago, dolly remembered how they had
decorated the room the year before together, with what love and gaiety.
her heart turned cold when she saw kitty sitting on a low chair near the
door, her eyes fixed immovably on a corner of the rug. kitty glanced at
her sister, and the cold, rather ill-tempered expression of her face did
not change.

"iâ€™m just going now, and i shall have to keep in and you wonâ€™t be able
to come to see me," said dolly, sitting down beside her. "i want to talk
to you."

"what about?" 
 
 ___________________________
 
" said kitty, in a breaking
voice. "donâ€™t talk of it! please, donâ€™t talk of it!"

"but who can have told you so? no one has said that. iâ€™m certain he was
in love with you, and would still be in love with you, if it hadnâ€™t...

"oh, the most awful thing of all for me is this sympathizing!" shrieked
kitty, suddenly flying into a passion. she turned round on her chair,
flushed crimson, and rapidly moving her fingers, pinched the clasp of
her belt first with one hand and then with the other. dolly knew this
trick her sister had of clenching her hands when she was much excited;
she knew, too, that in moments of excitement kitty was capable of
forgetting herself and saying a great deal too much, and dolly would
have soothed her, but it was too late.

"what, what is it you want to make me feel, eh?" said kitty quickly.
"that iâ€™ve been in love with a man who didnâ€™t care a straw for me, and
that iâ€™m dying of love for him? and this is said to me by my own sister,
who imagines that ... th

. she leaped up from her chair, and flinging her clasp on
the ground, she gesticulated rapidly with her hands and said:

"why bring levin in too? i canâ€™t understand what you want to torment me
for. iâ€™ve told you, and i say it again, that i have some pride, and
never, _never_ would i do as youâ€™re doingâ€”go back to a man whoâ€™s
deceived you, who has cared for another woman. i canâ€™t understand it!
you may, but i canâ€™t!"

and saying these words she glanced at her sister, and seeing that dolly
sat silent, her head mournfully bowed, kitty, instead of running out of
the room as she had meant to do, sat down near the door, and hid her
face in her handkerchief.

the silence lasted for two minutes: dolly was thinking of herself. that
humiliation of which she was always conscious came back to her with a
peculiar bitterness when her sister reminded her of it. she had not
looked for such cruelty in her sister, and she was angry with her. but
suddenly she heard the rustle of a skirt, and with

alexandrovnaâ€™s skirt.

as though tears were the indispensable oil, without which the machinery
of mutual confidence could not run smoothly between the two sisters, the
sisters after their tears talked, not of what was uppermost in their
minds, but, though they talked of outside matters, they understood each
other. kitty knew that the words she had uttered in anger about her
husbandâ€™s infidelity and her humiliating position had cut her poor
sister to the heart, but that she had forgiven her. dolly for her part
knew all she had wanted to find out. she felt certain that her surmises
were correct; that kittyâ€™s misery, her inconsolable misery, was due
precisely to the fact that levin had made her an offer and she had
refused him, and vronsky had deceived her, and that she was fully
prepared to love levin and to detest vronsky. kitty said not a word of
that; she talked of nothing but her spiritual condition.

"i have nothing to make me miserable," she said, getting calmer; "but
can you unde

rstand that everything has become hateful, loathsome, coarse
to me, and i myself most of all? you canâ€™t imagine what loathsome
thoughts i have about everything."

"why, whatever loathsome thoughts can you have?" asked dolly, smiling.

"the most utterly loathsome and coarse: i canâ€™t tell you. itâ€™s not
unhappiness, or low spirits, but much worse. as though everything that
was good in me was all hidden away, and nothing was left but the most
loathsome. come, how am i to tell you?" she went on, seeing the puzzled
look in her sisterâ€™s eyes. "father began saying something to me just
now.... it seems to me he thinks all i want is to be married. mother

o be. her eyes were,
it seemed, opened; she felt all the difficulty of maintaining herself
without hypocrisy and self-conceit on the pinnacle to which she had
wished to mount. moreover, she became aware of all the dreariness of the
world of sorrow, of sick and dying people, in which she had been living.
the efforts she had made to like it seemed to her intolerable, and she
felt a longing to get back quickly into the fresh air, to russia, to
ergushovo, where, as she knew from letters, her sister dolly had already
gone with her children.

but her affection for varenka did not wane. as she said good-bye, kitty
begged her to come to them in russia.

"iâ€™ll come when you get married," said varenka.

"i shall never marry."

"well, then, i shall never come."

"well, then, i shall be married simply for that. mind now, remember your
promise," said kitty.

the doctorâ€™s prediction was fulfilled. kitty returned home to russia
cured. she was not so gay and thoughtless as before, but she was serene.

 met in the dining room. although it
seemed to levin that he was not hungry, and he sat down to dinner simply
so as not to hurt kouzmaâ€™s feelings, yet when he began to eat the dinner
struck him as extraordinarily good. sergey ivanovitch watched him with a
smile.

"oh, by the way, thereâ€™s a letter for you," said he. "kouzma, bring it
down, please. and mind you shut the doors."

the letter was from oblonsky. levin read it aloud. oblonsky wrote to him
from petersburg: "i have had a letter from dolly; sheâ€™s at ergushovo,
and everything seems going wrong there. do ride over and see her,
please; help her with advice; you know all about it. she will be so glad
to see you. sheâ€™s quite alone, poor thing. my mother-in-law and all of
them are still abroad."

"thatâ€™s capital! i will certainly ride over to her," said levin. "or
weâ€™ll go together. sheâ€™s such a splendid woman, isnâ€™t she?"

"theyâ€™re not far from here, then?"

chapter 7


stephan arkadyevitch had gone to petersburg to perform the most natural
and essential official dutyâ€”so familiar to everyone in the government
service, though incomprehensible to outsidersâ€”that duty, but for which
one could hardly be in government service, of reminding the ministry of
his existenceâ€”and having, for the due performance of this rite, taken
all the available cash from home, was gaily and agreeably spending his
days at the races and in the summer villas. meanwhile dolly and the
children had moved into the country, to cut down expenses as much as
possible. she had gone to ergushovo, the estate that had been her dowry,
and the one where in spring the forest had been sold. it was nearly
forty miles from levinâ€™s pokrovskoe. the big, old house at ergushovo had
been pulled down long ago, and the old prince had had the lodge done up
and built on to. twenty years before, when dolly was a child, the lodge
had been roomy and comfortable, though, like all lodges, it st

sideways to the entrance avenue, and faced the south. but by now this
lodge was old and dilapidated. when stepan arkadyevitch had gone down in
the spring to sell the forest, dolly had begged him to look over the
house and order what repairs might be needed. stepan arkadyevitch, like
all unfaithful husbands indeed, was very solicitous for his wifeâ€™s
comfort, and he had himself looked over the house, and given
instructions about everything that he considered necessary. what he
considered necessary was to cover all the furniture with cretonne, to
put up curtains, to weed the garden, to make a little bridge on the
pond, and to plant flowers. but he forgot many other essent

strength after the scarlatina, and also as a means of escaping the petty
humiliations, the little bills owing to the wood-merchant, the
fishmonger, the shoemaker, which made her miserable. besides this, she
was pleased to go away to the country because she was dreaming of
getting her sister kitty to stay with her there. kitty was to be back
from abroad in the middle of the summer, and bathing had been prescribed
for her. kitty wrote that no prospect was so alluring as to spend the
summer with dolly at ergushovo, full of childish associations for both
of them.

the first days of her existence in the country were very hard for dolly.
she used to stay in the country as a child, and the impression she had
retained of it was that the country was a refuge from all the
unpleasantness of the town, that life there, though not luxuriousâ€”dolly
could easily make up her mind to thatâ€”was cheap and comfortable; that
there was plenty of everything, everything was cheap, everything could
be got, and c

and she was at once aware that levin was aware of this. it was just for
this fineness of perception, for this delicacy, that darya alexandrovna
liked levin.

"i know, of course," said levin, "that that simply means that you would
like to see me, and iâ€™m exceedingly glad. though i can fancy that, used
to town housekeeping as you are, you must feel in the wilds here, and if
thereâ€™s anything wanted, iâ€™m altogether at your disposal."

"oh, no!" said dolly. "at first things were rather uncomfortable, but
now weâ€™ve settled everything capitallyâ€”thanks to my old nurse," she
said, indicating marya philimonovna, who, seeing that they were speaking
of her, smiled brightly and cordially to levin. she knew him, and knew
that he would be a good match for her young lady, and was very keen to
see the matter settled.

"wonâ€™t you get in, sir, weâ€™ll make room this side!" she said to him.

philimonovna had explained, was to give brindle and whitebreast more
food and drink, and not to let the cook carry all the kitchen slops to
the laundry maidâ€™s cow. that was clear. but general propositions as to
feeding on meal and on grass were doubtful and obscure. and, what was
most important, she wanted to talk about kitty.



chapter 10


"kitty writes to me that thereâ€™s nothing she longs for so much as quiet
and solitude," dolly said after the silence that had followed.

"and how is sheâ€”better?" levin asked in agitation.

"thank god, sheâ€™s quite well again. i never believed her lungs were
affected."

"oh, iâ€™m very glad!" said levin, and dolly fancied she saw something
touching, helpless, in his face as he said this and looked silently into
her face.

"let me ask you, konstantin dmitrievitch," said darya alexandrovna,
smiling her kindly and rather mocking smile, "why is it you are angry

 showed a gleam of white teeth and red lips, stood stepan
arkadyevitch, radiant, young, and beaming. he called him vigorously and
urgently, and insisted on his stopping. he had one arm on the window of
a carriage that was stopping at the corner, and out of the window were
thrust the heads of a lady in a velvet hat, and two children. stepan
arkadyevitch was smiling and beckoning to his brother-in-law. the lady
smiled a kindly smile too, and she too waved her hand to alexey
alexandrovitch. it was dolly with her children.

alexey alexandrovitch did not want to see anyone in moscow, and least of
all his wifeâ€™s brother. he raised his hat and would have driven on, but
stepan arkadyevitch told his coachman to stop, and ran across the snow
to him.

entered my head that it was you," said stepan arkadyevitch, sticking his
head in at the window of the

 glad to see you!" he said, knocking one foot against the other to
shake the snow off. "what a shame of you not to let us know!" he
repeated.

"i had no time; i am very busy," alexey alexandrovitch responded dryly.

"come to my wife, she does so want to see you."

alexey alexandrovitch unfolded the rug in which his frozen feet were
wrapped, and getting out of his carriage made his way over the snow to
darya alexandrovna.

"why, alexey alexandrovitch, what are you cutting us like this for?"
said dolly, smiling.

"i was very busy. delighted to see you!" he said in a tone clearly
indicating that he was annoyed by it. "how are you?"

"tell me, how is my darling anna?"

alexey alexandrovitch mumbled something and would have gone on. but
stepan arkadyevitch stopped him.

"i tell you what weâ€™ll do tomorrow. dolly, ask him to dinner. weâ€™ll ask
koznishev and pestsov, so as to entertain him with our moscow
celebrities."

"yes, please, do come," said dolly; "we will expect you at five, or six

"she is quite well," alexey alexandrovitch mumbled, frowning.
"delighted!" and he moved away towards his carriage.

"you will come?" dolly called after him.

alexey alexandrovitch said something which dolly could not catch in the
noise of the moving carriages.

"i shall come round tomorrow!" stepan arkadyevitch shouted to him.

alexey alexandrovitch got into his carriage, and buried himself in it so
as neither to see nor be seen.

"queer fish!" said stepan arkadyevitch to his wife, and glancing at his
watch, he made a motion of his hand before his face, indicating a caress
to his wife and children, and walked jauntily along the pavement.

"stiva! stiva!" dolly called, reddening.

he turned round.

vitch.
sergey ivanovitch was a moscow man, and a philosopher; alexey
alexandrovitch a petersburger, and a practical politician. he was
asking, too, the well-known eccentric enthusiast, pestsov, a liberal, a
great talker, a musician, an historian, and the most delightfully
youthful person of fifty, who would be a sauce or garnish for koznishev
and karenin. he would provoke them and set them off.

the second installment for the forest had been received from the
merchant and was not yet exhausted; dolly had been very amiable and
goodhumored of late, and the idea of the dinner pleased stepan
arkadyevitch from every point of view. he was in the most light-hearted
mood. there were two circumstances a little unpleasant, but these two
circumstances were drowned in the sea of good-humored gaiety which
flooded the soul of stepan arkadyevitch. these two circumstances were:
first, that on meeting alexey alexandrovitch the day before in the
street he had noticed that he was cold and reserved with him, a

rately determined step he walked into the drawing room
and beheld her.

she was not the same as she used to be, nor was she as she had been in
the carriage; she was quite different.

she was scared, shy, shame-faced, and still more charming from it. she
saw him the very instant he walked into the room. she had been expecting
him. she was delighted, and so confused at her own delight that there
was a moment, the moment when he went up to her sister and glanced again
at her, when she, and he, and dolly, who saw it all, thought she would
break down and would begin to cry. she crimsoned, turned white,
crimsoned again, and grew faint, waiting with quivering lips for him to
come to her. he went up to her, bowed, and held out his hand without
speaking. except for the slight quiver of her lips and the moisture in
her eyes that made them brighter, her smile was almost calm as she said:

"how long it is since weâ€™ve seen each other!" and with desperate
determination she pressed his hand with her col

e you think heâ€™s a horrid man?"

"not horrid, but nothing in him."

"oh, youâ€™re wrong! and you must give up thinking so directly!" said
kitty. "i used to have a very poor opinion of him too, but he, heâ€™s an
awfully nice and wonderfully good-hearted man. he has a heart of gold."

"how could you find out what sort of heart he has?"

"we are great friends. i know him very well. last winter, soon after ...
you came to see us," she said, with a guilty and at the same time
confiding smile, "all dollyâ€™s children had scarlet fever, and he
happened to come and see her. and only fancy," she said in a whisper,
"he felt so sorry for her that he stayed and began to help her look
after the children. yes, and for three weeks he stopped with them, and
looked after the children like a nurse."

"i am telling konstantin dmitrievitch about turovtsin in the scarlet
fever," she said, bending over to her sister.

"yes, it was wonderful, noble!" said dolly, glancing towards turovtsin,
who had become aware

on a sore place, so
stepan arkadyevitch felt now that the conversation would by ill luck
fall every moment on alexey alexandrovitchâ€™s sore spot. he would again
have got his brother-in-law away, but alexey alexandrovitch himself
inquired, with curiosity:

"what did pryatchnikov fight about?"

"his wife. acted like a man, he did! called him out and shot him!"

"ah!" said alexey alexandrovitch indifferently, and lifting his
eyebrows, he went into the drawing room.

"how glad i am you have come," dolly said with a frightened smile,
meeting him in the outer drawing room. "i must talk to you. letâ€™s sit
here."

alexey alexandrovitch, with the same expression of indifference, given
him by his lifted eyebrows, sat down beside darya alexandrovna, and
smiled affectedly.

"itâ€™s fortunate," said he, "especially as i was meaning to ask you to
excuse me, and to be taking leave. i have to start tomorrow."

darya alexandrovna was firmly convinced of annaâ€™s innocence, and she
felt herself growing pal

 her; i beg, i beseech you to tell me what is
wrong between you? what fault do you find with her?"

alexey alexandrovitch frowned, and almost closing his eyes, dropped his
head.

"i presume that your husband has told you the grounds on which i
consider it necessary to change my attitude to anna arkadyevna?" he
said, not looking her in the face, but eyeing with displeasure
shtcherbatsky, who was walking across the drawing room.

"i donâ€™t believe it, i donâ€™t believe it, i canâ€™t believe it!" dolly
said, clasping her bony hands before her with a vigorous gesture. she
rose quickly, and laid her hand on alexey alexandrovitchâ€™s sleeve. "we
shall be disturbed here. come this way, please."

dollyâ€™s agitation had an effect on alexey alexandrovitch. he got up and
submissively followed her to the schoolroom. they sat down to a table
covered with an oilcloth cut in slits by penknives.

"i donâ€™t, i donâ€™t believe it!" dolly said, trying to catch his glance
that avoided her.

"one cannot disb

elieve facts, darya alexandrovna," said he, with an
emphasis on the word "facts."

"but what has she done?" said darya alexandrovna. "what precisely has
she done?"

"she has forsaken her duty, and deceived her husband. thatâ€™s what she
has done," said he.

"no, no, it canâ€™t be! no, for godâ€™s sake, you are mistaken," said dolly,
putting her hands to her temples and closing her eyes.

alexey alexandrovitch smiled coldly, with his lips alone, meaning to
signify to her and to himself the firmness of his conviction; but this
warm defense, though it could not shake him, reopened his wound. he
began to speak with greater heat.

"it is extremely difficult to be mistaken when a wife herself informs
her husband of the factâ€”informs him that eight years of her life, and a
son, all thatâ€™s a mistake, and that she wants to begi

said angrily, with a snort.

"anna and sinâ€”i cannot connect them, i cannot believe it!"

"darya alexandrovna," he said, now looking straight into dollyâ€™s kindly,
troubled face, and feeling that his tongue was being loosened in spite
of himself, "i would give a great deal for doubt to be still possible.
when i doubted, i was miserable, but it was better than now. when i
doubted, i had hope; but now there is no hope, and still i doubt of
everything. i am in such doubt of everything that i even hate my son,
and sometimes do not believe he is my son. i am very unhappy."

he had no need to say that. darya alexandrovna had seen that as soon as

"nothing else to do, nothing else to do..." she replied, with tears in
her eyes. "oh no, donâ€™t say nothing else to do!" she said.

"what is horrible in a trouble of this kind is that one cannot, as in
any otherâ€”in loss, in deathâ€”bear oneâ€™s trouble in peace, but that one
must act," said he, as though guessing her thought. "one must get out of
the humiliating position in which one is placed; one canâ€™t live _Ã 
trois_."

"i understand, i quite understand that," said dolly, and her head sank.
she was silent for a little, thinking of herself, of her own grief in
her family, and all at once, with an impulsive movement, she raised her
head and clasped her hands with an imploring gesture. "but wait a
little! you are a christian. think of her! what will become of her, if
you cast her off?"

"i have thought, darya alexandrovna, i have thought a great deal," said
alexey alexandrovitch. his face turned red in patches, and his dim eyes
looked straight before him. darya al

epended on her understanding the words. she glanced at
him seriously, then leaned her puckered brow on her hands and began to
read. once or twice she stole a look at him, as though asking him, "is
it what i think?"

"i understand," she said, flushing a little.

"what is this word?" he said, pointing to the n that stood for _never_.

"it means _never_," she said; "but thatâ€™s not true!"

he quickly rubbed out what he had written, gave her the chalk, and stood
up. she wrote, _t, i, c, n, a, d_.

dolly was completely comforted in the depression caused by her
conversation with alexey alexandrovitch when she caught sight of the two
figures: kitty with the chalk in her hand, with a shy and happy smile
looking upwards at levin, and his handsome figure bending over the table
with glowing eyes fastened one minute on the table and the next on her.
he was suddenly radiant: he had understood. it meant, "then i could not
answer differently."

he glanced at her questioningly, timidly.

"only then?"

d fellow had said had not been at all so
stupid as he had fancied at first, and that there was something in it
that must be cleared up.

"of course, not now," thought levin, "but some day later on." levin felt
more than ever now that there was something not clear and not clean in
his soul, and that, in regard to religion, he was in the same position
which he perceived so clearly and disliked in others, and for which he
blamed his friend sviazhsky.

levin spent that evening with his betrothed at dollyâ€™s, and was in very
high spirits. to explain to stepan arkadyevitch the state of excitement
in which he found himself, he said that he was happy like a dog being
trained to jump through a hoop, who, having at last caught the idea, and
done what was required of him, whines and wags its tail, and jumps up to
the table and the windows in its delight.

tchirikov, when levin, after looking absently at him, had moved back to
his bride.

"kitty, mind youâ€™re the first to step on the carpet," said countess
nordston, coming up. "youâ€™re a nice person!" she said to levin.

"arenâ€™t you frightened, eh?" said marya dmitrievna, an old aunt.

"are you cold? youâ€™re pale. stop a minute, stoop down," said kittyâ€™s
sister, madame lvova, and with her plump, handsome arms she smilingly
set straight the flowers on her head.

dolly came up, tried to say something, but could not speak, cried, and
then laughed unnaturally.

kitty looked at all of them with the same absent eyes as levin.

meanwhile the officiating clergy had got into their vestments, and the
priest and deacon came out to the lectern, which stood in the forepart
of the church. the priest turned to levin saying something. levin did
not hear what the priest said.

"take the brideâ€™s hand and lead her up," the best man said to levin.

touchingly weak, pink little finger, the priest said the same thing.

and the bridal pair tried several times to understand what they had to
do, and each time made some mistake and were corrected by the priest in
a whisper. at last, having duly performed the ceremony, having signed
the rings with the cross, the priest handed kitty the big ring, and
levin the little one. again they were puzzled, and passed the rings from
hand to hand, still without doing what was expected.

dolly, tchirikov, and stepan arkadyevitch stepped forward to set them
right. there was an interval of hesitation, whispering, and smiles; but
the expression of solemn emotion on the faces of the betrothed pair did
not change: on the contrary, in their perplexity over their hands they
looked more grave and deeply moved than before, and the smile with which
stepan arkadyevitch whispered to them that now they would each put on
their own ring died away on his lips. he had a feeling that any smile

here was all moscow, all the friends and relations; and
during the ceremony of plighting troth, in the brilliantly lighted
church, there was an incessant flow of discreetly subdued talk in the
circle of gaily dressed women and girls, and men in white ties,
frockcoats, and uniforms. the talk was principally kept up by the men,
while the women were absorbed in watching every detail of the ceremony,
which always means so much to them.

in the little group nearest to the bride were her two sisters: dolly,
and the other one, the self-possessed beauty, madame lvova, who had just
arrived from abroad.

"why is it marieâ€™s in lilac, as bad as black, at a wedding?" said madame
korsunskaya.

"with her complexion, itâ€™s the one salvation," responded madame
trubetskaya. "i wonder why they had the wedding in the evening? itâ€™s
like shop-people..."

"so much prettier. i was married in the evening too..." answered madame
korsunskaya, and she sighed, remembering how charming she had been that
day, and ho

a. "and how well heâ€™s behaving! itâ€™s so difficult, too, to
look well in such a position, not to be ridiculous. and heâ€™s not
ridiculous, and not affected; one can see heâ€™s moved."

"you expected it, i suppose?"

"almost. she always cared for him."

"well, we shall see which of them will step on the rug first. i warned
kitty."

"it will make no difference," said madame lvova; "weâ€™re all obedient
wives; itâ€™s in our family."

"oh, i stepped on the rug before vassily on purpose. and you, dolly?"

dolly stood beside them; she heard them, but she did not answer. she was
deeply moved. the tears stood in her eyes, and she could not have spoken
without crying. she was rejoicing over kitty and levin; going back in
thought to her own wedding, she glanced at the radiant figure of stepan
arkadyevitch, forgot all the present, and remembered only her own
innocent love. she recalled not herself only, but all her women-friends
and acquaintances. she thought of them on the one day of their triumph

 think of something outside her love. this had
jarred upon him then, and now her trivial cares and anxieties jarred
upon him several times. but he saw that this was essential for her. and,
loving her as he did, though he did not understand the reason of them,
and jeered at these domestic pursuits, he could not help admiring them.
he jeered at the way in which she arranged the furniture they had
brought from moscow; rearranged their room; hung up curtains; prepared
rooms for visitors; a room for dolly; saw after an abode for her new
maid; ordered dinner of the old cook; came into collision with agafea
mihalovna, taking from her the charge of the stores. he saw how the old
cook smiled, admiring her, and listening to her inexperienced,
impossible orders, how mournfully and tenderly agafea mihalovna shook
her head over the young mistressâ€™s new arrangements. he saw that kitty
was extraordinarily sweet when, laughing and crying, she came to tell
him that her maid, masha, was used to looking upo

n her as her young
lady, and so no one obeyed her. it seemed to him sweet, but strange, and
he thought it would have been better without this.

he did not know how great a sense of change she was experiencing; she,
who at home had sometimes wanted some favorite dish, or sweets, without
the possibility of getting either, now could order what she liked, buy
pounds of sweets, spend as much money as she liked, and order any
puddings she pleased.

she was dreaming with delight now of dollyâ€™s coming to them with her
children, especially because she would order for the children their
favorite puddings and dolly would appreciate all her new housekeeping.
she did not know herself why and wherefore, but the arranging of her
house had an irresistible attraction for her. instinctively feeling the
approach of spring, and knowing that there would be days of rough
weather too, she built her nest as best she could, and was in haste at
the same time to build it and to learn how to do it.

 up children.
he knew not that she was instinctively aware of this, and preparing
herself for this time of terrible toil, did not reproach herself for the
moments of carelessness and happiness in her love that she enjoyed now
while gaily building her nest for the future.



chapter 16


when levin went upstairs, his wife was sitting near the new silver
samovar behind the new tea service, and, having settled old agafea
mihalovna at a little table with a full cup of tea, was reading a letter
from dolly, with whom they were in continual and frequent
correspondence.

"you see, your good ladyâ€™s settled me here, told me to sit a bit with
her," said agafea mihalovna, smiling affectionately at kitty.

in these words of agafea mihalovna, levin read the final act of the
drama which had been enacted of late between her and kitty. he saw that,
in spite of agafea mihalovnaâ€™s feelings being hurt by a new mistress
taking the reins of government out of her hands, kitty had yet conquered
her and made he

r love her.

"here, i opened your letter too," said kitty, handing him an illiterate
letter. "itâ€™s from that woman, i think, your brotherâ€™s..." she said. "i
did not read it through. this is from my people and from dolly. fancy!
dolly took tanya and grisha to a childrenâ€™s ball at the sarmatskysâ€™:
tanya was a french marquise."

but levin did not hear her. flushing, he took the letter from marya
nikolaevna, his brotherâ€™s former mistress, and began to read it. this
was the second letter he had received from marya nikolaevna. in the
first letter, marya nikolaevna wrote that his brother had sent her away
for no fault of hers, and, with touching simplicity, added that though
she was in want again, she asked for nothing, and

now she wrote quite differently.
she had found nikolay dmitrievitch, had again made it up with him in
moscow, and had moved with him to a provincial town, where he had
received a post in the government service. but that he had quarreled
with the head official, and was on his way back to moscow, only he had
been taken so ill on the road that it was doubtful if he would ever
leave his bed again, she wrote. "itâ€™s always of you he has talked, and,
besides, he has no more money left."

"read this; dolly writes about you," kitty was beginning, with a smile;
but she stopped suddenly, noticing the changed expression on her
husbandâ€™s face.

"what is it? whatâ€™s the matter?"

"she writes to me that nikolay, my brother, is at deathâ€™s door. i shall
go to him."

kittyâ€™s face changed at once. thoughts of tanya as a marquise, of dolly,
all had vanished.

"when are you going?" she said.

"tomorrow."

"and i will go with you, can i?" she said.

"kitty! what are you thinking of?" he said reproachful

long deserted, there were now so many people
that almost all the rooms were occupied, and almost every day it
happened that the old princess, sitting down to table, counted them all
over, and put the thirteenth grandson or granddaughter at a separate
table. and kitty, with her careful housekeeping, had no little trouble
to get all the chickens, turkeys, and geese, of which so many were
needed to satisfy the summer appetites of the visitors and children.

the whole family were sitting at dinner. dollyâ€™s children, with their
governess and varenka, were making plans for going to look for
mushrooms. sergey ivanovitch, who was looked up to by all the party for
his intellect and learning, with a respect that almost amounted to awe,
surprised everyone by joining in the conversation about mushrooms.

"take me with you. i am very fond of picking mushrooms," he said,
looking at varenka; "i think itâ€™s a very nice occupation."

"oh, we shall be delighted," answered varenka, coloring a little. kitty

exchanged meaningful glances with dolly. the proposal of the learned and
intellectual sergey ivanovitch to go looking for mushrooms with varenka
confirmed certain theories of kittyâ€™s with which her mind had been very
busy of late. she made haste to address some remark to her mother, so
that her look should not be noticed. after dinner sergey ivanovitch sat
with his cup of coffee at the drawing-room window, and while he took
part in a conversation he had begun with his brother, he watched the
door through which the children would st

am-making, tried to appear to be
absorbed in other things and not interested in the jam, talked of other
matters, but cast stealthy glances in the direction of the stove.

"i always buy my maidsâ€™ dresses myself, of some cheap material," the
princess said, continuing the previous conversation. "isnâ€™t it time to
skim it, my dear?" she added, addressing agafea mihalovna. "thereâ€™s not
the slightest need for you to do it, and itâ€™s hot for you," she said,
stopping kitty.

"iâ€™ll do it," said dolly, and getting up, she carefully passed the spoon
over the frothing sugar, and from time to time shook off the clinging
jam from the spoon by knocking it on a plate that was covered with
yellow-red scum and blood-colored syrup. "how theyâ€™ll enjoy this at
tea-time!" she thought of her children, remembering how she herself as a
child had wondered how it was the grown-up people did not eat what was
best of allâ€”the scum of the jam.

"stiva says itâ€™s much better to give money." dolly took up mea

 "but..."

"moneyâ€™s out of the question!" the princess and kitty exclaimed with one
voice. "they appreciate a present..."

"well, last year, for instance, i bought our matrona semyenovna, not a
poplin, but something of that sort," said the princess.

"i remember she was wearing it on your nameday."

"a charming patternâ€”so simple and refined,â€”i should have liked it
myself, if she hadnâ€™t had it. something like varenkaâ€™s. so pretty and
inexpensive."

"well, now i think itâ€™s done," said dolly, dropping the syrup from the
spoon.

"when it sets as it drops, itâ€™s ready. cook it a little longer, agafea
mihalovna."

"the flies!" said agafea mihalovna angrily. "itâ€™ll be just the same,"
she added.

"ah! how sweet it is! donâ€™t frighten it!" kitty said suddenly, looking
at a sparrow that had settled on the step and was pecking at the center
of a raspberry.

"yes, but you keep a little further from the stove," said her mother.

"_Ã  propos de varenka_," said kitty, speaking in french, a

been doing all the while, so that agafea mihalovna should not understand
them, "you know, mamma, i somehow expect things to be settled today. you
know what i mean. how splendid it would be!"

"but what a famous matchmaker she is!" said dolly. "how carefully and
cleverly she throws them together!..."

"no; tell me, mamma, what do you think?"

"why, what is one to think? he" (_he_ meant sergey ivanovitch) "might at
any time have been a match for anyone in russia; now, of course, heâ€™s
not quite a young man, still i know ever so many girls would be glad to
marry him even now.... sheâ€™s a very nice girl, but he might..."

"oh, no, mamma, do understand why, for him and for her too, nothing
better could be imagined. in the first place,

 sheâ€™s charming!" said
kitty, crooking one of her fingers.

"he thinks her very attractive, thatâ€™s certain," assented dolly.

"then he occupies such a position in society that he has no need to look
for either fortune or position in his wife. all he needs is a good,
sweet wifeâ€”a restful one."

"well, with her he would certainly be restful," dolly assented.

"thirdly, that she should love him. and so it is ... that is, it would
be so splendid!... i look forward to seeing them coming out of the
forestâ€”and everything settled. i shall see at once by their eyes. i
should be so delighted! what do you think, dolly?"

"but donâ€™t excite yourself. itâ€™s not at all the thing for you to be
excited," said her mother.

"oh, iâ€™m not excited, mamma. i fancy he will make her an offer today."

"ah, thatâ€™s so strange, how and when a man makes an

offer!... there is a
sort of barrier, and all at once itâ€™s broken down," said dolly, smiling
pensively and recalling her past with stepan arkadyevitch.

"mamma, how did papa make you an offer?" kitty asked suddenly.

"there was nothing out of the way, it was very simple," answered the
princess, but her face beamed all over at the recollection.

"oh, but how was it? you loved him, anyway, before you were allowed to
speak?"

kitty felt a peculiar pleasure in being able now to talk to her mother
on equal terms about those questions of such paramount interest in a
womanâ€™s life.

 
 ___________________________
 

"of course i did; he had come to stay with us in the country."

"but how was it settled between you, mamma?"

"you imagine, i dare say, that you invented something quite new? itâ€™s
always just the same: it was settled by the eyes, by smiles..."

"how nicely you said that, mamma! itâ€™s just by the eyes, by smiles that
itâ€™s done," dolly assented.

"but what words did he say?"

"what did kostya say to you?"

"he wrote it in chalk. it was wonderful.... how long ago it seems!" she
said.

and the three women all fell to musing on the same thing. kitty was the
first to break the silence. she remembered all that last winter before
her marriage, and her passion for vronsky.

"thereâ€™s one thing ... that old love affair of varenkaâ€™s," she said, a
natural chain of ideas bringing her to this point. "i should have liked
to say somethi

ng to sergey ivanovitch, to prepare him. theyâ€™re allâ€”all
men, i mean," she added, "awfully jealous over our past."

"not all," said dolly. "you judge by your own husband. it makes him
miserable even now to remember vronsky. eh? thatâ€™s true, isnâ€™t it?"

"yes," kitty answered, a pensive smile in her eyes.

"but i really donâ€™t know," the mother put in in defense of her motherly
care of her daughter, "what there was in your past that could worry him?
that vronsky paid you attentionsâ€”that happens to every girl."

"oh, yes, but we didnâ€™t mean that," kitty said, flushing a little.

"no, let me speak," her mother went on, "why,
 
 ___________________________
 
ourself would not let
me have a talk to vronsky. donâ€™t you remember?"

"oh, mamma!" said kitty, with an expression of suffering.

"thereâ€™s no keeping you young people in check nowadays.... your
friendship could not have gone beyond what was suitable. i should myself
have called upon him to explain himself. but, my darling, itâ€™s not right
for you to be agitated. please remember that, and calm yourself."

"iâ€™m perfectly calm, maman."

"how happy it was for kitty that anna came then," said dolly, "and how
unhappy for her. it turned out quite the opposite," she said, struck by
her own ideas. "then anna was so happy, and kitty thought herself
unhappy. now it is just the opposite. i often think of her."

"a nice person to think about! horrid, repulsive womanâ€”no heart," said
her mother, who could not forget that kitty had married not vronsky, but
levin.

"what do you want to talk of it for?" kitty said with annoyance. "i
never think about it, and i donâ€™t want to think of it.... and i d

know that happy as the princess was in her daughterâ€™s house, and useful
as she felt herself to be there, she had been extremely miserable, both
on her own account and her husbandâ€™s, ever since they had married their
last and favorite daughter, and the old home had been left empty.

"what is it, agafea mihalovna?" kitty asked suddenly of agafea
mihalovna, who was standing with a mysterious air, and a face full of
meaning.

"about supper."

"well, thatâ€™s right," said dolly; "you go and arrange about it, and iâ€™ll
go and hear grisha repeat his lesson, or else he will have nothing done
all day."

"thatâ€™s my lesson! no, dolly, iâ€™m going," said levin, jumping up.

grisha, who was by now at a high school, had to go over the lessons of
the term in the summer holidays. darya alexandrovna, who had been
studying latin with her son in moscow before, had made it a rule on
coming to the levinsâ€™ to go over with him, at least once a day, the most
difficult lessons of la

ake it again herself.
levin was amazed both at stepan arkadyevitch, who, by neglecting his
duty, threw upon the mother the supervision of studies of which she had
no comprehension, and at the teachers for teaching the children so
badly. but he promised his sister-in-law to give the lessons exactly as
she wished. and he went on teaching grisha, not in his own way, but by
the book, and so took little interest in it, and often forgot the hour
of the lesson. so it had been today.

"no, iâ€™m going, dolly, you sit still," he said. "weâ€™ll do it all
properly, like the book. only when stiva comes, and we go out shooting,
then we shall have to miss it."

and levin went to grisha.

varenka was saying the same thing to kitty. even in the happy,
well-ordered household of the levins varenka had succeeded in making
herself useful.

"iâ€™ll see to the supper, you sit still," she said, and got up to go to
agafea mihalovna.

"yes, yes, most likely theyâ€™ve not been able to get chickens. if so,
ours..."

out of the question for her" (she indicated kitty) "to stay here; that
she positively must come to moscow. he talks of getting a doctor
down..."

"maman, heâ€™ll do everything; he has agreed to everything," kitty said,
angry with her mother for appealing to sergey ivanovitch to judge in
such a matter.

in the middle of their conversation they heard the snorting of horses
and the sound of wheels on the gravel. dolly had not time to get up to
go and meet her husband, when from the window of the room below, where
grisha was having his lesson, levin leaped out and helped grisha out
after him.

"itâ€™s stiva!" levin shouted from under the balcony. "weâ€™ve finished,
dolly, donâ€™t be afraid!" he added, and started running like a boy to
meet the carriage.

"_is ea id, ejus, ejus, ejus!_" shouted grisha, skipping along the
avenue.

"and some one else too! papa, of course!" cried levin, stopping at the
entrance o

veslovsky, once more shaking levinâ€™s hand with great warmth.

"well, are there plenty of birds?" stepan arkadyevitch said to levin,
hardly leaving time for everyone to utter their greetings. "weâ€™ve come
with the most savage intentions. why, maman, theyâ€™ve not been in moscow
since! look, tanya, hereâ€™s something for you! get it, please, itâ€™s in
the carriage, behind!" he talked in all directions. "how pretty youâ€™ve
grown, dolly," he said to his wife, once more kissing her hand, holding
it in one of his, and patting it with the other.

levin, who a minute before had been in the happiest frame of mind, now
looked darkly at everyone, and everything displeased him.

"who was it he kissed yesterday with those lips?" he thought, looking at
stepan arkadyevitchâ€™s tender demonstrations to his wife. he looked at
dolly, and he did not like her either.

"she doesnâ€™t believe in his love. so what is she so pleased about?

that was so out of keeping with him. "i canâ€™t answer for our finding

youâ€™re not tired? arenâ€™t you tired, stiva?"

"me tired? iâ€™ve never been tired yet. suppose we stay up all night.
letâ€™s go for a walk!"

"yes, really, letâ€™s not go to bed at all! capital!" veslovsky chimed in.

"oh, we all know you can do without sleep, and keep other people up
too," dolly said to her husband, with that faint note of irony in her
voice which she almost always had now with her husband. "but to my
thinking, itâ€™s time for bed now.... iâ€™m going, i donâ€™t want supper."

"no, do stay a little, dolly," said stepan arkadyevitch, going round to
her side behind the table where they were having supper. "iâ€™ve so much
still to tell you."

"nothing really, i suppose."

"do you know veslovsky has been at annaâ€™s, and heâ€™s going to them again?

vassenka crossed over to the ladies, and sat down beside kitty.

"ah, do tell me, please; you have stayed with her? how was she?" darya
alexandrovna appealed to him.

levin was left at the other end of the table, and though never pausing
in his conversation with the princess and varenka, he saw that there was
an eager and mysterious conversation going on between stepan
arkadyevitch, dolly, kitty, and veslovsky. and that was not all. he saw
on his wifeâ€™s face an expression of real feeling as she gazed with fixed
eyes on the handsome face of vassenka, who was telling them something
with great animation.

"itâ€™s exceedingly nice at their place," veslovsky was telling them about
vronsky and anna. "i canâ€™t, of course, take it upon myself to judge, but
in their house you feel the real feeling of home."

"what do they intend doing?"

"i believe they think of going to moscow."

"ho

w jolly it would be for us all to go over to them together! when are
you going there?" stepan arkadyevitch asked vassenka.

"iâ€™m spending july there."

"will you go?" stepan arkadyevitch said to his wife.

"iâ€™ve been wanting to a long while; i shall certainly go," said dolly.
"i am sorry for her, and i know her. sheâ€™s a splendid woman. i will go
alone, when you go back, and then i shall be in no oneâ€™s way. and it
will be better indeed without you."

"to be sure," said stepan arkadyevitch. "and you, kitty?"

"i? why should i go?" kitty said, flushing all over, and she glanced
round at her husband.

"do you know anna arkadyevna, then?" veslovsky asked her. "sheâ€™s a very
fascinating woman."

"yes," she answered veslovsky, crimsoning still more. she got up and

strange as it was to him afterwards to recall it, it seemed to him at
the moment clear that in asking whether he was going shooting, all she
cared to know was whether he would give that pleasure to vassenka
veslovsky, with whom, as he fancied, she was in love.

"yes, iâ€™m going," he answered her in an unnatural voice, disagreeable to
himself.

"no, better spend the day here tomorrow, or dolly wonâ€™t see anything of
her husband, and set off the day after," said kitty.

the motive of kittyâ€™s words was interpreted by levin thus: "donâ€™t
separate me from _him_. i donâ€™t care about _your_ going, but do let me
enjoy the society of this delightful young man."

"oh, if you wish, weâ€™ll stay here tomorrow," levin answered, with
peculiar amiability.

vassenka meanwhile, utterly unsuspecting the misery his presence had
occasioned, got up from the table after kitty, and watching her with

ms for them. just as levin had disliked all the trivial
preparations for his wedding, as derogatory to the grandeur of the
event, now he felt still more offensive the preparations for the
approaching birth, the date of which they reckoned, it seemed, on their
fingers. he tried to turn a deaf ear to these discussions of the best
patterns of long clothes for the coming baby; tried to turn away and
avoid seeing the mysterious, endless strips of knitting, the triangles
of linen, and so on, to which dolly attached special importance. the
birth of a son (he was certain it would be a son) which was promised
him, but which he still could not believe inâ€”so marvelous it
seemedâ€”presented itself to his mind, on one hand, as a happiness so
immense, and therefore so incredible; on the other, as an event so
mysterious, that this assumption of a definite knowledge of what would
be, and consequent preparation for it, as for something ordinary that
did happen to people, jarred on him as confusing and hum

ut the slightest transition, he felt cast down from a
pinnacle of happiness, peace, and dignity, into an abyss of despair,
rage, and humiliation. again everything and everyone had become hateful
to him.

"you do just as you think best, princess," he said again, looking round.

"heavy is the cap of monomach," stepan arkadyevitch said playfully,
hinting, evidently, not simply at the princessâ€™s conversation, but at
the cause of levinâ€™s agitation, which he had noticed.

"how late you are today, dolly!"

everyone got up to greet darya alexandrovna. vassenka only rose for an
instant, and with the lack of courtesy to ladies characteristic of the
modern young man, he scarcely bowed, and resumed his conversation again,
laughing at something.

"iâ€™ve been worried about masha. she did not sleep well, and is
dreadfully tiresome today," said dolly.

the conversation vassenka had started with kitty was running on the same
lines as on the previous evening, discussing anna, and whether love is
to be p

d both by the subject and the tone in
which it was conducted, and also by the knowledge of the effect it would
have on her husband. but she was too simple and innocent to know how to
cut short this conversation, or even to conceal the superficial pleasure
afforded her by the young manâ€™s very obvious admiration. she wanted to
stop it, but she did not know what to do. whatever she did she knew
would be observed by her husband, and the worst interpretation put on
it. and, in fact, when she asked dolly what was wrong with masha, and
vassenka, waiting till this uninteresting conversation was over, began
to gaze indifferently at dolly, the question struck levin as an
unnatural and disgusting piece of hypocrisy.

"what do you say, shall we go and look for mushrooms today?" said dolly.

"by all means, please, and i shall come too," said kitty, and she
blushed. she wanted from politeness to ask vassenka whether he would
come, and she did not ask him. "where are you going, kostya?" she asked

people.... why did he come? how happy we were!" she said, breathless
with the sobs that shook her.

although nothing had been pursuing them, and there was nothing to run
away from, and they could not possibly have found anything very
delightful on that garden seat, the gardener saw with astonishment that
they passed him on their way home with comforted and radiant faces.



chapter 15


after escorting his wife upstairs, levin went to dollyâ€™s part of the
house. darya alexandrovna, for her part, was in great distress too that
day. she was walking about the room, talking angrily to a little girl,
who stood in the corner roaring.

"and you shall stand all day in the corner, and have your dinner all
alone, and not see one of your dolls, and i wonâ€™t make you a new frock,"
she said, not knowing how to punish her.

"oh, she is a disgusting child!" she turned to levin. "where does she
get such wicked propensities?"

"why, what has she

unlucky moment.

"grisha and she went into the raspberries, and there ... i canâ€™t tell
you really what she did. itâ€™s a thousand pities miss elliotâ€™s not with
us. this one sees to nothingâ€”sheâ€™s a machine.... _figurez-vous que la
petite_?..."

and darya alexandrovna described mashaâ€™s crime.

"that proves nothing; itâ€™s not a question of evil propensities at all,
itâ€™s simply mischief," levin assured her.

"but you are upset about something? what have you come for?" asked
dolly. "whatâ€™s going on there?"

and in the tone of her question levin heard that it would be easy for
him to say what he had meant to say.

"iâ€™ve not been in there, iâ€™ve been alone in the garden with kitty. weâ€™ve
had a quarrel for the second time since ... stiva came."

dolly looked at him with her shrewd, comprehending eyes.

"come, tell me, honor bright, has there been ... not in kitty, but in
that gentlemanâ€™s behavior, a tone which might be unpleasantâ€”not
unpleasant, but horrible, off

e that he is behaving as
young men do behave. _il fait la cour Ã  une jeune et jolie femme_, and a
husband whoâ€™s a man of the world should only be flattered by it."

"yes, yes," said levin gloomily; "but you noticed it?"

"not only i, but stiva noticed it. just after breakfast he said to me in
so many words, _je crois que veslovsky fait un petit brin de cour Ã 
kitty_."

"well, thatâ€™s all right then; now iâ€™m satisfied. iâ€™ll send him away,"
said levin.

"what do you mean! are you crazy?" dolly cried in horror; "nonsense,
kostya, only think!" she said, laughing. "you can go now to fanny," she
said to masha. "no, if you wish it, iâ€™ll speak to stiva. heâ€™ll take him
away. he can say youâ€™re expecting visitors. altogether he doesnâ€™t fit
into the house."

"no, no, iâ€™ll do it myself."

"but youâ€™ll quarrel with him?"

"not a bit. i shall so enjoy it," levin said, his eyes flashing with
real enjoyment. "come, forgive her, dolly, she wonâ€™t do it again," he
said of the little sinne

irresolutely before her mother, waiting and looking up from under her
brows to catch her motherâ€™s eye.

the mother glanced at her. the child broke into sobs, hid her face on
her motherâ€™s lap, and dolly laid her thin, tender hand on her head.

"and what is there in common between us and him?" thought levin, and he
went off to look for veslovsky.

as he passed through the passage he gave orders for the carriage to be
got ready to drive to the station.

"the spring was broken yesterday," said the footman.

"well, the covered trap, then, and make haste. whereâ€™s the visitor?"

"the gentlemanâ€™s gone to his room."

levin came upon veslovsky at the moment when the latter, having unpacked
his thin

 when he asked himself how he should act another
time, he answered that he should do just the same again.

in spite of all this, towards the end of that day, everyone except the
princess, who could not pardon levinâ€™s action, became extraordinarily
lively and good humored, like children after a punishment or grown-up
people after a dreary, ceremonious reception, so that by the evening
vassenkaâ€™s dismissal was spoken of, in the absence of the princess, as
though it were some remote event. and dolly, who had inherited her
fatherâ€™s gift of humorous storytelling, made varenka helpless with
laughter as she related for the third and fourth time, always with fresh
humorous additions, how she had only just put on her new shoes for the
benefit of the visitor, and on going into the drawing room, heard
suddenly the rumble of the trap. and who should be in the trap but
vassenka himself, with his scotch cap, and his songs and his gaiters,
and all, sitting in the hay.

viazhsky in the _char-Ã -banc_. they had gone out
to look at the working of a new reaping machine.

when the carriage stopped, the party on horseback were coming at a
walking pace. anna was in front beside veslovsky. anna, quietly walking
her horse, a sturdy english cob with cropped mane and short tail, her
beautiful head with her black hair straying loose under her high hat,
her full shoulders, her slender waist in her black riding habit, and all
the ease and grace of her deportment, impressed dolly.

for the first minute it seemed to her unsuitable for anna to be on
horseback. the conception of riding on horseback for a lady was, in
darya alexandrovnaâ€™s mind, associated with ideas of youthful flirtation
and frivolity, which, in her opinion, was unbecoming in annaâ€™s position.
but when she had scrutinized her, seeing her closer, she was at once
reconciled to her riding. in spite of her elegance, everything was so
simple, quiet, and dignified in the attitude, the dress and the

rode vronsky on a dark bay mare, obviously heated from galloping. he was
holding her in, pulling at the reins.

after him rode a little man in the dress of a jockey. sviazhsky and
princess varvara in a new _char-Ã -banc_ with a big, raven-black trotting
horse, overtook the party on horseback.

annaâ€™s face suddenly beamed with a joyful smile at the instant when, in
the little figure huddled in a corner of the old carriage, she
recognized dolly. she uttered a cry, started in the saddle, and set her
horse into a gallop. on reaching the carriage she jumped off without
assistance, and holding up her riding habit, she ran up to greet dolly.

"i thought it was you and dared not think it. how delightful! you canâ€™t
fancy how glad i am!" she said, at one moment pressing her face against
dolly and kissing her, and at the next holding her off and examining her
with a smile.

"hereâ€™s a delightful surprise, alexey!" she said, looking round at

vronsky, who had dismounted, and was walking towards them.

vronsky, taking off his tall gray hat, went up to dolly.

"you wouldnâ€™t believe how glad we are to see you," he said, giving
peculiar significance to the words, and showing his strong white teeth
in a smile.

vassenka veslovsky, without getting off his horse, took off his cap and
greeted the visitor by gleefully waving the ribbons over his head.

"thatâ€™s princess varvara," anna said in reply to a glance of inquiry
from dolly as the _char-Ã -banc_ drove up.

"ah!" said darya alexandrovna, and unconsciously her face betrayed her
dissatisfaction.

princess varvara was her husbandâ€™s aunt, and she had long known her, and
did not respect her. she knew that princess varvara had passed her whole
life toadying on her rich relations, but that she should now be sponging
on vronsky, a man who was nothing to her, mortified dolly on account of
her kinship with her husband. anna noticed dollyâ€™s expression, and was

to the _char-Ã -banc_ and coldly greeted
princess varvara. sviazhsky too she knew. he inquired how his queer
friend with the young wife was, and running his eyes over the
ill-matched horses and the carriage with its patched mud-guards,
proposed to the ladies that they should get into the _char-Ã -banc_.

"and iâ€™ll get into this vehicle," he said. "the horse is quiet, and the
princess drives capitally."

"no, stay as you were," said anna, coming up, "and weâ€™ll go in the
carriage," and taking dollyâ€™s arm, she drew her away.

darya alexandrovnaâ€™s eyes were fairly dazzled by the elegant carriage of
a pattern she had never seen before, the splendid horses, and the
elegant and gorgeous people surrounding her. but what struck her most of
all was the change that had taken place in anna, whom she knew so well
and loved. any other woman, a less close observer, not knowing anna
before, or not having thought as darya alexandrovna had been thinking on
the road, would not have noticed anything sp

ecial in anna. but now dolly
was struck by that temporary beauty, which is only found in women during
the moments of love, and which she saw now in annaâ€™s face. everything in
her face, the clearly marked dimples in her cheeks and chin, the line of
her lips, the smile which, as it were, fluttered about her face, the
brilliance of her eyes, the grace and rapidity of her movements, the
fulness of the notes of her voice, even the manner in which, with a sort
of angry friendliness, she answered veslovsky when he asked permiss

to get on her cob, so as to teach it to gallop with the right leg
foremostâ€”it was all peculiarly fascinating, and it seemed as if she were
herself aware of it, and rejoicing in it.

when both the women were seated in the carriage, a sudden embarrassment
came over both of them. anna was disconcerted by the intent look of
inquiry dolly fixed upon her. dolly was embarrassed because after
sviazhskyâ€™s phrase about "this vehicle," she could not help feeling
ashamed of the dirty old carriage in which anna was sitting with her.
the coachman philip and the counting house clerk were experiencing the
same sensation. the counting house clerk, to conceal his confusion,
busied himself settling the ladies, but philip the coachman became
sullen, and was bracing himself not to be overawed in future by this
external superiority. he smiled ironically, looking at

"look-ee! is that a woman in breeches?" said one of them, pointing to
vassenka veslovsky sitting in a side saddle.

"nay, a man! see how smartly heâ€™s going it!"

"eh, lads! seems weâ€™re not going to sleep, then?"

"what chance of sleep today!" said the old man, with a sidelong look at
the sun. "middayâ€™s past, look-ee! get your hooks, and come along!"



chapter 18


anna looked at dollyâ€™s thin, care-worn face, with its wrinkles filled
with dust from the road, and she was on the point of saying what she was
thinking, that is, that dolly had got thinner. but, conscious that she
herself had grown handsomer, and that dollyâ€™s eyes were telling her so,
she sighed and began to speak about herself.

"you are looking at me," she said, "and wondering how i can be happy in
my position? well! itâ€™s shameful to confess, but i ... iâ€™m inexcusably
happy. something magical has happened

the dread, and now for a long while past, especially since weâ€™ve been
here, iâ€™ve been so happy!..." she said, with a timid smile of inquiry
looking at dolly.

"how glad i am!" said dolly smiling, involuntarily speaking more coldly
than she wanted to. "iâ€™m very glad for you. why havenâ€™t you written to
me?"

"why?... because i hadnâ€™t the courage.... you forget my position..."

"to me? hadnâ€™t the courage? if you knew how i ... i look at..."

darya alexandrovna wanted to express her thoughts of the morning, but
for some reason it seemed to her now out of place to do so.

"but of that weâ€™ll talk later. whatâ€™s this, what are all these
buildings?" she asked, wanting to cha

anna did not even glance at him; but again it seemed to darya
alexandrovna out of place to enter upon such a long conversation in the
carriage, and so she cut short her thought.

"i donâ€™t think anything," she said, "but i always loved you, and if one
loves anyone, one loves the whole person, just as they are and not as
one would like them to be...."

anna, taking her eyes off her friendâ€™s face and dropping her eyelids
(this was a new habit dolly had not seen in her before), pondered,
trying to penetrate the full significance of the words. and obviously
interpreting them as she would have wished, she glanced at dolly.

"if you had any sins," she said, "they would all be forgiven you for
your coming to see me and these words."

and dolly saw that tears stood in her eyes. she pressed annaâ€™s hand in
silence.

"well, what are these buildings? how many there are of them!" after a
momentâ€™s silence she repeated her question.

"these are th

youâ€™ll see the house in a moment. it was his grandfatherâ€™s house, and he
has had nothing changed outside."

"how beautiful!" said dolly, looking with involuntary admiration at the
handsome house with columns, standing out among the different-colored
greens of the old trees in the garden.

"isnâ€™t it fine? and from the house, from the top, the view is
wonderful."

they drove into a courtyard strewn with gravel and bright with flowers,
in which two laborers were at work putting an edging of stones round the
light mould of a flower bed, and drew up in a covered entry.

"ah, theyâ€™re here already!" said anna, looking at the saddl

horse the sugar the footman had brought her.

"_et vous oubliez votre devoir_," she said to veslovsky, who came out
too on the steps.

"_pardon, jâ€™en ai tout plein les poches_," he answered, smiling, putting
his fingers in his waistcoat pocket.

"_mais vous venez trop tard_," she said, rubbing her handkerchief on her
hand, which the horse had made wet in taking the sugar.

anna turned to dolly. "you can stay some time? for one day only? thatâ€™s
impossible!"

"i promised to be back, and the children..." said dolly, feeling
embarrassed both because she had to get her bag out of the carriage, and
because she knew her face must be covered with dust.

"no, dolly, darling!... well, weâ€™ll see. come along, come along!" and
anna led dolly to her room.

that room was not the smart guest chamber vronsky had suggested, but the
one of which anna had said that dolly would excuse it. and this ro

for which excuse was needed, was more full of luxury than any in which
dolly had ever stayed, a luxury that reminded her of the best hotels

"well, darling, how happy i am!" anna said, sitting down in her riding
habit for a moment beside dolly. "tell me about all of you. stiva i had
only a glimpse of, and he cannot tell one about the children. how is my
favorite, tanya? quite a big girl, i expect?"

"yes, sheâ€™s very tall," darya alexandrovna answered shortly, surprised
herself that she should respond so coolly about her children. "we are
having a delightful stay at the levinsâ€™," she added.

a special sort of bolster and silk pillowcases on the little pillows.
the marble washstand, the dressing table, the little sofa, the tables,
the bronze clock on the chimney piece, the window curtains, and the

the smart maid, who came in to offer her services, with her hair done up
high, and a gown more fashionable than dollyâ€™s, was as new and expensive
as the whole room. darya alexandrovna liked her neatness, her
deferential and obliging manners, but she felt ill at ease with her. she
felt ashamed of her seeing the patched dressing jacket that had
unluckily been packed by mistake for her. she was ashamed of the very

had known for years, walked in. the smart maid was sent for to go to her
mistress, and annushka remained with darya alexandrovna.

annushka was obviously much pleased at that ladyâ€™s arrival, and began to
chatter away without a pause. dolly observed that she was longing to
express her opinion in regard to her mistressâ€™s position, especially as
to the love and devotion of the count to anna arkadyevna, but dolly
carefully interrupted her whenever she began to speak about this.

"i grew up with anna arkadyevna; my ladyâ€™s dearer to me than anything.
well, itâ€™s not for us to judge. and, to be sure, there seems so much
love..."

"kindly pour out the water for me to wash now, please," darya
alexandrovna cut her short.

"certainly.

weâ€™ve two women kept specially for washing small things, but
most of the linenâ€™s done by machinery. the count goes into everything
himself. ah, what a husband!..."

dolly was glad when anna came in, and by her entrance put a stop to
annushkaâ€™s gossip.

anna had put on a very simple batiste gown. dolly scrutinized that
simple gown attentively. she knew what it meant, and the price at which
such simplicity was obtained.

"an old friend," said anna of annushka.

anna was not embarrassed now. she was perfectly composed and at ease.
dolly saw that she had now completely recovered from the impression her
arrival had made on her, and had assumed that superficial, careless tone
which, as it were, closed the door on that compartment in which her
deeper feelings and ideas were kept.

"well, anna, and

how is your little girl?" asked dolly.

"annie?" (this was what she called her little daughter anna.) "very
well. she has got on wonderfully. would you like to see her? come, iâ€™ll
show her to you. we had a terrible bother," she began telling her, "over
nurses. we had an italian wet-nurse. a good creature, but so stupid! we
wanted to get rid of her, but the baby is so used to her that weâ€™ve gone
on keeping her still."

"but how have you managed?..." dolly was beginning a question as to what
name the little girl would have; but noticing a sudden frown on annaâ€™s
face, she changed the drift of her question.

"how did you manage? have you weaned her yet?"

but anna had understood.

"you didnâ€™t mean to ask that? you meant to ask about her surname. yes?
that worries alexey. she has no nameâ€”that is, sheâ€™s a karenina," said
anna, dropping her eyelids till nothing could be seen but the eyelashes
meeting. "but weâ€™ll talk about all that later," h

in the nursery the luxury which had impressed dolly in the whole house
struck her still more. there were little go-carts ordered from england,
and appliances for learning to walk, and a sofa after the fashion of a
billiard table, purposely constructed for crawling, and swings and
baths, all of special pattern, and modern. they were all english, solid,
and of good make, and obviously very expensive. the room was large, and
very light and lofty.

when they went in, the baby, with nothing on but her little smock, was
sitting in a little elbow chair

have to have the house lively and gay, so that alexey may not long for

and he understands his work. alexey has a very high opinion of him. then
the doctor, a young man, not quite a nihilist perhaps, but you know,
eats with his knife ... but a very good doctor. then the architect....
_une petite cour!_"



chapter 20


"hereâ€™s dolly for you, princess, you were so anxious to see her," said
anna, coming out with darya alexandrovna onto the stone terrace where
princess varvara was sitting in the shade at an embroidery frame,
working at a cover for count alexey kirillovitchâ€™s easy chair. "she says
she doesnâ€™t want anything before dinner, but please order some lunch for
her, and iâ€™ll go and look for alexey and bring them all in."

princess varvara gave dolly a cordial and rather patronizing reception,
and began at once ex

thods of spending the next two hours were
proposed. there were very many methods of passing the time at
vozdvizhenskoe, and these were all unlike those in use at pokrovskoe.

"_une partie de lawn-tennis,_" veslovsky proposed, with his handsome
smile. "weâ€™ll be partners again, anna arkadyevna."

"no, itâ€™s too hot; better stroll about the garden and have a row in the
boat, show darya alexandrovna the river banks." vronsky proposed.

"i agree to anything," said sviazhsky.

"i imagine that what dolly would like best would be a strollâ€”wouldnâ€™t
you? and then the boat, perhaps," said anna.

so it was decided. veslovsky and tushkevitch went off to the bathing
place, promising to get the boat ready and to wait there for them.

they walked along the path in two couples, anna with sviazhsky, and
dolly with vronsky. dolly was a little embarrassed and anxious in the
new surroundings in which she found herself. abstractly, theoretically,
she did not merely justify, she positively approved of anna

f unimpeachable virtue, weary of
the monotony of respectable existence, at a distance she not only
excused illicit love, she positively envied it. besides, she loved anna
with all her heart. but seeing anna in actual life among these
strangers, with this fashionable tone that was so new to darya
alexandrovna, she felt ill at ease. what she disliked particularly was
seeing princess varvara ready to overlook everything for the sake of the
comforts she enjoyed.

as a general principle, abstractly, dolly approved of annaâ€™s action; but
to see the man for whose sake her action had been taken was disagreeable
to her. moreover, she had never liked vronsky. she thought him very
proud, and saw nothing in him of which he could be proud except his
wealth. but against her own will, here in his own house, he overawed her
more than ever, and she could not be at ease with him. she felt with him
the same feeling she had had with the maid about her dressing jacket.
just as with the maid she had felt not ex
 
 ___________________________
 
actly ashamed, but embarrassed
at her darns, so she felt with him not exactly ashamed, but embarrassed
at herself.

dolly was ill at ease, and tried to find a subject of conversation. even
though she supposed that, through his pride, praise of his house and
garden would be sure to be disagreeable to him, she did all the same
tell him how much she liked his house.

"yes, itâ€™s a very fine building, and in the good old-fashioned style,"
he said.

"i like so much the court in front of the steps. was that always so?"

"oh, no!" he said, and his face beamed with pleasure. "if you could only
have seen that court last s

drovnaâ€™s praise.

"if you would care to look at the hospital, and are not tired, indeed,
itâ€™s not far. shall we go?" he said, glancing into her face to convince
himself that she was not bored. "are you coming, anna?" he turned to
her.

"we will come, wonâ€™t we?" she said, addressing sviazhsky. "_mais il ne
faut pas laisser le pauvre veslovsky et tushkevitch se morfondre lÃ  dans
le bateau._ we must send and tell them."

"yes, this is a monument he is setting up here," said anna, turning to
dolly with that sly smile of comprehension with which she had previously
talked about the hospital.

"oh, itâ€™s a work of real importance!" said sviazhsky. but to show he was
not trying to ingratiate himself with vronsky, he promptly added some
slightly critical remarks.

"i wonder, though, count," he said, "that while you do so much for the
health of the peasants, you take so little interest in the schools."

"_câ€™est devenu tellement commun les Ã©coles,_" said vronsky. "you

the corridor. here vronsky showed
them the mechanism for ventilation on a novel system. then he showed
them marble baths, and beds with extraordinary springs. then he showed
them the wards one after another, the storeroom, the linen room, then
the heating stove of a new pattern, then the trolleys, which would make
no noise as they carried everything needed along the corridors, and many
other things. sviazhsky, as a connoisseur in the latest mechanical
improvements, appreciated everything fully. dolly simply wondered at all
she had not seen before, and, anxious to understand it all, made minute
inquiries about everything, which gave vronsky great satisfaction.

"yes, i imagine that this will be the solitary example of a properly
fitted hospital in russia," said sviazhsky.

"and wonâ€™t you have a lying-in ward?" asked dolly. "thatâ€™s so much
needed in the country. i have often..."

in spite of his usual courtesy, vronsky interrupted her.

"this is not a lying-in home, but a hospital for the

 make her write. i donâ€™t likeâ€”iâ€™m almost
unable to speak about this to her."

"very well, i will talk to her. but how is it she does not think of it
herself?" said darya alexandrovna, and for some reason she suddenly at
that point recalled annaâ€™s strange new habit of half-closing her eyes.
and she remembered that anna drooped her eyelids just when the deeper
questions of life were touched upon. "just as though she half-shut her
eyes to her own life, so as not to see everything," thought dolly. "yes,
indeed, for my own sake and for hers i will talk to her," dolly said in
reply to his look of gratitude.

they got up and walked to the house.



chapter 22


when anna found dolly at home before her, she looked intently in her
eyes, as though questioning her about the talk she had had with vronsky,
but she made no inquiry in words.

"i believe itâ€™s dinner time," she said. "weâ€™ve not seen each other at
all yet. i am reckoning on the evening. now i want to go and dress. i
expect you do

 too; we all got splashed at the buildings."

dolly went to her room and she felt amused. to change her dress was
impossible, for she had already put on her best dress. but in order to
signify in some way her preparation for dinner, she asked the maid to
brush her dress, changed her cuffs and tie, and put some lace on her
head.

"this is all i can do," she said with a smile to anna, who came in to
her in a third dress, again of extreme simplicity.

"yes, we are too formal here," she said, as it were apologizing for her
magnificence. "alexey is d

wing room they found princess varvara already there, and the
gentlemen of the party in black frock-coats. the architect wore a
swallow-tail coat. vronsky presented the doctor and the steward to his
guest. the architect he had already introduced to her at the hospital.

a stout butler, resplendent with a smoothly shaven round chin and a
starched white cravat, announced that dinner was ready, and the ladies
got up. vronsky asked sviazhsky to take in anna arkadyevna, and himself
offered his arm to dolly. veslovsky was before tushkevitch in offering
his arm to princess varvara, so that tushkevitch with the steward and
the doctor walked in alone.

the dinner, the dining room, the service, the waiting at table, the
wine, and the food, were not simply in keeping with the general tone of
modern luxury throughout all the house, but seemed even more sumptuous
and modern. darya alexandrovna watched this luxury which was novel to
her, and as a good housekeeper used to managing a householdâ€”although sh

business."

"the american way of doing business," said sviazhsky, with a smile.

"yes, there they build in a rational fashion..."

the conversation passed to the misuse of political power in the united
states, but anna quickly brought it round to another topic, so as to
draw the steward into talk.

"have you ever seen a reaping machine?" she said, addressing darya
alexandrovna. "we had just ridden over to look at one when we met. itâ€™s
the first time i ever saw one."

"how do they work?" asked dolly.

"exactly like little scissors. a plank and a lot of little scissors.
like this."

anna took a knife and fork in her beautiful white hands covered with
rings, and began showing how the machine worked. it was clear that she
saw nothing would be understood from her explanation; but aware that her
talk was pleasant and her hands beautiful she went on explaining.

"more like little penknives," veslovsky said playfully, never taking his
eyes off her.

anna gave a just perceptible smile, but made no

n."

"what a pity!" said anna, and having thus paid the dues of civility to
her domestic circle, she turned to her own friends.

"it would be a hard task, though, to construct a machine from your
description, anna arkadyevna," sviazhsky said jestingly.

"oh, no, why so?" said anna with a smile that betrayed that she knew
there was something charming in her disquisitions upon the machine that
had been noticed by sviazhsky. this new trait of girlish coquettishness
made an unpleasant impression on dolly.

"but anna arkadyevnaâ€™s knowledge of architecture is marvelous," said
tushkevitch.

"to be sure, i heard anna arkadyevna talking yesterday about plinths and
damp-courses," said veslovsky. "have i got it right?"

"thereâ€™s nothing marvelous about it, when one sees and hears so much of
it," said anna. "but, i dare say, you donâ€™t even know what houses are
made of?"

darya alexandrovna saw that anna disliked the tone of raillery that
existed between her and veslovsky, but fell in with it agai

y."

anna spoke lightly, but irritation could be discerned in her tone. darya
alexandrovna, watching anna and vronsky attentively, detected it
instantly. she noticed, too, that as she spoke vronskyâ€™s face had
immediately taken a serious and obstinate expression. noticing this, and
that princess varvara at once made haste to change the conversation by
talking of petersburg acquaintances, and remembering what vronsky had
without apparent connection said in the garden of his work in the
country, dolly surmised that this question of public activity was
connected with some deep private disagreement between anna and vronsky.

the dinner, the wine, the decoration of the table were all very good;
but it was all like what darya alexandrovna had seen at formal dinners
and balls which of late years had become quite unfamiliar to her; it all
had the same impersonal and constrained character, and so on an ordinary
day and in a little circle of friends it made a disagreeable impression
on her.

after d

which she had so hated on the way, now, after a day spent without them,
struck her in quite another light, and tempted her back to them.

when, after evening tea and a row by night in the boat, darya
alexandrovna went alone to her room, took off her dress, and began
arranging her thin hair for the night, she had a great sense of relief.

it was positively disagreeable to her to think that anna was coming to
see her immediately. she longed to be alone with her own thoughts.



chapter 23


dolly was wanting to go to bed when anna came in to see her, attired for
the night. in the course of the day anna had several times begun to
speak of matters near her heart, and every time after a few words she
had stopped: "afterwards, by ourselves, weâ€™ll talk about everything.
iâ€™ve got so much i want to tell you," she said.

now they were by themselves, and anna did not know what to talk about.
she sat in the window looking at dolly, and going over in her own mind
all the stores of intimate tal

k which had seemed so inexhaustible
beforehand, and she found nothing. at that moment it seemed to her that
everything had been said already.

"well, what of kitty?" she said with a heavy sigh, looking penitently at
dolly. "tell me the truth, dolly: isnâ€™t she angry with me?"

"angry? oh, no!" said darya alexandrovna, smiling.

"but she hates me, despises me?"

"oh, no! but you know that sort of thing isnâ€™t forgiven."

"yes, yes," said anna, turning away and looking out of the open window.
"but i was not to blame. and who is to blame? whatâ€™s the meaning of
being to blame? could it have been otherwise? what do you think? could
it possibly have happened that you didnâ€™t become the wife of stiva?"

"really, i donâ€™t know. but this is 
 
 ___________________________
 
what i want you to tell me..."

"yes, yes, but weâ€™ve not finished about kitty. is she happy? heâ€™s a very
nice man, they say."

"heâ€™s much more than very nice. i donâ€™t know a better man."

"ah, how glad i am! iâ€™m so glad! much more than very nice," she
repeated.

dolly smiled.

"but tell me about yourself. weâ€™ve a great deal to talk about. and iâ€™ve
had a talk with..." dolly did not know what to call him. she felt it
awkward to call him either the count or alexey kirillovitch.

"with alexey," said anna, "i know what you talked about. but i wanted to
ask you directly what you think of me, of my life?"

"how am i to say like that straight off? i really donâ€™t know."

"no, tell me all the same.... you see my life. but you mustnâ€™t forget
that youâ€™re seeing us in the summer, when you have come to us and we are
not alone.... but we came here early in the spring, liv

living alone without him, alone, and that will be ... i see by
everything that it will often be repeated, that he will be half the time
away from home," she said, getting up and sitting down close by dolly.

"of course," she interrupted dolly, who would have answered, "of course
i wonâ€™t try to keep him by force. i donâ€™t keep him indeed. the races are
just coming, his horses are running, he will go. iâ€™m very glad. but
think of me, fancy my position.... but whatâ€™s the use of talking about
it?" she smiled. "well, what did he talk about with you?"

"he spoke of what i want to speak about of myself, and itâ€™s easy for me
to be his advocate; of whether there is not a possibility ... whether
you could not..." (darya alexandrovna h

ay that itâ€™s egoism, but what a legitimate and noble egoism. he
wants first of all to legitimize his daughter, and to be your husband,
to have a legal right to you."

"what wife, what slave can be so utterly a slave as i, in my position?"
she put in gloomily.

"the chief thing he desires ... he desires that you should not suffer."

"thatâ€™s impossible. well?"

"well, and the most legitimate desireâ€”he wishes that your children
should have a name."

"what children?" anna said, not looking at dolly, and half closing her
eyes.

"annie and those to come..."

"he need not trouble on that score; i shall have no more children."

"how can you tell that you wonâ€™t?"

"i shall not, because i donâ€™t wish it." and, in spite of all her
emotion, anna smiled, as she caught the naÃ¯ve expression of curiosity,
wonder, and horror on dollyâ€™s face.

"the doctor told me after my illness..."

"impossible!" said dolly, opening her eyes wide.

for her this was one of those discoveries the consequences and

he deserted her and took another. and can anna attract and keep count
vronsky in that way? if that is what he looks for, he will find dresses
and manners still more attractive and charming. and however white and
beautiful her bare arms are, however beautiful her full figure and her
eager face under her black curls, he will find something better still,
just as my disgusting, pitiful, and charming husband does."

dolly made no answer, she merely sighed. anna noticed this sigh,
indicating dissent, and she went on. in her armory she had other
arguments so strong that no answer could be made to them.

"do you say that itâ€™s not right? but you must consider," she went on;
"you forget my position. how can i desire children? iâ€™m not speaking of
the suffering, iâ€™m not afraid of that. think only, what are my children
to be? ill-fated children, who will have to bear a strangerâ€™s name. for
the very fact of their

 birth they will be forced to be ashamed of their
mother, their father, their birth."

"but that is just why a divorce is necessary." but anna did not hear
her. she longed to give utterance to all the arguments with which she
had so many times convinced herself.

"what is reason given me for, if i am not to use it to avoid bringing
unhappy beings into the world!" she looked at dolly, but without waiting
for a reply she went on:

"i should always feel i had wronged these unhappy children," she said.
"if they are not, at any rate they are not unhappy; while if they are
unhappy, i alone should be to blame for it."

these were the very arguments darya alexandrovna had used in her own
reflections; but she heard them without understanding them. "how can one
wrong creatures that donâ€™t exist?" she thought. and all at once the idea
struck her: could it possibly, under any circums

tances, have been better
for her favorite grisha if he had never existed? and this seemed to her
so wild, so strange, that she shook her head to drive away this tangle
of whirling, mad ideas.

"no, i donâ€™t know; itâ€™s not right," was all she said, with an expression
of disgust on her face.

"yes, but you mustnâ€™t forget that you and i.... and besides that," added
anna, in spite of the wealth of her arguments and the poverty of dollyâ€™s
objections, seeming still to admit that it was not right, "donâ€™t forget
the chief point, that i am not now in the same position as you. for you
the question is: do you desire not to have any more children; while for
me it is: do i desire to have them? and thatâ€™s a great difference. you
must see that i canâ€™t desire it in my position."

darya alexandrovna made no reply. she suddenly felt that she had got far
away from anna; that there lay between them a barrier of questions on
which the

chapter 24


"then there is all the more reason for you to legalize your position, if
possible," said dolly.

"yes, if possible," said anna, speaking all at once in an utterly
different tone, subdued and mournful.

"surely you donâ€™t mean a divorce is impossible? i was told your husband
had consented to it."

"dolly, i donâ€™t want to talk about that."

"oh, we wonâ€™t then," darya alexandrovna hastened to say, noticing the
expression of suffering on annaâ€™s face. "all i see is that you take too
gloomy a view of things."

"i? not at all! iâ€™m always bright and happy. you see, _je fais des
passions._ veslovsky..."

"yes, to tell the truth, i donâ€™t like veslovskyâ€™s tone," said darya
alexandrovna, anxious to change the subject.

"oh, thatâ€™s nonsense! it amuses alexey, and thatâ€™s all; but heâ€™s a bo

as it might be with your grisha.... dolly!"â€”she suddenly changed the
subjectâ€”"you say i take too gloomy a view of things. you canâ€™t
understand. itâ€™s too awful! i try not to take any view of it at all."

"but i think you ought to. you ought to do all you can."

"but what can i do? nothing. you tell me to marry alexey, and say i
donâ€™t think about it. i donâ€™t think about it!" she repeated, and a flush
rose into her face. she got up, straightening her chest, and sighed
heavily. with her light step she began pacing up and down t

fusal or consent.... well, i have received his
consent, say..." anna was at that moment at the furthest end of the
room, and she stopped there, doing something to the curtain at the
window. "i receive his consent, but my ... my son? they wonâ€™t give him
up to me. he will grow up despising me, with his father, whom iâ€™ve
abandoned. do you see, i love ... equally, i think, but both more than
myselfâ€”two creatures, seryozha and alexey."

she came out into the middle of the room and stood facing dolly, with
her arms pressed tightly across her chest. in her white dressing gown
her figure seemed more than usually grand and broad. she bent her head,
and with shining, wet eyes looked from under her brows at dolly, a thin
little pitiful figure in her patched dressing jacket and nightcap,
shaking all over with emotion.

"it is only those two creatures that i love, and one excludes the other.
i canâ€™t have them together, and thatâ€™s the only thing i want. and since
i canâ€™t have that, i donâ€™t

i donâ€™t like to talk of it. so donâ€™t blame me, donâ€™t judge me for
anything. you canâ€™t with your pure heart understand all that iâ€™m
suffering." she went up, sat down beside dolly, and with a guilty look,
peeped into her face and took her hand.

"what are you thinking? what are you thinking about me? donâ€™t despise
me. i donâ€™t deserve contempt. iâ€™m simply unhappy. if anyone is unhappy,
i am," she articulated, and turning away, she burst into tears.

left alone, darya alexandrovna said her prayers and went to bed. she had
felt for anna with all her heart while she was speaking to her, but now
she could not force herself to think of her. the memories of home and of

d she made up her mind that she would certainly
go back next day.

anna meantime went back to her boudoir, took a wine glass and dropped
into it several drops of a medicine, of which the principal ingredient
was morphine. after drinking it off and sitting still a little while,
she went into her bedroom in a soothed and more cheerful frame of mind.

when she went into the bedroom, vronsky looked intently at her. he was
looking for traces of the conversation which he knew that, staying so
long in dollyâ€™s room, she must have had with her. but in her expression
of restrained excitement, and of a sort of reserve, he could find
nothing but the beauty that always bewitched him afresh though he was
used to it, the consciousness of it, and the desire that it should
affect him. he did not want to ask her what they had been talking of,
but he hoped that she would tell him something of her own accord. but
she only said:

"i am so glad you like dolly. you do, donâ€™t you?"

"oh, iâ€™ve known her a lon

journey. levinâ€™s coachman, in his by no means new coat and shabby hat,
with his ill-matched horses and his coach with the patched mud-guards,
drove with gloomy determination into the covered gravel approach.

darya alexandrovna disliked taking leave of princess varvara and the
gentlemen of the party. after a day spent together, both she and her
hosts were distinctly aware that they did not get on together, and that
it was better for them not to meet. only anna was sad. she knew that
now, from dollyâ€™s departure, no one again would stir up within her soul
the feelings that had been roused by their conversation. it hurt her to
stir up these feelings, but yet she knew that that was the best part of
her soul, and that that part of her soul would quickly be smothered in
the life she was leading.

as she drove out into the open country, darya alexandrovna had a
delightful sense of relief, and she felt tempted to ask the two men how
they had liked being at vronskyâ€™s, when suddenly the coachma

kopecks. at our place, no fear, all comers may have as much as they can

"the masterâ€™s a screw," put in the counting house clerk.

"well, did you like their horses?" asked dolly.

"the horses!â€”thereâ€™s no two opinions about them. and the food was good.
but it seemed to me sort of dreary there, darya alexandrovna. i donâ€™t
know what you thought," he said, turning his handsome, good-natured face
to her.

"i thought so too. well, shall we get home by evening?"

"eh, we must!"

on reaching home and finding everyone entirely satisfactory and
particularly charming, darya alexandrovna began with great liveliness

chapter 1


the levins had been three months in moscow. the date had long passed on
which, according to the most trustworthy calculations of people learned
in such matters, kitty should have been confined. but she was still
about, and there was nothing to show that her time was any nearer than
two months ago. the doctor, the monthly nurse, and dolly and her mother,
and most of all levin, who could not think of the approaching event
without terror, began to be impatient and uneasy. kitty was the only
person who felt perfectly calm and happy.

she was distinctly conscious now of the birth of a new feeling of love
for the future child, for her to some extent actually existing already,

"will it be soon? how do you feel?" he whispered, taking her two hands.

"i have so often thought so, that now i donâ€™t think about it or know
anything about it."

"and youâ€™re not frightened?"

she smiled contemptuously.

"not the least little bit," she said.

"well, if anything happens, i shall be at katavasovâ€™s."

"no, nothing will happen, and donâ€™t think about it. iâ€™m going for a walk
on the boulevard with papa. weâ€™re going to see dolly. i shall expect you
before dinner. oh, yes! do you know that dollyâ€™s position is becoming
utterly impossible? sheâ€™s in debt all round; she hasnâ€™t a penny. we were
talking yesterday with mamma and arseny" (this was her sisterâ€™s husband
lvov), "and we determined to send you with him to talk to stiva. itâ€™s
really unbearable. one canâ€™t speak to papa about it.... but if you and
he..."

shout of a sledge driver coming towards them, saw in the uncertain light
the red blind of a tavern and the shops, this impression was dissipated,
and he began to think over his actions, and to wonder whether he was
doing right in going to see anna. what would kitty say? but stepan
arkadyevitch gave him no time for reflection, and, as though divining
his doubts, he scattered them.

"how glad i am," he said, "that you should know her! you know dolly has
long wished for it. and lvovâ€™s been to see her, and often goes. though
she is my sister," stepan arkadyevitch pursued, "i donâ€™t hesitate to say
that sheâ€™s a remarkable woman. but you will see. her position is very
painful, especially now."

"why especially now?"

"we are carrying on negotiations with her husband about a divorce. and
heâ€™s agreed; but there are difficulties in regard to the son, and the
business, which ought to have been arranged long ago, has been dragging

put in. "well, then their position will be as regular as mine, as
yours."

"what is the difficulty?" said levin.

"oh, itâ€™s a long and tedious story! the whole business is in such an
anomalous position with us. but the point is she has been for three
months in moscow, where everyone knows her, waiting for the divorce; she
goes out nowhere, sees no woman except dolly, because, do you
understand, she doesnâ€™t care to have people come as a favor. that fool
princess varvara, even she has left her, considering this a breach of
propriety. well, you see, in such a position any other woman would not
have found resources in herself. but youâ€™ll see how she has arranged her
lifeâ€”how calm, how dignified she is. to the left, in the crescent
opposite the church!" shouted stepan arkadyevitch, leaning out of the
window. "phew! how hot it is!" he said, in spite of twe

looked from the portrait to the original. a peculiar brilliance
lighted up annaâ€™s face when she felt his eyes on her. levin flushed, and
to cover his confusion would have asked whether she had seen darya
alexandrovna lately; but at that moment anna spoke. "we were just
talking, ivan petrovitch and i, of vashtchenkovâ€™s last pictures. have
you seen them?"

"yes, i have seen them," answered levin.

"but, i beg your pardon, i interrupted you ... you were saying?..."

levin asked if she had seen dolly lately.

"she was here yesterday. she was very indignant with the high school
people on grishaâ€™s account. the latin teacher, it seems, had been unfair
to him."

"yes, i have seen his pictures. i didnâ€™t care for them very much," levin
went back to the subject she had started.

levin talked now not at all with that purely businesslike attitude to
the subject with which he had been talking all the morning. every word
in his conversation with her had a special significance. and talking to

o?"

"stiva urged me awfully to go and see anna arkadyevna."

and as he said this, levin blushed even more, and his doubts as to
whether he had done right in going to see anna were settled once for
all. he knew now that he ought not to have done so.

kittyâ€™s eyes opened in a curious way and gleamed at annaâ€™s name, but
controlling herself with an effort, she concealed her emotion and
deceived him.

"oh!" was all she said.

"iâ€™m sure you wonâ€™t be angry at my going. stiva begged me to, and dolly
wished it," levin went on.

"oh, no!" she said, but he saw in her eyes a constraint that boded him
no good.

"she is a very sweet, very, very unhappy, good woman," he said, telling
her about anna, her occupations, and what she had told him to say to
her.

"yes, of course, she is very much to be pitied," said kitty, when he had
finished. "whom was your letter from?"

he told her, and believing in her calm tone, he went to change his coat.

coming back, he found kitty in the same easy chair. when

he dressed, and while they were putting in his horses, as a hired sledge
was not to be seen yet, he ran again up to the bedroom, not on tiptoe,
it seemed to him, but on wings. two maid-servants were carefully moving
something in the bedroom.

kitty was walking about knitting rapidly and giving directions.

"iâ€™m going for the doctor. they have sent for lizaveta petrovna, but
iâ€™ll go on there too. isnâ€™t there anything wanted? yes, shall i go to
dollyâ€™s?"

she looked at him, obviously not hearing what he was saying.

"yes, yes. do go," she said quickly, frowning and waving her hand to
him.

he had just gone into the drawing room, when suddenly a plaintive moan
sounded from the bedroom, smothered instantly. he stood still, and for a
long while he could not understand.

"yes, that is she," he said to himself, and clutching at his head he ran
downstairs.

"lord have mercy on us! pardon us! aid us!" he repeated the words that

nd a screen, and he found that it was five oâ€™clock in the afternoon.
if he had been told it was only ten oâ€™clock in the morning, he would not
have been more surprised. where he was all this time, he knew as little
as the time of anything. he saw her swollen face, sometimes bewildered
and in agony, sometimes smiling and trying to reassure him. he saw the
old princess too, flushed and overwrought, with her gray curls in
disorder, forcing herself to gulp down her tears, biting her lips; he
saw dolly too and the doctor, smoking fat cigarettes, and lizaveta
petrovna with a firm, resolute, reassuring face, and the old prince
walking up and down the hall with a frowning face. but why they came in
and went out, where they were, he did not know. the princess was with
the doctor in the bedroom, then in the study, where a table set for
dinner suddenly appeared; then she was not there, but dolly was. then
levin remembered he had been sent somewhere. once he had been sent to
move a table and sofa. h

 and with the princessâ€™s old waiting maid he had
clambered on a shelf to reach it and had broken the little lamp, and the
old servant had tried to reassure him about the lamp and about his wife,
and he carried the holy picture and set it at kittyâ€™s head, carefully
tucking it in behind the pillow. but where, when, and why all this had
happened, he could not tell. he did not understand why the old princess
took his hand, and looking compassionately at him, begged him not to
worry himself, and dolly persuaded him to eat something and led him out
of the room, and even the doctor looked seriously and with commiseration
at him and offered him a drop of something.

all he knew and felt was that what was happening was what had happened
nearly a year before in the hotel of the country town at the deathbed of
his brother nikolay. but that had been griefâ€”this was joy. yet that
grief and this joy were alike outside all the ordinary conditions of
life; they were loop-holes, as it were, in that ord

unable to keep up with it.

"lord, have mercy on us, and succor us!" he repeated to himself
incessantly, feeling, in spite of his long and, as it seemed, complete
alienation from religion, that he turned to god just as trustfully and
simply as he had in his childhood and first youth.

all this time he had two distinct spiritual conditions. one was away
from her, with the doctor, who kept smoking one fat cigarette after
another and extinguishing them on the edge of a full ash tray, with
dolly, and with the old prince, where there was talk about dinner, about
politics, about marya petrovnaâ€™s illness, and where levin suddenly
forgot for a minute what was happening, and felt as though he had waked
up from sleep; the other was in her presence, at her pillow, where his
heart seemed breaking and still did not break from sympathetic
suffering, and he prayed to god without ceasing. and every time he was
brought back from a moment of oblivion by a scream reaching him from the
bedroom, he f

agonizing became both her sufferings
and his feeling of helplessness before them. he jumped up, would have
liked to run away, but ran to her.

sometimes, when again and again she called upon him, he blamed her; but
seeing her patient, smiling face, and hearing the words, "i am worrying
you," he threw the blame on god; but thinking of god, at once he fell to
beseeching god to forgive him and have mercy.

he did not know whether it was late or early. the candles had all burned
out. dolly had just been in the study and had suggested to the doctor
that he should lie down. levin sat listening to the doctorâ€™s stories of
a quack mesmerizer and looking at the ashes of his cigarette. there had
been a period of repose, and he had sunk into oblivion. he had
completely forgotten what was going on now. he heard the doctorâ€™s chat
and understood it. suddenly there came an unearthly shriek. the shriek
was so awful that levin did not even jump up, but holding his breath,
gazed in terrifie

™t go, donâ€™t go! iâ€™m not afraid, iâ€™m not afraid!" she said rapidly.
"mamma, take my earrings. they bother me. youâ€™re not afraid? quick,
quick, lizaveta petrovna..."

she spoke quickly, very quickly, and tried to smile. but suddenly her
face was drawn, she pushed him away.

"oh, this is awful! iâ€™m dying, iâ€™m dying! go away!" she shrieked, and
again he heard that unearthly scream.

levin clutched at his head and ran out of the room.

"itâ€™s nothing, itâ€™s nothing, itâ€™s all right," dolly called after him.

but they might say what they liked, he knew now that all was over. he
stood in the next room, his head leaning against the door post, and
heard shrieks, howls such as he had never heard before, and he knew that
what had been kitty was uttering these shrieks. he had long ago ceased
to wish for the child. by now he loathed this child. he did not even
wish for her life now, all he longed for was the end of this awful
anguish.

"doctor! what is it? what is it? by god!" he said, s

hers.

the appointment yielded an income of from seven to ten thousand a year,
and oblonsky could fill it without giving up his government position. it
was in the hands of two ministers, one lady, and two jews, and all these
people, though the way had been paved already with them, stepan
arkadyevitch had to see in petersburg. besides this business, stepan
arkadyevitch had promised his sister anna to obtain from karenin a
definite answer on the question of divorce. and begging fifty roubles
from dolly, he set off for petersburg.

stepan arkadyevitch sat in kareninâ€™s study listening to his report on
the causes of the unsatisfactory position of russian finance, and only
waiting for the moment when he would finish to speak about his own
business or about anna.

"yes, thatâ€™s very true," he said, when alexey alexandrovitch took off
the pince-nez, without which he could not read now, and looked
inquiringly at his former brother-in-law, "thatâ€™s very true in
particular cases, but still the pri

clear," she thought, and in silence, without
looking round, she walked with faltering steps out of the room. "he
loves another woman, thatâ€™s even clearer," she said to herself as she
went into her own room. "i want love, and there is none. so, then, all
is over." she repeated the words she had said, "and it must be ended."

"but how?" she asked herself, and she sat down in a low chair before the
looking glass.

thoughts of where she would go now, whether to the aunt who had brought
her up, to dolly, or simply alone abroad, and of what _he_ was doing now
alone in his study; whether this was the final quarrel, or whether
reconciliation were still possible; and of what all her old friends at
petersburg would say of her now; and of how alexey alexandrovitch would
look at it, and many other ideas of what would happen now after this
rupture, came into her head; but she did not give herself up to them
with all her heart. at the bottom of her heart was some obscure idea
that alone interested her,

essenger who had come back in the carriage. she went down to
him.

"we didnâ€™t catch the count. the count had driven off on the lower city
road."

"what do you say? what!..." she said to the rosy, good-humored mihail,
as he handed her back her note.

"why, then, he has never received it!" she thought.

"go with this note to countess vronskayaâ€™s place, you know? and bring an
answer back immediately," she said to the messenger.

"and i, what am i going to do?" she thought. "yes, iâ€™m going to dollyâ€™s,
thatâ€™s true or else i shall go out of my mind. yes, and i can telegraph,
too." and she wrote a telegram. "i absolutely must talk to you; come at
once." after sending off the telegram, she went to dress. when she was
dressed and in her hat, she glanced again into the eyes of the plump,
comfortable-looking annushka. there was unmistakable sympathy in those
good-natured little gray eyes.

"annushka, dear, what am i to do?" said anna, sobbing and sinking
helplessly into a chair.

 now the thought of
death seemed no longer so terrible and so clear to her, and death itself
no longer seemed so inevitable. now she blamed herself for the
humiliation to which she had lowered herself. "i entreat him to forgive
me. i have given in to him. i have owned myself in fault. what for?
canâ€™t i live without him?" and leaving unanswered the question how she
was going to live without him, she fell to reading the signs on the
shops. "office and warehouse. dental surgeon. yes, iâ€™ll tell dolly all
about it. she doesnâ€™t like vronsky. i shall be sick and ashamed, but
iâ€™ll tell her. she loves me, and iâ€™ll follow her advice. i wonâ€™t give in
to him; i wonâ€™t let him train me as he pleases. filippov, bun shop. they
say they send their dough to petersburg. the moscow water is so good for
it. ah, the springs at mitishtchen, and the pancakes!"

and she remembered how, long, long ago, when she was a girl of
seventeen, she had gone with her aunt to troitsa. "riding, too. was that

a man bowed to her. it was annushkaâ€™s husband. "our parasites"; she
remembered how vronsky had said that. "our? why our? whatâ€™s so awful is
that one canâ€™t tear up the past by its roots. one canâ€™t tear it out, but
one can hide oneâ€™s memory of it. and iâ€™ll hide it." and then she thought
of her past with alexey alexandrovitch, of how she had blotted the
memory of it out of her life. "dolly will think iâ€™m leaving my second
husband, and so i certainly must be in the wrong. as if i cared to be
right! i canâ€™t help it!" she said, and she wanted to cry. but at once
she fell to wondering what those two girls could be smiling about.
"love, most likely. they donâ€™t know how dreary it is, how low.... the

to herself. "no, iâ€™ll go to dolly, and say straight out to her, iâ€™m

these horses, this carriageâ€”how loathsome i am to myself in this
carriageâ€”all his; but i wonâ€™t see them again."

thinking over the words in which she would tell dolly, and mentally
working her heart up to great bitterness, anna went upstairs.

"is there anyone with her?" she asked in the hall.

"katerina alexandrovna levin," answered the footman.

"kitty! kitty, whom vronsky was in love with!" thought anna, "the girl
he thinks of with love. heâ€™s sorry he didnâ€™t marry her. but me he thinks
of with hatred, and is sorry he had anything to do with me."

the sisters were having a consultation about nursing when anna called.
dolly went down alone to see the vi

sitor who had interrupted their
conversation.

"well, so youâ€™ve not gone away yet? i meant to have come to you," she
said; "i had a letter from stiva today."

"we had a telegram too," answered anna, looking round for kitty.

"he writes that he canâ€™t make out quite what alexey alexandrovitch
wants, but he wonâ€™t go away without a decisive answer."

"i thought you had someone with you. can i see the letter?"

"yes; kitty," said dolly, embarrassed. "she stayed in the nursery. she
has been very ill."

"so i heard. may i see the letter?"

"iâ€™ll get it directly. but he doesnâ€™t refuse; on the contrary, stiva has
hopes," said dolly, stopping in the doorway.

"i havenâ€™t, and indeed i donâ€™t wish it," said anna.

"whatâ€™s this? does kitty consider it degrading to meet me?" thought anna
when she was alone. "perhaps sheâ€™s right, too. but itâ€™s not for her, the
girl who was in love with vronsky, itâ€™s not for her to show m

e that,
even if it is true. i know that in my position i canâ€™t be received by
any decent woman. i knew that from the first moment i sacrificed
everything to him. and this is my reward! oh, how i hate him! and what
did i come here for? iâ€™m worse here, more miserable." she heard from the
next room the sistersâ€™ voices in consultation. "and what am i going to
say to dolly now? amuse kitty by the sight of my wretchedness, submit to
her patronizing? no; and besides, dolly wouldnâ€™t understand. and it
would be no good my telling her. it would only be interesting to see
kitty, to show her how i despise everyone and everything, how nothing
matters to me now."

dolly came in with the letter. anna read it and handed it back in
silence.

"i knew all that," she said, "and it doesnâ€™t interest me in the least."

"oh, why so? on the contrary, i have hopes," said dolly, looking
inquisitively at anna. she had never seen her in such a strangely
irritable condition. "when 
 
 ___________________________
 
are you going away?" she asked.

anna, half-closing her eyes, looked straight before her and did not
answer.

"why does kitty shrink from me?" she said, looking at the door and
flushing red.

"oh, what nonsense! sheâ€™s nursing, and things arenâ€™t going right with
her, and iâ€™ve been advising her.... sheâ€™s delighted. sheâ€™ll be here in a
minute," said dolly awkwardly, not clever at lying. "yes, here she is."

hearing that anna had called, kitty had wanted not to appear, but dolly
persuaded her. rallying her forces, kitty went in, walked up to her,
blushing, and shook hands.

"i am so glad to see you," she said with a trembling voice.

kitty had been thrown into confusion by the inward conflict between her
antagonism to this bad woman and her desire to be nice to her. but as
soon as she saw annaâ€™s lovely and attractive face, all feeling of
antagonism disappeared.

"i should not have been surprised if you had not cared to meet me. iâ€™m
used to everything. you have been

but again not answering, anna turned to kitty.

"yes, i am very glad to have seen you," she said with a smile. "i have
heard so much of you from everyone, even from your husband. he came to
see me, and i liked him exceedingly," she said, unmistakably with
malicious intent. "where is he?"

"he has gone back to the country," said kitty, blushing.

"remember me to him, be sure you do."

"iâ€™ll be sure to!" kitty said naÃ¯vely, looking compassionately into her
eyes.

"so good-bye, dolly." and kissing dolly and shaking hands with kitty,
anna went out hurriedly.

"sheâ€™s just the same and just as charming! sheâ€™s very lovely!" said
kitty, when she was alone with her sister. "but thereâ€™s something
piteous about her. awfully piteous!"

"yes, thereâ€™s something unusual about her today," said dolly. "when i
went with her into the hall, i fancied she was almost crying."

e. to her previous tortures was added now that
sense of mortification and of being an outcast which she had felt so
distinctly on meeting kitty.

"where to? home?" asked pyotr.

"yes, home," she said, not even thinking now where she was going.

"how they looked at me as something dreadful, incomprehensible, and
curious! what can he be telling the other with such warmth?" she
thought, staring at two men who walked by. "can one ever tell anyone
what one is feeling? i meant to tell dolly, and itâ€™s a good thing i
didnâ€™t tell her. how pleased she would have been at my misery! she would
have concealed it, but her chief feeling would have been delight at my
being punished for the happiness she envied me for. kitty, she would
have been even more pleased. how i can see through her! she knows i was

katavasov; "while we in town think of nothing but the servian war. well,
how does our friend look at it? heâ€™s sure not to think like other
people."

"oh, i donâ€™t know, like everybody else," kitty answered, a little
embarrassed, looking round at sergey ivanovitch. "iâ€™ll send to fetch
him. papaâ€™s staying with us. heâ€™s only just come home from abroad."

and making arrangements to send for levin and for the guests to wash,
one in his room and the other in what had been dollyâ€™s, and giving
orders for their luncheon, kitty ran out onto the balcony, enjoying the
freedom, and rapidity of movement, of which she had been deprived during
the months of her pregnancy.

"itâ€™s sergey ivanovitch and katavasov, a professor," she said.

"oh, thatâ€™s a bore in this heat," said the prince.

"no, papa, heâ€™s very nice, and kostyaâ€™s very fond of him," kitty said,
with a deprecating smile, noticing the irony on her fatherâ€™s face.

"oh, i didnâ€™t say anything."

"you go to

thoughts, she remembered that some spiritual question of importance had
been interrupted, and she began to recall what. "yes, kostya, an
unbeliever," she thought again with a smile.

"well, an unbeliever then! better let him always be one than like madame
stahl, or what i tried to be in those days abroad. no, he wonâ€™t ever
sham anything."

and a recent instance of his goodness rose vividly to her mind. a
fortnight ago a penitent letter had come from stepan arkadyevitch to
dolly. he besought her to save his honor, to sell her estate to pay his
debts. dolly was in despair, she detested her husband, despised him,
pitied him, resolved on a separation, resolved to refuse, but ended by
agreeing to sell part of her property. after that, with an irrepressible
smile of tenderness, kitty recalled her husbandâ€™s shamefaced
embarrassment, his repeated awkward efforts to approach the subject, and
how at last, having thought of the one means of helping dolly without
wounding her p

ride, he had suggested to kittyâ€”what had not occurred to
her beforeâ€”that she should give up her share of the property.

"he an unbeliever indeed! with his heart, his dread of offending anyone,
even a child! everything for others, nothing for himself. sergey
ivanovitch simply considers it as kostyaâ€™s duty to be his steward. and
itâ€™s the same with his sister. now dolly and her children are under his
guardianship; all these peasants who come to him every day, as though he
were bound to be at their service."

"yes, only be like your father, only like him," she said, handing mitya
over to the nurse, and putting her lips to his cheek.

and levin remembered a scene he had lately witnessed between dolly and
her children. the children, left to themselves, had begun cooking
raspberries over the candles and squirting milk into each otherâ€™s mouths
with a syringe. their mother, catching them at these pranks, began
reminding them in levinâ€™s presence of the trouble their mischief gave to
the grown-up people, and that this trouble was all for their sake, and
that if they smashed the cups they would have nothing to drink their tea
out of, and that if they wasted the milk, they would have nothing to

arguments with him of late.

and one of these arguments, in which katavasov had obviously considered
that he came off victorious, was the first thing levin thought of as he
recognized him.

"no, whatever i do, i wonâ€™t argue and give utterance to my ideas
lightly," he thought.

getting out of the trap and greeting his brother and katavasov, levin
asked about his wife.

"she has taken mitya to kolok" (a copse near the house). "she meant to
have him out there because itâ€™s so hot indoors," said dolly. levin had
always advised his wife not to take the baby to the wood, thinking it
unsafe, and he was not pleased to hear this.

"she rushes about from place to place with him," said the prince,
smiling. "i advised her to try putting him in the ice cellar."

"she meant to come to the bee house. she thought you would be there. we
are going there," said dolly.

"well, and what are you doing?" said sergey ivanovitch, falling back
from the rest and walking beside him.

cares that had swarmed about him from the moment he got into the trap

among them. just as his bodily strength was still unaffected, in spite
of the bees, so too was the spiritual strength that he had just become
aware of.

"do you know, kostya, with whom sergey ivanovitch traveled on his way
here?" said dolly, doling out cucumbers and honey to the children; "with
vronsky! heâ€™s going to servia."

"and not alone; heâ€™s taking a squadron out with him at his own expense,"
said katavasov.

"thatâ€™s the right thing for him," said levin. "are volunteers still
going out then?" he added, glancing at sergey ivanovitch.

sergey ivanovitch did not answer. he was carefully with a blunt knife
getting a live bee covered with sticky honey out of a cup full of white
honeycomb.

"i should think so! you should hav

"but the prince is not speaking of help," said levin, coming to the
assistance of his father-in-law, "but of war. the prince says that
private persons cannot take part in war without the permission of the
government."

"kostya, mind, thatâ€™s a bee! really, theyâ€™ll sting us!" said dolly,
waving away a wasp.

"but thatâ€™s not a bee, itâ€™s a wasp," said levin.

"well now, well, whatâ€™s your own theory?" katavasov said to levin with a
smile, distinctly challenging him to a discussion. "why have not private
persons the right to do so?"

"oh, my theoryâ€™s this: war is on one side such a beastly, cruel, and
awful thing, that no one man, not to speak of a christian, can
individually take upon himself the responsibility of beginning wars;
that can only be done by a government, whi

besides me whoâ€™re only interested in russia, and not in their slavonic
brethren. hereâ€™s konstantin too."

"personal opinions mean nothing in such a case," said sergey ivanovitch;
"itâ€™s not a matter of personal opinions when all russiaâ€”the whole
peopleâ€”has expressed its will."

"but excuse me, i donâ€™t see that. the people donâ€™t know anything about
it, if you come to that," said the old prince.

"oh, papa!... how can you say that? and last sunday in church?" said
dolly, listening to the conversation. "please give me a cloth," she said
to the old man, who was looking at the children with a smile. "why, itâ€™s
not possible that all..."

"but what was it in church on sunday? the priest had been told to read
that. he read it. they didnâ€™t understand a word of it. then they were
told that there was to be a collection for a pious object in church;
well, they pulled out their halfpence and gave them, but what for they
couldnâ€™t say."

"the people cannot help knowi

er and i donâ€™t want to
defend them; but i am speaking of the unanimity in the intellectual
world," said sergey ivanovitch, addressing his brother. levin would have
answered, but the old prince interrupted him.

"well, about that unanimity, thatâ€™s another thing, one may say," said
the prince. "thereâ€™s my son-in-law, stepan arkadyevitch, you know him.
heâ€™s got a place now on the committee of a commission and something or
other, i donâ€™t remember. only thereâ€™s nothing to do in itâ€”why, dolly,
itâ€™s no secret!â€”and a salary of eight thousand. you try asking him
whether his post is of use, heâ€™ll prove to you that itâ€™s most necessary.
and heâ€™s a truthful man too, but thereâ€™s no refusing to believe in the
utility of eight thousand roubles."

"yes, he asked me to give a message to darya alexandrovna about the
post," said sergey ivanovitch reluctantly, feeling the princeâ€™s remark
to be ill-timed.

"so it is with the unanimity of the press. thatâ€™s been explained to me:

"i would only make one condition," pursued the old prince. "alphonse
karr said a capital thing before the war with prussia: â€˜you consider war
to be inevitable? very good. let everyone who advocates war be enrolled
in a special regiment of advance-guards, for the front of every storm,
of every attack, to lead them all!â€™"

"a nice lot the editors would make!" said katavasov, with a loud roar,
as he pictured the editors he knew in this picked legion.

"but theyâ€™d run," said dolly, "theyâ€™d only be in the way."

"oh, if they ran away, then weâ€™d have grape-shot or cossacks with whips
behind them," said the prince.

"but thatâ€™s a joke, and a poor one too, if youâ€™ll excuse my saying so,
prince," said sergey ivanovitch.

"i donâ€™t see that it was a joke, that..." levin was beginning, but
sergey ivanovitch interrupted him.

"every member of society is called upon to do his own special work,"
said he. "and men of thought are doing their work when they express
public op
