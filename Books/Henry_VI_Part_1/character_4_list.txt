Richard Plantagenet  - 
      Although his father once had claims to the throne, the young Richard Plantagenet lost all noble titles when his father was put to death. Plantagenet disagrees with Somerset about a point of law, and they each pick a different color rose as emblems of their opposing viewpoints, Plantagenet choosing the white rose, Somerset the red. Later he asks his imprisoned uncle Mortimer about the reasons for his father's downfall. Plantagenet asks the king to restore his titles, and the King Henry makes him the Duke of York. In France, the argument between Somerset and York is revealed, but the king urges them to make peace. He assigns York to control the English troops in France, where his disagreement with Somerset proves fatal when Somerset delays in sending him reinforcements. York is unable to aid Talbot without these extra troops, and Talbot dies.
