mrs.[CHARACTER]
mrs. das's fundamental failing is that she is profoundly selfish and self-absorbed. she does not see anyone else as they are but rather as a means to fulfilling her own needs and wishes. her romanticized view of mr. kapasi's day job leads her to confide in him, and she is oblivious to the fact that he would rather she did not. she persists in confiding even when it is clear that mr. kapasi has no advice to offer her. mrs. das is selfish, declining to share her food with her children, reluctantly taking her daughter to the bathroom, and refusing to paint her daughter's fingernails. she openly derides her husband and mocks his enthusiasm for tourism, using the fact that they are no longer in love as an excuse for her bad behavior. although mrs. das has been unfaithful, she feels the strain in her marriage only as her own pain. she fails to recognize the toll her affair takes on her husband and children. rather than face the misery she has caused, mrs. das hides behind her sunglasses and disengages from her family. likewise, when her attempt at confiding in mr. kapasi fails, she leaves the car rather than confront the guilt that mr. kapasi has suggested is the source of her pain.

mrs. das embodies stereotypically american flaws, including disrespect for other countries and cultures, poorly behaved children, and a self-involvement so extensive that she blames others for her feelings of guilt about her infidelity. she is messy, lazy, and a bad parent. she has no concern for the environment or her effect on it and drops her rice snacks all over the ground, riling the local wildlife. she represents what is often called the "ugly american," a traveler who stands out in every situation because of her expansive sense of self-importance and entitlement.
