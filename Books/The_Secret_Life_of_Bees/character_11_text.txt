ason. 

i  hadn't  known  this  until  i  was  eight  and  she 
bought me an easter-dyed biddy from the mercantile. i 
found  it  trembling  in  a  corner  of  its  pen,  the  color  of  
purple grapes, with sad little eyes that cast around for its 
mother.  rosaleen  let  me  bring  it  home,  right  into  the 
living  room,  where  i  strewed  a  box  of  quaker  oats  on

the  floor  for  it  to  eat  and  she  didn't  raise  a  word  of  
protest. 

the  chick 

left  dollops  of  violet-streaked 
droppings all over the place, due, i suppose, to the dye 
soaking  into  its  fragile  system.  we  had  just  started  to 
clean them up when t. ray burst in, threatening to boil 
the  chick  for  dinner  and  fire  rosaleen  for  being  an  
imbecile.  he  started  to  swoop  at  the  biddy  with  his  
tractor  grease  hands,  but  rosaleen  planted  herself  in 
front of him. 

"there is worse things in the house than chicken 
shit," she said and looked him up one side and down th

dow, t. ray was coming 
out of the orchard toward the house, fists balled, head 
plowed forward like a bull wanting to gore something. 

i  propped  the  note  on  my  dresser  and  stood  a 
moment in the center of the room, wondering if i'd ever 
see it again. "goodbye," i said, and there was a tiny sprig 
of sadness pushing up from my heart. 

outside, 

i  spied  the  broken  space 

in  the 
latticework that wrapped around the foundation of the 
house. squeezing through, i disappeared into violet light 
and cobwebbed air. 

t. ray's boots stomped across the porch.

"lily!  li-leeeee!"  i  heard  his  voice  sailing  along 

the floorboards of the house. 

all of a sudden i caught sight of snout sniffing at 
the  spot  where  i'd  crawled  through.  i  backed  deeper 
into the darkness, but she'd caught my scent and started 
barking her mangy head off. 

t.  ray  emerged  with  my  note  crumpled  in  his 
hand, yelled at snout to shut the hell up, and tore out in 
his  truck,

how to run a steam heated knife along the super, slicing 
the wax cap off the combs, how to load them just so into 
the  spinner.  i  adjusted  the  flame  under  the  steam 
generator and changed the nylon stockings august used 
to filter the honey in the settling tank. i caught on so fast 
she said i was a marvel. those were her very words: lily, 
you are marvel. 

my favorite thing was pouring beeswax into the 
candle  molds.  august  used  a  pound  of  wax  per  candle 
and pressed tiny violets into them, which i collected in 
the  woods.  she  had  a  mail-order  business  to  stores  in 
places  as  far  away  as  maine  and  vermont.  people  up 
there bought so many of her candles and jars of honey 
she couldn't keep up with it, and there were tins of black 
madonna  all-purpose  beeswax

customers.  august  said  it  could  make  your  fishing  line

crossing the back porch, i heard rosaleen say to 

him, "have you registered yourself to vote?"

on  sunday  i  thought  they  would  go  to  church, 
but no, they held a special service in the pink house, and 
people  came  to  them.  it  was  a  group  called  the  
daughters of mary, which august had organized. 

 

155 

the daughters of mary started showing up in the 
parlor before 10:00 a.m. first was an old woman named 
queenie  and  her  grown  daughter,  violet.  they  were 
dressed  alike in  bright yellow  skirts  and white  blouses, 
though  they  wore  different  hats,  at  least.  next  came 
lunelle,  mabelee,  and  cressie,  who  wore  the  fanciest 
hats i'd ever laid eyes on. 

it turned out lunelle was a hatmaker without the 
least bit of shyness. i'm talking about purple felt the size 
of  a  sombrero  with  fake  fruit  on  the  back.  that  was 
lunelle's. 

mabelee  wore  a  creation  of  tiger  fur  wrapped 
with gold fringe, but it was

august  and  june,  hatless,  gloveless,  earbobless, 
looked  practically  poverty-stricken  next  to  them,  but 
may, good old may, had tied on a  bright blue hat with 
the brim up on one side and down on the other. 

august had brought in chairs and arranged them 
in a semicircle facing the wooden statue of mary. when 
we  were  all seated,  she  lit  the candle and june  played 
the cello. we said the hail marys together, queenie and 
violet  moving  strings  of  wooden  beads  through  their 
fingers. 

august  stood  up and said  she  was  glad me  and 
rosaleen were with them; then she opened a bible and 
read,  "and  mary  said…  behold,  from  henceforth  all 
generations shall call me blessed. for he that is mighty 
hath  done  to  me  great  things…  he  hath  scattered  the 
proud… he hath put down the mighty from their seats, 
and  exalted  them  of  low  degree.  he  hath  filled  the 
hungry  with  good  things;  a

aweed  on  the  ocean  floor.  i  thought  this  was  the 
grand  finale,  but  no,  june  switched  over  to  the  piano 
and banged out a jazzed-up version of "go tell it on the 
mountain." that's when august started a conga-line. she 
danced  over  to  lunelle,  who  latched  on  to  august's 
waist.  cressie  hooked  on  to  lunelle,  followed  by 
mabelee, and  off  they  went around the  room,  causing 
cressie to grab hold of her crimson hat. 

when  they  swung  back  by,  queenie  and  violet 
joined them, then sugar-girl.  i wanted  to be  part of it, 
too,  but  i only watched,  and  so  did rosaleen and otis. 
june seemed to play faster and faster. i fanned my face, 
trying to get a little air, feeling light-headed. when the 
dance  ended,  the  daughters  stood  panting  in  a  half 
circle before our lady of chains, and what they did next

touched the statue's fading red heart.

to death, and then death turns around and gives 
way into life." 

i leaned back in my chair, gazing at the sky, how 
endless  it  was,  the  way  it  fit  down  over  the  world  like 
the lid of a hive. i wished more than anything we could 
bury  may  in  a  beehive  tomb.  that  i  could,  myself,  lie  
down in one and be reborn.

when  the  daughters  of  mary  showed  up,  they 
were  loaded  down  with  food.  the  last  time  i'd  seen 
them,  queenie  and  her  daughter,  violet,  had  on  the 
smallest hats in the group, and this time they'd left them 
off completely. i think it was because queenie hated to 
cover the whiteness of her hair, which she was proud to 
have, and violet, who had to be forty at least, couldn't 
bring herself to wear a hat if her mother wasn't wearing 
one.  if  queenie  went  into  the  kitchen  and  stuck  her 
head in the oven, violet would go stick hers in, too. 

lunelle,  mabelee,  cressie,  and  sugar-girl  each 
wore  a  black  hat,

cello  while  august  retold  black  mary's  story  start  to 
finish.  when  she  got  to  the  part  about  the  slaves 
touching our lady's heart and how she filled them with 
fearlessness  and  plans  of  escape,  june  turned  up  the 
volume. 

"our  lady  became  so  powerful,"  said  august, 
"that  the  master  was  forced  to  put  her  under  house 
arrest, to chain her in the carriage house. she was cast 
down and bound up." 

"the blessed, blessed mother," mumbled violet.

wrapping  them  around  our  lady.  the  way  otis  tossed 
the chain around in the candlelight, i was sure it would 
be a miracle if he didn't kill somebody. august went on. 
"but each time the master chained mary in the carriage 
house,  she  would  break  the  chains  and  return  to  her 
people." 

august  paused.  she went  around  the  circle  and 
looked at us one by one, letting her eyes settle on each 
face like she wasn't

her wig—it was the worst-looking thing you ever saw—
we just didn't like otis giving her orders. 

when all  that  finally  settled  down,  august  said, 

"well, here we are, and here's our lady." 

i looked her over, proud of how clean she was. 
august  read  mary's words from  the bible:  "'for 
behold  from  henceforth  all  generations  shall  call  me 
blessed—"'" 

"blessed mary," violet interrupted. 
"blessed, blessed mary." 
she  stared  at  the  sky,  and  we  all  looked  up,  
wondering  if  she'd  caught  a  glimpse  of  mary  climbing 
through the clouds. "blessed mary," she said one more 
time. 

"today  we're  celebrating  the  assumption  of 
mary,"  august  said.  "we're  celebrating  how  she  woke 
from her sleep and rose into heaven. and we're here to 
remember  the  story  of  our  lady  of  chains,  to  remind 
ourselves that those chains could never keep her do

our lady broke free of them every time." 

august  grabbed  hold  of  the  chain  around  black 
mary  and  unwrapped  a  loop  before  handing  it  off  to 
sugar-girl, who unwrapped it a little further. every one 
of  us  got  to  join  in  taking  off  a  loop  of  chain.  what  i  
remember is the clinking noise it made as it uncoiled in a

is 

"mary 

rising,"  said  august,  her  voice 
concentrated  into  a  whisper.  "she  is  rising  to  her 
heights." the daughters lifted their arms. even otis had 
his arms shot straight up in the air. 

"our  mother  mary  will  not  be  cast  down  and 
bound up," said august. "and neither will her daughters. 
we will rise, daughters. we… will… rise." 

june  sliced  her  bow  across  the  cello  strings.  i 
wanted to lift my arms with

 down  an  aisle  of  rose  petals,  wearing  a  white 
rayon  suit  with  frog  closings  that  mabelee  was  sewing 
for  her.  i  could  not  picture  frog  closings.  june  drew  a 
picture of one on a tablet, and afterward i still could not 
picture them. lunelle had been commissioned to make 
her a wedding hat, which i thought was very courageous 
of  june.  there  was  no  telling  what  she  would  end  up 
with on her head. 

rosaleen  offered  to  bake  the  wedding  cake 
layers, and violet and queenie were going to decorate it 
with a "rainbow theme." 

again, all i can say is how brave june was. 
one  afternoon  i  went  to  the  kitchen  in  the 
middle of the afternoon, nearly dying of thirst, wanting 
to fill a jug with water and take it back to the river, and 
found  june  and  august  clinging  to  each  other  in  the 
middle of the floor. 

i  stood  outside  the  door  and  watched,  even 
though it was a private moment. june gripped august's 
back, and her hands tremble

even as he said it, i could tell he didn't want me, 
didn't  want  me  back  on  the  farm,  didn't  want  to  be 
reminded of her. another part of him—the good part, if 
there was such a thing—might even be thinking that i'd 
be better off here. 

it  was  pride  now,  all  pride.  how  could  he  back

the  front  door  opened,  and  queenie,  violet, 
lunelle,  and  mabelee  stumbled  into  the  house,  all 
wound  up  and  looking  like  they  had  their  clothes  on 
backward. queenie stared at my cheek. 

"everybody all right?" she said, out of breath. 
"we're all right," said august. "this is mr. owens, 

lily's father. he came for a visit."

muttering,  "blessed  mary,"  and  queenie—tough  old 
queenie—with her hands on her hips and her lip shoved 
out, every inch of her saying, i double-dog dare you to 
take this girl. 

t. ray sniffed hard and looked at the ceiling. his 
resolve  was  crumbling  all  around  him.  you  could 
practically see bits of it flaking off.

in the autumn south carolina changed her color 
to  ruby  red  and  wild  shades  of  orange.  i  watch  them 
now from my upstairs room, the room june left behind 
when  she  got  married  last  month.  i  could  not  have 
dreamed such a room. august bought me a new bed and 
a dressing table, white french provincial from the sears 
and  roebuck  catalog.  violet  and  queenie  donated  a 
flowered rug that had been laying around in their extra 
room  going  to  waste,  and  mabelee  sewed  blue-and-
white  polka  dot  curtains  for  the  windows  with  fringe 
balls along the hem. cressie crocheted four eight-legged 
octopuses out of various colors of yarn to sit on the bed. 
one  octopus  would  have  been  enough  for  me,  but  it's 
the only handicraft cressie knows how to do, so she just 
keeps doing it. 

lunelle created me a hat that outdid ever
