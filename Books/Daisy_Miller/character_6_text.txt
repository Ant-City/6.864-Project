by this time daisy had turned her attention again to winterbourne. â€œiâ€™ve been telling mrs. walker how mean you were!â€ the young girl announced.
â€œand what is the evidence you have offered?â€ asked winterbourne, rather annoyed at miss millerâ€™s want of appreciation of the zeal of an admirer who on his way down to rome had stopped neither at bologna nor at florence, simply because of a certain sentimental impatience. he remembered that a cynical compatriot had once told him that american womenâ€”the pretty ones, and this gave a largeness to the axiomâ€”were at once the most exacting in t

â€œwhy, you were awfully mean at vevey,â€ said daisy. â€œyou wouldnâ€™t do anything. you wouldnâ€™t stay there when i asked you.â€
â€œmy dearest young lady,â€ cried winterbourne, with eloquence, â€œhave i come all the way to rome to encounter your reproaches?â€
â€œjust hear him say that!â€ said daisy to her hostess, giving a twist to a bow on this ladyâ€™s dress. â€œdid you ever hear anything so quaint?â€
â€œso quaint, my dear?â€ murmured mrs. walker in the tone of a partisan of winterbourne.
â€œwell, i donâ€™t know,â€ said daisy, fingering mrs. walkerâ€™s ribbons. â€œmrs. walker, i want to tell you something.â€
â€œmother-r,â€ interposed randolph, with his rough ends to his words, â€œi tell you youâ€™ve got to go. eugenioâ€™ll raiseâ€”something!â€
â€œiâ€™m not afraid of eugenio,â€ said daisy with a toss of her head. â€œlook here, mrs. walker,â€ she went on, â€œyou know iâ€™m coming to your party.â€
â€œi am delighted to hear it.â€

â€œi shall be happy to see any of your friends,â€ said mrs. walker, turning with a smile to mrs. miller.
â€œoh, they are not my friends,â€ answered daisyâ€™s mamma, smiling shyly in her own fashion. â€œi never spoke to them.â€
â€œitâ€™s an intimate friend of mineâ€”mr. giovanelli,â€ said daisy without a tremor in her clear little voice or a shadow on her brilliant little face.
mrs. walker was silent a moment; she gave a rapid glance at winterbourne. â€œi shall be glad to see mr. giovanelli,â€ she then said.

it was settled that this brilliant personage should be brought to mrs. walkerâ€™s party, and then mrs. miller prepared to take her leave. â€œi guess weâ€™ll go back to the hotel,â€ she said.
â€œyou may go back to the hotel, mother, but iâ€™m going to take a walk,â€ said daisy.
â€œsheâ€™s going to walk with mr. giovanelli,â€ randolph proclaimed.
â€œi am going to the pincio,â€ said daisy, smiling.
â€œalone, my dearâ€”at this hour?â€ mrs. walker asked. the afternoon was drawing to a closeâ€”it was the hour for the throng of carriages and of contemplative pedestrians. â

â€œneither do i,â€ subjoined mrs. miller. â€œyouâ€™ll get the fever, as sure as you live. remember what dr. davis told you!â€
â€œgive her some medicine before she goes,â€ said randolph.
the company had risen to its feet; daisy, still showing her pretty teeth, bent over and kissed her hostess. â€œmrs. walker, you are too perfect,â€ she said. â€œiâ€™m not going alone; i am going to meet a friend.â€
â€œyour friend wonâ€™t keep you from getting the fever,â€ mrs. miller observed.
â€œis it mr. giovanelli?â€ asked the hostess.
winterbourne was watching the young girl; at this question his attention quickened. she stood there, smiling and smoothing her bonnet ribbons; she glanced at winterbourne. then, while she glanced and smiled, she answered, without a shade of hesitation, â€œmr. giovanelliâ€”the b

â€œwell, he speaks english,â€ said mrs. miller.
â€œgracious me!â€ daisy exclaimed, â€œi donâ€™t to do anything improper. thereâ€™s an easy way to settle it.â€ she continued to glance at winterbourne. â€œthe pincio is only a hundred yards distant; and if mr. winterbourne were as polite as he pretends, he would offer to walk with me!â€

im gracious leave to accompany her. they passed downstairs before her mother, and at the door winterbourne perceived mrs. millerâ€™s carriage drawn up, with the ornamental courier whose acquaintance he had made at vevey seated within. â€œgoodbye, eugenio!â€ cried daisy; â€œiâ€™m going to take a walk.â€ the distance from the via gregoriana to the beautiful garden at the other end of the pincian hill is, in fact, rapidly traversed. as the day was splendid, however, and the concourse of vehicles, walkers, and loungers numerous, the young americans found their progress much delayed. this fact was highly agreeable to winterbourne, in spite of his consciousness of his singular situation. the slow-moving, idly gazing roman crowd bestowed much attention upon the extremely pretty young foreign lady who was passing through it upon his arm; and he wondered what on earth had been in daisyâ€™s mind when she proposed to expose herself, unattended, to its appreciation. his own mission, to her sense, appar

 was to consign her to the hands of mr. giovanelli; but winterbourne, at once annoyed and gratified, resolved that he would do no such thing.
â€œwhy havenâ€™t you been to see me?â€ asked daisy. â€œyou canâ€™t get out of that.â€
â€œi have had the honor of telling you that i have only just stepped out of the train.â€
â€œyou must have stayed in the train a good while after it stopped!â€ cried the young girl with her little laugh. â€œi suppose you were asleep. you have had time to go to see mrs. walker.â€
â€œi knew mrs. walkerâ€”â€ winterbourne began to explain.
â€œi know where you knew her. you knew her at geneva. she told me so. well, you knew me at vevey. thatâ€™s just as good. so you ought to have come.â€ she asked him no other question than this; she began to prattle about her own affairs. â€œweâ€™ve got splendid rooms at the hotel; eugenio says theyâ€™re the best rooms in rome. we are going to stay all winter, if we donâ€™t die of the fever; and i guess weâ€™ll stay then. itâ€™s a gr

â€œi certainly shall not help you to find him,â€ winterbourne declared.
â€œthen i shall find him without you,â€ cried miss daisy.

she burst into her little laugh. â€œare you afraid youâ€™ll get

d make her much less perplexing. but daisy, on this occasion, continued to present herself as an inscrutable combination of audacity and innocence.
she had been walking some quarter of an hour, attended by her two cavaliers, and responding in a tone of very childish gaiety, as it seemed to winterbourne, to the pretty speeches of mr. giovanelli, when a carriage that had detached itself from the revolving train drew up beside the path. at the same moment winterbourne perceived that his friend mrs. walkerâ€”the lady whose house he had lately leftâ€”was seated in the vehicle and was beckoning to him. leaving miss millerâ€™s side, he hastened to obey her summons. mrs. walker was flushed; she wore an excited air. â€œit is really too dreadful,â€ she said. â€œthat girl must not do this sort of thing. she must not walk here with you two men. fifty people have noticed her.â€
winterbourne raised his eyebrows. â€œi think itâ€™s a pity to make too much fuss about it.â€
â€œitâ€™s a pity to let the girl

â€œshe is very innocent,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œsheâ€™s very crazy!â€ cried mrs. walker. â€œdid you ever see anything so imbecile as her mother? after you had all left me just now, i could not sit still for thinking of it. it seemed too pitiful, not even to attempt to save her. i ordered the carriage and put on my bonnet, and came here as quickly as possible. thank heaven i have found you!â€

â€œi donâ€™t think itâ€™s a very happy thought,â€ said winterbourne; â€œbut you can try.â€
mrs. walker tried. the young man went in pursuit of miss miller, who had simply nodded and smiled at his interlocutor in the carriage and had gone her way with her companion. daisy, on learning that mrs. walker wished to speak to her, retraced her steps with a perfect good grace and with mr. giovanelli at her side. she declared that she was delighted to have a chance to present this gentleman to mrs. walker. she immediately achieved the introduction, and declared that she had never in her life seen anything so lovely as mrs. walkerâ€™s carriage rug.
â€œi am glad you admire it,â€ said this lady, smiling sweetly. â€œwill you get in and let me put it over you?â€
â€œoh, no, thank you,â€ said daisy. â€œ

â€œthat would be charming, but itâ€™s so enchanting just as i am!â€ and daisy gave a brilliant glance at the gentlemen on either side of her.
â€œit may be enchanting, dear child, but it is not the custom here,â€ urged mrs. walker, leaning forward in her victoria, with her hands devoutly clasped.
â€œwell, it ought to be, then!â€ said daisy. â€œif i didnâ€™t walk i should expire.â€
â€œyou should walk with your mother, dear,â€ cried the lady from geneva, losing patience.
â€œwith my mother dear!â€ exclaimed the young girl. winterbourne saw that she scented interference. â€œmy mother never walked ten steps in her life. and then, you know,â€ she added with a laugh, â€œi am more than five years old.â€

daisy looked at mrs. walker, smiling intensely. â€œtalked about? what do you mean?â€
â€œcome into my carriage, and i will tell you.â€
daisy turned her quickened glance again from one of the gentlemen beside her to the other. mr. giovanelli was bowing to and fro, rubbing down his gloves and laughing very agreeably; winterbourne thought it a most unpleasant scene. â€œi donâ€™t think i want to know what you mean,â€ said daisy presently. â€œi donâ€™t think i should like it.â€
winterbourne wished that mrs. walker would tuc

winterbourne colored; for an instant he hesitated greatly. it seemed so strange to hear her speak that way of her â€œreputation.â€ but he himself, in fact, must speak in accordance with gallantry. the finest gallantry, here, was simply to tell her the truth; and the truth, for winterbourne, as the few indications i have been able to give have made him known to the reader, was that daisy miller should take mrs. walkerâ€™s advice. he looked at her exquisite prettiness, and then he said, very gently, â€œi think you should get into the carriage.â€
daisy gave a violent laugh. â€œi never heard anything so stiff! if this is improper, mrs. walker,â€ she pursued, â€œthen i am all improper, and you must give me up. goodbye; i hope youâ€™ll have a lovely ride!â€ and, with mr. giovanelli, who made a triumphantly obsequious salute, she turned away.
mrs. walker sat looking after her, and there were tears in mrs. walke

râ€™s eyes. â€œget in here, sir,â€ she said to winterbourne, indicating the place beside her. the young man answered that he felt bound to accompany miss miller, whereupon mrs. walker declared that if he refused her this favor she would never speak to him again. she was evidently in earnest. winterbourne overtook daisy and her companion, and, offering the young girl his hand, told her that mrs. walker had made an imperious claim upon his society. he expected that in answer she would say something rather free, something to commit herself still further to that â€œrecklessnessâ€ from which mrs. walker had so charitably endeavored to dissuade her. but she only shook his hand, hardly looking at him, while mr. giovanelli bade him farewell with a too emphatic flourish of the hat.
winterbourne was not in the best possible humor as he took his seat in mrs. walkerâ€™s victoria. â€œthat was not clever

â€œin such a case,â€ his companion answered, â€œi donâ€™t wish to be clever; i wish to be earnest!â€
â€œwell, your earnestness has only offended her and put her off.â€
â€œit has happened very well,â€ said mrs. walker. â€œif she is so perfectly determined to compromise herself, the sooner one knows it the better; one can act accordingly.â€
â€œi suspect she meant no harm,â€ winterbourne rejoined.
â€œso i thought a month ago. but she has been going too far.â€
â€œwhat has she been doing?â€
â€œeverything that is not done here. flirting with any man she could pick up; sitting in corners with mysterious italians; dancing all the evening with the same partners; receiving visits at eleven oâ€™clock at night. her

â€œbut her brother,â€ said winterbourne, laughing, â€œsits up till midnight.â€
â€œhe must be edified by what he sees. iâ€™m told that at their hotel everyone is talking about her, and that a smile goes round among all the servants when a gentleman comes and asks for miss miller.â€
â€œthe servants be hanged!â€ said winterbourne angrily. â€œthe poor girlâ€™s only fault,â€ he presently added, â€œis that she is very uncultivated.â€
â€œshe is naturally indelicate,â€ mrs. walker declared.
â€œtake that example this morning. how long had you known her at vevey?â€
â€œa couple of days.â€
â€œfancy, then, her making it a personal matter that you should have left the place!â€
winterbourne was silent for some moments; then he said, â€œi suspect, mrs. walker, that you and i have lived too long at geneva!â€ and he added a request that she should inform him with what particular design she had made him enter her carriage.
â€œi wished to beg you to cease your relations with mis

s millerâ€”not to flirt with herâ€”to give her no further opportunity to expose herselfâ€”to let her alone, in short.â€
â€œiâ€™m afraid i canâ€™t do that,â€ said winterbourne. â€œi like her extremely.â€
â€œall the more reason that you shouldnâ€™t help her to make a scandal.â€
â€œthere shall be nothing scandalous in my attentions to her.â€
â€œthere certainly will be in the way she takes them. but i have said what i had on my conscience,â€ mrs. walker pursued. â€œif you wish to rejoin the young lady i will put you down. here, by the way, you have a chance.â€
the carriage was traversing that part of the pincian garden that overhangs the wall of rome and overlooks the beautiful villa borghese. it is bordered by a large parapet, near which there are several seats. one of the seats at a distance was occupied by a gentleman and a lady, toward whom mrs. walker gave a toss of her head. at the same moment these persons rose and walked toward the pa

s were hidden from winterbourne. this young man lingered a moment, then he began to walk. but he walkedâ€”not toward the couple with the parasol; toward the residence of his aunt, mrs. costello.
he flattered himself on the following day that there was no smiling among the servants when he, at least, asked for mrs. miller at her hotel. this lady and her daughter, however, were not at home; and on the next day after, repeating his visit, winterbourne again had the misfortune not to find them. mrs. walkerâ€™s party took place on the evening of the third day, and, in spite of the frigidity of his last interview with the hostess, winterbourne was among the guests. mrs. walker was one of those american ladies who, while residing abroad, make a point, in their own phrase, of studying european society, and she had on this occasion collected several specimens of her diversely born fellow mortals to serve, as it were, as textbooks. when winterbourne arrived, daisy miller was not there, but in a few mom

â€œiâ€™m sorry she should come in that way,â€ said mrs. walker.
â€œwell, i told her that there was no use in her getting dressed before dinner if she was going to wait three hours,â€ responded daisyâ€™s mamma. â€œi didnâ€™t see the use of her putting on such a dress as that to sit round with mr. giovanelli.â€

â€œi think every one knows you!â€ said mrs. walker pregnantly, and she gave a very cursory greeting to mr. giovanelli. this gentleman bore himself gallantly. he smiled and bowed and showed his white teeth; he curled his mustaches and rolled his eyes and performed all the proper functions of a handsome italian at an evening party. he sang very prettily half a dozen songs, though mrs. walker afterward declared that she had been quite unable to find out who asked him. it was apparently not daisy who had given him his orders. daisy sat at a distanc

â€œitâ€™s a pity these rooms are so small; we canâ€™t dance,â€ she said to winterbourne, as if she had seen him five minutes before.
â€œi am not sorry we canâ€™t dance,â€ winterbourne answered; â€œi donâ€™t dance.â€
â€œof course you donâ€™t dance; youâ€™re too stiff,â€ said miss daisy. â€œi hope you enjoyed your drive with mrs. walker!â€
â€œno. i didnâ€™t enjoy it; i preferred walking with you.â€
â€œwe paired off: that was much better,â€ said daisy. â€œbut did you ever hear anything so cool as mrs. walkerâ€™s wanting me to get into her carriage and drop poor mr. giovanelli, and under the pretext that it was proper? people have different ideas! it would have been most unkind; he had been talking about that walk for ten days.â€
â€œhe should not have talked about it at all,â€ said winterbourne; â€œhe would never have propo

â€œi have offered you advice,â€ winterbourne rejoined.
â€œi prefer weak tea!â€ cried daisy, and she went off with the brilliant giovanelli. she sat with him in the adjoining room, in the embrasure of the window, for the rest of the evening. there was an interesting performance at the piano, but neither of these young people gave heed to it. when daisy came to take leave of mrs. walker, this lady conscientiously repaired the weakness of which she had been guilty at the moment of the young girlâ€™s arrival. she turned her back straight upon miss miller and left her to depart with what grace she might. winterbourne was standing near the door; he saw it all. daisy turned very pale and looked at her mother, but mrs. miller was humbly unconscious of any violation of the usual social forms. she appeared, indeed, to have felt an incongruous impulse to draw attention to her own strik

ing observance of them. â€œgood night, mrs. walker,â€ she said; â€œweâ€™ve had a beautiful evening. you see, if i let daisy come to parties without me, i donâ€™t want her to go away without me.â€ daisy turned away, looking with a pale, grave face at the circle near the door; winterbourne saw that, for the first moment, she was too much shocked and puzzled even for indignation. he on his side was greatly touched.
â€œthat was very cruel,â€ he said to mrs. walker.
â€œshe never enters my drawing room again!â€ replied his hostess.
since winterbourne was not to meet her in mrs. walkerâ€™s drawing room, he went as often as possible to mrs. millerâ€™s hotel. the ladies were rarely at home, but when he found them, the devoted giovanelli was always present. very often the brilliant little roman was in the drawing room with daisy alone, mrs. miller being apparently constantly of the opinion that discretion is the better part of surveillance. winterbourne noted

ller. it must be added that this sentiment was not altogether flattering to daisy; it was part of his conviction, or rather of his apprehension, that she would prove a very light young person.
but she was evidently very much interested in giovanelli. she looked at him whenever he spoke; she was perpetually telling him to do this and to do that; she was constantly â€œchaffingâ€ and abusing him. she appeared completely to have forgotten that winterbourne had said anything to displease her at mrs. walkerâ€™s little party. one sunday afternoon, having gone to st. peterâ€™s with his aunt, winterbourne perceived daisy strolling about the great church in company with the inevitable giovanelli. presently he pointed out the young girl and her cavalier to mrs. costello. this lady looked at them a moment through her eyeglass, and then she said:
â€œthatâ€™s what makes you so pensive in these days, eh?â€
â€œi had not the least idea i was pensive,â€ said the young man.
â€œyou are very much preoccupied;

â€œi have noticed you. but i noticed you were as stiff as an umbrella the first time i saw you.â€
â€œyou will find i am not so stiff as several others,â€ said winterbourne, smiling.
â€œhow shall i find it?â€
â€œby going to see the others.â€
â€œwhat will they do to me?â€
â€œthey will give you the cold shoulder. do you know what that means?â€
daisy was looking at him intently; she began to color. â€œdo you mean as mrs. walker did the other night?â€
â€œexactly!â€ said winterbourne.
she looked away at giovanelli, who was decorating himself with his almond blossom. then looking back at winterbourne, â€œi shouldnâ€™t think you would let people be so unkind!â€ she said.
â€œhow can i help it?â€ he asked.
â€œi should think you would say something.â€
â€œi do say something;â€ and he paused a moment. â€œi say that your mother tells me that she believes you are engaged.â€
â€œwell, she does,â€ said daisy very simply.
