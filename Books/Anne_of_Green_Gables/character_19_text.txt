ed hill beyond. since avonlea occupied a little triangular
peninsula jutting out into the gulf of st. lawrence with water on two
sides of it, anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that
hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of mrs. rachel’s all-seeing
eye.

she was sitting there one afternoon in early june. the sun was coming in
at the window warm and bright; the orchard on the slope below the house
was in a bridal flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of
bees. thomas lynde--a meek little man whom avonlea people called “rachel
lynde’s husband”--was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field
beyond the barn; and matthew cuthbert ought to have been sowing his on
the big red brook field away over by green gables. mrs. rachel knew
that he ought because she had heard him tell peter morrison the evening
before in william j. blair’s store over at carmody that he meant to sow
his turnip seed the next afternoon. peter had asked him, of course, for

that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but i’ve never been
able to believe it. i don’t believe a rose _would_ be as nice if it was
called a thistle or a skunk cabbage. i suppose my father could have been
a good man even if he had been called jedediah; but i’m sure it would
have been a cross. well, my mother was a teacher in the high school,
too, but when she married father she gave up teaching, of course. a
husband was enough responsibility. mrs. thomas said that they were
a pair of babies and as poor as church mice. they went to live in a
weeny-teeny little yellow house in bolingbroke. i’ve never seen that
house, but i’ve imagined it thousands of times. i think it must have
had honeysuckle over the parlor window and lilacs in the front yard and
lilies of the valley just inside the gate. yes, and muslin curtains in
all the windows. muslin curtains give a house such an air. i was born
in that house. mrs. thomas said i was the homeliest baby

was satisfied with me anyhow, i would feel so sad if i thought i was a
disappointment to her--because she didn’t live very long after that, you
see. she died of fever when i was just three months old. i do wish she’d
lived long enough for me to remember calling her mother. i think it
would be so sweet to say ‘mother,’ don’t you? and father died four days
afterwards from fever too. that left me an orphan and folks were at
their wits’ end, so mrs. thomas said, what to do with me. you see,
nobody wanted me even then. it seems to be my fate. father and mother
had both come from places far away and it was well known they hadn’t any
relatives living. finally mrs. thomas said she’d take me, though she was
poor and had a drunken husband. she brought me up by hand. do you know
if there is anything in being brought up by hand that ought to make
people who are brought up that way better than other people? because

“mr. and mrs. thomas moved away from bolingbroke to marysville, and i
lived with them until i was eight years old. i helped look after the
thomas children--there were four of them younger than me--and i can tell
you they took a lot of looking after. then mr. thomas was killed
falling under a train and his mother offered to take mrs. thomas and the
children, but she didn’t want me. mrs. thomas was at _her_ wits’ end, so
she said, what to do with me. then mrs. hammond from up the river came
down and said she’d take me, seeing i was handy with children, and
i went up the river to live with her in a little clearing among the
stumps. it was a very lonesome place. i’m sure i could never have
lived there if i hadn’t had an imagination. mr. hammond worked a little
sawmill up there, and mrs. hammond had eight children. she had twins
three times. i like babies in moderation, but twins

“were those women--mrs. thomas and mrs. hammond--good to you?” asked
marilla, looking at anne out of the corner of her eye.

“o-o-o-h,” faltered anne. her sensitive little face suddenly flushed
scarlet and embarrassment sat on her brow. “oh, they _meant_ to be--i know
they meant to be just as good and kind as possible. and when people
mean to be good to you, you don’t mind very much when they’re not

, so near the track in places that a mare of less steadiness than
the sorrel might have tried the nerves of the people behind her. down
at the base of the cliffs were heaps of surf-worn rocks or little sandy
coves inlaid with pebbles as with ocean jewels; beyond lay the sea,
shimmering and blue, and over it soared the gulls, their pinions
flashing silvery in the sunlight.

“isn’t the sea wonderful?” said anne, rousing from a long, wide-eyed
silence. “once, when i lived in marysville, mr. thomas hired an express
wagon and took us all to spend the day at the shore ten miles away.
i enjoyed every moment of that day, even if i had to look after the
children all the time. i lived it over in happy dreams for years.
but this shore is nicer than the marysville shore. aren’t those gulls
splendid? would you like to be a gull? i think i would--that is, if i
couldn’t be a human girl. don’t you think it would be nice to wake up at
sunrise and swoop down over the water and away out over that

ke a big organ playing. you couldn’t quite
call it poetry, i suppose, but it sounds a lot like it, doesn’t it?”

“we’re not talking about poetry, anne--we are talking about saying your
prayers. don’t you know it’s a terrible wicked thing not to say your
prayers every night? i’m afraid you are a very bad little girl.”

“you’d find it easier to be bad than good if you had red hair,” said
anne reproachfully. “people who haven’t red hair don’t know what trouble
is. mrs. thomas told me that god made my hair red _on purpose_, and i’ve
never cared about him since. and anyhow i’d always be too tired at night
to bother saying prayers. people who have to look after twins can’t be
expected to say their prayers. now, do you honestly think they can?”

marilla decided that anne’s religious training must be begun at once.
plainly there was no time to be lost.

“you must say your prayers while you are under my roof, anne.”

“why, of course, if you want me to,”

grateful. why, child, whatever is the matter?”

“i’m crying,” said anne in a tone of bewilderment. “i can’t think why.
i’m glad as glad can be. oh, _glad_ doesn’t seem the right word at all. i
was glad about the white way and the cherry blossoms--but this! oh, it’s
something more than glad. i’m so happy. i’ll try to be so good. it
will be uphill work, i expect, for mrs. thomas often told me i was
desperately wicked. however, i’ll do my very best. but can you tell me
why i’m crying?”

“i suppose it’s because you’re all excited and worked up,” said marilla
disapprovingly. “sit down on that chair and try to calm yourself. i’m
afraid you both cry and laugh far too easily. yes, you can stay here and
we will try to do right by you. you must go to school; but it’s only a

marilla was as fond of morals as the duchess in wonderland, and was
firmly convinced that one should be tacked on to every remark made to a
child who was being brought up.

but anne waved the moral inconsequently aside and seized only on the
delightful possibilities before it.

“oh, i’m so glad she’s pretty. next to being beautiful oneself--and
that’s impossible in my case--it would be best to have a beautiful bosom
friend. when i lived with mrs. thomas she had a bookcase in her sitting
room with glass doors. there weren’t any books in it; mrs. thomas kept
her best china and her preserves there--when she had any preserves to
keep. one of the doors was broken. mr. thomas smashed it one night
when he was slightly intoxicated. but the other was whole and i used to
pretend that my reflection in it was another little girl who lived in
it. i called her katie maurice, and we were very intimate. i used to
talk to her by the hour, especially on sunda

katie was the comfort and consolation of my life. we used to pretend
that the bookcase was enchanted and that if i only knew the spell i
could open the door and step right into the room where katie maurice
lived, instead of into mrs. thomas’ shelves of preserves and china. and
then katie maurice would have taken me by the hand and led me out into a
wonderful place, all flowers and sunshine and fairies, and we would have
lived there happy for ever after. when i went to live with mrs. hammond
it just broke my heart to leave katie maurice. she felt it dreadfully,
too, i know she did, for she was crying when she kissed me good-bye
through the bookcase door. there was no bookcase at mrs. hammond’s. but

blazing, hands clenched, passionate indignation exhaling from her like
an atmosphere.

“how dare you say such things about me?” she repeated vehemently. “how
would you like to have such things said about you? how would you like
to be told that you are fat and clumsy and probably hadn’t a spark of
imagination in you? i don’t care if i do hurt your feelings by saying
so! i hope i hurt them. you have hurt mine worse than they were ever
hurt before even by mrs. thomas’ intoxicated husband. and i’ll _never_
forgive you for it, never, never!”

“did anybody ever see such a temper!” exclaimed the horrified mrs.
rachel.

“anne go to your room and stay there until i come up,” said marilla,
recovering her powers of speech with difficulty.

tins on the porch wall outside rattled in sympathy, and fled through the
hall and up the stairs like a whirlwind. a subdued sla

diana play with me again. oh, marilla, i’m just overcome with woe.”

marilla stared in blank amazement.

“set diana drunk!” she said when she found her voice. “anne are you or
mrs. barry crazy? what on earth did you give her?”

“not a thing but raspberry cordial,” sobbed anne. “i never thought
raspberry cordial would set people drunk, marilla--not even if they
drank three big tumblerfuls as diana did. oh, it sounds so--so--like
mrs. thomas’s husband! but i didn’t mean to set her drunk.”

“drunk fiddlesticks!” said marilla, marching to the sitting room pantry.
there on the shelf was a bottle which she at once recognized as one
containing some of her three-year-old homemade currant wine for which
she was celebrated in avonlea, although certain of the stricter sort,
mrs. barry among them, disapproved strongly of it. and at the same time
marilla recollected that she had put the bottle of raspberry cordial

walk.”

“there are no such things as ghosts, anne.”

“oh, but there are, marilla,” cried anne eagerly. “i know people who
have seen them. and they are respectable people. charlie sloane says
that his grandmother saw his grandfather driving home the cows one night
after he’d been buried for a year. you know charlie sloane’s grandmother
wouldn’t tell a story for anything. she’s a very religious woman. and
mrs. thomas’s father was pursued home one night by a lamb of fire with
its head cut off hanging by a strip of skin. he said he knew it was the
spirit of his brother and that it was a warning he would die within nine
days. he didn’t, but he died two years after, so you see it was really
true. and ruby gillis says--”

“anne shirley,” interrupted marilla firmly, “i never want to hear you
talking in this fashion again. i’ve had my doubts about that imagination
of yours right along, and if this is

“she is,” said marilla, “and she’s real steady and reliable now. i used

and i wouldn’t be afraid to trust her in anything now.”

“i never would have thought she’d have turned out so well that first day
i was here three years ago,” said mrs. rachel. “lawful heart, shall i
ever forget that tantrum of hers! when i went home that night i says to
thomas, says i, ‘mark my words, thomas, marilla cuthbert ‘ll live to

ain’t one of those kind of people, marilla, as can never be brought to
own up that they’ve made a mistake. no, that never was my way, thank
goodness. i did make a mistake in judging anne, but it weren’t no
wonder, for an odder, unexpecteder witch of a child there never was in

that worked with other children. it

that they accept yours. he said he was going to teach at white sands. of
course he knew how much you wanted to stay with marilla, and i must
say i think it was real kind and thoughtful in him, that’s what. real
self-sacrificing, too, for he’ll have his board to pay at white sands,
and everybody knows he’s got to earn his own way through college. so the
trustees decided to take you. i was tickled to death when thomas came
home and told me.”

“i don’t feel that i ought to take it,” murmured anne. “i mean--i don’t
think i ought to let gilbert make such a sacrifice for--for me.”

“i guess you can’t prevent him now. he’s signed papers with the white
sands trustees. so it wouldn’t do him any good now if you were to
refuse. of course you’ll take the school. you’ll get along all right,
now that there are no pyes going. josie was the last of them, and a
good thing she was, that’s what. t

stom. excuse me while i run over and see what she wants.”

anne ran down the clover slope like a deer, and disappeared in the firry
shadows of the haunted wood. mrs. lynde looked after her indulgently.

“there’s a good deal of the child about her yet in some ways.”

“there’s a good deal more of the woman about her in others,” retorted
marilla, with a momentary return of her old crispness.

but crispness was no longer marilla’s distinguishing characteristic. as
mrs. lynde told her thomas that night.

“marilla cuthbert has got _mellow_. that’s what.”

anne went to the little avonlea graveyard the next evening to put fresh
flowers on matthew’s grave and water the scotch rosebush. she lingered
there until dusk, liking the peace and calm of the little place,
with its poplars whose rustle was like low, friendly speech, and its
whispering grasses growing at will among the graves. when she finally
left it and walked down the long hill that sloped to the lake of shining
