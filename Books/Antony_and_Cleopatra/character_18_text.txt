by the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
my very heart at root.

cleopatra.
i thank you, sir.
know you what caesar means to do with me?

dolabella.
i am loath to tell you what i would you knew.

cleopatra.
nay, pray you, sir,--

dolabella.
though he be honourable,--

cleopatra.
he'll lead me, then, in triumph?

dolabella.
madam, he will;
i know it.

sir, the gods

take to you no hard thoughts;
the record of what injuries you did us,
though written in our flesh, we shall remember
as things but done by chance.

your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall
hang in what place you please. here, my good lord.

caesar.
you shall advise me in all for cleopatra.

cleopatra.
this is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,
i am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;
not petty things admitted.--where's seleucus?

seleucus.
here, madam.

cleopatra.
this is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,
upon his peril, that i have reserv'd
to myself nothing. speak the truth, seleucus.

seleucus.
madam,
i had rather seal my lips than to my peril
speak that which is not.

cleopatra.
what have i kept back?

seleucus.
enough to purchase what you have made known.

caesar.
nay, blush not, cleopatra; i approve
your wisdom in the deed.

cleopatra.
see, caesar! o, behold,
how pomp is follow'd!

good queen, let us entreat you.

ion of his envy! say, good caesar,
that i some lady trifles have reserv'd,
immoment toys, things of such dignity
as we greet modern friends withal; and say,
some nobler token i have kept apart
for livia and octavia, to induce
their mediation;--must i be unfolded
with one that i have bred? the gods! it smites me
