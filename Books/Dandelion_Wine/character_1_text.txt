she exchanged money for pieces of the original ice age. the children thanked her with 
snow in their mouths, their eyes darting from her buttoned-up shoes to her white hair. 

"don't you want a bite?" said the boy. 

"no, child. i'm old enough and cold enough; the hottest day won't thaw me," laughed 
mrs. bentley.

"i'm alice, she's jane, and that's tom spaulding." 
"how nice. and i'm mrs. bentley. they called me helen."

mrs. bentley laughed dryly. 

"you never hear them used, he means," said jane.

like an excursion boat, wonderfully easy to steer, a baton handle you twitched with 
your hand, so. 

oh, that glorious and enchanted first week— the magical afternoons of golden light, 
humming through the shady town on a dreaming, timeless river, seated stiffly, smiling at 
passing acquaintances, sedately purring out their wrinkled claws at every turn, squeezing 
a hoarse cry from the black rubber horn at intersections, sometimes letting douglas or 
tom spaulding or any of the other boys who trotted, chatting, alongside, hitch a little 
ride. fifteen slow and pleasurable miles an hour top speed. they came and went through 
the summer sunlight and shadow, their faces freckled and stained by passing trees, 
going and coming like an ancient, wheeled vision. 

"and then," whispered fern, "this afternoon! oh, this afternoon!" 

"it was an accident."

elmira stared at a bruise on her arm, carefully tongued a loose tooth in her jaw. 

a door slammed. tom spaulding, kneeling on elmira brown's front lawn, looked up. he 
had been wandering about the neighborhood, seeing how the ants were doing here or 
there, and had found a particularly good hill with a big hole in which all kinds of fiery 
bright pismires were tumbling about scissoring the air and wildly carrying little packets of 
dead grasshopper and infinitesimal bird down into the earth. now here was something 
else: mrs. brown, swaying on the edge of her porch as if she'd just found out the world

"a good night's sleep, or a ten-minute bawl, or a pint of chocolate ice cream, or all

"shut up, you guys," said charlie. "we're almost there!" 

they turned a corner. 

deep in winter they had looked for bits and pieces of summer and found it in furnace 
cellars or in bonfires on the edge of frozen skating ponds at night. now, in summer, they 
went searching for some little bit, some piece of the forgotten winter. 

rounding the corner, they felt a continual light rain spray down from a vast brick 
building to refresh them as they read the sign they knew by heart, the
