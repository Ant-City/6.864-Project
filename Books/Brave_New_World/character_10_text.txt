 velveteen shorts! do you know, 
dear, i've still got my old clothes, the ones i came in, put away in a 
box. i'll show them you afterwards. though, of course, the acetate has 
all gone into holes. but such a lovely white bandolier-though i must 
say your green morocco is even lovelier. not that it did me much good, 
that bandolier." her tears began to flow again. "i suppose john told 
you. what i had to suffer-and not a gramme of soma to be had. only 
a drink of mescal every now and then, when pope used to bring it. 
pope is a boy i used to know. but it makes you feel so bad afterwards, 
the mescal does, and you're sick with the peyotl; besides it always 
made that awful feeling of being ashamed much worse the next day. 
and i was so ashamed. just think of it: me, a beta-having a baby: put 
yourself in my place." (the mere suggestion made lenina shudder.) 
"though it wasn't my fault, i swear; because i still don't know how it 
happened, seeing that i did all the malthusian drill-you know,

or bottles, or decanting, or anything of that sort. so they're having 
children all the time-like dogs. it's too revolting. and to think that i ... 
oh, ford, ford, ford! and yet john was a great comfort to me. i don't 
know what i should have done without him. even though he did get so 
upset whenever a man ... quite as a tiny boy, even. once (but that was 
when he was bigger) he tried to kill poor waihusiwa-or was it pope?- 
just because i used to have them sometimes. because i never could 
make him understand that that was what civilized people ought to do.

it from the indians. because, of course, he was with them a lot. even

the things the other boys did. which was a good thing in a way, be- 
cause it made it easier for me to condition him a little. though you've

he played with the little boys for a long time. suddenly people started 
talking very loud, and there were the women pushing linda away, and 
linda was crying. she went to the door and he ran after her. he asked 
her why they were angry. "because i broke something," she said. and 
then she got angry too. "how should i know how to do their beastly 
weaving?" she said. "beastly savages." he asked her what savages 
were. when they got back to their house, pope was waiting at the 
door, and he came in with them. he had a big gourd full of stuff that 
looked like water; only it wasn't water, but something with a bad smell 



that burnt your mouth and made you cough. linda drank some and 
pope drank some, and then linda laughed a lot and talked very loud; 
and then she and pope went into the other room. when pope went 
away, he went into the room. linda was in bed and so fast asleep that 
he couldn't wake her. 

pope used to come often. he said the stu

mescal; but linda said it ought to be called soma; only it made you 
feel ill afterwards. he hated pope. he hated them all-all the men who 
came to see linda. one afternoon, when he had been playing with the 
other children-it was cold, he remembered, and there was snow on 
the mountains-he came back to the house and heard angry voices in 
the bedroom. they were women's voices, and they said words he 
didn't understand, but he knew they were dreadful words. then sud- 
denly, crash! something was upset; he heard people moving about 
quickly, and there was another crash and then a noise like hittin

his face. "oh, don't, linda, please don't." 

"little beast!" she pulled down his arm; his face was uncovered. 

"don't, linda." he shut his eyes, expecting the blow. 

but she didn't hit him. after a little time, he opened his eyes again and 
saw that she was looking at him. he tried to smile at her. suddenly she 
put her arms round him and kissed him again and again. 

sometimes, for several days, linda didn't get up at all. she lay in bed 
and was sad. or else she drank the stuff that pope brought and 
laughed a great deal and went to sleep. sometimes she was sick. of- 
ten she forgot to wash him, and there was nothing to eat except cold 
tortillas. he remembered the first time she found those little animals in 
his hair, how she screamed and screamed. 



the happiest times were when she told him about the other place. 
"and you really can go flying, whenever you like?" 

"whenever you like." and she would tell him about the lovely music 
that came out of a box, and all the nice

ne day (john calculated later that it must have been soon after his 
twelfth birthday) he came home and found a book that he had never 
seen before lying on the floor in the bedroom. it was a thick book and 
looked very old. the binding had been eaten by mice; some of its 
pages were loose and crumpled. he picked it up, looked at the title- 
page: the book was called the complete works of william shake- 
speare. 

linda was lying on the bed, sipping that horrible stinking mescal out of 
a cup. "pope brought it," she said. her voice was thick and hoarse like 
somebody else's voice. "it was lying in one of the chests of the ante- 
lope kiva. it's supposed to have been there for hundreds of years. i 
expect it's true, because i looked at it, and it seemed to be full of non- 
sense. uncivilized. still, it'll be good enough for you to practice your 
reading on." she took a last sip, set the cup down on the floor beside 
the bed, turned over on her side, hiccoughed once or twice and went 
to sle

that you cried; like old mitsima saying magic over his feathers and his 
carved sticks and his bits of bone and stone-kiathla tsilu silokwe si- 
lokwe silokwe. kiai silu silu, tsithl-but better than mitsima's magic, be- 



cause it meant more, because it talked to him, talked wonderfully and 
only half-understandably, a terrible beautiful magic, about linda; 
about linda lying there snoring, with the empty cup on the floor beside 
the bed; about linda and pope, linda and pope. 
he hated pope more and more. a man can smile and smile and be a 
villain. remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain. what did 
the words exactly mean? he only half knew. but their magic was 
strong and went on rumbling in his head, and somehow it was as 
though he had never really hated pope before; never really hated him 
because he had never been able to say how much he hated him. but 
now he had these words, these words like drums and singing and 
magic. these w

ords and the strange, strange story out of which they 
were taken (he couldn't make head or tail of it, but it was wonderful, 
wonderful all the same)-they gave him a reason for hating pope; and 
they made his hatred more real; they even made pope himself more 
real. 

one day, when he came in from playing, the door of the inner room 
was open, and he saw them lying together on the bed, asleep-white 
linda and pope almost black beside her, with one arm under her 
shoulders and the other dark hand on her breast, and one of the plaits 
of his long hair lying across her throat, like a black snake trying to 
strangle her. pope's gourd and a cup were standing on the floor near 
the bed. linda was snoring. 

his heart seemed to have disappeared and left a hole. he was empty. 
empty, and cold, and rather sick, and giddy. he leaned against the wall 
to steady himself. remorseless, treacherous, lecherous ... like

 kept saying. and suddenly there were more 
words. 

when he is drunk asleep, or in his rage 
or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed ... 

the magic was on his side, the magic explained and gave orders. he 
stepped back in the outer room. "when he is drunk asleep ..." the 
knife for the meat was lying on the floor near the fireplace. he picked 
it up and tiptoed to the door again. "when he is drunk asleep, drunk 
asleep ..." he ran across the room and stabbed-oh, the bloodl-stabbed 
again, as pope heaved out of his sleep, lifted his hand to stab once 



more, but found his wrist caught, held and-oh, oh!-twisted. he 
couldn't move, he was trapped, and there were pope's small black 
eyes, very close, staring into his own. he looked away. there were two 
cuts on pope's left shoulder. "oh, look at the blood!" linda was crying. 
"look at the blood!" she had never been able to bear the sight of 
blood. pope lifted his other hand-to strike him, he thought. he stiff- 
ened to receive the blow.

but the hand only took him under the chin 
and turned his face, so that he had to look again into pope's eyes. for 
a long time, for hours and hours. and suddenly-he couldn't help it-he 
began to cry. pope burst out laughing. "go," he said, in the other in- 
dian words. "go, my brave ahaiyuta." he ran out into the other room 
to hide his tears. 

"you are fifteen," said old mitsima, in the indian words. "now i may 
teach you to work the clay." 
squatting by the river, they worked together. 

"first of all," said mitsima, taking a lump of the wetted clay between 
his hands, "we make a little moon." the old man squeezed the lump 
into a disk, then bent up the edges, the moon became a shallow cup.

 all the time away, infinitely far away, on holiday; on holiday in 
some other world, where the music of the radio was a labyrinth of so- 
norous colours, a sliding, palpitating labyrinth, that led (by what beau- 
tifully inevitable windings) to a bright centre of absolute conviction; 
where the dancing images of the television box were the performers in 
some indescribably delicious all-singing feely; where the dripping 
patchouli was more than scent-was the sun, was a million saxophones, 
was pope making love, only much more so, incomparably more, and 
without end. 

"no, we can't rejuvenate. but i'm very glad," dr. shaw had concluded, 
"to have had this opportunity to see an example of senility in a human 
being. thank you so much for calling me in." he shook bernard warmly 
by the hand. 

it was john, then, they were all after. and as it was only through ber-

found himself, for the first time in his life, treated not

"yes." 



despairingly, "but what shall i do?" bernard wailed. 

"go to hell!" bawled the exasperated voice from within. 

"but the arch-community-songster of canterbury is there to-night." 
bernard was almost in tears. 

"ai yaa takwa!" it was only in zuni that the savage could adequately 
express what he felt about the arch-community-songster. "hani!" he 
added as an after-thought; and then (with what derisive ferocity!): 
"sons eso tse-na." and he spat on the ground, as pope might have 
done. 

in the end bernard had to slink back, diminished, to his rooms and in- 
form the impatient assembly that the savage would not be appearing 
that evening. the news was received with indignation. the men were 
furious at having been tricked into behaving politely to this insignifi- 
cant fellow with the unsavoury reputation and the heretical opinions. 
the higher their position in the hierarchy, the deeper their resentment.

 stirred uneasily, had opened her eyes for a moment, looked 
vaguely around, and then once more dropped off to sleep. sitting be- 
side her, the savage tried hard to recapture his mood of a few minutes 
before. "a, b, c, vitamin d," he repeated to himself, as though the 
words were a spell that would restore the dead past to life. but the 
spell was ineffective. obstinately the beautiful memories refused to 
rise; there was only a hateful resurrection of jealousies and uglinesses 
and miseries. pope with the blood trickling down from his cut shoulder; 
and linda hideously asleep, and the flies buzzing round the spilt mes- 
cal on the floor beside the bed; and the boys calling those names as 
she passed. ... ah, no, no! he shut his eyes, he shook his head in 
strenuous denial of these memories. "a, b, c, vitamin d ..." he tried to 
think of those times when he sat on her knees and she put her arms 
about him and sang, over and over again, rocking him, rocking him to 
sleep. "a, b, c, vitami

the super-vox-wurlitzeriana had risen to a sobbing crescendo; and 
suddenly the verbena gave place, in the scent-circulating system, to 
an intense patchouli. linda stirred, woke up, stared for a few seconds 
bewilderly at the semi-finalists, then, lifting her face, sniffed once or 
twice at the newly perfumed air and suddenly smiled-a smile of child- 
ish ecstasy. 

"pope!" she murmured, and closed her eyes. "oh, i do so like it, i do 
..." she sighed and let herself sink back into the pillows. 
"but, linda!" the savage spoke imploringly, "don't you know me?" he 
had tried so hard, had done his very best; why wouldn't she allow him 
to forget? he squeezed her limp hand almost with violence, as though 
he would force her to come back from this dream of ignoble pleasures, 
from these base and hateful memories-back into the present, back 
into reality: the appallin

g present, the awful reality-but sublime, but 
significant, but desperately important precisely because of the immi- 
nence of that which made them so fearful. "don't you know me, 
linda?" 

he felt the faint answering pressure of her hand. the tears started into 
his eyes. he bent over her and kissed her. 

her lips moved. "pope!" she whispered again, and it was as though he 
had had a pailful of ordure thrown in his face. 



anger suddenly boiled up in him. balked for the second time, the pas- 
sion of his grief had found another outlet, was transformed into a pas- 
sion of agonized rage. 

"but i'm john!" he shouted. "i'm john!" and in his furious misery he 
actually caught her by the shoulder and shook her.

among the inward and private equivalents of patchouli and the super- 
wurlitzer, among the transfigured memories and the strangely trans- 
posed sensations that constituted the universe of her dream. she 
knew him for john, her son, but fancied him an intruder into that 
paradisal malpais where she had been spending her soma-holiday with 
pope. he was angry because she liked pope, he was shaking her be- 
cause pope was there in the bed-as though there were something 
wrong, as though all civilized people didn't do the same. "every one 
belongs to every ..." her voice suddenly died into an almost inaudible 
breathless croaking. her mouth fell open: she made a desperate effort 
to fill her lungs with air. but it was as though she had forgotten how to 
breathe. she tried to cry out-but no sound came; only the terror of 
her staring eyes revealed what she was suffering. her hands went to 
her throat, then cla
