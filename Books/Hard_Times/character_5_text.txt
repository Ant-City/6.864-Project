chapter vii
mrs. sparsit


mr. bounderby being a bachelor, an elderly lady presided over his
establishment, in consideration of a certain annual stipend.  mrs.
sparsit was this ladyâ€™s name; and she was a prominent figure in
attendance on mr. bounderbyâ€™s car, as it rolled along in triumph with the
bully of humility inside.

for, mrs. sparsit had not only seen different days, but was highly
connected.  she had a great aunt living in these very times called lady
scadgers.  mr. sparsit, deceased, of whom she was the re

lict, had been by
the motherâ€™s side what mrs. sparsit still called â€˜a powler.â€™  strangers
of limited information and dull apprehension were sometimes observed not
to know what a powler was, and even to appear uncertain whether it might
be a business, or a political party, or a profession of faith.  the
better class of minds, however, did not need to be informed that the
powlers were an ancient stock, who could trace themselves so exceedingly
far back that it was not surprising if they sometimes lost
themselvesâ€”which they had rather frequentl

the late mr. sparsit, being by the motherâ€™s side a powler, married this
lady, being by the fatherâ€™s side a scadgers.  lady scadgers (an immensely
fat old woman, with an inordinate appetite for butcherâ€™s meat, and a
mysterious leg which had now refused to get out of bed for fourteen
years) contrived the marriage, at a period when sparsit was just of age,
and chiefly noticeable for a slender body, weakly supported on two long
slim props, and surmounted by no head worth mentioning.  he inherited a
fair fortune from his uncle, but owed it all before he came into it, and
spent it twice over immediately afterwards.  thus, when he died, at
twenty-four (the scene of his decease, calais, and the cause, brandy), he
did not leave his widow, from whom he had been separated soon after the
honeymoon, in affluent circumstances.  that bereave

d lady, fifteen years
older than he, fell presently at deadly feud with her only relative, lady
scadgers; and, partly to spite her ladyship, and partly to maintain
herself, went out at a salary.  and here she was now, in her elderly
days, with the coriolanian style of nose and the dense black eyebrows
which had captivated sparsit, making mr. bounderbyâ€™s tea as he took his
breakfast.

if bounderby had been a conqueror, and mrs. sparsit a captive princess
whom he took about as a feature in his state-processions, he could not
have made a greater flourish with her than he habitually did.  just as it
belonged to his boastfulness to depreciate his own extraction, so it
belonged to it to exalt mrs. sparsitâ€™s.  in the measure that he would not
allow his own youth to have been attended by a single favourable
circumstance, he brightened mrs. sparsitâ€™s juvenile career with every
possible advantage, and showered waggon-loads of earl

made him out to be the royal arms, the
union-jack, magna charta, john bull, habeas corpus, the bill of rights,

orator of this kind brought into his peroration,

    â€˜princes and lords may flourish or may fade,
    a breath can make them, as a breath has made,â€™

â€”it was, for certain, more or less understood among the company that he
had heard of mrs. sparsit.

â€˜mr. bounderby,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, â€˜you are unusually slow, sir, with
your breakfast this morning.â€™

â€˜why, maâ€™am,â€™ he returned, â€˜i am thinking about tom gradgrindâ€™s whim;â€™
tom gradgrind, for a bluff independent manner of speakingâ€”as if somebody
were always endeavouring to bribe him with immense sums to say thomas,
and he wouldnâ€™t; â€˜tom gradgrindâ€™s whim, maâ€™am, of bringing up the
tumbling-girl.â€™

â€˜the girl is now waiting to know,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, â€˜whet
 
 ___________________________
 
he must wait, maâ€™am,â€™ answered bounderby, â€˜till i know myself.  we
shall have tom gradgrind down here presently, i suppose.  if he should
wish her to remain here a day or two longer, of course she can, maâ€™am.â€™

â€˜of course she can if you wish it, mr. bounderby.â€™

â€˜i told him i would give her a shake-down here, last night, in order that
he might sleep on it before he decided to let her have any association
with louisa.â€™

â€˜indeed, mr. bounderby?  very thoughtful of you!â€™  mrs. sparsitâ€™s
coriolanian nose underwent a slight expansion of the nostrils, and her
black eyebrows contracted as she took a sip of tea.

â€˜itâ€™s tolerably clear to _me_,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜that the little puss can
get small good out of such companionship.â€™

â€˜are you speaking of young miss gradgrind, mr. bounderby?â€™

â€˜yes, maâ€™am, iâ€™m speaking of louisa.â€™

â€˜your observation being limited to â€œlittle puss,â€â€™ said mrs. sparsit,
â€˜and there being two little girls in question, i did

â€˜louisa,â€™ repeated mr. bounderby.  â€˜louisa, louisa.â€™

â€˜you are quite another father to louisa, sir.â€™  mrs. sparsit took a
little more tea; and, as she bent her again contracted eyebrows over her
steaming cup, rather looked as if her classical countenance were invoking
the infernal gods.

â€˜if you had said i was another father to tomâ€”young tom, i mean, not my
friend tom gradgrindâ€”you might have been nearer the mark.  i am going to
take young tom into my office.  going to have him under my wing, maâ€™am.â€™

â€˜indeed?  rather young for that, is he not, sir?â€™  mrs. spiritâ€™s â€˜sir,â€™

have been speaking to you this morning about tumblers.  why, what do
_you_ know about tumblers?  at the time when, to have been a tumbler in
the mud of the streets, would have been a godsend to me, a prize in the
lottery to me, you were at the italian opera.  you were coming out of the
italian opera, maâ€™am, in white satin and jewels, a blaze of splendour,
when i hadnâ€™t a penny to buy a link to light you.â€™

â€˜i certainly, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, with a dignity serenely
mournful, â€˜was familiar with the italian opera at a very early age.â€™

â€˜egad, maâ€™am, so was i,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜â€”with the wrong side of it.  a
hard bed the pavement of its arcade used to make, i assure you.  people
like you, maâ€™am, accustomed from infancy to lie on down feathers, have no
idea _how_ hard a paving-stone is, without trying it.  no, no, itâ€™s of no
use my talking to _you_ about tumblers.  i should speak of foreign

â€˜i trust, sir,â€™ rejoined mrs. sparsit, with decent resignation, â€˜it is
not necessary that you should do anything of that kind.  i hope i have
learnt how to accommodate myself to the changes of life.  if i have
acquired an interest in hearing of your instructive experiences, and can
scarcely hear enough of them, i claim no merit for that, since i believe
it is a general sentiment.â€™

â€˜well, maâ€™am,â€™ said her patron, â€˜perhaps some people may be pleased to
say that they do like to hear, in his own unpolished way, what josiah

born in the lap of luxury.â€™

â€˜i do not, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit with a shake of her head, â€˜deny
it.â€™

mr. bounderby was obliged to get up from table, and stand with his back
to the fire, looking at her; she was such an enhancement of his position.

â€˜and you were in crack society.  devilish high society,â€™ he said, warming
his legs.

â€˜it is true, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, with an affectation of humility
the very opposite of his, and therefore in no danger of jostling it.

â€˜you were in the tiptop fashion, and all the rest of it,â€™ said mr.

underby.

â€˜yes, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, with a kind of social widowhood upon
her.  â€˜it is unquestionably true.â€™

mr. bounderby, bending himself at the knees, literally embraced his legs
in his great satisfaction and laughed aloud.  mr. and miss gradgrind
being then announced, he received the former with a shake of the hand,
and the latter with a kiss.

â€˜can jupe be sent here, bounderby?â€™ asked mr. gradgrind.

certainly.  so jupe was sent there.  on coming in, she curtseyed to mr.
bounderby, and to his friend tom gradgrind, a

her confusion unluckily omitted mrs. sparsit.  observing this, the
blustrous bounderby had the following remarks to make:

â€˜now, i tell you what, my girl.  the name of that lady by the teapot, is
mrs. sparsit.  that lady acts as mistress of this house, and she is a
highly connected lady.  consequently, if ever you come again into any
room in this house, you will make a short stay in it if you donâ€™t behave
towards that lady in your most respectful manner.  now, i donâ€™t care a
button what you do to _me_, because i donâ€™t affect to be anybody.  so far
from having high connections i have no connections at all, and i come of
the scum of the earth.  but towards that lady, i do care what you do; and
y
 
 ___________________________
 
ou shall do what is deferential and respectful, or you shall not come
here.â€™

â€˜i hope, bounderby,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, in a conciliatory voice, â€˜that
this was merely an oversight.â€™

â€˜my friend tom gradgrind suggests, mrs. sparsit,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜that
this was merely an oversight.  very likely.  however, as you are aware,
maâ€™am, i donâ€™t allow of even oversights towards you.â€™

â€˜you are very good indeed, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, shaking her head
with her state humility.  â€˜it is not worth speaking of.â€™

sissy, who all this time had been faintly excusing herself with tears in
her eyes, was now waved over by the master of the house to mr. gradgrind.
she stood looking intently at him, and louisa stood coldly by, with her
eyes upon the ground, while he proceeded thus:

â€˜jupe, i have made up my mind to take you into my house; and, when you
are not in attendance at the school, to employ you about mrs. gradgrind,
who is
 
 ___________________________
 
destructive nonsense any more.  bounderby, this is a case for rigid
training, and i shall observe it with interest.â€™

â€˜well,â€™ returned mr. bounderby, â€˜i have given you my opinion already, and
i shouldnâ€™t do as you do.  but, very well, very well.  since you are bent
upon it, _very_ well!â€™

so, mr. gradgrind and his daughter took cecilia jupe off with them to
stone lodge, and on the way louisa never spoke one word, good or bad.
and mr. bounderby went about his daily pursuits.  and mrs. sparsit got
behind her eyebrows and meditated in the gloom of that retreat, all the
evening.



chapter viii
never wonder


let us strike the key-note again, before pursuing the tune.

when she was half a dozen years younger, louisa had been overheard to
begin a conversation with her brother one day, by saying â€˜tom, i
wonderâ€™â€”upon which mr. gradgrind, who was the person overhearing, stepped
forth into the light and said, â€˜louisa, never wonder!â€™

brazen door-handle underneath it, like a brazen full-stop.

mr. bounderby was at his lunch.  so stephen had expected.  would his
servant say that one of the hands begged leave to speak to him?  message
in return, requiring name of such hand.  stephen blackpool.  there was
nothing troublesome against stephen blackpool; yes, he might come in.

stephen blackpool in the parlour.  mr. bounderby (whom he just knew by
sight), at lunch on chop and sherry.  mrs. sparsit netting at the
fireside, in a side-saddle attitude, with one foot in a cotton stirrup.
it was a part, at once of mrs. sparsitâ€™s dignity and service, not to
lunch.  she supervised the meal officially, but implied that in her own
stately person she considered lunch a weakness.

â€˜now, stephen,â€™ said mr. bounderby, â€˜whatâ€™s the matter with _you_?â€™

stephen made a bow.  not a servile oneâ€”these hands will never do that!
lord bless you, sir, youâ€™ll never catch them at that, if they have

 been
with you twenty years!â€”and, as a complimentary toilet for mrs. sparsit,
tucked his neckerchief ends into his waistcoat.

â€˜now, you know,â€™ said mr. bounderby, taking some sherry, â€˜we have never
had any difficulty with you, and you have never been one of the
unreasonable ones.  you donâ€™t expect to be set up in a coach and six, and
to be fed on turtle soup and venison, with a gold spoon, as a good many
of â€™em do!â€™  mr. bounderby always represented this to be the sole,
immediate, and direct object of any hand who was not entirely satisfied;
â€˜and therefor

ot come here to make a
complaint.  now, you know, i am certain of that, beforehand.â€™

â€˜no, sir, sure i haâ€™ not coom for nowt oâ€™ thâ€™ kind.â€™

mr. bounderby seemed agreeably surprised, notwithstanding his previous
strong conviction.  â€˜very well,â€™ he returned.  â€˜youâ€™re a steady hand, and
i was not mistaken.  now, let me hear what itâ€™s all about.  as itâ€™s not
that, let me hear what it is.  what have you got to say?  out with it,
lad!â€™

stephen happened to glance towards mrs. sparsit.  â€˜i can go, mr.
bounderby, if you wish it,â€™ said that self-sacrificing lady, making a
feint of taking her foot out of the stirrup.

mr. bounderby stayed her, by holding a mouthful of chop in suspension
before swallowing it, and putting out his left hand.  then, withdrawing
his hand and swallowing his mouthful of chop, he said to stephen:

â€˜now you know, this good lady is a born lady, a high lady.  you are not
to suppose because she keeps my house for me, that she hasnâ€™t been very
high

epened as he said it, and put in its affecting
evidence of the suffering he had undergone.

â€˜from bad to worse, from worse to worsen.  she left me.  she disgraced
herseln everyways, bitter and bad.  she coom back, she coom back, she
coom back.  what could i do tâ€™ hinder her?  i haâ€™ walked the streets
nights long, ere ever iâ€™d go home.  i haâ€™ gone tâ€™ thâ€™ brigg, minded to
fling myseln ower, and haâ€™ no more onâ€™t.  i haâ€™ bore that much, that i
were owd when i were young.â€™

mrs. sparsit, easily ambling along with her netting-needles, raised the
coriolanian eyebrows and shook her head, as much as to say, â€˜the great
know trouble as well as the small.  please to turn your humble eye in my
direction.â€™

â€˜i haâ€™ paid her to keep awaâ€™ fraâ€™ me.  these five year i haâ€™ paid her.  i
haâ€™ gotten decent fewtrils about me agen.  i haâ€™ lived hard and sad, but
not ashamed and fearfoâ€™ aâ€™ the minnits oâ€™ my life.  last night, i went

ith a rugged propriety and force of action, very
earnestly emphasizing what he said: not least so when it always paused, a
little bent, but not withdrawn, as he paused.

â€˜i was acquainted with all this, you know,â€™ said mr. bounderby, â€˜except
the last clause, long ago.  itâ€™s a bad job; thatâ€™s what it is.  you had
better have been satisfied as you were, and not have got married.
however, itâ€™s too late to say that.â€™

â€˜was it an unequal marriage, sir, in point of years?â€™ asked mrs. sparsit.

â€˜you hear what this lady asks.  was it an unequal marriage in point of
years, this unlucky job of yours?â€™ said mr. bounderby.

â€˜not eâ€™en so.  i were one-and-twenty myseln; she were twenty nighbut.â€™

â€˜indeed, sir?â€™ said mrs. sparsit to her chief, with great placidity.  â€˜i
inferred, from its being so miserable a marriage, that it was probably an
unequal one in point of years.â€™

mr. bounderby looked very hard at the good lady in a side-long way that
had an odd sheepishness abou

more sherry.

â€˜well?  why donâ€™t you go on?â€™ he then asked, turning rather irritably on
stephen blackpool.

â€˜i haâ€™ coom to ask yo, sir, how i am to be ridded oâ€™ this woman.â€™
stephen infused a yet deeper gravity into the mixed expression of his
attentive face.  mrs. sparsit uttered a gentle ejaculation, as having
received a moral shock.

â€˜what do you mean?â€™ said bounderby, getting up to lean his back against
the chimney-piece.  â€˜what are you talking about?  you took her for better
for worse.â€™

â€˜i munâ€™ be ridden oâ€™ her.  i cannot bear â€™t nommore.  i haâ€™ lived under
â€™t so long, for that i haâ€™ hadâ€™n the pity and comforting words oâ€™ thâ€™
best lass living or dead.  haply, but for her, i should haâ€™ gone
battering mad.â€™

â€˜he wishes to be

sir,â€™ observed mrs. sparsit in an undertone, and much dejected by the
immorality of the people.

â€˜i do.  the lady says whatâ€™s right.  i do.  i were a coming to â€™t.  i haâ€™
read iâ€™ thâ€™ papers that great folk (fair faw â€™em aâ€™!  i wishes â€™em no

said mr. bounderby.  â€˜perhaps twice the money.â€™

â€˜thereâ€™s no other law?â€™

â€˜certainly not.â€™

â€˜why then, sir,â€™ said stephen, turning white, and motioning with that
right hand of his, as if he gave everything to the four winds, â€˜â€™_tis_ a
muddle.  â€™tis just a muddle aâ€™toogether, anâ€™ the sooner i am dead, the
better.â€™

(mrs. sparsit again dejected by the impiety of the people.)

â€˜pooh, pooh!  donâ€™t you talk nonsense, my good fellow,â€™ said mr.
bounderby, â€˜about things you donâ€™t understand; and donâ€™t you call the
institutions of your country a muddle, or youâ€™ll get yourself into a real
muddle one of these fine mornings.  the institutions of your country are
not your piece-work, and the only thing you have got to do, is, to mind
your piece-work.  you didnâ€™t take your wife for fast and for loose; but

soup, and venison, and gold spoon in this.  yes, i do!â€™ cried mr.
bounderby, shaking his head with obstinate cunning.  â€˜by the lord harry,
i do!â€™

with a very different shake of the head and deep sigh, stephen said,
â€˜thank you, sir, i wish you good day.â€™  so he left mr. bounderby swelling
at his own portrait on the wall, as if he were going to explode himself
into it; and mrs. sparsit still ambling on with her foot in her stirrup,
looking quite cast down by the popular vices.

the old woman


old stephen descended the two white steps, shutting the black door with
the brazen door-plate, by the aid of the brazen full-stop, to which he
gave a parting polish with the sleeve of his coat, observing that his hot
hand clouded it.  he crossed the street with his eyes bent upon the
ground, and thus was walking sorrowfully away, when he felt a touch upon
his arm.

or yesterday, loo?â€™

â€˜no, tom.  but he told me to-night that he wished to do so in the
morning.â€™

â€˜ah!  thatâ€™s what i mean,â€™ said tom.  â€˜do you know where he is
to-night?â€™â€”with a very deep expression.

â€˜no.â€™

â€˜then iâ€™ll tell you.  heâ€™s with old bounderby.  they are having a regular
confab together up at the bank.  why at the bank, do you think?  well,
iâ€™ll tell you again.  to keep mrs. sparsitâ€™s ears as far off as possible,
i expect.â€™

with her hand upon her brotherâ€™s shoulder, louisa still stood looking at
the fire.  her brother glanced at her face with greater interest than
usual, and, encircling her waist with his arm, drew her coaxingly to him.

â€˜you are very fond of me, anâ€™t you, loo?â€™

â€˜indeed i am, tom, though you do let such long intervals go by without
coming to see me.â€™

â€˜well, sister of mine,â€™ said tom, â€˜when you say that, you are near my

n mr. gradgrind had presented mrs. bounderby, sissy had suddenly
turned her head, and looked, in wonder, in pity, in sorrow, in doubt, in
a multitude of emotions, towards louisa.  louisa had known it, and seen
it, without looking at her.  from that moment she was impassive, proud
and coldâ€”held sissy at a distanceâ€”changed to her altogether.

husband and wife


mr. bounderbyâ€™s first disquietude on hearing of his happiness, was
occasioned by the necessity of imparting it to mrs. sparsit.  he could
not make up his mind how to do that, or what the consequences of the step
might be.  whether she would instantly depart, bag and baggage, to lady
scadgers, or would positively refuse to budge from the premises; whether
she would be plaintive or abusive, tearful or tearing; whether she would
break her heart, or break the looking-glass; mr. bounderby could not all
foresee.  however, as it must be done, he had no choice but to do it; so,
after attempting several letters, and failing in

before the object of his misgivings, like a dog who was conscious of
coming direct from the pantry.

â€˜good evening, mr. bounderby!â€™

â€˜good evening, maâ€™am, good evening.â€™  he drew up his chair, and mrs.
sparsit drew back hers, as who should say, â€˜your fireside, sir.  i freely
admit it.  it is for you to occupy it all, if you think proper.â€™

â€˜donâ€™t go to the north pole, maâ€™am!â€™ said mr. bounderby.

â€˜thank you, sir,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, and returned, though short of her
former position.

mr. bounderby sat looking at her, as, with the points of a stiff, sharp
pair of scissors, she picked out holes for some inscrutable ornamental
purpose, in a piece of cambric.  an operation which, taken in connexion
with the bushy eyebrows and the roman nose, suggested with some
liveliness the idea of a hawk engaged upon the eyes of a tough little
bird.  she was so steadfastly occupied, that many minutes elapsed before
she looked up from her w

ork; when she did so mr. bounderby bespoke her
attention with a hitch of his head.

â€˜mrs. sparsit, maâ€™am,â€™ said mr. bounderby, putting his hands in his
pockets, and assuring himself with his right hand that the cork of the
little bottle was ready for use, â€˜i have no occasion to say to you, that
you are not only a lady born and bred, but a devilish sensible woman.â€™

â€˜sir,â€™ returned the lady, â€˜this is indeed not the first time that you
have honoured me with similar expressions of your good opinion.â€™

â€˜mrs. sparsit, maâ€™am,â€™ said mr. bounderby, â€˜i am going to astonish yo

u.â€™

â€˜yes, sir?â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, interrogatively, and in the most
tranquil manner possible.  she generally wore mittens, and she now laid
down her work, and smoothed those mittens.

â€˜i am going, maâ€™am,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜to marry tom gradgrindâ€™s daughter.â€™

â€˜yes, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit.  â€˜i hope you may be happy, mr.
bounderby.  oh, indeed i hope you may be happy, sir!â€™  and she said it
with such great condescension as well as with such great compassion for
him, that bounderby,â€”far more disconcerted than if she had thrown her
workbox at the mirror, or swooned on the hearthrug,â€”corked up the
smelling-salts tight in his pocket, and thought, â€˜now confound this
woman, who could have even guessed that she would take it in this way!â€™

â€˜i wish with all my heart, sir,â€
 
 ___________________________
 
™ said mrs. sparsit, in a highly superior
manner; somehow she seemed, in a moment, to have established a right to
pity him ever afterwards; â€˜that you may be in all respects very happy.â€™

â€˜well, maâ€™am,â€™ returned bounderby, with some resentment in his tone:
which was clearly lowered, though in spite of himself, â€˜i am obliged to
you.  i hope i shall be.â€™

â€˜_do_ you, sir!â€™ said mrs. sparsit, with great affability.  â€˜but
naturally you do; of course you do.â€™

a very awkward pause on mr. bounderbyâ€™s part, succeeded.  mrs. sparsit
sedately resumed her work and occasionally gave a small cough, which
sounded like the cough of conscious strength and forbearance.

â€˜well, maâ€™am,â€™ resumed bounderby, â€˜under these circumstances, i imagine
it would not be agreeable to a character like yours to remain here,
though you would be very welcome here.â€™

â€˜oh, dear no, sir, i could on

 no account think of that!â€™ mrs. sparsit
shook her head, still in her highly superior manner, and a little changed
the small coughâ€”coughing now, as if the spirit of prophecy rose within
her, but had better be coughed down.

â€˜however, maâ€™am,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜there are apartments at the bank,
where a born and bred lady, as keeper of the place, would be rather a
catch than otherwise; and if the same termsâ€”â€™

â€˜i beg your pardon, sir.  you were so good as to promise that you would
always substitute the phrase, annual compl

iment.â€™

â€˜well, maâ€™am, annual compliment.  if the same annual compliment would be
acceptable there, why, i see nothing to part us, unless you do.â€™

â€˜sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit.  â€˜the proposal is like yourself, and if the
position i shall assume at the bank is one that i could occupy without
descending lower in the social scaleâ€”â€™

â€˜why, of course it is,â€™ said bounderby.  â€˜if it was not, maâ€™am, you donâ€™t
suppose that i should offer it to a lady who has moved in the society you
have moved in.  not that _i_ care for such society, you know!  but _you_
do.â€™

â€˜mr. bounderby, you are very considerate.â€™

â€˜youâ€™ll have your own private apartments, and 
 
 ___________________________
 
youâ€™ll have your coals and
your candles, and all the rest of it, and youâ€™ll have your maid to attend
upon you, and youâ€™ll have your light porter to protect you, and youâ€™ll be
what i take the liberty of considering precious comfortable,â€™ said
bounderby.

â€˜sir,â€™ rejoined mrs. sparsit, â€˜say no more.  in yielding up my trust
here, i shall not be freed from the necessity of eating the bread of
dependence:â€™ she might have said the sweetbread, for that delicate
article in a savoury brown sauce was her favourite supper: â€˜and i would
rather receive it from your hand, than from any other.  therefore, sir, i
accept your offer gratefully, and with many sincere acknowledgments for
past favours.  and i hope, sir,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, concluding in an
impressively compassionate m

anner, â€˜i fondly hope that miss gradgrind may
be all you desire, and deserve!â€™

nothing moved mrs. sparsit from that position any more.  it was in vain
for bounderby to bluster or to assert himself in any of his explosive
ways; mrs. sparsit was resolved to have compassion on him, as a victim.
she was polite, obliging, cheerful, hopeful; but, the more polite, the
more obliging, the more cheerful, the more hopeful, the more exemplary
altogether, she; the forlorner sacrifice and victim, he.  she had that
tenderness for his melancholy fate, that his great red countenance used
to break out into cold perspirations when she looked at him.

meanwhile the marriage was appointed to be solemnized in eight weeksâ€™
time, and mr. bounderby wen

which made a spumous track upon the water as it jogged along, while every
dip of an oar stirred up vile smells.  but the sun itself, however
beneficent, generally, was less kind to coketown than hard frost, and
rarely looked intently into any of its closer regions without engendering
more death than life.  so does the eye of heaven itself become an evil
eye, when incapable or sordid hands are interposed between it and the
things it looks upon to bless.

mrs. sparsit sat in her afternoon apartment at the bank, on the shadier
side of the frying street.  office-hours were over: and at that period of
the day, in warm weather, she usually embellished with her genteel
presence, a managerial board-room over the public office.  her own
private sitting-room was a story higher, at the window of which post of
observation she was ready, every morning, to greet mr. bounderby, as he
came across the road, with the sympathizing recognition appropriate to a
victim.  he had

released him from her determined pity a moment.

the bank offered no violence to the wholesome monotony of the town.  it
was another red brick house, with black outside shutters, green inside
blinds, a black street-door up two white steps, a brazen door-plate, and
a brazen door-handle full stop.  it was a size larger than mr.
bounderbyâ€™s house, as other houses were from a size to half-a-dozen sizes
smaller; in all other particulars, it was strictly according to pattern.

 upon the office.  seated, with her needlework or
netting apparatus, at the window, she had a self-laudatory sense of
correcting, by her ladylike deportment, the rude business aspect of the
place.  with this impression of her interesting character upon her, mrs.
sparsit considered herself, in some sort, the bank fairy.  the
townspeople who, in their passing and repassing, saw her there, regarded
her as the bank dragon keeping watch over the treasures of the mine.

what those treasures were, mrs. sparsit knew as little as they did.  gold
and silver coin, precious paper, secrets that if divulged would bring
vague destruction upon vague persons (generally, however, people whom she
disliked), were the chief items in her ideal catalogue thereof.  for the
rest, she knew that after office-hours, she reigned supreme over all the
office furniture, and over a locked-up iron room with three locks,
against the door of which strong chamber the light porter laid his head
every night, on a truckle bed, that

disappeared at cockcrow.  further,
she was lady paramount over certain vaults in the basement, sharply
spiked off from communication with the predatory world; and over the
relics of the current dayâ€™s work, consisting of blots of ink, worn-out
pens, fragments of wafers, and scraps of paper torn so small, that
nothing interesting could ever be deciphered on them when mrs. sparsit
tried.  lastly, she was guardian over a little armoury of cutlasses and
carbines, arrayed in vengeful order above one of the official
chimney-pieces; and over that respectable tradition never to be separated
from a place of business claiming to be wealthyâ€”a row of
fire-bucketsâ€”vessels calculated to be of no physical utility on any
occasion, but observed to exercise a fine moral influence, almost equal
to bullion, on most beholders.

empire.  the deaf serving-woman was rumoured to be wealthy; and a saying
had for years gone about among the lower orders of coketown, that she
would be murdered some night when the bank was shut, for the sake of her
money.  it was generally considered, indeed, that she had been due some
time, and ought to have fallen long ago; but she had kept her life, and
her situation, with an ill-conditioned tenacity that occasioned much
offence and disappointment.

mrs. sparsitâ€™s tea was just set for her on a pert little table, with its
tripod of legs in an attitude, which she insinuated after office-hours,
into the company of the stern, leathern-topped, long board-table that
bestrode the middle of the room.  the light porter placed the tea-tray on
it, knuckling his forehead as a form of homage.

â€˜thank you, bitzer,â€™ said mrs. sparsit.

â€˜thank _you_, maâ€™am,â€™ returned the light porter.  he was a very light
porter indeed; as light as in the days when he blin

â€˜all is shut up, maâ€™am.â€™

â€˜and what,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, pouring out her tea, â€˜is the news of the
day?  anything?â€™

â€˜well, maâ€™am, i canâ€™t say that i have heard anything particular.  our
people are a bad lot, maâ€™am; but that is no news, unfortunately.â€™

â€˜what are the restless wretches doing now?â€™ asked mrs. sparsit.

â€˜merely going on in the old way, maâ€™am.  uniting, and leaguing, and
engaging to stand by one another.â€™

â€˜it is much to be regretted,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, making her nose more
roman and her eyebrows more coriolanian in the strength of her severity,
â€˜that the united masters allow of any such class-combinations.â€™

â€˜yes, maâ€™am,â€™ said bitzer.

â€˜being united themselves, they ought one and all to set their faces
against employing any man who is united with any other man,â€™ said

 mrs.
sparsit.

â€˜they have done that, maâ€™am,â€™ returned bitzer; â€˜but it rather fell
through, maâ€™am.â€™

â€˜i do not pretend to understand these things,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, with
dignity, â€˜my lot having been signally cast in a widely different sphere;
and mr. sparsit, as a powler, being also quite out of the pale of any
such dissensions.  i only know that these people must be conquered, and
that itâ€™s high time it was done, once for all.â€™

â€˜yes, maâ€™am,â€™ returned bitzer, with a demonstration of great respect for
mrs. sparsitâ€™s oracular authority.  â€˜you couldnâ€™t put it clearer, i am
sure, maâ€™am.â€™

inkstands, and so forth, while that lady went on with her tea, glancing
through the open window, down into the street.

â€˜has it been a busy day, bitzer?â€™ asked mrs. sparsit.

â€˜not a very busy day, my lady.  about an average day.â€™  he now and then
slided into my lady, instead of maâ€™am, as an involuntary acknowledgment
of mrs. sparsitâ€™s personal dignity and claims to reverence.

â€˜the clerks,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, carefully brushing an imperceptible
crumb of bread and butter from her left-hand mitten, â€˜are trustworthy,
punctual, and industrious, of course?â€™

â€˜yes, maâ€™am, pretty fair, maâ€™am.  with the usual exception.â€™

secondly, because his only reasonable transaction in that commodity would
have been to buy it for as little as he could possibly give, and sell it

by philosophers that in this is comprised the whole duty of manâ€”not a
part of manâ€™s duty, but the whole.

â€˜pretty fair, maâ€™am.  with the usual exception, maâ€™am,â€™ repeated bitzer.

â€˜ahâ€”h!â€™ said mrs. sparsit, shaking her head over her tea-cup, and taking
a long gulp.

â€˜mr. thomas, maâ€™am, i doubt mr. thomas very much, maâ€™am, i donâ€™t like his
ways at all.â€™

â€˜bitzer,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, in a very impressive manner, â€˜do you
recollect my having said anything to you respecting names?â€™

â€˜i beg your pardon, maâ€™am.  itâ€™s quite true that you did object to names
being used, and theyâ€™re always best avoided.â€™

recognition of my family descent, that i could possibly expect.  more,
far more.  therefore, to my patron i will be scrupulously true.  and i do

with a most extensive stock on hand of honour and morality, â€˜that i

this roof, that are unfortunatelyâ€”most unfortunatelyâ€”no doubt of
thatâ€”connected with his.â€™

bitzer knuckled his forehead again, and again begged pardon.

â€˜no, bitzer,â€™ continued mrs. sparsit, â€˜say an individual, and i will hear
you; say mr. thomas, and you must excuse me.â€™

â€˜ahâ€”h!â€™  mrs. sparsit repeated the ejaculation, the shake of the head
over her tea-cup, and the long gulp, as taking up the conversation again
at the point where it had been interrupted.

â€˜an individual, maâ€™am,â€™ said bitzer, â€˜has never been what he ought to
have been, since he first came into the place.  he is a dissipated,
extravagant idler.  he is not worth his salt, maâ€™am.  he wouldnâ€™t get it
either, if he hadnâ€™t a friend and relation at court, maâ€™am!â€™

â€˜ahâ€”h!â€™ said mrs. sparsit, with anot

her melancholy shake of her head.

â€˜i only hope, maâ€™am,â€™ pursued bitzer, â€˜that his friend and relation may
not supply him with the means of carrying on.  otherwise, maâ€™am, we know
out of whose pocket _that_ money comes.â€™

â€˜ahâ€”h!â€™ sighed mrs. sparsit again, with another melancholy shake of her
head.

â€˜he is to be pitied, maâ€™am.  the last party i have alluded to, is to be
pitied, maâ€™am,â€™ said bitzer.

â€˜yes, bitzer,â€™ said mrs. sparsit.  â€˜i have always pitied the delusion,
always.â€™

â€˜as to an individual, maâ€™am,â€™ said bitzer, dropping his voice and drawing
nearer, â€˜he is as improvident as any of the people in this town.  and you
know what _their_ improvidence is, maâ€™am.  no one could wish to know it
better than a lady of your eminence does.â€™

â€˜they would do well,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, â€˜to take example by you,
bitzer.â€™

â€˜thank you, maâ€™am.  but, since you do refer to me, now look at me, maâ€™am.

i have no doubt, that by watching and informing upon one another could
earn a trifle now and then, whether in money or good will, and improve
their livelihood.  then, why donâ€™t they improve it, maâ€™am!  itâ€™s the
first consideration of a rational creature, and itâ€™s what they pretend to
want.â€™

â€˜pretend indeed!â€™ said mrs. sparsit.

â€˜i am sure we are constantly hearing, maâ€™am, till it becomes quite
nauseous, concerning their wives and families,â€™ said bitzer.  â€˜why look
at me, maâ€™am!  i donâ€™t want a wife and family.  why should they?â€™

â€˜because they are improvident,â€™ said mrs. sparsit.

â€˜yes, maâ€™am,â€™ returned bitzer, â€˜thatâ€™s where it is.  if they were more
provident and less perverse, maâ€™am, what would they do?  they would say,

â€˜to be sure,â€™ assented mrs. sparsit, eating muffin.

â€˜thank you, maâ€™am,â€™ said bitzer, knuckling his forehead again, in return
for the favour of mrs. sparsitâ€™s improving conversation.  â€˜would you wish
a little more hot water, maâ€™am, or is there anything else that i could
fetch you?â€™

â€˜nothing just now, bitzer.â€™

â€˜thank you, maâ€™am.  i shouldnâ€™t wish to disturb you at your meals, maâ€™am,
particularly tea, knowing your partiality for it,â€™ said bitzer, craning a
little to look over into the street from where he stood; â€˜but thereâ€™s a

he stepped to the window; and looking out, and drawing in his head again,
confirmed himself with, â€˜yes, maâ€™am.  would you wish the gentleman to be
shown in, maâ€™am?â€™

â€˜i donâ€™t know who it can be,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, wiping her mouth and
arranging her mittens.

â€˜a stranger, maâ€™am, evidently.â€™

â€˜what a stranger can want at the bank at this time of the evening, unless
he comes upon some business for which he is too late, i donâ€™t know,â€™ said
mrs. sparsit, â€˜but i hold a charge in this establishment from mr.

the duty i have accepted, i will see him.  use your own discretion,
bitzer.â€™

here the visitor, all unconscious of m

rs. sparsitâ€™s magnanimous words,
repeated his knock so loudly that the light porter hastened down to open
the door; while mrs. sparsit took the precaution of concealing her little
table, with all its appliances upon it, in a cupboard, and then decamped
up-stairs, that she might appear, if needful, with the greater dignity.

â€˜if you please, maâ€™am, the gentleman would wish to see you,â€™ said bitzer,
with his light eye at mrs. sparsitâ€™s keyhole.  so, mrs. sparsit, who had
improved the interval by touching up her cap, took her classical features
down-stairs again, and entered the board-room in the manner of a roman
matron going outside the city walls to treat with an invading general.

the visitor having strolled to the window, and being then engaged in
looking carelessly out, was as unmoved by this impressive entry as man
could possibly be.  he stood whistling to himself with all imaginable
coolness, with his hat still on, and a certain air of exhaustio

him, in part arising from excessive summer, and in part from excessive
gentility.  for it was to be seen with half an eye that he was a thorough
gentleman, made to the model of the time; weary of everything, and
putting no more faith in anything than lucifer.

â€˜i believe, sir,â€™ quoth mrs. sparsit, â€˜you wished to see me.â€™

â€˜i beg your pardon,â€™ he said, turning and removing his hat; â€˜pray excuse
me.â€™

â€˜humph!â€™ thought mrs. sparsit, as she made a stately bend.  â€˜five and
thirty, good-looking, good figure, good teeth, good voice, good breeding,
well-dressed, dark hair, bold eyes.â€™  all which mrs. sparsit observed in
her womanly wayâ€”like the sultan who put his head in the pail of
waterâ€”merely in dipping down and coming up again.

â€˜in general much blacker,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, in her uncompromising
way.

â€˜is it possible!  excuse me: you are not a native, i think?â€™

â€˜no, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit.  â€˜it was once my good or ill fortune,

mrs. sparsit repeated, â€˜a powler.â€™

sparsit signified assent.  the stranger seemed a little more fatigued
than before.

â€˜i am the servant of circumstances, sir,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, â€˜and i have

â€˜very philosophical,â€™ returned the stranger, â€˜and very exemplary and
laudable, andâ€”â€™  it seemed to be scarcely worth his while to finish the
sentence, so he played with his watch-chain wearily.

â€˜may i be permitted to ask, sir,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, â€˜to what i am
indebted for the favour ofâ€”â€™

â€˜assuredly,â€™ said the stranger.  â€˜much obliged to you for reminding me.
i am the bearer of a letter of introduction to mr. bounderby, the banker.

dinner ready at the hotel, i asked a fellow whom i met; one of the
working people; who appeared to have been taking a shower-bath of
something fluffy, which i assume to be the raw materialâ€”â€™

the edifice in which i have the honour of offering this explanation?â€™

â€˜no, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, â€˜he does not.â€™

â€˜thank you.  i had no intention of delivering my letter at the present
moment, nor have i. but strolling on to the bank to kill time, and having
the good fortune to observe at the window,â€™ towards which he languidly
waved his hand, then slightly bowed, â€˜a lady of a very superior and
agreeable appearance, i considered that i could not do better than take
the liberty of asking that lady where mr. bounderby the banker _does_
live.  which i accordingly venture, with all s

the inattention and indolence of his manner were sufficiently relieved,
to mrs. sparsitâ€™s thinking, by a certain gallantry at ease, which offered
her homage too.  here he was, for instance, at this moment, all but
sitting on the table, and yet lazily bending over her, as if he
acknowledged an attraction in her that made her charmingâ€”in her way.

â€˜banks, i know, are always suspicious, and officially must be,â€™ said the
stranger, whose lightness and smoothness of speech were pleasant
likewise; suggesting matter far more sensible and humorous than it ever
containedâ€”which was

numerous sect, whosoever may have been that great man: â€˜therefore i may
observe that my letterâ€”here it isâ€”is from the member for this
placeâ€”gradgrindâ€”whom i have had the pleasure of knowing in london.â€™

mrs. sparsit recognized the hand, intimated that such confirmation was
quite unnecessary, and gave mr. bounderbyâ€™s address, with all needful
clues and directions in aid.

â€˜thousand thanks,â€™ said the stranger.  â€˜of course you know the banker
well?â€™

â€˜yes, sir,â€™ rejoined mrs. sparsit.  â€˜in my dependent relation towards
him, i have known him ten years.â€™

â€˜indeed, sir,â€™ said mrs. sparsit.  â€˜_is_ she?â€™

mrs. sparsitâ€™s eyebrows, with a propitiatory air, â€˜but you know the
family, and know the world.  i am about to know the family, and may have
much to do with them.  is the lady so very alarming?  her father gives

desire to know.  is she absolutely unapproachable?  repellently and
stunningly clever?  i see, by your meaning smile, you think not.  you
have poured balm into my anxious soul.  as to age, now.  forty?  five and
thirty?â€™

was married.â€™

â€˜i give you my honour, mrs. powler,â€™ returned the stranger, detaching
himself from the table, â€˜that i never was so astonished in my life!â€™

it really did seem to impress him, to the utmost extent of his capacity
of being impressed.  he looked at his informant for full a quarter of a
minute, and appeared to have the surprise in his mind all the time.  â€˜i

he bowed himself out; and mrs. sparsit, hiding in the window curtain, saw
him languishing down the street on the shady side of the way, observed of
all the town.

â€˜what do you think of the gentleman, bitzer?â€™ she asked the light porter,
when he came to take away.

â€˜spends a deal of money on his dress, maâ€™am.â€™

â€˜it must be admitted,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, â€˜that itâ€™s very tasteful.â€™

â€˜yes, maâ€™am,â€™ returned bitzer, â€˜if thatâ€™s worth the money.â€™

â€˜besides which, maâ€™am,â€™ resumed bitzer, while he was poli

â€˜he looks to me as if he gamed.â€™

â€˜itâ€™s immoral to game,â€™ said mrs. sparsit.

â€˜itâ€™s ridiculous, maâ€™am,â€™ said bitzer, â€˜because the chances are against
the players.â€™

whether it was that the heat prevented mrs. sparsit from working, or
whether it was that her hand was out, she did no work that night.  she
sat at the window, when the sun began to sink behind the smoke; she sat
there, when the smoke was burning red, when the colour faded from it,
when darkness seemed to rise slowly out of the ground, and creep upward,
upward, up to the house-tops, up the church steeple, up to the summits of
the factory chimneys, up to the sky.  without a candle in the room, mrs.
sparsit sat at the window, with her hands before

her, not thinking much
of the sounds of evening; the whooping of boys, the barking of dogs, the
rumbling of wheels, the steps and voices of passengers, the shrill street
cries, the clogs upon the pavement when it was their hour for going by,
the shutting-up of shop-shutters.  not until the light porter announced
that her nocturnal sweetbread was ready, did mrs. sparsit arouse herself
from her reverie, and convey her dense black eyebrowsâ€”by that time
creased with meditation, as if they needed ironing out-up-stairs.

â€˜o, you fool!â€™ said mrs. sparsit, when she was alone at her supper.  whom
she meant, she did not say; but she could scarcely have meant the
sweetbread.



chapter ii
mr. james harthouse


the gradgrind party wanted assistance in cutting the throats of the
graces.  they went about recruiting; and where could they enlist recruits

th a blue-book or two; and his brother put it
about among the hard fact fellows, and said, â€˜if you want to bring in,
for any place, a handsome dog who can make you a devilish good speech,
look after my brother jem, for heâ€™s your man.â€™  after a few dashes in the
public meeting way, mr. gradgrind and a council of political sages
approved of jem, and it was resolved to send him down to coketown, to
become known there and in the neighbourhood.  hence the letter jem had
last night shown to mrs. sparsit, which mr. bounderby now held in his
hand; superscribed, â€˜josiah bounderby, esquire, banker, coketown.
specially to introduce james harthouse, esquire.  thomas gradgrind.â€™

within an hour of the receipt of this dispatch and mr. james harthouseâ€™s
card, mr. bounderby put on his hat and went down to the hotel.  there he
found mr. james harthouse looking out of window, in a state of mind so
disconsolate, that he was already half-disposed to â€˜go inâ€™ for something
else.

can always get on, somehow.â€™

â€˜calling at the bank yesterday evening, for mr. bounderbyâ€™s address, i
found an ancient lady there, who seems to entertain great admiration for
your sister,â€™ observed mr. james harthouse, throwing away the last small
remnant of the cigar he had now smoked out.

â€˜mother sparsit!â€™ said tom.  â€˜what! you have seen her already, have you?â€™

his friend nodded.  tom took his cigar out of his mouth, to shut up his
eye (which had grown rather unmanageable) with the greater expression,
and to tap his nose several times with his finger.

â€˜mother sparsitâ€™s feeling for loo is more than admiration, i should
think,â€™ said tom.  â€˜say affection and devotion.  mother sparsit never set
her cap at bounderby when he was a bachelor.  oh no!â€™

these were the last words spoken

and watched children playing in the street.  some purpose or other is so
natural to every one, that a mere loiterer always looks and feels
remarkable.  when the first hour was out, stephen even began to have an
uncomfortable sensation upon him of being for the time a disreputable
character.

then came the lamplighter, and two lengthening lines of light all down
the long perspective of the street, until they were blended and lost in
the distance.  mrs. sparsit closed the first-floor window, drew down the
blind, and went up-stairs.  presently, a light went up-stairs after her,
passing first the fanlight of the door, and afterwards the two staircase
windows, on its way up.  by and by, one corner of the second-floor blind
was disturbed, as if mrs. sparsitâ€™s eye were there; also the other
corner, as if the light porterâ€™s eye were on that side.  still, no
communication was made to stephen.  much relieved when the two hours were
at last accomplished, h

â€˜i suppose it might.â€™

â€˜suppose it might!  by the lord, you _may_ suppose so.  by george!â€™ said
mr. bounderby, with sundry menacing nods and shakes of his head.  â€˜it
might have been twice twenty.  thereâ€™s no knowing what it would have
been, or wouldnâ€™t have been, as it was, but for the fellowsâ€™ being
disturbed.â€™

louisa had come up now, and mrs. sparsit, and bitzer.

â€˜hereâ€™s tom gradgrindâ€™s daughter knows pretty well what it might have
been, if you donâ€™t,â€™ blustered bounderby.  â€˜dropped, sir, as if she was
shot when i told her!  never knew her do such a thing before.  does her
credit, under the circumstances, in my opinion!â€™

she still looked faint and pale.  james harthouse begged her to take his
arm; and as they moved on very slowly, asked her how the robbery had been
committed.

â€˜i have already had the honourâ€”â€™

â€˜very well.  and this young man, bitzer, you saw him too on the same
occasion?â€™  mr. harthouse inclined his head in assent, and bitzer
knuckled his forehead.

â€˜very well.  they live at the bank.  you know they live at the bank,
perhaps?  very well.  yesterday afternoon, at the close of business
hours, everything was put away as usual.  in the iron room that this

bitzer knuckled his forehead again, in a sneaking manner, and seemed at
once particularly impressed and depressed by the instance last given of
mr. bounderbyâ€™s moral abstinence.

â€˜a hundred and fifty odd pound,â€™ resumed mr. bounderby.  â€˜that sum of
money, young tom locked in his safe, not a very strong safe, but thatâ€™s
no matter now.  everything was left, all right.  some time in the night,
while this young fellow snoredâ€”mrs. sparsit, maâ€™am, you say you have
heard him snore?â€™

â€˜sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, â€˜i cannot say that i have heard him
precisely snore, and therefore must not make that statement.  but on
winter evenings, when he has fallen asleep at his table, i have heard
him, what i should prefer to describe as partially choke.  i have heard
him on such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be
sometimes heard in dutch clocks.  not,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, with a lofty
sense of giving strict

â€˜well!â€™ said the exasperated bounderby, â€˜while he was snoring, _or_
choking, _or_ dutch-clocking, _or_ something _or_ otherâ€”being asleepâ€”some
fellows, somehow, whether previously concealed in the house or not
remains to be seen, got to young tomâ€™s safe, forced it, and abstracted
the contents.  being then disturbed, they made off; letting themselves
out at the main door, and double-locking it again (it was double-locked,
and the key under mrs. sparsitâ€™s pillow) with a false key, which was
picked up in the street near the bank, about twelve oâ€™clock to-day.  no
alarm takes place, till this chap, bitzer, turns out this morning, and
begins to open and prepare the offices for business.  then, looking at
tomâ€™s safe, he sees the door ajar, and finds the lock forced, and the
money gone.â€™

â€˜where is tom, by the by?â€™ asked harthouse, glancing round.

â€˜he has been helping the police,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜and stays behind at

bounderby, relinquishing mrs. sparsitâ€™s arm to wipe his heated head.
â€˜josiah bounderby of coketown is not to be plundered and nobody

might mr. harthouse inquire who was suspected?

â€˜well,â€™ said bounderby, stopping and facing about to confront them all,
â€˜iâ€™ll tell you.  itâ€™s not to be mentioned everywhere; itâ€™s not to be

another of the popular fictions of coketown, which some pains had been
taken to disseminateâ€”and which some people really believed.

i give that fellow, the first time he set foot in the house, when the
express object of his visit was to know how he could knock religion over,
and floor the established church?  mrs. sparsit, in point of high
connexions, you are on a level with the aristocracy,â€”did i say, or did i
not say, to that fellow, â€œyou canâ€™t hide the truth from me: you are not

â€˜yes, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, with a meek shake of her head, â€˜he
certainly did so.  though i do not mean to say but that my feelings may
be weaker on such pointsâ€”more foolish if the term is preferredâ€”than they
might have been, if i had always occupied my present position.â€™

mr. bounderby stared with a bursting pride at mr. harthouse, as much as
to say, â€˜i am the proprietor of this female, and sheâ€™s worth your
attention, i think.â€™  then, resumed his discourse.

â€˜you can recall for yourself, harthouse, what i

three days after that, he bolted.  went off,
nobody knows where: as my mother did in my infancyâ€”only with this
difference, that he is a worse subject than my mother, if possible.  what
did he do before he went?  what do you say;â€™ mr. bounderby, with his hat
in his hand, gave a beat upon the crown at every little division of his
sentences, as if it were a tambourine; â€˜to his being seenâ€”night after
nightâ€”watching the bank?â€”to his lurking about thereâ€”after dark?â€”to its
striking mrs. sparsitâ€”that he could be lurking for no goodâ€”to her calling
bitzerâ€™s attention to him, and their both taking notice of himâ€”and to its
appearing on inquiry to-dayâ€”that he was also noticed by the neighbours?â€™
having come to the climax, mr. bounderby, like an oriental dancer, put
his tambourine on his head.

â€˜suspicious,â€™ said james harthouse, â€˜certainly.â€™

there are more of â€™em in it.  thereâ€™s an old w

fellows who go in for banks must take the consequences.  if there were no
consequences, we should all go in for banks.â€™  he had gently taken
louisaâ€™s parasol from her hand, and had put it up for her; and she walked
under its shade, though the sun did not shine there.

â€˜for the present, loo bounderby,â€™ said her husband, â€˜hereâ€™s mrs. sparsit
to look after.  mrs. sparsitâ€™s nerves have been acted upon by this
business, and sheâ€™ll stay here a day or two.  so make her comfortable.â€™

â€˜thank you very much, sir,â€™ that discreet lady observed, â€˜but pray do not
let my comfort be a consideration.  anything will do for me.â€™

it soon appeared that if mrs. sparsit had a failing in her association
with that domestic establishment, it was that she was so excessively
regardless of herself and regardful of others, as to be a nuisance.

e had made rather formal and public announcement, to â€˜wait for the
simple mutton.â€™  she was likewise deeply apologetic for wanting the salt;
and, feeling amiably bound to bear out mr. bounderby to the fullest
extent in the testimony he had borne to her nerves, occasionally sat back
in her chair and silently wept; at which periods a tear of large
dimensions, like a crystal ear-ring, might be observed (or rather, must
be, for it insisted on public notice) sliding down her roman nose.

but mrs. sparsitâ€™s greatest point, first and last, was her determination
to pity mr. bounderby.  there were occasions when in looking at him she
was involuntarily moved to shake her head, as who would say, â€˜alas, poor
yorick!â€™  after allowing herself to be betrayed into these evidences of
emotion, she would force a lambent brightness, and would be fitfully
cheerful, and would say, â€˜you have still good spirits, sir, i am thankful
to find;â€™ and would appear to hail it as a blessed dispensation that mr.

bounderby bore up as he did.  one idiosyncrasy for which she often
apologized, she found it excessively difficult to conquer.  she had a
curious propensity to call mrs. bounderby â€˜miss gradgrind,â€™ and yielded
to it some three or four score times in the course of the evening.  her
repetition of this mistake covered mrs. sparsit with modest confusion;
but indeed, she said, it seemed so natural to say miss gradgrind:
whereas, to persuade herself that the young lady whom she had had the
happiness of knowing from a child could be really and truly mrs.
bounderby, she found almost impossible.  it was a further singularity of
this remarkable case, that the more she thought about it, the more
impossible it appeared; â€˜the differences,â€™ she observed, â€˜being such.â€™

in the drawing-room after dinner, mr. bounderby tried t

robbery, examined the witnesses, made notes of the evidence, found the
suspected persons guilty, and sentenced them to the extreme punishment of
the law.  that done, bitzer was dismissed to town with instructions to
recommend tom to come home by the mail-train.

when candles were brought, mrs. sparsit murmured, â€˜donâ€™t be low, sir.
pray let me see you cheerful, sir, as i used to do.â€™  mr. bounderby, upon
whom these consolations had begun to produce the effect of making him, in
a bull-headed blundering way, sentimental, sighed like some large
sea-animal.  â€˜i cannot bear to see you so, sir,â€™ said mrs. sparsit.  â€˜try
a hand at backgammon, sir, as you used to do when i had the honour of
living under your roof.â€™  â€˜i havenâ€™t played backgammon, maâ€™am,â€™ said mr.

â€˜i am aware that you have not.  i remember that miss gradgrind takes no
interest in the game.  but i shall be happy, sir, if you will
condescend.â€™

they played near a window, opening on the garden.  it was a fine night:
not moonlight, but sultry and fragrant.  louisa and mr. harthouse
strolled out into the garden, where their voices could be heard in the
stillness, though not what they said.  mrs. sparsit, from her place at
the backgammon board, was constantly straining her eyes to pierce the
shadows without.  â€˜whatâ€™s the matter, maâ€™am?â€™ said mr. bounderby; â€˜you
donâ€™t see a fire, do you?â€™  â€˜oh dear no, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, â€˜i
was thinking of the dew.â€™  â€˜what have you got to do with the dew, maâ€™am?â€™
said mr. bounderby.  â€˜itâ€™s not myself, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, â€˜i am
fearful of miss gradgrindâ€™s taking cold.â€™  â€˜she never takes cold,â€™ said
mr

. bounderby.  â€˜really, sir?â€™ said mrs. sparsit.  and was affected with
a cough in her throat.

when the time drew near for retiring, mr. bounderby took a glass of
water.  â€˜oh, sir?â€™ said mrs. sparsit.  â€˜not your sherry warm, with
lemon-peel and nutmeg?â€™  â€˜why, i have got out of the habit of taking it
now, maâ€™am,â€™ said mr. bounderby.  â€˜the moreâ€™s the pity, sir,â€™ returned
mrs. sparsit; â€˜you are losing all your good old habits.  cheer up, sir!
if miss gradgrind will permit me, i will offer to make it for you, as i
have often done.â€™

miss gradgrind readily permitting mrs. sparsit to do anything she
pleased, that considerate lady made the beverage, and handed it to mr.
bounderby.  â€˜it will do you good, sir.  it will warm your heart.  it is
the sort of thing you want, and ought to take, sir.â€™  and when mr.
bounderby said, â€˜your health, maâ€™am!â€™ she answered with gre

returned to her room.

then the wretched boy looked cautiously up and found her gone, crept out
of bed, fastened his door, and threw himself upon his pillow again:
tearing his hair, morosely crying, grudgingly loving her, hatefully but
impenitently spurning himself, and no less hatefully and unprofitably
spurning all the good in the world.



chapter ix
hearing the last of it


mrs. sparsit, lying by to recover the tone of her nerves in mr.
bounderbyâ€™s retreat, kept such a sharp look-out, night and day, under her
coriolanian eyebrows, that her eyes, like a couple of lighthouses on an
iron-bound coast, might have warned all prudent mariners from that bold
rock her roman nose and the dark and craggy region in its neighbourhood,
but for the placidity of her manner.  although it was hard to believe
that her retiring for the night could be anything but a form, so severely

onstrained to suppose her a dove, embodied by some freak of nature, in
the earthly tabernacle of a bird of the hook-beaked order.

she was a most wonderful woman for prowling about the house.  how she got
from story to story was a mystery beyond solution.  a lady so decorous in
herself, and so highly connected, was not to be suspected of dropping
over the banisters or sliding down them, yet her extraordinary facility
of locomotion suggested the wild idea.  another noticeable circumstance
in mrs. sparsit was, that she was never hurried.  she would shoot with
consummate velocity from the roof to the hall, yet would be in full
possession of her breath and dignity on the moment of her arrival there.
neither was she ever seen by human vision to go at a great pace.

she took very kindly to mr. harthouse, and had some pleasant conversation
with him soon after her arrival.  she made him her stately curtsey in the
garden, one morning before breakfast.

â€˜it appears but yesterday, sir,â€™ said mrs. spa

rsit, â€˜that i had the
honour of receiving you at the bank, when you were so good as to wish to
be made acquainted with mr. bounderbyâ€™s address.â€™

â€˜an occasion, i am sure, not to be forgotten by myself in the course of
ages,â€™ said mr. harthouse, inclining his head to mrs. sparsit with the
most indolent of all possible airs.

â€˜we live in a singular world, sir,â€™ said mrs. sparsit.

â€˜i have had the honour, by a coincidence of which i am proud, to have
made a remark, similar in effect, though not so epigrammatically
expressed.â€™

â€˜a singular world, i would say, sir,â€™ pursued mrs. sparsit; after
acknowledging the compliment with a drooping of her dark eyebrows, not
altogether so mild in its expression as her voice was in its dulcet
tones; â€˜as regards the intimacies we form at one time, with individuals
we were quite ignorant of, at another.  i recall, sir, that on
 
 ___________________________
 
 that
occasion you went so far as to say you were actually apprehensive of miss
gradgrind.â€™

â€˜your memory does me more honour than my insignificance deserves.  i
availed myself of your obliging hints to correct my timidity, and it is
unnecessary to add that they were perfectly accurate.  mrs. sparsitâ€™s
talent forâ€”in fact for anything requiring accuracyâ€”with a combination of
strength of mindâ€”and familyâ€”is too habitually developed to admit of any
question.â€™  he was almost falling asleep over this compliment; it took
him so long to get through, and his mind wandered so much in the course
of its execution.

â€˜you found miss gradgrindâ€”i really cannot call her mrs. bounderby; itâ€™s
very absurd of meâ€”as youthful as i described her?â€™ asked mrs. sparsit,
sweetly.

â€˜you drew her

 portrait perfectly,â€™ said mr. harthouse.  â€˜presented her
dead image.â€™

â€˜very engaging, sir,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, causing her mittens slowly to
revolve over one another.

â€˜highly so.â€™

â€˜it used to be considered,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, â€˜that miss gradgrind was
wanting in animation, but i confess she appears to me considerably and
strikingly improved in that respect.  ay, and indeed here _is_ mr.
bounderby!â€™ cried mrs. sparsit, nodding her head a great many times, as
if she had been talking and thinking of no one else.  â€˜how do you find
yourself this morning, sir?  pray let us see you cheerful, sir.â€™

now, these persistent assuagements of his misery, and lightenings of his
load, had by this time begun to have the effect of making mr. bounderby
softer than usual towards mrs. sparsit, and harder than usual to most
other people from his wife downward.  so, when mrs. sparsit said with
forced lightness of heart, â€˜yo

replied, â€˜if i waited to be taken care of by my wife, maâ€™am, i believe
you know pretty well i should wait till doomsday, so iâ€™ll trouble _you_
to take charge of the teapot.â€™  mrs. sparsit complied, and assumed her
old position at table.

this again made the excellent woman vastly sentimental.  she was so
humble withal, that when louisa appeared, she rose, protesting she never
could think of sitting in that place under existing circumstances, often
as she had had the honour of making mr. bounderbyâ€™s breakfast, before

hoped to be excused, but she really could not get it right yet, though

ved) because miss gradgrind happened to
be a little late, and mr. bounderbyâ€™s time was so very precious, and she
knew it of old to be so essential that he should breakfast to the moment,
that she had taken the liberty of complying with his request; long as his
will had been a law to her.

â€˜there!  stop where you are, maâ€™am,â€™ said mr. bounderby, â€˜stop where you
are!  mrs. bounderby will be very glad to be relieved of the trouble, i
believe.â€™

â€˜donâ€™t say that, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, almost with severity,
â€˜because that is very unkind to mrs. bounderby.  and to be unkind is not
to be you, sir.â€™

â€˜you may set your mind at rest, maâ€™am.â€”you can take it very quietly,
canâ€™t you, loo?â€™ said mr. bounderby, in a blustering way to his wife.

â€˜of course.  it is of no moment.  why should it be of any importance to
me?â€™

â€˜why should it be of any importance to any one, mrs. sparsit, maâ€™am?â€™

she looked at him, as he struck the table and made the teacups ring, with
a proud colour in her face that was a new change, mr. harthouse thought.
â€˜you are incomprehensible this morning,â€™ said louisa.  â€˜pray take no
further trouble to explain yourself.  i am not curious to know your
meaning.  what does it matter?â€™

nothing more was said on this theme, and mr. harthouse was soon idly gay
on indifferent subjects.  but from this day, the sparsit action upon mr.
bounderby threw louisa and james harthouse more together, and
strengthened the dangerous alienation from her husband and confidence
against him with another, into which she had fallen by degrees so fine
that she could not retrace them if she tried.  but whether she ever tried
or no, lay hidden in her own closed heart.

mrs. sparsit was so much affected on this particular occasion, that,

been feeble and dim behind the weak transparency, went out; and even mrs.
gradgrind, emerged from the shadow in which man walketh and disquieteth
himself in vain, took upon her the dread solemnity of the sages and
patriarchs.



chapter x
mrs. sparsitâ€™s staircase


mrs. sparsitâ€™s nerves being slow to recover their tone, the worthy woman
made a stay of some weeks in duration at mr. bounderbyâ€™s retreat, where,
notwithstanding her anchorite turn of mind based upon her becoming
consciousness of her altered station, she resigned herself with noble
fortitude to lodging, as one may say, in clover, and feeding on the fat
of the land.  during the whole term of this recess from the guardianship
of the bank, mrs. sparsit was a pattern of consiste

 to call his portrait a noodle to _its_ face, with the greatest
acrimony and contempt.

mr. bounderby, having got it into his explosive composition that mrs.
sparsit was a highly superior woman to perceive that he had that general
cross upon him in his deserts (for he had not yet settled what it was),
and further that louisa would have objected to her as a frequent visitor
if it had comported with his greatness that she should object to anything
he chose to do, resolved not to lose sight of mrs. sparsit easily.  so
when her nerves were strung up to the pitch of again consuming
sweetbreads in solitude, he said to her at the dinner-table, on the day
before her departure, â€˜i tell you what, maâ€™am; you shall come down here
of a saturday, while the fine weather lasts, and stay till monday.â€™  to
which mrs. sparsit returned, in effect, though not of the mahomedan
persuasion: â€˜to hear is to obey.â€™

now, mrs. sparsit was not a poetical woman; but she took an idea in the
nature of an allegorica

l fancy, into her head.  much watching of louisa,
and much consequent observation of her impenetrable demeanour, which
keenly whetted and sharpened mrs. sparsitâ€™s edge, must have given her as
it were a lift, in the way of inspiration.  she erected in her mind a
mighty staircase, with a dark pit of shame and ruin at the bottom; and
down those stairs, from day to day and hour to hour, she saw louisa
coming.

it became the business of mrs. sparsitâ€™s life, to look up at her
staircase, and to watch louisa coming down.  sometimes slowly, sometimes
quickly, sometimes several steps at one bout, sometimes stopping, never
turning back.  if she had once turned back, it might have been the death
of mrs. sparsit in spleen and grief.

she had been descending steadily, to the day, and on the day, when mr.
bounderby issued the weekly invitation recorded above.  mrs. sparsit was
in good spirits, and inclined to be conversational.

â€˜and pray, sir,â

â€˜why, maâ€™am, no; not yet.  under the circumstances, i didnâ€™t expect it
yet.  rome wasnâ€™t built in a day, maâ€™am.â€™

â€˜very true, sir,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, shaking her head.

â€˜nor yet in a week, maâ€™am.â€™

â€˜no, indeed, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, with a gentle melancholy upon
her.

â€˜in a similar manner, maâ€™am,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜i can wait, you know.  if
romulus and remus could wait, josiah bounderby can wait.  they were
better off in their youth than i was, however.  they had a she-wolf for a

at presentâ€”something new for him; he hadnâ€™t the schooling _i_ hadâ€”is

â€˜very sagacious indeed, sir,â€™ said mrs. sparsit.  â€˜very interesting.  the
old woman you mentioned, sirâ€”â€™

â€˜the old woman i mentioned, maâ€™am,â€™ said bounderby, cutting the matter
short, as it was nothing to boast about, â€˜is not laid hold of; but, she
may take her oath she will be, if that is any satisfaction to her
villainous old mind.  in the mean time, maâ€™am, i am of opinion, if you
ask me my opinion, that the less she is talked about, the better.â€™

the same evening, mrs. sparsit, in her chamber window, resting from her

king operations, looked towards her great staircase and saw louisa
still descending.

she sat by mr. harthouse, in an alcove in the garden, talking very low;
he stood leaning over her, as they whispered together, and his face
almost touched her hair.  â€˜if not quite!â€™ said mrs. sparsit, straining
her hawkâ€™s eyes to the utmost.  mrs. sparsit was too distant to hear a
word of their discourse, or even to know that they were speaking softly,
otherwise than from the expression of their figures; but what they said
was this:

â€˜you recollect the man, mr. harthouse?â€™

â€˜oh, perfectly!â€™

â€˜his face, and his manner, and what he said?â€™

â€˜perfectly.  and an infinitely dreary person he appeared to me to be.

confidence with tomâ€”and he is quite of my opinion, and i am quite of his.
will you walk?â€™

they strolled away, among the lanes beginning to be indistinct in the
twilightâ€”she leaning on his armâ€”and she little thought how she was going
down, down, down, mrs. sparsitâ€™s staircase.

night and day, mrs. sparsit kept it standing.  when louisa had arrived at
the bottom and disappeared in the gulf, it might fall in upon her if it
would; but, until then, there it was to be, a building, before mrs.
sparsitâ€™s eyes.  and there louisa always was, upon it.

and always gliding down, down, down!

mrs. sparsit saw james harthouse come and go; she heard of him here and
there; she saw the changes of the face he had studied; she, too, remarked
to a nicety how and when it

 clouded, how and when it cleared; she kept
her black eyes wide open, with no touch of pity, with no touch of
compunction, all absorbed in interest.  in the interest of seeing her,
ever drawing, with no hand to stay her, nearer and nearer to the bottom
of this new giantâ€™s staircase.

with all her deference for mr. bounderby as contradistinguished from his
portrait, mrs. sparsit had not the smallest intention of interrupting the
descent.  eager to see it accomplished, and yet patient, she waited for
the last fall, as for the ripeness and fulness of the harvest of her
hopes.  hushed in expectancy, she kept her wary gaze upon the stairs; and
seldom so much as darkly shook her right mitten (with her fist in it), at
the figure coming down.

the figure descended the great stairs, steadily, steadily; always
verging, like a weight in deep water,

 to the black gulf at the bottom.

mr. gradgrind, apprised of his wifeâ€™s decease, made an expedition from
london, and buried her in a business-like manner.  he then returned with
promptitude to the national cinder-heap, and resumed his sifting for the
odds and ends he wanted, and his throwing of the dust about into the eyes
of other people who wanted other odds and endsâ€”in fact resumed his
parliamentary duties.

in the meantime, mrs. sparsit kept unwinking watch and ward.  separated
from her staircase, all the week, by the length of iron road dividing
coketown from the country house, she yet maintained her cat-like
observation of louisa, through her husband, through her brother, through
james harthouse, through the outsides of letters and packets, through
everything animate and inanimate that at any time went near the stairs.
â€˜your foot on the last step, my lady,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, apostrophizing
the descending figure, with th

art or nature though, the original stock of louisaâ€™s character or the
graft of circumstances upon it,â€”her curious reserve did baffle, while it
stimulated, one as sagacious as mrs. sparsit.  there were times when mr.
james harthouse was not sure of her.  there were times when he could not
read the face he had studied so long; and when this lonely girl was a
greater mystery to him, than any woman of the world with a ring of
satellites to help her.

so the time went on; until it happened that mr. bounderby was called away
from home by business which required his presence elsewhere, for three or
four days.  it was on a friday that he intimated this to mrs. sparsit at
the bank, addin

youâ€™ll go down just as if i was there.  it will make no difference to
you.â€™

â€˜pray, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, reproachfully, â€˜let me beg you not to
say that.  your absence will make a vast difference to me, sir, as i
think you very well know.â€™

â€˜well, maâ€™am, then you must get on in my absence as well as you can,â€™
said mr. bounderby, not displeased.

â€˜mr. bounderby,â€™ retorted mrs. sparsit, â€˜your will is to me a law, sir;
otherwise, it might be my inclination to dispute your kind commands, not
feeling sure that it will be quite so agreeable to miss gradgrind to
receive me, as it ever is to your own munificent hospitality.  but you
shall say no more, sir.  i will go, upon your invitation.â€™

â€˜why, when i invite you to my house, maâ€™am,â€™ said bounderby, opening his
eyes, â€˜i should hope you want no other invitation.â€™

â€˜no, indeed, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, â€˜i sh

â€˜sir,â€™ rejoined mrs. sparsit, â€˜there was wont to be an elasticity in you
which i sadly miss.  be buoyant, sir!â€™

mr. bounderby, under the influence of this difficult adjuration, backed
up by her compassionate eye, could only scratch his head in a feeble and
ridiculous manner, and afterwards assert himself at a distance, by being
heard to bully the small fry of business all the morning.

usually ready for anything in that way, returned a gracious answer, and
followed on its heels.  â€˜mr. thomas,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, â€˜these plain
viands being on table, i thought you might be tempted.â€™

â€˜thankâ€™ee, mrs. sparsit,â€™ said the whelp.  and gloomily fell to.

â€˜how is mr. harthouse, mr. tom?â€™ asked mrs. sparsit.

â€˜oh, heâ€™s all right,â€™ said tom.

â€˜where may he be at present?â€™ mrs. sparsit asked in a light
conversational manner, after mentally devoting the whelp to the furies
for being so uncommunicative.

â€˜he is shooting in yorkshire,â€™ said tom.  â€˜sent loo a basket half as big
as a church, yesterday.â€™

â€˜the kind of gentleman, now,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, sweetly, â€˜whom one might
wager to be a good shot!â€™

â€˜crack,â€™ said tom.

he had long been a down-looking young fellow, but th

so increased of late, that he never raised his eyes to any face for three
seconds together.  mrs. sparsit consequently had ample means of watching
his looks, if she were so inclined.

â€˜mr. harthouse is a great favourite of mine,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, â€˜as
indeed he is of most people.  may we expect to see him again shortly, mr.
tom?â€™

â€˜why, _i_ expect to see him to-morrow,â€™ returned the whelp.

â€˜good news!â€™ cried mrs. sparsit, blandly.

â€˜i have got an appointment with him to meet him in the evening at the
station here,â€™ said tom, â€˜and i am going to dine with him afterwards, i
believe.  he is not coming down to the country house for a week or so,
being due somewhere else.  at least, he says so; but i shouldnâ€™t wonder
if he was to stop here over sunday, and stray that way.â€™

â€˜which reminds me!â€™ said mrs. sparsit.  â€˜would you remember a message to
your sister, mr. tom, if i was to charge you with one?â€

â€˜it is merely my respectful compliments,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, â€˜and i fear
i may not trouble her with my society this week; being still a little
nervous, and better perhaps by my poor self.â€™

â€˜oh!  if thatâ€™s all,â€™ observed tom, â€˜it wouldnâ€™t much matter, even if i
was to forget it, for looâ€™s not likely to think of you unless she sees
you.â€™

having paid for his entertainment with this agreeable compliment, he
relapsed into a hangdog silence until there was no more india ale left,
when he said, â€˜well, mrs. sparsit, i must be off!â€™ and w

next day, saturday, mrs. sparsit sat at her window all day long looking
at the customers coming in and out, watching the postmen, keeping an eye
on the general traffic of the street, revolving many things in her mind,
but, above all, keeping her attention on her staircase.  the evening
come, she put on her bonnet and shawl, and went quietly out: having her
reasons for hovering in a furtive way about the station by which a
passenger would arrive from yorkshire, and for preferring to peep into it
round pillars and corners, and o

 the bustle was over; and then referred to a posted list of
trains, and took counsel with porters.  that done, he strolled away idly,
stopping in the street and looking up it and down it, and lifting his hat
off and putting it on again, and yawning and stretching himself, and
exhibiting all the symptoms of mortal weariness to be expected in one who
had still to wait until the next train should come in, an hour and forty
minutes hence.

â€˜this is a device to keep him out of the way,â€™ said mrs. sparsit,
starting from the dull office window whence she had watched him last.
â€˜harthouse is with his sister now!â€™

it was the conception of an inspired moment, and she shot off with her
utmost swiftness to work it out.  the station for the country house was
at the opposite end of the town, the time was short, the road not easy;
but she was so quick in pouncing on a disengaged coach, so quick in
darting out of it, producing her money, seizing her ticket, and diving
into the train, that she was born

an overcast september evening, just at nightfall, saw beneath its
drooping eyelids mrs. sparsit glide out of her carriage, pass down the
wooden steps of the little station into a stony road, cross it into a
green lane, and become hidden in a summer-growth of leaves and branches.

she went up to the house, keeping within the shrubbery, and went round
it, peeping between the leaves at the lower windows.  most of them were
open, as they usually were in such warm weather, but there were no lights
yet, and all was silent.  she tried the garden with no better effect.

device to keep the brother away!  there they were yonder, by the felled
tree.

bending low among the dewy grass, mrs. sparsit advanced closer to them.
she drew herself up, and stood behind a tree, like robinson crusoe in his
ambuscade against the savages; so near to them that at a spring, and that
no great one, she could have touched them both.  he was there secretly,

 had not shown himself at the house.  he had come on horseback, and
must have passed through the neighbouring fields; for his horse was tied
to the meadow side of the fence, within a few paces.

â€˜my dearest love,â€™ said he, â€˜what could i do?  knowing you were alone,
was it possible that i could stay away?â€™

â€˜you may hang your head, to make yourself the more attractive; _i_ donâ€™t
know what they see in you when you hold it up,â€™ thought mrs. sparsit;
â€˜but you little think, my dearest love, whose eyes are on you!â€™

that she hung her head, was certain.  she urged him to go away, she
commanded him to go away; but she neither turned her face to him, nor
raised it.  yet it was remarkable that she sat as still as ever the
amiable woman in ambuscade had seen her sit, at any period in her life.
her hands rested in one another, like the hands of a statue; and even her
manner of speaking was not hurried.

. sparsit saw with delight that his
arm embraced her; â€˜will you not bear with my society for a little while?â€™

â€˜not here.â€™

â€˜where, louisa?

â€˜not here.â€™

â€˜but we have so little time to make so much of, and i have come so far,
and am altogether so devoted, and distracted.  there never was a slave at
once so devoted and ill-used by his mistress.  to look for your sunny
welcome that has warmed me into life, and to be received in your frozen
manner, is heart-rending.â€™

â€˜am i to say again,

â€˜no!â€™

â€˜your cruel commands are implicitly to be obeyed; though i am the most

all other women, and to have fallen prostrate at last under the foot of

dearest louisa, i cannot go myself, or let you go, in this hard abuse of
your power.â€™

mrs. sparsit saw him detain her with his encircling arm, and heard him
then and there, within her (mrs. sparsitâ€™s) greedy hearing, tell her how
he loved her, and how she was the stake for which he ardently desired to
play away all that he had in life.  the objects he had lately pursued,
turned worthless beside her; such success as was almost in his grasp, he
flung away from him like the dirt it was, compared with her.  its

 that
she was true to him,â€”the man who had seen how cast away she was, whom she
had inspired at their first meeting with an admiration, an interest, of
which he had thought himself incapable, whom she had received into her
confidence, who was devoted to her and adored her.  all this, and more,
in his hurry, and in hers, in the whirl of her own gratified malice, in
the dread of being discovered, in the rapidly increasing noise of heavy
rain among the leaves, and a thunderstorm rolling upâ€”mrs. sparsit
received into her mind, set off with such an unavoidable halo of
confusion and indistinctness, that when at length he climbed the fence
and led his horse away, she was not sure where they were to meet, or
when, except that they had said it was to be that night.

but one of them yet remained in the darkness before her; and while she
tracked that one she must be right.  â€˜oh, my dearest love,â€™ thought mrs.
sparsit, â€˜you little think how well attended you are!â€™

mrs. sparsit saw her out of 
 
 ___________________________
 
the wood, and saw her enter the house.  what
to do next?  it rained now, in a sheet of water.  mrs. sparsitâ€™s white
stockings were of many colours, green predominating; prickly things were
in her shoes; caterpillars slung themselves, in hammocks of their own
making, from various parts of her dress; rills ran from her bonnet, and
her roman nose.  in such condition, mrs. sparsit stood hidden in the
density of the shrubbery, considering what next?

lo, louisa coming out of the house!  hastily cloaked and muffled, and
stealing away.  she elopes!  she falls from the lowermost stair, and is
swallowed up in the gulf.

indifferent to the rain, and moving with a quick determined step, she
struck into a side-path parallel with the ride.  mrs. sparsit followed in
the shadow of the trees, at but a short distance; for it was not easy to
keep a figure in view going quickly through
 
 ___________________________
 
 the umbrageous darkness.

when she stopped to close the side-gate without noise, mrs. sparsit
stopped.  when she went on, mrs. sparsit went on.  she went by the way
mrs. sparsit had come, emerged from the green lane, crossed the stony
road, and ascended the wooden steps to the railroad.  a train for
coketown would come through presently, mrs. sparsit knew; so she
understood coketown to be her first place of destination.

in mrs. sparsitâ€™s limp and streaming state, no extensive precautions were
necessary to change her usual appearance; but, she stopped under the lee
of the station wall, tumbled her shawl into a new shape, and put it on
over her bonnet.  so disguised she had no fear of being recognized when
she followed up the railroad steps, and paid her money in the small
office.  louisa sat waiting in a corner.  mrs. sparsit sat waiting in
another corner.  both listened to the thunder, which was loud, and to the
rain, as it

arches.  two or three lamps were rained out and blown out; so, both saw

to a complaint of the heart, announced the train.  fire and steam, and
smoke, and red light; a hiss, a crash, a bell, and a shriek; louisa put
into one carriage, mrs. sparsit put into another: the little station a
desert speck in the thunderstorm.

though her teeth chattered in her head from wet and cold, mrs. sparsit
exulted hugely.  the figure had plunged down the precipice, and she felt
herself, as it were, attending on the body.  could she, who had been so
active in the getting up of the funeral triumph, do less than exult?
â€˜she will be at coketown long before him,â€™ thought mrs. sparsit, â€˜though
his horse is never so good.  where will she wait for him?  an

occasioned infinite confusion, when the train stopped
at its destination.  gutters and pipes had burst, drains had overflowed,
and streets were under water.  in the first instant of alighting, mrs.
sparsit turned her distracted eyes towards the waiting coaches, which
were in great request.  â€˜she will get into one,â€™ she considered, â€˜and
will be away before i can follow in another.  at all risks of being run
over, i must see the number, and hear the order given to the coachman.â€™

but, mrs. sparsit was wrong in her calculation.  louisa got into no
coach, and was already gone.  the black eyes kept upon the
railroad-carriage in which she had travelled, settled upon it a moment
too late.  the door not being opened after several minutes, mrs. sparsit
passed it and repassed it, saw nothing, looked in, and found it empty.

damp impressions of every button, string, and hook-and-eye she wore,
printed off upon her highly connected back; with a stagnant verdure on
her general exterior, such as accumulates on an old park fence in a

bitterness and say, â€˜i have lost her!â€™

others he would not have owned to on any account, and the only one that

the indefatigable mrs. sparsit, with a violent cold upon her, her voice
reduced to a whisper, and her stately frame so racked by continual
sneezes that it seemed in danger of dismemberment, gave chase to her
patron until she found him in the metropolis; and there, majestically
sweeping in upon him at his hotel in st. jamesâ€™s street, exploded the
combustibles with which she was charged, and blew up.  having executed
her mission with infinite relish, this high-minded woman then fainted
away on mr. bounderbyâ€™s coat-collar.

mr. bounderbyâ€™s first procedure was to shake mrs. sparsit off, and leave
her to progress as she might through various stages of suffering on the
floor.  he next had recourse to the administration of potent
restoratives, such as screwing the patientâ€™s thumbs, smiting her hands,

these attentions had recovered her (which they speedily did), he hustled
her into a fast train without offering any other refreshment, and carried
her back to coketown more dead than alive.

ssical ruin, mrs. sparsit was an interesting spectacle
on her arrival at her journeyâ€™s end; but considered in any other light,
the amount of damage she had by that time sustained was excessive, and
impaired her claims to admiration.  utterly heedless of the wear and tear
of her clothes and constitution, and adamant to her pathetic sneezes, mr.
bounderby immediately crammed her into a coach, and bore her off to stone
lodge.

room late at nigh

sparsitâ€”who has something to say to you that will strike you dumb.â€™

â€˜you have missed my letter!â€™ exclaimed mr. gradgrind, surprised by the
apparition.

â€˜missed your letter, sir!â€™ bawled bounderby.  â€˜the present time is no
time for letters.  no man shall talk to josiah bounderby of coketown
about letters, with his mind in the state itâ€™s in now.â€™

â€˜bounderby,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, in a tone of temperate remonstrance, â€˜i
speak of a very special letter i have

 written to you, in reference to
louisa.â€™

â€˜tom gradgrind,â€™ replied bounderby, knocking the flat of his hand several
times with great vehemence on the table, â€˜i speak of a very special
messenger that has come to me, in reference to louisa.  mrs. sparsit,
maâ€™am, stand forward!â€™

that unfortunate lady hereupon essaying to offer testimony, without any
voice and with painful gestures expressive of an inflamed throat, became
so aggravating and underwent so many facial contortions, that mr.
bounderby, unable to bear it, seized her by the arm and shook her.

â€˜if you canâ€™t get it out, maâ€™am,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜leave _me_ to get it
out.  this is not a time for a lady, however highly connected, to be
totally inaudible, and seemingly swallow

ntroducing to you, louisa hurried here,
for protection.  i myself had not been at home many hours, when i
received herâ€”here, in this room.  she hurried by the train to town, she
ran from town to this house, through a raging storm, and presented
herself before me in a state of distraction.  of course, she has remained
here ever since.  let me entreat you, for your own sake and for hers, to
be more quiet.â€™

mr. bounderby silently gazed about him for some moments, in every
direction except mrs. sparsitâ€™s direction; and then, abruptly turning
upon the niece of lady scadgers, said to that wretched woman:

â€˜now, maâ€™am!  we shall be happy to hear any little apology you may think
proper to offer, for going about the country at express pace, with no
other luggage than a cock-and-a-bull, maâ€™am!â€™

and my health is at present too much impaired, in your service, to admit
of my doing more than taking refuge in tear

 them past the door, and they were
going straight towards it.  some train had newly arrived in coketown,
which had put a number of vehicles in motion, and scattered a
considerable bustle about the town.  several coaches were rattling before
them and behind them as they approached mr. bounderbyâ€™s, and one of the
latter drew up with such briskness as they were in the act of passing the
house, that they looked round involuntarily.  the bright gaslight over
mr. bounderbyâ€™s steps showed them mrs. sparsit in the coach, in an
ecstasy of excitement, struggling to open the door; mrs. sparsit seeing
them at the same moment, called to them to stop.

â€˜itâ€™s a coincidence,â€™ exclaimed mrs. sparsit, as she was released by the
coachman.  â€˜itâ€™s a providence!  come out, maâ€™am!â€™ then said mrs. sparsit,
to some one inside, â€˜come out, or weâ€™ll have you dragged out!â€™

hereupon, no other than the mysterious old woman descended.  whom mrs.
sparsit incontinently collared.

â€˜leave her alone, ev

â€˜let nobody touch her.  she belongs to me.  come in, maâ€™am!â€™ then said
mrs. sparsit, reversing her former word of command.  â€˜come in, maâ€™am, or
weâ€™ll have you dragged in!â€™

the spectacle of a matron of classical deportment, seizing an ancient
woman by the throat, and hauling her into a dwelling-house, would have
been under any circumstances, sufficient temptation to all true english
stragglers so blest as to witness it, to force a way into that
dwelling-house and see the matter out.  but when the phenomenon was
enhanced by the notoriety and mystery by this time associa

the town with the bank robbery, it would have lured the stragglers in,
with an irresistible attraction, though the roof had been expected to
fall upon their heads.  accordingly, the chance witnesses on the ground,
consisting of the busiest of the neighbours to the number of some
five-and-twenty, closed in after sissy and rachael, as they closed in
after mrs. sparsit and her prize; and the whole body made a disorderly
irruption into mr. bounderbyâ€™s dining-room, where the people behind lost
not a momentâ€™s time in mounting on the chairs, to get the better of the
people in front.

â€˜fetch mr. bounderby down!â€™ cried mrs. sparsit.  â€˜rachael, young woman;
you know who this is?â€™

â€˜itâ€™s mrs. pegler,â€™ said rachael.

â€˜i should think it is!â€™ cried mrs. sparsit, exulting.  â€˜fetch mr.
bounderby.  stand away, everybody!â€™  here old mrs. pegler, mu

herself up, and shrinking from observation, whispered a word of entreaty.
â€˜donâ€™t tell me,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, aloud.  â€˜i have told you twenty
times, coming along, that i will _not_ leave you till i have handed you
over to him myself.â€™

mr. bounderby now appeared, accompanied by mr. gradgrind and the whelp,
with whom he had been holding conference up-stairs.  mr. bounderby looked
more astonished than hospitable, at sight of this uninvited party in his
dining-room.

â€˜why, whatâ€™s the matter now!â€™ said he.  â€˜mrs. sparsit, maâ€™am?â€™

â€˜sir,â€™ explained that worthy woman, â€˜i trust it is my

not been, sir, without some trouble that i have effected this; but
trouble in your service is to me a pleasure, and hunger, thirst, and cold
a real gratification.â€™

here mrs. sparsit ceased; for mr. bounderbyâ€™s visage exhibited an
extraordinary combination of all possible colours and expressions of
discomfiture, as old mrs. pegler was disclosed to his view.

â€˜why, what do you mean by this?â€™ was his highly unexpected demand, in
great warmth.  â€˜i ask you, what do you mean by this, mrs. sparsit,
maâ€™am?â€™

â€˜sir!â€™ exclaimed mrs. sparsit, faintly.

â€˜why donâ€™t you mind your own business, maâ€™am?â€™ roared bounderby.  â€˜how

this allusion to her favourite feature overpowered mrs. sparsit.  she sat
down stiffly in a chair, as if she were frozen; and with a fixed stare at
mr. bounderby, slowly grated her mittens against one another, as if they
were frozen too.

â€˜my dear josiah!â€™ cried mrs. pegler, trembling.  â€˜my darling boy!  i am
not to blame.  itâ€™s not my fault, josiah.  i told this lady over and over
again, that i knew she was doing what would not be agreeable to you, but
she would do it.â€™

who had built his windy reputation upon lies, and
in his boastfulness had put the honest truth as far away from him as if
he had advanced the mean claim (there is no meaner) to tack himself on to
a pedigree, he cut a most ridiculous figure.  with the people filing off
at the door he held, who he knew would carry what had passed to the whole
town, to be given to the four winds, he could not have looked a bully
more shorn and forlorn, if he had had his ears cropped.  even that
unlucky female, mrs. sparsit, fallen from her pinnacle of exultation into
the slough of despond, was not in so bad a plight as that remarkable man
and self-made humbug, josiah bounderby of coketown.

rachael and sissy, leaving mrs. pegler to occupy a bed at her sonâ€™s for
that night, walked together to the gate of stone lodge and there parted.
mr. gradgrind joined them before they had gone very far, and spoke with
much interest of stephen blackpool; for whom he thought this signal

chapter ix
final


it is a dangerous thing to see anything in the sphere of a vain
blusterer, before the vain blusterer sees it himself.  mr. bounderby felt
that mrs. sparsit had audaciously anticipated him, and presumed to be
wiser than he.  inappeasably indignant with her for her triumphant
discovery of mrs. pegler, he turned this presumption, on the part of a
woman in her dependent position, over and over in his mind, until it
accumulated with turning like a great snowball.  at last he made the
discovery that to discharge this highly connected femaleâ€”to have it in
his power to say, â€˜she was a woman of family, and wanted to stick to me,
but i wouldnâ€™t have i

t, and got rid of herâ€™â€”would be to get the utmost
possible amount of crowning glory out of the connection, and at the same
time to punish mrs. sparsit according to her deserts.

filled fuller than ever, with this great idea, mr. bounderby came in to
lunch, and sat himself down in the dining-room of former days, where his
portrait was.  mrs. sparsit sat by the fire, with her foot in her cotton
stirrup, little thinking whither she was posting.

since the pegler affair, this gentlewoman had covered her pity for mr.
bounderby with a veil of quiet melancholy and contrition.  in virtue
thereof, it had become her habit to assume a woful look, which woful look
she now bestowed upon her patron.

â€˜whatâ€™s the matter now, maâ€™am?â€™ said mr. bounderby, in a very short,
rough way.

â€˜pray, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, â€˜do not bite my nose of
 
 ___________________________
 
f.â€™

â€˜bite your nose off, maâ€™am?â€™ repeated mr. bounderby.  â€˜_your_ nose!â€™
meaning, as mrs. sparsit conceived, that it was too developed a nose for
the purpose.  after which offensive implication, he cut himself a crust
of bread, and threw the knife down with a noise.

mrs. sparsit took her foot out of her stirrup, and said, â€˜mr. bounderby,
sir!â€™

â€˜well, maâ€™am?â€™ retorted mr. bounderby.  â€˜what are you staring at?â€™

â€˜may i ask, sir,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, â€˜have you been ruffled this
morning?â€™

â€˜yes, maâ€™am.â€™

â€˜may i inquire, sir,â€™ pursued the injured woman, â€˜whether _i_ am the
unfortunate cause of your having lost your temper?â€™

â€˜now, iâ€™ll tell you what, maâ€™am,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜i am not come here to
be bullied.  a female may be highly connected, but she canâ€™t be permitted
to bother and badger a man in my position, and i am not going to put up
with it.â€™  (mr. bounderby felt it necessary to get on: foreseeing that

mrs. sparsit first elevated, then knitted, her coriolanian eyebrows;
gathered up her work into its proper basket; and rose.

â€˜sir,â€™ said she, majestically.  â€˜it is apparent to me that i am in your
way at present.  i will retire to my own apartment.â€™

â€˜allow me to open the door, maâ€™am.â€™

â€˜thank you, sir; i can do it for myself.â€™

â€˜you had better allow me, maâ€™am,â€™ said bounderby, passing her, and
getting his hand upon the lock; â€˜because i can take the opportunity of
saying a word to

you, before you go.  mrs. sparsit, maâ€™am, i rather think
you are cramped here, do you know?  it appears to me, that, under my
humble roof, thereâ€™s hardly opening enough for a lady of your genius in
other peopleâ€™s affairs.â€™

mrs. sparsit gave him a look of the darkest scorn, and said with great
politeness, â€˜really, sir?â€™

â€˜i have been thinking it over, you see, since the late affairs have
happened, maâ€™am,â€™ said bounderby; â€˜and it appears to my poor judgmentâ€”â€™

â€˜oh!  pray, sir,â€™ mrs. sparsit interposed, with sprightly cheerfulness,
â€˜donâ€™t disparage your judgment.  everybody knows how unerring mr.
bounderbyâ€™s judgment is.  everybody has had proofs of it.  it must be the
theme of general conversation.  di

sparage anything in yourself but your
judgment, sir,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, laughing.

mr. bounderby, very red and uncomfortable, resumed:

â€˜it appears to me, maâ€™am, i say, that a different sort of establishment
altogether would bring out a lady of _your_ powers.  such an
establishment as your relation, lady scadgersâ€™s, now.  donâ€™t you think
you might find some affairs there, maâ€™am, to interfere with?â€™

â€˜it never occurred to me before, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit; â€˜but now
you mention it, should think it highly probable.â€™

â€˜then suppose you try, maâ€™am,â€™ said bounderby, laying an envelope with a
cheque in it in her little basket.  â€˜you can take your own time for
going, maâ€™am; but perhaps in the meanwhile, it will be more agreeable to
a lady of your powers of mind, to eat her meals by herself, and not to be
intruded upon.  i really ought to apologise to youâ€”being only josiah
bounderby of coketownâ€”for having stood in your light so long.â€

â€˜pray donâ€™t name it, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit.  â€˜if that portrait
could speak, sirâ€”but it has the advantage over the original of not
possessing the power of committing itself and disgusting others,â€”it would
testify, that a long period has elapsed since i first habitually
addressed it as the picture of a noodle.  nothing that a noodle does, can
awaken surprise or indignation; the proceedings of a noodle can only
inspire contempt.â€™

thus saying, mrs. sparsit, with her roman features like a medal struck to
commemorate her scorn of mr. bounderby, surveyed him fixedly from head to
foot, swept disdainfully past him, and ascended the staircase.  mr.
bounderby closed the door, and stood before the fire; projecting himself
after his old explosive manner into his portraitâ€”and into futurity.
