her.

        "you take no notice of the other girl," said my friend. i turned, and there stood my ellen! i pressed her to my heart, then held her away from me to take a look at her. she had changed a good deal in the two years since i parted from her. signs of neglect could be discerned by eyes less observing than a mother's. my friend invited us all to go into the house; but ellen said she had been sent of an errand, which she would do as quickly as possible, and go

home and ask mrs. hobbs to let her come and see me. it was agreed that i should send for her the next day. her companion, sarah, hastened to tell her mother of my arrival. when i entered the house, i found the mistress of it absent, and i waited for her return. before i saw her, i heard her saying, "where is linda brent? i used to know her father and mother." soon sarah came with her mother. so there was quite a company of us, all from my grandmother's neighborhood. these friends gathered round me and questioned me ea

gerly. they laughed, they cried, and they shouted. they thanked god that i had got away from my persecutors and was safe on long island. it was a day of great excitement. how different from the silent days i had passed in my dreary den!

        the next morning was sunday. my first waking thoughts were occupied with the note i was to send to mrs. hobbs, the lady with whom ellen lived. that i had recently come into that vicinity was evident; otherwise i should have sooner inquired for my daughter. it would not do to let them know i had just arrived from the south, for that would involve the suspicion of my having been harbored there, and might bring trouble, if not ruin, on several people.

ery. it was that system of violence and wrong which now left me no alternative but to enact a falsehood. i began my note by stating that i had recently arrived from canada, and was very desirous to have my

page 252
daughter come to see me. she came and brought a message from mrs. hobbs, inviting me to her house, and assuring me that i need not have any fears. the conversation i had with my child did not leave my mind at ease. when i asked if she was well treated, she answered yes; but there was no heartiness in the tone, and it seemed to me that she said it from an unwillingness to have me troubled on her account. before she left me, she asked very earnestly, "mother, when will you take me to live with you?" it made me sad to think that i could not give her a home till i went

 to work and earned the means; and that might take me a long time. when she was placed with mrs. hobbs, the agreement was that she should be sent to school. she had been there two years, and was now nine years old, and she scarcely knew her letters. there was no excuse for this, for there were good public schools in brooklyn, to which she could have been sent without expense.

        she staid with me till dark, and i went home with her. i was received in a friendly manner by the family, and all agreed in saying that ellen was a useful, good girl. mrs. hobbs looked me coolly in the face, and sa

id, "i suppose you know that my cousin, mr. sands, has given her to my eldest daughter. she will make a nice waiting-maid for her when she grows up." i did not answer a word. how could she, who knew by experience the strength of a mother's love, and who was perfectly aware of the relation mr. sands bore to my children,â€”how could she look me in the face, while she thrust such a dagger into my heart?

        i was no longer surprised that they had kept her in such a state of ignorance. mr. hobbs had formerly

page 253
been wealthy, but he had failed, and afterwards obtained a subordinate situation in the custom house. perhaps they expected to return to the south some day; and ellen's knowledge was quite sufficient for a slave's condition. i was impatient to go to work and earn money, that i might change the uncertain position of my children. mr. sands had not kept his promise to emancipate them. i had also been deceived about ellen. what security had i with regard to benjamin? i felt t

        the old feeling of insecurity, especially with regard to my children, often threw its dark shadow across my sunshine. mrs. bruce offered me a home for ellen; but pleasant as it would have been, i did not dare to accept it, for fear of offending the hobbs family. their knowledge of my precarious situation placed me in their power; and i felt that it was important for me to keep on the right side of them, till, by dint of labor and economy, i could make a home for my children.

had an inflammation of the eyes, occasioned by measles. this disease still troubled her; and kind mrs. bruce proposed that she should come to new york for a while, to be under the care of dr. elliott, a well known oculist. it did not occur to me that there was any thing improper in a mother's making such a request; but mrs. hobbs was very angry, and refused to let her go. situated as i was, it was not politic to insist upon it. i made no complaint, but i longed to be entirely free to act a mother's part towards my children. the next time i went over to brooklyn, mrs. hobbs, as if to apologize for her anger, told me she had employed her own physician to attend to ellen's eyes, and that she had refused my request because she did not consider it safe to trust her in new york. i accepted the explanation in silence; but she

        we soon returned to new york, to make arrangements for spending the remainder of the summer at rockaway. while the laundress was putting the clothes in order, i took an opportunity to go over to brooklyn to see ellen. i met her going to a grocery store, and the first words she said, were, "o, mother, don't go to mrs. hobbs's. her brother, mr. thorne, has come from the south, and may be he'll tell where you are." i accepted the warning. i told her i was going away with mrs. bruce the next day, and would try to see her when i came back.

        being in servitude to the anglo-saxon race, i was not put into a "jim crow car," on our way to rockaway, neither was i invited to ride through the streets on the top of trunks in a truck; but every where i found the same manifestations of that cruel prejudice, which so disc

the hairbreadth escape.

        after we returned to new york, i took the earliest opportunity to go and see ellen. i asked to have her called down stairs; for i supposed mrs. hobbs's southern brother might still be there, and i was desirous to avoid seeing him, if possible. but mrs. hobbs came to the kitchen, and insisted on my going up stairs. "my brother wants to see you," said she, "and he is sorry you seem to shun him. he knows you are living in new york. he told me to say to you that he owes thanks to good old aunt martha for too many little acts of kindness for him to be base enough to betray her grandchild."

roubles; but a mother's observing eye easily perceived that she was not happy. on the occasion of one of my visits i found her unusually serious. when i asked her what was the matter, she said nothing was the matter. but i insisted upon knowing what made her look so very grave. finally, i ascertained that she felt troubled about the dissipation that was continually going on in the house. she was sent to the store very often for rum and brandy, and she felt ashamed to ask for it so often, and mr. hobbs and mr. thorne drank a great deal, and their hands trembled so that they had to call her to pour out the liquor for them. "but for all that," said she, "mr. hobbs is good to me, and i can't help liking him. i feel sorry for him." i tried to comfort her, by telling her that i had laid up a hundred dollars, and that before long i hoped to be able to give her and benjamin a home, and send them to school. she was always desirous not to add to my troubles more than she could help, and i did not disc

nnoyance she suffered from him. though he professed too much gratitude to my grandmother to injure any of her descendants, he had poured vile language into the ears of her innocent great-grandchild.

        i usually went to brooklyn to spend sunday afternoon. one sunday, i found ellen anxiously waiting for me near the house. "o, mother," said she, "i've

page 270
been waiting for you this long time. i'm afraid mr. thorne has written to tell dr. flint where you are. make haste and come in. mrs. hobbs will tell you all about it!"

        the story was soon told. while the children were playing in the grape-vine arbor, the day before, mr. thorne came out with a letter in his hand, which he tore up and scattered about. ellen was sweeping the yard at the time, and having her mind full of suspicions of him, she picked up the pieces and carried them to the children, saying, "i wonder who mr. thorne has been writing to."

        "i'm sure i don't know, and don't care," replied the oldest of the

lieve you are right."

        the contents of mr. thorne's letter, as nearly as i can remember, were as follows: "i have seen your slave, linda, and conversed with her. she can be taken very easily, if you manage prudently. there are enough of us here to swear to her identity as your property. i am a patriot, a lover of my country, and i do this as an act of justice to the laws." he concluded by informing the doctor of the street and number where i lived. the children carried the pieces to mrs. hobbs, who immediately went to her brother's

if the case came to trial. mrs. bruce took me in a carriage to the house of one of her friends, where she assured me i should be safe until my brother could arrive, which would be in a few days. in the interval my thoughts were much occupied with ellen. she was mine by birth, and she was also mine by southern law, since my grandmother held the bill of sale that made her so. i did not feel that she was safe unless i had her with me. mrs. hobbs, who felt badly about her brother's treachery, yielded to my entreaties, on condition that she should return in ten days. i avoided making any promise. she came to me clad in very thin garments, all outgrown, and with a school satchel on her arm, containing a few articles. it was late in october, and i knew the child must suffer; and not daring to go out in the streets to purchase any thing, i took off my own flannel skirt and converted it into one for her. kind mrs. bruce came to bid me good b

 the day after my arrival was one of the happiest of my life. i felt as if i was beyond the reach of the bloodhounds; and, for the first time during many years, i had both my children together with me. they greatly enjoyed their reunion, and laughed and chatted merrily. i watched them with a swelling heart. their every motion delighted me.

        i could not feel safe in new york, and i accepted the offer of a friend, that we should share expenses and keep house together. i represented to mrs. hobbs that ellen must have some schooling, and must remain with me for that purpose. she felt ashamed of being unable to read or spell at her age, so instead of sending her to school with benny, i instructed her myself till she was fitted to enter an intermediate school. the winter passed pleasantly, while i was busy with my needle, and my children with their books.
