[CHARACTER]
in contrast to jurgis and her stepdaughter ona, teta elzbieta
is not young; she is a mother of six living children and is nearing
old age at the start of the novel. where jurgis has energy, teta
elzbieta has inner strength; where he has faith in his work ethic,
she has a commitment to her home and family. throughout the novel,
she represents the strength of family and traditions of the old
country. for this reason, as the novel progresses, teta elzbieta
gradually emerges as one of its strongest and most important characters.
forced to endure innumerable privations, from the disappearance
of her brother jonas to the deaths of two of her own children and
her stepdaughter ona, teta elzbieta remains steady and strong. she
is willing to work when the family needs her to, but her real place
is in the home, and her transition into the world outside it represents another
powerful blow to the family. at the end of the novel, however, she
has quietly weathered the worst of the storm and is able to survive
with the fragments of her family around her. pragmatic rather than
stubborn, she accepts jurgis back into the family after his long
abandonment because he can provide for the family. her experiences
dealing with adversity have molded her outlook such that she judges
jurgis and his new socialist politics based on his and their immediate
benefit to the family.
