[CHARACTER] - 
                 though
he never appears in the novel, and though he may not actually exist,
[CHARACTER], the perceived ruler of oceania, is an extremely important
figure. everywhere winston looks he sees posters of [CHARACTER]'s
face bearing the message "[CHARACTER] is watching you." big
brother's image is stamped on coins and broadcast on the unavoidable
telescreens; it haunts winston's life and fills him with hatred
and fascination.
