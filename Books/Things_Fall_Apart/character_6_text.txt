were an offense on the land and must be
destroyed. and if the clan did not exact punishment for an offense
against the great goddess, her wrath was loosed on all the land and
not just on the offender. as the elders said, if one finger brought
oil it soiled the others.





part two

chapter fourteen





okonkwo was well received by his mother's kinsmen in mbanta.
the old man who received him was his mother's younger brother,
who was now the eldest surviving member of that family. his
name was uchendu, and it was he who had received okonkwo's
mother twenty and ten years before when she had been brought
home irom umuofia to be buried with her people. okonkwo was
only a boy then and uchendu still remembered him crying the
traditional farewell: "mother, mother, mother is going."

that was many years ago. today okonkwo was not bringing his
mother home to be buried with her people. he was taking his
family of three wives and their children to seek refuge in his
motherland. as soon as uchendu saw

story. the old man listened silently to the end and then said with
some relief: "it is a female ochu." and he arranged the requisite
rites and sacrifices.

okonkwo was given a plot of ground on which to build his
compound, and two or three pieces of land on which to

farm during the coming planting season. with the help of his
mother's kinsmen he built himself an obi and three huts for his
wives. he then installed his personal god and the symbols of his
departed fathers. each of uchendu's five sons contributed three
hundred seed-yams to enable their cousin to plant a farm, for as
soon as the first rain came farming would begin.

at last the rain came. it was sudden and tremendous. for two or
three moons the sun had been gathering strength till it seemed to
breathe a breath of fire on the earth. all the grass had long been
scorched brown, and the sands felt like live coals to the feet.
evergreen trees wore a dusty coat of brown. the birds were
silenced in the forests, and the w

sion—to become one of the
lords of the clan. that had been his life-spring. and he had all but
achieved it. then everything had been broken. he had been cast
out of his clan like a fish onto a dry, sandy beach, panting. clearly
his personal god or chi was not made for great things. a man could
not rise beyond the destiny of his chi. the saying of the elders was
not true—that if a man said yea his chi also affirmed. here was a
man whose chi said nay despite his own affirmation.

the old man, uchendu, saw clearly that okonkwo had yielded to
despair and he was greatly troubled. he would speak to him after
the isa-ifi ceremony.



the youngest of uchendu's five sons, amikwu, was marrying a
new wife. the bride-price had been paid and all but the last
ceremony had been performed. amikwu and his people had taken
palm-wine to the bride's kinsmen about two moons before
okonkwo's arrival in mbanta. and so it was time for the final
ceremony of confession.



the daughters of the family were all the

come a long way from their homes in distant villages. uchendu's
eldest daughter had come from obodo, nearly half a day's journey
away. the daughters of uehuiona were also there. it was a full
gathering of umuada, in the same way as they would meet if a
death occurred . there were twenty-two of them.

they sat in a big circle on the ground and the young bride in the
center with a hen in her right hand. uchendu before her, holding
the ancestral staff of the family. the men stood outside the circle,
watching. their wives also. it was evening and the sun was setting

uchendu's eldest daughter, njide, asked her"

"remember that if you do not answer truthfully you will suffer or
even die at childbirth," she began. "how man men have lain with
you since my brother first expressed his desire to marry you?"

"none," she answered simply.

"answer truthfully," urged the other women

"none?" asked njide.

"none,

" she answered.

"swear on this staff of my fathers," said uchendu

"i swear," said the bride.



uchendu took the hen from her, slit its throat with a sharp knife
and allowed some of the blood to fall on the ancestral staff.



from that day amikwu took the young bride and she became his
wife. the daughters of the clan did not return to their homes
immediately but spent two more days with their kinsmen.



on the second day uchendu called together his sons and daughters
and his nephew, okonkwo. the men brought their goatskin mats,
with which they sat on the floor, and the women sat on a sisal mat
spread on a raised bank of earth. uchendu pulled gently at his gray
beard and gnashed his teeth. then he began to speak, quietly and
deliberately, picking his words with great care:

"it is okonkwo that 1 primarily wish to speak to," he began. "but i
want all of you to note what 1 am going to say. i am an old man
and you are all

ust one question i would like to ask
him. can you tell me, okonkwo, why it is that one of the
commonest names we give our children is nneka, or "mother is
supreme?" we all know that a man is the head of the family and
his wives do his bidding. a child belongs to its father and his
family and not to its mother and her family. a man belongs to his
fatherland and not to his motherland. and yet we say nneka -
'mother is supreme.' why is that?"

there was silence. "1 want okonkwo to answer me," said uchendu.



"i do not know the answer," okonkwo replied.



"you do not know the answer? so you see that you are a child.
you have many wives and many children—more children than i
have. you are a great man in your clan. but you are still a child,
my child. listen to me and i shall tell you. but there is one more
question i shall ask you. why is it that when a woman dies she is
taken home to be buried with her own kinsmen? she is not buried
with her husband's kinsmen. why is that? your mother was
br

ought home to me and buried with my people. why was that?"

okonkwo shook his head.

"he does not know that either," said uchendu, "and yet he is full of
sorrow because he has come to live in his motherland for a few
years." he laughed a mirthless laughter, and turned to his sons and
daughters. "what about you? can you answer my question?"

they all shook their heads.

"then listen to me," he said and cleared his throat. "it's true that a
child belongs to its father. but when a father beats his child, it
seeks sympathy in its mother's hut. a man belongs to his
fatherland when things are good and life is sweet. but when th

it was clear that the bags were full of cowries.

okonkwo was very happy to receive his friend. his wives and
children were very happy too, and so were his cousins and their
wives when he sent for them and told them who his guest was.

"you must take him to salute our father," said one of the cousins.

"yes," replied okonkwo. "we are going directly." but before they
went he whispered something to his first wife. she nodded, and
soon the children were chasing one of their cocks.

uchendu had been told by one of his grandchildren that three
strangers had come to okonkwo's house. he was therefore waiting



to receive them. he held out his hands to them when they came
into his obi, and after they had shaken hands he asked okonkwo
who they were.

"this is obierika, my great friend. i have already spoken to you
about him."



"yes," said the old man, turning to obierika. "my son has told me
about you, and i am happy you have come to see us. i knew your
father, iweka. he was a grea

 went into an inner room and came back with a
kola nut.

"who are the young men with you?" he asked as he sat down again
on his goatskin. okonkwo told him.

"ah," he said. "welcome, my sons." he presented the kola nut to
them, and when they had seen it and thanked him, he broke it and
they ate.

"go into that room," he said to okonkwo, pointing with his finger.
"you will find a pot of wine there."

okonkwo brought the wine and they began to drink. it was a day
old, and very strong.

"yes," said uchendu after a long silence. "people traveled more in
those days. there is not a single clan in these parts that i do not
know very well. aninta, umuazu, ikeocha, elumelu, abame—i
know them all."



"have you heard," asked obierika, "that abame is no more?"



"how is that?" asked uchendu and okonkwo together.

"abame has been wiped out," said obierika. "it is a strange and
terrible story. if i had not seen the few survivors with my own eyes
and heard their story with my own ears, i would not have

ction among them." obierika again drank a little
of his wine. "and so they killed the white man and tied his iron
horse to their sacred tree because it looked as if it would run away
to call the man's friends. i forgot to tell you another thing which
the oracle said. it said that other white men were on their way.
they were locusts, it said, and that first man was their harbinger
sent to explore the terrain. and so they killed him."



"what did the white man say before they killed him?" asked
uchendu.

"he said nothing," answered one of obierika's companions.

"he said something, only they did not understand him," said
obierika. "he seemed to speak through his nose."



"one of the men told me," said obierika's other companion, "that
he repeated over and over again a word that resembled mbaino.
perhaps he had been going to mbaino and had lost his way."

"anyway," resumed obierika, "they killed him and tied up his iron
horse. this was before the planting season began. for a long time

themselves invisible until the market was full. and they began to
shoot. everybody was killed, except the old and the sick who were
at home and a handful of men and women whose chi were wide
awake and brought them out of that market." he paused.

"their clan is now completely empty. even the sacred fish in their
mysterious lake have fled and the lake has turned the color of
blood. a great evil has come upon their land as the oracle had
warned."



there was a long silence. uchendu ground his teeth together
audibly. then he burst out:



"never kill a man who says nothing. those men of abame were
fools. what did they know about the man?" he ground his teeth
again and told a story to illustrate his point. "mother kite once sent
her daughter to bring food. she went, and brought back a duckling.
'you have done very well,' said mother kite to her daughter, 'but
tell me, what did the mother of this duckling say when you
swooped and carried its child away?' 'it said nothing,' r

ere fools."

"they were fools," said okonkwo after a pause. "they had been
warned that danger was ahead. they should have armed
themselves with their guns and their machetes even when they
went to market."

"they have paid for their foolishness," said obierika, "but i am
greatly afraid. we have heard stories about white men who made
the powerful guns and the strong drinks and took slaves away
across the seas, but no one thought the stories were true."

"there is no story that is not true," said uchendu. "the world has
no end, and what is good among one people is an abomination with
others. we have albinos among us. do you not think that they
came to our clan by mistake, that they have strayed from their way
to a land where everybody is like them?"

okonkwo's first wife soon finished her cooking and set before their
guests a big meal of pounded yams and bitter-leaf soup.



okonkwo's son, nwoye, brought in a pot of sweet wine tapped
from the raffia palm.

really evil diseases, like leprosy and smallpox. it was also the
dumping ground for highly potent fetishes of great medicine men
when they died. an evil forest was, therefore, alive with sinister
forces and powers of darkness. it was such a forest that, the rulers

near to the clan, and so they made them that offer which nobody in
his right senses would accept.

"they want a piece of land to build their shrine," said uchendu to
his peers when they consulted among themselves. "we shall give
them a piece of land." he paused, and there was a murmur of
surprise and disagreement. "let us give them a portion of the evil
forest. they boast about victory over death. let us give them a
real battlefield in which to show their victory." they laughed and
agreed, and sent for the missionaries, whom they had asked to
leave them for a while so that they might "whisper together." they
offered them as much of the evil forest as the

ang to his feet and gripped him by the neck.

"where have you been?" he stammered.

nwoye struggled to free himself from the choking grip.

"answer me," roared okonkwo, "before i kill you!" he seized a
heavy stick that lay on the dwarf wall and hit him two or three
savage blows.

"answer me!" he roared again. nwoye stood looking at him and
did not say a word. the women were screaming outside, afraid to
go in.

"leave that boy at once!" said a voice in the outer compound. it
was okonkwo's uncle, uchendu. "are you mad?"

okonkwo did not answer. but he left hold of nwoye, who walked
away and never returned.




he went back to the church and told mr. kiaga that he had decided
to go to umuofia where the white missionary had set up a school
to teach young christians to read and write.

mr. kiaga's joy was very great. "blessed is he who forsakes his
father and his mother for my sake," he intoned. "those that hear
my words are my father and my mother."

nwoye did not fully understand. but he was ha

and so three goats were slaughtered and a number of fowls. it was
like a wedding feast. there was foo-foo and yam pottage, egusi
soup and bitter-leaf soup and pots and pots of palm-wine.

all the umunna were invited to the feast, all the descendants of
okolo, who had lived about two hundred years before. the oldest
member of this extensive family was okonkwo's uncle, uchendu.
the kola nut was given him to break, and he prayed to the
ancestors. he asked them for health and children. "we do not ask
for wealth because he that has health and children will also have
wealth. we do not pray to have more money but to have more
kinsmen. we are better than animals because we have kinsmen. an
animal rubs its itching flank against a tree, a man asks his kinsman
to scratch him." he prayed especially for okonkwo and his family.
he then broke the kola nut and threw one of the lob

to a feast does not do so to save them from starving. they all have
food in their own homes. when we gather together in the moonlit
village ground it is not because of the moon. every man can see it
in his own compound. we come together because it is good for
kinsmen to do so. you may ask why i am saying all this. i say it
because i fear for the younger generation, for you people." he
waved his arm where most of the young men sat. "as for me, i
have only a short while to live, and so have uchendu and
unachukwu and emefo. but i fear for you young people because
you do not understand how strong is the bond of kinship. you do
not know what it is to speak with one voice. and what is the result?
an abominable religion has settled among you. a man can now



leave his father and his brothers. he can curse the gods of his
fathers and his ancestors, like a hunter's dog that suddenly goes
mad and turns on his master. i fear for you, i fear for the clan." he
turned again to okonkwo and said, "th
