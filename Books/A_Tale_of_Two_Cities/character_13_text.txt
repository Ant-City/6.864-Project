the picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all
eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at monsieur
the marquis. perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his
conscience.

‚Äútruly, you did well,‚Äù said the marquis, felicitously sensible that such
vermin were not to ruffle him, ‚Äúto see a thief accompanying my carriage,
and not open that great mouth of yours. bah! put him aside, monsieur
gabelle!‚Äù

monsieur gabelle was the postmaster, and some other taxing functionary
united; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this
examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an
official manner.

‚Äúbah! go aside!‚Äù said monsieur gabelle.

‚Äúlay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village
to-night, and be sure that his business is honest, gabelle.‚Äù

‚Äúmonseigneur, i am flattered to devote myself to your orders.‚Äù

e run away, fellow?--where is that accursed?‚Äù

the accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen
particular friends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap. some
half-dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out, and
presented him breathless to monsieur the marquis.

‚Äúdid the man run away, dolt, when we stopped for the drag?‚Äù

‚Äúmonseigneur, he precipitated himself over the hill-side, head first, as
a person plunges into the river.‚Äù

‚Äúsee to it, gabelle. go on!‚Äù

the half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the
wheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky
to save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or
they might not have been so fortunate.

the burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the
rise beyond, was soon checked by the steepness of the hill. gradually,
it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the many
sweet scents of

the people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and
all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded
on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was
highly fraught with nothing. already, the mender of roads had penetrated
into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting
himself in the breast with his blue cap. what did all this portend,
and what portended the swift hoisting-up of monsieur gabelle behind
a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said gabelle
(double-laden though the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of
the german ballad of leonora?

it portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the chateau.

the gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added
the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited
through about two hundred years.

it lay back on the pillow of monsieur the marquis. it was like a f

 fountain,
squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and
appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village.
when the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed,
as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there. a
curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered
together at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of
looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only. monsieur gabelle,
chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top
alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his
chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to
the sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need
to ring the tocsin by-and-bye.

the night deepened. the trees environing the old chateau, keeping its
solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened

and windows were. then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter.
soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the
stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.

a faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left
there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. there was
spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the
space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at monsieur
gabelle‚Äôs door. ‚Äúhelp, gabelle! help, every one!‚Äù the tocsin rang
impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none. the
mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood
with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the
sky. ‚Äúit must be forty feet high,‚Äù said they, grimly; and never moved.

the rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away
through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on

 answered, with shrugs and biting
of lips, ‚Äúit must burn.‚Äù

as the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the
village was illuminating. the mender of roads, and the two hundred and
fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of
lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in
every dull little pane of glass. the general scarcity of everything,
occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of
monsieur gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on
that functionary‚Äôs part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to
authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with,
and that post-horses would roast.

the chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. in the roaring and
raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the
infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. with the rising
and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as

 the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied
birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures
trudged away, east, west, north, and south, along the night-enshrouded
roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next
destination. the illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and,
abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy.

not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and
bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that monsieur gabelle had to do with
the collection of rent and taxes--though it was but a small instalment
of taxes, and no rent at all, that gabelle had got in those latter
days--became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his
house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference. whereupon,
monsieur gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel
with himself. the result of that conference was, that gabelle again
withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimney

of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the
parapet, and crush a man or two below.

probably, monsieur gabelle passed a long night up there, with the
distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door,
combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an
ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate,
which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour.

within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were
other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom
the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they
had been born and bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople
less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows, upon whom the
functionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung up

the latent uneasiness in darnay‚Äôs mind was roused to vigourous life
by this letter. the peril of an old servant and a good one, whose
only crime was fidelity to himself and his family, stared him so
reproachfully in the face, that, as he walked to and fro in the temple
considering what to do, he almost hid his face from the passersby.

he knew very well, that in his horror of the deed which had culminated
the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house, in his

but, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was so
far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues, that he had
relinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no
favour in it, won his own private place there, and earned his own
bread. monsieur gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate
on written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little
there was to give--such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have
in the winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in
the summer--and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his
own safety, so that it could not but appear now.

this favoured the desperate resolution charles darnay had begun to make,
that he would go to paris.

trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy
and humanity. with this uneasiness half stifled, and half reproaching
him, he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the
brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison
(injurious to himself) had instantly followed the sneers of monseigneur,
which had stung him bitterly, and those of stryver, which above all were
coarse and galling, for old reasons. upon those, had followed gabelle‚Äôs
letter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his
justice, honour, and good name.

his resolution was made. he must go to paris.

yes. the loadstone rock was drawing him, and he must sail on, until he
struck. he knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger. the intention

it incomplete, presented it before him in an aspect that would be

this universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty
times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day, by
riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping him

days upon his journey in france alone, when he went to bed tired out, in

nothing but the production of the afflicted gabelle‚Äôs letter from his
prison of the abbaye would have got him on so far. his difficulty at the
guard-house in this small place had been such, that he felt his journey
to have come to a crisis. and he was, therefore, as little surprised as
a man could be, to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he
had been remitted until morning, in the middle of the night.

naturally struck by the disagreeable word, charles darnay requested the
speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and french citizen,
in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had
imposed upon him, and which he had paid for.

‚Äúwhere,‚Äù repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him
whatever, ‚Äúare the papers of this prisoner?‚Äù

the drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them. casting his
eyes over gabelle‚Äôs letter, the same personage in authority showed some
disorder and surprise, and looked at darnay with a close attention.

he left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and went
into the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the
gate. looking about him while in this state of suspense, charles

patriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress

why not? the president desired to know.

because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful
to him, and a station that was distasteful to him, and had left
his country--he submitted before the word emigrant in the present
acceptation by the tribunal was in use--to live by his own industry in
england, rather than on the industry of the overladen people of france.

what proof had he of this?

he handed in the names of two witnesses; theophile gabelle, and
alexandre manette.

but he had married in england? the president reminded him.

true, but not an english woman.

a citizeness of france?

yes. by birth.

the president required the name of that citizen. the accused explained
that the citizen was his first witness. he also referred with confidence
to the citizen‚Äôs letter, which had been taken from him at the barrier,
but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before
the president.

the doctor had taken care that it should be there--had assured him that
it would be there--and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced
and read. citizen gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so. citizen
gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the
pressure of business imposed on the tribunal by the multitude of
enemies of the republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly
overlooked in his prison of the abbaye--in fact, had rather passed out
of the tribunal‚Äôs patriotic remembrance--until three days ago; when he
had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the jury‚Äôs
