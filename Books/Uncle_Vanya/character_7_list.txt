Marina Timofeevna (marina timafeevna)  - 
      Marina is a kind, elderly, and devout nurse. Apparently finding a beneficent sense of order in the monotonous life of the estate, she resents the disruption of routine that the others have brought to the household. She delivers religious platitudes throughout the play and offers comfort to a number of characters (Sonya, Astrov, Serbryakov, etc.).
