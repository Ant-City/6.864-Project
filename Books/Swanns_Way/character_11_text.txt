it seemed not so much the
cave of françoise as a little temple of venus. it would be overflowing
with the offerings of the milkman, the fruiterer, the greengrocer, come
sometimes from distant villages to dedicate here the first-fruits of
their fields. and its roof was always surmounted by the cooing of a
dove.

in earlier days i would not have lingered in the sacred grove which
surrounded this temple, for, before going upstairs to read, i would
steal into the little sitting-room which my uncle adolphe, a brother of
my grandfather and an old soldier who had retired from the service as a
major, used to occupy on the ground floor, a room which, even when its
opened windows let in the heat, if not actually the rays of the sun
which seldom penetrated so far, would never fail to emit that vague and
yet fresh odour, suggesting at once an open-air and an old-fashioned
kind of existence, which sets and keeps the nostrils dreaming when one
goes into a disused gun-room. but for some years now i had not

 gone into
my uncle adolphe's room, since he no longer came to combray on account
of a quarrel which had arisen between him and my family, by my fault,
and in the following circumstances: once or twice every month, in paris,
i used to be sent to pay him a. visit, as he was finishing his luncheon,
wearing a plain alpaca coat, and waited upon by his servant in a
working-jacket of striped linen, purple and white. he would complain
that i had not been to see him for a long time; that he was being
neglected; he would offer me

o him would be incongruous and petty, and might make
him think that i regarded myself as bound to shew him no more than the
commonest form of courtesy. i decided to abstain from so inadequate a
gesture, and turned my head away. my uncle thought that, in doing so i
was obeying my parents' orders; he never forgave them; and though he
did not die until many years later, not one of us ever set eyes on him
again.

and so i no longer used to go into the little sitting-room (now kept
shut) of my uncle adolphe; instead, after hanging about on the outskirts
of the back-kitchen until françoise appeared on its threshold and
announced: "i am going to let the kitchen-maid serve the coffee and take
up the hot water; it is time i went off to mme. octave," i would then
decide to go indoors, and would go straight upstairs to my room to read.
the kitchen-maid was an abstract personality, a permanent institution
to which an invariable set of attributes assured a sort of fixity and
continuity and identity throu

 appealed to the proprieties or pleaded
some engagement. when he spoke of going to a charity entertainment, or a
private view, or a first-night at which she was to be present, she would
expostulate that he wished to advertise their relations in public, that
he was treating her like a woman off the streets. things came to such a
pitch that, in an effort to save himself from being altogether forbidden
to meet her anywhere, swann, remembering that she knew and was deeply
attached to my great-uncle adolphe, whose friend he himself also
had been, went one day to see him in his little flat in the rue
de bellechasse, to ask him to use his influence with odette. as it
happened, she invariably adopted, when she spoke to swann about my
uncle, a poetical tone, saying: "ah, he! he is not in the least
like you; it is an exquisite thing, a great, a beautiful thing, his
friendship for me. he's not the sort of man who would have so little
consideration for me as to let himself be seen with me everywhere in

him all the more; he advised odette to let swann meet her
everywhere, and as often as he pleased. a few days later odette told
swann that she had just had a rude awakening; she had discovered that
my uncle was the same as other men; he had tried to take her by assault.
she calmed swann, who, at first, was for rushing out to challenge my
uncle to a duel, but he refused to shake hands with him when they met
again. he regretted this rupture all the more because he had hoped, if
he had met my uncle adolphe again sometimes and had contrived to talk
things over with him in strict confidence, to be able to get him to
throw a light on certain rumours with regard to the life that odette had
led, in the old days, at nice. for my uncle adolphe used to spend the
winter there, and swann thought that it might indeed have been there,
perhaps, that he had first known odette. the few words which some one
had let fall, in his hearing, about a man who, it appeared, had been
odette's lover, had left swann dumbfo
