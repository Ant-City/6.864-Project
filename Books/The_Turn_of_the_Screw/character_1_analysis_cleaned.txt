mrs.[CHARACTER] 
an illiterate servant at bly, mrs.[CHARACTER] provides the
governess with open ears and loyal support. although the governess
thinks her simple minded and slow witted, mrs.[CHARACTER] knows more
of the story than the governess fathoms and is as capable of piecing
things together as is the governess, though slower to leap to dire
conclusions. although mrs.[CHARACTER] is the source for most of the governess's
information, the governess does not take her words at face value
or ask mrs.[CHARACTER] for her opinions. instead, the governess uses
mrs.[CHARACTER] as a "receptacle of lurid things." the governess
frequently attempts to seize moments alone with mrs.[CHARACTER] so that
she can try out her latest speculations. mrs.[CHARACTER] is usually skeptical
of these speculations, but the governess takes mrs.[CHARACTER]'s incredulity
for astonished belief. like the reader, mrs.[CHARACTER] is willing to
hear the governess out but doesn't necessarily agree with her logic
or conclusions.
