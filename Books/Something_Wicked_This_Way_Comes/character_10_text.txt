wanted to be layered under sixteen
blankets and a pillow.
'mr tetley?' said will, quietly.
for now there were two wooden indians upright in ripe tobacco darkness. mr tetley, amidst
his jest, had frozen, mouth open, listening.
'mr tetley?'
he heard something far away on the wind, but couldn't say what it was.
the boys backed off.
he did not see them. he did not move. he only listened.
they left him. they ran.
in the fourth empty block from the library, the boys came upon a third wooden indian.
mr crosetti, in front of his barber shop, his door key in his trembling fingers, did not see them
stop.
what had stopped them?
a teardrop.
it moved shining down mr crosetti's left cheek. he breathed heavily.
'crosetti, you fool! something happens, nothing happens, you cry like a baby!'
mr crosetti took a trembling breath, snuffing. 'don't you smell it?'
jim and will sniffed.
'licorice!'
'heck, no. cotton candy!'
'i haven't smelled that in years,' said mr crosetti.
jim snorted. 'it's around.'
'yes, but who

notices? when? now, my nose tells me, breathe! and i'm crying. why?
because iremember how a long time ago, boys ate that stuff. why haven't i stopped to think
and smell the last thirty years?'
'you're busy, mr crosetti,' will said. 'you haven't got time.'
mr crosetti wiped his eyes. 'where does that smell come from? there's no place in town
sells cotton candy. only circuses.'
'hey,' said will. 'that's right!'
'well, crosetti is done crying.' the barber blew his nose and turned to lock his shop door.as
he did this, will watched the barber's pole whirl its red serpentine up out of nothing, leading his
gaze around,rising to vanish into more nothing. on countless moons will had stood here trying
to unravel that ribbon, watch it come, go, end without ending.
mr crosetti put his hand to the light switch under the spinning pole.
'don't,' said will. then, murmuring, 'don't turn it off.' mr crosetti looked at the pole, as i

me, thought will, seeing the guillotine flash, the egyptian mirrors unfold accordions of light,
and the sulphur-skinned devil-man sipping lava, like gunpowder tea.
'that music…' jim murmured. 'calliope. must be coming tonight!'
'carnivals come at sunrise.'
‘yeah, but what about the licorice and cotton candy we smelled, close?'
and will thought of the smells and the sounds flowing on the river of wind from beyond the
darkening houses, mr tetley listening by his wooden indian friend, mr crosetti with the single
tear shining down his cheek, and the barber's pole sliding its red tongue up and around forever
out of nowhere and away to eternity.
will's teeth chattered.
'let's go home.'
'we are home!' cried jim, surprised.
for, not knowing it, they had reached their separate houses and now moved up separate
walks.
on his porch, jim leaned over and called softly.
'will.you're not mad?'
'heck, no.'
'we won't go by that street, that house, the theatre, again for a month.a year! i swear.'
'sure

moving back, back. i know it's printed on my eyeball like i been struck by lightning!
'miss foley!' said will.
now a pink face stuck out through the dim frozen necklaces of storm.
'we got to tell you a terrible thing.'
jim struck will's elbow, hard, to shut him.
now the body came out through the dark watery flow of beads. the rain shushed behind the
small boy.
miss foley leaned toward him, expectant. jim gripped his elbow, fiercely. he stammered,
flushed, then spat it out:
'mr crosetti!'
quite suddenly, clearly he saw the sign in the barber's window. the sign seen but not seen
as they ran by:
closed on account of illness.
'mr crosetti!' he repeated, and added swiftly. 'he's…dead!'
'what…the barber?'
'the barber?' echoed jim.
'see this haircut?' will turned, trembling, his hand to his head. 'he did it.and we just walked
by there and the sign was up and people told us - '
'what a shame.' miss foley was reaching out to fetch the strange boy forward: 'i'm so sorry.

flick. the nephew made an x-ray of both, showing them, no doubt, as cold bones trembling
in warm flesh. he stuck out his hand.
'tomorrow, then. meet you by the side-shows.'
'swell!' jim grabbed the small hand.
'so long!' will jumped out the door, then turned with a last agonized appeal to the teacher.
'miss foley…?'
'yes, will?'
don't go with that boy, he thought. don't go near the shows.stay home, oh please! but then
he said:
'mr crosetti's dead.'
she nodded, touched, waiting for his tears.and while she waited, he dragged jim outside
and the door swung shut on miss foley and the pink small face with the lenses in it going blinkclick,
snapshotting two incoherent boys, and them fumbling down the steps in october dark,
while the merry-go-round started again in will's head,rushing while the leaves in the trees
above cracked and fried with wind.aside, will spluttered, 'jim, you shook hands with him! mr
cooger! you're not going to mee

two folks already, mr electrico, and that terrible crazy dwarf! all kinds of things can go wrong
with people on that darn machine. we know, we seen it. maybe they squashed the lightningrod
man down that way on purpose, or maybe something went wrong. fact is, he wound up in
a wine press anyway, got run over by a steam-roller carousel and's so crazy now he doesn't
even know us! ain't that enough to scare the jesus out of you, jim? why, maybe even mr
crosetti - '
'mr crosetti's on vacation.'
'maybe yes, maybe no. there's his shop. there's the sign: closed on account of
illness. what kind of illness, jim? he eat too much candy out at the show? he get seasick on
everybody's favourite ride?'
'cut it, will.'
'no, sir, i won't cut it.sure, sure, the merry-go-round sounds keen.you think i like being
thirteen all the time? not me! but for cri-yi, jim, face it, you don't really want to be twenty!'

the small parade moved, soundless, past the eternally revolving, ending-but-unending
candy serpentine of mr. crosetti's barber pole, past all the darkening or darkened shops, the
emptying streets, for people were home now from the church suppers, or out at the carnival for
the last side show or the last high-ladder diver floating like milkweed down the night.
will's feet, far away below, clubbed the sidewalk. one, two, he thought, someone tells me
left,right. dragonfly whispers: one-two.
is jim in the parade?! will's eyes flicked the briefest to one side.yes! but who's the other
little one? the gone-mad, every

will, in a swift moment, saw the thin man and his burden go over a hill among all the
footprints of the vanished carnival race.
will's face shadowed this way, then that, pulled by the swift concussions, the tumults, the
deaths, the fleeing away of souls. cooger, dark,skeleton, dwarf-who-was-lightning-rodsalesman,
don't run, come back! miss foley, where are you? mr. crosetti! it's over! be still!
quiet! it's all right. come back, come back!
but the wind was blowing their footprints out of the grass and they might run forever now
trying to outflee themselves.
so will turned back astride jim and pushed the chest and let go, pushed and let go, then,
trembling, touched his dear friend's cheek.
‘jim…?’
but jim was cold as spaded earth.

beneath the cold was a fugitive warmness, in the white skin lay some small color, but when
