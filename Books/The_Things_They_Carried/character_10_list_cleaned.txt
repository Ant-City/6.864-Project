[CHARACTER] - 
                 a
minor character whose guilt over his injury of lee strunk causes
him to break his own nose. jensen's relief after strunk's death
is an illustration of the perspective soldiers are forced to assume.
instead of mourning the loss of his friend, jensen is glad to know
that the pact the two made--and that he broke--has now become obsolete.
