    of loss, of slaughter, and discomfiture:
    guienne, champagne, rheims, orleans,
    paris, guysors, poictiers, are all quite lost.
  bedford. what say'st thou, man, before dead henry's corse?
    speak softly, or the loss of those great towns
    will make him burst his lead and rise from death.
  gloucester. is paris lost? is rouen yielded up?
    if henry were recall'd to life again,
    these news would cause him once more yield the ghost.
  exeter. how were they lost? what treachery was us'd?

    and hardly keeps his men from mutiny,
    since they, so few, watch such a multitude.
  exeter. remember, lords, your oaths to henry sworn,
    either to quell the dauphin utterly,
    or bring him in obedience to your yoke.

    how wert thou handled being prisoner?

  talbot. the earl of bedford had a prisoner
    call'd the brave lord ponton de santrailles;
    for him was i exchang'd and ransomed.
    but with a baser man of arms by far
    once, in contempt, they would have barter'd me;
    which i disdaining scorn'd, and craved death
    rather than i would be so vile esteem'd.
    in fine, redeem'd i was as i desir'd.
    but, o! the treacherous fastolfe wounds my heart
    whom with my bare fists i would execute,
    if i now had him brought into my power.
