cbeth shall neuer vanquish'd be, vntill
great byrnam wood, to high dunsmane hill
shall come against him.

descend.

  macb. that will neuer bee:
who can impresse the forrest, bid the tree
vnfixe his earth-bound root? sweet boadments, good:
rebellious dead, rise neuer till the wood
of byrnan rise, and our high plac'd macbeth
shall liue the lease of nature, pay his breath
to time, and mortall custome. yet my hart
throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art
can tell so much: shall banquo's issue euer
reigne in this kingdome?
  all. seeke to know no more

   macb. i will be satisfied. deny me this,
and an eternall curse fall on you: let me know.
why sinkes that caldron? & what noise is this?

hoboyes

  1 shew

   2 shew

   3 shew

   all. shew his eyes, and greeue his hart,
come like shadowes, so depart.

a shew of eight kings, and banquo last, with a glasse in his hand.

  macb. thou art too like the spirit of banquo: down:
thy crowne do's seare mine eye

-bals. and thy haire
thou other gold-bound-brow, is like the first:
a third, is like the former. filthy hagges,
why do you shew me this? - a fourth? start eyes!
what will the line stretch out to'th' cracke of doome?
another yet? a seauenth? ile see no more:
and yet the eighth appeares, who beares a glasse,
which shewes me many more: and some i see,
that two-fold balles, and trebble scepters carry.
horrible sight: now i see 'tis true,
for the blood-bolter'd banquo smiles vpon me,
and points at them for his. what? is this so?
  1 i sir, all this is so. but why
stands macbeth thus amazedly?
come sisters, cheere we vp his sprights,
and shew the best of our delights.
ile charme the ayre to giue a sound,
while you performe your antique round:
that this great king may kindly say,
our duties, did his welcome pay.

musicke. the witches dance, and vanish.

  macb. where are they? gone?
let this pernitious houre,
stand aye accursed in the kalender.

bia will not sweeten this little hand.
oh, oh, oh

   doct. what a sigh is there? the hart is sorely charg'd

   gent. i would not haue such a heart in my bosome,
for the dignity of the whole body

   doct. well, well, well

   gent. pray god it be sir

   doct. this disease is beyond my practise: yet i haue
knowne those which haue walkt in their sleep, who haue
dyed holily in their beds

   lad. wash your hands, put on your night-gowne,
looke not so pale: i tell you yet againe banquo's buried;
he cannot come out on's graue

   doct. euen so?
  lady. to bed, to bed: there's knocking at the gate:
come, come, come, come, giue me your hand: what's
done, cannot be vndone. to bed, to bed, to bed.

exit lady.

  doct. will she go now to bed?
  gent. directly

   doct. foule whisp'rings are abroad: vnnaturall deeds
do breed vnnaturall troubles: infected mindes
to their deafe pillowes will discharge their secrets:
more needs she the diuine, then the physitian:
god,
