ector, whose patience
    is as a virtue fix'd, to-day was mov'd.
    he chid andromache, and struck his armourer;
    and, like as there were husbandry in war,
    before the sun rose he was harness'd light,
    and to the field goes he; where every flower
    did as a prophet weep what it foresaw
    in hector's wrath.
  cressida. what was his cause of anger?
  alexander. the noise goes, this: there is among the greeks
    a lord of troyan blood, nephew to hector;
    they call him ajax.
  cressida. good; and what of him?
  alexander. they say he is a very man per se,
    and stands alone.
  cressida. so do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no
    legs.
  alexander. this man, lady, hath robb'd many beasts of their
    particular additions: he is as valiant as a lion, churlish as the
    bear, slow as the elephant-a man into whom nature hath so crowded
    humours that his valour is crush'd into folly, his folly sauced
    with discretion. there is no man

    ajax is grown self-will'd and bears his head
    in such a rein, in full as proud a place
    as broad achilles; keeps his tent like him;
    makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war
    bold as an oracle, and sets thersites,
    a slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
    to match us in comparisons with dirt,
    to weaken and discredit our exposure,

  nestor. i see them not with my old eyes. what are they?
  ulysses. what glory our achilles shares from hector,
    were he not proud, we all should wear with him;
    but he already is too insolent;
    and it were better parch in afric sun
    than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,
    should he scape hector fair. if he were foil'd,
    why, then we do our main opinion crush
    in taint of our best man. no, make a lott'ry;
    and, by device, let blockish ajax draw
    the sort to fight with hector. among ourselves
    give him allowance for the better man;
    for that will physic the great myrmidon,
    who broils in loud applause, and make him fall
    his crest, that prouder than blue iris bends.
    if the dull brainless ajax come safe off,
    we'll dress him up in voices; if he fail,
    yet go we under our opinion still
    that we have better men. but, hit or miss,
    our project's life this shape of sense assumes-

  thersites. i would thou didst itch from head to foot and i had the

    he has beat my bones. i will buy nine sparrows for a penny, and
    his pia mater is not worth the ninth part of a sparrow. this
    lord, achilles, ajax-who wears his wit in his belly and his guts
    in his head-i'll tell you what i say of him.
  achilles. what?
  thersites. i say this ajax-        [ajax offers to strike him]
  achilles. nay, good ajax.
  thersites. has not so much wit-
  achilles. nay, i must hold you.

  ajax. well, go to, go to.
  thersites. i serve here voluntary.
  achilles. your last service was suff'rance; 'twas not voluntary. no
