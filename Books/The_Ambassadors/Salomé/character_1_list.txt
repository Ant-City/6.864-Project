Herod Antipas - 
      The Tetrarch of Judea, Herod is Herodias's second husband and Salome's stepfather. Herod deposed, imprisoned, and executed Salome's father--his own elder brother the former king--and wedded Herodias in what Jokanaan calls an incestuous union. Herod is in fear of Jokanaan, whom he has imprisoned, as he cannot know if Jokanaan speaks the word of God and if his many prophecies of his ruin will come to pass. He is also tormented by a host of omens--the blood in which he slips, the beating wings of the angel of death, his burning and bloody garland--that foretell the death about to strike the palace.
