 want to know more about socialism?” he asked.

jurgis started. “i--i--” he stammered. “is it socialism? i didn’t know.
i want to know about what you spoke of--i want to help. i have been
through all that.”

“where do you live?” asked the other.

“i have no home,” said jurgis, “i am out of work.”

“you are a foreigner, are you not?”

“lithuanian, sir.”

the man thought for a moment, and then turned to his friend. “who is
there, walters?” he asked. “there is ostrinski--but he is a pole--”

“ostrinski speaks lithuanian,” said the other. “all right, then; would
you mind seeing if he has gone yet?”

the other started away, and the speaker looked at jurgis again. he had
deep, black eyes, and a face full of gentleness and pain. “you must
excuse me, comrade,” he said. “i am just tired out--i have spoken every
day for the last month. i will introduce you to some one who will be
able to help you as well as i could--”

the messenger had had to go no

 further than the door, he came back,
followed by a man whom he introduced to jurgis as “comrade ostrinski.”
 comrade ostrinski was a little man, scarcely up to jurgis’s shoulder,
wizened and wrinkled, very ugly, and slightly lame. he had on a
long-tailed black coat, worn green at the seams and the buttonholes; his
eyes must have been weak, for he wore green spectacles that gave him
a grotesque appearance. but his handclasp was hearty, and he spoke in
lithuanian, which warmed jurgis to him.

“you want to know about socialism?” he said. “surely. let us go out and
take a stroll, where we can be quiet and talk some

.”

and so jurgis bade farewell to the master wizard, and went out.
ostrinski asked where he lived, offering to walk in that direction;
and so he had to explain once more that he was without a home. at the
other’s request he told his story; how he had come to america, and
what had happened to him in the stockyards, and how his family had been
broken up, and how he had become a wanderer. so much the little man
heard, and then he pressed jurgis’s arm tightly. “you have been through
the mill, comrade!” he said. “we will make a fighter out of you!”

then ostrinsk

i in turn explained his circumstances. he would have asked
jurgis to his home--but he had only two rooms, and had no bed to offer.
he would have given up his own bed, but his wife was ill. later on, when
he understood that otherwise jurgis would have to sleep in a hallway,
he offered him his kitchen floor, a chance which the other was only too
glad to accept. “perhaps tomorrow we can do better,” said ostrinski. “we
try not to let a comrade starve.”

ostrinski’s home was in the ghetto district, where he had two rooms in
the basement of a tenement. there was a baby crying as they entered,
and he closed the door leading into the bedroom. he had three young
children, he explained, and a baby had just come. he drew up two chairs
near the kitchen stove, adding that jurgis must excuse the disorder of
the place, since at such a time one’s domestic arrangements were upset.
half of the kitchen was given up to a workbench, which was piled with
clothing, an

d ostrinski explained that he was a “pants finisher.” he
brought great bundles of clothing here to his home, where he and his
wife worked on them. he made a living at it, but it was getting harder
all the time, because his eyes were failing. what would come when they
gave out he could not tell; there had been no saving anything--a man
could barely keep alive by twelve or fourteen hours’ work a day. the
finishing of pants did not take much skill, and anybody could learn it,
and so the pay was forever

and, to a socialist,
the victory of his class was his victory. also he had always the
progress to encourage him; here in chicago, for instance, the movement
was growing by leaps and bounds. chicago was the industrial center
of the country, and nowhere else were the unions so strong; but their
organizations did the workers little good, for the employers were
organized, also; and so the strikes generally failed, and as fast as the
unions were broken up the men were coming over to the socialists.

ostrinski explained the organization of the party, the machinery by
which the proletariat was educating itself. there were “locals” in every
big city and town, and they were being organized rapidly in the smaller
places; a local had anywhere from six to a thousand members, and there
were fourteen hundred of them in all, with a total of about twenty-five
thousand members, who paid dues to support the organization. “local cook
county,” as the city organization was called, had eighty branch locals,

and it alone was spending several thousand dollars in the campaign. it
published a weekly in english, and one each in bohemian and german; also
there was a monthly published in chicago, and a cooperative publishing
house, that issued a million and a half of socialist books and pamphlets
every year. all this was the growth of the last few years--there had
been almost nothing of it when ostrinski first came to chicago.

ostrinski was a pole, about fifty years of age. he had lived in silesia,
a member of a despised and persecuted race, and had taken part in the
proletarian movement in the early seventies, when bismarck, having
conquered france, had turned his policy of blood and iron upon the
“international.” ostrinski himself had twice been in jail, but he had
been young then, and had not cared. he had had more of his share of the
fight, though, for just when socialism had broken all its barriers and
become the grea

t political force of the empire, he had come to america,
and begun all over again. in america every one had laughed at the mere
idea of socialism then--in america all men were free. as if political
liberty made wage slavery any the more tolerable! said ostrinski.

the little tailor sat tilted back in his stiff kitchen chair, with his
feet stretched out upon the empty stove, and speaking in low whispers,
so as not to waken those in the next room. to jurgis he seemed a
scarcely less wonderful person than the speaker at the meeting; he was
poor, the lowest of the low, hunger-driven and miserable--and yet how
much he knew, how much he had dared and achieved, what a hero he had
been! there were others like him, too--thousands like him, and all of
them worki

ngmen! that all this wonderful machinery of progress had been
created by his fellows--jurgis could not believe it, it seemed too good
to be true.

that was always the way, said ostrinski; when a man was first converted
to socialism he was like a crazy person--he could not understand how
others could fail to see it, and he expected to convert all the world
the first week. after a while he would realize how hard a task it was;
and then it would be fortunate that other new hands kept coming, to save
him from settling down into a rut. just now jurgis would have plenty of
chance to vent his excitement, for a presidential campaign was on, and
everybody was talking politics. ostrinski

 would take him to the next
meeting of the branch local, and introduce him, and he might join the
party. the dues were five cents a week, but any one who could not afford
this might be excused from paying. the socialist party was a really
democratic political organization--it was controlled absolutely by
its own membership, and had no bosses. all of these things ostrinski
explained, as also the principles of the party. you might say that there
was really but one socialist principle--that of “no compromise,” which
was the essence of the proletarian movement all over the world. when a
socialist was elected to office he voted with old party legislators for
any measure that was likely to be of help to the working class, but
he never forgot that these concessions, whatever they might be, were
trifles compared with the great purpose--the organizing of the working

class for the revolution. so far, the rule in america had been that
one socialist made another socialist once every two years; and if
they should maintain the same rate they would carry the country in
1912--though not all of them expected to succeed as quickly as that.

the socialists were organized in every civilized nation; it was an
international political party, said ostrinski, the greatest the world
had ever known. it numbered thirty million of adherents, and it cast
eight million votes. it had started its first newspaper in japan, and
elected its first deputy in argentina; in france it named members of
cabinets, and in italy and australia it held the balance of power and
turned out ministries. in germany, where its vote was more than a third
of the total vote of the empire, all other parties and powers had united
to fight it. it would not do, ostrinski explained, f

itations. for four years, now, jurgis had been wondering and
blundering in the depths of a wilderness; and here, suddenly, a hand
reached down and seized him, and lifted him out of it, and set him upon
a mountain-top, from which he could survey it all--could see the paths
from which he had wandered, the morasses into which he had stumbled, the
hiding places of the beasts of prey that had fallen upon him. there
were his packingtown experiences, for instance--what was there about
packingtown that ostrinski could not explain! to jurgis the packers had
been equivalent to fate; ostrinski showed him that they were the beef
trust. they were a gigantic combination of capital, which had crushed
all opposition, and overthrown the laws of the land, and was preying
upon the people. jurgis recollected how, when he had first come to
packingtown, he had stood and watched the hog-killing, and thought how
cruel and savage it was, and come away congratulating himself that he
was not a hog; now his new acquaintan

ight franchises--it already owned the leather and the grain
business of the country. the people were tremendously stirred up over
its encroachments, but nobody had any remedy to suggest; it was the task
of socialists to teach and organize them, and prepare them for the time
when they were to seize the huge machine called the beef trust, and use
it to produce food for human beings and not to heap up fortunes for a
band of pirates. it was long after midnight when jurgis lay down upon
the floor of ostrinski’s kitchen; and yet it was an hour before he
could get to sleep, for the glory of that joyful vision of the people of
packingtown marching in and taking possession of the union stockyards!


chapter 30


jurgis had breakfast with ostrinski and his family, and then he went
home to elzbieta. he was no longer shy about it--when he went in,
instead of saying all the things he had been planning to say, he started
to tell elzbieta about the revolution! at first she thought he was out
of his mind, an

 made up my mind that’s
enough. would you be a porter?”

“yes, sir.”

“it’s hard work. you’ll have to clean floors and wash spittoons and fill
lamps and handle trunks--”

“i’m willing, sir.”

“all right. i’ll pay you thirty a month and board, and you can begin
now, if you feel like it. you can put on the other fellow’s rig.”

and so jurgis fell to work, and toiled like a trojan till night. then
he went and told elzbieta, and also, late as it was, he paid a visit to
ostrinski to let him know of his good fortune. here he received a great
surprise, for when he was describing the location of the hotel ostrinski
interrupted suddenly, “not hinds’s!”

“yes,” said jurgis, “that’s the name.”

to which the other replied, “then you’ve got the best boss in
chicago--he’s a state organizer of our party, and one of our best-known
speakers!”

so the next morning jurgis went to his employer and told him; and the
man seized him by the hand and shook it. “by
