Poins, Peto, Bardolph  - 
      Friends of Falstaff and Prince Hal. Formerly highwaymen and robbers, they have, like Falstaff, gained money and prestige since the Battle of Shrewsbury. Poins is the smartest of the bunch and the closest to Hal. Bardolph, an insatiable drinker, has a famously bright red nose.
