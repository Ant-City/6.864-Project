[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER]'s primary role in surfacing is to crystallize the
narrator's opinions about love, sex, and marriage. [CHARACTER]'s constant chatter helps
the narrator to better understand relationships. she asks whether the narrator
takes birth control, mentioning the blood clot she developed in her leg as a
result of taking the pill. [CHARACTER]'s frankness about contraception allows the
narrator to identify contraception as a male invention that puts
females at risk. when the narrator asks [CHARACTER] about marriage, [CHARACTER]'s
comparison of marriage to skiing blindly down a hill helps
solidify the narrator's fear of marriage. also, [CHARACTER]'s admission that david
either withholds sex or hurts her during sex helps the narrator to see the way
men use sex as a weapon. 

the narrator also observes the psychological cruelty that men inflict on
women through the way that [CHARACTER] crumbles in the face of david's cruel jokes. the
degradation of [CHARACTER]'s marriage confirms the narrator's suspicions about marriage
in general. at first, the narrator seems to envy [CHARACTER]'s love for her husband,
and she marvels at the way [CHARACTER] keeps her marriage together. however, the
narrator eventually comes to understand [CHARACTER]'s marriage as one balanced by hate
rather than love, and david's cynicism allows her to reject marriage altogether.
[CHARACTER]'s life as a whole becomes a cautionary tale for the narrator. the narrator
learns through [CHARACTER] the pitfalls of unhappy marriage, empty sex, and fractured
love.
