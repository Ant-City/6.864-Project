begin to speak words she never wanted to hear? 

the beginning of that performance was  clear enough. it was while she and metzger were waiting for ancillary letters to be 

granted representatives in arizona, texas, new york and florida, where inverarity had developed real estate, and in delaware, 
where he'd been incorporated. the two of them, followed by a convertibleful of the paranoids miles, dean, serge and leonard and 
their chicks, had decided to spend the day out at fangoso lagoons, one of inverarity's last big projects. the trip out was uneventful 

 
except for two or three collisions the paranoids almost had owing to serge, the driver, not being able to see through his hair. he 
was persuaded to hand over the wheel to one of the girls. somewhere beyond the battening, urged sweep of three-bedroom houses 
rushing by their thousands across all the dark beige hills, somehow implicit in an arrogance or

was headed toward them. two figures in gray suits crouched behind its windshield. "metz, i'm running for it. if he stops by here 
don't bully him, he's my client." and he disappeared down the ladder. oedipa with a sigh collapsed on her back and stared 
through the wind at the empty blue sky. soon she heard the "godzilla ii" starting up.

glowing roaches of their cigarettes like a flipcard section at a football game to spell out alternate s's and o's, attracted the 
attention of the fangoso lagoons security force, a garrison against the night made up of one-time cowboy actors and l. a. 
motorcycle cops. the time in between had been whiled away with songs by the paranoids, and juicing, and feeding pieces of 
eggplant sandwich to a flock of not too bright seagulls who'd mistaken fangoso langoo

"but the cops." 

"i'll be a fugitive." later she couldn't remember if they'd said anything else. at the station they kissed goodbye, all of 

them. as mucho walked away he was whistling something complicated, twelve-tone. oedipa sat with her forehead resting on the 
steering wheel and remembered that she hadn't asked him about the trys-tero cancellation on his letter. but by then it was too 
late to make any difference.

when she got back to echo courts, she found miles, dean, serge and leonard arranged around and on the diving board at the end of 
the swimming pool with all their instruments, so composed and motionless that some photographer, hidden from oedipa, might 
have been shooting them for an album illustration. 
"what's happening?" said oedipa. 

"your young man," replied miles, "metzger, really put it to serge, our counter-tenor. the lad is crackers with grief." 

"he's right, missus," said serge. "i even wrote a song about it, whose arrangement features none other than me,
